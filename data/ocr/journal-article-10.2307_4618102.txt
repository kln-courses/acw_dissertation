<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FATHER'S BOWL: ANALYSIS OF A DOGON VERSION OF AT 4801 Genevieve Calame-Griaule The tale of the kind and unkind girls (AT 480) is one of the most widely distributed in the world.2 It seems deeply rooted in the majority of African cultures, as is attested by its frequency and re- markable permanence. In fact, versions collected today are very similar to those collected in the past and all strikingly resemble the structure of European examples of this type.3 In this article I will discuss the significance of this tale by treat- ing an African example I collected in 1969 among the Dogon (Mali).4 The ensuing analysis does not pretend to be exhaustive or definitive; experience teaches us that such rich and complex nar- ratives allow for the possibility of multiple levels of interpretation. In the course of previous tale analyses, the theme of initiatory quests repeatedly commanded my attention.5 Passage from child- hood to adulthood and integration into the social group pose a fundamental problem in the majority of human societies. In Africa this passage is marked by rites and institutions whose configura- tion (all differences notwithstanding) can be reduced to a structur- al scheme comprising the following elements: separation from one's family and retreat into the "bush" (the forest), tests (physi- cal, moral, and intellectual), teachings, symbolic death and rebirth, and return to and reintegration into the group. During initiation a child undergoes essential corporal transfor- mations (circumcision, excision, etc.) that make him or her a sex- ually differentiated being-an adult capable of procreation. Initia- tion, in effect, is a conquest not only of knowledge and social virtues, but also (and perhaps above all) of fecundity. In this article I intend to demonstrate that this initiatory scheme can be found, transposed into symbolic form, in the Dogon version of the kind and unkind girls. The general develop- ment of the plot (see appended Dogon tale, in extenso) can be outlined as follows: A. The Kind Girl Section Instigated by her stepmother, she commits a fault. In order to right the wrong, she leaves the house for a faraway pond. On the way she encounters two persons and behaves politely. At the pond she meets an old woman and behaves politely. She is dragged to the bottom of the water by a supernatural being. This being tests her. She is rewarded for her good behavior. She returns home followed by innumerable riches.</page><page sequence="2">169 THE FATHER'S BOWL B. The Unkind Girl Section Out of her jealousy, the stepmother pushes her daughter to com- mit the same fault as the kind girl. The daughter leaves home for the faraway pond. On the way she has the same encounters as the kind girl but be- haves impolitely. At the pond she meets the old woman and is impolite. She is dragged to the bottom of the water by a supernatural being. This being tests her but she does the opposite of what she is asked to do. She is punished. She returns home followed by filth. This outline is clearly similar to that proposed by Aarne and Thompson for AT 480, which is organized into symmetrical parts that oppose the inverse behavior of two characters, but my outline brings into play an element not underscored in the index but that seems fundamental to the tale: the initial fault that provokes the departure of the two heroines. Each element of the tale must be analyzed in relation to its role in Dogon culture in order to un- veil the significance of this initial fault. At first glance the initial situation does not appear to be ab- normal. In most cases a young girl who loses her mother does live with her stepmother (her mother's cowife) and perform the house- hold chores. It is not explicitly stated that the woman mistreats her stepdaughter (as is frequently the case in tales of this type), but the fact that she refuses to answer the girl's questions (a grave form of impolite behavior among the Dogon) implies mistreatment -a type of behavior that conforms with the archetypal image of the stepmother in Dogon discourse. Though it is true that the step- mother will exhibit the same attitude toward her own daughter in the second part of the tale, her intentions are very different, as is evident when she says: "So, the daughter of my cowife received something. What a disaster!" There is also a qualitative difference in the relationship between the stepmother and the two girls. The classificatory term for mother is na; in this tale the real daughter uses the term ndd (equivalent to mom) and thereby highlights the affective bond between the two of them. It is clear that the story thus brings into play a classic tale situation; that is, the confronta- tion of the stepmother, her preferred daughter, and her unloved stepdaughter. Another character who does not appear in person nevertheless plays a key role in the development of the plot: the father, repre- sented by his bowl. In fact, it is this very bowl that provokes the</page><page sequence="3">170 Genevikve Calame-Griaule conflict between the heroine and her stepmother and, by exten- sion, it is the father who is the object of the fault that will lead to the heroine's departure from home.6 We shall see how, in this case, the father-daughter relationship is also linked to the deep inten- tions of the story. The bowl (bai~i) in question is a round hollow wooden con- tainer (comparable to our salad bowls) whose exterior is decorated with geometric designs traced by means of a hot steel blade (the flat section of the same tool is used to darken certain surfaces of the wood). For the Dogon, this object symbolizes the person to whom it belongs. The family head's bowl is particularly important and must never be taken away from the house for fear he might die. In fact, during funerary ceremonies, the dead person is repre- sented by this bowl (among other of his personal effects), which is "impregnated by the food and the gestures of its vanished owner, symbol of his body, symbol of his human nature."'7 On a day-to- day level, it is used as a container only for cooked foods ready to be consumed (in symbolic association with the fire that was used to decorate its outside surface). If the father in the tale is represented by an object whose form and culinary use seem to associate it with femininity (and not by an object whose symbolism is more clearly and overtly masculine), it is because the tale focuses on the nurturing function of the family head. The Adansonia digita baobab, whose Dogon denomination, 9ra, signifies "slipping," is a tree associated with the notion of materni- ty. It is often compared to a "belly" because its trunk, often hol- low, is curvilinear, and it is also associated with a matrix or an egg because of the diverse particularities of its oval fruit." All of its parts are edible or usable by humans. The leaves, which are men- tioned in the tale, are reduced to powder form and furnish a much appreciated condiment for the sauce accompanying millet paste; the slippery consistency of this powder (very fine and silky to the touch when mixed with water) explains, according to the Dogon, the name given to the tree. Whether this etymological correlation is correct or not, it interestingly highlights the symbolic impor- tance attributed to this quality. We do not know whether the Dogon endow this "slipperiness" with sexual connotations, but it seems quite logical to make the connection. Even without doing so, the different symbolic affinities of the tree permit us to associ- ate the leaf powder with fertility. Given these correlations, it is not too audacious to assume that by putting the raw powder into</page><page sequence="4">171 THE FATHER'S BOWL her father's bowl the girl in the tale commits symbolic incest- evoked here not only by the incongruous association of father and baobab but also by the confusion between raw and cooked (equiv- alent to the confusion between generations, which is one of the characteristics of incest).' The virgin daughter is not pubescent and therefore is still on the side of nature and the raw, whereas the father's bowl, decorated with the use of fire, belongs to cul- ture and can only receive cooked foods. The daughter is evidently pushed to her act by her stepmother (on whose ambiguous role I will later expand), but she immediate- ly feels she has committed a fault because she asks to "clean" the bowl-an act that constitutes a type of purification. The raw pow- der should have been placed in a calabash; the daughter clearly knows this since she proposes different kinds to her stepmother. The term white calabash (kjra pilu) designates one that is new and unused; it gives food a bitter taste, but it is possible to put raw baobab-leaf powder into it. The good calabash (k3r si) is one that already has been used for cooking. Later, when she re- tells her adventures to the old woman, the kind girl speaks of a piece of calabash (k3ra kebele), as will the unkind girl when speak- ing to her mother in the second part of the tale. If we compare the order in which these calabashes are enumer- ated at each occasion, we notice a significant difference: (a) enumeration by the kind girl to her stepmother: white calabash/good calabash (b) enumeration by the kind girl to the old women: piece of calabash/good calabash (c) enumeration by the unkind girl to her mother piece of calabash/good calabash/white calabash It is unnecessary to insist upon the symbolic association between a calabash and a woman because it already has been documented and is generalized throughout Africa.10 For our Dogon informants this enumeration is directly related to the three phases in a wom- an's life: the virgin girl under the age of puberty (white calabash), the married and fertile woman (good calabash), the old woman (piece of calabash).11 The order in which the calabashes are listed in the tale poses a problem since it does not conform to the logical sequence in all cases. Whether or not the tale-teller confused the sequence, it nevertheless is significant and must be explained. We could suppose that by listing the first two calabashes in their logical order, the kind girl evokes her own desire to pass from the virgin state to that of fertile woman. In her dialogue with the old</page><page sequence="5">172 Genevieve Calame-Griaule woman she is thinking of her stepmother who must become a piece of calabash while she herself should become a good calabash -it is precisely this passage that constitutes the nexus of the con- flict between them. The unkind girl mentions the three calabashes, but in an order inverse to the logical one-an act that conforms with the behavior of negative heroes in folktales, who act contrary to the norm. I will return to this notion of inversion. The girl proposes different kinds of water for washing the bowl; her purification efforts inside the family group fail, as do her propositions concerning the calabashes (logical suggestion, as it was apparently logical to wash the father's bowl in the house since it could not be taken out). The big water jar (lby) contains the water provisions for the house; two such jars can be found inside that part of the house-the women's domain, called "belly room" (d~a berd).12 These water jars must never leave the house, even in the case of divorce; they are tied to the ancestors who come to drink there at night and they are connected with family fertility since the term used to designate them is the same as that given to the envelope covering the fetus (amnios). These jars are in some ways the feminine equivalent of the father's bowl in the masculine realm. The daughter, who is not yet in possession of her own fer- tility, cannot use this essentially pure water in order to wash the symbolic incest. Two animal troughs are located in the courtyard: one is a hol- low stone for the chickens (similar to the ones in the sanctuary to the ancestors); the second is a trough for sheep made from a hol- lowed out tree. The water contained in these troughs is dirty and kept outside (in opposition to the water in the jar that is clean and found inside); still, it is too close to the house and "too cultural" for the girl to be able to use it: it is in the heart of the section in- habited by and belonging to domestic animals (chickens that peck in the village and sheep that graze in the environs). It is evident that when she enumerates the three types of water (from the most interior to the most exterior kind and from the cleanest to the dirtiest) the girl cedes to the irresistible force that will lead her away far into the bush. The Banu Pond actually exists; it is situated in the Gondo Plain, far from the region of Sanga (on the cliffs of Bandiagara) where events in the tale are supposed to take place. This pond has a bad reputation and is said to have provoked the death of a number of imprudent people. The very name Banu has become synonymous with death; a funeral song evokes it in the following manner:</page><page sequence="6">173 THE FATHER'S BOWL She left for Banu, she does not return Yasama left for the pond of Banu, does not return! Given these associations, it is clear that, for a Dogon auditor, when the stepmother sends the heroine to this pond, the older woman willfully sends the younger to her death. On the other hand, the good-bye formula she uses ("Go, wash and return") recalls the formula "go and return" (equivalent to "goodbye" in Dogon; it subtly underscores that this death will be provisional. The stepmother's character and behavior (so constant in all the versions of this type) appears to be charged with ambiguity. It is easy to see her as the aggressor or author of villainy (as Propp would have it) who provokes the departure of the innocent hero- ine. Seen from another point of view, the dialogue that she ex- changes with her stepdaughter (which will be repeated by the her- oine to the old woman and then again by the mother to provoke the departure of the second girl) has the regularity and fixity of initiation formulas. As a negative image of the mother, charged with responsibility for all mother-daughter conflicts (in some ver- sions, it is the real mother, undisguised, who plays this role), the stepmother is also the one who understands the need for sending the girl to the pond to undergo her initiatory death. On this level, we can see in this ambiguous character an image of the mother as she would appear to a child who must endure initiation; that is, the inexorable figure who chases her or him away from the family. Seen from this angle, the heroine's attitude is clarified: she knows she has committed an involuntary fault (desire to wash the bowl), she knows she must become a woman (the three calabashes), but she manifests a resistance to the idea of leaving home. She attaches herself (one could say clutches) onto the familiar objects in the "belly" room, which is also the mother (the good mother this time)-to the jar and to the troughs in the family space. Fear of leaving home and resentment toward the one who seems to chase her out appear to be normal reactions for a young neophyte at the moment when she must leave for initiation. The voyage begins. It takes place through the bush that lies be- yond the village frontiers and the fields that surround them. The passage from the world of man to the dangerous world of the bush, domain of the dead and pernicious powers, takes place on the horizontal axis; change of levels on the vertical, so frequent in initiatory quests, will only take place at the end of the voyage when the girl descends into the water depths. On her path, the</page><page sequence="7">174 Genevikve Calame-Griaule heroine undergoes tests that, in this version, are very reduced: en- counters and an exchange of polite greetings and responding to the question, "Where are you going?" This episode is, in fact, more important than it appears at first glance. Greetings are a highly valued form of speech among the Dogon; they constitute an in- dispensable prelude to all social communication, and respect for the rules governing the exchange of polite formulas is thought to have an influence on the successful functioning of the world.'3 As for the question: "Where are you going?," it is a fact that anyone who voyages in Dogon country will hear this very query posed by all passersby, not out of simple curiosity (which would be im- polite), but out of a need for certitude, out of the desire to leave nothing in the unknown. It is only when the walker or voyager has specified his destination that one will tell him, "Go and return." The kind girl's polite behavior proves her social maturity. One can also view the salutations in the tale as playing an initia- tory role since they open the way toward knowledge. The girl en- counters, in order of their appearance, herders of small livestock, goat keepers, and an old woman seated on the banks of the pond (at the end of the voyage). The herders-individuals frequently seen in the world of the bush and mediators between culture and nature-often intervene in the initiatory voyages in tales; they frequently offer the hero/or heroine milk, which is only partially consumed by the kind and completely consumed by the unkind. In this case, the milk is replaced by blessings whose beneficial ef- fects certainly are comparable. The herders probably symbolize the dead, the ancestors who serve as intermediaries between man and the god Amma, whose cult is very important in Dogon re- ligion. When they offer milk or good words to the protagonists, they in fact (by symbolic inversion) exchange libations and pray- ers (which, in daily life, man offers to the ancestors in return for their protection). Indeed, initiation is done under the sign of con- tinuity (the ancestors). The old woman in this story plays a much more unobtrusive role than she does in numerous other tales. She merely blesses the heroine's way, as did the herders, and warns her that "the water in Banu is not good." This woman, whose white hair-sign of wisdom and knowledge-is emphatically evoked several times (and, in the second quest, with injurious intentions), without doubt sym- bolizes the old woman who presides over excision ceremonies and who instructs the girls. She is also the one whose house is the re- union place for girls in the extended family, and she plays an im- portant role as mediator in amorous relationships and marriages.14</page><page sequence="8">175 THE FATHER'S BOWL One could possibly see a maternal image of goodwill in this old- woman-keeper-of-the-pond whose serenity is opposed to the malice of the stepmother. (Could the whiteness of her hair met- onymically recall the milk announced by the encounter with the herders?) Comparative study reveals that the heroine sometimes encounters her dead mother and not an unknown old woman in the initiatory realm. Before this positive feminine figure, the young girl manifests courage and determination; she says: "I will go at any rate in order to be saved" (the verbal form used for be- ing saved also signifies to heal). She understands that the time has come for her to undergo the definitive test: to return to the ma- ternal womb (the pond) in order to die and be reborn. Before plunging in the water, the heroine must wash her original fault (the desire for incest with her father). She begins washing the bowl by splashing water inside it with her hand (this gesture is ex- pressed in the text by use of an ideophone). In all likelihood, this motif must be interpreted as symbolizing excision; the presence of the old woman in combination with ablutions sufficiently justify this interpretation. Through this operation, a girl loses the mascu- line part of herself (the clitoris) and becomes a complete wom- an.15 She will thus be able to realize her fertility. The decisive episode in the tale is, in fact, the underwater de- scent and the sojourn in the realm of Nommo. This supernatural character, whose importance in Dogon religion and mythology has already been well documented,"1 is the master of water, of the verb, and of fertility. The form in which he manifests himself in this case is not specified; it is probably that of the crocodile who is one of Nommo's avatars. The presence of the eggs suggests that we are most certainly dealing with a female; Nommo is in fact androg- ynous, but femininity is "his" privileged aspect. Summoned by the sound of the water hitting the bowl, she looms up and drags the girl to the bottom of the maternal waters. The text does not state that Nommo "drinks" the girl (expression used when referring to someone who has drowned); it says that she "takes" her and "puts" her at the bottom of the water. In this situation, her de- scent thus represents a symbolic and temporary death. The task demanded of the heroine seems to pose no apparent difficulties, but its significance is clear: to watch over the eggs (the pregnancy) and to allow them to hatch (the birth). For the young girl, this task is a perfect occasion to prove that she is in- deed worthy of having progeny. She will now be able to return to her family and be reintegrated within society as a full-fledged adult.</page><page sequence="9">176 Genevikve Calame-Griaule Granting the reward is yet another pretext for testing the girl. It involves selecting one of two objects by a process of "inversed choices," that is, taking the small rather than the large one or the silent rather than the one who exclaims, "Take me," and so forth. The result obtained is inversely proportional to the choice. In this tale, the test is mitigated by the fact that Nommo indicates the choice to be made (she will propose the bad choice to the unkind girl). The onomatopoeia (buy buy and key key) express the sounds made when the granaries are touched; one granary reso- nates as if it were full and the other as if it were empty. It is the latter that contains the riches. In the world of initiation, making the good choice requires moderation and modesty, and such a choice especially implies that the initiate will from then on be able to read the language of appearances and seek out the hidden mean- ing of things. If the calabash symbolizes woman as a virtual container, the granaries, like the eggs, are the image of plenitude and fecundity. The eggs hatch in large numbers, the granaries open up to reveal innumerable riches. The birth symbolism evoked by this opening is evident and the Dogon are completely conscious of it, for they compare the granary to a pregnant woman. A cosmic aspect is superimposed onto the human birthing process: in the Dogon creation myth eggs and granaries are the privileged symbols of gestation ("the egg of the world") and creation (the world-arc also was a granary that contained all things)." By choosing these very symbols, the tale expresses an idea that is dear to the Dogon-that every woman who gives birth to a child reproduces the act of the Creator. The fertility granted to the heroine is essentially represented by the image of livestock, especially cows: for the Dogon, who pos- sess very little, livestock ("so much so that one does not know what to do with it") ideally represents the summum in wealth and power; furthermore, the cow is closely linked to maternity. The iron bowls raise several questions. They seem to echo the father's bowl which, once it has been washed in the pond, no longer fig- ures in the action. Indeed the father is mentioned a second time but only as master of the household ("It is time for me to return to my father's house"). Could the iron bowls represent a trans- formation of the wooden one? Iron is viewed as culturally superior to wood and as representing progress in the acquisition of tech- nical skills. To our knowledge, iron bowls do not exist among the Dogon, even as ritual objects. Their presence here could have cos-</page><page sequence="10">177 THE FATHER'S BOWL mic significance in correspondence with the earthen arc mentioned in the Dogon creation myth. In her last recommendation, Nommo entreats the girl to return home without looking back-a motif well known in folktales where it often is associated with sanctions. In the context of this story, it can be interpreted as follows: the innumerable riches that "follow" the heroine represent her fertility, thus her future prog- eny, which she cannot see. Not looking back constitutes an act of submission to the designs of God. Humanity is subjected to the passing of Time and cannot see into the future, which is "behind." The quest of the unkind girl needs few comments since it is de- veloped through the same episodes, though they bear a negative sign. We have already proposed that her mother's jealous reaction provokes the unkind girl's quest, which is intentional and has the goal of obtaining the same riches as the first quest. This situation is frequent in initiation tales; the negative hero or heroine pro- vokes a quest and forces his or her way in spite of unfavorable signals, but as is the case in the inverted choices test, the one who wants the most ends up obtaining the least. Similarly, the se- quence where the unkind girl enumerates the three calabashes in an illogical order foreshadows the negative tone of her quest, which is inverted (even though it appears to develop in symmetri- cal fashion) in relation to the first one. The girl's behavior during her voyage is easy to decipher and is similar to that of other negative heroes: impoliteness, lack of re- spect for rules and social norms, insolence toward elders. In Nom- mo's realm her behavior implies an infantile attitude: she breaks the eggs "in order to have fun" (whereas for the other heroine the idea of games had only entered into the action once the children were born). This childlike behavior is also characteristic of nega- tive heroes who are often older than their antagonists (although this is not the case in this tale). The negative protagonist is the one who never accedes to adult maturity and cannot be detached from his or her mother. The error the girl commits against fertility (breaking the eggs) is punished with gifts that symbolize sterility: the lean horse is opposed to the abundance of herds, the bowls filled with excrement contrast with the iron bowls and introduce the notion of death (rotting). In a version collected by Denise Paulme in 1935 (see note 4), the kind girl receives an abundance of cowrie shells, whereas the unkind girl is corporally punished: her intestines are replaced with sand held together by a potsherd and a cowrie shell;when the</page><page sequence="11">178 Genevieve Calame-Griaule latter is removed, the sand runs out and she dies. Cowrie shells are closely related to fertility: they are of aquatic origin; their form recalls the female sexual organs; their monetary value evokes the multiplication of riches; they are symbolically assimilated with fish eggs, fish being considered to be the most prolific of all animals. The sand running out of the intestines, on the other hand, recalls abortion (as do the broken eggs), continuous men- struation, the absence of fertility, and fecal incontinence-another infantile form of behavior characteristic of negative heroes. We therefore observe that all significant elements in the tale (calabash, water, baobab, cooking, eggs, granary, cattle) are associ- ated with female fertility. The only male element, the father's bowl, is envisaged in relation to the daughter; for her he consti- tutes an obstacle in the realization of her fecundity. Only the kind girl will succeed. If we attempt to understand the tale in its dynamic aspects, we notice that all the symbolic elements figuring in the beginning of each part reappear at the end under another form and are valued by a different sign. These transformations can be schematized as follows: stepmother A old woman - A Nommo (negative mother) (positive mother, (principle of initiator) fertility) father's bowl - father's bowl - iron bowls (soiled) (cleaned) calabashes -.- eggs g full granary (fertility) (pregnancy) (progeny) water jar % pond water - [water in husband's jar] (girl's own family (death and rebirth) (new family realm) realm) The only element in the table that is not mentioned in the tale is the water in the husband's jar. Even though this water is not mentioned, it constitutes the logical and definite end of the voy- age. In effect, when a young woman is introduced into her hus- band's family, her first ritual gesture is to draw water from the family pond and to fill the jar in the big house (ginna), consecrat-</page><page sequence="12">179 THE FATHER'S BOWL ing in this way her procreative role. It is not in her own family that a girl must accomplish this act (that is why her stepmother re- fuses to let her use the water in the jar); she must wait until she is married and pregnant with her first child. The heroine in the tale will return to her father's house only to leave it again in order to be married. A comparable table could be drawn up for the second quest, but all the elements in the right column would be assigned a nega- tive sign (empty granary, bowl filled with excrement). The only aspect that was initially positive (her attachment to her mother) turns out to be destructive in the end because it marks a refusal to accept the necessary rupture between the generations. It must also be pointed out that all transformations are situated at the pond- maternal womb, regenerative water, site of the death, and initia- tory resurrection of the heroine. The significance of the tale now seems to emerge clearly: Initial situation: The girl is in the family group like a white and virginal calabash that must become a good calabash; that is to say, she must fulfill her role as a woman in society. Fault: In order to accede to adult female status and thus realize her own fertility, she must (a) surmount the temptation of incest with her father (the baobab powder in the father's bowl) and (b) resolve the rivalry with her mother (the stepmother, the wife of the father, the bad mother) and more generally with the women of the superior generation who must become broken calabashes when girls become women. Departure: The conflict, experienced as a fault by the older women and by the young girl herself, can only be cleansed through initiation, which implies breaking ties with the real family and re- turning to the maternal womb through symbolic death. Voyage: The girl's quest leads her to death and to rebirth into a new life. The return to the maternal womb is effected through several stages demarcated by encounters that evoke different images: ancestors (the herders) and maternal (the old woman, ap- peased mother who has renounced femininity; the pond water; Nommo, the cosmic principle of fertility). Tests: The heroine proves that she possesses all the qualities necessary for living in society. Among other things, her very pres- ence favors fecundity (the hatching of the eggs); she is now nubile. Resurrection and return: She is reborn into a new life (result of the water) and returns home with riches (symbols of her future fertility).</page><page sequence="13">180 Genevieve Calame-Griaule Unkind girl's quest: She proves, through her perfectly inverse behavior, that she cannot accede to the status of an adult woman. She is condemned to sterility, synonymous with death. We see that this scheme corresponds exactly to that of initiation -to which I referred at the beginning of this study. In addition to its other implications, this scheme highlights the profound signifi- cance of this ritual institution in Dogon society. To what extent then do the symbols in the tale correspond to ritual reality? Initiation ceremonies among the Dogon are less spectacular than they are in other African societies. Girls are excised by an old woman; they are given instructions until they marry; one part (secret, interior instructions concerning female physiology) is taught by the mother and the other part (exterior instructions concerning social rules and behavior with one's husband and in- laws) is given by the old woman whose house is the girls' reunion place. The initiatory voyage in our tale, therefore, does not so much make reference to real rites (even though certain elements are recognizable) as refer to that quest for fecundity that charac- terizes the Dogon woman from infancy. Conclusions Other versions of AT 480 in Africa as well as in Europe could be interpreted along the same lines as the Dogon tale analyzed in these pages. In fact, all begin with conflict over a material object that symbolizes (a) the girl's puberty (the heroine's bloodied dis- taff in Grimm's "Frau Holle"), (b) the mother's aging (the moth- er's calabash is broken by her daughter in numerous versions), (c) the parents' sexual relationship (the father's bowl in our Dogon version or the mother's pestle broken by the daughter in the ver- sions from Upper Volta mentioned in note 6). The fundamental problem posed by these tales centers on the succession of generations and the conflicts it engenders. The girl's quest for fertility represents a menace to her seniors who must in turn renounce their own and cede their place to her. The situation is complicated by the temptation of incest. The goal of the initia- tory voyage undertaken by the girl is twofold: it prepares her for the social role she will have to play and it facilitates succession by reestablishing continuity where there had been rupture. Appendix: Text of "The Father's Bowl" Tales! A girl, her mother was dead. Her mother's cowife tells her</page><page sequence="14">181 THE FATHER'S BOWL to grind baobab [leaves] . She says: "Good!" She ground the bao- bab [leaves]. "What shall I put them in?" Her stepmother didn't answer. Since she didn't answer, she asked, "Do I put [the pow- der] in a white calabash?" "No." "Do I put it in a good cala- bash?" "No." "What shall I put it in?" "Put it in your father's platter." "Good." She put [the powder] in her father's platter. "Should I wash this platter?" "Yes." "With what kind of water shall I wash it?" She didn't answer. "Shall I wash it with the water in the water jar? " "No." "With the chicken's water?" "No." "With the sheep's water?" "No." "Where will I wash it?" "Go to Banu, wash, and return." "Good." Walking on the path to Banu, walking, walking, the first thing she encountered very close by were shepherds. They met one another. She asked them to show her the way to Banu. The herd- ers told her, "Greetings from the bush! When you will have con- tinued on the path on which you are, go this way. When you will have gone that way, you will encounter some people; the path to Banu is there." They showed her to way to Banu. She said: "Good." Again, she encountered goat keepers, saluted them. They exchanged greetings with her. She asked them the way to Banu. They said: "It is this one; may God show you to way to Banu. Go and come back [i.e., goodbye]." "Good." The girl went there. Now she approaches Banu. Behold, an old woman with a completely white head is sitting. She went toward the old woman with the completely white head who was sitting. She greeted the old woman who said, "Thank you. Where are you going?" "I am going to Banu. I crushed baobab [leaves] for my mother. I asked if I should grind, she said: 'Grind!' I asked her in what container I should put [the powder]. 'Should I put it in a broken calabash?' She said no. 'Should I put it in a good cala- bash?' She said no. 'What shall I put it in?' She said to put it in my father's bowl. Me, when I put it in this bowl, I asked if I should wash it with water from the water jar. She said no. 'With the water from the chicken's trough?' She said no. 'With the sheep's water?' She said no. She said, 'Go wash at Banu and return.' That is how I left." The old woman said, "The water of Banu is not good." "Ah, well, I'll go at any rate in order to be saved." "Good. Since Banu is there, come closer." She came closer, the water did segeu segeu [sound of water agitated when cleaning the interior of a con- tainer] . Nommo took her, brought her to the water bottom. She told her, "Since I am going into a village, keep my eggs." She was watching the eggs while Nommo was gone to this village; before</page><page sequence="15">182 Genevieve Calame-Griaule her return all the children joyfully hatched and began playing. Nommo returned and found the girl; Nommo looked with all of his eyes [in disbelief]. "It is time that I leave for my father's house." "You are leav- ing?" "Yes." She showed her the granaries. "When you will have touched all the granaries, you will not touch the one that says buy buy; the one that says key key, when you have touched it, leave without turning back to look behind you." "Good." The girl went to the granary, touched it, and didn't turn back in order to look. She left and without stopping entered her house. When she looked, cows, goats, sheep, iron bowls, an innumerable amount of things had followed her and came behind her. Thus, having sat down and having turned her head, she saw these innumerable things, herds that came from far away and returned [because there were too many]. In the house, it was extremely full. Her stepmother said, "So the daughter of my cowife obtained something! What a disaster!" She told her daughter to also leave. "Good." This woman's daughter also ground baobab [leaves]. When she finished, "What shall I put the powder in?" Her mother didn't answer. "Shall I put it in a piece of calabash?" "No." "Shall I put it in a good calabash?" "No." "In a white calabash?" "No." "What shall I put it in?" "In your father's bowl." "Good." She put [the powder] in her father's bowl. "Mother, shall I wash it with the water from the water jar?" "No." "With water from the sheep's trough?" "No." "With water from the chicken trough?" "No." "With what water shall I wash it?" "Go wash it at Banu and return." "Good." Then, walking, walking, walking on the road to Banu, behold she met some cattle herders. She went to meet them. The cattle herders asked her where she was going. She told them: "You have asked me where I am going? What business is it of yours?" "May God not show you the way to the place where you are going!" Then she left. Walking, walking, walking, she encountered goat keepers. She went to meet them. They asked her where she was going. "Is it necessary for you to ask me where I am going?" "May your eyes not show you the place where you are going." Thus, they spoke. Then she came upon the old woman. She found her sitting near the Banu water. She did not greet the old woman. This one asked her where she was going. "Woman with the completely white head who asks me where I am going, what will you do with it [my answer] ?" "May God not show you the place where you are go- ing!" "Good." She went to Banu, did segeu segeu with her platter.</page><page sequence="16">183 THE FATHER'S BOWL Nommo took her and brought her to the water bottom. She told her, "I am going to a village, keep my eggs." "Good." She watched over the eggs after Nommo had left. "This can be much fun!" Paf! "My pestle works very well!" Paf! Breaking, breaking, all the eggs were finished except for two that remained [intact]. Nommo re- turned, asked, "Where are my eggs?" "I broke them all while play- ing." "When you leave, go to those granaries that are aligned, leave alone the one that says key key, touch the one that says buy buy and leave. Don't turn back to look behind." "Good." When she returned and once [she was] seated in their house, she turned to look behind her-a lean horse, a platter with excrement, all sorts of filth followed her and came behind her. The tale answered. It remains quiet. NOTES 1. This article is an abridged and reedited version of "La Cale- basse brisee...," Cabiers de Litte'rature Orale, 1 (1975), 23-66. 2. Warren E.

A version of the same tale was collected by Denise Paulme in 1935; the two tales are very similar to one another. 5. Cf.

In versions of the same tale collected in Upper Volta (Gene- vieve Calame-Griaule, "Le Conte des deux filles en Haute-Volta" in Recherche, Pedagogie et Culture, 20 [1975], 2-11), the step- mother's pestle is broken by the stepdaughter. The act of pound- ing with a pestle in a mortar is widely recognized in West Africa as</page><page sequence="17">184 Genevieve Calame-Griaule symbolic of sexual intercourse. Thus, by breaking the pestle, the girl in essence tries to destroy the mother-father relationship. 7. Marcel Griaule, Dieu d'Eau, 2nd ed. (Paris: Fayard, 1966), p. 23. 8.

The old woman is not scorned; she can even play a very important role in society, but what is broken in her is her fertility. 12.
