<plain_text><page sequence="1">RITUAL IN BRANCH XVII OF THE ROMAN DE RENVART (MORT ET PROCESSION RENART): A KEY TO A CARNIVALESQUE READING OF THE TEXTS? A succession of rituals structures Branch xvII of the Roman de Renart,' which narrates the death and burial of the fox, Renart. In addition to the religious rituals of confession, eulogy, sermon, and solemn procession that mark the funeral rites for the fox and the committal of his body to the earth, rituals of justice and, most important, rituals of play also feature in this branch. Special significance may be accorded to these ludic rituals because they may furnish the modern reader with a critical apparatus for approaching a reading of the Roman de Renart as a whole. This bold attribution of such importance to just one of the twenty-six branches of this text written by different authors, most of them anonymous, between I 174 and 12502 may be justified by the relationships of the branches of the Roman to each other. Jean Scheidegger uses the term 'polygraphique' to acknowledge the many hands that have contributed to the composition of individual branches of the Renart cycle.3 'Heteroglossia', the term developed by the Russian Formalist, Bakhtin, could equally well be used to describe the different voices from different branches of the cycle that resonate through the narrative, but come together to encourage a reading of the text that is itself flexible enough to acknowledge this inherent diversity. The conscious, self-referential nature of the branches of the Renart cycle has been readily recognized by critics who have referred to 'reecriture', 'lecture intertextuelle',4 'auto-regeneration',5 and 'oeuvre r6petitive',6 and Jean Dufournet has carried out a detailed study of the debt owed by Branch xvII to earlier ones. So if it is accepted that individual branches are sometimes enmeshed with other tales in the cycle, the possibility may also be admitted that the critical reading encouraged by one branch may extend to a reading of other parts of the whole text. It will be demonstrated here how the rituals of Branch xvII promote a carnivalesque reading, an approach itself bound up with cycles and rituals outlined briefly below, and how a tale of death and burial encourages a critical approach that stresses laughter and rebirth. The main season for the medieval carnival was the period between Christmas and Easter, a time marking the transition from the old year to the new, and therefore a time linked with thoughts of death and rebirth. Further evidence of the carnival's association with the life cycle can be found in its origins in pagan agricultural The numbering of branches is that established by Ernest Martin in his edition of the text, Le Roman de Renart, 3 vols (Strasbourg: Triibner, 1882- 887). All line references are to this edition of the text. 2 Lucien Foulet dates Branches I, II, in, iv, va, vi, vii, viII, ix, x, xi, XII, xiv, xv, xvI, and xvn to between 1174 and 1205 (Le Roman de Renard (Paris: Champion, 1968), p. i 8).

WILLIAMS festivals,7 and indeed festivities carnivalesque in nature occurred outside the main season to commemorate saints' days or important stages in the agricultural year. Carnival festivities were marked by two particular types of ritual, one closely associated with the Church's role in such feast days, and the other part of the secular community's celebration of liberation and restoration. The Church explicitly incorporated rituals of inversion into its involvement with carnival. On Holy Innocents' Day (28 December), for example, the choirboys would usurp the roles of the older clergy and a boy bishop would be elected for the day. The Feast of Fools also depended on the playful inversion of Church hierarchy and the ritual would be marked by the celebration of a mock Mass or the hearing of a mock confession, whilst in the celebration of the Feast of the Ass a donkey would be led around the church and the service interrupted by braying from the clergy.8 The justification for this type of inverted ritual comes from the words of the Magnificat: 'He hath put down the mighty from their seats and hath exalted the humble.'9 Such inversion is not to be understood as subversion, however, as this type of ritual presupposes that the participants acknowledge the true non-inverted status quo. The same is true of the rituals of popular justice used by a community to chastise those within their number perceived to have transgressed the rules guaranteeing the smooth functioning of community life. 'Charivari' is the term used to describe such rituals, which involved the victim being taken from his house and paraded through the streets seated backwards on an ass and accompanied by loud, discordant music.'0 The victim is thus treated as a scapegoat, singled out from the collective as an individual incarnating antisocial behaviour; but once his fault has been publicly aired, he is accepted back into the community, cleansed of his sin by the humiliation he has endured. Finally, on a more general note, the carnival was a time to acknowledge the appetites of the body and to fulfil them, indulging in food and drink before the abstinence of the Lenten period. The action of Branch xvII of the Roman de Renart will be shown to share these fundamental characteristics of medieval carnival celebration and, because of this, its carnivalesque nature may be seen as a basis for a reading of the cycle as a whole. The branch opens in typical fashion with Renart venturing forth from his castle into the new spring air, urging his horse to carry him to a nearby Cistercian abbey, where he ravages the poultry stocks and partially castrates the unfortunate monk who dares to try to save the hens (11. I-60). This is a very ordinary prologue, but one that is disturbed by Renart's subsequent meeting with the hare, Couard. This notoriously cowardly animal has succeeded in overpowering a furrier who tried to attack him in the woods. He managed this by terrifying the peasant into submission and now carries him bound, dangling from a stake held over his own shoulder, to 7 Mikhail M.

The usual inversion created by the anthropomorphic presentation of the animals is accentuated here by the specific characters involved: the hare and the furrier. The prey has become predator and takes delight in speculating with Renart on the gruesome methods that might be used to dispatch the troublesome human (11. 6I-I49). The reader is already being alerted to the fact that he is entering a monde a 1'envers by the double indignity suffered by the furrier in being trapped by his own quarry, and being carried upside-down to his trial." When fox and hare arrive at court they find that all the dignitaries are assembled, dressed in their best furs (11. I62-64), to mark the feast day of dame Coupee, a hen treacherously murdered by Renart himself in Branch I. The action of this branch is therefore to take place on a holiday, when celebration and ritual are to be expected. Indeed, peace and community spirit appear to be the order of the day as Renart is warmly welcomed and sits in a privileged seat next to the king (11. 264-66) 'qui moult chier l'avoit' (1. 175). The ritual of the courtroom is strictly observed as Noble agrees that the captive peasant should be allowed to present character witnesses.12 On arrival they testify to the good nature of their fellow human by relating to the court how, on the occasion of winning an egg, the furrier divided it into thirteen pieces and shared it amongst his friends (11. I50-261). This short episode is typical of the way in which ritual is used in the Roman de Renart. The animals take great care to ensure that procedures are closely followed, whether in the court of justice or in the church,'3 so the inversion is to be found not in what they do but in what they are. In addition to this, the observance of the ritual is frequently interrupted by violence (as when in Branch II Ysengrin allows himself to be tonsured with scalding water to gain admission into Renart's eel-eating monastic order), by the surreal (as in the case just related of the divided egg), or by the frankly obscene, as will be seen later in this branch. Following the acquittal of the peasant, the court refreshes itself with a feast and then devotes itself to playing draughts and dice, emphasizing the playful context of the branch. The conflict between Renart and Ysengrin the wolf has been the central dynamic of the Renart cycle up to this point, and here their conflict is transferred to the ludic sphere, as they play out their hostilities on a chessboard (11. 275-312). Previously Renart has encouraged Ysengrin into situations where he has been horribly mutilated and the wolf has had his whole masculine identity removed both psychologically (Renart has conducted an adulterous affair with the she-wolf Hersent and has raped her in front of Ysengrin (Branch II)), and physically (Ysengrin has lost all his genitalia as a result of falling victim to Renart's tricks (Branch ib)). It is not surprising then that the wolf should seek revenge. What is 1 'Cet 6pisode ne prend son sens que de proclamer que tout ira ici de travers, qu'il s'agit d'un jeu qui rend l'impossible cr6dible' (Scheidegger, p. 286). 12 This is the legal procedure known as compurgation, whereby the accused could call on a group of relatives or neighbours, usually twelve in number, to swear oaths in support of his good character: see David M. Walker, The Oxford Companion to Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 264, for a full definition. A reference to this procedure is also found in Le Jeu d'Adam, ed. by Wolfgang van Emden (Edinburgh: Societe Rencesvals British Branch, I996), 11. 35 -52: 'Nen ai ami ne nul veisin I qui me trai[e] del plait a fin.' 13 For a detailed investigation of the authenticity of the legal proceedings in the Roman de Renart, see Jean Graven, Le Proces criminel du Roman de Renart: Etude du droit criminelfeodal au XIIeme siicle (Geneva: Librairie de l'Universit6, Georg et Cie., I950). Flinn comments on how the author of Branch xvii shares the concern for precision in the depiction of religious ritual of the authors of Branches I, xnI, and xiv (Flinn, p. 104). 956</page><page sequence="4">ALISON J. WILLIAMS surprising is that in this game of wit and intellect Renart should lose to his dull- witted partner. This defeat is in fact just as much part of the atmosphere of inversion of this branch as is the capture of the furrier by the hare. Having gambled away all his money Renart foolishly stakes his own masculinity on one last game. When the fox loses, Ysengrin delightedly takes this literally and stakes Renart to the chessboard by driving a large nail through the part of the fox's anatomy that has caused the wolf so much humiliation. Alerted by the fox's laments, Queen Fiere rushes to administer aid to her one-time rapist (Branch Ia) and bigamous husband (Branch xi), all thoughts of their previous morally dubious encounters brushed aside in a courtly exchange in the face of death (11. 313-68). Fearing that he is not much longer for this world, Renart calls on Bernart, donkey, and archbishop, to hear his confession (11. 369-440). This is not the first time that Renart has sought to unburden his soul. He has made confession in Branches i, v, VI, vII, and viii. Jean Subrenat has made a study of the confessions, and points out their literary function as serving to 'rappeler au public des 6venements passes et, par la meme occasion creer un facteur d'unite entre les diverses branches du roman'.'4 Although Renart acknowledges that repentance and atonement are the correct rituals to follow at this time, he does not conform to the spirit required. The only past deeds he is prepared to consider are the rape of Hersent, which he claims brought her 'lieesce et bien' (1. 390), and his marriage to Fiere, which, he argues, did his own wife, Hermeline, no harm (11. 391-95). Indeed, he considers himself guilty of one sin only: curing Noble of his illness (Branch x). He ignores Bernart's reprimand and openly states that if by some remote chance he should recover from his wound, he will withdraw his declaration of repentance. Renart delivers the type of burlesque confession that was part of the rituals of inversion used by the Church to mark carnival time, but he also shows himself to be an opportunist when it comes to ritual: if it is useful to him he will follow its form but not its spirit, he grants such ritual only the temporary hold over his life that carnival celebrations had in the normal rituals of medieval life. When Renart finally appears dead, the court is overwhelmed with grief. Why should this be? After all, this fox has caused most of the other animals serious physical harm and they have sought to execute him for his antisocial behaviour in Branches I and vI, so why, when he is apparently dead, are they now so sad? One simple explanation offers itself: they are just following the rules of this ritual, which demand mourning at the time of the burial of the deceased. The playful nature of the branch has already been established with the trial of the peasant, and the board games with which the animal barons have amused themselves, so now they are abiding by the rules of this new game. There are, however, more complex views that might explain their reaction, both drawing on the carnival tradition and addressing the role of the fox within the whole cycle. The victim of carnival rituals of humiliation was treated as a moral scapegoat: he became a symbol of the sin he had committed.'5 In the animal community of Noble's court Renart incarnates every conceivable sin. This is not to say that the other animals are pure of heart (indeed they too are guilty of deceit and self-interest), but however bad they have 14 'Les Confessions de Renart', in Epopie animale, fable, fabliau: Actes du colloque de la Societe Internationale Renardienne, ed. by Gabriel Bianciotto and Michel Salvat (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, I984), pp. 625-40 (p. 627). 15 For a fuller discussion of the victim of the charivari, see Rey-Flaud, passim. 957</page><page sequence="5">Ritual in the 'Roman de Renart' been, Renart has been worse. The carnival scapegoat is temporarily ejected from the community, but is then reintegrated once his transgression has been recognized. But death is more than a temporary exclusion: with Renart dead he can no longer be the one who is blamed for all that is wrong with their community, so where will the court put all its moral rubbish now? This argument is valid in sociological terms, but a certain wariness is to be recommended in taking too psychological an approach to a community of talking beasts. So a more fruitful line of enquiry is to question what the death of Renart means for the cycle of the Roman, and to consider the reader's responses to the fox's imminent absence. Despite his villainous deeds, Renart is the spirit of laughter in the cycle, often introducing farce and slapstick, along with many other kinds of more subtle humour, into the narrative. Admittedly this humour is, by modern standards, usually excessively violent and often very dark, just like the humour of thefabliaux, or to quote a more contemporary example, like the humour of cartoons or comic strips. Kenneth Varty addresses this parallel, emphasizing how no matter what happens to the victims they do not really suffer.16 They share the amazing elasticity of form seen in Tom and Jerry, when both cat and mouse suffer such dreadful physical distortions but are, in the next frame, able to spring back into shape. If Renart's disruptive presence is removed, will the text also lose its humour? Can the reader even conceive of a continuation of the text without the energy of Renart as its catalyst? Scheidegger sees Renart as an organic part of the text, arguing that 'il ne saurait etre question d'executer le goupil, puisqu'il entretient un rapport fondamental avec l'art du roman' (p. 276), whilst J. R. Simpson refers to 'an ambivalence towards both the death of the central figure and the closing of the cycle. The more the event becomes unthinkable, the more the narrative becomes fascinated by it'.17 Just as the carnival scapegoat becomes his own sin, Renart comes to symbolize the text, not simply because he is the central figure but because his own nature shares some of the character of the text: he narrates his own story in his eloquent pleadings at his trials, he relives past episodes in his confessions, synthesizing elements of the different branches within his own narratives and, most important, he proves himself capable of self-regeneration. The sequence of rituals that Renart's death triggers in the branch continues with his body being placed on the bier and Grimbert the badger calling for the vigil to be sung (11. 519-644). Bernart, as archbishop, leads the ceremony, but is aided in reading nine lessons and singing the appropriate responses and verses by several other animals, including not only those animals previously harmed by Renart but also some, such as Pelet the rat, who have been murdered by Renart in previous branches (Pelet is murdered in Branch Ia), giving further evidence of the cartoon- like spirit of laughter and literal renewal in which Renart's acts of violence take place. Again, due concern is given to the correct procedure, the only interruption here being Brun the bear breaking wind after reading the fourth verse (11. 609- i o). Once the vigil is complete, the court abruptly switches back to the holiday mood of the beginning of the branch. 16 'L'Economie des Romans de Renart', in A la Recherche du 'Roman de Renart' ed. by Kenneth Varty, 2 vols (New Alyth: Lochee, 1988-91), I, 13-49 (p- 47). 17 Animal Body, Literary Corpus: The Old French 'Roman de Renart'(Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1996), p. 185. 958</page><page sequence="6">ALISON J. WILLIAMS Having fulfilled one of the solemn rituals marking Renart's death, they turn to the playful ritual of the game of 'plantees' (11. 645-786). The rules of this game are somewhat obscure, but it seems to involve one animal placing himself in the centre of the floor with one limb outstretched. An opponent then tries to topple the animal by hitting the outstretched limb as hard as possible. If he succeeds he then takes the place of his opponent and is himself attacked in a similar way. This interlude is strange enough for it to merit further investigation. Scheidegger recognizes its importance within the branch and within the entire cycle: 'Le jeu formalise la violence, en un rituel ofu le vainqueur prend la place du vaincu pour etre a son tour vaincu. [.. .] Lejeu des plantees apparait comme la mise en abyme du contenu de la branche, si ce n'est du roman entier' (p. 287). The game can be interpreted as an example of the rough games typical of carnival ritual, and is a further example of the conflicts that have dominated earlier branches being revisited through play in this branch. It is also reminiscent of children's games such as Ring-a-ring-a-roses, which transfers fear of death from the plague to a playful context, thus providing those confronted with the spectre of death a chance to draw its sting by acting it out and, most important, by being able to get up and experience the ritual over and over again. The game of 'plantees' may thus show the animals acting out their own mortality in an atmosphere of happy indulgence (the game is accompanied by refreshments of wine and beer depending on the individual tastes of the animals). Games are in themselves important rituals, as Johan Huizinga emphasizes in his influential work, Homo Ludens.'8 Huizinga identifies aspects of play in the rituals which structure human lives and on which societies are built: The arena, the card-table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis court, the court of justice, etc. are all in form and function playgrounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain. All are temporary worlds within the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of an act apart. (pp. 28-29) This idea of a temporary world and actions apart is also to be found in the rituals of carnival, celebrated in a time apart (at holiday time, outside normal life) and permitting actions that would usually be condemned. So the game of 'plantees' is just as important a ritual in the branch as the vigil and sermon that accompany the fox to his grave. When morning comes, the animals prepare to bury Renart. Bernart delivers a sermon (11. 840-912) that begins conventionally enough, with exhortations to lead a good life. The first indication that this sermon is going to have more in common with the sermons joyeux of the carnival tradition than with a sober reflection on the transience of life is the fact that Bernart uses Renart not as a negative example of how to live but as a model to be imitated. He claims: Renart qui la vie a finee Si a en son temps demenee Vie de martyr et d'apostre: continuing: I1 a este sanz felonie Et sanz malice et sanz orgueil. (11. 855, 864) 18 Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture, trans. by R. F. C. Hull (London: Temple Smith, I970), first published in Dutch in 1938. 959</page><page sequence="7">Ritual in the 'Roman de Renart' This of the arch deceiver, rapist, mutilator and murderer? If such sentiments already signal the interruption of the ritual by incongruous elements, then Bernart's frank discussion of Renart's sexual rapaciousness simply compounds this fusion of appropriate ritual with inappropriate subject-matter. Bernart begins this section of his sermon with exuberant repetition of the verb 'foutre', before urging the congregation to make full use of the equipment with which God has endowed them. He concludes by claiming that the penitence for those guilty of carnal mis- demeanours will be to eat meat every day in a glorious prolonging of the carnival spirit, living out the afterlife in Heavenly promiscuity, whilst those who abstain will suffer the torments of a frigidly celibate Hell. There follow prayers, the reading of the epistle, a gospel reading peppered with references to Renart's illicit liaisons with Hersent and Fiere, and finally Bernart sings Mass before the animals are given roles to play in the burial of the fox (11. 913-1073). As this ritual cycle threatens to come to a close, it is revealed that Renart has not really been dead, but has been in a prolonged swoon (1. 1076). As Brun the bear prepares to fill in the grave, the fox opens his eyes, is horrified at the prospect of being buried alive, and wonders whether he has not been bewitched when he sees the court assembled for his burial. He performs a literally death- defying leap and seizes Chantecler the cockerel in his jaws before racing away across the fields, returning to one of the earliest parts of the whole cycle where, in Branch in, Renart lures Chantecler into singing with his eyes closed, leaving himself unguarded against the wily fox. Renart not only then embodies the laughter of carnival, its rough humour, its physical appetites, but also shares its regenerative nature, as he renews his own identity. The feigned death and resurrection of the fox is a popular subject for iconographical representations of the fox's wily nature and finds its origins in the Bestiary tradition dating back to the Physiologus of the second century BC. Kenneth Varty has done extensive research into fifteen sources found in British, Flemish, German, Italian, and Spanish manuscripts and Church architectural features.19 Images of the fox's burial and resurrection both pre-date and post-date Branch xvII, which appears to have directly influenced only three of the examples,20 the Bestiary tradition and the general theme of the world-upside-down are credited with inspiring the others. So, in adding this tale of the fox's death and rebirth to the cycle, the author of Branch xvii is developing an already well-established tradition, and he deliberately exploits the tradition of the Bestiary fox in the latter part of the branch, for this first resurrection leads to a frenetic cycle of death and rebirth. Renart is forced to free Chantecler when a massive, starving hound is let loose on him, and he is then pursued and captured by the outraged court, led by the swift Tardif the snail (11. I I48-218). The group that had mourned him so deeply now threatens him with execution, but Renart appeals to their sense of justice by demanding the right to be tried in court, arguing that Chantecler had masterminded a plan to bury him alive. The court decides that Chantecler and Renart should settle the matter in single combat (11. I219-97). Renart suffers serious injury from '9 'The Death and Resurrection of Reynard in Mediaeval Literature and Art', Nottingham French Studies, I0 (1966), 70-93. 20 Varty cites the carvings in Strasbourg Cathedral, now destroyed, but dated to c. I250, the frieze at Marienhafe, again now destroyed, and a drawing in the Flemish manuscript MS Bodley 264, dated to between 1339-1344 ('The Death and Resurrection', p. 90). 96o</page><page sequence="8">ALISON J. WILLIAMS Chantecler's beak, losing an ear and an eye, and so feigns death to avoid any further harm (11. 1298-399). Renart is apparently dead for a second time, and his body is left in a ditch. He is being true to his vulpine nature here, as foxes do indeed feign death in order to attract their prey.21 This is a characteristic of the fox much exploited by the Bestiary tradition, which used it as evidence of the fox's diabolical nature: The fox [... .] is a clever, cheating animal. If it is hungry and cannot find anything to eat, it rolls in red earth, so that it seems as if it is spotted with blood, and lies on the ground holding its breath, so that it is hardly breathing. The birds see that it is not breathing, and is lying there spotted with blood with its tongue hanging out, and think it is dead. They fly down to perch on it, and it seizes them and devours them. The fox is the symbol of the devil, who appears to be dead to all living things until he has them by the throat and punishes them.22 This is exactly what happens to the crow couple, Rohart and Brune, who decide to attack Renart in the ditch. In his second resurrection Renart bites offRohart's leg and flees to his fortress, Maupertuis, where he is reunited with his wife and sons (11. 1400-73). Once again justice is sought, this time by the crows, and Noble decides that Renart will again be threatened with execution (11. I474-529). Grimbert, Renart's cousin and staunch supporter, suggests that he, accompanied by Hubert the kite and Tardif the snail, should deliver a message to Maupertuis summoning Renart to appear at court (11. 1530-53). Grimbert alone has the courage to enter Renart's lair, where he and the fox family devise their own narrative of the fox's death: his third. Renart instructs Grimbert to tell the king that the crows killed him and that he is buried close to his lair. Fortuitously a peasant named Renart has recently died, and his tomb, along with its inscription bearing his name, is conveniently situated close to Maupertuis. Renart thus passes on his public identity to a dead man, and Hermeline and Rovel, one of his sons, lead Noble's envoys to what they take to be Renart's final resting-place (11. i555-645). The emotional rollercoaster on which the animal barons have been riding in their reactions to Renart's death and resurrection continues to soar and plummet as Noble once again laments the passing of one of his most treasured vassals: Et dist dolanz et esperdu 'Par grant pechie avons perdu Le meilleur baron que j'avoie' (1. I677). The branch ends with apparent closure as the version found in most manuscripts concludes: Ici luec de Renart vous les La vie et la procession. Ci fine de Renart le non. (1. i686) On a first reading, this implies that the cycle is at an end, but then the reader is drawn to focus on the word 'non'. It is the name that is over, the name inscribed on 21 Varty reproduces four stills taken in 196I by the Russian naturalist, F. Rossif, which show a fox feigning death to catch a carrion crow (Varty, Reynard the Fox. A Study of the Fox in Medieval English Art (Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1967), p. 91). 22 Bestiay (English version of MS Bodley 764), trans. by Richard Barber (Woodbridge: Boydell, 1993), p. 65. 96I</page><page sequence="9">Ritual in the 'Roman de Renart' the tombstone commemorating the life of the dead peasant, not the fox safely hidden in Maupertuis, and certainly not his identity: that spirit of laughter and disruption he embodies. This interpretation is supported by the words of comfort to be found at the end of the version of this branch contained in the M manuscript (Turin Misc. 5 I): De Renart lerons le gorpill Qui chantecler mist a essil Mes ia Renart ne finera Tant con cest siecle durera Car touz jorz sera il renart Et par con engin engignart.23 The reader is thus reassured that the story will go on, that more episodes will be added to the cycle, and a warning is given of the continuing existence of'renardie': the type of trickery practised by the fox. The actual events of the accelerated cycle of fortune and decline that Renart undergoes after rising from the grave may be of limited interest, and indeed Simpson is of the opinion that these 'stock situations of the fox narrative [...] are played out in rather a tired way, as if the text's batteries were running down' (pp. I83-84). But it is the repetitive nature of these episodes that makes them important. Renart's threefold cheating of death shows that he, like the text bearing his name, is self-generating, self-referential (when running away with Chantecler in his mouth he remembers how on a previous occasion Chantecler tricked him into speaking with his mouth full and so made him lose his prize (11. 1124-28)), and cyclical (he keeps coming round again, he cannot be killed, for to do so would be to break the chain of the text). He incarnates the renewing spirit of carnival, with its rough humour, its physical appetites, and its inversion of ritual. In Branch xvII it is the rituals accompanying that most sombre of occasions, death and burial, which Renart interrupts. I noted earlier how inappropriate words or content cause the rituals to veer away from their usual spirit,24 but Renart does something more than this: if all rituals are in some way akin to a game, then Renart is the ultimate cheat, defined by Huizinga as being the one who 'pretends to be playing the game, and on the face of it, still acknowledges the magic circle' (Huizinga, p. 30). He confesses, he lies quietly in the grave, but then arises, not un-dead, but all too alive, breaking the rule that should confine him to non-being. Huizinga, having acknowledged that the spoilsport is usually treated with hatred, goes on to explain how this disruptive character may ultimately have a positive function: It sometimes happens, however, that the spoilsports in their turn make a new community with rules of their own. The outlaw, the revolutionary, the cabbalist or member of a secret society, indeed heretics of all kinds are of a highly associative if not sociable disposition, and a certain element of play is prominent in all their doings. In the case of Renart, the community he makes is a community of the carnivalesque, which along with its rituals of violence and humiliation also contains the playful element that is the key to reading the whole of the Roman de Renart. To appreciate the truly comic nature of the text, its violence, its amoral sexuality, and its dynamic 23 Le Roman de Renart, ed. by Ernest Martin, 3 vols (Strasbourg: Triibner, 1887), II: Les Variantes, p. 590. 24 See also Jean Dufournet: 'Le r6cit suit un moule connu, puis soudain s'en ecarte' (p. 352). 962</page><page sequence="10">ALISON J.

The Renart cycle is a text produced by many hands and containing many voices, but Branch xvII may be seen as a microcosm of all these texts, and it is this that makes it possible to see it as the key to understanding many other parts of the cycle of branches. It recalls the text's own past: some of the narratives it contains (such as the confession and the sermon) retell the action of earlier branches; past conflicts between the animals are represented on the chessboard and in the game of 'plantees'; the concern for correct procedure in religious ritual recalls the care taken by Tibert and Primaut in singing Vespers in Branches xnI and xiv; after his first resurrection Renart scampers around the material of other branches, literally taking the reader round in circles as other parts of the cycle are revisited. In the Roman de Renart individual branches may be selected for attention, but the reader also needs to be aware of the rich texture of references that has developed as a result of its cumulative composition, and is deliberately exploited by the authors of the various branches. It is in fact a textual community, made up of individual branches in many of which lives a carnivalesque spirit, most evident in the rituals of the texts, whether they are religious, judicial, inverted, humiliating, or simply playful.
