<plain_text><page sequence="1">AITo'XXcov' Ovos ALEXANDER H. KRAPPE H ECATAEUS of Abdera,l a younger contemporary of Alexander the Great, reported on a strange Apollon cult, flourishing in what to him seemed the far north and attributed to the "Hyperboreans," that is, the Celts living along the shores of the North Sea between the mouths of the Meuse and the Elbe.2 There was settled, in a certain island, which our author calls "Helixoia," a people that worshiped the god in a round temple adorned with many ex-votos. He adds that from of old there had been inter- course between these "Hyperboreans" and the Greeks, so that what he says is really nothing new to his readers. The latter statement is certainly true. Pindar, in his tenth Pytbian ode, describes the god's rejoicing at the leaps of ithyphal- lic3 donkeys, which are being sacrificed to him among the Hyperboreans. Callim- achus,4 who can hardly have drawn on Hecataeus for this particular, twice refers to this ass sacrifice; so does Simmias of Rhodes.5 I Diod. Sic. ii. 47; Frag. 5 (FHG, III, 387); Aelian Hist. anim. xi. 1. On Hecataeus cf. RE, XIV, 2750 ff. 2 The identiflcation of these "Hyperboreans" with the Celts of northwestern Europe goes back to Posido- nius of Apamea (cf. Frag. 90 [FHG, III, 2901). It has been accepted, in modern times, by such authorities as H. d'Arbois de Jubainville (Les premiers habitants de l'Europe [Paris, 1889-94], I, 238 ff.; II, 311 ff. and 393), Karl Mii]lenhoff (Deutsche Altertumskunde [Berlin, 1887-19001, II, 296), and Henri Hubert (The Celts [London, 1934J, I, 6 and 25). a This interpretation is questioned by Miss L. Lawler, CP, XLI (1946), 155 ff. She does not deny, however, that the word 6ptv (1. 36), when applied to animals, often enough has a sexual implication. In fact, it is the exact equivalent of the German Uppig- keit, which appears to have an analogous etymology. 4 Frags. 187 and 188 (ed. 0. Schneider). 5 Apud Antoninus Liberalis Metam. 20 (ed. Mar- tini). On Simmias of Rhodes cf. RE, II. Reihe, V, 155 ff. These texts would appear to establish two sets of facts: (1) There was an Apollon cult among the Hyperboreans of the North Sea coast and (2) the sacrificial animal of the deity was the donkey. So the question arises: Are these two facts recon- cilable? One might observe, in the first place, that Hecataeus does not say a word about the ass sacrifice; but no valid conclusion can be drawn from this silence, since Diodorus Siculus has preserved but an excerpt of his source and may not have included this feature, even if it did occur in Hecataeus. Far more serious is another objection. The donkey is definitely not an animal of northern and north-central Europe. John Hunter states that "in the reign of Queen Elizabeth the breed was extinct in this kingdom, and to this day in Norway and Sweden, an ass is never seen but as a curiosity in the stables of the great."6 From his own childhood the writer re- members a campaign waged by charitable souls in Belgium and the adjacent Rhine- land urging the abolition of the use of dogs as draft animals (for carts and other light vehicles) and the introduction of donkeys, virtually unknown in that region, in their place. There is no Teutonic or Celtic word denoting this useful animal: Ir. assan (whence OE assa &gt; E. ass), W. asyn, Corn. asen, Bret. azen, Goth. asilus (&gt; G. Esel), all are derived from Lat. asinus. Hence the bewilderment of Wilamowitz: "Es bleibt ratselhaft, wie man ein Tier, das 6 Sir Richard Owen (ed.), Essays and Observations in Natural History, Anatomy, Physiology, Psychology, and Geology (by John Hunter), Being His Posthumous Papers on Those Subjects (London, 1861), I, 59.

KRAPPE der Hellene nicht opferte, und das im Norden nicht heimisch ist, als Opfer der frominen Bewohner des apollinischen Gar- tens einfuhren konnte."7 This negative result is fully borne out by Aristotle, who, speaking of the Celts beyond Spain (i.e., in Gaul), states that the climate is so cold there that the don- key cannot be born in those lands.8 This means that in the fourth century before our era the ass was not yet completely acclimatized in the countries north of the Alps and the Pyrenees.9 There remains only one solution of the problem: Pindar, Callimachus, and Sim- mias confused two different Apollon cults, one credited to the Hyperboreans and in which the donkey was conspicuous only by its absence, the other, flourishing in some region more congenial to it and in which it was, accordingly, the sacrificial animal of the god. This conclusion is not so desperate as it may seem-: in fact, it is confirmed by Simmias, who tells the following tale: In Mesopotamia, near Babylon, lived a wealthy and god-fearing man named Kleinis, owner of herds of cattle, donkeys, and sheep. He was a particularly ardent worshiper of Apollon and Artemis, and frequently accom- panied these deities to the temple of Apollon among the Hyperboreans, where he witnessed the sacrifice of donkeys to the god.'" The story goes on to relate that, having once returned to Babylon, Kleinis decided to adopt the Hyperborean custom but was told peremptorily by the god to desist and to continue sacrificing goats, sheep, and cattle, for donkeys were welcome only when coming from the Hyperboreans. 7 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Pindaros (Ber- lin, 1922), p. 128. 8 De gen. anim. ii. 8. Even the Basque word asto, "ass," is derived from the Latin. 9 Cf. also H. d'Arbois de Jubainville, Cours de littirature celtique, XII (1902), 55 f. 10 An.ton. Lib. Metam. 20. Now the modes of transportation in antiquity were not such as to make it an easy matter for a man residing in Babylon to make a sort of pilgrimage to the North Sea coast, there to witness the cult acts performed in honor of an exotic deity. The site of this Apolline ass sacrifice must therefore have been considerably closer to Babylon if any credit is to be given to the narrative. Wilamowitz' understandable bewilder- ment at the report of Hecataeus was in- creased by the fact that the Greeks were not in the habit of sacrificing donkeys and that this useful animal plays a very negli- gible part in the Olympian religion. It is thus inadmissible to claim, with some, that Hecataeus (or his authority) may have transferred to the Hyperboreans a custom current in Greece.1" This fact is of greater importance than would seem at first blush. As is well known, the Hellenic Olympians are by no means purely Indo-European creations. Behind most of them lurk pre-Hellenic and Anatolian divinities, whom the in- vaders from the north found firmly estab- lished in continental Greece and in the islands and whom they thought it con- venient to identify or fuse with the Olym- pians. So we ask: Is there any trace, in Aegean lands, of some connection of Apol- lon with the donkey? We shall see that there is indeed. There is, in the first place, 'Air6XXwv KtXXaZos,12 whose cult flourished in Mysia, where he had a famous shrine in the town of Killa. In the same region, Strabo (xiii. 1. 62) attests the existence of a 11 Cf., e.g., Boeckh (ad CI G, I, 807. 14): "non Graeci Hyperboreos fecissent Apollini asinorum hecatomben offerentes nisi in Graecia quoque asini mactati Apollini essent." The conclusion is faulty because, after all, the Greeks may very well have observed ass sacriflces in the Near and Middle East and, by analogy, have ascribed the custom to the Hyperboreans. 12 Cf.

At the shrine of Killa there also was a KLXXov ,4v-,a which was linked up, we do not know on what authority, with the name of the legendary charioteer of Pelops. All this precludes, of course, the possibility of the god's being called after the town, and we inquire next into the meaning of the name. The clue is furnished, as so often, by the lexicographers. Thus Pollux (vii. 56) in- forms us that KLXXov roov 6V Olt AwtplETS Kal KtXXaKT7pa rOv Ov-X4aTv.13 As has been re- peatedly suggested, this name, KLXXos, points to the movability of the donkey's ears, just as the cEtOToV-yLs (presumably a wagtail species) is also named KLXXovpos in Hesychius.'4 To this another rather sig- nificant feature must be added. The KX- Xov Avx.,a cannot very well be separated from the Av-qAfeZa 2iXr7vovi in the land of the Hebrews'5 and in Pergamon.'6 They would seem to favor the view that we are deal- ing with a "dying god" of the Attis and Adonis type, whose passing was presum- ably commemorated by annual mourning rituals. However this may be, the cult of 'A7roXXwv KtXXaZos is clearly pre-Hellenic"7 and points to Asia Minor as its diffusion center. It is, however, by no means an isolated phenomenon. In the town of Priapos, on the shores of the Propontis (in the Troad) there flourished a cult of 'Aro6XXwv IIptairaZos, that is, of an Apollon assimilated to the god Priapos, whose cult center (or one of them) was the town of Lampsakos. As a matter of fact, there was a tradition according to which Priapos, driven away from Lampsakos by the " Cf. also Hesychius, s.vv.

As in so many other cases (inter alia, the goat sacrifice to Dionysos), it was ex- plained on the basis of some enmity of old standing between the god and the animal. These stories, rather amusing though of doubtful morality, contribute nothing to the main problem and may conveniently be read in the classical sources.20 Of greater significance is another tradi- tion telling how Priapos engaged in a con- test with the donkey of Dionysos on the grave question of which of the two, the donkey or Priapos, could boast of a more perfect organ of generation. According to one group of authorities, Priapos lost and, in a fit of anger, slew his rival.2' According to others, the god won; but the donkey, in compensation, as it were, was put among the stars of the nightly sky.22 These stories are significant in that they show the close association of the god with the ass and, at the same time, intimate quite clearly the reason of this association. Even more sig- nificant is a passage of Afranius,23 in which Priapos appears to defend himself against the charge that he is the son of a jackass. The son of a jackass, of course, is a jackass himself-an inference confirmed by the law, first formulated by Salomon 18 Serv. ad Verg.

KRAPPE Reinach, that a deity's sacrificial animal and etiological stories telling of an enmity between the god and the animal point to the god's beast-shape in the theriomorphic stage of religious evolution. On this show- ing, Priapos, and with him 'Aro6XXwv IHIptaraZos, would originally have been ass-shaped divinities. This conclusion is corroborated, how- ever indirectly, by the following consid- eration. Priapos of Lampsakos was the patron saint of truck-gardeners. Now it is a well-known fact, attested by Boccaccio, among others, that the skull of an ass set up on a pole in a wheat field is a potent charm against blight. In a modern parallel we are told that at Mourzac, in central Africa, the people set up the head of an ass in their gardens to avert the evil eye from their crops.24 Western Anatolia knew still another such divinity, to which we must now turn, the famous Marsyas. Marsyas is variously described as a Silenus or Satyr living at Kelainai (Phrygia). The story current about him ran as follows: Athena, having invented the double flute, threw it away when she noticed that playing this instru- ment detracted from her beauty. Marsyas picked it up and, proud of his talents as a flute-player, challenged Apollon to a con- test. The god vanquished him by his play on the cithara and, in a fit of anger, pun- ished Marsyas by flaying him alive.25 The first part of this story may be safely neglected. As Salomon Reinach26 clearly saw, one tradition attributed the 24 Cf. Notes and Queries, VII (1st ser., 1853), 496; 0. Jahn, Ber. d. Seichs. Gesellsch. d. Wissensch. zu Leipzig, philos.-philol.

Our tale is merely an attempt to harmonize the two versions. Of far greater importance is the second part of the narrative: the barbarous pun- ishment meted out to the unfortunate Silenus; for in historical times the hide of Marsyas, hung up in a grotto, the source of the Marsyas River,27 was shown at Kelainai as proof visible of the truth of the ancient tradition.28 It was even fabled to tremble at the sound of the double flute.29 Since the Sileni were generally thought to be beast-shaped,30 it follows that the hide in question must have been that of some quadruped. This Marsyas was, however, more than an ordinary Satyr. Pausanias (x. 30. 9) leaves no doubt that with the Phrygians he was a god: The Phrygians of Kelainai claim that the river which traverses their town in former times was the famous flute-player Marsyas, to whom they ascribe the invention of the tunes sacred to the mother of the gods; they add that in times of old they repulsed an invasion of the Galatae thanks to the help of Marsyas, who turned away the barbarians by the floods of his river and by the sound of his flute. Local tradition closely accords with the report of the Greek traveler. Marsyas, it was claimed, had been wept not only by the nymphs and by his own disciple, named Olympos; Apollon himself was fabled to have been seized with remorse and to have broken his lyre.3' From Marsyas' blood the Satyrs were said to have sprung, while the river was supposed 27 On the identity of this river with the modern Dineir-Su, a tributary of the Menderez (the ancient Maiandros), cf.

In fact, we know that his tomb was shown at Pes- sinous, a center of the cult of Kybele;33 and there are still other features that link him with the great Anatolian goddess.34 Marsyas would thus appear to have been an ancient Phrygian divinity, who, because he was classed with the Sileni, must have been beast-shaped. Now the typical animals associated with this class of demons were the donkey and the mule; when represented in human shape they are generally mounted on mules. Whence it has been concluded, rightly, that, prior to their anthropomorphic stage, they were themselves donkeys or mules. As a matter of fact, the fragment of a painting found at Mycenae represents a procession of ass- headed demons, no doubt the lineal ances- tors of the Sileni.35 Since religious tradi- tion is most conservative, one will easily understand why in the famous Dionysiac procession of King Ptolemy Philadelphus, described by Athenaeus (v. 196 ff.), sev- eral hundred Sileni and Satyrs, com- panions of Dionysos, are riding on don- keys or mules, though horses would evi- 32 Ovid Metam. vi. 383 if.; Myth.

Artemidorus (ii. 12) inter- prets the appearance of a donkey in a dream as of good augury, since the animal is sacred to the Mco-ros bat'Aixwv 2A7v6s.38 Nor is this all. The tradition of Ke- lainai repeatedly introduces the well- known King Midas39 into the legendary cycle of Marsyas. Midas is made to act as umpire in the musical contest of Apollon and Marsyas.Y4 A Phrygian himself, he naturally sides with his compatriot and protests against the adverse judgment. The Marsyas River was fabled to have sprung from a source which Dionysos had struck of old as a favor to his friend Midas.4' Both Midas and Marsyas are Satyrs42 and are connected with the cult of Kybele at Pessinous.43 On the other hand, the famous story of the donkey-ears of Midas sufficiently reveals the true na- ture of the mythical king: he was an ass- shaped divinity. This fact is brought out even more strongly by a significant passage of Lyco- phron's Cassandra (vss. 1397-1408), where Midas, on his expedition against Thrace, puts on donkey's ears," i.e., as- 36 Reinach, op. cit., IV, 38.

The Phrygians, as is well known, were newcomers in Asia Minor: their original home had been Macedonia, where Herod- otus (viii. 138) mentions the wonderful rose gardens of Midas, situated at the foot of Mount Bermion, close to the spring called Inna ("the Mule"). Whether Midas was thought to pasture on these roses is not stated; but one is reminded of the denouement of Apuleius' Golden Ass, where the hero, transformed into a don- key, must eat roses to recover his human shape. Since the subject of this novel is known to be of Balkan origin, it is fair to infer that the author or authors are likely to have known the rose gardens of Midas; they were doubtless also familiar with the widely spread tale of the donkey's ears of the old Phrygian king. So they introduced the feature that, to recover his pristine shape, the hero must adopt the diet of Midas.45 From these data one fact would seem to be reasonably certain: The Phrygians worshiped, in ancient times, a divinity imaged in the form of an ass. We are not told what animals were sacrificed to him; but the myth of his death, preserved in the tradition current about Marsyas and the well-known observation that the former animal shape of a god or goddess is frequently indicated by his or her favorite sacrificial animal would make it plausible that, like the Hyperborean Apollon of Pindar, this Anatolian deity rejoiced in the sacrifice of donkeys. In the myth, it is true, Marsyas is him- self sacrificed-by Apollon and, as it were, to Apollon. This, in turn, would lead us to infer the existence of an ass-shaped Apol- lon, that is, it would bring us back to such 45 On Midas as a donkey, ancestor of the old Phrygian kings, cf. also 0. Keller, Die antike Tierwelt, I, 260. figures as 'Aro6XXwv KtXXacos and 'ArobXXwv Hptawracos, both equally of Anatolian origin. In other words, Anatolia, in addi- tion to a "mouse Apollon,"46 also knew an "ass Apollon." It is inadvisable to attribute excessive weight to the notice of Clement of Alexan- dria,47 according to which the Arcadians believed their Apollon Nomios a son of Silenus. But the tradition may very well point to an ancient animal form of the god. Of greater significance is the rap- prochement of Marsyas with the Thracian Maron (Mapcov). Whatever one may think of Welcker's hypothesis, which assumed a relationship between his name and that of Marsyas,48 it cannot be doubted that Maron is a Thracian Silenus, the patron divinity of the cities of Ismaros and Maro- neia. According to the Odyssey (ix. 197 ff.), he was a priest of Apollon and appears to have been, originally, horse-shaped: the coins of Maroneia still show a running horse. If we recall that the horse is rela- tively a latecomer (of which more anon), the successor of the humble ass, the con- clusion may seem warranted that this Thracian Silenus, too, was originally a donkey. If it is further remembered that the assimilation of priests to their god is a common feature in the history of cults,49 the fact that Maron is a priest of Apollon is perhaps no mere coincidence. However this may be, we still have to account for the strange story of the con- test of the two ass-gods and the slaughter of the one by the other. From the fact that 46 Cf. my article in CP, XXXVI (1941), 133-41. 47 Protr., p. 24; cf. Sam Wide, Lakonische Kulte (Leipzig, 1893), p. 255. 48 Nachtr. zu der Schrift iuber die Aeschyl. Tril.

Against this view it was pointed out that the story is unquestionably much older than the stage of civilization which such an interpretation would seem to postulate.50 The true clue is furnished, I believe, by a variant of the tale preserved by Plutarch.5" There the contest is divided into two acts: in the first, Apollon plays the cithara, Marsyas the flute, and the latter comes out victorious. In the second act Apollon accompanies his music with his song, a feat which Marsyas is obvious- ly unable to imitate. So Apollon is de- clared victor, rather unfairly, it must be owned, and then proceeds to flay his unlucky rival. But the very unfairness of the proposition would tend to raise doubts about the originality of this feature; the very emphasis, however, which is laid on the vocal part of the contest, seems to be an ancient feature: it brings home the ill- fame of the donkey's bray.52 The Greeks had a proverb: vOvos Xivpas aKO'vw, denot- ing a complete lout, and Suidas quotes the saying 'Ovos -rpos aVXO'v. In German the expression, "Er versteht davon so viel wie der Esel vom Harfenspiel," first given wider currency by Martin Luther, who thus characterized the theological knowl- edge of Thomas de Vio of Gaeta (in 1518), points in the same direction.53 For an identical reason Aesop makes the ass judge the contest between cuckoo and nightingale, while more modern fables have the donkey enter a contest with the '?

Now, Apollon being the god of harmony, the donkey's bray must have made Marsyas appear as the Hellenic god's natural antagonist. This explanation, however plausible it may seem, fails to take into account- nay, is in contradiction with-Apollon's own asinine nature, which is certainly much older than the rules of harmony and 'AlroXXcv Movorlqykrtqs. So the real and pri- mary cause of the antagonism of the two divinities must be sought elsewhere. We have pointed out, above, the in- trinsic impossibility of donkey sacrifices among the Hyperboreans of Hecataeus of Abdera: these Hyperboreans, frequently identified with the historical Celts, lived in a country in which donkeys are not found. But it is pertinent to ask whether an identification made at the time of Hecataeus and of Posidonius of Apamea is necessarily correct also for an older pe- riod, a question all the more justified be- cause the term is much older than the time of Alexander the Great.55 Here it is well to remember that geographic and ethno- graphic nomenclature is likely to be ex- tremely elastic, filling its content with wider and even wholly different meanings as human knowledge advances. Thus the term "Indian" in the English language 54 Cf., e.g., J. K. Schuller and Th. Steinhausen, Aus der Walachei (Hermannstadt, 1852), p. 3. One of the better-known variants of the theme is a little poem by Frederick of Prussia, contained in a letter to Voltaire under date of October 24, 1775: "Un beau jour certain ane, en paissant dans les bois, Entendit pr6luder la tendre Philomole, Qui c6l6brait l'amour dans la saison nouvelle.

KRAPPE still reflects a time when Europeans (start- ing with Columbus) believed that the newly discovered American continent was a part of Asia. In this manner the term Hyperboreioi could have been applied to the Celts only after the Greeks had be- come somewhat familiar with the geogra- phy and ethnography of northern Gaul, which happened prior to Herodotus but after the founding of Massilia, about 600 B.C. Before that time the term doubt- less denoted what the various etymologies of the word56 would seem to indicate, some people or peoples living north of the Balkan range, regions such as present-day Bulgaria, Serbia, the Banat, etc.,57 and in which the donkey is still one of the most important and most appreciated of do- mestic animals-a region, furthermore, from which the Phrygians are known to have invaded the great Anatolian penin- sula.58 On this showing, the myth of the divine antagonism would become clear enough: both Apollon and Marsyas were divine donkeys, the latter worshiped by the in- digenous Anatolian population, with a cult center at Ke]ainai, the former by a tribe of invaders hailing from southeast- ern Europe, which subjugated the natives and substituted their own divinity for that of the conquered. In other words, the vic- tory of Apollon over Marsyas reflects the victory of the Apollon worshipers over the Marsyas worshipers. If this view is to be accepted, two other conditions must be fulfilled, to wit: (1) there must be evidence of Apollon's north- ern origin and (2) Marsyas must be shown to belong to a more ancient stratum of population. 56 RE, XVII, 258 if. 57 Cf.

The writer believes that evidence for the migration of the Apollon cult from the German North Sea coast through central Europe into the Balkans has been brought forward in a previous study of his.59 Since the donkey was unknown in northern Ger- many, its association with the god can only have occurred farther south, in the lands of the Danube; and it is indeed likely that the original donkey-sacrificing Hyperboreans were some people settled in that region. This conclusion, namely, that the origi- nal ass-sacrificing Hyperboreans are Da- nubians, receives a certain amount of cor- roboration from three sources. The Vergil commentator Servius (ad Aen. iv. 146) states: "Pictique Agathyrsi populi sunt Scythiae, colentes Apollinem hyperbo- reum cuius logia, id est responsa, ferun- tur." With this text should be compared a fragment of Apollodorus,60 who mentions donkey sacrifices among the Scythians. Since the animal did not thrive in Scythia any more than it does in southern Russia today, it is likely that the donkey-sacri- ficing Scythians were the Agathyrsi, who were settled in what is today southern Rumania and Hungary. The second source, though late-in fact, medieval- cannot for this reason be altogether neg- lected. The oldest Bohemian chronicler, Cosmas of Prague (i. 11), in speaking of the heathen period of his native land, re- ports that donkey sacrifices were offered to the ancient gods by some Slavic tribe of northwestern Bohemia. On the one hand, it is difficult to discern the motive which could have induced the worthy canon to invent such a custom. On the other, if one considers the universal con- servatism in matters religious, we may be dealing with a survival from a custom practiced by the pre-Slavonic inhabitants 59 Cf.

Finally, it appears that the words ovos and asinus have both been taken from a Thraco-Illyrian vocab- ulary.6- As for Marsyas, we shall see presently that his "territory" is by no means lim- ited to Asia Minor. In the first place, the name Mapabas (var. Mao-bas), denoting springs and rivers, is also known in Syria,62 where it was the name of a valley or region in Commagene.63 Nor was it, in Asia Minor, limited to the domain of the Phrygians. Herodotus (v. 118 f.) knows of a Marsyas River in Caria ;64 and the Masyes or Masses River in Lydia65 is but a variant of the Marsyas.66 At all events, it is clear that the name of Marsyas is not Phrygian but belongs to a stratum of Anatolian populations which was not confined to Phrygia, or even to Asia Minor, but encroached on northern Syria. Thus Sir William Ramsay67 was evidently right in thinking that the name belongs to the tongue of a pre-Phrygian people, and he suggested the Hittites.68 However this may be, it is significant that in Palestine, as in Phrygia, the don- key is connected with springs. Thus Ana, son of Zibeon, finds hot springs in the desert while pasturing his father's don- keys.69 When Samson drops the donkey's jaw with which he had slain a thousand Philistines, a spring gushes forth.70 Plu- "I E.

Tacitus72 corroborates the same tradition: "Nihil aeque [Iudaeos in deserto] quam inopia aquae fatigabat, iamque haud procul exitio totis campis procubuerant, cum grex asinorum agres- tium e pastu in rupem nemore opacam concessit. Secutus Moyses coniectura her- bidi soli largas aquarum venas aperit .... effigiem animalis, quo monstrante er- rorem sitimque depulerant, penetrali sacravere." Among the Thraco-Phrygians, both in Europe and in Asia Minor, Midas, the legendary ancestor of the old Phrygian dynasty, whose original ass-shape was pointed out above, was a Queligeist, as is clearly seen from the ir-?y? Mlaa73 and the MUlouV Kp'V-.74 One may go even further and say that the Sileni as a group are inti- mately connected with springs.75 Thus in the Laconian town of Pyrrhichos, Silenus was said to have caused a spring to gush forth in the market place.76 The relation between the donkey and water is thus fairly well established. As for the reasons which are adduced by various scholars to explain this connection and which may be found summarized in Professor Cook's essay," they are more than dubious. It seems certain that the legends just reviewed cannot very well be 71 Symp. iv. 5; Quae8t. conviv. v. 2. 10. 72 Hist. v. 3-4 (ed. Fisher); cf. Tertullian Apologet. 16. 73 E.

The most famous of these is probably the story of Pegasos (from ?rq-y', "spring") and Hippokrene;78 but similar traditions are widely current also in northern Europe.79 It would seem obvious that all these tales, whether the hero be a donkey or a horse, must find their explanation in one and the same fact or set of facts. In the opinion of the writer, we are dealing with the ability of animals to sense the proximity of water, a matter of common knowledge in North Africa as well as in the Near and Middle East, where the camel is known to have this sort of su- persense. Whether or no the Hittites introduced the cult of an ass-shaped divinity from Anatolia into Syria, it is a fact that there are many traces of such a cult in Palestine. There is, first, the old clan name of Hamor, "jackass," localized in Sichem. Then there is the age-old fable, the darling of the anti-Semites of antiquity, to the effect that the Jews worshiped a donkey in the Temple of Jerusalem.80 Such 78 Cf. 0.

In this case the donkey worship was presumably peculiar to some Canaanitish tribe or tribes subjugated or displaced by the invading Hebrews. The well-known tradition about the conten- tion of two of Jacob's sons with the people of Sichem8' would seem to corroborate this conjecture. Then there is the curious injunction: "But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck."82 This is as much as to say that, while the first-born of other domestic animals, such as bulls and sheep, are to be sacrificed to Jahveh, the ass is not acceptable as an offering: a lamb must be offered, instead, or else the ass destroyed. This may mean that the ass was simply an "unclean" ani- mal (Lev. 11: 7) and as such not ac- ceptable as a sacrifice; but it may also mean that the animal was obnoxious to Jahveh because it was sacred to some rival deity of whom Jahveh was "jealous." This conjecture receives a certain amount of confirmation from the fact that the wild ass was eaten by the Arabs with a religious intention, since its flesh was for- bidden to Christian converts by St. Simeon Stylites, while among the Har- raneans it was forbidden food, like the swine and the dog.83 The data collected84 will be found to 81 Genesis, chap. 34. 82 Exod. 34:20; cf. also F.

What and where are they?" What my sire sup- posed, And where yon cloud conceals them ! "Till they 'scape And scramble down to Leda, as a swan, Europa, as a bull! why not as-ass To somebody?" True enough, no myth has come down in which a high god in the form of an ass seduced a fair one, though it cannot, of course, be gainsaid that such a myth may have existed and, for all we know, may have been quite as popular as the famous story of Leda and the divine swan. At all events, the Phrygian tradition of the ass- shaped Midas, ancestor of a royal dy- nasty, would make this almost certain. What did most effectively prevent the cultivation of such myths in classical Greece is-there can be little doubt-the all-important fact that the fortunes of the modest donkey went down in the world after the days when that world was young, and the reasons for this adversity are not far to seek.85 The horse, as is well known, is a com- parative newcomer in the domestic econ- omy of the Near and the Middle East, where it appears to have been introduced, by invaders from the North, in the course of the second millennium of the pre-Chris- tian era.86 Its introduction brought on a revolution comparable only to the one we have witnessed in the present century as a result of the invention of the motorcar.

A few examples must suffice to make this clear. In Vedic India (where the horse does not thrive because of the tropical climate) the ass was the mount of the Asvins or Aryan Dioscuri, to whom the animal was sacred.88 Donkeys draw the chariot of the Twin Gods when they make their appear- ance in the morning twilight,89 and with such a team they win a chariot race.90 At the time of Absalom's ill-starred rebellion, David's warriors were still mounted on mules, not on horses.9" After his defeat Absalom sought safety in flight mounted on a mule,92 sure proof that horses were as yet too rare and hence too expensive even for a king's son. When David sent Solomon to Gihon to be anointed, he had him mount on his own, David's, mule.93 Nor was the part played by the donkey in war altogether negligible. When Darius attacked the Scythians, his contingent of asses proved most effective in routing the enemy's cavalry.94 According to Eratos- thenes,95 in the great battle of the gods against the Giants, the Satyrs are mounted on asses, whose braying frightens the enemy and wins the battle. Pausanias (x. 18. 4) states that the Ambrakiots dedi- cated a bronze ass in gratitude for a night victory over the Molossians, in which the foe had been routed by a timely bray.

KRAPPE Marsyas' flute could have frightened the Galatae, as Pausanias (x. 30. 9) reports; but the braying of donkeys may well have terrified the Galatian cavalry. In the Rig- Veda (i. 29. 5) the ass likewise throws the enemy into confusion by its discordant voice. According to Aelian,96 the Sarako- roi, a (probably) Iranian tribe, used don- keys as steeds in war and dedicated to Ares such specimens as were distinguished by a particularly loud bray. Much the same thing is reported by Strabo (xv. 2. 14) of the Carmanians; and he adds that the use of donkeys in war is due to the absence of horses, a statement unques- tionably correct, since horses do not thrive in the hot climate of that region (Gedrosia), and that asses are sacrificed by them to Ares, their god of war. Indra himself has a swift-footed donkey, and one of the epithets of Vikramaditya was Gardhar bha-ru&amp;pa, "he in the form of an ass."97 The coming of the horse completely changed this state of things. The donkey was relegated to a subordinate position. In the Iliad (xi. 558 ff.) he already ap- pears as a symbol of stolidity and ob- stinacy. Again, while the horse soon came to be the mount of the proud conqueror (cf. Alexander's Bucephalus), the donkey logically assumed the role of the meek and peaceful animal par excellence, the mount 96 De nat. anim. xii. 34. 97 W.
