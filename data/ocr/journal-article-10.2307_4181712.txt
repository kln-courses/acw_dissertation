<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hesiodic and Milesian Cosmogonies -II' MICHAEL C. STOKES 3. The order of events in cosmogony (a) Hesiod, Theogony I I 6ff. A necessary preliminary to the analysis of this cosmogony is the dis- cussion of a difficult point of interpretation and textual criticism. The point concerns Theogony i i 8-9, which with the immediate context appear in the MSS. as follows: 'H -rot [Lsv 7rpW'statoc Xiocv yeve-r, ouTOap 7rvrot 116 Fat' eU'piCaTepVO, 7t&amp;vrCov f8oc &amp;ap?0X aoClL 117 'OoVaTcov, O'L gxouat xcXpvi Vw6evtro 'O)X,irou 118 T&amp;p'rxpci ' X p6evptc Luzx XOv64 CUpUOUeb4, 119 B8' "EpO... There were already doubts in antiquity about the authenticity of i I 8 and i I 9, and these doubts have been taken up by many of the moderns. There are obviously four logical possibilities in the matter; either (i) one accepts both lines, or (2) one rejects both lines, or (3) one rejects i18 alone, or (4.) one rejects 1i9 alone. The fourth and last named view is represented by only one possible ancient source, to wit Chalcidiusz, is adopted in no recent work, and will therefore be ignored here: the justification for this high-handedness is that the question of most importance for present purposes is whether Tartarus is or is not a separate entity in this cosmogonical passage, and it is obvious that if solution (4) be adopted then Tartarus is not even mentioned. If both lines are to be rejected (solution (2) above), then the same conclusion follows. If one adopts solution (3), then Tartarus is, ,tuX6 xOov6q, manifestly subordinate to Earth, and, whatever the force of the particle -' of I I9, should not be taken as a separate entity on a par with Earth and Eros. It is probable that the same conclusion should be drawn from solution (i), the acceptance of both the disputed lines; but not all critics would necessarily agree with this view, and it may therefore be useful to give the question another airing. The indirect tradition for the text is instructive, but not probative.3 Schwabl4 has recently pointed out that the older ancient authorities differ from the younger, except their followers, not certainly in text, but either in text or in interpretation. Acusi- laus, Platos and Zeno of Citium6 may either have adopted the rendering of Schoe- I I regret that W.K.C.

What is certain is that if, as is also just possible, the earlier ancient citations were from a text containing 1 I 9 but not ii 8, then these authors subordinated Tartarus to earth as I have above. The authors who treat the passage as containing four original beings, Chaos, Earth, Tartarus and Eros,3 all belong to the Christian era, and it is a reasonable hypothesis that they did so in error, finding both the disputed lines in their text, and being so misled by the Homeric formula ot gXouat xvkp1n V46eV-7O 'O)Utou as to take Tartara/Tartarus4 as a separate entity. The idea that Tartarus made a fourth was probably responsible for the athetization of ii 8, as being on this interpretation somewhat inappropriate.5 The Homeric formula however is not adequate reason for ending a sentence at the end of i i 86. Hesiod indeed makes use of Homeric formulae, as Hoekstra7 has shown, as formulae, and not by 'literary' borrowing, but Hoekstra does not prove him incapable of treating the formula as he wished; the genesis of Boeotian epic is obscure in detail. Sundry arguments brought against I i8 may be briefly dismissed. Scherling8 thought that the omissions of the line from the text by Plato and other writers were conclusive against it. But even if they did omit the line, it may have been through Plato's limited interest in the passage, and later aping of Plato, that these omissions took place.9 Kirk and Raven add that the line is inorganic; but this does nothing to prove that it is un- authentic, only that it is not impossible so to regard it. In any case it is doubtful whether it is truly inorganic, if by that is meant that it is unnecessary to the sense. That the line cosmogony, but that does nothing to show that he did not translate the lines as we have them in the manner of Schoemann. I Opuscula Academica II, p. 66 n. 7, and elsewhere, Die Hesiodische Theogonie (Berlin 1868) pp. 86ff.; the same view was taken by Van Lennep, Hesiodi Theog. (Amsterdam 1843), and to the names cited by Schwabl, op. cit. (p. i n. 4) p. 30 should also be added that of Mair in his translation (Oxford 1908). 2 Plato's interest in this passage is mainly in Eros, and Zeno is concerned in the fragments with some extremely forced analogies between Hesiod's teaching and his own. 3 Cornutus, Plutarch, Pausanias, Damascius, and others; see Rzach, ed. maior (Leipzig 1902)ad loc. 4 The Mss. of Plutarch have the unmetrical Tacp'ap6v r'. It is difficult to tell which form is the older; no help is given by the examples in Kiihner-Blass Vol. I pp. 499f; it is not clear whether the plural is vaguer in sense than the masculine, or whether the sense differs in any other way. s This may be the sense of the extremely obscure Scholium on Theog. X 1 7 (or i l8). The reference of 6O?v is not clear, and it is not necessary to suppose that it refers back to the remarks of Zeno Citieus, SVF. 1, i0o. If it does so refer, then i 1 9 may have been athetized in late antiquity on the basis of Zeno's theory, bound to have a wide influence. xi 8 by itself would be felt incongruous - though perhaps read by Chalcidius - and doubt thus cast on it. 6 Despite an oral objection to this effect by Mr. M.

It is difficult to see in what sense the Earth could have been for Hesiod the seat of all things always, which it becomes with the omission of i i 8. Could he really have regarded the everyday meteorological phenomena and the stars as seated on earth? There is no direct evidence for such a view, and it seems primafacie unlikely. H. FrInkelI, indeed, takes 17 as a phrase complete in itself and comments: 'Fiur den Bauern Hesiod ist die ganze Welt der Gegenstinde und Wesen auf die Erde gegrundet und aus ihr hervorgegangen.' But here Frankel simplifies the problem by taking &amp;8og not only as 'foundation' but also as 'source'. This would make coherent sense, and would be an appropriate view for a peasant Hesiod2; but unfortunately 98o4 does not mean 'source' either here or any- where else, so this interpretation is hardly cogent. It is perhaps over-bold to suggest that the sense given by the omission of i 18 is impossible for Hesiod, especially in view of its adoption by Plutarch and other late Greek authors. But the omission creates a difficulty not observed by these writers. (It is conceivable that Plutarch and the rest were influenced by Theogony 736-40 when they made Tartarus a separate entity in the cosmogony.) An important general argument against the admission of Tartarus as a separate entity to the cosmogony was advanced by C. Robert.3 He pointed out that Tartarus is 'wesent- lich unschopferisch', and this remains true in spite of Tartarus' doubtful status as the father of Typhoeus at Theogony 820-2.4 It may be added that Tartarus is not an in- dispensable element in the cosmogonical process like Eros. The most probable interpretation of the cosmogonical passage thus removes Tartarus as a separate entity from the Hesiodic cosmogony, at least as outlined in Theogony i i6ff. There follows here an analysis of the cosmogony resulting from this reading of the text. All agree at least that the first entity to appear is Chaos, whether X I 6 describes its existence from eternity or its coming-to-be. What Chaos meant in the time of Hesiod himself is far from certain, and in any case is hardly relevant to our immediate problems; its meaning for Hesiod's successors, I Dichtung and Philosophie2 p. 1 2. 2 I do not commit myself to any answer to the question when, or whether, Hesiod ceased to be a peasant. See e.g. E. Meyer, Genethliakon fur Carl Robert (Berlin 19I o), pp. iSgff., and T. A. Sinclair, Hesiod, Works and Days, (London 1932) p. XXII and n. 1 6. On the social position of a rhapsode see B.

(2) Tartarus is nowhere else in the Theogony personified. (3) The line is irrelevant to the probable purpose of the Typhoeus-episode (See Phronesis Vol. VII (1962) p. 4). (4) The idea is one which a rhapsode - or even a scribe - might well invent to supply Typhoeus with a father, and one at that who is as terrifying as possible. This is not to prejudice the genuineness of the Typhoeus-episode as a whole. 3</page><page sequence="4">poetical and philosophical, and its relation to the Milesian apZjn, Will be discussed below. Next after Chaos is the coming-to-be of Farth, apparently accompanied by Eros, the principle of generation. To pursue the order of narration further, the next entities to appear in the text are Night and Day; Night is the offspring of Chaos itself, Day is the child of Night and her brother Erebos. Day is accompanie(d by Aether, the bright sky. The next event recorded by Hesiod is the logical com- pletion of the previous one; it is difficult to imagine day an(1 night without the heavenly bodies, and so the neext step is the fornation of the Heaven with the heavenly bodies. The parent of the starry Heaven - the point is important - is Earth. In Hesiod's account there follow the long Mountains and the Sea, both apparently or explicitly without sexual intercourse. Next in order of narration is the birth of Ocean, the child of Earth and Heaven. Here the cosmogony proper, as later philosophers probably saw, comes to an end; the birth of Cronius and the Titans belongs more to mythology than to cosmogony. Such is the order in which Hesiod narrates the cosmogoniical events. Since it is not a priori certain that this was also the or(ler in which Hesiod believe(d them to have taken place, one nmust analyse such chrono- logical data as Hesiod offers. Chaos is unequivocally state(d in ii 6 to have been the first of the gods; and Earth undoubtedly came next. One would expect Eros, as the principle of generation, to prece(le the first sexual reproduction', which results in the birth of Day and Aether. Further, there seems little point in the `7?LTM of i i 6 if Earth at least did not precede Night. It is remotely possible that Earth and Night were meant to be contemporaneous, but hardly probable. A point that is less clear is the temporal relation between Day and Night on the onle hand, and starry Heaven on the other. Starry Heaven might have been placed after Erebus, Night, Aether and Day from no other nmotive than Hesiod's desire for literary reasons to finish with Chaos' offspring before proceeding to the long list of Earth's descendants. But Hesiod's tech- nique is not in general so inadequate that this is a compelling argunment for the view that his order of narration is other than chronological. Logically Day and Night should clearly be closely associated with the starry Heaven, and positive argument for Heaven's juniority is hard to find. At least starry Heaven may safely be saidl to follow Earth chrono- logically, since Earth is the parent of Heaven. The priority of Heaven over Mountains and Sea is again not made certain by the family relation- I Cf. K. von Fritz, Festschrift Bruno Snell pp. 3off. 4</page><page sequence="5">ships, and conceivably all three could be thought synchronous; but it is likely to be significant that Ocean and Sea are placed next to each other in the story, and in default of evidence to the contrary it seems legitimate to presume that the order of narration here is the chronological order also. Parentage makes it safe at any rate to suppose that Earth, starry Heaven and Ocean came to be in that order. There is nothing to prove at any point that Hesiod's order of narration was not the order in which he believed these events to have happened. Further, it might well be thought the most natural thing for a story- teller to tell his tale in chronological order, and one would expect power- ful evidence to the contrary before refusing to believe that Hesiod did not here do the most natural thing. Moreover, families of twins and triplets, unless carefully announced to the reader/hearer as such, would be calculated to confuse. One may accordingly proceed with confidence on the assumption that Hesiod himself did not desert chronological order in his story, and with even more confidence that whatever Hesiod's own intentions in the matter he would be taken in the Archaic period as having set down events in the order in which they happened. For the sake of clarity the most likely order of events in the cosmogonical passage of the Theogony is given here in tabular form. (i) Chaos (2) Earth and Eros (3) Erebus and Night, followed by their children Aether and Day (4) Heaven with heavenly bodies, arising out of Earth (5) Mountains and Sea (6) Ocean. (b) Anaximander's cosmogony. An account of Anaximander's cosmogony might no doubt be expected to begin with the Unlimited; but this presents problems as complex as those of Chaos, and will be considered laterl. For the rest of this cosmogony there are two main pieces of evidence, namely a passage from the Pseudo-Plutarchean Stromateis2 and a passage of Aristotle's Meteoro- logica3 with Alexander of Aphrodisias' commentary thereon4. The provenance and reliability of some parts of this evidence are not above suspicions, and though recent writers have in general6 continued to follow the traditional view the points concerned still need discussion. Pseudo-Plutarch's remarks at this point are most I See pp. 34ff below. 2 Stromateis 2 (DK 12AIo). 3 Meteor. B x. 353b6ff. (DK 12A27). 4 In Meteor. p. 67.3ff. (Hayduck) (DK I2A27).

Kirk, KR p. 139, Kahn op. cit. pp. 6Sff. s</page><page sequence="6">likely to go back to Theophrastus! though in the absence of a doxographic parallel for the passage the point is not susceptible of absolute proof. That Theophrastus dealt with cosmogonies is of course abundantly clear from doxographic statements concerning other thinkers. Pseudo-Plutarch is a regrettably poor authority, and can indeed be shown to have omitted some of the story altogether2, but though he is liable to distortion of a Theophrastean account by confusion with another philosopher, it is not likely that his mechanical modes of work produced many straightforward mis-statements of fact, and nothing shows that this passage contains any. The problems raised by the passage of Aristotle's Meteorologica and Alexander's commentary are more formidable. The evidence has nowhere been set out in full, but the reader will find most of it both in KR and in Kahn's book3. Now Aristotle at Meteor. 3s3b6ff. gives an account of three ancient views on the origin of the sea, of which the last two account also for the sea's saltness. The last two are, respectively, that the sea is the sweat of the earth and therefore salty, and that the straining of the sea through the earth is enough to give it a tang like that of water passed through ashes. The first view is of those who hold, apparently as one connected theory, the following doctrines: (1)4 The place round the earth was at first moist. (2) This moisture was dried up and evaporated (two aspects of the same process) by the sun. (3) This process results in the division of the primeval moisture into two parts. (4) These are (4. i) the sea and (4.2 1) the winds and (4.2 2) the turnings of the sun and moon. (5) The continuation of this whole process means that the sea is becoming dried up, and will eventually be completely dry. This same theorys is probably described again, from a different point of view and with less precision, at Aristotle Meteor. 35sa 22ff., where the following points are made: in the doctrine here noted, first the earth is in the beginning moist (not, as in (i) the part around it, but see below), and then the part around it is heated by the sun (cp. (1) and (2)); this is followed by the formation of &amp;H)p and the enignmatic 'expansion of the whole heaven': the &amp;Jp produces both the winds and the turnings of the sun (cp. (4. 2 i) and 4.22)). The omission of the sea in this second passage of Aristotle need not surprise us, since the subject in this context is no longer the origin of the sea, but the cause of the solstices. This theory is in no way clearly distinguished by Aristotle from the theory (i) to (s), but is contrasted6 with the view of others who hold that the heavenly bodies feed on moisture and turn round at the solstices to seek further nourishment in fresher I Diels, Doxographi Graeci p. i 8. 2 After the formation of the heavenly bodies Ps.-Plut. gives an account of the origin of man. Now Aetius (DK 12A30) offers an account of the origin of animals, and Hippolytus (DK 12Aii, Ref. 1,6,6) has zoogony and anthropogony in that order. It follows that Ps.-Plut. has omitted the zoogony from the Theophrastean account, and may well have omitted more, e.g. the origin of the sea. 3 Locc. citt. (p. j n. 6) 4 In what follows these numerals will be used as convenient symbols of the doctrines here I isted. s I cannot see why Gigon, op. cit. p. 94, should say that Aristotle clearly distinguishes the two, and accuse Alexander of confusing them. Confusion there is in Alexander, but nothing proves it at this particular point. 6 Where it is necessary to his purpose Aristotle is not above distinguishing doctrines held in his opinion by one and the same thinker; cp. KR pp. i off. But this, fortunately, is very rare, and is not likely to have happened here. 6</page><page sequence="7">pastures'. Unfortunately Aristotle does not put a name to either view, and for identi- fication of the philosophers concerned we must fall back on either the general doxo- graphic tradition of Presocratic meteorology and cosmogony or the commentators on this part of the Meteorologica, notably Alexander of Aphrodisias. A word of caution may be necessary before analysing what Alexander says. It must be conceded that this commentary is hardly worthy of this great Aristotelian. Its editor in the Berlin edition, Hayduck, justly remarked2 that the notes were 'interpretandi diligentia et subtilitate aliis eiusdem interpretis commentariis aliquanto inferiora', but not so much so that one should believe them supposititious. Some confusion we may reasonably expect to find in this Alexander. Now at in Meteor. p. 67.3ff., commenting on Aristotle Meteor. 3M3b6ff., Alexander gives an account of a theory which includes (I), (2), (3), (4.1), (4.21), (4.22) and (5), and is clearly meant to be indeed the theory described by Aristotle, but which in Alexander's account includes also the pasture- theory. The points (4.i) and (S) are mentioned last and following them Alexander adds -ro6 -rv- 86Ron yivcTo, g 'Ta-ropeZt &amp;69poaro, 'AvocovN8p6q Te xat ALOykv, Atoykvrq gi xal cd q &amp; X),up67rro; -rcrxvrv Xkye . . . &amp; . , the additional theory of Diogenes being that the sun evaporates the sweet parts, leaving behind the salty parts. Now here we have to decide what precisely, according to Alexander, Theophrastus ascribed to both Anaximander and Diogenes. The answer seems to be that Alexander says here that Theophrastus ascribed (x) to (5) and the pasture-theory to both. The justification for this statement is to be found in the structure of Alexander's whole paragraph of comment on Aristotle 3 3b6ff. Each of the other two views mentioned here by Aristotle is ascribed, clearly as a whole, to one or more Presocratics; the earth-sweat theory to Empedocles and the earth-strainer theory to Anaxagoras and Metrodorus. There is an unmistakable and obviously intentional correspondence between 67. 3-12 ot ,LiV yap Ovtov. ...

It is apparent that as the last two ascriptions are of the whole theory concerned, so is the first. Nor should it be supposed that Anaximander and Diogenes are in Theophrastus or Alexander carelessly conflated; for Alexander is careful to say where Diogenes added to the theories of his predecessor. But there exist other reasons for ascribing to Theophrastus the attribution of the complex (l) to (5) to Anaximander and Diogenes vithout the pasture-theory. It is necessary to work backwards from -rai 't- r 86W% kykve-ro.... 'Av4E cpoq .... and consider where it is possible for the citation, which evidently ends here3, to begin. To this end must be adduced, as by Kirk,4 Alexander's commentary on the second passage I In what follows this will be called the 'pasture-theory'. 2 Praefatio, p.

Here Alexander himself distinguishes (following Aristotle) between the pasture-theory and a theory composed of (i), (2), implicitly (3), (4.21), the addition of the expansion of the whole heavens by the vapours (from Aristotle), and also the substitution for (+. 2 2) of the tur- nings of the air or the heaven (Alexander is not sure which), this last following a mistaken interpretation of the awkward demonstratives in Aristotle. Here Alexander adds that 'of this opinion, as said above, were Anaximander and Diogenes.' Now this ascription must be at least of some view concerning rpowrat, for that is what the pre- ceding sentence is about; it follows that the previous ascription must also have contained, among other tlhings, a doctrine concerning cpoTca. This shows that the theories ascribed to Anaximander in the first passage must include everything back as far as Tpo7r&amp;4 J'AlOU ,re xxd aeX?v-v,. But in the second passage of Alexander (which differs in this respect from the second passage of Aristotle) there is no reference to the turnings of sun and moon. Consequently, if we are to find anything in Alexander to justify the phrase 'as said above', we must look for the doctrines common to the two passages, and this takes us back in each case to the complex (i) to (5); for the texts of Aristotle and Alexander nowhere suggest that this complex of theories should be (livided. It appears that Alexan- der at 67.3ff. had in mind not so much any particular kind of Tpwrod nor any particular method of accounting for thein in detail, as the origin of the sea. The carelessness over the rpo7roct is the more readily forgivable since the whole of that passage is concerned with the sea and its origins. The matter may be summed up thus: the commentator has on this question nmade two slips. On p. 67 he has added the pasture-theory where it was not applicable, and on p. 73 he has misinterpreted Aristotle and talked about the turnings of air or heaven when Aristotle almost certainly meant the turnings of the sun. The first slip is shown up by the agreement against it of Aristotle at 34s4b 34 to 35s 22 and Alexander hinmself at p. 73; and the second is exposed by the agreement of Aristotle at 3 s3bg with Alexander himself at p. 67 (apart from the inherent improbability of it as an interpretation of Aristotle 3Ssa2s). There are no grounds for suspicion that Alexander has gone wrong on any other point in these passages; by far the most probable reading of the evidence is that Alexander ascribed the whole theory of the origin of the sea outlined at Aristotle Meteor. 3S3b6ff. to Anaximander and Diogenes, and that he did so on the authority of Theophrastus - authority virtually conclusive on such a point, and certainly not undermined by Aristotle's failure to mention Anaximander in this connection. It may be added that Aetius III, i6, I (DK 12A27) looks very like a garbled version of this attribution of Theophrastus'. Aetius further remarks that Anaximander believed the saltness of the sea to be the result of scorching. Alexander, however, at in Meteor. 67. 3ff. neither makes nor at- tributes to Theophrastus any mention of a theory of Anaximander on this subject, though he explains Diogenes' views. It seems very doubtful if Anaximander answered this particular question; the chances appear about equal that Alexander failed to draw attention to the point and that Aetius or his immediate source simply invented a crude answer for Anaximander to a problem which had become commonplace, and invented xptaenq T6G YCvO%Lvv% tJrOn TOiU T4JMLOu OCa0Oi"VOCL, XOcL To0TOV (iTOL T6V (pEoP ?,Y?C i5 TOv 7iBLOV (Iixov) nVCpocTa TC 7rxpCXZaOkL xaCtL av4o xCx TX5 TpO7rg OU'TO5 TZOLeV, TOL To iO ;to TOVOVPXVOV.

Either the crudity or the non-existence of the views of the physicists under discussion would support the hypothesis that their theories were early ones, and that our sources are not leading us wholly astray in attributing the whole cosmogonical episode to Anaximander. Anything in the nature of an ecpyrosis seems unlikely for Anaximander, but it is hard to find anything to exclude a theory of alter- nating flood and drought'. At all events Pseudo-Plutarch tells us that the next step after the postulated existence of the Unlimited, the first step towards the for- mation of a world, was the separation off from the Unlimited of2 t 'rx toi3 O'COu yoVL.Lov OEpPO05 re xcx't 4UZpou. This mysterious intermediary between the Unlimited and the world again presents problems of sense and philosophy of the greatest difficulty. To deal with them would take us too far afield; but it is difficult not to agree with Kirk3 that 'Since the extant fragment suggests that the world is still composed of opposites, it seems legitimate to accept from both Theophrastus and Aristotle that opposites were involved in cosmogony.' From the 'productive' a sphere of flame grew round the air surrounding the earth. There is no apparent reason why one should not assume on the basis of this statement of Pseudo-Plutarch that there was air sur- rounding earth in the first place before the flame grew round the complex of earth and air. The sphere of flame breaks off, and apparently breaks up, to form the circles of fire (obscured for the most part by air) which according to Anaximander formed the heavenly bodies. The cosmogony given by Pseudo-Plutarch ends here, but the Aristotelian passage is most probably cosmogonical in import, as Burnet4 used to hold. What Aristotle actually says is that some thinkers un-named by him held the earth to be 'at first' surrounded by a moist area, which was dried by the sun, the evaporated part forming the winds I I regret that I have not seen H.

In the end the whole sea will dry up. These views, Alexander says, Theophrastus assigned to Anaximander and to Diogenes. Now we were left by Pseudo-Plutarch with the earth, the heavenly bodies, and the 'air' between these two. Air in this context was almost certainly a mist, whether or not Anaximander distinguished between mist and atmospheric air; otherwise no view of the heavenly bodies reasonably attributable to Anaximander makes sense; for 'air' could not partially obscure the rings of flame. One cannot properly equate Pseudo-Plutarch's a&amp; p directly with Aristotle's Dypov, for although Anaximander and his interpreters both knew that mist was moist2 neither the assumption of an inaccuracy in Pseudo-Plutarch's use of &amp;lp, which cannot in Greek be equivalent to 'URp, nor the supposition that Aristotle used &amp;OXT[Ax LV oddly (it normally refers to liquids vapor- ized, not to vapours further rarefied) is necessary or fully convincing. It looks as though the water surrounding the earth was formed some- how between the events described by Pseudo-Plutarch and those in Aristotle; it is not possible to be dogmatic on the process at work, for either 'separation off' from earth and/or 'air', or 'growth round' the earth are possibilities. This water, in any case, produced under the sun's heat winds, turnings and sea as Aristotle details. That the sea at least is to be regarded as posterior to the formation of the heavenly bodies is strongly suggested bv the mention of the sun twice each by Aristotle and Alexander in connection with the drying process - a mention, it seems to me, hardly contradicted by the reference of Aetius and Hippolytus to the 'fire'.3 Our knowledge of Anaximander's I C. H. Kahn op. cit. p. 66 says; 'There can be no question of interpreting the winds themselves as causes of the rpowro'. But this seems too rigid an attitude to the particles .T.C...xal ...; 'not only the winds but also [as a consequencel the turnings' seems a possible paraphrase (Cp. in general Denniston, Greek Particles2 p. ' S). Guthrie op. cit. p. 97 n.4 suggests that the 'air' causing the turnings contains moisture; which may be true, but does not affect in the least Aristotle's and Alexander's distinction between pasture-theorists and the cosmogonists in question. 2 For the Peripatetics see Bonitz Index Aristotelicus s.v. &amp;4'p; Hesiod Erga 548ff. supplies proof (lacking in Homer) that Anaximander's contemporaries were familiar with the moistness of mist. There 'air' is described as being drawn up by the wind from rivers and falling thereafter in rain, or blowing as a wind driving clouds. The similarity to Anaximander's cosmogony is evident, despite the different drying agent. Hesiod does associate winds and heavenly bodies, at Theogony 3 7 8ff. 3 Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy4 p. 64 (followed by Guthrie op. cit. p. 94) suppose(i the expansion of the heavens to be the cause of the sphere's break-off and the formation of the heavenly bodies. But the expansion is mentioned as the result of the sun's heat. The break-off of the sphere must therefore remain obscure. I 0</page><page sequence="11">cosmogony here comes to an end, and the cosmogony itself probably also came to an end here; at least nothing that was of importance in later cosmogonies has been omitted. The chief events in Anaximander's cos- mogony may be briefly tabulated as follows: (i) The Unlimited (i a) The 'productive of hot and cold" (2) The earth comes-to-be, surrounded by 'air'. (3) The sphere of flame grows round the earth-and-air.2 (4) The heavenly bodies come into being from the sphere. (S) The Ocean comes-to-be. The table on p. x4. below will help to make the com- parison with Hesiod easier, but this may be said here; apart from the mysterious 'productive': apart also from the selection of the four cosmic masses (but see Theogony io6f. and 736f.),3 the chief point at which Anaximander deserts Hesiod is in making the heavenly bodies arise not from the earth, but from the sphere of flame, whose origin it is difficult on the basis of Pseudo-Plutarch not to dissociate from the earth. 4 I Kirk, KR p. I 32f., well emphasizes that y6vL,uov is more likely to be a Peripatetic than an Anaximandrean word, and that Cornford's comparison with the 'Orphic' cosmogonical egg is unhelpful. The suggestion of Vlastos (Classical Philology Vol. XLII (I947) p. 171 n. I40) that the y6vtLLov was merely a process is most improbable; how a process can be separated off from a stuff is not clear, and Democritus fr. 167 is not an adequate parallel; the vortex in that passage is stuff undergoing process, not mere process (also against Vlastos, KR pp. 132f.). What one would expect the y6vL,uov to be is a mixture of hot and cold; and it may be the y6vLIiov which is responsible for doxo- graphical references to a mixture at the start of Anaximander's cosmogony. For the nature of the Unlimited see below pp. 3off. 2 The subsequent fate of the sphere notwithstanding, it is not unreasonable to associate it with the Aether. 3 It may be noted that Eros is too mythical a figure for Anaximander, and that Night and Day also fail to re-appear. It may be that Night and Day were rejected also on the grounds that they are of temporal rather than spatial significance, since in Hesiod Night and Day occupy the same space but occupy it by turns; see Theogony 748ff. (These lines were discussed at Phronesis Vol. VII I962 No. l, pp. i6f., where I forgot by over- sight to compare Parmenides fr. B i. 4ff. Since I do not believe that Parmenides locates the halls of Night or the gates of the paths of Night and Day with any clarity or precision the discussion needs no further modification; I doubt if OxWptoct at Parm. 1, 13 is to be taken locally, as K. Deichgraber suggests at Parmenides' Auffahrt zur Gottin des Rechts (Akad. der Wiss. und der Lit. in Mainz, Abhand. der Geistes- und Sozialwiss.

It should be observed that the philosophical cosmogonies so far as they are known to us ignore the distinction between sea and Ocean, perhaps follow- ing Hesiod Theog.

For the cosmogony of Anaximenes we are dependent once nmore for the most part on Pseudo-Plutarch,' though his statements may be checked in sone cases by those of Hippolytus.2 It is unfortunate that Ps.-Plutarch is clearly shown by Hippolytus to have been wrong about the genesis of the heavenly bodies in Anaximenes' cosmogony, since this weakens our already shaky confidence in Ps.-Plutarch. But the motive for this mistake is clear; it is nothing but confusion between Anaximenes and his follower (in many respects) Anaxagoras3; in the rest of Ps.-Plutarch's account no such motive can be shown to be present, and in the absence of such motive for conscious or unconscious falsification we may provisionally accept the rest of Ps.-Plutarch's version of this cosmogony. To anticipate, if the cosmogony in Pseudo-Plutarch and Hippolytus turns out to resemble Hesiod's at several points, it is not likely to be an a priori scheme of Theophrastus4, since the ancients did not anticipate Cornford's discovery that Hesiod and the Milesian cosmogonies were akin; if the Peripatetics were influence(d by the Hesiodic cosmogony and formed a priori schemes based on it it would be surprising; any influence of Hesiod on the Peripatetics is more likely to have been transmitte(d through the lonian philoso- phers than to have been direct. The first stage in the cosnogony of Anaximnenes was the presence of 'Air'; this 'Air' was possibly, though not in nmy opinion probably, in the state described by Hippolytus at Ref. 1, 7, 2, to be discussed below.S The next stage is the condensation of some of the Air to form Earth. The result of this is the same as that of stage (2) in nmy summary of Anaximan- Xa -rVc LXT0oUt0U XOyO05 a9?LpOV 1?pLU9UJVOCL 6) 7tLpL r7]V yI)V &amp;pL q -rig Uv8p cp 9)Ot6v. Here the antecedent of -ro&amp;rou is almost certainly the y6vLpoV, the only other conceiva- ble antecedent being the grammatically subordinate and therefore unlikely L8Qtou. It is difficult to follow Kahn (op. cit. pp. 103 and 15i), who assimilates Anaximander to later thinkers by having the sphere of fire, dependent on the evaporating moisture, grow out of and around the primeval moist air like bark round a tree. For whatever the antecedent of rou&amp;rou, it is certainly not the air, and to grow round is by no means the same as to grow out of. Kahn takes Anaximander's simile as more exact in detail than its likely models, the similes of Epic, would suggest. His citation of Ar. Metaph. 98 3b2 3, where Aristotle suggests that water's role as generator and nourisher of heat was one source for its priority in Thales, is not probative; for this is only a conjecture of Aristo- tIe's; its probable basis in Aristotle's knowledge of early Greek thought proves nothing for Anaximander in particular. Gigon (op. cit. p. I X 2) says the sun's fire coinwes to be 'unmittelbar aus dem Unbegrenzten', a statement built on less evidence still. Stromateis 3 (DK 13A6). 2 Ref.

The situation now is that earth is surrounded by Air; obviously there is Air above the earth, and we are told by Aristotle that according to Anaximenes the earth floated on Air.z Anaximenes probably did not share the views of Anaximander on the shape of the earth,3 and it is conceivable, though improbable,4 that Air did not mean the same thing to both of them: but the essentials of the situation are the same at this stage of both cosnmogonies. What follows in Anaxi- mander is the formation of the Aether, or at least of the sphere of flame, but this is not explicitly detailed in connection with Anaximenes. Next in Anaximenes' cosmogony, according to our sources, comes the formation of the heavenly bodies. These arise from the earth, in the sense that earth emits a mist or vapour which is rarefied to become fire, and then rises to form the heavenly bodies. It is difficult to believe that there is no historical connection between this item and Hesiod's state- ment that Earth gave birth to starry Heaven. Moreover, in this respect Anaximenes is following Hesiod where Anaximander deserted him. Here, unfortunately, our reasonably secure knowledge of Anaximenes' cos- mogony comes to an end; Pseudo-Plutarch did not trace Milesian cos- mogonies beyond the genesis of the heavenly bodies. Accordingly we know nothing from this source of Anaximenes' version of the origin of the sea. Theophrastus5 does not help directly, since he is clearly referring to the processes current in the developed world. But it is a priori likely that Anaximenes did describe the sea's origin, since he had a process (condensation-rarefaction) admirably suited to its description and his world would have been strangely incomplete without it; on these grounds it is reasonable not to except Anaximenes from Aristotle's generalisation6 that all the early physicists accounted for the sea. Now Pseudo-Plutarch does occasionally omit things of importance7, but no reason springs to mind why he should have omitted the sea from Anaximenes' cosmogony if it were in fact formed before the stage at which he gave up transcribing Theophrastus. Further, it would seem I p.

Despite the differences between the columns in this table, the correspondences are close enough in nos. (3) to (5) inclusive, to show that if the account of the cosmogonies given above is sound, then either Hesiod's cosmogony or one very like it had an abiding influence on the Milesian thinkers, and that the order of events in the philosophical accounts, in Anaximenes certainly no less than in Anaximander, was derived either from Hesiod or from a source known also to Hesiod. If a common source is to be postulated then the most likely location of it is in the Near East. This much at least will not be new to students of Cornford's writings. But one point emerges from the discussion which had not hitherto been observed: Anaximenes, since he preserved one feature of Hesiod's cosmogony which was abandoned by Anaximander, must have made independent use either of Hesiod or of Hesiod's source. If the account given above of the relevant cosmogonies is accepted, then it must be agreed that Anaximenes did not merely take over the pattern of his cosmogony from Anaximander, but took at one point a more 14</page><page sequence="15">conservative view. I hope to show later in this paper that such inde- pendence in conservatism is to be found elsewhere in Anaximenes. For present purposes, the question whether Hesiod's Theogony or an Oriental source of it was the mythological writing most used by the Milesians is not relevant, interesting though it is in itself. Even if the Milesians made use primarily of Oriental works, it is reasonable to suppose that they were aware that a fellow-Greek, invested with all the authority that Hesiod early acquired, had tapped the common source before they did. There can be little doubt that the Hesiodic poems were known to the lonians of the sixth century B.C. Evidence for the lonian lyric and iambic poets' knowledge of Hesiod, both of the Erga and of the Theogony, was quoted by Rzach :2 few, if any, scholars now believe that the plagiarism apparent in the passages there cited is Hesiod's rather than the lyrists'. But if Anaximander and Anaximenes borrowed from Hesiod, or from a source known to him, Thales' cosmogony, if he had one, probably was very different. It seems not unlikely that the later Milesians owed to Thales their apparent depersonalisation of the forces and powers at work or in existence at the beginning of the world; but in other respects their cosmogonies represent a pro-Hesiodic reaction against the ideas of Thales on the subject. There is no need to go into excessive detail here, since there exist already at least two valuable accounts of as much as can be reasonably conjectured about Thales.3 Accordingly, only a brief summary of the essential points is given below. All that antiquity has handed down to us concerning Thales is a tangle of guesses, more or less probable, and anecdotes, more or less improbable. One thing, however, becomes more evident as we gropingly unravel the tangle. The view of the world and its birth which emerges from the Hesiodic poems in our possession had little or nothing to do with Thales' thinking about the world. Aristotle4 tells us that Thales believed the earth to float on water, and to be supported by it. We know further that there was at any rate something in the hearsay reports built on by Aristotle which seemed to him sufficient foundation for the I It may be doubted whether the chronology of the ancients placing Anaximenes later and making him a companion or pupil of Anaximander was ever based on sufficient evidence to make Anaximander's priority certain. I follow the traditional view in this assessment merelyfaute de mieux. Cp. Kerterd, Mus. Helv. 19 E4 pp. I 1 7ff., Guthrie p. i I En. 2 RE s.v. Hesiodos, XVer Halbband, cols. I 176f. 3 U.

I S</page><page sequence="16">statement that Thales' water was the material substratum, or something like it, of all the objects in the world. It can only be guessed to-day what the point or points of resemblance were which caused Aristotle to assimilate Thales' water to his own 'material cause': the present writer is not of those who believe the assimilation to be historically accurate. But unless Aristotle was more than usually careless it must have been something more than the belief that the earth floats on water. A reasonable guess - one can expect no more - is that Thales was reported to have held that the earth arose out of water, which was there in the beginning. Like the view, otherwise unknown in early Greece, that the earth floats on water, this theory can be traced with some plausibility to Egyptian doctrines which Thales may well have met in Egypt itself or heard of from citizens of the Milesian colony at Naucratis, or from other traders. This (hypothetical) doctrine that earth arises from water is scarcely acclimatized on Greek soil before Thales. It is true that Homer at Iliad XIV 201 and 246 calls Ocean the origin of all things: but Kirk-Raven' are righlt in suggesting that these statements are 'unique and unexpected', and it may be added that, for what the point is worth, they come from a passage (the ALo 'A=ocrr) often suspected on other grounds of being later than the nmain body of the Iliad. The point to emphasize is that, despite Platoz and Aristotle3, the ideas of Thales are not very likely to have been derived solely froi these two lines of Homer. Homer gives no indication that the earth floats on water, whereas some Oriental sources4 do offer this suggestion; so Thales was dependent on sources not followed in this respect by Homer. Whether Thales obtained the doctrine of water's priority from Babylon or from Egypt is not strictly relevant to the present argument, though there seems at present to be a balance of opinion, if not of probability, in favour of Egypts. Hesiodic ideas, expressed at sonle length at the outset of the Theogony, may fairly be assumed to have become familiar in Greek lands by the sixth century B.C., but a mere couple of passing references in a Homeric passage of doubtful authenticity will not have been anything like so widely known or highly regarded. If this doubt be accepted - and its status is more conjectural than nmost of this argument - it appears that there was a break in the tradition of I op. cit. p. IS. 2Theaetetus IS2e. 3 Metaphysics 983b27-3S - a markedly cautious statement. 4 Cp. Kirk-Raven, op. cit. p. 13, n. i. 5 U. Holscher op. cit. I 6</page><page sequence="17">philosophical cosmogony between Thales - always assuming that Thales had a cosmogonical theory - and Anaximander.' Such a break is not inconsistent with what little the ancients conjectured about the re- lations between the two men. Thales was at one and the same time introducing new or almost new cosmogonical ideas from the Near East, and abandoning the personal anthropomorphic deities employed in Near Eastern as well as Greek cosmogonies. His successors adopted from him the abolition of the personal deities who play so large a part even in Hesiod's cosmogony, thin and metaphorical though some of them appear there, and also of the process of sexual generation which (sometimes as a thinly-disguised metaphor) Hesiod still adopted to explain a high proportion of the cosmogonical events. But Anaximander went to a Greek source, or at least to a source which had become through Hesiod familiar and authoritative to the Greeks of the preceding century or so, for the detailed order of events at the beginning of the world. Anaximander apparently rejected the less familiar Egyptian and/or Babylonian myths in favour of the more accessible and familiar ones. But he was somewhat more free in his use of them than his successor Anaximenes, who at an important stage in cosmogony returns to Hesiod's view, showing thus independence of Anaximander. It is not inconsistent with the normal estimate of the relative originality of the two men that at this point in which Anaximenes is independent of Anaximander he shows his greater conservatism. 4. Primary substances (a) Hesiod's Chaos. This section will be concerned only incidentally with the Oriental antecedents of Hesiod's Chaos, since the writer is not qualified to I The attempt of Kahn (op. cit. p. 87) to assimilate the cosmogonies of Thales and Anaximander is unsuccessful. There is too little evidence on Thales for us to be sure of the position of Earth in his initial moisture; we can not be sure that earth was already present in the water or whether it appeared afterwards, or even whether Thales asked this question at all. Kahn seems to underestimate the significance of earth at this stage of Anaximander's cosmogony; there is no reason to suppose that it was mentioned at this point 'only by anticipation' - the fact that the dry land has not emerged does not mean that earth is not in existence, albeit surrounded by moisture. Further, though both are moist, Thales' water was probably distinctly more so than Anaximander's &amp;imp and decidedly less dark. Kahn's further statement that the primary phase of the three Milesian cosmogonies is a continuous source of rising water-vapour is virtually unsupported for Thales and unlikely for Anaximander. In the latter it does not become such a source until the sphere of flame appears, probably not before the creation of the sun (Aristotle Meteor. 3ssa2 1, cited by Kahn p. 66). I 7</page><page sequence="18">discuss them in detail. In any case, it is more directly relevant to the present discussion to determine how the Greeks of the Archaic period interpreted Hesiod than to discover what the poet himself intended. For this purpose, even if interpolated to a greater extent than was argued in the first half of this paper, our text of the Theogony, as edited from Mss. and testimonia by Rzach, is adequate. If interpolations can be detected, then they are probably the work of rhapsodes, and in all probability to be dated in the archaic period. It is possible, but not likely, that they were influenced by the views of the philosophers; it is more probable that they represent the general archaic interpretation of Hesiod's original text, in so far as that differed from the Byzantine text. Rhapsodes were not normally philosophers. At Theogony 1 23ff. Hesiod relates that the offspring of Chaos itself were Night and Erebos, who gave birth in their turn to Day and Aether. Kirk and Raven' rightly suggest that this family offers support for the view that Chaos was thought of as dark and gloomy. But they do not take up the suggestion of Paley ad loc.2 that 'Erebus is the subterranean darkness, as opposed to night which shrouds the upper world'(Paley's italics). That Night in Hesiod has her dwelling in the underworld,3 does nothing to diminish the force of Paley's observation, for Night's function is indeed to shroud the upper world. In fact the genealogy of the cosmogonical passage becomes easier to understand if Chaos was associ- ated in Hesiod's mind both with the upper and lower world. This argument would not be conclusive by itself, but gains in plausibility when we consider that Hesiod and/or his successors can be shown to have associated Chaos now with the upper, now with the lower darkness. The association of Chaos with the underworld may be supported by the placing at the horizon of the 'sources and limits' of the cosmic masses. Even if not by Hesiod himself, as supporting evidence from an early rhapsode it would not be without weight. One at least of Hesiod's readers thought that part at least of Chaos was below the earth. The rhapsode who interpolated Theog. 807ff. evidently held that this was so, since he put the Titans' prison 7ep-qv X&amp;o4 CoypoZo (8 I4). Another, explicit, mention of Chaos in the Theogony presents serious difficulties. In this passage, 69gff. and especially 700, certainty about the meaning of Chaos and its location is probably unattainable; but some hints may be found in the context. Whether the cosmogony attributed to San- I KR P- 31. 2 Cp. also Peppmuller, Hesiodos p.

The arguments adduced by Kirk,2 in favour of the space between earth and sky as the location of the fire which overcame Chaos are as follows. (I) Why should the heat (Kirk's italics) penetrate to the underworld? (2) The Titans are not in the underworld, but on Mount Othrys (632). (3) We are told that the flash reaches the upper air (697), and it is relevant to add that the heat also filled the whole intermediate region. (,+) The following lines imagine earth and skyas clashing together, and the emphasis is not on the underworld. These arguments are of varying force, and none of them is immediately decisive. In reply to (i) may be urged the reverse question; why not? It could hardly be suggested that the penetrative powers of heat were unknown in Hesiod's time, as they must be immediately discernible every time a house catches fire. If a conflagration which starts above the earth makes itself (literally) felt below the earth and through its thickness, then it is a very big fire indeed. I cannot see that the idea is much less natural and effective than the notion (68 If.) that a missile's concussive effect can be felt below the earth. The relevance of (2) is perhaps doubtful; The Titans are not in the sea any more than they are in the underworld, but the seething of the sea is graphically described. Mount Othrys is not near the sea, and the mention of the sea is by no means necessary. If it is to be mentioned, then why not the underworld too? (3) is not fully cogent either; it may be objected first that 9X603 usually means something more than 'flash', though it need not necessarily mean more, and secondly that with the Mss. reading jepoc for Peppmiiller's conjecture to&amp;pM4 the space between earth and sky has already been named, and the mention of Chaos would on Kirk- Raven's view of its location be unnecessary. But though the argument is not therefore decisive, it cannot be proved mistaken, and the interpre- tation of the text implied in it remains possible. The point raised in (,+) is a difficult one. It is not demonstrable from 700 that 70Iff. present an account of the line referring to Chaos (7oo) rather than of the whole scene. So the look and sound as of a clash between earth and sky could refer to the whole scene: as a part of such a scene the burning of the unlit subterranean regions would not be as drastically inappropriate as Kirk-Raven would have us believe. After all, if earth and sky clash to- I KR p. 3 I n. i; contrast Schwabl Weltschopfung i49Sff. 2 KR p. 27. 3 See LSJ s.v. * See Rzach, ed. maior. ad. loc. '9</page><page sequence="20">gether the impact might be expected to disturb the whole universe, including the parts below the earth, perhaps to the extent of creating a fire there. Hlscher,I in support of the assumption that the underworld is meant by Chaos here, has adduced the previous description of the Titan onslaught before Zeus showed his full strength, at 678ff. There the sound of the missile reaches Tartarus as the climax of a picture of the effect on the whole universe. But such parallels as this can never be convincing without a demonstration, which normally rests on a petitio principii, that the two passages are necessarily to be regarded as closely parallel; pace Holscher, we have no particular reason to believe that 678ff. was intended as strictly parallel in all respects to 69gff. Chaos makes a good climax to one passage, as Tartarus to the other; but that need not imply that they are located in the same place. On the grounds that, notwithstanding the arguments adduced above, the space between earth and sky is dramatically more appropriate than the underworld for the scene of a clash between earth and sky and for its side-effects, I incline, with some misgivings, to accept Kirk-Raven's argument (4). It is somewhat more likely that the poet of this passage - I know of no adequate reason for not calling him Hesiod - regarded Chaos as situated between earth and sky. Strictly speaking, however, one should say that he probably regarded at least an important part of Chaos as situated there, since there is no emphasis in 69gff. on the whole of Chaos being affected. Some support for this view of the matter may be forthconming from the Oriental and Greek parallels for an original separation of earth and sky. The reader may be referred to Kirk-Raven2 for some details of these. The Hesiodic Chaos may be influenced by these, for Vlastos'3 argument, that it is absurd to make Hesiod speak of the separation of earth and sky when just about to record their coming-to-be, is not fully convincing. Homer and Hesiod, as argued in the first half of this paper, were quite capable of mingling more than one myth or version of a myth in the same passage, without showing any sign of awareness of inconsistency, and without effacing all traces of the join. The Oriental parallels are not without importance in themselves, but for the present purposes they may be described merely as lending additional weight to the fact that Bacchylides, of course an Ionian, could in the fifth century refer to an eagle as flying in 'unharvested Chaos'. This passage may have been the inspiration of Euripides' and Aristophanes' adoption of the I Hermes, LXXXI, I953, p. 400. 2 KR pp. 32ff. 3 Gnomon Vol. XXVII, 1955, p. 74, n. 2. 20</page><page sequence="21">same location for Chaos, as Kirk and Raven suggest. Aristophanes may well be indulging his sense of humour, but there is no reason to suppose that Euripides was being anything but serious. But these passages do not prove, as has often been supposed, that Bacchylides located Chaos, sim- pliciter, between earth and sky: what they do prove is that he thought of at least an important part of Chaos as situated there. It seems most proba- ble, though not susceptible of direct proof, that Bacchylides was drawing on a tradition of lonia which went back ultimately either to Hesiod or to Hesiod's Oriental antecedents. If the phrase 'in unharvested Chaos' used by Bacchylides is 'poetical and perhaps original', that does nothing to show that the ideas contained in it were either original or solely poetic. The conclusion of this argument, admittedly not a certain conclusion, is that Hesiod and his Archaic and Classical successors placed Chaos both above and below the earth. To this may be added that Hesiod or (less probably) one of this successors placed the origin of the cosmic masses in the far West. This would make Chaos surround the earth, as &amp;yp surrounds the earth in the cosmogonies of Anaximander and Anaximenes. I Wherever located, one thing may be said of the Hesiodic Chaos which can probably not be said of the Unlimited of Anaximander; it was an actual present existing entity in the developed world, within the confines of the present cosmos. If the close association of it with the Chasm of 740 is correct, it had the function of limiting at one point the four cosmic masses mentioned in that passage. But this does not imply that it was outside the universe. It is, even within its function as a limit, not described as beyond the edges of the world-masses; and at 700 it is clearly intended as a part of the world, at a stage of the world's existence long after the completion of the cosmogonical process. Some further properties of Chaos may be deduced from the text of Hesiod. Kirk and Raven accept that the genealogy at the beginning of the Theogony implies a dark and gloomy Chaos. A probable interpo- lation in the Theogony shows that a post-Hesiodic rhapsode agreed with this view; at 814 we find the phrase ne'pjv X&amp;eo4 CocppoZo. A further attribute that may with probability be applied to the Hesiodic Chaos is internal motion. The chasm that forms the source of the world-masses at 736ff. is described at 742f. as swept by storm on storm. The relation of this phenomenon to the 'eternal motion' of the lonians will be discussed below. Next must be broached the question of the divinity of I See pp. iof. and 12f. above. 2 1</page><page sequence="22">Chaos. Admittedly no-one ever heard of Chaos being worshipped in ritual, except (possibly) by a few eccentrics. But this of course does not dispose of the matter. Vlastos' suggested that the function of Chaos as the limit and source of the divine Earth and Sky was evidence of its divinity. But this seems to the present writer a non sequitur. The same scholar adduced Theogony 700, xa5ucx a' OEOtnL0V X&amp;zx?V 'og, but until it can be proved that the epithet Osacmtr6ov is to be taken with xaoq rather than with xx5cLc, this evidence must remain suspect.2 R. Mondolfo3 adduced in this connection the question at the end of Hesiod's proem, where the poet invites the Muses to say of the gods 6 rt 7tp&amp;)TOV yCve' ouTv. The question is followed at once by the answer that Chaos was the first to come-to-be. Theogony ii , containing the question, was athetized by Rzach, following the ancient critics Seleucus4 and Aristar- chus. But Rzach did not adduce any other evidence then the mere opinion of these critics, mainly of Aristarchus; and it is never safe to accept such opinions from the Alexandrian critics without their reasons, which were liable to be far-fetched. There is no apparent reason known to us why the line in question should be bracketed, and in default of such reason it should be retained with the mediaeval Mss. This granted, Mondolfo's argument is hard to resist. It might be countered with the observation that a large number of superlatives are used in Classical Greek with a genitive of comparative rather than of partitive force. But of this number 7trpro is not one. LSJ, s.v. 7rpo'rpoq B 1 3 d tell us that a comparative force of 7rpC5Toq is late Greek. It would be extra- ordinary indeed if such an extension of a well known usage were to be found in Hesiod, and imitated but once in the near-quotation by Epi- charmus5 (?), only to disappear completely till the first century A.D. In a poet of Hesiod's date - or anything like as early - the use of 7rpCrov in such a context must be held to imply that Chaos was itself one of the group indicated by the genitive. That is to say that Chaos was divine. Any lingering suspicion that so obviously neuter an individual as Chaos cannot be divine must be confessed irrational, and cannot stand against Mondolfo's argument; Erebos is equally neuter in grammatical gender I Gnomon, loc. cit. 2 Solmsen (SIFC 24 (I 9 50) p. 2 37, n. i) writes: "What matters is that any ancient reader could consider eoa7rkatov as epithet of X&amp;o4". But what matters to us is that we have no proof that any ancient reader did so despite LEp-9v rX6ya (692) and ?oR &amp;a7rtroq (697f.). 3 L'Infinito nel Pensiero dell'Antichita Classica (Firenze 1956) pp. S3 n.

(The fact that Chaos is never expressly said to take part in sexual generation is not relevant.) The most probable view of the text is that Chaos is divine. Another property of Chaos, if the latter was as closely associated with the Chasm as was argued above, was immensity of size. This much is clear whichever way one takes the description of the Chasm, whether as definite or indefinite in magnitude (Theog. 740-I). In any case, the great size of Chaos is implicit in Theog. 69gff., where it is treated on a par with the other world-masses. Finally, it should probably be thought that Chaos in Hesiod is one stuff, that it is substantially and qualitatively homogeneous.' H. Frinkelz has pointed out that Ovid's Chaos, a confused mass of all kinds of stuff, is not a creation of the archaic period. The tendency in the archaic period is to regard the cosmic masses as each more or less homogeneous in substance. Further, only one quality corresponding to a Presocratic 'quality- thing' is predicated of Chaos or of the Chasm in Hesiod, the property of darkness. There is no hint in Hesiod of any strife between different substances in Chaos, nor even of the presence of different substances. The storms in the Chasm are easily understood as the result not of mixture but of motion. Strife is not apparent in Hesiod's world until at least one generation of anthropomorphic gods has appeared on the scene. Appended is a brief summary-list of the qualities and properties that can probably be attributed to Hesiod's Chaos. (i) Chaos in the developed world and therefore presumably also in the cosmogony surrounds the earth. (2) It is therefore a persistent entity within the world. (3) Chaos is in internal motion; no beginning of this motion is mentioned. (4.) Chaos is dark and gloomy. (g) Chaos, though not worshipped, is divine. (6) Chaos is immensely large. (7) Chaos is one single stuff, without mixture. (b) Air in Anaximenes. The relationship between Chaos and the Air of Anaximenes may be established by an examination of the properties of Air, and a comparison of them with those just attributed to Chaos. The first question to be I Solmsen (SIFC loc. cit. p. 248) makes more of &amp;ieE-nq (738) than the assignment of all the lrYby&amp;L to Tartarus admits. 2 Ovid: a Poet between Two Worlds (Berkeley 1945) p. 209 n. 6. 23</page><page sequence="24">discussed is the location of Air in the cosmogony and cosmology of Anaximenes. At stage (2) in the table of these cosmogonies given above, Anaximenes has Air and Earth together, as Hesiod had Chaos and Earth. Furthermore, as Chaos surrounds the earth, so does Air in Anaximenes. We are told by Aristotle that Anaximenes believed the earth to be supported by Air, and that places Air below the earth: and if Anaximenes did not believe that there was Air above the earth as well, then his system was a most peculiar one. Moreover, there is a strong and obvious a priori case for supposing that Air thus situated was regarded as within the confines of our universe, again like the Hesiodic Chaos. It is true that Aeftius, tells us, purporting to quote Anaximenes, that Air surrounds the whole cosmos: but even if this be true - and the sentence concerned, even if it contains Anaximenean elements, has certainly been re-written by Aetius or his source - this does not disprove the location of a large portion of Air within the cosmos. If Anaximenes did believe in a body of his primary stuff surrounding the cosmos, he was probably in this respect following in Anaximander's footsteps; but that did not apparent- ly prevent him from following Hesiod at the same time, in making the original stuff an integral part of the present world. The influence of Thales should also be allowed for, since Thales' original stuff, if water was in his philosophy an original stuff, was also a part of the actually existing world. But having seen already that Anaximenes made use, inde- pendently of Anaximander, of Anaximander's Hesiodic source, we may find it hard to credit that Thales' was the only influence here at work. A point which makes the influence of Hesiod more readily discernible is the probable darkness, in some degree, of Anaximenes' Air, compa- rable with the gloom associated with the Hesiodic Chaos. But this statement demands some justification. I shall argue below that though Anaximander had an inkling of the distinction between atmospheric air and mist, he almost certainly used the word a&amp;-Ip to denote the latter. This, the common Greek usage in the Archaic period, raises a strong presumption that Anaximenes used the word in a similar sense. If he had not done so, then without some explanation he would have risked serious misunderstanding. But Kirk,z notwithstanding this strong pre- sumption, has argued for the interpretation of Anaximenes' o&amp; p as atmospheric air. It is admitted that the assumption of the substantiality II, 3, 4 ap. DK I3B2. I KR p. 146. Cp. Guthrie op. cit. p. 128; Guthrie p. 3 in., on the 'fragment', makes insufficient allowance for its accumulation of odd things. 24</page><page sequence="25">of atmospheric air would be remarkable in Anaximenes' day: but the assumption seems in some respects less remarkable than Kirk supposes,' so this argument will not here be used ad hominem. There are two main arguments against the view that Anaximenes' air possessed the main properties of mist. (i) Anaximenes probably said that all things were surrounded by breath and air, and that the soul is related to this air. (2) Anaximenes evidently held that the winds are formed from a slightly condensed form of air. With respect to the first argunment, some scep- ticism seems to be called for. The 'fragment' of Anaximenes, on which it is based, has admittedly undergone some re-writing, and we are to-day in no position to check on the extent of that re-writing. Even if the 'fragment' had been correctly reported by Aeius, Kirk's argument here would not carry full conviction. As is well known, primitive thought in general and Greek thought in particular closely associated breath and soul. In even moderately cold weather the exhaled breath is visible as mist: and the well-known Homeric and popular view that the soul is, in its separate state, not merely visible but recognizable, implies that it was more opaque than 'atmospheric air' as we use that term. Kirk admits, moreover, that the relationship between soul and air in the fragment must remain uncertain, and that no reliance can be placed on the actual wording of Aetius' statement. It follows that the possibility arises of Anaximenes having qualified Air in relation to the soul in some such way as Hippolytus suggests in his account of the winds in Anaximan- der.2 The second argument is somewhat more persuasive. From the condensation of air to form the winds and the intermediate position of winds between air and cloud, Kirk and Raven deduce that 'air' means 'atmospheric air'. But this seems to assume that the criterion by which Anaximenes judged the position of the substances on the scale of conden- sation and rarefaction was nothing other than transparency or brightness, and we have no evidence and no a priori probability that this was the case at all points of the scale. If k')p meant 'mist', of a density like that of a morning mist, then it might well be held that this is less dense than the winds which appear to blow it away, or the clouds which the sun takes so much longer on occasion to dispel. The physical impact of a wind is more forcible than that of a mist, and the physical impact of, say, a thunder-cloud is something that Anaximenes could not test directly, but which he might well imagine from its appearance to be heavier than I Evidently the Milesians believed in the substantiality of winds, despite their in- visibility. Pace Guthrie p. I24 n. i, winds are sensible, even if invisible. 2 Ref. I, 6, 7 DK X 2A i x, trv Xe To-r&amp;rov X -r0V a' poq.. 25</page><page sequence="26">either wind or mist. The argument is therefore not conclusive. Nor does it become so by the addition of a reference to an odd passage of Hippo- lytus. Kirk' suggests that this passage is interpolated with non-Theo- phrastean 'interpretation', and as it is without doxographical parallel and contains at least one contradiction this is by no means unlikely. I borrow Kirk's translation; "Anaximenes ... said that infinite air was the principle, from which the things that are becoming, and that are, and that shall be, and gods and things divine, all come into being, and the rest from its products. The form of air is of this kind: whenever it is most equable it is invisible to sight, but is revealed by the cold and the hot and the damp and by movement. It is always in motion, for things that change do not change unless there be motion. " The contrast between (i) the notion of an air that when "equable" is not visible, but becomes visible by movement, and (2) the portrayal of it as always in motion is piquant. Since it is reasonably certain that Theophrastus attributed eternal motion to the Milesians, it seems most likely that the statement which prima facie contradicts this is non-Theophrastean or at any rate non-cosmogonical. This is no doubt what Kirk and Raven intend the reader to suppose when they describe the reference to invisible atmos- pheric air as an assumption of Hippolytus2: and an assumption of Hippolytus about Anaximenes could be worth no more than the paper it is written on. It will be argued below that Theophrastus may be believed when he attributes 'eternal motion' to the Milesians' primary substance; and if this is so then the notion that Anaximenes' cosmogonical Air was in the 'equable' state of Hippolytus loses at once all its plausibility. What needs further investigation at this point is the exact sense which the word a&amp;p had in the Archaic period. The best discussion of this question that is known to me is that of P. Louis.3 This scholar has shown that &amp;np, derived from the same root as ocp,4 means by etymology 'something suspended'. At a pinch and in certain contexts it could admittedly be used by Homer and his early successors where opacity and darkness in an absolute sense are not intended. On a passage from the Iliad Louis remarks; "Par opposition a ot'6np, qui de'signe l'espace superieur, la partie claire de l'atmosphZere, M'p designe la partie infe- rieure, celle qu'assombrit souvent une brume plus ou moins opaque." I KR p. i45. 2 Kahn op. cit. p. i is over-optimistic about this passage, despite Hippolytus' usual accuracy. 3 Revue de Philologie 3e Ser. Vol. 22 (1948) pp. 63ff. 4 Cp. Meillet, Bulletin de Ia Societe de Linguistique Vol. XXVI (1925) pp. 7ff. 26</page><page sequence="27">Due note should be taken of the degrees of opacity allowed, and of the word 'souvent', not 'toujours'. It must be admitted that to Homer and subsequent writers &amp;ap was not always or necessarily an actual mist. But nevertheless this is its 6th-century connotation,' and unless used in such a context or with such a qualification as to exclude such a meaning, 'mist' is the sense which the word would normally bear. At the least &amp;4Jp denotes something with which mist is often associated, and in speaking of a cosmogonical primary stuff whose creation ex nihilo is not thought of, the difference between 'often associated with mist' and 'misty' is tenuous. We do not know the precise context in which the word &amp;"p was introduced by Anaximenes, and we have no evidence from his own hand to tell us whether he so qualified the word as to exclude the notion of mist. In default of such knowledge the matter cannot be finally settled. But so sharp a distinction between Anaximander and his near-con- temporary as a fundamental difference in their use of the word &amp;-qp demands more justification than has yet been offered. Some indirect evidence is available which suggests that &amp;7p was in the mind of Anaximenes associated with darkness. That is in the description of the earth as floating on air. It is most improbable that Anaximenes should have believed the space below the earth to be filled with some- thing that is not dark. It may be observed that Anaximenes apparently did not even hold the plausible view that the sun passes under the earth from West to East and so illumines the underworld at night. We are told by Hippolytus2 that the heavenly bodies in Anaximenes' cos- mology were supposed to move round the earth as a felt cap turns round a human head, and were rendered invisible to human sight not by disappearing below the earth but by passing behind the higher parts of the earth to the North. Under the earth was perpetual darkness. Concluding that the balance of probability is in favour of the suppo- sition that Anaximenes' air was conceived of as a mist, as something dark and opaque, we turn next to the question of the 'eternal motion'. It is often supposed that Theophrastus has, in attributing to the Milesians a belief in the eternal motion of their primary stuff, reduced an assumption, perhaps unspoken, to a Peripatetic formula. The language in which Theophrastus3 expresses the attribution is often put into Peripatetic At Xenophanes B28.i 'i pL (Diels' certain emendation for xocx p') is predominantly local in sense, a natural development from passages such as Iliad XIV 288 where the sense is partly but not mainly local. (Contra, Kahn op. cit. pp. 14sf.). 2 Ref. 1, 7, 6, DK. x3 A7. 3 The Theophrastean origin of the doxographical reports is shown by the agreement of Simplicius in Phys. 24.31 (DK 13 A _) and Hippolytus (DK X I A7). 27</page><page sequence="28">terminology. But that by no means proves that the Milesians did not express this view in un-Peripatetic language. In Anaxirnenes' case, the constant mobility of Air in its present state - whether one interprets it as mist or atmospheric air - affords, as Kirk' saw, evidence to make plausible a belief in perpetual movement. It may be added that few would now doubt that matter at the Milesian stage of Greek thought was naively considered to be alive and capable of moving itself.2 The dis- tinction between potential and actual was not, of course, known to the Milesians, and something perpetually capable of motion would probably have seemed to them to be perpetually in motion. The distinction, if it had momentarily occurred to them, would probably have been dismissed as of little importance. But in any case, the question whether the motion of the primary stuff was strictly eternal need not here concern us. There is no more direct evidence for eternal motion of Hesiod's Chasm than there is for eternity of motion in the Milesians. That both were in constant internal motion there is no reason to deny; the text of Hesiod and the statement of Theophrastus are sufficient evidence for an antecedent probability. The problem next requiring attention is that of the divinity of Air. There is admittedly on this point a shortage of evidence, but no more so than for Anaximenes' views in general. Such evidence as there is set out by Kirk. 3 Kahn4 has pointed out that the agreement of Cicero and Aetius on the point is insufficient to prove that Theophrastus attributed divinity to Anaximenes' Air; the confusion of the one source and the Stoicizing interpretation of the other render thenm almost useless at this point. What we do know is that Theophrastus said that gods came from Air; now the main cosmic masses, including presumably the air around us, came from Air, and if these were divine then it seenms wholly unreasonable that the original Air should not have been divine too; it is also to be observed that we have no proof that Theophrastus did not say it was. It does not therefore seem probable that Anaximenes was an exception to Aristotle's generalisation at Phys. 4, 203b7ff., that most of the physicists believed their original stuff to be divine. A further property to be associated in all probability with Anaximenes' Air is immense size. This much seems to be implied by Theophrastus when he attributes the epithet X7tCSpov, as applied to Air, to Anaximenes. But this argument introduces a controversial topic in the shape of &amp;7TZLpOV, I KR p. 147. 2 The term 'hylozoism' is now unfashionable, but see now Guthrie op. cit. pp. 62ft. 3 KR p. iSo. 4 Op. cit. pp. 48f. 28</page><page sequence="29">and it is perhaps safer to rely on common sense, which suggests that something perhaps surrounding the world and certainly the source of the whole world is unlikely to be other than vast. I Qualitative homogeneity, or (what amounts at this date to the same thing) substantial homogeneity, is a further property which can with some confidence be attributed to Anaximenes' Air. There is no sug- gestion in any of our sources that Air is a mixture - though admittedly any argument from silence in the case of Anaximenes is more than usually perilous. But in this case we have no reason to suppose that Air was a mixture. Despite its power to produce both clouds and winds there is no sign that anyone before Anaxagoras, who had his own special reasons for this belief, held that Air was a mixture of different substances. The most that Anaximenes is likely to have accepted is that Air is composed of parts, some more or less dense than others, and even that would be to go beyond what our evidence tells us. Aristotle and Theo- phrastus appear to have ranked Anaximenes squarely among the monists - though this kind of statement in the Peripatetics is not necessarily reliable.2 The Presocratics in general, until compelled by the logic of Parmenides, do not seem to have inquired closely into the physical constitution of the cosmic masses, being probably content with the suppo- sition that each was to all intents and purposes one massive piece of one stuff. The result of this investigation of the attributes likely to be applicable to Anaximenes' Air is that every single one of the attributes mentioned above is shared by Air in Anaximenes and Chaos in Hesiod. The qualities concerned are, to sum up, as follows. (i) Location - surrounding the earth. (2) Persistence within the developed world. (3) Darkness. (4) Internal motion. (g) Divinity. (6) Immense size. (7) Probable homogeneity. I It is not necessary here to argue the difficult problem of the denotation and connota- tions of &amp;TreLpov. See KR pp. Io4ff., and Guthrie pp. 8 3ff. 2 In this connection it is of interest that for the process whereby Air gives rise to the cosmic masses no word such as rxxpveOOcsoL is used which would imply a mixture in the original Air. Theophrastus (cp. Hippolytus ap. DK A7, Aetius ap. DK B2, Cicero ap. DK Ag) doubtless used the phrase &amp;' ocvy-ro5 y4veaOoct, or something very similar, and (cp. Hippolytus loc. cit. with Simplicius ap. DK As and Augustine ap. DK Axo) may have used the word &amp;k6yovoL or a similar metaphor for the things derived from Air. 29</page><page sequence="30">This summary-list may be compared with that of the properties of Chaos on p. 23 above. (c) The Unlimited of Anaximander. Of the seven properties which we have found to be shared in all probability by the Hesiodic Chaos and the Anaximenean Air the first three should probably not be associated with Anaximander's Unlimited, whereas the balance of probability is in favour of attributing to it the last four in the list. Detailed justification of this statement will be found below. The discussion is by no means intended as a complete analysis of all the problems raised by the word &amp;{stpov and the various descriptions in the ancient sources of the body denoted by it in Anaxi- mander. Nor will a full description of Anaximander's complicated account of the universe be attempted here; the present writer finds none of the descriptions in the main modern authorities wholly con- vincing, but cannot suggest one which is completely free of difficulties. The best discussions of Anaximander's cosnmos and the place of the Unlimited in it seem to be those of Burnet, Kirk, Cornford and Kahn. What is said here on the Unlimited is intended to be consistent with any of these. On the location of the Unlimited there can be little doubt of the negative point that it does not surround the earth in close proximity to it, but surrounds the whole universe - and the other universes if there are any. It is outside our cosmos, and does not persist as an entity within it. There is evidence that the Milesians held that their primary substance surrounded the universe; and it is in the highest degree improbable that Anaximander combined this view, as did Anaximenes, with the location of a portion of the same stuff around the earth. Once again there is no evidence for such a combination in Anaximander: and there is some indirect evidence against it. It seems likely that, whether or not Anaximander used the word &amp;7retpov to mean 'qualitatively' indefinite', he used so vague a term with the implication that his primary stuff was not one of the cosmic masses. Obviously enough, if it had been equatable with one of them he could have used its name; and it is clear that he did not. Then so large and important a body as the Unlimited could hardly be squeezed into any nook or cranny left between the cosmic masses. It is not the Unlimited but iqp which surrounds the earth in proximity to it in Anaximander's cosmogony. So though the Unlimited probably persists after the process of cosmogony is over, it does not do so within the world, and does not surround earth like Air in the 30</page><page sequence="31">cosmology of Anaximenes. Nor is it likely that Anaximander believed his Unlimited to be dark. Had he done so, there was then no point in not giving it the name &amp;np. This remains so, whether or not the word &amp;7retpov means 'qualitatively indeterminate'. In respect therefore of the first three attributes in the lists given above, Anaximander deserted the Hesiodic account of the originative body where Anaximenes more probably followed it. Theophrastus (witness Simplicius ap.DK.Ag and Hippolytus ap.DK. AI i) postulated an eternal motion of the Unlimited, and with the proviso that there is some reason for doubting its absolute eternity there is no sound argument for rejecting this statement. Whether Anaximander had in mind, as is often supposed, some particular kind of motion is more doubtful. If one were compelled to choose, then some form of circular motion would be the most plausible,' to account for the circular motion of the heavenly bodies, but this may have been a property of the 'productive' rather than of the Unlimited. Without some motion it would be difficult to account for the start of the cosmogonical process, an argument which applies more forcibly to Anaxiniander than to Anaxi- menes, since Anaximander had no such definite process in mind as condensation and rarefaction; whereas condensation and rarefaction can be conceived as beginning without some motion to start them off - unlikely though such a conception is for the sixth century B.C. - a process of separation seems to demand some such adjunct to make it plausible. As always, however, the possibility must be borne in mind that Anaximander may have held implausible views. There remains the point that to Anaximander as well as to Anaximenes the primary stuff was doubtless always alive2 and capable of motion; and if capable, then probably constantly in motion. It is not determinable whether either of them specified that this was so; each may have never given a specific answer to the question whether motion can be said to have started at any given moment. But this does not mean that either held that it did start at a given moment. More probably e.ach held that motion was indefiriitely old, just as each most probably held that the primary stuff was indefinitely large. For the divinity of the Unlimited we have the evidence not only, as in the case of Anaximenes, of doxographers but also of Aristotle.3 When Aristotle declares of the Unlimited: 'And this is the divine; I Cp. Heidel and Cornford's views rebutted by Kahn op. cit. p. 235 nn. 2 For the divinity of the Unlimited see below. 3 Phys. 4, 203b6ff. 3 '</page><page sequence="32">for it is deathless and indestructible, as Anaximander says with most of the physical thinkers' he is surely to be believed. One may also believe that the term &amp;y4'pw in Hippolytus' account' should be added to Anaxi- mander's terminology. Such terms as these are not normally in Greek applied to beings not divine,2 and if Anaximander used them then he implied the divinity of the Unlimited, whether or not he chose to be explicit about it. With respect to the immense size of Anaximander's Unlimited, similar considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, as to the Air of Anaxime- nes. If the Unlimited surrounds the cosmos, then it must be thought of as indefinitely large. In any case the source of the whole cosmos is most plausibly regarded as vast. The word &amp;7rt=pov may have indicated primarily or secondarily indefinite extent, but that need not be discusse(d here. Whether the Unlimited was homogeneous or a mixture is a much disputed point; H. Cherniss3 and G. Vlastos4 follow Heidel in holding that it was, where Kirks and Kahn6 argue the contrary. The present writer sides with those who doubt that the Unlimited was a mixture. Kirk seems right in accepting from U. Holscher that Anaximander did not talk of opposites being separated out but rather of their separation off from the Unlimited. It follows that, if they were not separated out, there is no good reason to suppose they were 'in' the Unlimited to start with. It is doubtful whether the Unlimited was being even unconsciously, as Kirk suggests, treated as unhomogeneous - but discussion of such a point is necessarily somewhat rarefied. It is a less abstruse point that convinces the present writer; if the Unlimited was a mixture, then it was unique among the scientific or quasi-scientific primary substances of pre-Parmenidean Greece. There is no historical reason why any cos- mogonist should postulate an initial mixture before Parmenides produced arguments from which it could be inferred that to derive a varied world from a homogeneous beginning was to violate the laws of Being.7 I Ref.

A summary of the results of this section is given below. Properties NOT possessed by the Unlimited of Anaximander: (i) Location immediately surrounding the earth. (2) Persistence within the developed world. (3) Darkness. Properties POSSESSED by the Unlimited of Anaximander: ( I) Internal motion. (5) Divinity. (6) Immense size. (7) Homogeneity. This table may be compared with those on pp. 23 and 29 above. (d) Conclusion. At Theogony 736ff. the Chasm, which we have seen reason to associate closely with Chaos, is described as the source of the earth, the sea, the sky with the heavenly bodies, and of 'misty Tartarus'. If, with Vlastos', we take seriously the epithet rlepo6t applied to Tartarus, we have, in rudimentary form, the doctrine that Chaos is the source of the four elements, as they were later to be called. The suggestion, despite the wavering in Hesiod between Tartarus as an appendage of Earth and Tartarus as a separate entity, is attractive. But Vlastos, by concen- trating on the resemblances between Hesiod and Anaximander, has missed the still closer parallel between Hesiod and Anaximenes. For if the Chasm is located, in a sense, within Tartarus, and therefore Chaos includes at least part of Tartarus, then Hesiod, like Anaximenes, has made part at least of one of the world-masses into the source of them all. In Anaximenes as in Hesiod the source of all the cosmic masses is possessed of at least one quality (mistiness) and other properties in common with one of them, which it does not possess in the cosmogony of Anaximander. I Gnomon loc. cit. 33</page><page sequence="34">It looks as if Anaximander may well have been following Hesiod or Hesiod's source when he postulated an early stage of cosmogony in which mist surrounded the earth, and continued his cosmogony in the way outlined earlier in this paper. But he went beyond Hesiod when he placed outside the cosmos the original source of all that exists. He was going still further beyond Hesiod, and perfbrming indeed a tre- mendous feat of abstraction, when he posited a source of no definite "'quality-substance." But he had to pay for his triumph of abstract thought with a loss of empirical justification. Anaximenes went back to the Hesiodic view that one of the existing world-masses, and that the dark one, was the source of the world. Anaximenes may have been partly influenced by Thales at this point; but the original stuff in Anaximenes bears more resemblance to Hesiod's Chasm and Chaos than to Thales' water. Anaximenes may also have been influenced by the stage in the cosmogony of Anaximander at which mist surrounds the earth; he may have fastened on to this and neglected the more abstract notion of the Unlimited. But in view of the widespread knowledge of Hesiod in Anaximenes' day and homeland and in view of the apparent direct borrowing from the Hesiodic tradition at a later stage of his cosmogony, it is not too fanciful to suppose that the Hesiodic cosmogony was in his mind when he thought out the initial stages of his own. At the beginning as at a later stage of Anaximenes' cosmogony we find inde- pendence in conservatism.' The University of Edinburgh. I Schwabl (op. cit.) makes it appear likely that if any Oriental ideas impinged on the early stages of Anaximander's or Anaximenes' cosmogony they came from or through the Phoenician cosmogony. Epimenides may have affected Anaximenes, but see Guthrie P. 39. I find that Prof. Guthrie p. 134 anticipates my observation that Anaximenes' derivation of heavenly bodies from the earth resembles Hesiod Theogony 126-7; but since I have argued the point in more detail and differed on some topics I have let my text (especially p. I4) stand with only slight revision. Since I was so fortunate as to attend Prof. Guthrie's lectures at Cambridge I can only hope that the absence of the point from my notes indicates its recent date rather than my carelessness; otherwise the credit is all his. 34</page></plain_text>
