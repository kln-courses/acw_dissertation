ANALOGY AND THE RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS * A FTER describing a form in which difficulties with the cog- nitive significance of religious discourse have been presented recently, I shall sketch a general "analogy of meaning" hypothesis for natural language and indicate how that hypothesis may lead to the resolution of such cognitivity difficulties while avoiding both noncognitivist and nonliteralist interpretations of religious discourse. I. A RECENT FORM OF THE DIFFICULTY OVER THE COGNITIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE 1. A Change in Form. Discussion of the cognitive (as distinct from emotive, evocative, or expressive) meaningfulness of discourse about God and about the relationships of man and God has advanced with the recognition that the philosophical difficulties are not really centered upon the verifiability, falsifiability, confirmability, or empirical testability of religious statements, but rather upon their continuity of meaning (or lack of it) with discourse environments whose cognitive significance is not sensibly to be questioned. W. P. Alston, for instance, indicating that in religious discourse terms like 'wise', 'good', and 'person', are applicable to God only if certain sorts of action terms, like 'does', 'makes', 'creates', 'knows', 'forgives', and so forth, are also applicable, argues that in religious discourse the latter are used in ways that differ significantly from the ways in which those terms are used in empirically more accessible contexts 1: * To be presented in an APA symposium on the Philosophy of Religion, Decem- ber 28, 1970; other speakers will be George I.

Reese and Eugene Freeman, eds., The Hartshorne Festschrift: Process and Divin- ity (LaSalle, Ill.: Open Court, 1964), pp. 429-443. 725</page><page sequence="2">726 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY . . . the objective reference of God-sentences is borrowed from the prior application of their predictive terms to human beings (431). . . . Thus we get, and must get the terms we apply to God from our talk about men . . . in talk about God these terms no longer have their primary or literal meaning; their sense as well as their applica- tion has shifted (432). . .. Any theological use of a word is derivative from a non-theological use of some word; derivative just in the sense that the former cannot be taught without employing the latter (435). . . . The basic trouble is that in removing overt behavior from forgiving, commanding, etc. (and even more if we remove temporal sequence too) we have taken these terms out of the language game in which they primarily function without replacing it with another. In etherealizing these action concepts we snip off the rules which normally govern their use (440). In consequence of transporting terms from epistemically prior environments to religious-discourse environments where the mean- ings are altered, we are left unclear as to just what conditions of application hold for these terms, and, supposedly, if we want to elucidate their senses, we shall have to perform a more careful analysis of the ways such terms are used in particular cases of re- ligious discourse. (This is Alston's conclusion, 442-443; he does not draw noncognitivist consequences from the difficulty he has described.) A challenge to the cognitive significance of religious discourse can be based on such premises, however.2 It would suggest that, when 2 By 'cognitively significant' here, I mean that an expression is cognitively sig- nificant or cognitively meaningful if it would be appropriate for the speaker or hearer to adopt a positive epistemic attiude toward it, to believe it, doubt it, disbelieve it, know it to be true, and so forth. John Smith in "The Present Status of Natural Theology," this JOURNAL LV, 22 (Oct. 23, 1958): 925-936, describes a "discontinuity thesis" favored by the Barthians and by many Protestant theologians: that there is no epistemic path- way from the world we know to the knowledge of God; the linguistic-discon- tinuity hypothesis described here is simply a generalization of that idea to a semantic counterpart. I do not think that Hare, Smart, McPherson, Braith- waite, Hepburn, and MacIntyre would abandon their noncognitivist inter- pretations of religious discourse if they found that our understanding of verifi- ability, falsifiability, or confirmation had so weakened as to allow religious dis- course to pass such tests; their conviction against the cognitivity of religious discourse is probably stronger than their conviction for the cognitivity criteria they have employed; they could then be expected to broaden their challenge by adopting some form of the discontinuity challenge. Kai Nielsen still insists that an empirical-confirmability test must be faced and will be failed by God-statements, cf. "On Believing that God Exists," Southern Journal of Philosophy, v, 3 (Fall 1967): 167-172. Yet the article Nielsen dis- cusses, Norman Malcolm's "Is It a Religious Belief that 'God Exists'?" in John</page><page sequence="3">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 727 you transport a term from a context where its conditions of applica- bility are well understood, its implications are definite, etc., and relocate it in an environment where those conditions are certainly changed but are not well understood, you have or may have evacuated the cognitive significance of the term and may have transferred that effect deleteriously to the whole expression in which the term occurs. Religious discourse is a characteristically alien en- vironment for terms with empirical signification. 2. Similarity to the Medieval Dispute. Alston's description of the difficulty brings the discussion full circle to a state remarkably simi- lar to the thirteenth-century beginnings of the cognitivity dispute, when it was proposed that the terms applied to God are all equivocal with respect to their creature-applications.3 Both the medieval equivocation hypothesis and Alston's description of the problem may be regarded as complementary particularized statements of a general linguistic discontinuity hypothesis concerning religious Hick, ed., Faith and the Philosophers (New York: St. Martin's, 1964), pp. 103- 110, already has moved from exclusive concentration upon empirical confirma- tion to considering that religious concepts "have a grip on the world" in ways to which "questions of confirmation and disconfirmation" are not relevant (Nielsen, p. 171). Even Nielsen seems prepared to adopt a discontinuity hypothesis, while maintaining that "claims must be open to some possible confirmation or discon- firmation" [p. 203 of "Wittgensteinian Fideism," Philosophy, XLII, 161 (July 1967)]; for he quotes, apparently with approval, G. E. Hughes' description of his and Martin's position as follows: "On my approach and on Martin's approach the fact that the pattern of usage of a term such as 'God' does not accord with that of other nontheological terms with which it is taken to be analogous, is made a basis for the charge that the use of the term is logically incoherent." [Nielsen's quotation from p. 215 of Hughes' "Martin's Religious Belief," Austra- lasian Journal of Philosophy, LX, 2 (August 1962) on p. 195 of "Wittgensteinian Fideism," loc. cit.]. And in "The Intelligibility of God-Talk," Religious Studies, vi (March 1970): 1-21, Nielsen says: "The skeptic draws attention to the fact that such discourse utilizes terms like 'persons' and 'acts' which are common to more mundane contexts, but that in the religious contexts they function in a different way and that their very use in such religious contexts is thoroughly perplexing to believer and unbeliever alike . . . Thus in a very natural way- independently of some disputable philosophical criterion of meaning-questions concerning their intelligibility naturally arise" (p. 20). 8 For instance, St. Thomas argues against that view in a number of places. In chapter 33 of Contra Gentiles he offers five reasons against the equivocation view; the fifth most clearly indicates his recognition of the noncognitivist conse- quences of the equivocation thesis: that "there is no reason to predicate terms of something unless we increase understanding thereby; if the terms were used equivocally of God, there would be no way to show that God is a being, is good, or anything else." Also in Summa Theologica, Ia,q.13,a.5 corpus he says: Nothing is predicated of God "purely equivocally as some say. Because, on that view, nothing could be known of God from creatures nor demonstrated; but the fallacy of equivocation would always block the way." He takes the same position in Ia,q.13,a.10; q.13,a.5,ad 1 and I Sentences, d,35,q.1.a.4, corpus.</page><page sequence="4">728 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY discourse: that religious discourse is of suspect cognitive significance because there is a discontinuity between the meanings of its char- acteristic terms and the meanings those terms have in other dis- course environments, some of which are, for most people, epis- temically prior. The discontinuity is illustrated nowadays by contrasting the indefiniteness and even contrariety of the conditions of observa- tion, evidence, behavioral expression, term applicability, implica- tion, and of paraphrase which accompany expressions in religious discourse, with the definiteness of certain epistemically prior non- religious discourse environments where the same terms occur. In the thirteenth century the discontinuity was illustrated by a contrast of the metaphysical categories and modes of being of God and creatures, leading to the conclusion that a semantic chasm, equivo- cation, separated talk about God from talk about other things. Just as the medievals considered the hypothesis that equivoca- tion may be the result of the displacement of terms from an ex- periential to a transcendental context, so some philosophers today consider that language "goes on a holiday" or breaks loose from the restraints of meaning-conferring language games when terms are similarly displaced. And just as in the thirteenth century an analogy theory was introduced to provide a via media between the anthropomorphic doctrine of "univocation" and the agnostic (non- cognitivist or nonliteral) doctrine of "equivocation" concerning the divine predicates,4 so now an analogy doctrine may be used to refute the linguistic-discontinuity hypothesis by helping us to show that religious discourse has no infirmity peculiar to it, that its semantic structure is fully incorporated within the general semantic regularity of natural language.5 3. Some Qualifications about the Statement of the Difficulty. Al- ston is right 6 that we do and must "get the terms we apply to God 4 In the thirteenth century it was the transcendence of God which supported the argument that terms like 'wise', 'knows', 'loves', 'acts', 'does', 'causes', and even 'exists' must be used equivocally when applied to God (as compared with other "experiential" human employments). Aquinas took that argument seriously because he held that our only access to the "sense" (as distinct from "formal," linguistic) meanings of expressions in language is through experience, and, if the terms do not have their meaning originating in experience and continuous with it, then religious expressions would be quite literally unintelligible. 5From its medieval beginnings the analogy theory about religious discourse was developed as an alternative to a noncognitivist account. Although the non- cognitivist view was not widely held, it may have had some supporters, for Aquinas denies that the terms are used "purely equivocally, as some say" (Ia,q.l3,a.5, corpus; italics mine). 6 Aquinas argued similarly: Ia,q.13,a.l,ad.</page><page sequence="5">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 729 from our talk about men." (432). But I think we should take "pri- mary" meaning to be person-relative and not delude ourselves into thinking that there can be only one primary meaning a term has for a given person. A primary meaning of t for S is any meaning t has for S that is not learned by S through t's already having some other meaning for S. Thus a term may have several primary mean- ings for S. That accords well with the simple equivocation of such terms as 'fast' in 'fast car', 'fast day', 'bound fast', 'fast color', and 'fast girl'. And there is a difference between primacy of mean- ing for S and priority of meaning for S with respect to some other meaning t has for S. For one meaning t has for S is prior to some other meaning t has for S if the latter is or was learned by S through S's knowledge of the former. Although no meaning of t that is secondary for S may also be a primary meaning of t for S, some meaning of t for S may be primary without being a prior meaning of t for S or being the only primary or prior meaning of t forS.7 There is no reason to assume that, for terms that have many meanings for most persons competent in the language, there is any one meaning that is primary for all persons or any one meaning that is, for all persons, prior to all other senses the term has for each person. With these qualifications we can agree with Alston that "In talk about God these terms no longer have their primary ... mean- ing." 8 But that is simply a general truth and not, as he seems to think, a matter of principle. For it is not impossible that someone should have the divine-predicate sense of 'wise' as a primary sense for him; rather, given our form of life, it is conditionally impossible that everyone should have the divine-predicate senses of such terms as primary. And if S's talk about God makes interpersonal sense (and not accidentally) and yet the divine-predicate senses of some of his terms are their primary senses for him, it must be that S belongs to a discoursing community with other persons for whom these terms do not have primary senses, as described above, in talk about God. Not to disengage the primary senses and literal uses of terms is a mistake. A nonliteral or metaphorical use of a term is not, except 7 While I will not develop the point here because it involves diachronic con- siderations, a different meaning of t for S can be learned by S from some prior meaning t has for S only through some process of derivation; I suggest that those processes are regular and that they are the counterparts of the synchronic regularities to be discussed in this paper. 8 The "omission dots" indicate that I have left "or literal" out of the quota- tion for reasons to be made clear below.</page><page sequence="6">730 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY by stipulation, the same thing as a nonliteral or metaphorical sense of a term. I can understand the latter idea only as a compara- tive, metalinguistic predicate 9 or as a very loose equivalent of 'non- literal or metaphorical use'. It is frequently and mistakenly assumed that metaphorical uses of terms involve changes in the senses of the terms; just the opposite seems to be true. As long as the sense of the term 'lion' remains the same as in (a) 'Leo is a lion in the circus that played here last year', the use of 'lion' in (b) 'General MacArthur was a lion' may be metaphorical with respect to its use in (a); but once the sense of 'lion' in (b) is shifted so that its cate- gories are aligned with those of the subject, 'General MacArthur', the use of 'lion', which would formerly have been metaphorical, becomes literal and becomes equivocal with its use in (a).10 Not only is it incorrect to identify the primary sense and literal meaning in such a way that no derivative meaning will accompany a literal use; it would be even further wrong to suggest that, because both the sense and the application of a pair of same-term occurrences differ, it cannot happen that both members of the pair should be used literally. That would ignore both simple equivocation and meaning derivation, which are to be found in virtually every ex- tended discourse. Thus although we take Alston's description of the difficulty about religious discourse to be astute and sug- gestive, we have to amend his assumptions about primacy and reject the apparent equivalence of "derived" and "nonliteral" uses of same-terms. II. WHAT IS THE ANALOGY HYPOTHESIS? It is a general hypothesis about meaning derivation in natural languages. But we shall consider only the analogy hypothesis for English. The hypothesis will apply to "religious discourse" be- cause it applies to every discourse environment for which natural 9 I have in mind here that, even if the sense of 'lion' were adjusted to the categories of its subject and occurred literally in (b), below in the text, one might still want to say that the meaning of this occurrence of the term as compared with its use in (a) is "metaphorical." Thus we would be indicating that a new sense of the term had arisen, over time, through the metaphorical use of the term in its earlier meaning. See R. A. Hall, Jr., Introductory Lin- guistics (Philadelphia: Chilton Company, 1964), ch. 59, "Changes in Meaning" especially p. 350/1. 10 Thus for t in (b) to be used metaphorically with respect to t in (a) it is neces- sary (but not sufficient) that t in (b) be univocal with t in (a) and that the con- ditions of applicability for t in (a) not all be satisfied for t in (b), though for the statement (b) to be true (as a metaphorical claim) some of the conditions of applicability of t in (a) must be satisfied in (b). Thus, taken literally, a meta- phorical expression must be false, and yet it still has truth conditions that govern the metaphorical expression qua a truth expressed metaphorically.</page><page sequence="7">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 731 language is used, including "physical discourse,' "gambling cdis course," "architectural discourse," and so forth.'1 The analogy hypothesis is as follows: (1) The sets of same-term occurrences to be found within the available corpus of utterances and inscriptions in English almost universally exhibit internal mul- tiplicity of meanings. (2) That multiplicity of meaning is not a manifestation of simple equivocation in most cases (equivocation by chance, a casu), but manifests meaning derivation that results from meaning-differentiation-in-use (meaning differentiation, not by a speaker's design, deliberation or intent, but by semantic con- tagion). (3) The meaning-differentiation-in-use that can be ob- served within sets of same-term occurrences, exhibits certain regu- larities which are to be found in a significant sample of sets of same-term occurrences. (4) These regularities of meaning differen- tiation are synchronic regularities (as distinct from the diachronic regularities which are exhibited in the evolution of language and which in some cases have corresponding synchronic regularities).12 (5) When the regularities exhibited by the meaning-differentiation- in-use within sets of same-term occurrences are expressed in law-like or rule-like generalizations, having "initial conditions" and "deriva- tion conditions" to be satisfied by a pair of same-term occur- rences, we call the resulting rules analogy rules and say that meaning-differentiation-in-use for sets of same-term occurrences in English, considered synchronically, occurs on the whole in accord- ance with analogy rules.'3 (6) A same-term occurrence t2 in a dis- 11 Nothing more is signified by expressions of the form 'F discourse' than that the modifier 'F' is to be regarded as a rough and conventional indication of the likely subject-matter, or concerns or occasion for the discourse; thus the same exchanges may simultaneously belong to several "discourse environments," and, depending upon how elaborately one wants to classify discourse environments, there is no restriction upon the number of discourse environments to which a given expression may belong. 12 De Saussure first called attention to the difference between these two sorts of regularities and to the fact that in the synchronic regularities we find our best clues to the structure of a language. Cf. John Lyons, Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics (New York: Cambridge, 1969), pp. 45-50. It is because linguists have been so successful in the study of structure upon de Saussure's premise that I concentrate upon synchronic regularities in the investigation of meaning deriva- tion. To the doubt that meaning derivation can be analyzed this way because it is essentially a process, I reply that the conjugation of verbs, the alignment of the person and number of verbs and pronoun subjects also occur as processes in the use of the language, but, like meaning derivation, form patterns and regularities to be found within the available corpus. 18 In case one is led to expect too much, let me warn that I have not been able to put all the regularities I have observed, especially those concerned with semantic contagion, into this form as yet, or to display very many such regulari- ties. The investigation is too near its beginnings to have yielded many specifics;</page><page sequence="8">732 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY course context (2) that is meaning-derived with respect to an anal- ogy rule for E from a same-term occurrence tj that occurs in a discourse context (1) that is cognitively significant, is also cogni- tively significant. (Meaning derivation by analogy is cognitivity- preserving.) Some further explanation of the analogy hypothesis may help. a. Identifying same-term occurrences. It can be determined through distributional analysis by empirical linguists whether ele- ments of two utterances or inscriptions found in a speech or writing sample that is part of the available corpus, are tokens of the same term.14 No assumption has to be made as to whether the tokens have the same or different meanings. Thus the set of same-term occurrences of 'knows' within the corpus of available discourse in English will consist of all and only the inscription and utterance tokens of that (phonemic-orthographic) term type. I pass over ques- tions concerned with misspelling, shorthand, mispronunciation, accent, dialect, speech defect, mistyping, etc. because these can be moderately well settled by distributional analysis. b. Discourse context. We are considering only term occurrences within discourse contexts. A discourse context for a term is any complete sentential expression in speech or writing in which the term is used (as contrasted with "mentioned") and which is part of the available corpus of English. c. Available corpus. The notion of the available corpus is im- portant for this hypothesis. In constructing a dictionary, it is often useful for the compilers to use the corpus of a written language regardless of its distribution over time. But the kind of corpus relevant here is the kind a compiler would use to construct a dictionary of contemporary usage. It must, like the former, con- sist of verifiable quotations, but since we have to allow that there are relevant uses of terms which do not occur within the written corpus, we broaden the notion of "available corpus" to include recorded speech of all sorts, provided it represents contemporary speech: thus, radio tapes, video tapes with sound tracks, movies, newscasts, court transcriptions and recordings, phonograph records, but the ideas of "initial" and "derivation" conditions are broad enough to provide ample latitude for the formulation of the regularities. 14Cf. Zellig S. Harris, Structural Linguistics (Chicago: University Press, 1961) (originally titled Methods in Structural Linguistics), p. 361. Also, see Lyons, op. cit., ch. v. In accord with the current linguistic interest in morphemes as the smallest free variants which are meaningful and which are the units of gram- matical analysis, let 'term' be the same as 'morpheme' rather than 'word', which is too vague.</page><page sequence="9">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 733 etc., are all included within the corpus. Thus we are not concerned with what someone might say or would say, but directly with what someone has said or does say. At the same time we cannot, in a philosophical inquiry, document every usage of a term with a ref- erence to its actual occurrence within the available corpus; rather, the corpus is the empirical field of test; our usual examples are acceptable provided there is such an occurrence of the terms within the corpus of English; otherwise the examples are un- justified and misleading. Needless to say, the examples in papers such as this cannot be taken as extensions of the corpus of con- temporary English; otherwise they will become self-confirming. d. Multiplicity of meanings. When I talk of the multiplicity of meanings within sets of same-term occurrences, I have in mind such things as these: (a) In the analysis of the amount of damage caused when the train hit the automobile, the physical force was calculated ac- cording to three different formulas. (b) In the weeks of the revolution preceding Castro's taking power, the physical force was calculated to throw the economy and the bureaucracy into confusion. (c) After considering the facts carefully, the district attorney decided that the physical force was calculated, and proceeded to charge the suspect with aggravated assault with intent to kill. Whether or not we happen to have three distinct dictionary en- tries for the three senses of 'physical force' or of 'was calculated', a person who understands the contexts of discourse has no difficulty whatever grasping the differential meanings of these same-term occurrences. So too with 'has' in: (a) 'John has a comb with him'. (b) 'John has a home of his own'. (c) 'John has a wife already'. (d) 'John has a cold'. Here is a third example of meaning-differentiation-in-use: (a) Whatever a man knows, he does not know everything. (b) Smith is one of those who always knows he is right and seldom is. (c) The Internal Revenue Service knows that 10 per cent of the taxpayers falsify their income. (d) No, I do not know Smith, though I am acquainted with him. (e) (Someone else speaking) Why, yes, I do know him, you pointed him out to me yesterday, but I haven't met him yet.</page><page sequence="10">734 TUE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY e. Two senses of 'meaning-differentiation-in-use. In one sense, when we speak of meaning-differentiation-in-use, we mean only that, if we inspect in context a fairly wide sample of same-term oc- currences, we shall see that, compared with one another, they dif- fer in meaning, not entirely but in ways that represent the differ- ences in their contexts; although they are equivocal with respect to one another, they are not helter-skelter equivocal but equivocal by adaptation. That kind of meaning differentiation is illustrated by the three examples above and can be manufactured without presently discernible limit for almost any of the common terms of English. But when we have before us a large sampling of different meanings for sets of same-term occurrences, it is reasonable to ask whether there are formulable regularities within such sets of oc- currences. Is meaning differentiation without organizing prin- ciples, or does it occur in some regular way? For instance, can the difference in semantical categories for 'physical force' in various contexts be shown to be represented in changes in attached predi- cates like 'was calculated'? Or, perhaps, in differences in the lists of predicates that would be appropriate in the contexts? In the second sense of 'meaning-differentiation-in-use', when we say that terms are meaning-differentiated-in-use, we mean that there is regularity-conforming meaning differentiation (or analogy of meaning) among the same-term occurrences. To establish that there is meaning-differentiation-in-use (in this sense), we must establish that there are semantical regularities to which meaning-differen- tiated (sense 1) sets of same-term occurrences conform. f. Meaning derivation. Let it be understood that when I speak of meaning derivation, there is no assumption whatever that, from a speaker's or hearer's point of view, the "derived" sense is con- sciously or even actually dependent upon some, for him, prior sense. The notion is to be explained entirely in terms of the relationships the same-term occurrences have with respect to certain semantic regularities. Similarly, any true statement can be said to be de- rived from some other true statement with respect to the rules of logic, since there will always be a true statement which, manipu- lated according to the rules, will yield the true statement as a con- clusion, regardless of whether anyone ever derives that conclusion from that premise or not. Derivation is simply the relationship of the secondary to the primary with respect to some set of ordering principles. One of a pair of equivocal same-term occurrences is derived in meaning from the other with respect to an analogy rule</page><page sequence="11">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 735 R if and only if the one same-term occurrence satisfies the initial conditions of R and the other satisfies its derivation conditions.15 g. Contrast with simple equivocation. Meaning-derivative pairs of same-term occurrences are to be contrasted with simply equivocal pairs. For instance, 'plow' in 'New England farmers begin to plow in late April' and in 'The Quarterback will begin to plow through the line while the halfbacks feint an end run' is not simply equivo- cal, since the pair of same-term occurrences is related by semantical regularities, whereas 'piped' in 'The developers piped the sewerage into the stream' and in 'The coxswain piped the captain aboard' is simply equivocal. There is no general semantic regularity with re- spect to which the one may be considered derived in meaning from the other. The following three identificatory criteria for cases of anal- ogous meaning derivation are illustrative.16 h. Derivation Criteria. (1) Generability. tj is derived from t2 with respect to R if t1 is generable from t2 with respect to R. t1 is gen- erable from t2 with respect to R if a native speaker of E, who under- stands the use of tj in its context and who understands R (either explicitly or through experience manifested in the correct use of the language) can by following R generate a discourse context (3) in which t3 occurs univocally with t2 (and R is an analogy rule extrap- olated from synchronic regularities obtaining among same-term- occurrences in use). (2) Context Transformability. t1 is meaning-derived from t2 if a person competent in the language who understands the context for t2 and the relevant regularity can by altering the sentential expression and context of tj produce a context containing a same- term-occurrence t3 that is univocal with t2. 15 Here I simply by-pass questions about the various kinds of direct and indirect analogy ordering among sets of same-term occurrences as a whole (such as, 'expected' in 'I expected a guest', 'I expected rain', 'I expected a raise', 'I expected politeness'.) and related technical matters which are treated inchoately in "A New Theory of Analogy: I" forthcoming in the Proceedings of the Ameri- can Catholic Philosophical Association, 1970, to be reprinted in Logical Analysis and Contemporary Theism, edited by John Donnelly. There are a number of basic questions concerning the analogy hypothesis which are still to be answered. For instance, why may not the initial and deriva- tion conditions be reversed? What determines which are the initial and which the derivation conditions? What distinguishes the semantic regularities that are rele- vant to the analogy relationships from those which are not? That is why it seems better to talk about an analogy-of-meaning hypothesis rather than a theory at this point, or perhaps even an analogy conjecture or proposal. 16 Presumably, these are only first approximations of identificatory criteria which would have the requisite generality. They do seem to pick out derived uses in relation to the few analogy rules presently formulated.</page><page sequence="12">736 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY (3) Contracted Semantical Contrast. t1 can be said to be meaning- derived from t2 if there is in the context (1) some semantical unit q such that there is a counterpart unit + in (2) which is in semantical categorical contrast with p, and t1 may be considered to have its meaning as an alteration of the meaning of t2 (only so far as) to bring its semantical categories into accord with q. Thus, in the frame 'He caught the ', the pair of sentences 'He caught1 the cold' and 'He caught2 the thief' have the same term as verb, but the meanings of the verbs are different. The one is said to be meaning-derived from the other because the one may be regarded as an alteration of the meaning of the other to accord with the categorically contrasting direct objects. The kind of meaning derivation that corresponds to this third criterion is different from some of the sorts of meaning derivation picked out by the first two criteria. Examples of the regularities contemplated for (1) and (2) are: "a third-person singular, pres- ent-tense, active verb, used to attribute an action to an agent is also used to attribute an ability, a disposition, or a proclivity or ability, disposition, proclivity, etc." "An adjective used to indicate an apparent modification of some thing or state of affairs is also used to indicate the actual modification of such a thing or state of affairs." "An adjective used to describe the state of some object is used to describe the cause, effect, symptom, signs, etc., of the object-with morphemic adjustments in some cases." The quality and property senses of 'red' is an example. So, too 'evil deed', 'evil man', and so forth. But while in '- flies' we may have one case where we attribute a present ability to something, ('the SST flies'), and in another, a habit or disposition or proclivity, changes in the subjects to create categorial contrasts bring about a different kind of contrast in the senses of 'flies': 'The plane flies too low over the city'; 'The pilot flies too low over the city'. Here, although both are "dispositional" or "habitual" uses, the contrast in the two occurrences of 'flies' is a contracted contrast based upon the con- trast of semantic categories for the subjects. The sentence frame [NP 'flies', Adv.P.] is neutral to the sentence frame [NP 'determines the positions of the controls'.] neither entailing it nor excluding it. Hence the differential sense of 'flies' is determined by contagion of the semantical categories of the subject term, so that 'The pilot determines the positions of the controls' may be entailed by the second but not by the first expression. Semantic contagion seems to be of two main kinds: (a) contrast in meaning contracted from the contrasts in discourse environ-</page><page sequence="13">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 737 ment, and (b) contrasts in meaning contracted from semantic units which are elements in the sentential expressions. From the dis- course environment: 'It's a steal'. In an environment of baseball discourse, an umpire may settle a dispute over whether a player's move was legal or not (whether he moved before the completed pitch) with a decision in those words. Something quite differ- ent is meant when an automobile salesman describes his offer in such terms. The same is true of the expression 'That's my view' uttered in reply to certain questions about whether one believes something, and uttered upon first showing a visitor the vista outside one's home. From elements within sentential expressions: This sort of contracted semantical contrast is based upon the fact that in pairs of expressions with a common term, there may be other terms in categorial contrast whose contrast is contracted by the pair of same-term occurrences. There are a number of ways this happens; for instance: i. From contrasting subjects to contrast of predicates, 'Holding': 'John is holding the post out of plumb'; 'The crooked sill is holding the post out of plumb'; 'The Comptroller is holding the checks until Monday'; 'The accident is holding the traffic to ten miles an hour'. (The latter two cases involve more than one contrast of the types being enumerated here). Another example: 'His studies were in Arabic' and 'His letters were in Arabic'. Or: 'The foremen worked all day'; 'The truck worked all day'; 'The pump worked all day' (strained). ii. From contrasting predicates to a contrast of subjects: 'The Church cannot hold that many people'; 'The Church cannot per- mit doctrinal chaos'. 'My corn is just above ground' (plants); 'My corn is ready to eat' (ears). iii. From modifiers to subjects or predicates: 'He stared vacantly'; 'He stared angrily' (contrast induced in predicates by modifier- contrast). 'The Arabic language is difficult for the English'; 'The spoken language is deteriorating' (contrast of meaning induced in 'language' by contrasting modifiers 'Arabic' and 'vocal'). iv. From contrasting objects to a contrast of predicates: 'We told him to cancel the appointment'; 'We told him to cancel the check'. 'He negotiated the bonds'; 'He negotiated the curve'. 'He circled the place to sign'; 'He circled the place to land'. In general, there seem to be two different kinds of meaning-deri- vation situations, not entirely unlike the two kinds Aquinas had in mind when he distinguished analogy of proportion from analogy of proportionality: (1) differences in mode of ascription; and (2) con-</page><page sequence="14">738 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tracted categorial differences. Thus the ability, disposition, pro- clivity, cause, sign, expression of, and symptom of, uses of same terms seem to belong to the former kind. So do ascriptions involving the use of the same term from different points of view: 'He did it, unhappily', and 'He did it unhappily'. Similarly, the use of an expression like 'The place to land' to stand for some place and also to stand for some conventional sign of the place (e.g., a mark on a map) belongs to the first sort, meaning differentiation by con- trasting modes of ascription. And that does seem to be quite dif- ferent from derived differences in semantical categories for same- term occurrences. For instance, in the frame 'S read the entire re- port' substitute 'The announcer', 'The Committee', 'The proof- reader', 'The teacher', 'The second-grader', 'The information-storage device'; and in each case we get a contracted difference in the sense of the predicate. There is no set of "truth conditions" for the frame completed with a subject variable that can be satisfied by all substitutions of subjects for the variable. One of the defects of traditional philosophy of language, apart from quixotic theories of reference, has been the artificial division of expressions into two basic and supposedly independent units of meaning which in combination determine the sentential meaning; namely, subject and predicate. They are not independent in mean- ing. In 'His . . . was unsound', substitute 'ship' and then 'reason- ing', 'foundation', 'melon'; the senses of 'was unsound' differ ac- cordingly, and yet, as the medievals noticed, they are not unrelated. It was this which the "similarity of relations" hypothesis was in- troduced to explain. I think, eventually, by regarding analogy of meaning as a semantical phenomenon to be explained without recourse to theories about things, we can provide a better account of semantic contagion. The same effect is observed with contrasting category-determin- ing modifiers for two occurrences of a category-indeterminate term: 'His hand writing was unintelligible'; 'his published writing was unintelligible'. When we consider that we have no difficulty manu- facturing endless cases where same predicates are adjusted in mean- ing to categorially contrasted subjects, we are made to wonder why so much astonishment has been caused by the contrasts between 'God is wise' and 'Socrates is wise'. Given the evident contrast of semantical categories between the two subjects 'Socrates' and 'God', nothing should be more likely. In our natural language different completions of the sentence frame '. . . knows what I am going to do now' result in different</page><page sequence="15">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 739 conditions of applicability depending upon categorial contrasts in the subjects: 'My wife', 'My dog', 'My department', 'My bank'. It would certainly not be easy to state precisely the differences in con- ditions of applicability, the differences in entailments, in appropri- ate behavioral manifestations, attitudinal commitments (or any of those things Alston used to make his contrast between the determinateness of some employments of terms and the indetermi- nateness of the religious-discourse employments of those terms). III. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE ANALOGY HYPOTHESIS TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE COGNITIVE MEANINGFULNESS OF RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE? 1. The meanings of terms in religious discourse are to a large extent derived. There does not seem to be serious disagreement over that view, adopted by Alston and common to most persons who have discussed the matter.17 At least minimally, it is believed that one learns how to use such predicates in religious discourse only after having learned some other kind of use for those predicates. And though I have indicated that there might be some exceptions to that generalization, they are parasitic exceptions. 2. The analogy hypothesis is that meaning differentiation for same terms follows semantic regularities and that such derivation is cognitivity-preserving. Here the analogy hypothesis gains its purchase upon the discussion of religious discourse. First, it calls attention to the fact that meaning derivation for same terms is very common indeed, both within and across discourse environments. Secondly, it indicates that meaning derivation is analyzable through certain regularities among sets of same-term occurrences. Thirdly, it calls attention to the fact that changes in both the sense and the appli- cation of a term need not result either in a pair (or more) of occur- rences that are simply equivocal, or in a pair at least one of which is used nonliterally. (Thus it cuts the ground from under the usual arguments that religious language is essentially non- literal.) Fourthly, it helps us to notice that there is nothing about the meaning extension of terms in religious discourse that does not have exact and regularity-conforming parallels in kinds of dis- course whose meaningfulness is beyond sensible dispute. In particular, it helps us to notice that when same-term occur- rences occur as predicates with categorially distinct subjects, the 17 In fact, I do not know of any philosopher who has denied that the terms in religious discourse are either univocal with or derived from uses of those same terms in nonreligious contexts or who has denied that psychologically and epis- temologically, nonreligious uses of the basic terms precede religious uses for most persons.</page><page sequence="16">740 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY senses of the predicate-term occurrences are appropriately modi- fied; it is no anomaly, then, that the predicates applied to creatures contract categorial contracts when applied to God. The analogy hypothesis also causes us to notice that the same transitive predicate term, concatenated with categorially contrast- ing direct objects, undergoes a contracted adjustment of sense: 'John caught .. .', 'the ball', 'the cold', 'the idea', 'the implication', 'the fear'. So too, in the expression frame, 'S made x', 'made' under- goes one sort of adjustment in relation to categorially contrasted objects and another in relation to categorially contrasted sub- jects; both kinds of contagion may obtain simultaneously. 'S made a chair', S made a million dollars', 'S made the world', 'S made a mistake', 'S made a decision'. Now try 'Socrates', 'The University', and 'God' in each frame; sometimes the result is absurd, sometimes obviously false, and sometimes appropriate and carrying a modi- fication of the sense of 'made'. The categorial contrast of the subjects is exhibited by the pattern of contrast in absurdity, falsity, and appropriateness of the results of the substitution. What Aquinas talked of as adjustment of the modus significandi of predicates to the modus essendi of their subjects is here clearly seen to have a counterpart among the general features of dis- course. It should, therefore, occasion no wonder, but rather a little confidence, that this feature of natural discourse is preserved within religious discourse. Needless to say, it would be just as difficult to provide a precise specification of the conditions of applicability, sentential entailment, paraphrase, evidence, and so forth, for some of the expressions offered as examples above, as it would be to do so for the key expressions of religious discourse.18 18 The reason the dispute about the cognitive meaningfulness of religious dis- course has not been resolved satisfactorily is that the more general problem of providing an account of meaning-differentiation-in-use has not been resolved in the philosophy of language. Why should statements in religious discourse have to conform to a standard of cognitive meaningfulness that is not met by the simplest and most common sorts of utterances of ordinary discourse? 'John married Mary because he loved her'. What are the implications, conditions of application, and so forth of 'loved' or of 'because' in that expression? Alston said: "We know perfectly well how to handle furniture sentences in the contexts in which they are com- monly used. It is only their 'analysis' in some abstract philosophical sense that is puzzling. But sentences about God are likely to seem strange even in their native habitat. In the course of using them in religion we are apt to become baffled over what implications they have, what they exclude or do not exclude, and how they are appropriately supported or attacked" (op. cit. 430). The con- trast, despite its similarity to the passage from Nielsen at the end of note 2, above, is exaggerated; we should have the same difficulties about "craft-bound" talk if we were not insiders to the craft; and religious persons in the prac-</page><page sequence="17">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 741 Craft-bound discourse. One can convince oneself that unspecifi- ability of truth conditions, indefiniteness of what is implied, fuzzi- ness in evidential conditions, and vagueness of associated attitudinal commitments is neither peculiar to religious discourse nor asso- cated with deficiencies in cognitive content, by considering the conversation of persons skilled in some art or craft, for instance, type designing, cloth dyeing, weaving, farming, or cello playing. For example, two musicians may be quite able to describe some sound sequence as having one element that is "flat," when the devia- tion is not apparent to the untutored observer and the conditions they have in mind for so specifying some sound are unstated. Moreover, the musicians, even with the help of a philosopher, will be completely unable to tell you what the precise criteria are for the truth of a statement of that sort, especially when "being flat" is related to the direction (up or down-scale) in which the cellist is playing.19 The same holds for the way farmers use such words as 'mature', 'green', 'texture', 'ripe', and so forth. Access to the de- scriptive content of such expressions is pretty much limited to initi- ates in the way of life, the community of experience, in which the utterances have their home. Such craft-bound discourse, like all natural discourse, reflects the forms of human living, has its own specificity and nuances of descriptive (and evaluative) mean- ing, and, like every other discourse environment that is pretheoretical and whose expressions are used for things considered important, deeply felt, and actually experienced in the life of a community, exhibits no linguistic discontinuity with the rest of natural dis- course when examined in terms of the semantical regularity of the language. Religious discourse among believing Christians certainly satisfies these conditions. We can conclude from that, that the philosopher who wants to discount the cognitive content of re- ligious discourse because of the fact that he cannot easily discover tice of (as distinct from the reflection upon) religion are not often baffled at all. The reflective puzzlement with religious utterances is paralleled in what happens when we reflect upon statements about "the economic system," "the work of art," "the civil society," "the urban environment," "reading disabilities," "the future of graduate education." That is, when we try to provide theoretical analyses, we may become confused in just the way Alston describes; but that can happen in any area of discourse, as the difficulties in the linguistic analysis of ethics, aesthetics, social philosophy, and the philosophy of science make evident. 191 am not here prejudging the outcome of a philosophical analysis, but rather indicating that 'is off pitch' has different conditions in different con- texts and may be no less difficult to analyze than 'God made the heavens and the earth'.</page><page sequence="18">742 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY its conditions of application, truth, evidence, attitudinal commit- ments, or criteria for paraphrase, must either pretend to be able to do a great deal more, analytically, with the sorts of common dis- course I have illustrated with examples or have failed to notice that an easy yield to the analytic embrace is not to be found very often in human discourse. 3. But still it may be argued that, even on the assumption that the analogy hypothesis is correct and that the meaning deriva- tion of religious discourse conforms to general semantic regularities of natural language, the predicates in God-statements will all be categorially contrasted with every other occurrence of those predi- cates in nonreligious environments; that should certainly establish that religious discourse is in one way discontinuous with discourse of other sorts. But the assumptions of that argument need correc- tion. Not all the predicates in God-statements are equivocal with respect to all their nonreligious uses. 'God is not a body' employs 'body' univocally with its use in 'Socrates has a body', for it is just what Socrates has that God is to be denied. Generally, negative assertions about God contain predicates that are used univocally with certain nonreligious occurrences, though this is not universally true, as for instance, when someone says "God is not all-powerful" or "God is not the creator of the world." The claim that the predicates of God-statements are equivocal with all their non- religious occurrences holds true for all those simple affirmative cate- gorial propositions about God which would be considered correct by orthodox Christians. But equivocation of same-predicates in simple, affirmative, categorical statements results for any pair of subjects that are categorially in contrast; so the wrong conclusion has been drawn from that observation about religious discourse. The predicate 'is not finished yet' is vastly different if the category of its subject is a thing, 'the table' or 'the automobile', as distinct from an event, 'the play', 'the examination'. It is overemphasized that there is only one member of the God- category; there is only one member of the universe-category too, and the same sort of predicate adjustment is found in expressions with 'the universe' as subject. In general, categorially distinct sub- jects, in so far as they can have same-term predicates, have predi- cates that are analogous with one another. In fact the semantic dif- ference between predicates in G-statements and the occurrence of those same predicates in any other sort of statement is a simple con- sequence of the general semantic regularity that pairs of same-term occurrences as predicates in affirmative sentential expressions con-</page><page sequence="19">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 743 taining categorially distinct subjects, contract contrasts of meaning (and therefore, contrasts in conditions of applicability, truth condi- tions for the whole expression, entailment, paraphrase, etc.) which correspond to the semantical categorial differences in the subjects. We encounter exactly the same phenomenon when we examine the use of certain terms, e.g., 'larger', for numbers in contrast to the use of the same terms for physical objects. The same holds for all the categorial contrasts of subjects, predicates, objects, and some modifiers.20 4. But what of the sixth element of the analogy hypothesis: that analogy of meaning is cognitivity-preserving? The expanded claim is that, if a given term occurrence is cognitively significant in a cog- nitively significant sentential context, then a same-term occurrence that is meaning-derived from the first (with respect to an analogy rule) will itself be cognitively significant. That does not mean that the whole expression in which the term occurs will be cog- nitively significant, but only that the term does not loose any of its significance by being meaning-adjusted in some regular way, with respect to another occurrence of the same term. Rather, if the meaning adjustment is regular, then, unless cognitive evacua- tion occurs in some regular way, the term will have cognitive sig- nificance. And we should be able to determine what, if any, regu- larities hold for cognitive evacuation. There is no difficulty about preservation of significance in the "shift-in-mode-of-attribution" kinds of analogy. For if a shift in mode of attribution occurs in accord with a general regularity, nothing could have happened that would evacuate cognitive sig- nificance. (False and absurd expressions are cognitively significant.) But the matter is not so clear in the case of semantic contagion, because not every subject of some predicate P (or object 0) can be adjusted to every categorially contrasting predicate P' (or object 0'). Consider: (a) 'John eats wheaties', (b) 'John eats quadratic equa- 20 It is to be regretted that at this stage I can offer no analysis of "categorial contrast" which will not be circular because it employs talk about contrasts of appropriate subjects, predicates, objects, modifiers, etc. This problem will have to be attacked separately. For the time being, let us provisionally adopt the Fodor-Katz notion of "semantic markers" which would occur in an ideal dic- tionary. Two subjects, predicates, etc., will be in semantic contrast to the degree that their semantic markers differ. I realize that this resolves practically nothing, but at least it indicates that semantic category is not the same thing as the list of predicates, modifiers, and so on, which are appropriate, but logically precedes it. And that is indicated by the fact that when categorially contrasting subjects have the same predicate ('The man worried his wife', 'The dog worried the rope'), we have to understand the categorial difference of subjects (and objects) before we can say whether the predicates are univocal or not.</page><page sequence="20">744 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tions', (c) 'Saturday followed Friday', (d) 'Saturday followed Mary'. Possibly, we could regard (b) as a categorial adjustment of 'eats' to the contrasting object; yet it seems more likely that, in an appro- priate context for the expression, we have in (b) a figure of speech. But in (d) there cannot be a categorial adjustment of 'followed' to the object and simultaneously a categorial adjustment to the sub- ject, since the contrast, categorially, of subject and object would demand contradictory adjustments of the predicate. (The ways in which something can "follow" Mary are just the ways in which Saturday cannot "follow" anything except a day; the same is true of 'come after'.) This provides one rock-bottom criterion for whether an expression is nonliteral as a whole. It also tells us that, if there is no conflict in the sorts of categorial adjustments that must occur simultaneously, a literal use of the term is possible in that context and the term will not be robbed of its cognitive significance simply by its categorial adjustment. IV. CONCLUSION A. The State of Evidence for the Analogy Hypothesis. For parts of the analogy hypothesis the evidence available is conclusive; for instance, that multiplicity of meaning is common for sets of same- term occurrences; that the multiple meanings are not the result of simple equivocation, but in some way represent meaning adjust- ment to the semantical context and, sometimes, to the discourse environment; that the meaning adjustments exhibit some regularity and that the regularities are synchronic.21 But few of the regulari- ties one would expect have been formulated as yet, probably be- cause there has been no concerted investigation of the matter by philosophers and linguists. I have not independently argued as to why we should call these regularities, when formulated, "analogy rules," though the simi- larity of the material to what Aquinas called "analogy of meaning" is probably enough to justify the name, as does the ancient dispute between analogists and anomalists in the study of language in general.22 21 I have not in this paper tried to explain how analogous derivation of mean- inging occurs dynamically or over time (diachronically) but have treated the corpus as static, as synchronic, in order to point out that derivation of meaning is ubiquitous, rule-conforming, the same in religious discourse as in other sorts of discourse, associated with no limitation of cognitive significance and a matter of the greatest importance to the philosophy of language. 22 As Lyons, op. cit. p. 6-8, points out, from earliest times there was a dispute between anomalists and analogists over the pervasiveness (and the normative force) of regularity of structure in natural languages, particularly grammatical and morphological regularity. "It was a dispute as to what constitutes 'regu-</page><page sequence="21">ANALOGY AND RESOLUTION OF SOME COGNITIVITY PROBLEMS 745 That meaning-differentiation-in-use occurs, on the whole, in English in accord with analogy regularities is nowhere nearly established yet, though I think consideration of the enormous class of meaning derivations available to each of us who is aware of how we use the language should make this an extremely likely conjecture.23 That the use of a term in a context where the term is related by some analogy rule to a context that is cognitively sig- nificant, is also cognitively significant, needs considerably more scrutiny than it has so far received; though it is already clear that it is not conformity to the derivation regularities that evacuates significance, but something quite different. B. The Analogy Refutation of the Discontinuity Hypothesis. The main points in the analogy resolution of the dislocation challenge to the cognitive meaningfulness of religious discourse are (1) that there is a demonstrable continuity, conforming to general semanti- cal regularities for English, between the way terms function in religious discourse and the ways the same terms function in other kinds of discourse; (2) that derived meaning for same terms is the rule rather than the exception in natural language; (3) that the kinds of derivation that relate religious discourse to nonreligious discourse, particularly the adjustment of subject and predicate mean- ings to the contrasting categories of their complements, are found practically everywhere in extended discourse; (4) that those mean- ing derivations cannot represent linguistic discontinuity any more than a series of physical events known to occur according to the same general principles which govern nature as a whole can be said larity' in language." On page 31 Lyons remarks: "it came to be realized that 'analogy' was a major factor in the development of languages at all periods and could not be attributed merely to periods of decline and corruption." So too, I want to extend the analogist's claims to the area of semantics and to claim that meaning derivation for same-terms both diachronically and synchronically is regularity conforming. This is the initial reason for calling a theory of meaning derivation an "analogy" theory; other reasons will be encountered in the study of reasoning by analogy and the sorts of comparisons that are commonly called analogies. Moreover, as R. A. Hall, Jr. remarks, "The process by which semantic shifts take place is basically one of analogical extension or contraction of the practical situations in which a form is used" (p. 348, op. cit.). 23 I am presently attempting to gather a large enough sample of such deriva- tion regularities to complete the argument that meaning derivation does occur in accord with certain regularities. The first stone has hardly been turned in the understanding of analogy; the analogy hypothesis has predictive and heuris- tic value for the discussion of theoretical vs. observational terms, the explanation of the notions of models and metaphors, the accounting for reasoning by analogy and the justification of the cognitivity of religious, ethical, metaphysical and aesthetic discourse. Practically none of these matters has been approached in a suitably empirical, linguistically informed, and philosophically inventive way.</page><page sequence="22">746 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to be discontinuous physically with the rest of nature; and (5) that if there is some defect in religious discourse because of the cate- gorial adjustment of the meanings of its predicates, then this defect will pervade human discourse in general, and particularly the dis- course of the empirical scientist. Our showing that there is a semantic continuity between ex- pressions in religious discourse and other sorts of discourse does not entail that one can gain adequate access to the cognitive content of assertions within religious discourse by some sort of extrapola- tion from other sorts of discourse; the same experiential base is re- quired as would be required for us to grasp the sense of discourse about the tuning of instruments, proper intonation on the cello, the criticism of the state of crops, the perception of ducks on the horizon, the conditions of ice in Alaska, etc. We manifest our grasp of the significance of what is stated, not in some formal analysis, but in our ability to support, reject, criticize, question, object to, rephrase, translate, paraphrase, alter, amend, correct, and so forth, such utterances in ways that are intelligible within the discoursing community. An analysis is tested by its coherence with those mani- festations. The discontinuity hypothesis is based upon a mistake about what is involved in one's knowing the meaning of what is said; it is also based upon a mistaken contrast between the utterances of religious discourse and those of human discourse in general. Inspection of the analogy structure of English discloses no se- mantical discontinuity to be characteristic of religious discourse, and reveals that the semantic structure of religious discourse is so much like that of other sorts of discourse that doubts about the cognitive significance of religious discourse can be sustained only at the expense of extending them to most other sorts of discourse, a tactic which would weaken the attack by the degree to which it would have to include what is considered unchallengeable.
