<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRANSCENDENCE WITHOUT AND WITHIN: THE CONCEPT OF TTEN IN CONFUCIANISM Whether Confucianism is a religion or a code of ethics is a much debated question. That Confucius and his followers laid great importance on the rightful ordering of human life on earth, and that Confucianism as a whole exerted a great influence on the daily living of the Chinese in his relation to the family, society and the state cannot be denied. Because of this emphasis on ethics, Confucianism has been often labelled as Humanism. The essence of this Humanism, according to Lin Yu-tang, lies in the criterion that "the measure of man is man."1 It is true that Confucianism can be regarded as Humanism in so far as Confucianism stands for "a rationalized social order through the ethical approach, based on personal cultivation."2 Confucius' own attitude also appears to be, like that of Buddha, anti-metaphysical and anti-religious, for he concentrated on the essential human relationships and refused to talk about the world of spirits and immortality. For instance, in the Analects, Confucius' view on these matters was skeptical and negative : "The Master did not speak about strange phenomena, feats of strength, disorders or spirits."3 "When Tzu-lu asked the Master how to serve the spirits, he replied, 'You are not yet able to serve men; how can you spirits'?"4 "When Tzu-lu asked about death, he was told, 'You do not yet understand life; how can you understand death'?"5 However, the humanistic label is only the conspicuous and apparent aspect of Confucianism. There is another side which is 1 Lin Yu-tang, The Wisdom of Confucius, The Modern Library, N.Y., 1938, p. 6. 2 Ibid., p. 6. 3 The Analects, 7:21. 4 Ibid., 11:12. 5 Ibid., 11:12</page><page sequence="2">THE CONCEPT OF T'lEN IN CONFUCIANISM 1 47 often neglected in assessing the true picture of Confucianism. The other side of Confucianism is a reference of transcendence which goes beyond mere Humanism. In fact, Confucian "Humanism" is rooted in the transcendent ground which gives a sufficient reason for regarding Confucianism as a religion. Here, my understanding of religion is man's experience of self-transcendence through his relationship with his idea of the Transcendent. This experience entails a positing of the idea of the Transcendent on the basis of his awareness of limitations of human existence, and an ordering of one's life in accordance with the dictates of the Transcendent, including self-commitment and self-surrender to this idea of the Transcendent, in the hope that he may overcome his limitations so as to obtain self-transcendence. Confucianism would agree with Humanism that the goal of man is to fulfil the potential human nature, but unlike other humanisms, the potential human nature is not an ideal projected from the real situation of man, but it is firmly ground in the Transcendent. Therefore, the doctrine that the measure of man is man is only half true, for the essence of "man" is, in Confucianism, equated with the way of Heaven. What is being ignored in the attempt to label Confucianism as Humanism is, first, the ancient popular religion prevailing at Confucius' time which Confucianists incorporated into the total system of Confucianism, and secondly, the significance of Confucius' and other Confucian exponents' reference to the Transcendent. Confucius himself did not proclaim that he was a creator of a culture, but he described himself as "a transmitter" - a transmitter of Chou culture, which prevailed in the Chinese society prior to his time. The unique role Confucius played in the Chinese civilization was the rationalization of current customs, humanization of reli- gious beliefs and ceremonies, in such a way that he endeavored to bring out the essence or spirit of popular beliefs and practices, as Professor Fung points out in his History of Chinese Philosophy : "The great contribution of Confucius to Chinese civilization, indeed, has been the rationalization he has given to its originally existing social institutions."6 An example of the way he rationalized the existing 6 Fung Yu-lan, A History of Chinese Philosophy, vol. I, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1952, p. 63.</page><page sequence="3">148 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION institutions can be found in the following passage taken from the Analects:1 "Tsai Wo, asking about the three years' mourning, sug- gested that one year was long enough. 'If said he, 'a culti- vated man be three years without exercising his manners, his manners will certainly degenerate, and if for three years he make no use of music, his music will certainly go to ruin. (In a year), the last year's grain is finished and the new grain has been garnered ; the fire-making friction sticks have been changed .... a year would be enough.' 'Would you, then, feel at ease in eating good rice and wearing fine clothes?' asked the Master. Â£I should,' was the reply. 'If you would feel at ease, then do so; but a cultivated man, when mourning, does not relish good food when he eats it, does not enjoy music when he hears it, and does not feel at ease when in a comfortable dwelling. Therefore he avoids those things. But now if you feel at ease, then go and do them.' When Tsai Wo had gone out, the Master said: 'the un- feelingness of Tsai Yu. Only when a child is three years old does it leave its parents' arms, and the three years' mourning is the universal mourning everywhere. And Yu .... was not he the object of his parents' affection for three years'?" That Confucius was a transmitter not a creator has a particular significance in regard to the religious aspect of Confucianism. It means that Confucius simply accepted the current popular religious beliefs of the Chinese people, which had been handed down from antiquity. Therefore, it is safe to say that the religious aspect of Confucianism is entirely based upon the ancient Chinese folk faith. For this reason it is necessary for us to look into the ancient Chinese religious faith in order to understand Confucianism as religion. Like many religions of the world, the ancient Chinese religion began with nature worship and their basic religious attitude was animistic and spiritualistic. And then gradually, their thinking tended towards monistic deity without eliminating nature gods. The objects of worship in ancient Chinese religion are threefold: 7 The Analects, 17:21.</page><page sequence="4">THE CONCEPT OF T'lEN IN CONFUCIANISM 1 49 (1) T'ien (Heaven) or Shang Ti (God) - the worship of the Supreme Being. (2) Natural phenomena or natural objects - the worship of nature. (3) The spirits of man, the spirit of ancestors - ancestor worship and the spirit of heroes - worship of heroes. Among the natural objects, the Chinese regarded great moun- tains and great rivers as sacred and they offered sacrifices to these (such as T'ai Shan and Yangtze River). The Sun and the Moon and the stars, the seasons of the year, the wind and the rain, were also worshipped as deities. The earth and the crops were also deified, for the earth and the crops are responsible for the establish- ment of a nation. To say that they "lose the gods of the earth and the crops" meant the destruction of a nation. Hero worship was centered around each person who achieved a great agricultural feat. When these heroes die, they believed that their souls persisted in existing, controlling the fortunes and mis- fortunes of the present world. Upon death, the spirits are believed to return to the Heaven from which they originally came. On the basis of this belief ancestor worship was developed. In the period of Ch'un Ch'iu (722-481 B.C.) when the yin-yang school was de- veloped, man is believed to have been composed of two compo- nents, jyirc and yang. Tang is the force of the heaven, while yin is the force of the earth and man exists by the combination of these two forces: namely, the spirit represents the yang force, while the body represents the yin force. When a man dies, the spirit returns to the heaven and the body returns to the earth. This was the popular faith of the Chinese people, although Confucius himself was hesitant to make a positive statement about death. The most important object of worship which will be elaborated here is the concept of Heaven, T'ien or Shang Ti in the ancient Chinese religion, which Confucius and his disciples took for granted. In spite of the strong humanistic emphasis in Confucia- nism, the idea of T'ien amply reveals the transcendental dimension of Confucianism. As far back as two milleniums B.C., during the Hsia and Shang dynasties, the Chinese developed the concept of Heaven (THen) or the Lord (Ti), a sort of monotheistic belief without the weakening polytheistic tendency associated with nature worship. The pattern of development of religious ideas in China is remarkably similar to that of other religions of the world. The develop- ment is from polytheism to transcendent monotheism and then to</page><page sequence="5">150 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION immanent monism. The concept of T'ien or 77 signifies the mono- theistic transcendent source of man and things, which sustains all existing things and controls human destiny. But at this stage of transcendent monotheism, we see two definite forms of belief manifested in the ancient Chinese religion. First, the Chinese recognized the anthropomorphic deity in the name of 77, who sent blessings or calamities, gave protection in battles, sanctioned under- takings, and passed on the appointment or dismissal of officials. In the period of Chou, this anthropomorphic deity is replaced by the concept of T'ien as the supreme spiritual reality. However, we must not be confused in thinking that T'ien and 77 are two separate deities. Perhaps it can be said that T'ien is a more general, universal term whereas Shang Ti is T'ien personalized as the Lord. Both T'ien and 77 are transcendent in that they are regarded as the source of all existence and also as controlling all events in the world. In Confucius' time, the impersonal T'ien is believed to be the Way of Nature, which includes human nature. It was the common belief of the Chinese that human virtue is the way of Heaven, and that man, through his moral deeds, could control his own destiny. Here, we see the transition from transcendent monotheism to immanent monism, which is often characterized as the humanistic emphasis of Confucianism. Let us now discern different ways in which the term T'ien is used in Chinese writings in an attempt to understand the significance of the concept of T'ien. Five different ways in which the term T'ien is used may be observed : (1) Physically, T'ien stands for sky, that is, T'ien is often spoken of in opposition to earth, as in the common phrase which refers to the physical universe as "Heaven and Earth" (T'ien Ti). (2) A ruling or presiding T'ien, that is one such as is meant in the phrase "Imperial Heaven Supreme Emperor" (Huang T'ien Shang Ti) in which anthropomorphic T'ien or 77 are signified. (3) A fatalistic T'ien, equivalent to the concept of Fate (ming), a fate of man over which he has no control. This is the T'ien Mencius refers to when he says: "As to the accomplishment of a great deed, that is with T'ien." (Mencius, Ib, 14). (4) A naturalistic T'ien, which is equivalent to Nature. (5) An ethical T'ien, that is, one having a moral principle and which is the highest primordial principle of the universe. In</page><page sequence="6">THE CONCEPT OF T'lEN IN CONFUCIANISM 151 Chung Tung, it is written: "What T'ien confers [on man] is called his nature."8 In these usages of the term Tien, apart from its literal meaning, that is, sky, the meanings of THen can be largely divided into two: (a) T'ien as the personal deity as given in 2; and (b) T'ien as the impersonal reality, which is the way of nature and the way of man, an idea of immanence somewhat like Providence in the Christian religion, as given in 3, 4, and 5. However, this immanence of T'ien is not an immanence which excludes the sense of transcendence, because the immanent manifestations in nature and man have their transcendent source which is T'ien. Probably, the concept of T'ien was originally developed as designating the place above the world where rulers, i.e., kings, generals and ministers went after death. In this sense, T'ien here has a spatial meaning; it is a place, abode, region above and beyond this world. Then, the spatial concept of T'ien is replaced by the personal concept of Ti. During the Shang dynasties (1751-1112 B.C.) the Chinese kings and the subjects made elaborate sacrifices to their ancestors and to other spirits. Among these spirits the most powerful spirit was called Ti. The Chinese believed that the spirits and especially their ancestors supervised their destinies. That T'ien is identified with Ti is given in the book of History (Shu Ching) where the rule of Hsia (2205 ?- 1 766 B.C.) was usurped by the Shang founders. It reads: "The sovereign of Hsia has many crimes and Heaven (T'ien) has commanded me to destroy him .... Fearing the Supreme God (Shang Ti), I dare not but punish him .... and carry out the punishment appointed by Heaven (T'ien)."9 The ideogram of T'ien, has one horizontal line above the letter Ta and resembles a man whose two arms are stretched out and his two legs are wide open. Ta signifies man and the ideo- gram of T'ien has one line above man. So, T'ien originally meant the sky which covers human world, but it came to mean Ti or Shang Ti, who, residing in heaven above, controls the world below. Therefore, T'ien or Ti here means God in heaven. One theory of THen from the standpoint of its ideogram holds that the early form of this character stood for a "large and important man." On the basis of this theory, H. G. Creel advances the 8 Fung Yu-lan, A History of Chinese Philosophy, vol. I, p. 31. 9 Ibid., p. 30.</page><page sequence="7">152 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION familiar theory of origin of religion that God is simply a great man deified. He writes, "It came to refer to the most important men of all, the former kings who had died and taken up their abode in the heavens. As a sort of 'council of the gods' they controlled human destinies. Then, because Chinese does not distinguish singular and plural, T'ien came to be thought of as singular, an overruling Providence located in the sky. The same word also came to be used for the material heavens. Thus there was derived the concept of Heaven as a rather impersonal intelligence. When the Chou conquered the Shang, they equated their Heaven with 77, the Shang deity, as the Romans identified some of their gods with those of the Greeks."10 What is interesting in the Chinese thought is to regard the king or emperor as the "Son of Heaven." The king or emperor is looked upon as a mediator between Heaven and man, an agent sent down to the world by T'ien. The "Son of Heaven" is the sovereign of the state who is believed to be an agent who came to the earth in order to rule and lead the people upon the command of Shang Ti. The "Son of Heaven" has two tasks to perform: first, to make his people offer sacrifices to Ti who is their own ancestor, and secondly, to lead them lest they may violate the will of Heaven. Thus the first task was carried out by developing elaborate rituals of sacrifice, and the second task was pursued through the art of divination by using tortoise shells or stalks. One of the great renovations made in the period of Chou, whose culture Confucius attempted to revive and refine, in contrast with the customs of Shang period, is to turn their attention from without to within; instead of relying on external ceremonies and instruments, the Chou people began to look into their own nature to apprehend the Will of T'ien. This tendency of Chou dynasties was crystallized in the teachings and system of Confucius. Thus we come to see the immanent concept of T'ien as the way of Heaven in nature and man, and it is for this reason that Confucianism is often regarded as Humanism. The concept of T'ien thus has undergone the change of its meaning: from the spatial abode to personal Lord, and then, to the immanent way of the universe. Therefore, when Confucius speaks of the way of Heaven, the decree of Heaven, the Mandate 10 H. G. Creel, Confucius and the Chinese Way, New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1949, p. 114.</page><page sequence="8">THE CONCEPT OF T'lEN IN CONFUCIANISM 1 53 of Heaven, he is referring to Tien as meaning the immanent way. Tien has now become synonymous with Nature. With the rise of Taoism, which advocated the philosophy of Tao, the Way, Tien became materialized and naturalized. What is called Tien (Heaven) in the five classics is later equated with Tai Chi (First Principle) of / Ching, and also with Li (Reason and Principle) of neo-Confucia- nism. What are the philosophical and religious implications of Tien? (1) Tien is the source and the First Cause of all existing things and the ancestor of mankind. Although we do not find any theory of creation or cosmological discussion in the Confucian Classics, it is evident that Tien is believed to be the ultimate source of all existent things. To be sure, Tien is not like the Christian God who created the heavens and the earth, as a transcendent agent. In his Geschichte der alien Chinesischen Philosophies Alfred Forke pointed out that Tien was responsible for the existence of all things in much the same way as the Pantheistic God was. Certainly, there is a resemblance between the ancient Chinese thought and Pantheism. Tien can be likened to Spinoza's God who is the self-caused Sub- stance whose mode of operation is strictly out of its own necessity, so that Tien cannot be separated from Nature. Thus Forke insists that Tien is not a transcendent being who, while residing outside the realm of the world, creates the world out of nothing, but that Tien is simply the totality of the world and the source of finite things. Yet, Tien controls the world and manifests a moral world order. It comes to aid the good, and restrains and punishes the bad. Forke concludes that Tien, although not a person, operates like a person.11 This pantheistic tendency in the concept of Tien defi- nitely suggests its immanence, but it would be a mistake to conclude that Tien is only a concept of immanence and not that of trans- cendence, as Forke seems to indicate. For, Tien is transcendent in so far as it produces thing and mankind, and it is immanent in so far as it is ubiquitous as the cosmic principle which is manifested as heaven and earth. It is the common belief of the ancient Chinese that all things including mankind came from Tien. Mencius quotes a passage from the Book of History, which reads: "Heaven, having produced 11 Quoted in Ogihara Hiroshi, Toyo Rinli Gaku Shi (History of Oriental Ethics), vol. II, Tokyo, Ken Bun Kan, 1934, p. 96.</page><page sequence="9">154 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION the inferior people, appointed for them rulers and teachers, with the purpose that they should be assisting God, and therefore distin- guished them throughout the four quarters of the empire. Whoever are offenders, and whoever are innocent, here am I to deal with them."12 Another passage from Mencius supports this idea of T'ien as the ancestor of mankind : "Heaven's plan in the production of mankind is this: - that they who are first informed should instruct those who are later in being informed, and they who first apprehend principles should instruct those who are slower to do so. . ."13 T'ien as the ancestor of mankind supervises the existence of all men regardless of their being good or bad. Good or bad are to co-exist in the world and it is believed to be the way of T'ien in producing mankind. We have already mentioned the fact that T'ien is synonymous with Ti. It is interesting to understand the original meaning of the primitive form of the Chinese character for Ti. The primitive form of the character Ti is shown as the form of an inverse triangle, v which signifies fruits yielded after the falling of flowers in plants. The fruit contains seeds that will produce the plants again. Con- sequently, the original meaning of the character Ti is the source of the production of plants, and this came to mean the ancestor of mankind. So Ti is the God in heaven who produced mankind and therefore, men are its offsprings. (2) T'ien is the source and sustainer of the cosmic order. The cosmic order consists of two kinds of law : one, the law of nature and the other, the law of human society. The feeling of awe and reverence that wells up in us for the natural law and the moral law is directed to the greatness of T'ien, as Kant says that he was awe- stricken by "the starry heaven above and the moral law within." In the Book of History, it is recorded that Heaven gave the legendary king, Kun, the Great Norm with its nine categories. These nine categories refer to the natural as well as human societal order which prevails in the universe. Among these, categories which refer to the natural order are the following: 12 The Works of Mencius, I B, 3. 13 Ibid., V A, 3.</page><page sequence="10">THE CONCEPT OF T IEN IN CONFUCIANISM 1 55 "The first category is the Five Agents (five elements) ; namely, water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. . . . The fourth category is the Five Arrangements of Time; namely, the year, the month, the day, the stars, planets, zodiacal signs." In regard to natural human capacities, "the second category is the Five Activities; namely, appearance, speech, seeing, hearing and thinking."14 The cosmic order also includes an order for human society and human conduct. The Shu Ching (The Book of History), in its section on "the Counsels of Kao Yao", describes human institutions and moral duties as prescribed by T'ien. It reads as follows: "Let him not have his various officers cumberers of their places. Men must act for the work of Heaven! From Heaven come the relationships with their several duties; we are charged with those five duties, and lo! we have the five courses of honorable conduct! From Heaven come the several ceremonies ; from us come the observances of these five ceremonies, and lo! they appear in regular practice! Heaven confers its decree on the virtuous, and there are five habiliments and five decorations! Heaven punishes the guilty, and there are the five punishments to be severally used for that purpose."15 In this passage, the leading idea is that Heaven, setting up the rules of Five Duties, Five Ceremonies, Five Habiliments, and Five Punishments, rewards and punishes men according to good or bad conduct, and the emperor, the son of Heaven, abiding in the decree of Heaven, respects these rules. Among these rules the most significant rule is that of Five Duties which became the basis for the Confucian ethics. The Five Duties are dependent upon the five orders of human relationship upon which Confucianism develops its virtues: they are, as Mencius makes clear: "Between father and son, there should be affection; between sovereign and minister, righteousness; between husband and wife, attention to their separate functions; between old and young, a proper order; and between friends, fidelity."16 14 Chan Wing-tsit, ASource Book in Chinese Philosophy, Princeton University Press, 1 963, p. 9. 15 Quoted in Fung Yu-lan's A History of Chinese Philosophy, vol. I, p. 33. 16 The Works of Mencius, III A, 4.</page><page sequence="11">I56 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION (3) T'ien ming, Heaven's Decree, Heaven's Mandate. T'ien ming, which is translated as the Decree of Heaven, the Mandate of Heaven, or the Appointment of Heaven, is the concept which designates the relationship of Heaven with human affairs. Through this concept, Confucius and the Confucianists tried to understand human destiny and moral obligations. The Chinese held this concept as the cause of human affairs and the ground of moral obligations, similar to the Greek concept of Moira and Christian concept of Providence. T'ien ming can be understood as meaning "Fate" as it does to many people. As professor Chan Wing-tsit points out, many ignorant people believe that their lives are directed by spiritual forces beyond their understanding or control, so that ming is identified with fate. However, the educated, Professor Chan goes on to say, understand that ming does not mean fate in the sense of mysterious control by spiritual beings but means Heaven's Mandate, or Heaven's Decree, that is "what Heaven has given to a person, what Heaven has endowed him with."17 "The educated" here obviously refers to the Confucianists who would regard ming as human destiny which is appointed by Heaven, therefore to be fulfilled and followed. In the Analects, Confucius speaks of Heavenly Fate or Will (T'ien ming) in this sense as clearly shown in the following passages : "When Po Niu was ill the Master went to inquire about him. Having grasped his hand through the window he said : 'We are losing him. Alas! It is Fate. That such a man should have such a disease! That such a man should have such a disease!"18 "The Master said: 'If my principles are going to prevail, it is through Fate. If my principles are going to fail, it is through Fate. What can Kung-po Liao do against Fate?'"19 "Confucius said: 'The Superior Man holds three things in awe. He holds the Will of Heaven in awe; he holds the great man in awe; and he holds the precepts of the Sages in awe'."20 17 Charles A. Moore, The Chinese Mind, Honolulu, East-West Center Press, 1967, p. 301. 18 The Analects, 6:8. 19 Ibid., 14:38. 20 Ibid., 16:8.</page><page sequence="12">THE CONCEPT OF T'lEN IN CONFUCIANISM 1 57 Tien ming can be interpreted in a personalistic way as the will, design or purpose of the Supreme Being. Then, Tien is the pur- poseful Supreme Being or Ruling Heaven who appoints a unique destiny to a person, Confucius felt that he had a holy mission which had been conferred on him by Heaven, that is, the transmitter and preserver of Chou culture, when he said, "Since Heaven has not yet destroyed this culture, what can the men of K'uang do to me?"21 This belief is also shared by his contemporaries, among them an officer in charge of a small frontier town, who once said, "The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue."22 Tien ming as the will of Heaven is also responsible for the rise and the fall of dynasties, the fortunes and misfortunes of the emperor, and the appointment and dismissal of the "Son of Heaven." The immanent and naturalistic interpretation of Tien ming occurs when Tien ming is understood as the Way of Heaven. The Way of Heaven came to be equated with the Way of man. It is the Confucian belief that the Way of Heaven in man is his moral nature, which is innate and intrinsic, endowed in him by the Decree of Heaven. The Decree of Heaven viewed from the stand- point of human life is the human nature, which is basically moral. Thus, man's morality is to be finally traced back to the Decree of Heaven. Confucius said, "Heaven produced the virtue that is in me."23 Mencius also writes, "He who knows his nature knows Heaven. To preserve one's mind and to nourish one's nature is the way to serve Heaven."24 The philosophy of Human Nature de- veloped in Confucianism is an offshoot of the doctrine of Tien. Chung- Yung, or the Doctrine of the Mean, one of the Confucian Four Books, shows the unity of Heaven and man, for its main thesis is that human nature, endowed by Heaven, is revealed through the states of equilibrium and harmony, which are themselves the con- dition of the world and the universal path. Chung- Tung says, "What Heaven imparts (ming) to man is called human nature."25 Since 21 Ibid., 9:5. 22 The Analects, 3 : 24. 23 Ibid., 7:22. 24 The Works of Mencius, VII A, 1. 25 Chung- Tung I.</page><page sequence="13">158 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION this nature is to be realized, self-realization becomes the goal of the Confucian man. The way to realize one's nature is, according to Chung- Yung, through one's own effort at moral cultivation which is called cKeng or sincerity of will. Chung- Tung teaches that "Only those who are absolutely sincere, can fully develop their nature. If they can fully develop their nature, they can then fully develop the nature of others. If they can fully develop the nature of others, they can then fully develop the nature of things. If they can fully develop the nature of things, they can then assist in the transforming and nourish- ing process of Heaven and Earth. If they can assist in the transforming and nourishing process of Heaven and Earth, they can thus form a trinity with Heaven and Earth."26 Sincerity which epitomizes the whole of the Confucian ethical teachings makes things real and true. It not only realized one's own moral nature, but also realized the nature of things. Sincerity, as Professor Chan notes, is "not just a state of mind, but an active force that is always transforming things and completing things, and drawing man and Heaven together in the same current."27 In Confucianism, the moral nature of man is centered around the concept ofjen or human-heartedness, for the man ofjen is the one who has fulfilled his moral potentials and one who will form one body with Heaven and Earth. Jen is the affectionate feeling between man and man, and it is rooted in the affectionate feeling between father and son, filial piety, and fraternal feeling between brothers. These affectionate feelings are regarded as the most basic and most natural feelings of man, and the Confucian ethics is built upon these natural feelings, natural manifestations of human nature. In the words of Confucius, "Filial piety and fraternal submission! Are they not the root of all benevolent actions (jen)?"28 Chung- Tung is more explicit in the function ofjen when it says, "the great exercise of it is in loving relatives."29 The same idea is also expressed in the Book of Mencius : "The richest fruit of benevolence (jen) is this - the service of one's parents. The richest fruit of righteousness 26 Ibid., 22. 27 Chan Wing-tsit, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, p. 96. 28 The Analects, 1:2. 29 Chung- Tung, 20, 5.</page><page sequence="14">THE CONCEPT OF t'iEN IN CONFUCIANISM 1 59 is this - the obeying one's elder brothers."30 These statements clearly express the idea that human virtue is the most natural manifestation of human nature and that it is the Decree of Heaven for man. Therefore, to obey the Decree of Heaven is to bring out morality in human society. The way ofjen, the cardinal virtue of Confucianism, is achieved when the affectionate feelings towards parents and brothers are transferred to society. Thus the most natural feeling of affection such as we see in filial piety and brotherly love was stressed as an important bridge between the Way of Heaven and the Way of man. Despite the impression which Confucius gives us as being ag- nostic and skeptical towards religious matters, for which reason he is commonly regarded as the champion of Humanism, Confucius himself was highly spiritualistic with a keen interest in the trans- cendental life. Furthermore, he looked upon the transcendental life as the highest form of human life, as we learn from his famous statement which describes the stages of his spiritual development. He states: "At fifteen I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I took my stand : at forty I had no doubts ; at fifty I was conscious of the decrees of Heaven; at sixty I was already obedient to these decrees; at seventy I just followed my heart's desire, without overstepping the boundaries."31 In this passage, Confucius speaks of six stages of life which com- prise the intellectual, moral, and religious spheres of life, and the religious sphere is considered as the highest. The first three stages deal with man's intellectual and moral life, and the last three stages are concerned with the spiritual and religious sphere of life. One significant implication of this passage is that one's life is not completely fulfilled if we remain only in the intellectual and moral spheres, and that one must recognize another realm of life which transcends the intellectual and moral spheres of life. It is the realm of life which has something to do with Heaven, the transcendent dimension of human life. Among the contemporary China scholars, Professor Fung yu-lan seems to be most emphatic about this religious, mystical and transcendent aspect of Confucius' thought. 30 The Works of Mencius, IV A, 27. 31 The Analects, II, 4.</page><page sequence="15">l6o INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION Professor Fung interprets the last three stages as "Knowing Heaven," "Serving Heaven," and "Rejoicing Heaven."32 "Rejoicing Heaven," the last stage in the spiritual development of Confucius, can be understood as equivalent to the state of a mystic when he has achieved a mystical union with God in the Western religions, or the state of mind after Enlightenment in Zen, in such a way that his action becomes an "instrument of God," completely spontaneous, devoid of the will of the ego. To sum up, we have stated that the concept of THen in Con- fucianism has had various meanings such as Abode, Personal Lord, and Immanent Way of the Universe. In this variety of meanings, it is to be noted that the dimension of transcendence has always remained with the concept. Therefore, T'ien can be said to be something like what Jaspers calls "the Encompassing" which transcends the horizons of the world and man, yet T'ien, like "the Encompassing" of Jaspers, is the source of everything finite, al- though it does not appear in itself. After the doctrine of Tin and Tang had become popular in the Chinese thought in the 4th century B.C., T'ien was conceived of as the Ultimate Principle of the universe which produces and reconciles the yin and yang forces in the universe. This ultimate principle is called T'ai chi, or Great Ultimate as we discover it first in the Book of Changes, and then incorporated in the neo-Confucian cosmology. Thus, the idea of T'ien turns into the cosmic superior or conciliatory principle which reconciles the inferior principle of positive yang and that of negative yin, as Hubert Benoit observes in his book, The Supreme Doctrine, when he says, "Creation results, from the interplay of three forces: a positive force, a negative force, and a conciliatory force."33 Benoit symbolizes this by a triangle; the two lower angles of the triangle represent the two inferior principles of creation, positive and negative; the apex represents the superior or conciliatory principle. If we apply this model to the idea of T'ien, we would have two inferior principles of yin and yang at the bottom, and T'ien, the superior or conciliatory principle on the top.
