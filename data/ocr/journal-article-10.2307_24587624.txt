<plain_text><page sequence="1">New and revised life history of the Florida hairstreak Eumaeus atala (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) with notes on its current conservation status Sandy Koi1* and Jar et Daniels Abstract Southeast Florida is considered part of the Caribbean archipelago and a biodiversity hotspot for conservation priorities, with many endangered spe cies precinctive to the Lower Peninsula. The tropical butterfly Eumaeus atala (Poey) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) is currently found In Southeast Florida, the Caribbean, Cayman Islands, and Cuba, but was once considered probably extinct in Southeast Florida, where it has made a significant population increase during the past 30 yr. The State of Florida lists f. atala as imperiled, based on the species' ephemeral and cyclic abundance, isolated extant populations, reduced and highly fragmented habitat, and vulnerability to stochastic weather events. The objective of this captive-rearing intensive study was to fill gaps related to E. atala's overall biology and ecology in order to assist recovery efforts. Life history was studied under controlled environmental conditions to document the life span, reproduction, and development. Longevity proved to be much greater than previously recorded, reproductive behavior supports increased genetic cross-over, and conservation efforts point toward the need for continued monitoring of fragmented populations. Results may help in the design or improvement of management practices for E. atala and other imperiled pine rockland species. Key Words: butterfly; tropical Insect conservation; pine rockland Resumen Se considera el sureste de la Florida como parte del archipiélago del Caribe y un hotspot (punto clave, gran riqueza de especies) de blodiversldad para las prioridades de conservación, con muchas especies endémicas en peligro de extinción en la parte baja de la península de la Florida. Actualmente, se encuentra la mariposa tropical Eumeo atala (Poey) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenldae) en el sureste de la Florida, el Caribe, las Islas Caimán y Cuba, pero fue una vez considerado probablemente extinta en el sudeste de Florida, donde su población ha Incrementado signlficamente durante los pasados 30 años. El estado de Florida enumera E. atala como una especie en peligro, sobre la base de la abundancia efímera y cíclica de la especie, las pobla ciones existentes aisladas, su habitat reducido y muy fragmentado, y la vulnerabilidad a los events meteorológicos estocásticos. El objetivo de este estudio intensivo de criarlas en cautividad fue para llenar los vacíos de datos relacionados con la biología y la ecología general de E. atala con el fin de ayudar a los esfuerzos de recuperación. Su historia de vida fue estudiado bajo condiciones ambientales controladas para documentar la duración de vida, la reproducción y el desarrollo. La longevidad resultó ser mucho mayor de lo que fue registrado anteriormente, el comportamiento repro ductivo soporta mayores esfuerzos de cruce y de conservación genética apuntan hacia la necesidad de un seguimiento continuo de las poblaciones fragmentadas. Los resultados pueden ayudar en el diseño o mejoramiento de las prácticas de manejo para E. atala y otras especies de las áreas aisladoas de pinos en terreno rocosos en peligro.

Fresh leaf material was cut bi-weekly, and the stems of the individual leaves were stored in deionized water. Fronds were then placed Into a floral aquapic (Aquapic, Syndicate Sales, Ko komo, Indiana, USA) to ensure that fresh leaf material was presented to the larvae for consumption. Larvae were maintained in open plastic containers measuring approximately 25 x 50 x 10 cm until they entered into the wander ing stage, wherein the larvae begin searching for a pupation site, at approximately 10 d of age. At that point, the larvae and boxes were maintained in 61 x 61 x 30.5 cm fabric cages (Castle Cage Size JUMBO, LiveMonarch Foundation, Boca Raton, Florida, USA). Larvae are gre garious feeders (Minno et al. 2005) and were maintained with their brood-mates throughout the life cycle until adult eclosión. Cages were cleaned and fresh Zamia leaves were presented to the larvae every morning. Food was replenished throughout the day if nec essary. Plant material was presented to the larvae as appropriate for the larval stage; i.e., fresh new growth was given to neonates and older leaves to older larvae. Larvae were allowed to complete development and pupate within the screen fabric cages. Pupae were misted periodically with deionized water to help prevent desiccation. Following eclosión, all adult butter flies were transferred to a fabric flight cage of approximately 182 cm2 floor area (Greenhouse Castle Cage, Live Monarch Foundation, Boca Raton, Florida, USA) to facilitate courtship and oviposition. Cut Zamia fronds were suspended from the ceiling in aquapics for oviposition. Four lamps with 160 Watt bulbs were located at one end of the cage pro grammed to emit extra lighting on a 1:2 h on-to-off cycle during the day. Adults were provided with deionized water, to avoid possible chemicals in tap water, and with Gatorade® (The Gatorade Company, Chicago, Illinois, USA) in fruit punch, orange, or watermelon-citrus fla vors. The fluids were offered ad libitum from inverted centrifuge tube feeders, modified from the design described by Hughes et al. (1993). Water was also continually provided via a length of dental packing cord (TIDI Products, Neena, Wisconsin, USA) inserted into a 20 mLflask par tially sealed with laboratory parafilm and filled with deionized water. Feeders were hung from the ceiling in the same manner as the oviposi tion leaves, as well as installed on a short "table" for easier accessibility from the floor where older adults of both sexes often congregated dur ing the night. In addition, occasional seasonal native flowers (primarily Bidens alba [L.] de Candolle; Asterales: Aseraceae) were provided. All feeders were replenished daily and cleaned weekly. Cotton balls soaked with deionized water were placed on the ceiling of the fabric cage, and the entire cage was misted twice daily with deionized water from a regular spray bottle. The flight cage was cleaned monthly for disease prevention. Newly eclosed adults were identified with unique alphanumeric codes using a silver metallic Sharpie® brand permanent paint marker (Newell Rubbermaid Office Products, Oak Brook, Illinois, USA) on both ventral hindwings to allow immediate recognition of individuals. Bio logical data recorded included sex, dates of ovipositing, larval eclosure, pupal emergence, and day of death. Observed matings, number of ovi positions, and associated behaviors were documented, as were fecun dity and fertility. Samples of wing cord length were measured from the basal sclerite and resilin patch of the left forewing attachment to the thorax in a straight line to the apex of the wing (Fig. 1). Male dorsal forewing colors were recorded. Females did not display strong varia tions in dorsal wing color, although there was a marked difference in the extent of color present. All individual adults observed in both cap tive and wild colonies displayed unique variations in the described and species-recognized patterns on the ventral wing surface (Fig. 2). Because adult females were not isolated from one another, egg clutches were not identified per individual females. The adult Atala m Fig. 1. Wing cord length on adult Atala butterflies was measured from the ventral basal sclerlte on the left forewlng to the apex of the same forewlng us ing a clear metric ruler. shows highly aggregated behavior in wild colonies, and females have been observed simultaneously ovipositing on the same leaflet as oth ers (per. obs.). With only 1 or 2 coontie leaves in the flight cage, the females gathered and oviposited together on the leaves without any observed stress or aggression. This is normal behavior in a site with limited host plant availability (S. K., unpublished data). However, be cause individuals were marked, it was known in many cases which fe male laid eggs and which male mated with her. Marking also allowed documentation of the time passed between mating and ovipositing and of mating behaviors. IMMATURE MEASUREMENTS Eggs were collected from the adult flight cage daily in the afternoon and counted. Eggs were measured with a standard digital mlcrocaliper under a Leica S8APO stereo microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buf falo Grove, Illinois, USA) while still on the leaf to prevent accidental damage to the egg while measurements were taken. Larval exuviae were collected and photographed. Measurements of larvae were abandoned soon after recording was started as it was apparent that the size of the larvae did not necessarily correspond to its age and therefore the measurements could not determine age. Weight of larvae was abandoned for the same reasons; however, some measurements and weights were taken for specific parameters and re sults are discussed below. Pupal development was categorized from pre-pupal stage to pharate adult. Development time and size were recorded for each life stage, and individuals were followed from egg and first hatch as a larva until time of death. Pupal weights were recorded for variously aged pupae. ADULT MEASUREMENTS Adult wing cord length measurement was taken on the left fore wing, from the bottom of the basal sclerite and proximal point of resilin where the forewing emerges from the thorax, to the tip of the apex of the forewing in a straight-line measurement to the nearest whole mil limeter using a transparent ruler (C-Thru® Ruler Company, Bloomfield, Connecticut, USA).

Females were capable of Initiating oviposltion by the 3rd day after emergence, when chorions were fully formed around the oocytes, and laid as few as 1 egg up to a cluster of as many as 50 or more eggs, generally using the side of a fiddlehead or the underside of a newly emerged Zamia leaf. However, we observed in the field that females also would lay eggs on older leaves, adaxial leaf surfaces, stems, and even reproductive cones of the host plant when host plant availability was limited. Occasionally, females in the captive population laid eggs on non-host substrates such as cage walls, and we had observed newly eclosed females using non-host plants in wild colonies twice (the na tive host plant was located directly underneath in both cases). Eggs laid on non-host substrates were often fertile, and hatched larvae survived to adulthood within normal development parameters whether reared alone or with other larvae, or reared on the native host or experimen tally on non-native Zamia vazquezii D. W. Stev., Sabato, A. Moretti &amp; De Luca (Cycadales: Zamiaceae). Ovipositing occurred on the same day as mating, or within a day afterwards, and occurred before or without mating. The average age of lst-time female oviposition in the captive colony was 19.36 ± 7.85 d (n = 234) (Table 1). Eggs were chosen haphazardly for measurement from fronds sus pended in the adult flight cage, from 5 different broods over a 2 mo period to assure a robust sample size (n = 600). Eggs ranged in size from 0.75 to 1.25 mm (mean 1.00 ± 0.15 mm) and showed a bimodal distribution, with the modes at 0.99 and 1.11 mm (Fig. 3). We observed a marked visual difference in the size of eggs from individual dissected females, indicating that size variability is an inherent part of their biol ogy (Fig- 4). Egg development time varied greatly, ranging from 4 to 13 d in the captive population, with an average development time per egg of 6.6 d ± 1.1 d (n = 10,582). There was a 36% successful hatch rate from eggs in the captive population (n = 3,809 larvae) (Table 2). Eggs had a 3-leaved micropyle and highly sculptured chorion sur face, typical of Lycaenidae (Fig. 4). We noted that the underside of the egg was smooth and flat and adhered to the leaf surface with proteins exuded by the females' accessory glands. The undersurface was clear, allowing yolk or the embryo to be seen when the egg was removed from the substrate and inverted upside down. Larvae chew through the micropyle area and did not eat the shell, even avoiding it entirely when neonates congregated to scrape the surface of the leaves en masse with their mandibles during the 1st instar; older larvae also avoided eggs by eating around them. LARVAL AND PRE-PUPAL DEVELOPMENT Larval development time was highly variable, ranging from 14 to 28 d in the laboratory (n = 1,021). The average development time was 18.4 ± 3.6 d after emergence from the egg (Table 2). Neonate larvae were capable of releasing silk lifelines to aid in locomotion, such as descend ing from a higher leaflet to another, or to adhere to a leaf. Larval broods were reared with siblings; individuals were reared alone when they had hatched from only 1 ovum in a clutch. Five newly hatched larvae that were weighed within 2 h of hatching and reared on Z. integrifolia had an average weight of 7.2 ± 0.9 mg, ranging between Table 1.

Continued support of educa tional programs, re-introduction endeavors, and monitoring of wild and semi-wild colonies are other important steps in maintaining the viability of a species (Rawson 1961; Covell &amp; Rawson 1973; Kremen 1992a,b; Emmel &amp; Minno 1993; New 1993; Deyrup &amp; Franz 1994; Cor nell &amp; Hawkins 1995; Hanski 1999; Hardy &amp; Dennis 1999; Schultz et al. 2008; Algar et al. 2009; IBWG 2011). There is increasing awareness of the need to protect cycads world wide (Hubbuch 1991; Oberprieler 1995, 2004; Chemnick et al. 2002; Schneider et al. 2002; Pérez-Farerra et al. 2006; Nagalingum et al. 2011; Calonje et al. 2013), and the economic value of ornamental non-native cycads in urban environments can be exponential. Control of herbivo ry, by culling eggs or removing larvae to another plant or location, in an integrated pest management manner (Hubbuch 1991; Culbert 1994) is vital to sustaining urban populations to protect both the cycad and the butterfly. Eggs can fairly easily be removed from the slick waxy surface of most Zamia plants with a fingernail or metal spatula, which is help ful for those who wish to remove the eggs to reduce the population to control eruptions or who wish to protect their cycads from herbivory damage. Detached eggs should be frozen overnight to humanely dis patch of unwanted future generations, although eggs that land in the substrate will be found quickly by predatory ants or anoles. Neonate larvae that hatch in the substrate are so small that they will be unlikely to survive long enough to find the host plant again before predators find them (especially because they do not harbor toxins until they have ingested plant material). The information presented here on E. atala ecology is designed to assist biologists, conservationists, and homeowners in managing and recovering this rare endemic species. Conserving all elements in eco systems is ultimately mandatory for human existence, and recognizing the value of all of the earth's biota is one of the most important steps in bringing the balance back to humanity.
