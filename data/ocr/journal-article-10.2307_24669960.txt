Scott TyndaleTyndale Seminary, 25 Ballyconnor Court, Toronto ONM2M 4B3, Canada iscott@tyndale. ca Abstract In sharp contrast to other highly Hellenized Jewish works, the Book of Aristeas depicts the Pentateuch as a purely human composition. Moses was endowed by God with a prodigious intellect so that he could compose a law superior to any other, but Israel's legislator received no direct revelation or guidance. Likewise, the DOC translation is depicted as a purely human achievement. If the law is "inspired" for the author of Aristeas, it is only in the sense that skilled rational insight amounts to perception of the divine mind. Keywords Letter Letter ofAristeas, law, scripture, inspiration, Pentateuch, Philo Introduction: Inspired Scripture? We often say that early Jews believed their authoritative books to be "inspired" or "revealed." Amid the fray of recent debates over the exis tence of a Jewish "canon" in the Second Temple period, it is usually taken for granted that the growing scriptural collections were at least credited with "inspiration."2 Yet early Jewish writers rarely offer explicit discussions " Thanks are due to Annette Yoshiko-Reed, David M.

The few direct discus sions of scriptural inspiration often focus on the Pentateuch and envision Moses as a prophet.3 Josephus extends this prophetic model to all the scriptures of Israel,4 and it would be easy to assume that he represents a consensus among Jews of the prior three centuries. In the Book of Aristeas, however, we find a very different view of scriptural inspiration, one which stands out as distinctive among his Alexandrian contemporaries.5 The author of Aristeas does want to acknowledge the Pentateuch as a site of divine revelation. Yet instead of invoking some mode of supernatural communication, the writer exalts the educated human intellect as the medium of divine speech. In Aristeas it is precisely in and through the human capacities of Moses and others that God's truth is communicated faithfully to Israel and the world. I. The Law's Ambiguous Labels With all the praise of the law in Aristeas, the books of Moses are never called "inspired" (θεοπνεύστος). In fact, the characters in this narrative account use highly ambiguous language for the Israelite collection. The (92), all in The Canon Debate (ed. Lee M. McDonald and James A.

The recent consensus places the composition ofAristeas sometime in the second c. B.C.E., with a preference (on grounds of language and the Ptolemaic procedures depicted) for the latter third of that century.

Scott / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 3 words used to describe the law do associate it with God, but only in a general way. The legislation is "divine" (θειος) (31).6 This could mean that its contents originate with God.7 More often, though, something is called θείος in Hellenistic literature if it belongs to a god,8 is pleasing to the gods,9 is somehow like a god,10 or is devoted to a deity's service." At times the adjective is used in such a vague way that the intended connection between the object and the gods is difficult to define.12 Such language was also used in Hellenistic literature for anything noble and excellent, on the general assumption that wisdom, skill and virtue find their ultimate source with the gods.13 Hence the Roman Histories of Polybius, roughly contemporary with Aristeas, describe the general Scipio as "more divine" (θειοτέρος) because his accomplishments were "more amazing" (θαύμα στοτέρος) than those of other men. Polybius emphasizes, though, that these deeds were performed without any divine aid (Hist. 10.2.6). Even more significant is Polybius' discussion of the laws framed by Lycurgus for the Spartan state. The greatness of Lycurgus' legislation forces Polybius to regard it as "more divine" (θειοτέραν), and not merely "human" 6) English translations of Aristeas are my own. 7) The adjective denotes the direct involvement of the gods/God in, e.g., Polybius, Hist., 10.2.12; 10.5.7; 29.21.9; frag. 44; and the broken passage 22.16.1; 2 Macc 3:29; 4 Macc 4:13, 21; 8:22; 9:9, 32; 18:22; Ezekiel the Tragedian, Exag. 220; Aristobulus, Frag. 2 (Eusebius, Praep. ev. 8.10.9, 12, 16, 17), Frag. 4 (Eusebius, Praep. ev. 13.12.3); cf. the "divine inheritance" in 4 Macc 18:3; Philo, Opif. 1.23. The neuter singular substantive τό θείον is often used for a deity, but this expression is absent from Aristeas (see, e.g., Polyb., Hist. 4.17.11; 4.20.1; cf. Certamen Homeri etHesiodi 214, 309; 4 Macc 13:19; 17:22; Ezekiel the Tragedian, Exag. 99; Aristobulus, Frag. 2 [Eusebius, Praep. ev. 8.10.1]; Frag. 4 [Eusebius, Praep. ev. 13.12.4]). 81 In 4 Maccabees God's throne is θείος in that it belongs to the deity (4 Macc 17:18). The Sibyl foretells in Sib. Or. 5.249 the rise of a Jewish race (γένος) which is "divine" (θείον) and "heavenly" (οΰράνιον) in that its people live around the "city of God" (πόλις θεοϋ) (5.250). Cf. 2 Macc 9:11; Philo, Opif. 1.31. 9) Polybius seems to define what is θειοτάτος as that which is προσφιλέστατος τοις θεοΐς (Hist.(Hist. 10.2.7). ,0, Philo (Leg. 1.18) calls the "light of virtue" θείον δντως, indicating not only its founda tion in the character of God, but also the ontological relation of human (rational) virtue and the divine mind (cf. Leg. 2.10). Cf. Philo, Cher. 1.93. The Alexandrian translation of Ben Sira's wisdom speaks of a διήγησις θείας which consists of pious human conversation (Sir 6:35). In 4 Macc 17:11 the battle of wills between Eleazar and the gentile ruler is called an άγών θείος (17:16; cf. 7:7). 12' E.g., Philo, Leg. 3.152. 131 See "θείος," LSJ, 788 [I.3.b]; Polybius, Hist., 12.26b.5; 36.16.7; Homer, Od. 2.341; 9.205; II. 7.137; 9.214; Herodotus, Hist. 2.66.</page><page sequence="4">4 I. W. Scott / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 (κατ' άνθρωπον) {Hist. 6.48.2). Yet Polybius is elsewhere quite explicit that the Spartan code was conceived and framed without any divine inspiration {Hist. 10.2.6-12). What makes this passage particularly fruit ful for our understanding of Aristeas is that Polybius singles out for praise the Spartan laws capacity to produce free, virtuous citizens, people who promote the welfare of the community (πολιτεία) (Hist. 6.48.1-8; cf. 6.47· 1-4).14 This is precisely the function of the Jewish law in Aristeas and the basis for its greatness.15 It is quite possible, then, that the writer of Aristeas Aristeas is likewise thinking of such moral and political excellence when he calls the Jewish law θείος. Are we missing, in this comparison with writers like Polybius, a distinct Jewish use of θείος in reference to Moses' legislation? Not likely. The adjective is barely used at all in the LXX and it does not figure prominently in more traditional Jewish literature.16 Those writers who usually refer to things as "divine" are the same ones who are most heavily indebted to Hellenistic literary conventions and thought forms.17 Not surprisingly, these enculturated Jews employ the term in the same range of ways as their gentile counterparts.18 In 4 Maccabees, for example, the 141 In Polybius, Hist. 6.48.1-8 the law of Lycurgus is said to inculcate σωφροσύνης and ανδρεία and to make the Spartans σώφρων, άλκίμος, γενναίος. It gives the people "free dom" (έλευθερία) and leads them to be less prone to rebellion (άστασίαστος). 15, When characters in Aristeas sum up the purpose of the Pentateuch, it is always said to encourage common Hellenistic virtues such as "piety" (ευσέβεια) (2), "beauty" (το καλόν) (7), "culture" (παιδεία) (8), and "justice" (δικαιοσύνη) (131). Eleazar himself suggests, from a Jewish point of view, that it leads one toward "the good life" (τό... καλώς ζην) (127). He then goes on to re-interpret the distinctive laws concerning diet and clothing as promoting "pure (self-)examination" (άγνην έπίσκεψιν) (144), "justice" (δικαιοσύνη) (168), and moral "discernment" (διαστέλλειν) (150), while discouraging the "oppression" (καιαδυναστεύειν) of the weak (148) and "doing wrong" (κακοποιητικός) in general (163). The same virtues named by Polybius are praised and embodied by the Jewish trans lators, living testaments to the law's impact (see, e.g., Aristeas 237, 248, 281). The Jewish community is also depicted as a πολιτεύμα, whose members are πολίτας (see 44, 126), and the Jewish law has equipped the translators to advise the king wisely on kingship and public administration in the long symposium scene (172-300). 16) The term θείος occurs only 6 times in the earlier books of the LXX (Exod 31:3; 35:31; Prov 2:17; Job 18:15; 27:3; 33:4), mostly in the set phrase πνεύμα θείον (cf. Aristobulus, Frag.Frag. 2, 10.4; Philo, Leg. 1.33). The adjective appears a handful of times in Ben Sira (6:35), 2 Maccabees (3:29; 4:17; 9:11), and 3 Maccabees (7:11). 171 In 4 Maccabees, a reasonably short book which borrows heavily from Hellenistic moral philosophy, θείος appears 24 times. ls) See the examples from Jewish writings included in notes 7-14 above.</page><page sequence="5">I. W. Scott /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 5 martyr Eleazar praises "divine reason" (θείος λογισμός), the faculty by which human beings can control the passions (4 Macc 13:16; cf. 7:9).19 These more Hellenized writers do, at times, call the Torah "divine," and some of these authors doubtless do intend to capitalize on the word's ambiguity, hinting that the legislation has God as its author.20 Often, though, it remains highly ambiguous in what sense the law is "divine," and θείος could easily mean no more in these cases than it does for Polybius. The writer of 4 Maccabees, for example, calls the martyrs' strug gle against the Egyptian king a "divine contest" (17:11), and then soon after refers to the Jews as "athletes of the divine legislation (της θείας νομοθεσίας)" (17:16). If the struggle and the legislation at its heart are "divine" in similar senses, then the writer likely means to say simply that the Mosaic code embodies a lifestyle of devotion to God, a lifestyle that follows the dictates of divine reason.21 In light of this usage, when we read in Aristeas that the law is θείος we should not assume this is pointing to God as the law's author. Certainly, when Demetrius says that the books of the Jewish law contain "divine matters" (τά θεια) (315; cf. 3), this com mon expression denotes the subject matter or quality of its teaching, not its origin in revelation.22 "י This use of θείος to characterize reason should also be connected with the Stoic and Middle-Platonic philosophical notion that each human mind participates in the divine mind (see, e.g., Philo, Opif. 1.20, 25-31). 20י E.g., 2 Macc 4:17. 211 See also 4 Macc 7:7, where a life lived in keeping with the law is said to be a "divine life" (θείος βίος). This suggests that the "divinity" associated with the law can at times be primarily a matter of virtue. Hence Eleazar's own words, encouraging obedience to the law, are "words of divine philosophy" (της θείας φιλοσοφίας... λόγους) (4 Macc 7:9), i.e. they inculcate a life in keeping with reason. Cf. 3 Macc 7:11; 4 Macc 5:16, 18; 6:21; 9:15; 11:27. In Mos. 2.12 Philo calls Moses' laws "truly divine" (άληθώς θείοι), but sets this along side the claim that they are the "most noble" (κάλλιστοι) of all. In unpacking these state ments, Philo simply says that "they have not left out anything that should be included" (μηδέν ών χρή παραλιπόντες) {Mos. 2.12) and that they are "immortal" (αθάνατα), enduring unchanged through the generations (Mos. 2.14). So, though Philo clearly does see God's direct involvement in their composition (Mos. 2.11), this may not be the pri mary sense in which they are "divine" in 2.12. Hence he can also call them θεοπρεπές in Mos.Mos. 2.15, a term which cannot denote Gods involvement in their composition but rather characterizes the laws themselves as "godlike," "suited for a god," or "marvellous" (Mos. 2.15). By contrast, when Philo refers to θείαις προστάξεσιν in Mos. 2.60, the adjective does seem to point to God as the one who commands (cf. Leg. 3.8). 221 LSJ, 788 (II.3.b). See 4 Macc 1:16-17; Aristobulus, Frag. 5 (Eusebius, Praep. ev.</page><page sequence="6">6 I.W. Scott /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 Other epithets for the law in Aristeas remain equally ambiguous about the books' relationship with Israel's God. When the law is called "holy" (άγιος) (45), the writer is merely highlighting the fact that it has been devoted to the deity, or that it is valued or protected by God.23 The Penta teuch is also called "revered" or "sacred" (σεμνός) (5, 31, 313; cf. 144), but this term is at most a synonym for άγιος. Often the adjective simply points to a vague "noble" or "majestic" quality in a human being or a product of human crafts.24 Hence the related adverb (σεμνώς) is used in Aristeas to describe the "magnificent" quality of Ptolemy's gifts for the 13.12.12); Philo, Leg. 3.47, 71; Sophocles, O.T. 910; O.C. 1537; Xenophon, Cyr. 8.8.2. The θείοι ϋμνοι of 4 Macc 10:21 are clearly hymns about God. Closely related to this is the gloss "inquiries concerning the divine" which Liddell, Scon, and Jones suggest in Plato, Soph. 232c; Aristotle, Metaph. 1026a.l8; cf. Gen. an. 731b.24; Phys. 196a.33; Eth. nic.nic. 1141 b. 1 (LSJ, 788 [II.3.c]). Note, though, that in Sib. Or. 3.812 the αινίγματα θεία are prophetic message originating with God. 231 Liddell, Scott, and Jones ("άγιος," LSJ, 9) give the basic gloss "devoted to the gods." Hence in his account of the Jerusalem cult in operation, Aristeas tells us that an observer will be awestruck by "each holy arrangement" (εκαστον άγίαν κατασκευήν) (99). Notice, too, how the name of God is said to be written on the high priests mitre with "holy let ters" (γράμμασιν άγίοις) (98). In both cases άγιος indicates the cultic fimction of an object or ritual. w See "σεμνός," LSJ, 1591. Σεμνός is not uncommon as an epithet for a deity (LSJ, 1591 [1.1]; e.g., Diodorus Siculus 13.102.2). More often, though, it refers to things associated with or dedicated to the gods (1.2) including sacrifices (Pindar, Olymp. 7.42), a sacred cave (Pindar, Pyth. 9.30), a cultic hymn (Aeschylus, Pers. 393), a life lived in temple service (Euripides, Ion 56), etc. Hence the Sabbath is the σεμνότατη ήμερα in 2 Macc 6:11 (cf. Prov 8:6). In 4 Macc 5:36 Eleazar describes his mouth as σεμνός because it has not eaten unclean food (cf. 4 Macc 7:15; Prov 15:26). The term can also be used of human beings to indicate their honour, dignity, or beauty (Polybius, Hist. 6.33.9; 8.11.4; 16.33.4; 21.23.10; 4 Macc 17:5; Diodorus Siculus 1.93.1; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiq. rom. 6.59.1; 7.56.1; Aristophanes, Eccles. 617; Isocrates, Or. 3.42; Plato, Phaedr. 257d; etc.) or of objects which are exceptional, beautiful, or expensive (Aristophanes, Plut. 940; Xeno phon, Hell. 3.3.1; Demosthenes, Or. 3.26; Aristotle, Poet. I458a.21; Eth. nic. 1146a. 15) (LSJ, 1591 [II]). Even actions or experiences can be "fine" or "noble" (Polybius, Hist. 6.50.3; 15.22.1). In Diodorus Siculus 13.21.4 the adjective seems equivalent to ένδοξος. Hence, in Aristeas 258 Ptolemy is advised to embark on "great and majestic" (μεγάλα και σεμνά) construction projects (cf. σεμνύνω in 152). Here again there is no strong pattern of LXX usage. Σεμνός and its cognates occur in the LXX only three times outside the books of Maccabees, all three in Proverbs (6:8; 8:6; 15:26). In fact, the use as a divine epi thet seems to reflect the attribution of human modes of honour to the deity. Hence, in 2 Macc 8:15, God's name is both σεμνός and μεγαλοπρεπής, "magnificent" in much the same sense as great men. So we cannot infer any particular theological ideas when a Jewish writer occasionally describes the law as σεμνός (e.g., 2 Macc 6:28).</page><page sequence="7">I. W. Scott / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 7 temple (81).25 This suggests that when the author refers to the "noble" (σεμνώς) way in which "everything was set out" (πάντα άνατέτακται) in the law (144), early Jewish readers would not have heard a claim that God revealed the regulations. Even if we were to take σεμνώς in the strong sense "in devotion to God," the point would be merely that Moses' human authorial activity (ένομοθέτει ταΰτα Μωϋσης) was an expression of his piety (144).26 Indeed, Aristeas later seems to say that the law's "sacredness" or "nobility" (την σεμνότητα) is to be found in the way its "thought" (διάνοιαν) is "aligned with nature" (φυσικην) (171).27 There is no indication that God was involved in the composition.28 Finally, when the law is called "pure" (αγνός), the term simply highlights the truth and moral goodness of its teaching (31).29 Through this law the Jewish nation has been "established as pure (αγνοί καθεστώτες) in body and soul" (139), i.e., the people has been guided into a way of life marked by monotheism and justice.30 None of these epithets for the law would rule out a claim of super natural revelation. At the same time, none of them actually make the claim that the books or their teachings were revealed by God. The 25י At times the adverb σεμνώς can mean simply that an action is undertaken "seriously" (Polybius, Hist. 5.88.4). 26) This is not unlike the statement in 4 Macc 1:17 that by being educated in the law one learns "divine matters" (τά θεία) in a "reverent" (σεμνώς) way. See also the translators affirmation that God has endowed Ptolemy with "noble thinking" (την σεμνην έπίνοιαν) which leads him to practice justice towards his subjects (271). 27) Hadas (Aris teas, 167) translates φυσικην διάνοιαν as "inherent character." In this con text, though, talk about what is "natural" (φυσικός) more likely recalls the Hellenistic ideal of a life lived in keeping with nature (φύσις). Likewise, διάνοια here likely means the "thought" or "idea" encoded within the law. Similarly, in 292 the king's "mind" (διάνοιαν)(διάνοιαν) is described as "pure" (άγνην) and "untouched by any evil" (άμιγη παντός κακοΰ). 28) Cf. σεμνώς to describe Ptolemy's manner of thought in designing the temple furnish ings (56). Note too how, in 5, the law is called σεμνός in the context of Aristeas' recogni tion of Philocrates' "inclination toward what is sacred" (πρόσκλισιν προς την σεμνότητα). Here σεμνότης is a very general term for piety or proper devotion, and the law seems to be σεμνός simply in that it guides its followers in a life of devotion. 291 Although Liddell, Scott, and Jones ("άγνός," LSJ, 12) do provide the gloss "holy" as one option for αγνός, and it can be used to describe cultic spaces, the focus is clearly on cultic purity vs. desecration or cultic impurity. Hence the noun άγνεία is used for the rit ual and dietary observances which distinguish Jews from others {Aristeas 142; cf. 106). 301 Cf. Aristeas 144, where the law works to promote "pure self-examination" (άγνην έπίσκεψιν).</page><page sequence="8">8 I. W. Scott / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 language applied to the Pentateuch produces a vague nimbus of reverence around the writings, but leaves the basis for this respect and awe ambiguous. II. Demetrius on God's Protection of the Law One passage often held up as evidence of divine revelation in Aristeas is the account given by Demetrius, near the end of the work, of past abor tive efforts to publish parts of the Jewish law (312-317).31 The philoso pher explains that some who tried to translate and publish it were "struck down by God" (ύπό του θεοΰ πληγέντες) (313). Theopompus, he reports, was driven insane for thirty days just when he was going to include material from the Pentateuch in his history (314-315). Likewise, Theo dectes suddenly developed cataracts when he was about to include material from the law in one of his tragedies (316). All of this has been viewed as evidence that Demetrius (and so the author of Aristeas as well) understands the law to be divinely revealed. If we examine the passage carefully, however, we find no clear statement that the laws contents were given or authored directly by God. The closest we come is Demetrius' declaration that the law "has come into being through God" (δια θεοΰ γεγονέναι) (313). Yet this is a strange turn of phrase. Granted, διά can occasionally be used as a near-equivalent of ύπό to intro duce the agent of a passive verb.32 Still, when Jewish writers choose a preposition to signal God's agency they settle overwhelmingly on ύπό, not διά.33 Nor should this surprise us, since the instrumental and intermedi 311 311 So, e.g., Harry Orlinsky, "Septuagint as Holy Writ and the Philosophy of the Transla tors," HUCA 46 (1975): 89-114 (96). 32) See "διά," LSJ, 389 (A.III.a). In Aristeas we find such uses in 32, 37, 45, 128, 183, and probably 87. 331 In the LXX of the Tanak the phrase διά [τοΰ] θεοΰ appears in eight passages (Gen 4:1; 40:8; Exod 22:8; 1 Sam 22:10, 13, 15; 1 Chron 14:10; Jer 3:23), and the related phrase διά [τοΰ] κυρίου occurs 10 times (Josh 11:20; Judg 1:1; 1 Sam 23:2, 4; 28:6; 30:8; 2 Sam 5:19, 23; Isa 29:15; 51:20). Yet only five of these instances actually deal with Gods agency in an event (Gen 4:1; 40:8; Exod 22:8; Josh 11:20; Isa 51:20; on the rest, see below n. 39). When we add the five instances of the phrase υπό [τοΰ] θεοΰ (Deut 21:23; Prov 15:29; 31:1; Isa 61:9; 65:23) to the 15 instances of υπό κυρίου (Gen 26:29; Exod 16:3; Lev Lev 10:6; Deut 33:12, 29; Josh 24:27; 2 Chr 19:2; Ps 106[107]:2; Prov 3:11; 22:14; Isa 45:17; 51:11; 62:12; 66:16; Jer 32:33), we see a clear preference for ύπό in expressing divine agency.</page><page sequence="9">I. W. Scott / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 9 ary overtones of διά would have seemed inappropriate to most Jews for describing God's action.34 In keeping with this pattern, the characters of AristeasAristeas prefer ΰπό over διά in every other reference to God's agency.35 In fact, Demetrius himself switches back to ύπό in the very next sentence of 313 to say that "some who wanted [to publicize the law] were struck down by God (ΰπό του θεοΰ) for their attempt and gave it up." So not only does Demetrius' use of διά in 313 break with normal Jewish patterns of speech, it also represents a sudden and momentary break with the This This preference is even more marked in other Jewish literature. The διά phrase does not appear at all in the deuterocanonical books of the LXX, while ύπό often introduces θέος (1 Esdr 1:25; 8:3; 9:39; 2 Macc 1:11; 7:14, 16; Sir 45:1, Ep Jer 1:61, cf. Pss. Sol. 6:2; 17:26, 32) or !ούριος (1 Esdr 8:77; Sir 3:16; 30:19; 46:13; cf. Pss. S0L 3:4; 6:2; 8:34; 11:2; 16:15). In the Jewish Greek Pseudepigrapha we find only a tiny handfiil of instances of the διά phrase (e.g., Eupolemus, Mos. 2.9, 11; Lives of the Prophets 4.8), none of which denote simple agency (see below, notes 37 and 39). Josephus speaks of God's agency almost exclusively with ύπό rather than διά (e.g., Ant. 1.55; 1.213; 1.256; 1.326; 2.152; 2.218; 2.283; 8.314; 9.2; 9.182). Philo does occasionally use διά in a highly technical sense for Gods agency (see below, n. 39), but he too employs ύπό in the overwhelming majority of cases where God's agency is concerned (e.g., Opif. 1.153; Leg. 1.40, 41, 80, 95; 2.55; Conf. 1.136; Fug. 1.68; Decal. 1.101). Hence, when Danker proposes a use of διά for God as the simple agent of an accompanying verb he cannot adduce any Jewish examples outside the NT except for the passage in Aristeas under consideration here, 313 (BDAG,(BDAG, 225 [A.4.b.p]). In the New Testament, as well, the ύπό phrase is the norm when expressing God's agency, appearing in Matt 22:31; Acts 10:41, 42; 26:6; Rom 13:1; 15:15; 1 Cor 2:12; 2 Cor 1:4; Gal 3:17; 4:9; 1 Thess 1:4; 2:4; Heb 5:4,10; and the similar phrase ύπό κυρίου appears in Matt 1:22; 2:15; Acts 10:33; 1 Cor 7:25; 11:32; 2 Thess 2:13. The NT authors are much more comfortable using διά to introduce the Spirit of God or Christ (1 Cor 2:10; 2 Cor 5:18; Phil 1:11; Heb 2:3; 1 John 4:9; 1 Pet 4:11). In Paul, διά does introduce God several times in connection with choosing or commissioning of Christ-believers (Gal 1:1; 4:7; 1 Cor 1:1, 9; Eph 1:1; cf. 2T1m 1:1), but this seems to be a distinctively Pauline pattern. Other writers still use ύπό in these contexts (Acts 10:41, 42; Heb 5:4, 10). The instrumental sense appears in, e.g., Aristeas 36, 56, 61, 74, 104, 126, 127, 128, 142, 147, 148, 151, 154, 155, 165, 168, 192, 264, 266, 271, 285, 304, 315. When the "means" involved is an abstract character quality or a manner of acting, this instrumental use of διά with the genitive becomes indistinguishable from a dative of manner (see Aristeas Aristeas 28, 225, 252, 265, 276; cf. LXX Josh 15:13; 19:50; so BDAG, 224 [A.3.b]). When διά introduces a human agent, this figure is usually the intermediary or assistant through whom an event is accomplished (so BDAG, 225 [A.4.a]; see perhaps Aristeas 103, 114 and Philo, Abr. 115). 35י See Aristeas 17, 131, 139, 192, 197, 199, 234, 239, 285, 287.</page><page sequence="10">10 I. W Scott /Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 1-28 authors otherwise consistent usage.36 This all suggests that the author's avoidance of ύπό here is deliberate. What would be gained by selecting διά to express God's involvement in the law's composition? We may gain a sense of the writer's intent when we examine the few parallel uses of διά in the LXX of the Pentateuch. In LXX Gen 4:1 Eve gives birth to Cain and then declares έκτησάμην άνθρωπον διά τοΰ θεοΰ. This does not mean that God fathered her child. God is not solely, or even directly, responsible for Cain's conception. Rather, the translator chooses διά to express the fact that God made the birth possible, granting her womb fertility so that the human process of procreation could bear its natural fruit. Similarly, in LXX Exod 22:8(9) Moses tells Israel that a convicted thief must pay double reparation διά τοΰ θεοΰ. Here again, it is not God who makes the payment. Rather, God's presence with the people (and perhaps the acompanying threat of divine retribution) is the ultimate basis and motivation for the guilty party's payment.37 It seems, then, that Jewish writers occasionally used the 36) Notice that in other Jewish literature it is always ύπό that introduces God as the agent giving Torah (1 Esdr 8:3; 9:39) or speaking through the scriptural prophets (Matt 1:22; 2:15; 22:31). More generally God is always introduced by ύπό when he speaks (LXX Josh 24:27; Josephus, Ant. 1.213; 2.218), commands (Josephus, Ant. 3.7; Acts 10:33), prom ises (Acts 26:6, Gal 3:17), or teaches (Pss. Sol. 6:2; 17:32). 37) The one other instance of δια τοϋ θεοΰ in the LXX Pentateuch is less clear, but seems to confirm the same general pattern of use. In LXX Gen 40:8 Joseph asks asks Pharaoh a rhetorical question regarding his disturbing dreams: οΰχί διά τοΰ θεοΰ ή διασάφησις αύτών έσ·πν. Although this statement is ambiguous, it would make good sense if the preposition were understood to introduce the indirect cause or origin of the interpreta tion: "Does their interpretation not have its source in God?" Alternately, we could take this as an instance of the special use of διά τοΰ θεοΰ for prophetic requests for God's guid ance (see below n. 39). A clearer parallel to Gen 4:1 and Exod 22:8(9) comes in LXX Jer 3:23, where the prophet says "Israel's salvation comes from the Lord our God" (διά κυρίου θεοΰ ήμών ή σωτηρία τοΰ Ίσραηλ). Once more this unusual turn of phrase makes good sense if it expresses Gods role as the one who made the events possible, set them in motion, but did not carry them through himself (cf. LXX Isa 51:20). After all, the deliverance to which Jeremiah refers is the liberation of the exiled Judeans, an act performed by Cyrus the Great. See also Eupolemus' fictional letter from Solomon to the Egyptian king, in which we read that Solomon has inherited the throne διά τοΰ θεοΰ τοΰ μεγίστου (Eupolemus, Mos.Mos. 2.9; cf. 2.11). Equally striking is the choice of διά to express Gods agency in making the Canaanites determined to destroy Israel: διά κυρίου έγένετο κατισχΰσαι αύτών την καρδίαν συνανταν εις πόλεμον προς Ισραήλ (LXX Josh 11:20). The translator's choice of διά seems motivated by a desire to avoid a strict predestination in which the Canaanites acted merely as puppets for God's will. Instead, it seems to express God's mysterious involvement in directing human "hearts" without overriding their decisions.</page><page sequence="11">I. W.

Like Eve's child and the thief's reparation, the law is not sim ply made by God himself. In some less direct way God's presence and In fact, the author of Aristeas seems to employ διά for a similar kind of indirect cause or source in 36 and 122. In these cases the agent involved is not God, but they confirm that the writer is familiar with this sense of the preposition. 38) This use of διά, being so rare, is not well recognized in the grammars and iexica. Danker does suggest, though, that "[a]t times διά w[ith the] gen[itive] seems to have a causal meaning" (BDAG, 225 [A.5]). Elsewhere, Danker recognizes that διά can intro duce an "attendant or prevailing circumstance" (BDAG, 224 [A.3.c]). Since such a cir cumstance is sometimes necessary for the event of the main verb, this circumstantial sense and the causal use can become virtually indistinguishable. Among NT commentators, Ernest DeW. Burton (A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Letter to the Galatians [Edinburgh: Τ. &amp; T. Clark, 1921], 6) identifies a similar use of διά to introduce "that which, so to speak, stands behind the action and renders it possible." 39, Aside from Gen 4:1; 40:8; Exod 22:8(9) and the similar uses discussed above, the phrases διά τοΰ θεοΰ and διά τοΰ κυρίου only appear in the LXX as part of an idiom for God as the object of a prophetic request (Judg 1:1; 1 Sam 22:10, 13, 15; 23:2, 4; 28:6; 30:8; 2 Sam 5:19, 23; Isa 29:15; Jer 3:23; 1 Chron 14:10; see also "διά," BDAG, 225 [A.3.f] and Lives of the Prophets 4.8). in Aristeas 313, though, the phrase does not modify a verb of entreaty. Moreover, the motifs of Demetrius' speech reflect an idealization of Moses as philosopher, not as a prophet. The only other use we find among Jewish authors comes in the Pauline letters, where God's agency in election is expressed with διά (Gal 1:1; 4:7; 1 Cor 1:1,9; cf. Eph 1:1; Col 1:1; 2 Tim 1:1). Again, though, the context is different in Aristeas 313, and these Pauline passages reflect a consistent (if idiosyncratic) pattern rather than an isolated shift in word-use. Philo does suggest a different distinction between the phrases ύπό θεοΰ and διά θεοΰ, insisting that the latter denotes God's immanent involvement as the direct cause of event (Leg.(Leg.(Leg. 1.41; Cher. 1.127, 130; cf. Ebr. 1.120). In a back-handed way, though, the philoso pher recognizes that the LXX translators had employed the phrase διά τοΰ θεοΰ "inappro priately" for situations in which God is rightly understood as the first cause rather than an immanent agent {Cher. 1.128). In fact, this usage seems to arise only where Philo feels the need to explain the apparently poor word-choice of the LXX. Where Philo is not prompted by this apologetic need, he always uses ύπό to express God's agency (see above, n. 33). So not only does Philo's neat explanation fail to reflect the practice of any other Jewish writer, it does not even reflect his own diction. It is an exercise in wishful lexicography.</page><page sequence="12">12 I.W. Scott / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 1-28 activity make Moses' act of legislation possible. To be sure, God is in volved with the law from its inception, but Demetrius seems careful to avoid the claim that God was its author. Why is Demetrius discussing these attempts to publish the law, then, if not to demonstrate its divine authorship and so add weight to its author ity? Actually, at this late stage in the narrative the law's authority is already well established.40 The aim of Demetrius' speech is, rather, to explain why such wise writings have gone largely unnoticed in the Hellenistic world. This is, after all, the question which prompts Demetrius' account (312). What is his explanation? Simply that God did not want such profound wisdom opened up to all and sundry. The root problem with Theopom pus' plan to borrow from Israel's law is that the teaching would become accessible "to common people" (εις κοινούς ανθρώπους) (315). To be sure, God is actively involved with the law. The concern, though, is not to explain the law's origins but to explain its lack of influence in the broad Hellenistic tradition. Nor does this divine protection of the law necessarily imply direct div ine authorship. Demetrius' explanation is not endebted to biblical trad itions, but to the common Hellenistic and Roman idea that profound wisdom should only be unveiled to those who are properly prepared. The mysteries, for example, involved rites and teachings which could never be unveiled to outsiders. Apuleius, in his Metamorphoses, stops short of reporting the details of his initiations, explaining that if he did "both ears and tongue would incur equal punishment (parem noxam contraherent)" (11.23).41 After the most cursory summary of those rites he warns his readers that they "must pretend not to know it" and promises from that point on to tell them "only what can be expounded to the minds of the uninitiated {ad profanorum intelligentias) without atonement (sine piac ulo)"ulo)" (Metam. 18.23). Philostratus, in his biography of Apollonius of Tyana, emphasizes that the wisest teaching in the world, the teaching of the Brahman sages, is only accessible to those who undergo an arduous 40) This is the case even if we understand Aristeas as an apology for the LXX of the Penta teuch. The "law" being discussed here by Demetrius is not the LXX translation, but rather the subject matter of the Hebrew text as it was known through previous translations. 411 The translation of Apuleius here is by Hanson (Apuleius. Metamorphoses [transl. John Arthur Hanson; 2 vols.; LCL; Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1989]), except that I have rendered noxa as "punishment" instead of "guilt." The idea seems to be not simply that Apuleius and the hearer will be guilty of a crime, but that the organs which committed the crime will suffer for it.</page><page sequence="13">I. W. Scott / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 13 journey to the limits of the East. Even Damis, Apollonius' faithful disci pie, is left outside the Brahman's fortress because he has not ascended to the purity of mind required to gain entry to these secrets (Life of Apollo niusnius 3.12-13). Although these texts post-date Aristeas by a wide margin, the same theme was already well established when Philo referred to Moses' special initiation to receive the law's mysteries.42 Indeed, the secretive nature of the famous Eleusinian mysteries was common knowledge as far back as the 6th c. B.C.E.43 Likewise, Pythagoras had long been thought to have instructed his followers in riddles and symbols, guaranteeing that only his circle of disciples could understand what they heard.44 The author of Aristeas draws on this broad tradition in 313-317 to turn one of the law's chief deficits into a sign of its profound value. The code of Moses has not been ignored because it is second-rate. On the contrary, it is so wise that God ensures its contents will not be exposed to the unprepared masses. Yet in this same Hellenistic tradition, the wise secrets are often human discoveries. No deity taught Apollonius or Pythagoras their philosophy. The concern to guard their wisdom arises from the quality of their con tents, not the nature of their composition. So, if this broad Hellenistic tradition lies behind Demetrius' speech, there is no reason to presume that such divine protection of the law would be associated with its divine authorship at all. It is enough that the legislation contains wisdom about "divine matters."45 Fortunately, Aristeas does contain much more explicit discussions of the law's composition and it is to those passages that we now turn. 42י Philo, Mos. 1.62; cf. Somn. 1.164. 431 See R. L. Gordon, "Mysteries," OCD3, 1017-18. 441 See C. H. Kahn, "Pythagoras, Pythagoreanism," OCD3, 1283-85. 451 Aristeas spoke in the beginning of his account of his ongoing investigation into such "divine things" (τά θεία) (3). Even if we take "divine" (θείος) here to indicate the quality of the law's teaching, rather than just its contents, we have already observed that such "divine" quality was often attributed to human artefacts in the Hellenistic world. In keep ing with the affinity for ring composition and indusio in Aristeas, we find a close parallel to 313-317 early on in the narrative, in section 31. There the "divine" (θείος) quality of the legislation a matter of its being "most philosophical" (φιλοσοφωτέρος) and "flawless" (ακέραιος).</page><page sequence="14">14 I. W. Scott/Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 III. Eleazar's Account of the Law's Origins Where Aristeas does address the law's origins we are told explicitly that the books are human compositions, products of a great human mind. In his explanation of the law, the Jewish high priest Eleazar tells Aristeas and his gentile friends that Moses was gifted with exceptional insight. The Israel ite was "equipped by God (ΰπό θεοΰ κατεσκευασμένος) to understand everything (εις έπίγνωσιν των απάντων)" (139). Because Moses "was wise" (σοφός ών) he was able to "survey each matter" (συνθεωρήσας... έκαστα) (139). It was then on the basis of these intellectual insights that Moses saw the danger posed by foreigners and "surrounded" the people with the "unbreakable barriers" of the law's requirements (139). The high priest seems to be saying that God gave Moses an unusually agile mind, but then left the legislator to work out for himself the kind of law that would make Israel righteous and pious. Can we be sure that Moses' "survey" of life was, for the author of Aris teas,teas, a rational activity? Notice that Eleazar's comments about Moses' inquiries come just after the high priest has outlined the lawgiver's argu ments for monotheism. Moses began, Eleazar tells us, by "first demon strating" (προϋπέδειξε) that "God is one" and is sovereign (132). Next, Moses "demonstrated" (εδειξεν) that moral guilt accompanies even the thought of sin (133). Having established this "premise" (καταρχήν) for argument, he proceeded to "demonstrate" (δείξας) the folly of gentile idolatry (134).46 It is this kind of reasoned reflection that Eleazar seems to envision in 139 when he then tells us that Moses' legislation was based on his own "survey" of the world. We do not catch even a whiff of divine rev elation in any of this. Instead we see Moses the philosopher applying his great mind to comprehend the world and then framing Israel's law on the basis of his own rational understanding. This presentation of Moses stands in stark contrast to the tendency in other Egyptian Jewish works to depict him as a prophet. Philo explains that the stipulations of the law were all "given by prophecy" (θεσπισθέντος) (Mos. 2.34).47 Elsewhere he says that Moses "declared an inspired oracle" (έπιθειάσας άποφθέγγεται λόγιον) when he gave Israel the Sabbath regulations (Mos. 2.263). In Mos. 2.188 the Alexandrian philoso pher distinguishes three species of prophetic inspiration and associates at 46) For καταρχή as "premise" for an argument see Chrysippus, Frag. 911.88; Philodemus, On On Piety 14 (DDG p. 547b 3) ("καταρχή," LSJ, 910 [IV]). 471 English translations of Philo are my own.</page><page sequence="15">I.

At times laws were "spoken by God in his own person (έκ προσώπου τοΰ θεοΰ λέγεται) with his prophet for interpreter (δι' έρμηνέως τοΰ θείου προφήτου)" {Mos. 2.188). Philo is probably thinking here of the Decalogue, and perhaps also of the "special laws."48 More often, though, Israel's lawgiver engaged in a dialogue of "question and answer," posing direct questions to the deity regarding what rulings to enact and receiving an immediate answer.49 Philo is also willing to grant that Moses sometimes experienced dissociative or ecstatic posses sion by God's Spirit, though it is ambiguous how much the philosopher wants to connect these less rational events with the giving ofTorah.50 Still, Philo clearly identifies prophecy of one kind or another as the source of the laws. Winston is right that Philo, in keeping with tendencies in Stoic thought, has re-interpreted most prophecy as operating through Moses' 48י So David Winston, "Two Types of Mosaic Prophecy according to PhiJ0,"/5/&gt;4 (1989): 49-67 (49); Mos. 2.188. Hindy Najman suggests that the first category includes both the Decalogue and its interpretation in the special laws (Seconding Sinai: The Development of Mosaic Mosaic Discourse in Second Temple Judaism [Leiden: Brill, 2003], 105). Winston is likely right, though, that Philo is only thinking here of the special laws, since elsewhere he insists that the Decalogue did not come through any intermediary or interpreter (see Spec. 3.7; Praem.Praem. 2; Decal. 19). 4" Mos. 2.188-191 (esp. 2.188). Philo explains the nature of the question-and-answer mode of prophecy in Mos. 2.192: "The prophet asks a question under divine possession (ενθουσιά πυνθανόμενος), and the Father renders the oracle (θεσπίζει), giving him a share of speech and answer." 50' Moses is sometimes "possessed by God (έπιθειάσαντος) and carried away out of him self (έξ αΰτοΰ κατασχεθέντος)" (Mos. 2.188). Such mantic activity is also evident in Mos. 1.175-176, 201; 2.67, 272, 275, 280, 288. Winston ("Two Types," 49-54) argues that this third category of "divine utterance" includes only predictions of future events and does not concern legislation at all. In part this is because of the focus on prediction in Mos.Mos. 1.190, and in part it is because of Moses' lucid mental activity in the four following examples of legislative inspiration. Yet Philo says that he will illustrate, in these examples, the question and answer mode of revelation, "interweaving with it the third kind (συνυφήνας αύτοΐς και τό τρίτον είδος), in which the speaker appears under that divine possession (τό τοΰ λέγοντος ενθουσιώδες) in virtue of which he is chiefly and in the strict sense considered a prophet" (Mos. 1.191). This would suggest that, in Philo's understand ing, some element of ecstasy is involved in Moses' legislation that, e.g., those who curse God should be stoned (Mos. 2.208). Moreover, the complete dissociation and uncon sciousness associated by Winston with the Greek conception of mantic prophecy is likely overstated (compare Winston, "Two Types," 52-54 with C. Forbes, Prophecy and Inspired Speech Speech in Early Christianity and Its Hellenistic Environment [Tubingen: Mohr, 1995], 126-81).</page><page sequence="16">16 I.W. Scott /Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 own rational processes.51 It is far from clear, though, that the Alexandrian has done away with divine intervention entirely, simply identifying Philo's own philosophical insight as "prophecy" because his reason penetrates the sphere of the divine nous?1 One could read Mos. 2.67 in this sense, where Moses' philosophical prowess prepares him to be "inspired by a passion from heaven" (καταπνευσθείς ύπ' έρωτος ουρανίου), receiving "oracles" (χρησιμοΐς) in which he is "taught (άναδιδασκόμενος) everything about the rites and sacred tasks of his service" (Mos. 2.67).53 If Philo is assuming here a demythologized view of prophecy, though, he does not work very hard to guard against a more supernatural reading. Similarly, Philo does depict Moses as formulating the Sabbath laws himself after observing pat terns in God's daily gift of manna (Mos. 2.263). Here, though, the law giver's human intellectual contribution is deliberately subordinated to God's overpowering influence. Moses, he tells us, was only able to recog nize the "hidden reality" (άδηλούμενον) concerning the Sabbath because God "testified" (μαρτυρηθέντι) about it "through a visible sign" (Mos. 2.263). True, this explanation recalls the Stoic understanding of divina tion as rational skill in interpreting regular signs built by the deity into the physical universe.54 Philo emphasizes, though, that the legislator did not really achieve these insights by his own "conjecture" (ουκ έστοχάσατο) (Mos.(Mos. 2.264). Rather he was "guided by God" (θεοφορηθείς), so that when he declared the Sabbath regulations he "spoke prophetically" (έθέσπισε) (Mos. 2.264).55 Philo is certainly drawing intellectual activity into Moses' prophetic gift here, but the philosopher also seems to make a distinction between this "inspired" thought and ordinary reflection—a distinction based not on the degree of Moses' genius but on God's inter vention.56 All of this seems, though, to illustrate only the "interpretive" 511 Winston, "Two Types," 56-57. Undoubtedly, Winston is right that Philo wants to explain Moses' prophecy largely in terms of the rational mind's "seeing" into the invisible realm of the λόγος and the forms. 521 Winston, "Two Types," 49-67. See above n. 43. 53) For a further exploration of the exalted identity of Moses in Philo s biography, see Ian W. Scott, "Is Philo's Moses a Divine Man?" SPhA 14 (2002): 87-111, esp. 104-9. 54) See, e.g., Cicero, Nat. d., 2.7-12. 551 Philo continues: "I need hardly say that such inferences (είκασίαι) are the relatives of prophecy (συγγενείς προφητείας). For the mind would never work with such keen accu racy (οΰτως εΰσκόπως εύθυβόλησεν) if some divine spirit (θείον πνεΰμα) were not also guiding (ποδηγετούν) it toward the truth itself" (Mos. 2.265). The inferences Moses might arrive at on his own initiative are only "relatives" (συγγενείς) of prophecy, not iden ticaltical to prophecy (pace Winston, "Two Types," 60). 561 Hence even Winston concedes that Philo fails to follow through on whatever rational</page><page sequence="17">I. W. Scott / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 17 species of prophecy. Where "question and answer" discourse is involved, Philo seems to envision a clear intervention of God which cannot be col lapsed into the legislator's own insight. At one point we find Moses "at a loss" (άπορων) over what penalty to give a Sabbath-breaker. He brings the question to God, and receives in answer a specific punishment that ought to be laid down in the law (Mos. 2.217-218).57 So, no matter how much we think Philo intends to rationalize the "interpretive" prophecy behind Torah, there remains for him a series of divine interventions which fur nish Moses with key elements of this superior law. Nor is it just the ideas underlying the law which are inspired. In Spec. 4.38-39 Philo praises the pedagogical sequence in which Moses unfolds the various commands. The Alexandrian explains, though, that this discursive "harmony" (άρμονίαν) was "declared in an oracle which came from God's presence" (την δε των χρησμω θεσπισθηναί φησιν έκ προσώπου τοΰ θεοΰ) (Spec. 4.39). Philo then offers a quotation from Lev 19:11-12 as an illustration of the oracle's contents. Here even the rhetorical presentation and the specific wording of the law seems to have been dictated in places by God. Philo would undoubtedly say that this was an inaudible dictation, perceived directly by Moses' rational mind. Yet the Alexandrian has shown a concern to highlight the central place of God's ongoing intervention in the framing of the Jewish law.58 Its authority is tied, for Philo, to the discourse of prophecy. ization of prophecy he has begun ("Two Types," 58). It is dangerous to treat Philo's more philosophical passages as his real outlook, dismissing his use of more traditional and literal discourse about Moses' prophecy as a product of his "conservative religious bent" ("Two Types," 58). Philo's Middle Platonism mingles awkwardly with his literal reading of the Pentateuch precisely because of his deliberate refusal to let go of the latter. 57) Philo tells us that by means of his "unseen spirit" (άοράτφ ψυχή), he "came before . . . the judgement-seat and asked (έπυνθάνετο) the judge who knows all things before he hears them what sentence he had passed. That judge declared his decision (ό δ' άποφαίνεται την γνώσιν) that the man should die" (Mos. 2.217-218). This is an example of the "question and answer" mode of revelation described in 2.188, and Philo distin guishes it from the lawgiver's independent prophetic "sight" which initially recognized the sacredness of the seventh day (Mos. 2.209-211). 58) Such clear, deliberate attribution of the Pentateuch's surface features to God should, again, warn us against Winston's suggestion that "the scriptural idiom of divine interven tionism" is only retained as a reflex of Philo's "conservatism" ("Two Types," 59). A similar special pleading seems to be involved in Winston's dismissal of (apparently) clear attribu tions of the law to divine intervention in QG 3.9; 4.196 ("Two Types," 65 n. 20). The immediacy of God's intervention in the case of the Decalogue is emphasized in Spec. 3.7; Pracm. 2; Decal. 19.</page><page sequence="18">18 I.W.

In Wisdom of Solomon we find Wisdom leading Israel out of Egypt "by the hand of a holy prophet" (έν χειρι προφήτου αγίου) (Wis 11:1).59 The commands observed by Israel are "her laws" (νόμοι αύτης) (Wis 6:18; cf. 16:6), given by the same divine hypostasis whose "all-powerful hand... created the world out of formless matter" (11:17).60 While both Philo and the author of Wisdom are writing a cen tury or more after the author of Aristeas, we already glimpse a similar ten dency toward the prophetic in the fragmentary remains of earlier writers. When the tragic poet Ezekiel depicts the burning bush incident in his Exagoge,Exagoge, Gods speech to Moses includes detailed regulations for the Pass over festival (167-192). Aristobulus, likewise, identifies Moses as the man "who received aphorisms from God in the form of a double law" (έκ θεόθεν γνώμησι λαβών κατά δίπλακα θεσμόν) (Frag. 4; Eusebius, Praep. ev.ev. 13.12.5)." In light of this strong Alexandrian tradition, the absence of any proph etic element in Eleazar's depiction of Moses and the law cannot be mere oversight. It implies the author's deliberate rejection of the prophetic model for Moses' work. Even where Eleazar is concerned to explain the more obscure requirements of Torah, the high priest points not to the law's divine origin but rather to its demonstrable rationality.62 He "dem onstrates" (προϋπέδειξε) the truth of the law's monotheism (132). He goes on to defend the wisdom of the food and clothing laws by showing how they are "established in keeping with natural reason" (προς τον 591 Cf. Alexander Polyhistors epitome of Eupolemus, Frag. 2 (Eusebius, Praep. ev. 9.30.1). Alexander explains that, according to Eupolemus, Moses "prophesied" (προφητεΰσαι) for 40 years. 60י Cf. Wis 18:4, 9 where Israel is said to keep the law (νόμος) in resisting idolatry and polytheism. Indeed, the law is something originating with God/Wisdom, and Israel is merely the medium "through whom" (δι' cbv) it was "given to the world" (τω αίώνι δίδοσθαι) (18:9). 6" English translation is my own. 621 We need not decide here whether Aristeas is primarily an intra-Jewish polemic in sup port of the LXX translation (as was initially proposed by V. Tcherikover, "The Ideology of the Letter of Aristeas," HTR 51 [1958]: 59-85; see also, e.g., Boccaccini, Middle Judaism, 164, 167) or whether it includes an extra-mural apologetic motive (a view revived in recent decades by, e.g., Barclay, Mediterranean Diaspora, 148-49; Mary Ann L. Beavis, "Anti-Egyptian Polemic in the Letter of Aristeas 130-165," JSJ 18 [1987]: 145-51). In either case the author is, along the way, demonstrating to his audience that the law can be part of a Jewish identity which is acceptable in the wider Hellenistic community of Egypt.</page><page sequence="19">I. W. Scott / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 19 φυσικόν λόγον...καθέστηκεν) (143; cf. 171). Every rule "has a profound reason for it" (εχει λόγον βαθύν) (143; cf. 161).63 Perhaps the closest ana logue to this apologetic element of Eleazar's speech is found in Aristo bulus' defence of the Pentateuch's anthropomorphism {Frag. 2; Eusebius, Praep.Praep. ev. 8.10.12). Even there, however, the author makes a point of dis cussing God's fiery descent on Mount Sinai "when the law was given" (καθ' δν ένομοθέτει καιρόν) (Frag. 2). Eleazar's silence about any such supernatural revelations seems to be no accident. The impression that the law is, in Aristeas, an artefact of human reason is further reinforced by the way Eleazar consistently casts Moses, not God, as the agent behind its composition. Moses is the "legislator" (νομοθέτης) of Israel (Aristeas 139, 144). It is Moses who "enacted" (νομοθετέω) the laws (144; 161; cf. 240) and "commands" (κελεύει) Israel in the Penta teuch (158, 159, 160).64 Yet for most other Jewish Greek writers these are roles carried out by God, the law's true author.65 Granted, Philo affirms a strong model of prophetic revelation and yet also feels free in many pas sages to make Moses the agent of legislating activity.66 This is a symptom, no doubt, of the extent to which Philo understands prophecy to be medi ated through the rational human mind. Yet these passages are juxtaposed with others in which God "legislates" (νομοθετέω) (Mos. 2.192, 218; Leg. 3.142; Post. 1.143; Fug. 1.77; Spec. 1.117, 140; Virt. 1.121), "puts into effect" (προστάττει) {Mos. 2.202), "commands" (κελεύει) {Spec. 1.115), etc. All of this emphasizes God's active, sometimes interventionist, role.67 631 Notice, too, the author's emphasis on the way educated Gentiles agree with these claims. Demetrius, for example, calls the law "very philosophical and genuine (καΐ φιλοσοφωτέραν...καιφιλοσοφωτέραν...και άκέραιον)" (31). Cf. 133, 170. Μ) Moses is the subject of similar verbs throughout Eleazar's speech: e.g., 147, 148, 153, 155, 157, 158, etc. The only exceptions to this pattern throughout Aristeas are those in which the law itself is the subject who commands or addresses Israel (e.g., 168). 65) See νομοθετέω in 2 Macc 3:15; 4 Macc 5:25; κελεύω in Jdt 2:15; 2 Macc 15:4; Jose phus,phus, Ant. 3.91. 661 Moses is said to "legislate" (νομοθετέω) in Philo, Fug. 1.185; Mos. 2.9; Decal. 1.9; Spec. 1.161; 1.161; 4.105; Virt. 1.81, 125. In the law Moses also "chooses" (αίρέομαι) (Spec. 1.162), "commands" (κελεύω) (Spec. 2.105), "does not allow" (ούκ άφίημι) (Spec. 2.106), and "speaks" (φήμι) (Spec. 4.105). 671 Notice how Philo prioritizes such divine leading over Moses' own intellect in Mos. 2.11. There we hear that the legislator "could not have composed" (συνέγραψεν) the scriptures "under God's guidance" (ύφηγησαμένου θεοϋ) if it were not for his unusual intellectual endowment and preparation. In other words, Moses' intellect is a necessary</page><page sequence="20">20 I. W. Scott /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 Even where Moses is the agent instituting the law, we find reminders of his prophetic inspiration. In Spec. 2.104, for example, Moses is also called "ό τους νόμους ήμΐν προφητεύσας." Likewise, in Virt. 1.119 Philo identi fies Moses as the one trying to instil virtue "through his whole code of laws" (δια πάσης της νομοθεσίας). Immediately, though, Philo also calls him "the most holy prophet" (ό ίερώτατος προφήτης).68 Indeed, the phil osopher sometimes blurs the line between Moses' prophetic agency and God's own agency to such an extent that it is unclear who Philo means to stand as subject of a particular legislating act.69 In Eleazar's account of Torah, by contrast, no one other than Moses is the agent behind Israel's law. The picture of Moses as the law's author is not paired with any balan cing discussion of God's "legislation" or of prophetic inspiration. So, although the author of Aristeas is hardly the only one to call Moses Israel's "legislator" (νομοθέτης),70 it is in Eleazar's speech that Moses' activity comes closest to the kind of strictly human brilliance displayed by Solon or Lycurgus.71 The net result is a depiction of the Law as an entirely human artefact, shaped from beginning to end by Moses alone. God's involve ment is limited to his having gifted the legislator with a prodigious mind. condition for the law's composition, though not a sufficient condition. The guidance of God is also required to stimulate that mind. 681 Cf. the way in which Josephus begins his Antiquities with the clear affirmation that God is the one who legislates Torah (Josephus, Ant. 1.14), but then elsewhere names Moses as the subject of the same action (Ant. 1.19; 3.266-268, 317; C. Ap. 1.284-285; 2.145). 691 In many passages the ambiguity arises from passive verbs (see νομοθετέω in Spec. 1.82, 198, 299; 2.35, 39; 2.120; 3.80, 136; Virt. 1.97; διατάττεται in Spec. 1.235). Elsewhere the third-person singular subject of verbs denoting legislative action is simply not identi fied for so long that it becomes ambiguous (see νομοθετέω in Spec. 1.233, 234, 235; 2.110, 122, 160, 239; 4.11; Virt. 1.102, 109; κελεύω in Spec. 4.12, 142, 219). The con fusion of divine action with Moses' action is exacerbated by passages in which the law itself "commands" (προστάττει, Spec. 1.137; κελεύω, Virt. 1.95), "allows" (απονέμω, Spec. 2.110), "speaks" (φήμι, Spec. 4.137, 139; Virt. 1.96). 70) See, e.g., Aristobulus, Frag. 2 (Eusebius, Praep. ev. 8.10.3, 6, 9); Philo, Leg. 3.145; Sacr. 1.126; etc.; cf. Josephus, Ant. 1.18; Jas 4:12. 711 Notice, in contrast, that Philo is careful at the outset of On Moses to juxtapose Moses' identification as νομοθέτης with the balancing epithet "interpreter of the holy laws" (έρμηνέως(έρμηνέως νόμων ιερών) (Mos. 1.1). There was an old tradition in Sparta that Lycurgus had received impetus for his legisla tion from the Pythian oracle. Yet writers like Polybius, a rough contemporary of the author of Aristeas, debunked such "superstition" and insisted on the purely human nature of Lycurgus' achievement (Polybius, Hist., 10.2.6-11).</page><page sequence="21">I. W. Scott / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 21 IV. The Nature of the Translators' Work It is equally significant that the actual work of translating the law remains a purely human intellectual endeavour in Aristeas. Great emphasis is placed on the natural ability and education of the translators. They are "skilled (έμπειρους) in matters pertaining to their Law" (32), "men of the highest merit and of excellent education (παιδεία διαφέροντας)" (121). Each member of the team displays "outstanding culture (αγωγή) and pru dence (φρονήσει)" (124). They are "men of integrity and wisdom (δικαίους καΐ σώφρονας)" (125). All of this is necessary because the work of translation is a matter of intellectual care and rigor. When Aristeas first introduces the idea to the king, he suggests that these skilled men work by committee, "looking for the consensus of the majority (τό σύμφωνον έκ των πλειόνων έξετάσαντες)" and thereby achieving "accuracy in the translation (τό κατά την έρμηνείαν ακριβές)" (32).72 When the narrator describes the actual work of the committee, they are depicted as having followed this careful, critical procedure. "They carried out [the work]," we are told, "establishing a consensus on each matter by making comparisons with one another (01 δέ έπετέλουν έκαστα σύμφωνα ποιοΰντες προς έαυτούς ταΐς άντιβολαΐς)" (302). Throughout the book it is presumed that the translators are involved in a fallible intellectual process and so that they will differ at times in their initial translation. The only hint of divine oversight comes in Aristeas' observation that the work was com pleted in 72 days, "just as if this had come about in keeping with some plan (οιονεί κατά πρόθεσίν τινα τοΰ τοιούτου γεγενημένου)" (307). The "just as if" (οιονεί) signals, though, that Aristeas, whose Hellenistic environment was hardly averse to the idea of divine providence, is less than convinced that this timing is anything other than coincidence.73 The 721 Shutt takes the participial clause τό σύμφωνον έκ των πλειόνων έξετάσαντες (32) as a reference to textual criticism, prior to the actual work of translation (R. J. H. Shutt, "Let ter of Aristeas," in OTP, 2.7-34). Clearly, though, the following participial clause is con cerned with the translation (την έρμηνείαν). Hence we should understand all of paragraph 32 to be describing the process of translation itself (so Hadas, Aristcas, 110-11). 731 On the openness of Aristeas to the general idea of divine providence in human activity, note the narrators repeated emphasis on God as the one who elevates the king to power and sustains his kingdom in peace (15, 219). Notice the similar statement of the author's contemporary, Polybius, in Hist. 29.21.9. Referring to Demetrius' anticipation of the Macedonians' eventual downfall, the historian says that Demetrius "prophesied" (άποπεφοίβακεν) and spoke "as if by the mouth of some god" (ώσανεΐ θείω τινΐ στόματι). This seems, however, to be a hyperbolic way of</page><page sequence="22">22 I. W Scott /Journalfor the Study of fudaism 41 (2010) 1-28 character's comment serves, on balance, to bolster the law's vague sense of "divinity" without actually attributing any functional role to God in the work of translation. All of this contrasts sharply with the parallel account in Philo (Mos. 2.25-44). There the translators begin by praying for divine aid {Mos. 2.36). Philo tells us that they "became just as if possessed (καθάπερ ένθυσιώντες) and prophesied (προεφήτευον), not each one something dif ferent, but all the same words and phrases, as though dictated (ένηχοΰντος) to each invisibly by a prompter" (Mos. 2.37). Again, how ever Philo might explain the nature of this "dictation," his point is that God intervened, in response to prayer, and influenced the specific word ing of the new translation. Hence the philosopher calls the translators "prophets and priests (ίεροφάντας και προφήτας)" (2.40). It is of particu lar interest that Philo ties the translators' method explicitly to the mode of the law's original composition. He explains that they are receptive to such divine inspiration because of their affinity with "the purest of spirits (καθαρωτάτφ πνεΰματι), the spirit of Moses" (2:40). The translators could act as prophets in rendering the law into Greek because they were like Moses, who first received the law by prophetic inspiration. This connection between the translators' activity and Moses' original legislating makes it all the more significant that no such talk of inspira tion appears in Aristeas' account. The Jewish translators are characterized in Aristeas by intellectual acumen, not mantic or prophetic abilities. The king's seven-day banquet for the translators is modeled after the philo sophical symposia popularized by Plato and Xenophon (172-300). In this context the translators are praised for their "great natural ability (μεγάλην εΰφυίαν) for the discussions (τάς ομιλίας)" (122).74 As rational thinkers "they had risen above arrogance and an attitude of superiority toward other people, and they joined in the discussion (την.,.όμιλίαν), listening to and answering each person as they ought to" (122). Near the end of the banqueting Aristeas remarks at the speed with which they can answer the most difficult philosophical questions (295-296), and he admits to emphasizing the philosopher's acute insight, particularly given Polybius' own lack of respect for "superstitious" claims of revelation (cf. Hist. 10.2.6-11). 741 741 I take τάς ομιλίας here, early in line 122 to refer not to "the negotiations" between the Judeans and Ptolemy's people (so Shutt, "Aristeas," 21), but rather to "the conversations" which follow immediately on this statement in Aristeas' narrative. Cf. the use of the same word in the singular later in the same line.</page><page sequence="23">I. W. Scott / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 23 "accepting the force of their argument (άποδεξάμενος αυτών την τοΰ λόγου δύναμιν)" (297). It is through this superior rationality that the translation is produced in Aristeas. So, as in Philo, the translators' work is parallel in nature to the original activity of Moses the legislator. In Aris teas,teas, however, the link is forged not on the basis of common prophetic gifts, but on the basis of human intellectual skill.75 V. Sinai's Silenced Thunder Perhaps the most striking aspect of Aristeas, upon reflection, is that it fails to mention Moses' ascent up Mount Sinai even once. This is particularly surprising since we do seem to find throughout Aristeas a deliberate set of allusions to neighbouring incidents in the book of Exodus. Sylvie Honig man has noted that Aristeas seems to be structured around three episodes which parallel the Exodus events.76 First, we find that the Jews have been taken to Egypt as slaves and we witness their liberation (12-27; 33-37). Second, we see the selection of elders from all the twelve tribes of Israel (46-30). A deliberate allusion to Exodus at this point would explain the odd presumption that there are elders to be found in Jerusalem even from the lost northern tribes.77 The third episode in this triptych of intertextual connections with Exodus then sets the elders' reception and endorsement of the new translation alongside the Exodus generation's reception of the original Torah at the foot of the mountain (308-311). As Orlinsky has noted, the Alexandrian elders' ratification of the new translation in Aris teas teas makes specific ritual and verbal allusions to Israel's acceptance of Torah in Exod 24:3-7.78 This large-scale alignment of the translation 75י Notice that in 122 the translators gain their intellectual acumen "through the law" (δια τοϋ νόμου) (cf. 161). 76י Sylvie Honigman, Septuagint and Homeric Scholarship in Alexandria: A Study in the Narrative Narrative ofthe Letter ofAristeas (New York: Routledge, 2003), 53-59. 771 So Orlinsky, "Holy Writ," 98; Honigman, Septuagint, 57. Honigman (Septuagint, 58) is likely right that the author ofAristeas is forced to the number 72 for the elders (instead of the biblical 70) by his desire to have the Jewish delegation fit the Hellenistic civic prac tice, in which each tribe would be represented by an equal number of delegates. On the other hand, the figure of six delegates from each tribe, unusual in Hellenistic political assemblies, is evidence of the writers attempt to come as close as possible to a parallel for the 70 elders of Exodus. 78) Similar formulae are also found in the elders' adoption of Josiah's "Book of the Law" in 2 Kings 23:1-3, as well as in the post-exilic community's embrace of the Torah in Neh</page><page sequence="24">24 I. W Scott /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 narrative with the narrative of Exodus would thus serve to undergird the author's claim that the LXX translation carries the status of authoritative scripture in its own right, not merely as an echo of the Hebrew original.79 If Honigman is correct, then the process of translating the law would stand as an intertextual equivalent of the original reception ofTorah. In that case, one must again be impressed by the complete absence of any reference to revelatory experiences, either in Moses' own activity or in the project of translation. Right where we expect to find the thunder and lightning of God's revelatory presence at the summit of Mount Sinai, we find instead gifted human beings at work. At the same time, we need to take seriously the implication that the author of Aristeas expects at least some members of the audience to have that supernatural encounter at Sinai in mind. Rather than simply eclipsing the Exodus narrative of Moses' encounter with God, the writer 0f Aristeas seems implicitly to offer a radical reinterpretation of the story. To the extent that the lawgivers encounter with God on the mountain hovers in the background of Eleazar's speech and the translators' work, that encounter is explained as a figure for the fact that Moses' great intellect found its origin in God. Moses' entry into the cloud on the mountain's summit is treated as a met aphor for the legislator's entry, by means of divine reason, into the very truth and wisdom of the Creator. It is difficult to avoid hearing here an echo of Stoic doctrine, in which human rationality was in fact an encoun ter with the world-structuring logos. Epictetus, for instance, simply takes it for granted that to know what is the rational action in any situation is to know the will of God.80 It may be, then, that the author of Aristeas still 8:1-6. These two passages also seem, however, to depict a later generation as re-enacting the decision of the elders at Sinai. Orlinsky suggests that the words '"to read aloud to (lit. to read in the ears/hearing of) the people' (קרא...באזני העם), usually followed by an expression of consent by the assembly, describes the biblical procedure in designating a document as official and binding" ("Holy Writ," 94). While Orlinskys basic point is well taken, it is important to separate, in a way that Orlinsky does not, the peoples acceptance of of a document as authoritative from the assumption that the document is "divinely inspired" (94). 79) So Orlinsky, "Holy Writ," 96-100; Honigman, Septuagint, 53; See also Benjamin G. Wright III, "Translation as Scripture," in Septuagint Research (ed. W. Kraus and R. G. Wooden; Atlanta: SBL, 2006), 47-61. 801 See, e.g., Epictetus, Diatr. 1.9.4-6; 1.20.12-15. Notice especially how, in 1.29.27-29 Epictetus can move without notice from a discussion of acting rationally to a discussion of what "God does not want" (ό θεός ού βούλεται) in human behaviour and the need to "obey Him who gives the signal" (πείθεσθαι.. .τω σημαίνοντι).</page><page sequence="25">I. W. Scott /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 25 wants to maintain a claim that the law contains a revelation of divine truth. That claim has been radically revised, however, so that the revela tion takes place entirely in and through the human intellect of Moses.81 VI. The ״Oracles of God" Yet three passages in Aristeas seem to confirm that, despite his rationalism, the writer still conceives of Torah as being, in some sense, God's speech. The first is where, after receiving the Torah scrolls for the translation, Ptolemy offers thanks "to the God whose oracles these are (τω θεφ, ούτινος έστν τά λόγια ταΰτα)" (177). The plural expression "oracles," λόγια, is commonly used throughout Greek literature for the utterances of a man tic prophet.82 In Jewish writings the term often denotes an oracular mes sage, like the visions of Balaam (LXX Num 24:4, 16).83 Elsewhere, though, the stress falls not on the mantic mode of God's revelation, but on the bare fact that God has spoken.84 In LXX Ps 11:7 (MT 12:7; Eng. 81) Najman {Seconding Sinai, 103-5) observes this same odd absence, or at least downplay ing, of Sinai in Philo's accounts of Moses' legislation. She suggests, plausibly, that this is due to Philo's view that Moses' Sinai encounter merely gave him access to "the mystery of creation" in which the natural law was ordained. Sinai signifies "the moment at which Moses surpassed the ability of humans in his comprehension of creation" {Seconding Sinai, 105). To this extent Philo seems to echo the move made in Aristeas, though Najman's explanation does not take into account either Philo's heavy emphasis on prophecy or the deliberate parallel between the translation and Moses' original work (see above). In any case, Najman also highlights the way in which it is the miraculous translation of the LXX serves to make "the perfect, written copy of the Law of Nature" accessible to all {Seconding Sinai,Sinai, 104). In this reliance on a moment of divine intervention, Philo pans ways with Aristeas.Aristeas. 82) See, e.g., Herodotus, Hist. 8.62.8; Nicolaus, Frag. 38.16, 21. 83) E.g., Philo, Agr. 1.127; Sobr. 1.50; Conf. 1.81, 166; Migr. 1.196; Her. 1.2, 8; Theodo tus, Frag. 6 (Eusebius, Praep. ev. 9.22.8). The singular is used in Her. 1.113 for the taber nade as a site for oracles. See also the use of λόγια in Josephus,/ W. 6.311, 313 for biblical prophecy, viewed as a set of "oracles." In the digression on the Jerusalem cult, even the author of Aristeas picks up on the Jewish use of the singular λόγιον for the high priest's breastplate, an instrument of the leaders oracular role (Aristeas 97; cf. Josephus, Ant. 3.163,217; 8.93; Philo, Leg. 3.118-119, 126, 132). M) Cf. LXX Ps 17:31 (MT 18:31; Eng. 18:30). More commonly the singular λόγιον car ries this sense of "promise" (see LXX Ps 104[105]:19; 118[119]:38, 41, 50, 58, 76, 82, 116, 123, 140, 169, 170; and perhaps Ps 137[138]:2; Isa 30:27). The term can also be used for ordinary human speech (e.g., LXX Ps 18:15 [MT 19:15; Eng. 19:14]; Philo, Conf. 1.62).</page><page sequence="26">26 I. W Scott /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 12:6) God's λόγια are his "promises" on behalf of the righteous and vul nerable. Hence Jewish writers begin early on to use the plural λογία as a standard label for the body of God's commands. In the LXX of Deut 33:9, for example, God's λογία are set in parallel with his "covenant" (διαθήκη), his "just decrees" (δικαιώματα), and his "law" (νόμος) (Deut 33:9-10).85 In Wis 16:11 God's λόγια are the "commands" which Israel has forgotten in the wilderness.86 Indeed, λόγια becomes one of the repeated expressions for Israel's "law" in the LXX of Ps 118.87 In places Philo can even refer to a Pentateuchal narrative as a λόγιον.88 So by label ing the Pentateuch λόγια, Jews seem often to have expressed a general conviction that the Pentateuch is God's own speech, rather than a specific claim about the mode by which God's words were communicated.89 Returning to Aristeas, we can begin to understand how the author can have Ptolemy, a reliable character in the narrative, call the Pentateuch God's "sayings." In the sequence of the story, the king's statement is already qualified by Eleazar's earlier explanation of the law's composition. The legal code was framed, from beginning to end, by the genius Moses. If, however, the writer of Aristeas understands Moses' prodigious intellect to bring him in direct contact with divine truth, then it would be equally true to say that the legislation has been spoken by God. Yet Ptolemy him self may not realize, at this point in the narrative, exactly how Torah is divine speech. After the king has spent seven days banqueting with the Jewish translators we find him attributing Torah's marvellous contents to "the mind of the lawgiver (την του νομοθέτου διάνοιαν)," that is, Moses (312). These laws are human "accomplishments" (συντετελεσμένα) (312). Ptolemy has, it seems, come to realize that these texts are God's λόγια, not because Moses was a prophet, but because God's sacred realities were per fectly grasped by the human legislator's mind. 85י Here λόγια translates the plural of the Hebrew term אמרה, "saying, word," which itself often comes to mean "command" or "law" ("אמךה," HALOT, 1.67). See also Ps 106(107):11 along with the singular in Ps 147:4(15). 86) Cf. the singular λόγιον which stands in parallel to νόμος in Isa 5:24 (see also 28:13). 87) See Ps 118:11, 103, 148, 158, 162, 172; cf. the singular in 118:67, 133; See also Rom 3:2. 881 The singular λόγιον is used in reference to a Pentateuchal narrative in Philo, Pot. 1.48; Migr.Migr. 1.27, 85, 166, 168. This use still seems connected, in Philo, to his view that the scriptures were revealed to Moses by prophecy (see Post. 1.28; Gig. 1.49, 63; Deus 1.50). 89) This use of λόγια continues in late-first and early-second century C.E. Christian writ ers. See Clement, 1 Cor. 13:4; 19:1; 53:1 (= τάς ιεράς γράφας); Ignatius, Ep. 3, 9:3; Ep. 7, 3:5. In Polycarp, Phil. 7:1 λόγια is even used for the text of a Gospel writing.</page><page sequence="27">I. W. Scott / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 1-28 Ύ1 Such an understanding of the law's nature in Aristeas also helps to resolve a puzzling moment in Eleazar's explanation ofTorah. In 158 the high priest tells us that Moses "also commanded us to fasten the sayings (τά λόγια) upon our posts and doors so that we would remember God." Although the function of this command (along with the law as a whole) is to maintain Israel's focus on the Deity, these λόγια are conspicuously not not said to be God's "sayings." On the contrary, assuming that the audi ence knows the regulations dealing with mezuzot, they will understand that it is excerpts of the Pentateuch to which λόγια here refers, the same laws which Eleazar has clearly said were a product of Moses' intelligence. Yet the writer of Aristeas would also know that the plural term would bring with it overtones of divine revelation. It may be, then, that this ambiguity is precisely what the author intends to produce. The law does encode the "sayings" of God himself, but it does so because Moses' ratio nal intellect penetrated even God's own sphere. The commands are at once God's λόγια and Moses' own. This same understanding ofTorah seems to surface in paragraph 240, during the king's extended symposium. Here one of the Jewish translators tells Ptolemy that "God gave the insights to those who framed the laws (τάς έπινοίας ό θεός εδωκε τοις νομοθετησασι) in order to preserve human lives." Initially we might find here an explicit statement of the Jewish law's inspiration by God. What may easily be overlooked, however, is that the translator is not talking specifically about Moses or Torah. The substan tive participle τοις νομοθετησασι, "those who framed the laws," is plural. The translator must, then, be making a more general statement about those who have framed various legal codes. What is more, this affirmation of God's involvement comes in response to Ptolemy's question: "How can I avoid doing anything against the law (μηθέν παράνομον πράσσοι)?" (240). There is no indication anywhere in Aristeas that Ptolemy (or any of the other Alexandrian Hellenists for that matter) intends to adopt Israel's law. The king's question, then, seems to be a general one concerning a life lived within any good legislative system. Taken together, these two obser vations seem to demand that the Jewish translator is claiming some sort of divine origin for all legal codes, or at least the systems of the great Hel lenistic lawgivers like Solon and Lycurgus. The Jewish translator thus seems to make the astonishing concession that God has aided all wise legislators. At the same time, we must remember that those Greek codes of law were not generally understood as products of direct or prophetic revelation. Since the responses of the Jewish banqueters are generally geared to reflect popular Hellenistic moral and political philosophy,</page><page sequence="28">28 I. W. Scott /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 1-28 we would not expect a departure here from that usual opinion that the Hellenic legal codes were human achievements. The implication seems to be, again, that God "gives" laws to humanity, not by supernatural revela tion, but less directly through the insights of great minds. It would seem that the writer of Aristeas extends to Greek legislation in general the kind of of relationship with God that he affirms more clearly for the Mosaic code. Such laws are gifts from God. They find their origin in God's providential care for humanity. Yet this providence does not interrupt natural human activity. Rather, God grants to certain great men the kind of intellectual brilliance that will allow them to perceive the moral order of things and frame laws that foster the flourishing of human societies.90 Conclusions: The Law as Revelation and Human Artefact We find in the Book of Aristeas an understanding of divine revelation in scriptural texts that is radically different from the notion of "inspiration" we usually expect from Jewish writers in the Second Temple period. The Pentateuch is not, for the author of Aristeas, delivered to Moses through prophetic oracles. Even the revelatory event on Mount Sinai seems to be treated as a figure or metaphor. Instead, the law is depicted as a purely human artefact, the product of Moses' reasoned insight into the moral and political workings of the cosmos. Likewise the Greek translation of the Torah, which the writer of Aristeas presents as authoritative in its own right, is the fruit of diligent scholarship, not mantic possession. At the same time, this Alexandrian author does not seem to give up the claim that Torah finds its origin in God. Not only does God act providentially to grant Moses his awe-inspiring rational powers, but Moses' reason itself seems, as in Stoic thought, to bring Israel's legislator in contact with the divine mind. Hence the law's commands are at once the "sayings of God" and the words of Moses. Rather than pitting revelation and reason against one another, the writer of Aristeas appears to elevate human intellect at its best as the medium through which God s revelation comes into the world. 901 Note that Shutt s English translation also has Eleazar refer to the "ordinances of God" in 160, but the Greek expression (τάς τοΰ θεοΰ καχασκευάς) clearly refers to God's provi dential arrangements in creation.</page></plain_text>
