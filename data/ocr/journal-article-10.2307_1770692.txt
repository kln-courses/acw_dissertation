Since Bridges wrote this in 1895, the pictorial in Keats has been described and explored in a hundred different ways. His famous sensuousness ("O for a Life of sensations rather than of Thoughts") has been cele- brated ad nauseam, though also, less frequently, balanced against his respect for thought, combining with it into what he described as "a complex Mind-one that is imaginative and at the same time careful of its fruits."2 Less has been done with the "objectiv" aspect. Critics have been more interested in what Keats added on to perception-to use Bridges' distinction-than in his perception itself. Perhaps his Ro- mantic qualities-his pleasant-painful indolence, sex-death syndrome, paradox of "to feel for ever"-have attracted attention to the exclusion of what is non-Romantic and, when seen retroactively, modernistic. Not that his quarrel with Wordsworthian "egotism" has been ig- nored. Nobody who reads his letters can do so. "Negative capability," as extinction of self for the sake of total empathy with subject, has been not only praised but worked out of all proportion, certainly out of the ten lines it occupies in the famous letter to his brothers, or even the thirty lines about the "camelion Poet" in the equally famous letter to Woodhouse.3 But even this idea has been related to Shakespeare, to Shelley's ethics of self-transcendence, to Wordsworth's "wise passive- 1"Critical Introduction to Keats," in Collected Essays Papers etc. of Robert Bridges (London, 1927), I, 91. 2 Letter to Benjamin Bailey, Nov. 22, 1817, in The Letters of John Keats, ed.

Little has been done to show how this wish to face the object of perception objectively and without self-projection is a depar- ture from Romanticism, the beginning of a basically modernistic tradi- tion of objectivity, foreshadowing the Imagists. This can be realized only if we insist on our own twentieth-century vantage point and let our understanding of the past-to quote Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent"-"be altered by the present." Like Borges, who found Kafka in Browning or Leon Bloy, one can find in Keats Pound, Rilke, and John Ashbery. A knowledge of these poets, whose "objectivism" is much more advanced and central, may draw one's attention to certain beginnings in Keats, half-realized and perhaps off center, but definitely foreshadowing much that is in the very essence of modern poetry. A less anachronistic approach to Keats may miss them. I shall turn first to Pound, for he is related to Keats's thoughts about poetry rather than to the poetry itself. When Keats contrasts his own "deep and sentimental" "Endymion" to "Hyperion," "more naked and grecian" in manner,4 one cannot but relate this equation of non- sentimental = non-deep = naked = Greek to Pound's early Imagist pro- nouncements : to his ideal of "direct treatment of the thing," "nearer the bone," "no superfluous word," "free from emotional slither"5-and to its association with Hellenism: "Objective-no slither; direct-no ex- cessive use of adjectives, no metaphors that won't permit examination. It's straight talk, straight as the Greek!"' Of course, Keats, unlike Pound, does not really dismiss the "deep and sentimental" for the "naked and grecian." Like Ruskin, who contrasted the "Pathetic Fal- lacy" to Homer's objectivity but loved the "pathetic" aspect of it,7 Keats distinguishes the two modes rather than preferring one over the other. Besides, his "naked and grecian" is the "direct treatment," not of the "thing" but of the heroic and titanic myth, which he believes calls for a harder, more Miltonic texture than the soft romance of "Endym- ion." And yet Keats's "nakedness" does relate to Imagist ideas; in another letter he recommends the naked thing-undeclared and unin- terpreted : Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.-How beautiful are 4 Letter to Benjamin Haydon, Jan. 23, 1818, Letters, I, 207. 5 Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, ed.

I believe that the proper and perfect symbol is the natural object, that if a man use "symbols" he must so use them that their symbolic function does not obtrude; so that a sense, and the poetic quality of the passage, is not lost to those who do not understand the symbol as such, to whom, for instance, a hawk is a hawk. (Pound, pp. 6, 9) That is why Pound objects to an expression such as "dim lands of peace": "It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer's not realizing that the natural object is always the adequate symbol" (Pound, p. 5). His advice not to use such expres- sions seems to duplicate Keats's advice to John Hamilton Reynolds in another part of the February 3 letter. Reynolds had sent him two son- nets on Robin Hood.1o Keats likes the concrete simplicity of the first sonnet's opening line, "The trees in Sherwood forest are old and good": "Where there are a throng of delightful Images ready drawn," he writes to Reynolds, "simplicity is the only thing." He is definitely less happy with a line from the second sonnet, "His green-wood beauty sits, tender and true." "Tender and true," he tells Reynolds, is "the only word or two I find fault with, the more because I have had so much reason to shun it as a quicksand." "We must cut this," he continues, "and not be rattlesnaked into any more of the like" (Letters, I, 223). Like Pound, Keats too seems to feel that one should "go in fear of abstractions." "Tender and true," a type of expression he had "so much reason" to resist-perhaps because he was strongly attracted to it yet aware of its ineffectiveness-is the equivalent of Pound's "peace" in "dim lands of peace." Both expressions come "from the writer's not realizing that the natural object is the adequate symbol." Both must be "cut." Rarely in the poems, less rarely in the letters, does Keats in fact present natural objects "uncontaminated."

K. Wimsatt has described and related to the general romantic way of "[reading] meanings into the landscape."" It is a structure in which "both tenor and vehicle . . are wrought in a parallel process out of the same material." It makes the objects of nature constantly hover between the literal and the figurative, between their independent thereness as "the occasion of reminiscence" and their subordination to ego as "the source of the metaphors by which reminis- cence is described." Keats's "To Autumn" is, indeed, one of the poems Wimsatt uses to illustrate his point. Similarly, an image from "Endym- ion" had been quoted by Ruskin to show how the "Pathetic Fallacy" of the "moderns" differed from Homer's objective mode. If Keats speaks of the "wayward indolence" with which the foam rolls down the wave, Homer, says Ruskin, "could not by any possibility have lost sight of the great fact that the wave, from the beginning to the end of it, do what it might, was still nothing else than salt water; and that salt water could not be either wayward or indolent."12 Keats, that is, did lose sight of the "great fact" that nature is extra- human. Certainly his earlier poetry shows Wimsatt's "structure of ro- mantic nature imagery" to perfection. In particular, "I stood tip-toe upon a little hill" (December 1816) is a shining example of Wimsatt's formula. The sweetpeas which the poet sees stand tip-toe like himself (lines 1, 57) and, more generally, nature throughout shows a movement of interweaving ("about them," "oversweep them," "let ... round," "bind," "overtwined") which runs parallel to the intermingling of the beholder's eye with it ("peer about," "skim round," "trace," "picture out," "hover over").13 The sweetpeas, with their "taper fingers catch- ing at all things / To bind them all about with tiny rings," are both themselves and a metaphor for the eye catching at them. The streamlet's water coming "round that bend" is also the eye tracing the path's bend "To picture out the quaint and curious bending / Of a fresh woodland alley." And the "leap / Of buds into ripe flowers" is also the leap of the mind "ever startled" by it. Nature's movements then become one with the movement of the mind's best product, poetry: In the calm grandeur of a sober line We see the waving of the mountain pine; And when a tale is beautifully stayed, We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade. The following mythical section (lines 141-204) is a logical upshot of 11 W. K. Wimsatt, Jr., The Verbal Icon (Lexington, Ky., 1954), p. 110. 12 Ruskin, III, 178-79. 13 The Poems of John Keats, ed.

The human mind which reads itself into nature populates it with the human -though also other than human-myths of Psyche, Syrinx, and the rest. Two and a half years later, however, Keats depopulates nature from the very same myth. In "Ode to Psyche" (April 1819), Psyche, part (though "loveliest") of "Olympus' faded hierarchy," must disappear from forest, air, water, and fire, which are no longer "holy." In "I stood tip-toe," nature had been made the habitat of this girl-in-love as a projection of the mythmaker's own love; nature, like the moon in a line Keats deleted from the poem, was "Smiler on Lovers when they smile on thee.1"14 Now, the times being "so far retired / From happy pieties," the poet's private inspiration ("by my own eyes inspired") must build Psyche a temple "In some untrodden region of my mind," must recreate for himself "Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe." There is "No voice, no lute, no pipe" out there. The landscape, in other words, is no longer "haunted" by Psyche's- the Soul's-presence. It no longer hovers between the literal and figura- tive, no longer shows Wimsatt's imaginative structure. Instead, it is wholly transplanted into the mind, which now contains "branched thoughts," "trellis of brain," even a "casement ope at night." But aren't those mental branches or trellis as metaphorical as the intertwining grass and violets and moss in "I stood tip-toe" ? They are, but with a difference. It is one thing to think of external reality in terms of the mind, another to think of the mind in terms of external reality; one thing to impose mind on things, another to impose things on mind. Keats now takes the latter direction: instead of external objects being lent the abstractness of mind, mind is now lent the concreteness of external objects. The philosophy behind this is not Coleridge's "sweet and indissoluble union between the intellectual and the material world."15 It is rather the substitution of the intellectual for the material world. Graham Hough describes it as "a recognition by Keats that his own exploration is to be of the interior landscape, that his ultimate devotion is to be neither to the objective world nor to any power outside himself.""1 Exactly. But the point I am making is that the withdrawal from the objective to the interior leads, paradoxically, to an objectification of the interior. The poet is bestowing on the mind the hard edges of a 14 Allott, p. 91, line 122n; my italics. 15 Wimsatt, p. 107. 16 The Romantic Poets (London, 1953), p. 173. 47</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE world lost to it. It is now branched, has trellis and casement. Similarly, in "To Sleep," a sonnet written in the same month, the soul is a casket with key and oiled wards: "Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards, / And seal the hushed casket of my soul." Rilke is a master in this art of materializing the mind. It is therefore natural that we should find some striking parallels between him and Keats. More consistently than Rilke, who can speak of the poet also in pseudo-Platonic, active terms as the "bee of the invisible," collecting "the honey of the visible to accumulate it in the great golden hive of the Invisible,"" Keats disdains this metaphor: "Let us not therefore go hurrying about and collecting honey-bee like, buzzing here and there impatiently from a knowledge of what is to be arrived at."'s On the other hand, Keats's ideal, like Rilke's elsewhere, is the opposite part of the same image, the passively receptive flower: "But let us open our leaves like a flower and be passive and receptive"-which is directly echoed as it were in Rilke's sonnet about the anemone, emblem of "end- less reception": "Aber wann, in welchem aller Leben, / sind wir endlich offen und Empfiinger ?"19 Receptivity, in both poets, spells imperson- ality and total empathy with their subject. It is fascinating to find both choosing the same neutrally physical object, a ball, in order to test their negative capability. This is what Rilke, pointing to a tree, told a friend: "You see, that is what I want to do and nothing else: I would like to say this tree so that only the tree would speak in my words, exactly as it is, without any addition of my own. In my poem The Ball I succeeded in doing that; there I expressed nothing except the almost inexpressible phenomenon of a pure movement. That is why it is my best poem."20 Unlike Rilke, Keats did not write a poem about a ball. But he did use the example of a ball and its movement to make the same point to a friend, Richard Woodhouse. "He has affirmed," Woodhouse writes to John Taylor, "that he can conceive of a billiard Ball that it may have a sense of delight from its own roundness, smoothness, volubility &amp; the rapidity of its motion."21 Woodhouse relates this in enthusiastic con- firmation of Keats's self-description as a "camelion poet," "able to throw his own soul into any object he sees or imagines, so as to see feel be sensible of &amp; express, all that the object itself would see feel be sen- sible of or express-&amp; he will speak out of that object-so that his own 17 Rainer Maria Rilke, letter to Witold Hulewicz, Nov. 13, 1925, as translated in Eudo C.

" It is, of course, significant that Keats said what he did about the ball but did not write a poem about one.22 The significance becomes clear when one compares two sonnets on something that both Keats and Rilke did write about, the color blue: Keats's "Blue! 'Tis the life of heaven" and Rilke's "Blaue Hortensie." It is not only that blue is a weightier subject than the ball, being the color of sky, ocean, violet and, above all, eyes, and hence respectable enough for poetry. Keats also subordinates it a priori to a human interest by presenting it as an answer to a sonnet by Reynolds, the end of which he quotes : "Dark eyes are dearer far / Than those that mock the hyacinthine bell." The subordination to the human, as well as the generality of the color in the poem ("the life of waters ... pools numberless . .. all the sweetest flowers"), contrasts with Rilke's manifest intention to achieve, as Kdite Hamburger shows,23 a "phe- nomenological reduction" of a very particular blue-that of hydrangeas, and to do so by subordinating all human metaphors (letter paper, child's apron) to the purely physical phenomenon. This contrast, as well as the fact that Keats did not write a poem about a ball, shows the limits of our Keats-Rilke comparison. But it does not invalidate it. Despite the difference between their ideas of the end of poetry, one cannot fail to see the affinity in sensibility between Keats's statement that "when I was a Schoolboy I thought a fair Woman a pure Goddess, my mind was a soft nest in which some one of them slept though she knew it not"24 and another Rilke sonnet: "Und fast ein Miidchen wars ... / und machte sich ein Bett in meinem Ohr."25 We are back to the materialization of the mind referred to earlier. The annihilation of the self for the sake of complete empathy with the object has for its obverse side the expression of self in terms of the object. It is as if the annihilated self has nothing with which to express itself now except the object it has empathized with. The mind has become forest, casket, ball, soft nest, and bed for a sleeping beauty. We have seen this process in the "Ode to Psyche." Without suggest- ing one more common denominator for the great odes-an enterprise which has attracted many critics and angered others-I should like to propose that three more of Keats's odes center on the I-object relation, and that two out of the three show a conception of this relation which a poem by John Ashbery helps to make clear. I refer to "Ode to a 22 He did mention a ball in a letter to Fanny Brawne, July 5, 1820: "I will resent my heart having been made a football" (Letters, II, 303-04). 23 "Die phiinomenologische Struktur der Dichtung Rilkes," in Rilke in neuer Sicht, ed.

Sept. 19, 1819). The nightingale, like the billiard ball, is an object for empathetic encounter. That a bird was for Keats a natural object for such encounter is shown in a line from a letter to Bailey: "If a Sparrow come before my Window I take part in its exist [e]nce and pick about the Gravel."26 The bird, like the ball, is an object whose identity, as he puts it, "press [es] upon me that, I am in a very little time an[ni]hilated."27 "Ode to a Nightingale" certainly contains much more than that. It has been shown to trace "the inception, nature, and decline of the creative mood," and express "Keats' attempt to understand his feelings about the contrast between the ideal and actual and the close association of pain with pleasure."28 On a simpler level, however, it is the re-creation of a total confrontation with an object: the happy annihilation of self needed for such a confrontation and the way it disappears with the disappearance of the object. As acoustic object ("The voice I hear," "Thy plaintive anthem") the nightingale's song is all dynamic effect, as it were. It does not show the tension between static object and dynamic effect which marks visual objects. This tension I find central to the "Grecian Urn" and "Autumn" odes. That is why they are more interesting as object poems. The interest of the "Nightingale" ode-though it is basically a record of object-perception-lies mainly elsewhere. It was while reading a poem written 150 years later, John Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,"29 that I realized how central the object-effect dualism is to "Urn" and to "Autumn." This anachronism becomes perhaps less outrageous when one discovers that Ashbery regards the theme of "an individual consciousness confronting or con- fronted by a world of external phenomena" as his only theme.30 "Self- Portrait" is a long and difficult poem about a haunting masterpiece by the sixteenth-century Italian painter Parmigianino. What is peculiar to this painting is the startling distortion owing to the mirror's shape, reproduced by a tondo panel on which the portrait is painted. Most striking is the disproportion between hand and head. The art historian Sidney Freedberg (other lines from whose discussion of this painting are quoted in the poem itself) says about the hand: "The hand, distort- edly large as it would in fact appear in such a mirror, looms in the very 26 Nov. 22, 1817, Letters, I, 186. 27 Letter to Woodhouse, Oct. 27, 1818, Letters, I, 387. 28 Allott, in Poems, p. 524n. 29 Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror (New York, 1975), pp. 68-83. 3so Quoted in Contemporary Poets, ed.

What catches Ashbery's imagination is the symbolic potentialities of the hand that is both thrust out and swerving away. It becomes an emblem for the work of art-or any object, for that matter-which is itself closed, static, and at the same time a dynamic agent affecting the beholder. This paradox is a leitmotif, if not of the entire poem, at least of its first section, where it appears and reappears in a striking number of variations: the face, which swims And still return safely to its nest? .. Longing to be free, outside, but it must stay Posing in this place ... Toward and away like the hand... Lively and intact in a recurring wave Of arrival... But how far can it swim out through the eyes so powerful In its restraint... makes the hand loom large As it retreats slightly... You will stay on, restive, serene in Your gesture which is neither embrace nor warning But which holds something of both in pure Affirmation that doesn't affirm anything. And, most brilliantly, in a strange image: "a ping-pong ball / Secure on its jet of water." The jet of water, like the previous "recurring wave of arrival," is the dynamism of the effect that reaches you. But the work of art itself remains there, stationary like the ping-pong ball, securely suspended over the abyss of movement, of endlessly changing effect and meaningfulness. Change, thus, is in the very essence of the work of art: its "security," its thereness, rests on the ever renewing response to it. In this sense, its very shape is revealed in change, i.e., in its own destruc- tion. This is wonderfully rendered in another water image: "Like a wave breaking on a rock, giving up / Its shape in a gesture which ex- 31 Sidney L. Freedberg, Parmigianino: His Works in Painting (Westport, Conn., 1971), p. 105. 51</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE presses that shape." The Keatsian element here is evident. Much has been written on the psychology of Keats's equation of intensity and ,death, or, to use Ashbery's terms, expressing shape by giving up shape. "'To Autumn," of course, is a good case in point. What I find more interesting, however, is a more latent element in Keats, which Ashbery's poem helps to actualize: the dualism of static object and dynamic effect, so central to "Self-Portrait," seems no less central, though less explicit, to "Urn" and, more surprisingly, to "Autumn" as well. Like Ashbery's poem, both odes are ekphrastic: the "Grecian Urn" manifestly so, "To Autumn" when we look at the letter to Reynolds in which Keats refers to the poem's composition: "How beautiful the season is now-How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it. Really, without joking, chaste weather-Dian Skies-I never lik'd stub- ble fields so much as now-Aye better than the chilly green of the spring. Somehow a stubble plain looks warm--in the same way that some pictures look warm-this struck me so much in my sunday's walk that I composed upon it."32 The underlying experience is of a picture that looks warm: i.e., a visual object which is objectively there and at the same time affects you, subjectively, as warmth. The contrast, in the letter, between this autumn warmth and the "chilly green of the spring" has for its equivalent in the poem a contrast between autumn's "music" and the "songs of spring." Sound, in other words, stands, like warmth, for the object's effect on you, and it is elaborated in the third stanza, where its simultaneity with the visual element, i.e., the object itself, is stressed through syntax: thou hast thy music too- While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day, And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue. Then in a wailful choir ... (my italics) The resemblance between some of the sound-words used in this stanza and some of those in "Urn"33 reminds us that a contrast between two sorts of music is also central to the latter poem: "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard / Are sweeter." The above equation of sound with effect shows that this line, too, refers to the paradox of static object and dynamic effect: a heard melody, like the nightingale's, is identical with the object itself and therefore unproblematic. The real mystery is that of the melody of the silent form. Like the picture that looks warm, the urn that sings and pipes is a mysterious interaction of object and 32 Sept. 21, 1819, Letters, II, 167; my italics. 3i "Songs," "sing," "music," "Whistles," and "twitter in the skies" in "Autumn"; "song," "Songs," "melodies," "melodist," "pipes," "piping," and "lowing at the skies" in "Urn." 52</page><page sequence="11">KEATS, POUND, RILKE, ASHBERY effect. Hence the unanswerable question, "What pipes and timbrels ?" Hence also the much-discussed line, "Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought," which I take to mean: the static form of art, silent in itself, has the inexplicable power of shaking us, perhaps of demanding, like Rilke's Archaic Torso of Apollo, that we change our lives.34 That "Urn" is, thus, a poem about the paradox of expressive form is clear enough. The paradox is stated too frequently in the poem to be missed. What has not been noticed, it seems, is that the same paradox is central to "Autumn." Critics have dwelt on the impersonal objectivity of the later poem, on their feeling that "Keats in this poem is almost content with the pure phenomenon."35 As such, it has been contrasted to the earlier spring odes. But if I am right in claiming that "To Autumn," too, is ekphrastic and that it also deals with the paradox of expressive form, the poem becomes strongly related to the "Urn" and more than "content with the pure phenomenon." Autumn, of course, is a season, not a picture. But Keats, as we saw from his letter to Reynolds, was thinking of the stubble plains in terms of a picture, and the picture-like quality of the four personifications of autumn in the second stanza is so obvious that they have been related to actual paintings by Poussin, Giulio Romano, and others.36 All four are marked by what W. J. Bate has called "dynamic poise,"37 an ar- rested movement which recalls that of the figures on the urn38 or that of pseudo-Cortez' men at the end of "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer." The problematic split in technique between this painterly stanza and the first and third stanzas can be accounted for if we apply the "dynamic poise" element to the entire poem, as its overall structural principle. The tactile energy of the first stanza ("to load ... to bend . . ." etc.) and the softer auditory movement of the third are related to the visual and static quality of the second in the same way as this static quality itself is related to the movement arrested in it. In other words, the entire poem, not only the second stanza, is about the mysterious way in which a static object (stanza 2) produces a dynamic effect (warmth in stanza 1, sound in stanza 3). Autumn, to paraphrase Ashbery, is both 34 Rilke's "Archaischer Torso Apollos" (Gedichte, p. 557) is another ekphras- tic poem which centers on the paradox of object (the stone itself, "entstellt und kurz") and effect (glittering like an animal's fur, transcending itself like a star). 35 Kenneth Muir, "The Meaning of the Odes," rpt. in John Keats: Odes.
