This article investigates several leading world historical periodization models, as well as the problematic translation of those models into content standards and standardized tests, in order to explore the problems and possibilities of how to place Greco-Roman history into world historical context in both teaching and scholarly publication. I. You Expect Me to Teach What? The State of the Problem Historians of Greece and Rome, and the classics in general, have come under fire for a lack of world historical perspective. Andre Gun der Frank and Barry K. Gills, for instance, have essentially compared the Eurocentrism of classicists to a disease in need of a cure. Frank and Gills argue that their own perspective on world history, which looks at the last 5000 years as a world system, "offers a powerful antidote to the Eurocentric classical historians, who imposed their bias upon studies of the ancient world by privileging the role of Greco Roman civilization in the story of world history . . . systematically denigrat[ing] and dismissing] as unimportant" what non-western or "oriental" societies contributed.2 Whether or not classicists suffer from the disease of Eurocentrism, they certainly have had less investment than Africanists or Sinologists in promoting, or even adopting, the world historical agenda. Why is that? One answer is that while western civilization mod els thrived, classicists were already at the center and in fact stood to lose ground as the "west is best" or "west and the rest" models were cast off, and more global models for teaching and doing history were adopted from primary levels of education on up through colle giate departments.3 Another answer is grounded in classical training. 1 These ideas were presented in nascent form as part of the roundtable discus sion "Ancient History and/as World History," at the May 2006 Annual Meeting of the Association of Ancient Historians at Stanford University. I would like to thank the organizers, Ian Morris and Walter Scheidel, for arranging the roundtable and the participants at the conference for their feedback on earlier stages of these ideas. Many thanks are also due to Ross Dunn and David Christian, my colleagues at San Diego State University who first introduced me to World (and "Big") History paradigms, and to the anonymous reviewers at Classical World for their valuable insights. 2 A. G. Frank and B. K. Gills, The World System: Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand? (New York 1993) 21. They argue that a world system approach that exam ines how "all the major zones of ancient Eurasia" participated in "a common economic process" will correct the problems of Eurocentrism. 3 Erich Gruen addressed some of these same issues with respect to the challenges that multiculturalism posed to classics in his 1992 Presidential Address to the APA, "Cultural Fictions and Cultural Identity," TAPA 123 (1993) 1-14. 53</page><page sequence="2">54 CLASSICAL WORLD Traditionally trained Hellenists and Romanists can be expected to be skilled philologists and to work with a range of other evidence-types from papyri and coins to statuary and inscriptions, all necessitating an interdisciplinary approach. In recent decades, particularly in the United States, empirical models ceded some ground to theoretical models for re-mining the sources, and so if one were lucky, one was trained in comparative approaches for constructing and interpreting history.4 Many historians of Greece and Rome, however, are trained in classics departments and not in the history departments where they would learn the ins and outs of historiography after Ammianus Marcel linus or Procopius. Perhaps, then, Greco-Roman historians should be forgiven for not jumping immediately into the world historical fray, even if ornithologists like Jared Diamond are popularizing the field in Pulitzer-Prize-winning books and PBS miniseries.5 The time for standing outside the world-history debate, however, both from a pedagogical and from a scholarly standpoint, has passed. Historians of Greece and Rome, by not fully engaging the broader issues of world history and its construction, are letting others do this construction for us, with misleading and disastrous results. By not actively participating in the world historical dialogue, historians of Greece and Rome are allowing world historians to use our people and our issues "to think out" agendas that are not central to our insider's view of the relevance of Greece and Rome. An examination of world historical periodization models, state content standards, and assessment instruments demonstrates the need for historians of Greece and Rome to get more involved in world historical teaching and scholarship so that world history is not simply done to us, but rather by us, with the unique perspective our field can offer. Historians of Greece and Rome need to take a much more active role in shaping and contributing to world history, instead of becoming victims of a shifting paradigm. II. Greco-Roman History and World History Periodizing Classicists and historians of Greece and Rome value our own long-standing models for periodizing history. Whether the traditional Greek chronology from Minoan, to Mycenaean, to "Dark Ages," Ar chaic, Classical, and Hellenistic or the familiar Roman chronology from pre-Roman foundings, to monarchy and Etruscans, the Republic (early, middle, and late), and the Empire (principate and dominate), we work around and through these familiar subdivisions of time. Not that these have been unassailable ways of thinking about time; gender studies, for one, have forced a rethinking of whether or not these are the most meaningful ways to conceptualize Greco-Roman 4 I. Morris and J. G. Manning note some of these same issues in the introduction to the collected essays in The Ancient Economy (Stanford 2005). 5 J. Diamond, Guns, Germs and Steel (New York 1997); and Collapse (New York 2004).</page><page sequence="3">PAEDAGOGUS 55 antiquity.6 But the models do constitute a largely agreed-upon starting point and range of core issues within which to frame any discus sion. World history, however, folds Greece and Rome into much larger scales of time and place?scales that look for unifying factors and themes different from those central to historians of Greece and Rome.7 World history destabilizes Greece and Rome as the center of a Mediterranean system, and instead transforms them into peripheral entities at the far western end of a vast network of exchange reaching as far to the east as China, with Mesopotamian and the Indus River civilizations serving as central nodes, and pastoral herdsmen, such as the Scythians, as vital glue binding the whole system together. In short, Greece and Rome are peripheral to the larger system that world historians have called Indo-Mediterranea, the Eurasian oecumene, or even the Old World Web.8 The decentering of Greece and Rome by world history is not merely a geographical shift. The change in emphasis is also tempo ral and thematic. The various models for periodizing world history make this change in emphasis abundantly clear. In one model, David Christian's Big History, Greece and Rome fall into his "Era IV, The Holocene Era of Human History (the last 10,000 Years)" up to 1500 C.E.9 In this 10,000-year chunk of time, Christian highlights develop ments such as "first cities, states and agrarian civilizations; powerful elites controlling] resources through tribute-taking; organized warfare, large-scale worship, monument building; writing; agrarian civilizations spread and become the most populous and powerful of human communities."10 6 For a rethinking of some of these models, see Inventing Ancient Culture: Histori cism, Periodization, and the Ancient World, eds. M. Golden and P. Toohey (New York 1997). For feminist challenges to these models, see J. Zinsser, Women and History: Glass Half Full (New York 1993); and P. Culham, "Did Women Have an Empire," in Golden and Toohey (above). 7 See the articles by P. Stearns, J. Bentley, and W. Green in R. Dunn, ed., New World History (New York 2000) 364-93, for some general thoughts on periodizing world history. 8 The term Indo-Mediterranea was coined by Marshall Hodgson. For an overview of Hodgson's ideas about world history as they developed from the 1940s through the 1960s, see his collected essays in Rethinking World History, ed. Edmund Burke, III (Cambridge 1993). Eurasian oecumene and "Old World Web" are terms used by W. H. McNeill (with J. R. McNeill, The Human Web: A Birds-Eye View of World History [New York 2003] 41). 9 D. Christian, Maps of Time (Berkeley 2004). The full list of eras in Big History includes: Era I, History of the Universe before Our Sun (13 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years ago); Era II, History of Earth and Life on Earth (from 4.5 billion years ago); Era III, Paleolithic Era of Human History (from 5 million to 10,000 years ago); Era IV, The Holocene Era of Human History (the last 10,000 years); and Era V, The Modern Era (the last 500 years). 10 D. Christian (above, n.9) Appendix I: "Dating Techniques and Timelines."</page><page sequence="4">56 Classical World It is hard to recognize the specificity and particularity of Greek and Roman civilizations within so large a scope. River-valley civili zations occur in almost the same breath as the major empires of the classical period, both of which are important for what they suggest about human communities writ large and not for the features unique to their development. The distinctions between, and development over time of, Mycenaean, Archaic, and Hellenistic Greece, for instance, are irrelevant when the unifying theme over 10,000 years is the expansion and subsequent interconnectedness of human societies as a whole. The model proffered by AP Central, which is an influential model given the increasing importance of such testing, places Greece and Rome into its first period, called "Foundations: c. 8000 B.C.E. to 600 C.E."11 AP Central recommends spending about 20 percent of one's teaching time on this first of five units, spanning almost 9000 years of human history and encompassing major developments as diverse as: fundamental concepts about what history is; the development of agriculture; and the development of early civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, the Shang Dynasty in China, Mesoamerica, and Andean South America. When classical civilizations do take center stage in the AP model, political developments in China, India, and the Mediterranean are given equal weight. Other emphases in studying the classical civilizations include their social, gender, and cultural struc tures, "major trading patterns within and among" them, their major belief systems, and features of the late classical period, including the collapse of empires and continued interregional networks.12 The time range in the AP model, 9000 years, is not much shorter than that offered by "Big History," although it is a different 9000-year span that ends in 600, rather than 1500, C.E. While there is more room for detail on Greece and Rome, that detail comes in the context of the contemporary empires elsewhere and is often only significant as far as it allows parallels to be drawn between the empires. World History for Us All and the National Center for History in the Schools offer fairly similar models to one another, at least as far as Greece and Rome are concerned. The World History for Us All model situates Greece and Rome within its Big Era Four: Expand ing Networks of Exchange and Encounter (1200 B.C.E.-500 C.E.).13 11 The AP Central model http://apcentral.collegeboard.com includes Foundations: c. 8000 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.; 600-1450 C.E.; 1450-1750 C.E.; and 1750-1914 C.E.; 1914-present. 12 For the full model and details, see World History Course Description (2005) 12-13, at http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/repository/05821apcoursdescworld_4332.pdf. 13 World History for Us All (R. Dunn, et al., http://worldhistoryforusall.sdsu.edu) periodizes world history into: Big Era One, Humans in the Universe (13,000,000,000-200,000 years ago); Big Era Two, Human Beings Almost Everywhere (200,000-10,000 years ago); Big Era Three, Farming and the Emergence of Complex Societies (10,000-1000 B.C.E.); Big Era Four, Expanding Networks of Exchange and Encounter (1200 B.C.E.-500 C.E.); Big Era Five, Patterns of Interregional Unity (300-1500 C.E.); Big Era Six, The Great Global Convergence (1400-1800 C.E.); Big Era Seven, Industrialization and its Consequences (1750-1914 C.E.); Big Era Eight, A Half Century of Crisis (1900-1950 C.E.); and Big Era Nine, Paradoxes of Global Acceleration (1945-present C.E.).</page><page sequence="5">PAEDAGOGUS 57 Themes stressed in this model include interregional systems of com munication, technology, population growth, urban development, and the formation of various empires (e.g., Han, Achaemenid Persian, and Roman), and social structures and belief systems within those empires. Suggested teaching units relevant to Greco-Roman history focus on Indomediterranean trade from 1200 to 600 B.C.E., Greco Persian relations from 600 to 300 B.C.E., and Afroeurasian empires from 300 B.C.E. to 200 C.E.; but there are also several units having little to do with Greco-Roman history, on societies and developments in East Asia, Africa south of the Sahara, the Americas, and the tropical seas.14 The National Center for History in the Schools locates Greece and Rome in its "Era 3: Classical Traditions, Major Religions, and Giant Empires, 1000 B.C.E.-300 C.E."15 While this is a slightly nar rower time frame, the issues discussed are largely similar: definition of classical civilizations, emergence of major world religions, and appearance of giant empires.16 The model governing Traditions and Encounters, a popular col legiate world history textbook, puts Greece and Rome in the period of Classical Societies (500 B.C.E.-500 C.E.).17 Persia, China, India, and the Mediterranean basin take center stage in this period. The Traditions and Encounters paradigm stresses the development and maintenance of vast imperial states, the internal and external military challenges faced by these states, the long-distance trade that linked these regions, and the cultural and religious traditions that developed in each region and spread from one to the other.18 Given its timescale, themes, and even its designation as "classical," this classical civilization model is the one most comfortable for historians of Greece and Rome and indeed the most productive, from a Hellenist's or Romanist's perspective, 14 See "Big Era Four" at World History for Us All, http://worldhistoryforusall. sdsu.edu/dev/eras/era4.htm. 15 National Center for History in the Schools (http://nchs.ucla.edu/standards) suggests: Era 1, The Beginnings of Human History; Era 2, Early Civilizations and the Emergence of Pastoral Peoples, 4000-1000 B.C.E.; Era 3, Classical Traditions, Major Religions, and Giant Empires, 1000 B.C.E.-300 C.E.; Era 4, Expanding Zones of Exchange and Encounter, 300-1000 C.E.; Era 5, Intensified Hemispheric Interac tions, 1000-1500 C.E.; Era 6, The Emergence of the First Global Age, 1450-1770 C.E.; Era 7, Age of Revolutions, 1750-1914 C.E.; Era 8, Half-Century of Crisis and Achievement, 1900-1945 C.E.; and Era 9, The Twentieth Century since 1945: Promises and Paradoxes. 16 For a discussion of Era 3 and its major themes, see R. Dunn and D. Vigilante, eds., Bring History Alive! A Sourcebook for Teaching World History (Los Angeles n.d.). 17 J. Bentley and H. Ziegler, Traditions and Encounters, 3rd ed.

The comparative element, nevertheless, still pushes one beyond one's comfort zones. Each model places Greece and Rome at a different point in the development of world history and each model stresses different major themes into which Greece and Rome are then integrated?some of which are familiar to Greek and Roman scholars and central to the scholarship that we do, while others are neither familiar nor cen tral. On the one extreme, Big History puts Greece and Rome into a context where, when seen through such a wide lens, they are barely distinct and recognizable; on the other extreme, in the Traditions and Encounters model, Greece and Rome look more familiar, but are put into an unfamiliar larger context and treated comparatively. Apart from these unfamiliar larger contexts, the varied scales of time suggest an emphasis that might be disturbing to historians of Greece and Rome. In Big History, Greece and Rome are a miniscule component within a 10,000-year era that is the fourth of five eras. In the AP model, Greece and Rome fall within a 9000-year span that is the first of five eras (the others ranging from 2000 to 90 years, each getting 20 percent of the focus). In World History for Us All, they fall in the 1700-yearlong fourth of nine eras (with subsequent eras of decreasing length from 1200 to 60 years). The National Center for History in the Schools places them in a 1300-yearlong third of nine eras (with subsequent eras ranging from 700 to 60 years in length). The Traditions and Encounters model gives classical civilizations, as a whole, 1000 years (with subsequent eras ranging from 1000 to 60 years in length). The suggestion inherent in all of these models is clear: for many world historians, the farther back into the past one goes, the larger meaningful clumps of time can be and the more historical developments can be aggregated together into larger units. The sad result of this from the perspective of a classical Greek or Roman historian is that the detail on which we focus is lost. This is a standard critique of world history in general.19 What is worse, however, is that when the lens is widened in this way, the scholar ship on Greece and Rome that would support and nuance these new ways of thinking is in short supply. III. State Content Standards for World History A look at the state content standards for teaching world history helps to show the disconnect between the blended world history advo cated by the periodization models just discussed and the way that the teaching of world history is currently implemented in the schools. The 19 For articles addressing the standard concerns about world history, including a loss of specificity, see the various treatments by W. O. Swinton, L. W. Levine, G. Allardyce, L. S. Stavrianos, W. H. McNeill, M. R. Waldman, J. H. Hexter and J. Neus ner in R. Dunn, ed. New World History (New York 2000). World historians recognize that "their explanations of sweeping events or huge processes must be anchored in substantive 'cases' and historical moments. Otherwise, big patterns are nothing more than abstractions" (Dunn, [above] 407).</page><page sequence="7">PAEDAGOGUS 59 first time I encountered these standards was when I began teaching a "World History for Teachers" course that trains future teachers of sixth and seventh graders. Teaching that class, I learned the shocking power these standards wield over young teachers as they design their own curricula. In their application by public-school educators, content standards shape what young people think of as ancient history, which in turn shapes those young people as future college students (choosing classes and seeking a major) and eventually as colleagues, or even as the administrators who ultimately determine whether what historians of Greece and Rome do is valuable enough to be subsidized by our universities, be they public or private institutions.20 These content standards lay out a syllabus that hardly reflects the desirable interconnectedness outlined in the periodization models already discussed, from Big History to Traditions and Encounters. There is some variety in the grade when early world history is taught and the specifics that each state urges teachers to address.21 While the standards may originally have been developed to ensure that indi vidual topics like Greece and Rome were not neglected in the move towards adopting world history, the standards seem to have become either an unintegrated and unachievable checklist or so broad as to be meaningless from the point of view of a historian. A few examples from the state standards illustrate these problems. The California State Standards for teaching history were adopted by the California Board of Education in October 1998.22 Early world history, including Greece and Rome, is taught in grade six. The formal rubric for Greece is "6.4 Students analyze the geographic, political, economic, religious, and social structures of the early civilizations of Ancient Greece." Under this rubric, teachers must cover geography and commerce, the range of Greek governmental forms, specifics about democracy, Greek mythology and literature, the Persian Empire, Athens vs. Sparta and the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars, Alexander the Great, and Greek figures who made contributions to arts and sci ences. The formal rubric for Rome is similar; "6.7 Students analyze the geographic, political, economic, religious, and social structures during the development of Rome." Under this rubric, issues to be addressed include geography and major historical figures, features of Republican government, expansion and trade, empire as a form of government and the role of Julius Caesar and Augustus in creating it, Judaism under Rome, Christian foundings and the spread of Christianity, and the cultural legacy of Rome. This treatment of Greece and Rome 20 D. S. Johnson discusses the emergence and development of world history teaching and offers some thoughts on how to improve it in "World History Educa tion," in M. Hughes-Warrington, ed., Palgrave Advances in World History (New York 2005) 256-77. 21 Most state content standards for teaching world history are available online. For a convenient list of links to each state's content standards for history, see www. historesearch.com/standards.html. 22 The full list of California Content Standards for History at all grade levels is available at http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/hstmain.asp.</page><page sequence="8">60 CLASSICAL WORLD would constitute an ambitious syllabus at the collegiate level. These goals, however, are just two components among many other equally thorough standards to be addressed in the same year, dealing with a similar range of specifics for the Paleolithic Era, Mesopotamia and Egypt, Ancient Hebrews, India, and China. California is not alone in such a model. The Massachusetts State Standards for seventh grade world history and the Virginia State Standards for eighth grade, to list just two, are similar to California's model in both detail and scope.23 While these standards do not prescribe treating as a checklist the outlines they offer, the standards often are employed in just such a way by teachers struggling with the current culture of testing and teacher accountability. While too much specificity plagues some state standards, other state standards are far too broad in how they conceptualize world history and the role of Greece and Rome within it. The Pennsylvania State Standards for teaching world history in ninth grade are an ex ample of this problem. Basic standards ask students and teachers to "analyze the significance of individuals and groups who made major political and cultural contributions to world history prior to 1500"; to "analyze historical documents, material artifacts and historic sites important to world history before 1500"; and to "analyze how conti nuity and change throughout history has impacted belief systems and religions, commerce and industry, innovations, settlement patterns, social organization, transportation, and the roles of women before 1500" in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.24 While admirable for stressing unifying themes over uncontextualized detail, these standards risk teachers and students cherry-picking examples that illustrate a given theme, with no regard for particular historical circumstances. For instance, juxtaposing Asoka, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, and William the Conqueror, without the proper historical context that led to their unique models of rule, is misleading at best, and an unsound approach at worst. When it comes to the "roles of women before 1500," classicists and historians of Greece and Rome debate the changing roles of women just between those two civilizations climaxing within 500 years of one another; how much more confus ing it is to mix indiscriminately the roles of women on all continents for the whole of history prior to 1500. With many of the periodization models discussed above, the problem was a loss of specificity as Greece and Rome were sub sumed into large blocks of time and large themes not necessarily at the center of inward-focused historians of Greece and Rome. In the content standards, we see the opposite problem?the specificity, or in some cases generality, that is expected of students and teachers 23 For the Massachusetts State Standards, see http://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/ hss/final.doc. For the Virginia State Standards, see http://www.pen.kl2.va.us/go/Sols/ history.html#GradeEight. 24 The Pennsylvania State Content Standards for History can be found at http:// www.pde.state.pa.us/stateboard_ed/lib/stateboard_ed/E.HISTORY-web03.pdf.</page><page sequence="9">PAEDAGOGUS 61 misses the strength of world history?namely, a widening of the lens to see new comparisons and interconnectedness between and among world civilizations previously studied in isolation. The problems gen erated by both periodization and the content standards find a clear manifestation in the questions on standardized tests, such as the AP World History Exam, that attempt to gauge student acquisition of these content goals. IV. Greco-Roman History on the AP and SAT II World History Exams A look at the questions about Greece and Rome on standardized tests such as the AP and SAT II reveals what is expected of students? most importantly, how students are expected to contextualize Greece and Rome within world history in order to demonstrate their mastery of it. While there are some good questions, from the perspective of both world history and Greco-Roman history, many of the questions range from oddly specific to strangely comparative, sometimes with possible answers that are confusing or just plain wrong. Since the AP testing-board carefully protects its multiple choice question-bank, the questions used in this article for discussing these issues have been drawn from the various test-preparation books on the market, including Kaplan, Princeton Review, Peterson's, and Barron's. What follows does not deal with every sample question that touches on Greece and Rome, but pulls from the most common types to illustrate the fundamental problems. The oddly specific questions are in some ways the most puzzling, largely because it is hard to tell what world historical knowledge-base they are testing. One example is a question that shows a picture of the Parthenon and then asks for what purpose ancient Athenians used the structure, with potential answers being marketplace, government meeting place, temple, public bathhouse, or museum.25 Another ques tion shows the facade of the Pantheon at Rome and queries which culture's architecture is characterized by the columns on the building, with the options being Indian, Greek, Persian, Russian, or Arabic.26 Apart from these architecture-based questions, other oddly specific questions center on the accomplishments or sayings of one individual. For example, one question inquires: "After the Peloponnesian War, the Macedonians took control of Greece and spread Greek culture throughout much of the known world under the leadership of_," offering as answers Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Hannibal, Pericles, or Socrates.27 Another question asks to whose communica tion network does Herodotus refer in his statement, "neither snow 25 J.

Daniel, A. Kanarek, and A. Freer, The Princeton Review: Cracking the AP World History Exam 2004-2005 Edition (New York 2004) 261.</page><page sequence="10">62 Classical World nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds," with answers being the Hellenistic empire of Alexander, the Byzantine empire of Justinian, the Mongol peace, the Incas, or the Royal Road of Achaemenid Per sia.28 This specificity can even border on being a "trick" question when attribution for the quote, "the unexamined life is not worth living," is sought, with both Plato and Socrates being offered as possible responses (given that the quote comes from Plato's record ing of Socrates' Apology).29 This kind of specific question does not show a student's mastery of broad world historical themes, but rather random recall of details that may or may not be emphasized by a teacher employing a world historical, transregional scope. Questions such as these actually discourage teaching world history designed around significant intersections between classical cultures, and instead encourage the teacher to assault students with a dizzying barrage of detail in the hope that some percentage of it will stick long enough to be recalled by the student in the exam situation. As for the comparative questions, some questions seem to probe issues of real historical significance, while others seem to be interested only in measuring a student's flexibility with the material. In the lat ter category would fall questions that ask, "Which of the following is a major difference between the classic periods in Rome and the Islamic civilizations?"30 "Which of the following was a major problem that led to the decline of both the Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire?"31 or what the Pax Mongolica and Pax Romana had in com mon.32 More useful and meaningful questions center on comparisons between the contemporaneous Roman Empire and the Han Dynasty. Examples of such questions include, "How did the collapse of Han China resemble the Roman Empire's loss of its European lands?"33 28 Martin (above, n.26) 369. 29 Martin (above, n.26) 25. 30 Armstrong et al. (above, n.27) 261; the correct answer being, "While Roman society has strict social class delineations and little mobility, Islam was egalitarian, with few barriers to mobility." For a student who has been taught the role of freed men in the early empire or the adoption of patricians into plebeian families, such a "correct" answer would be somewhat confusing. 31 M. C. Moran and W. F. Holder, Petersons AP World History (Lawrenceville 2005) 307; the correct answer being that "neither empire had a clear policy on the succession of the ruler" among the other options that include "both empires experienced invasions by the Mongols," "rivals competed with one another for power," "revolution aries attempted to effect reforms, but their ideas were opposed," and "a downturn in agricultural process displaced small farmers, this leading to the emergence of a poor and disaffected urban population." 32 Martin (above, n.26) 368; the correct answer being high volume of trade on the silk roads, with other options being common language, common religious beliefs, common currency, and interruption of trade routes by pastoral nomads. 33 McCannon (above, n.25) 434; the "right" answer being, "outside invaders contributed to the collapse of both empires," among options such as, "both were later absorbed by the Byzantine Empire," and "their leaders began to rely on astrology to guide their decision making."</page><page sequence="11">Paedagogus 63 or "Which of the following describes both the Han and the Roman Empires?"34 or a question asking what the classical empires of Rome, India, and Han China had in common.35 While these last three are good comparative questions, it is troubling that the world historical significance of Rome and parallel classical civilizations, for that matter, would seem to be so focused on their "fall" and not on their centuries of flourishing. The most worrisome questions, though, are those which suggest a fundamental misunderstanding or outdated assumption on the part of the test-designers about Greco-Roman antiquity, usually having to do with religion or the law.36 The most troubling question about religion asked, "Which of the following best describes the difference between Chinese and Indian religious systems and Greco-Roman religion?" Possible answers included: "ancestor worship was less important in Chinese and Indian religions than in Greco-Roman religion"; "the gods in Chinese and Indian religion tended to be anthropomorphic"; "Greco-Roman religion relied on offerings to a family of gods and goddesses to gain well being and good fortune"; "women had no part in religious ceremonies in any of the Classical cultures"; and "Greco-Roman religion lacked the spirituality and ethical base that were present in Chinese and Indian religions."37 After struggling over what the answer to this question could possibly be, imagine the horror when flipping to the answer key and finding the following justification for the last answer as the correct one: "Greco-Roman religion did not provide adherents with ethical guidelines for leading a good life nor did it engender a sense of spirituality. . . . The lack of deeper meaning in the official Roman religion was one reason that Christianity gained so many converts in the Roman Empire."38 What about the "deeper meaning" in the mystery religions associated with Bacchus, Isis, and the Magna Mater, which, while not "official," cer tainly were a major feature of Roman period religiosity? What about rites such as the Arkteia in classical Greece, which helped young girls transition, at a personal level, from childhood to marriageable status, or the Bona Dea at Rome, which could have both a civic and a personal meaning for the matronae who participated?39 A similarly problematic question was, "Syncretism is a major feature of which 34 McCannon (above, n.25) 461; with a correct answer that, "their economic and political instability was largely caused by imperial overreach." 35 Martin (above, n.26) 17; with the correct answer being "the threat of foreign peoples along their borders." 36 For questions about Roman law, see Martin (above, n.26), 365; and Armstrong et al.

Apart from the multiple-choice questions and the problems they introduce, the various types of essay questions also pose a problem for the historian of Greece and Rome, and that problem is their lack of coverage. While multiple-choice questions must be explored in test-preparation handbooks, all of the essay questions that have been used by the AP World History testing service are available on-line. Each AP World History test requires three free-response essays: a document-based question (or DBQ), a change- or continuity-over time question, and a comparative question. Since the start of the AP World History exam in 2002, there had been little testing, until the exam in 2006, in essay form of any significant knowledge of Greco-Roman antiquity or much of anything prior to 1000 C.E. for that matter. While the DBQ in 2002 explored the view of merchants by Christianity and Islam to 1000 C.E., only one of the documents was from the classical period (a very brief excerpt from the Gospel of Matthew). Otherwise, the questions explored the impact of Islam from 1000 to 1750, the spread of Buddhism in China, Mongol rule in China, the Middle East and Russia, the Atlantic world from 1492 to 1750, trade patterns from 1750 to the present, responses to the West in nineteenth-century China and Japan, indentured servitude in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, roles of women from 1750 to 1914, labor systems from 1750 to 1914, the 1930s' repercussions of World War I, and twentieth-century Islamic nationalism.42 Only in 2006, along with questions on the global flow of silver from 1500 to 1750 and the revolutionary process in early-twentieth-century Mexico, China, or Russia, was a question that plumbed the depths of students' knowledge of classical civilizations finally posed to test-takers. It is a good question, too: "Analyze the cultural and political changes and continuities in ONE of the following civilizations during the last centuries of the classical era," with students being able to choose between China 100-600 C.E., Rome 100-600 C.E., and India 300-600 C.E. But this is just one question in fifteen over five years of AP exams, and Rome is only one of three options on which students could write. When AP Central has stated that 20 percent of world history courses should focus on the earliest era of its periodization, but then only two essay questions in fifteen test that knowledge in 40 Armstrong et al.

At some point, historians of Greece and Rome must wonder if the curricular design?set forth by massive testing services in conjunction with content standards based on broad models for periodizing world history?will render Greco-Roman history obsolete, or at least drive it from center to periphery. While these criticisms may well be leveled by other specialized fields of history against periodization models, content standards, and the AP testing service, my concern is what Hellenists and Romanists should do about our own marginalization. Perhaps the reason that the history of Greece and Rome is losing ground in these periodization models, content standards, and testing that favor the present is that we are not undertaking the research and scholarship that would necessitate and validate a closer and more extended look at our materials from a world historical point of view. While I would not encourage such research and writing solely in response to a "no-child-left-behind" testing mentality, it is useful to consider briefly what the teaching and scholarship on Greece and Rome has to gain from engaging in world historical thinking. V. The Solution? Doing More Greco-Roman Studies with World Historical Relevance Excoriating the designers of the periodization models, the con tent standards, and AP testing services for their lack of emphasis on Greco-Roman antiquity is criticizing them for what Greek and Ro man historians have not been doing either, namely making significant strides in the application of world historical thinking to Greek and Roman history. What is needed is much more scholarship that would fuel the thinking of both teachers and test-designers. Lesson-plan books, such as Bring History Alive! A Sourcebook for Teaching World History, have some wonderful ideas for encouraging students to apply world historical scope to the classical world. Such questions include, "How do the accomplishments of Asoka compare with those of Alexander of Macedon or the Han emperors of China"; "Compare Asoka's support for Buddhism in India with Roman em perors' treatment of Christianity"; "Compare the nature and uses of unfree labor in the Han, Maurya, and Roman Empires and in the Greek city-states"; and "Compare the roles of the priesthood and monasticism in Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism."43 In order to execute such a lesson plan, though, primary and secondary school teachers, who are already teaching a myriad of other topics, must practically undertake original scholarship. The scholarship that would make the teaching of these issues, and other topics that put Greece and Rome into world historical scope, does not exist to the degree that it ought. 43 R. Dunn and D. Vigilante, eds.

Several recent academic conferences and projects have begun to address this lacuna. A roundtable at the Association of Ancient Historians in May 2006 explored the topic of "Ancient History and/as World History," although the vast majority of the papers at the other panel sessions continued to have very narrow foci. The Committee on Ancient History sponsored a panel on Ancient History and World History at the January 2007 meeting of the APA; but it was only one panel of among no fewer than one hundred sessions that were focused far more narrowly. The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, on the other hand, funded by the Leon Levy Foundation, is a dramatic step in the right direction, with its promise to study antiquity in a way that will "cross traditional geographic and cultural boundaries . . . incorporating not only Europe and the entire Mediterranean basin, but also Central and East Asia."45 The Stanford Ancient Chinese and Mediterranean Empires Comparative History Project similarly promises to make great strides.46 Perhaps 44 There is some good classical world-historical scholarship, but not nearly enough. It is primarily focused on the goods, ideas, peoples, and diseases that moved along the silk roads and other routes between east and west. Representative examples include William McNeill's treatment of diseases in Eurasia in his Plagues and Peoples (Garden City, NY 1976); P. Curtin's chapter on antiquity in his Cross-Cultural Trade in World History (New York 1984); Samuel Lieu's work on Manichaeism, e.g., Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China (Dover 1985); and Manichaeism in Central Asia and China (Leiden 1998); H. J. Klimkeit, Gnosis on the Silk Road (San Francisco 1993); and R. Foltz, Religions of the Silk Road (New York 1999). Earlier scholarship with world historical relevance included W. W. Tarn's The Greeks in Bactria and India (1938), which put the repercussions of Alexander's conquest to the East into a world-historical perspective; and F. Braudel's The Mediterranean and the Mediter ranean World in the Age of Philip II (1949), which attempted to transcend traditional political borders. More recently, see P. Horden and N. Purcell's Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History (Oxford 2000). Other early world-historical perspec tives were offered by F. Hirth, China and the Roman Orient (1885, repr. 1966); and F. Teggart, Rome and China (1939). A more recent attempt to explore Roman-Chinese relations is J. Ferguson, "China and Rome," ANRW II. 9.2 (1978): 581-603. A range of books and articles has attempted to make sense of Rome's relationship with India, including: M. P. Charlesworth, Trade-Routes and Commerce of the Roman Empire (1926); E. H. Warmington, The Commerce between the Roman Empire and India (1928); J. I. Miller, The Spice Trade of the Roman Empire, 29 B.C. to A.D. 641 (1941); M. Wheeler, Rome Beyond the Imperial Frontiers (1955); M. G. Raschke, "New Studies in Roman Commerce with the East," ANRW II.9.2 (1978) 604-1361; S. Sidebotham, Roman Economic Policy in the Erythra Thalassa 30 B.C-A.D. 217 (1986); V. Begley and R. D. de Puma, eds. Rome and India: The Ancient Sea Trade (1991); and now G. Parker, The Making of Roman India (New York 2008). Several classical texts that reveal a great deal about Roman trade with the east, among them the Periplus Maris Erythraei and Isidore of Charax's Parthian Stations, are under-studied by classics students and would be usefully incorporated into classics curricula in order to advance better world historical aims. 45 New York University, Office of Public Affairs, "Institute for the Study of the Ancient World to be Created at NYU with $200 Million Gift," March 21, 2006, http:// www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/1001. 46 W. Scheidel, Homepage for The Stanford Ancient Chinese and Mediterranean</page><page sequence="15">PAEDAGOGUS 67 this up-tick in professional interest will lead to more world historical scholarship from the perspective of Greek and Roman history, thereby having an impact on periodization, content standards, and the ways those standards are taught and tested.47 Historians of Greece and Rome, and classicists as well, should begin to think more seriously about the implications for world history on our work?and not just comparative studies, but also studies of cross-cultural and transregional interaction that would help to make sense of the vast network of exchange that stretched from Britain to China, even in antiquity. In models for thinking, teaching, and testing world history, the focus is shifting eastward and toward the modern. Whatever scholarship Hellenists and Romanists can produce to drop heavy anchors into the Mediterranean basin in the period we call Greco-Roman antiquity may help us to maintain our relevance. If our discipline does not put itself at the center of these debates on world historical periodization and scholarship, we will rapidly find ourselves sidelined to modernist and Sinocentric agendas. Historians and teachers of Greece and Rome underestimate the influence of national and state content standards and testing at the peril of our discipline's relevance. Hellenists and Romanists have met and made significant progress towards addressing such a challenge before. When, in the 1970s, women's studies began to challenge traditional ways of thinking about Greco-Roman antiquity, many of the same issues had to be dealt with then, as now with world history. There was a need to rethink and adapt traditional models of periodizing. Collaboration was necessary. The needs of pedagogy and scholarship were closely interconnected.48 Just as the women's movement of the late twentieth century drove Empires Comparative History Project (ACME) 2005-2006, online at http://www.stan ford.edu/~scheidel/acme.htm. 47 Well after the original composition of this essay, I received in the mail a desk copy of the new edition of Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, Volume One, Beginnings through the Fifteenth Century, eds. R. Tignor, J. Adelman, P. Brown, B. Elman, X. Liu, H. Pittman, and B. Shaw (New York 2008). This textbook was composed by spe cialists in various fields of pre-modern history at Princeton University?notably, from a classicist's perspective, Peter Brown and Brent Shaw?in response to the success of the Princeton-based corporate world-historical pedagogical project that had earlier produced a post-1500 C.E. tome. The guiding principles laid out by the contributors suggest that WTWA is clearly a laudable step in the direction advocated herein (Tignor et al. [above] xxx-xxxv). 48 Barbara McManus discusses these issues as they relate to the scholarship on women in antiquity in Classics &amp; Feminism: Gendering the Classics (New York 1997) 18-19. Merry Wiesner-Hanks has begun to make some of these same comparisons between world history and women's history in her Gender in History (Maiden 2001). This recognition of the parallel paths that gender history has traveled and that world history must still travel is separate from the debate that urges world historians to put gender at the center of the construction of world history. For this, see e.g., J. Zinsser, "And Now for Something Completely Different" in R. Dunn (above, n.7) 476-78 and eadem, "Gender" in Marnie Hughes-Warrington (above, n.20); S. S. Hughes and B.

But most importantly, just as there were tremendous strides to be made in taking a gender-studies approach to Greece and Rome, there is much to be gained again, this time by widening the lens and putting Greece and Rome into world historical perspective.
