<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGINS OF THE CASTE SYSTEM Ebenezer Sunder Raj In order to discuss caste in the context of Indian society, the church and evangelism today, we need to examine its historical, social and religious background. The origin of caste Caste in India has four roots, (a) racial (b) occupational and economic (c) migrational and (d) religious. Racial roots of caste Prehistoric India was inhabited first by the Negritos, later added to by the Proto Austroloids, then by Dra vidians and Mongoloids and finally by the 'Vedic Aryans, who are racially considered Nordics'.1 The Proto Austroloids came from Palestine.2 The Kadars, Pulayans, Irulas, Jarawas of the Deccan and the Andaman hills are today's representa- tives of the Negritoes.3 The Mundas, Santhals, Kols and Bhils of Central India hills represent the Austroloids.4 The Mongoloid family is represented by the north eastern hill tribes. The largest and the most populous race that occupied the entire prehistoric India, barring the north east, was the Dravidians who extended from Sind to Cheranadu. Munshi, Nehru, Nigam, Sagar5 and others point to the advanced Dravidian civilization, language and culture in Northern India. The stratification by colour of the conquered race marks the first step in the development of the Indian caste system. The Vedic Aryans migrated from Eranvej (the present Russian Turkestan) via Iran and Afghanistan into Punjab around 1400 B.C. and exterminated or enslaved the Dravidians, Goetz, Nehru, Watts, Burnouw and Munshi.6 The Rig Veda gives the chronicle of this conquest. These Aryans are related to the Achaeans and Dorians and the racial stock of Germanic north of Europe. Many authorities7 on the Indus civilization point out that the black Dravidians, phallic worshippers of the Indus civilization, were exterminated by the light coloured Aryans. Their 'pūram' (whole) civilization was destroyed and those who were not killed were made slaves. When the Aryans began to spread eastward and south- ward from Punjab, they became spread too thinly. The policy of totally annihilating the Dasyus was found to be impossible. Therefore, the conquered Dasyus were made domestic and village slaves.8 This marks the birth of caste gradation in India. The Dasyu clans were not created but graded by the invading Aryans. The growth of caste gradation in Aryavarta The stratification by colour of the conquered race marks the first step in the development of the Indian caste system.9 According to Zend Avestha, the pre -Vedic Aryan in Iran had a form of three-fold clan division , divided by occupation. This was similar to the clan and trade guild Ebenezer Sunder Raj is Associate General Secretary of the Indian Association of Missionary Societies and North India Field Secretary of the Friends Missionary Prayer Band. groupings in any other civilization around the world, and must not be confused with caste gradation in India. The foundation of caste gradation in India was the divi- sion of the conquered slave (Dasa) race from the Aryan race. The black Dravidians (slave caste) were called Dasa Varna, and the conquerors Arya Varna (master class) . These terms are used in all contemporary Aryan scrip- tures. (As pointed out by Ranade, Sagar, Fedoseyev, Nehru, Ambedkar and Burnouw.10) This division and degradation of the Indian slave from his Aryan master is similar to that of the Helot from the Spartan, the Hebrews from the Egyptians, of the Serfs of Germany, and of the Negroes in Europe, America and South Africa. It is a seal on the slavery of man under man. What was unique to Indian slavery was the divine seal on slavery. This was not challenged for three millennia. Jagjivan Ram, a leader of India's outcastes who achieved high political office, rightly traces today's bonded labour to this slave systém. When the slave trade and slave system was abolished in India by the Slavery Abolition Act of 1843 Smith, the historian, estimated that there were 20 million slaves in India at that time. The state of Travancore alone had about 200,000 slaves.12 Slaves were bought, sold, given as gifts and hired. The slave trade was a matter of elaborate discussions in Brahminical writings.13 One basic reason for the division and segregation was the strong aversion of the Aryans to the native religion . 14 Another was the Dravidians' dark colour, which has been considered by the light coloured around the globe as sure evidence of sub-human species,15 and which has been used to legitimize extermination and slavery. In spite of this scriptural sanction for total segregation, intermarriage continued for a millennium, as the conquest continued both eastwards and southwards. The master assumed an absolute sexual right over his domestic slave women. The Hindu scriptures deal elaborately with the status of children of such masters born to the dasis. 16 This mixing of blood for a millennium resulted in the birth of a considerable population of mixed race people called Shudras or slaves. As a recognition of the partial Aryan descent, the Shudras were admitted, in a restricted sense, as the fourth and last class of the Aryan (noble) community. However, the Upanayana (sacred thread) as a mark of a full Aryan status was denied him. The pure Aryan was called Dwiji (twice born) and the Shudra Adwiji (once born) . The possible danger of intermarriage leading to the loss of the Aryan identity with its cherished culture and religion warranted the most stringent regulations for total segrega- tion between the pure Arya and the pure Anarya (non Aryans). The epics and smritis (the traditional lore) give elaborate records of these religious edicts. Manu the great Aryan lawgiver is the greatest of them. Hitler had this in mind, when he stated in 1935 that 'Nature desires no mixing of a higher race with the lower one. It shows with terrible clarity, that with any mixing of the blood of the Aryan with the lower races, the result was the end of the culture bearer.'17 During the Brahminical and the epic period much liberal social intercourse went on between the three white Aryan castes and the coloured Aryans of Aryavarta (an area of 10</page><page sequence="2">present-day India) . Social intercourse with the Anarya was legislated against and forbidden. This resulted not in a homogenous unity from the four castes but in mushroom- ing of numerous intermediate subcastes and clans.18 The shade of skin colour was the deciding factor in the position in the caste ladder. This colour of skin was an indicator of the percentage of Aryan blood (and religion and culture) , and so formed the first and most important factor in Aryan gradation of ethnic groups of Aryavarta. Occupational and economic roots of caste The second root of caste is occupational and economic: a factor found in all of the ancient civilizations around the world, from Egypt to China. In mono-ethnic civilizations (as in the pre-Vedic Aryans of Iran) occupational division was a matter of socio-economic struggle. Marx19 discusses this in his manifesto. In multi-ethnic civilizations, like India and South Africa, occupation is a matter of ethno-religio us struggle. The conquering, or dominant ethnic group forces the weaker, conquered or enslaved group to adopt lower and menial occupations. The concept of pollution occurs in some form and degree in all civilizations around the world. The dominant ethnic group considered that occupational pollution, taboos and concepts of cleanliness legitimized segregation and the grading of castes, clans or tribes who were engaged in such occupations. The Churas, the cleaners of Punjab, the Chamars, the tanners of Central India, and the Chanars, the toddy tappers of Pandya land were engaged in the types of occupation which were held to be polluted and so were segregated.20 When the caste system has been partially, or even fully, permitted inside the church some 'higher' castes have come into the church, but the lower* castes have stayed away. Also so branded were occupational castes who were either originally involved in these trades or later were alloted them, such as the Suta (charioteer, bard) and Rathakara (chariot keeper).21 This is not unique to Aryan culture. Most civilizations have experienced this in some form or to some degree. The Yalpanar of Ceylon and the Velalan and Kallar of Tamil Nadu are two such distinctly occupational tribes which were later absorbed as castes into this Aryan caste ladder. Migrational roots of caste The third root of caste gradation in India is that of migra- tion. The powerful socio-political and religious upheavals in India of the last three millennia resulted in numerous migrations of ethnic and subethnic groups criss-crossing the country.22 Dandekar23 gives Ambastha, Vaidehaka and Magadha as examples of territorial names which after migration became caste or clan names. The Sourashtras in Tamil Nadu, the Mathuras in Andhra, the Elavas and Syrians in Kerala are typical of thousands of migrational groups which became castes in the later Aryan caste ladder. Religious roots of caste India is more of a multireligious country than any nation in the world. The 1961 Census of India enumerates 59 reli- gions in India. The interaction among these religions (creedal and ethnic) has produced numerous sub-ethno- religions, which are eventually absorbed or classified under Hinduism as castes. The Kabir Panthis, Nanak Panthis, Raidas Panthis, Lingayats, the Narayana Guru Sect, and Šatnami are just a few examples. In three thousand years these four roots produced through their various combinations and interactions the present caste gradation in northern India. While interaction was possible to varying degrees between the castes no interaction or social intercourse was permitted between the Arya and the pure Anarya. Gradually the segregation was made total and eternal. This is the birth date of untouchability in Aryavarta (the land of the Aryans) . Owing to this asprashya dharma, (unclean state of being) , the house slaves had to be isolated from savarna (good caste) houses into Avarna (no caste) isolation. This is the birth of the dasa cheri (harijan colony) in Aryavarta. From then on, the domestic slave-owning system gave way to the practice of the corporate (village) slave system, the Jamani system.24 This has to be recognized in order to understand bonded labour, man mortgage, Padial, Kothadimai, Adiar and other systems of slavery25 extant today. All contemporary Aryan literature carried the most stringent legislation against the untouchable.26 Manu equates the untouchable to the dog and to the dead.27 Not only an untouchable's touch , but also his shadow and sight pollutes the Brahmin , 'the paragon of purity' . 28 Ambedkar opines this system 'worse than slavery'.29 Class division or slavery is evident in the early history of Egypt, China, Rome, Japan, Iran, Britain, Ireland and Germany. But nowhere did it petrify into the rigidity of the caste system in Aryavarta with untouchability under the 'divine' sanction and injunction of unscrupulous vested interests.30 Caste gradation of Dravidian peoples The non Aryan populations of the Deccan plateau in central and south India had ethnic, clan and in some cases totemic, endogamous divisions. As found in most civiliza- tions, they married within the ethnic unit. Ethnic gradation was absent, however. There were economic and occupa- tional differences between communities, as in every society. But caste gradation was unknown and untouch- ability unheard of, as evidenced by the Samgam literature. Dandekar, Munshi, Majumdar,31 and others speak of the Aryan missionary expansion into the Dravidi country, the routes of their migration, their missionary and conver- sion methods and the resulting cultural absorption- a process now called sanskritisation . This missionary effort resulted in Brahmins becoming priests for the Dravid sacred order, first in the Royal and Zamindari courts and subsequently in the urban and semi-urban communities.32 The rural south, and any area where Brahmins were not present, escaped such sanskritisation.33 In the south Brahminical supremacy was created and protected with the utmost care due to the lessons learnt from the loss of royal patronage to Buddhism in the Mauryan kingdom of the north . Every care was taken to annihilate or subjugate faiths or traditions that, were a possible threat to this domination. The Kugaiyidik- kalagam, Kazhuvetral34 and other religious upheavals in the south, tell us of Brahminical domination through the persecution of Buddhist, Jain and native faiths of the south.35 However, this process was neither easy nor total. The wide gulf which existed between the philosophic impersonal nature worship of the Aryan and the animistic anthropomorphic faith of the Dravidian brought out the best in the Brahmin creativity as they invented mytho- logies to bridge this gulf. As a result when Arya dharma, 11</page><page sequence="3">the Vedic Vamashra dharmia (vedic caste religion) was transplanted by the Brahmin missionaries to the non Aryan south, it essentially accommodated the hetero- genity of the southern native faiths. It was not just mass conversion of native peoples but mass conversion of native gods to Brahminic religion. This truth is brought out precisely by Swami Vivekananda. Defending Varnashra dharma he retorted, 'No man was challenged in the selection of his Ishta Devatha (personal gods) or his preceptors (teachers and The mission compound orphan has fared very poorly as a Christian as he has no sense of accountability to others for want of a sense of belonging'. gurus) and religion grew as it grew nowhere else. On the other hand a fixed point was necessary to allow this infinite variation to religion, and society was chosen as that point.'36 The present Sankaracharya of Kamakoti Peetam, (who is thought to be a reincarnation of the nineteenth century philosopher, Sankaracharya) makes no secret of the fact that the varnashta system was the foundation of the Hindu religion, and that Hinduism would vanish if it were abolished.37 Thus the stratification of ethnic and sub-ethnic groups and clans was the only visible initiating ceremony and mark of the conversion of the Dravidi populations to Arya Dharma. No upanyayana (sacred thread ceremony of the twice born) was performed on them as they were all racially Dravidians and therefore Anarya and Adwiji. Here again there was a big problem. On what basis will the Varnashrama caste ladder be built for the Dravidians? On the basis of colour or Aryan intermarriage and blood? Neither was possible. The great King Karikalan was just as black as the Paraya Valluvar. (The insignificant inter- marriage there was in the south was a much later develop- ment.) Occupational differences were chosen as a handy device. Kings, petty rajas, warrior clans and warrior tribes were made Kshatriyas (warrior caste) . This step eternally guaranteed material and religious dominance for the Brahmin. The existing class of traders, craftsmen and artisans were made Vaisyas (tradesmen caste). The peasants and unclassified public were to become the Shudras. This was a carbon copy of the classification of the north,38 which positioned the Brahmin securely as Bhudeva (god on earth) . But there cannot be nobles (Arya) without slaves. The lowest economic clans and communities, prisoners, migrating clans and those engaged in ceremonially pollut- ing trades were made the untouchables. (Chidambaram Pillai, Thurston39 and all ethnographers and historians concur on this.) The main aim of the sanskritisation of the south, became not the conversion of the Dravidians to Arya dharma but enforcement of Brahminic Varnashra dharma; an excel- lent device in the hands of the Brahmins to practise divide and rule.40 This same process is happening today to the non Aryan tribais of Central India and the north east. Wherever Aryanisation is in process, Varnashra dharma is enforced; the egalitarian tribal clans and totemic groups are graded vertically by the Aryan missionary in the Brahminic caste ladder, as the only viable mark of Aryanisation. The same results can be seen too: caste superiority, and the comple- mentary inferiority; the strata of divisions and subdivi- sions; untouchability and the annihilation of a positive self image for those who are made low.41 The essence of popular Hinduism is casteism, as endorsed even by Gandhiji himself.42 If a Naidu or Nair boy comes to Chris- tian faith, the hue and cry made about it is not that he has spoiled 'our faith' but 'our caste'. Reflections on the above discussions All civilizations around the world have endogamous, clan, tribal, racial or trade groupings and castes of varying degree and kind. Caste is not the invention of the Brah- mins, but caste gradation. The Brahmins, the custodians of Arya dharma built upon the existing form and pattern of society the Brahminic caste system, incorporating into it the other factors of slavery and religion on the migrational, occupa- tional and pollutional elements knit with the steel reinforcements of Karma and reincarnation. While the Brahminic caste system in Aryavarta was almost entirely socio-religious, the system enforced on non Aryan peoples was almost entirely socio-political; a super stratagem for eternal Brahminic domination over non Aryan peoples. The Census of India 1901 states the 'acceptance of the supremacy of Brahmin' as the first of the ten marks of a Hindu.43 The only reason that the vast multitudes, tongues, races and people groups in India first yielded to and eventually succumbed to this Brahminic stratagem, was the inherent human desire to belong to 'his own' people; to cherish and preserve his ancestry, lineage, identity, his way of life, culture and blood. Unfortunately, the Anglo Saxon Pro- testant missions of the nineteenth century did not adequately see this point. The first challenges to Varnashra dharma were soon made by Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Kabir panthis and the smaller socio-religious egalitarian movements of the middle ages. The Brahminic reaction against such move- ments meant that the religion often emerged with greater strength than before. The Christian challenge to Brahminic caste system The first irrevocable change came with evangelical missions. Protestant missions eroded the Brahminic caste system.44 The resulting socio-religious upheavals gave birth to Hindu protestantism, the Hindu Renaissance. Forrester45 has commendably analysed the Protestant church's critique and response to caste in the last 100 years. What emerges is that with the exception of Islam, the pre -Christian egalitarian socio-religious movements did not generally succeed in re-ordering the vertical Brahminic caste system. They lacked an adequate theological foundation and for 3 millennia Brahminism, almost without interruption, held unassailable religious power and royal backing. Before Zeigenbalg, the first Protestant missionary, the Christian challenge to the caste system was negligible. The first dent was made by the evangelical missions. Protestant missions varied widely in their theology, understanding, presuppositions and approach in handling the Brahminic caste system. This had much to do with the missionaries' own cultural, educational, theological, social and economic backgrounds. However, they were unanimous that the Aryan caste system was fundamentally incompatible with Christian tenets. The British civil government used the expedient policy of maintaining the status quo in socio-religious matters. 12</page><page sequence="4">But its attempt to establish an objective judiciary and police became the backbone of the Christian missionary's effort to emancipate the outcaste. This, in effect, inflicted the first mortal wound on the Brahminic caste system. Post-colonial Christianity has found adequate provision in the Constitution of India for its prophetic ministry of the re-ordering of the unjust structure of society. The constitu- tion is often openly criticized as being too 'Christian'. The Christians' presence and preaching, however weak or incomplete it may be steadily works against Karma and reincarnation and therefore against the caste system itself. While we must admit that this evil system is found to some extent in some Christian congregations it is nevertheless much less evident inside the Church than outside. Where intercaste or noncaste egalitarian brotherhood has been made a condition for entry to the church, masses of lower' classes entered (the term is used in the Brahminical sense). When the caste system has been partially, or even fully, permitted inside the church some 'higher' castes have come into the church, but the 'lower' castes have stayed away. The conversions of many Hindus and some Christians to Islam in 1980-83 in Tamil Nadu are pointers to this fact.46 Conclusion The Syrian model, the Robert De Nobili model, the Parava model, and today's CSI (Church of South India) and CPM (Ceylon Pentecostal Mission) models are all widely vary- ing and imperfect ways that God has nevertheless used to bring individuals and families to Himself.47 Missions and churches have made the mistake of trying to deduce one code of conduct and one policy for evangelism from the above models of churches and peoples. The search is futile. There is not one set of teachings for every member of a local congregation, nor one set of standards for every age . Here are a few tentative suggestions I wish to make from my mission field experience. The equality of all men as the Creation of God and the brotherhood of all believers under the Fatherhood of God must be included, in detail, in all articles of faith, state- ments of doctrine, constitutions of religious bodies and in the ecclesiastical terms of service. There should be a punitive clause for any believer who denies this tenet. The local church as the salt and light of society must keep ahead in articulating this doctrine, in front of all other secular or religious reformatory forces. The Church's preaching calendar must allot one Sunday a year as 'Brotherhood Sunday' - a day for preaching against the Brahminic Caste System in the Church. All Christian journals and magazines should allot one issue a year for such teaching. All Sunday School Christian education material in India should include one chapter or lesson on the subject. Christian journalists in the media should write regularly against this evil using a sound Biblical foundation. Christian publishers should publish books and booklets on the Christian view of caste for both Christian and non- Christian readers. The appointment of any religious staff, such as pastors, bishops, missionaries, and all ecclesiastical leaders such as the committee members of a diocese , synod, or federation should only be made on the condition that they take a spouse of a 'lower' caste. Incentives should be introduced to encourage inter- caste marriages. The church should waive marriage fees for intercaste marriages. It could institute funds for such intercaste marriages . The Church and other Christian institutions could even make provision for rapid job promotions for such people who marry between castes. All the above recommendations on 'caste' almost equally apply to 'class'. Even sincere evangelicals who may revile 'caste' prejudice are often seen to be prone to 'class' prejudice in their preaching and in their practice. However, since 'class' has an ambiguous boundary, it evades concrete steps of remedy to recommend here. Renouncing caste consciousness cannot be made a condition for entering the church. There is no Biblical warrant for this. If the Church insisted on such a thing it would prevent the very process of change. This could destroy all the pastoral enquiry that has been built by the 'Coming in' to a community of the church need not and must not legitimize homogenous "staying in' to the exclusion of other communities. church over two millennia. While renouncing the worship of evil spirits must be made a condition for entering the Church, renouncing the fear of evil spirits cannot be made a condition. Any man who fully subscribes to the equality of men, but shows greater affinity to his own people has not violated any Christian principle. Caste in his case is a sense of identity and belonging, as it is with the Ao Naga and Vasavi tribes. Caste when stripped of the Brahminic Varnashra System, is reduced to a non-Hindu clan identity - that of its pre Aryan form. The problem inside the church lies at the pulpit and not the pew. The extreme paucity of teaching on caste from the pulpit in an average church is one of the major reasons for the persistance of Varnashrama inside the Church. A sense of physical belonging to one's people is essential for full Christian growth. Mission field experience consistently indicates this. The mission compound orphan has fared very poorly as a Christian as he has no sense of accountability to others for want of a sense of 'belonging'. There is no person in the Bible who became God's channel to a people who was devoid of a deep sense of 'belonging' to that group. This sense of 'belonging' to a clan or to an ethnic group will have to continue until social change results in alternative structures and a different sense of community. The crux is not what type of community, but the actual sense of 'belonging to a people'. 'Coming in' to a community of the church need not and must not legitimize homogenous 'staying in' to the exclusion of other communities. Such failure is due to lack of discipling in the average church, not the fault of the disciple. We dare not block people entering the church for fear of possible 'mixed motives' . No one under the sun has ever entered the church without 'mixed motives'. There is no one rule of behaviour for all churches, for all times, for all people. As long as there is a process of gradual discipleship - the process of learning and obedience to the teaching of the church - not only Varnashrama, but every other evil will be overcome. 1. K. M.
