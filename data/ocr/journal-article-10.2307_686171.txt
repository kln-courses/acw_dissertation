Two abiding passions inform Freud's thought and writings: to understand the human heart and to set this understanding on a 'scientific' footing. Given his philosophical sensibilities, Freud found himself forced to take philosophical positions at every turn in the development of his views. The views themselves could not have been developed without facing philosophical problems. His contributions are, therefore, of intrinsic interest to the philosopher. It is impor- tant to be clear about Freud's philosophical presuppositions, to discuss them critically, and also to work through oneself the philosophical problems that faced him, if one is to appreciate his contribution. This kind of criticism is best represented in the present collection by Wittgenstein's 'Conversations on Freud' and Jerome Neu's long piece on 'Genetic Explanation in Totem and Taboo'. This task calls for intelligence, imagination and philosophical penetration. But there is another, complementary task, which is also essential if one is to cut through to Freud's insight into the human heart,' and this takes a special kind 1 See Wisdom [I953], p. 261.</page><page sequence="2">192 The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science of sensitivity. Such sensitivity is best represented in the selection from Fingarette's book on Self-deception and Brian O'Shaughnessy's essay on 'The Id and the Thinking Process'. In its coverage this collection is fairly comprehensive. The essays vary in their philosophical approach and in the character of the sympathy they show for Freud's views. David Pears' essay is called 'Freud, Sartre and Self-deception', but its connection with Sartre is very tenuous and it contains nothing about Freud whatever. In fact the level of abstraction at which Pears operates and his intellectualism are hardly conducive to contact with what is at the heart of Freud's contribution. Peter Alexander, who at one level is 'in general sympathy with Freud's position', fares little better in this respect. I think that the excellent discussion of what Alexander says by Theodore Mischel shows this very clearly. Mischel's paper is short (pp. 322-31), but he does more than anyone I have read to bring out what Freud had in mind when he spoke of slips of the tongue in the way he did. His discussion of what it means for a patient to accept a psycho- analytic explanation of something he did, although equally brief, is also very good. Judging purely from what he says here he seems to be a philosopher who has learnt much from Wittgenstein. It is, however, interesting to note the difference in their relation to Freud when they write about him. What Wittgen- stein says in the 'Conversations', though philosophically penetrating, has a certain ambivalence which would have prevented him from giving Freud a more sympathetic study, using his own important contributions to philosophical psychology to cut through to the more positive aspects of Freud's thought. Stuart Hampshire, in his piece on 'Disposition and Memory', gives us an excellent example of this kind of work. He has obviously learnt much from Wittgenstein, yet what he says is the result of years of philosophical labour very much his own. In fact what we find in these pages (pp. 113-3 i) is a continuation of the work we find in his very interesting Inaugural Lecture at University College London in 1960 under the title 'Feeling and Expression'. For me 'Disposition and Memory' is the most interesting piece in the present collection. Hampshire's essay divides into two parts. In the first part (pp. I113-2o) he is concerned to elucidate the sense in which a person's mental states can exist independently of and in separation from the various expressions which they normally find in human life, thus constituting the texture of his inner life. This inner life, Hampshire argues, is a dimension which a child's life gradually acquires as he learns to identify his emotions and inclinations, to put them into words, and thereby to control them. This is made possible because these emotions and inclinations have natural expressions (Wittgenstein) which are in the first place constitutive of the emotions and inclinations themselves (p. 118). It enables their range to be extended (p. I15). More than this, it also extends the range within which he can exercise his will: 'Because the child may know what it is he is inclined to do, the question of whether he will do it comes up as a question for him to decide. He may decide to restrain his inclination to do something' (p. 115). 'His full inner life begins with his power of intentional inhibition' (p. 116). Hampshire's argument is that the use of language in the communication of emotions and inclinations and the inhibition of the actions they prompt are learnt in harness. The development of an inner life and the development of intentional states (the extention of the limits within which the</page><page sequence="3">Reviews I93 will is operative so that it makes sense to speak of the 'freedom of the individual") are thus the two sides of the same coin. In the second and more controversial part of his paper Hampshire begins by observing that the earliest behaviour of children already give hints of an inner life. He adds that the child has not as yet learned to avow what he feels and so he cannot be said to be aware of it. What he says here (top of p. 121) is not clear to me. He speaks of 'dispositions and inclinations that are repressed' and says that their 'signs', which cannot be intentional at this stage, have to be read by a third person. When he speaks of 'inhibited dispositions' here I take him to mean something akin to 'the inhibition of a trained animal'-e.g. 'of a dog trained to restrain its natural inclination to bite something' (p. I 15). But in that case, how can Hampshire speak of an 'inner life' in the sense elucidated in the first part of his paper? The gist of his answer is that when the adult remembers his childhood, the continuity that he discerns between past and present patterns, allows him to read present intentional expressions of feeling into the past patterns (p. 121). I do not find this answer satisfactory. Let me make this clear: I find it makes good sense for a person to look back on his past and see it in a different light from the one he saw it in at the time. In some such cases the continuity between the past and the present may justify us in saying that he was deceived, that his own mental state was other than he thought at the time, that his present apprehension of it is correct.2 But in that case it must be possible for this person to have deceived himself, or at least to have been deceived, at the time. Yet how could this be if the time in question is a pre-verbal stage of his life? What I question, therefore, is whether at that stage an inclination is separable from its behavioural expression so as to constitute an element of the child's inner life. But if it isn't, can we speak of the 'unconscious' at that stage? What Hampshire says about the notion of unconscious memories and the way such memories are operative in the present, influencing inclinations and conduct, is I think very good. I also think that Hampshire is absolutely right in finding a wide area of the influence of the past on the present which is not causal in character, but is a matter of the past continuing to live in the present and setting its seal on it. This is something that has been persistently misunderstood by most philosophers writing on Freud. Hence, for instance, going back to 1922, Professor Field asks: 'What I want to know is why the effect which the event produced on the person should be described as if the original event somehow went on existing and working?' The answer is that what is in question is not an event, but a thought or phantasy, nor merely one that the subject can recollect, but one which haunts him, though he does not recognise it. Surely this is the kind of thing that Freud has in mind when he writes: ... the exciting experience continues in some way to be effective even years after, not indirectly by means of a chain of causes linking up with one another, but directly as the actual exciting cause-just as, for instance, the recollection of mental distress in full consciousness at some later period may stimulate tears (Collected Papers, vol. i, p. 29). x Significantly this is the title of one of Hampshire's books. 2 I have argued this in two different papers: Dilman [I959] and [I972].</page><page sequence="4">194 The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science This is the passage which ends with the famous words: 'hysterical patients suffer principally from reminiscences' (1892). Philosophers who have seen in Freud's abandonment of his early theories of seduction for the notion of traumatic phantasies nothing but a way of evading the possibility of refutation, have I think failed to appreciate that what we have here is an important step in the development of the Freudian conception of the unconscious and its importance in human life. What that importance amounts to, how it can restrict the sphere in which a man is capable of taking decisions or changing his mind, and how increasing the domain of consciousness and self-knowledge can restore the power to act differently-this is well discussed in the remaining part of Hampshire's paper-though necessarily the discussion is brief and coarse-grained. In a more detailed discussion it would be important to bring out the differences between ways in which one's past may hold one captive and ways in which recollection, re-living, and a reappraisal of one's present and past can bring increased freedom. Here one should beware of a one-sided diet of examples. I now turn to the other contributions. Wollheim is right in wanting to connect 'identification' with 'imagination', but I think that he makes heavy weather of it in his philosophical argument. Also I think that he uses the notion of some- thing 'internal' uncritically. He says that he 'should like to start by taking seriously a suggestion made by Wittgenstein ... to the effect that, if we want to understand the nature of an inner phenomenon, we do well to consider an external counterpart of that phenomenon' (p. 181). But here 'internal' and 'external' should be in inverted commas. Wittgenstein wanted to combat the idea that one cannot give an adequate account of a mental phenomenon without referring to some internal episode or component. His criticism was that here one is looking in the wrong dimension, that one should turn one's attention to what he called 'the surrounding circumstances'. This is not to deny the existence of what I can keep to myself, but to claim that its character is logically dependent on its relation to what finds expression in human behaviour in particular circumstances. Wollheim's argument is that you cannot distinguish identification from imitation without bringing in imagination, and that doing so is in part to refer to something internal-almost as if to say that imitation lacks the inner dimension of identification. I agree that identification 'cannot be elucidated in exclusively behavioural terms' (p. 175). But it does not follow from this that it 'must be regarded as containing essentially an internal com- ponent' (ibid.). Why should not one say that identification is imitation in special circumstances-circumstances which remain to be elucidated? This is not to exclude a reference to the subject's thoughts and imaginings. But to understand what it means to have a thought or to imagine something we need to turn our attention to the language in which these are given expression and the kinds of activity in the weave of which this language is used. It is here that we shall find the logic peculiar to a thought or imagining, not in any additional component.' The collection contains three papers on the question of the verification of psycho-analytic claims-general claims and particular interpretations. The first by Wesley Salmon was written in 1959- I find it philosophically crude and doctrinaire, though not devoid of penetration. In the first part Salmon argues 1 See my [I968], p. 97.</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 195 that the 'principle of determinism' which Freud embraced is not the same as the kind of principle Hume resorts to in an attempt to 'justify induction', but is a posteriori. There is something right about this, though I cannot here bring out what it is.' In the second part of his paper Salmon deals with the charge that many psycho-analytic claims about what is unconscious are so formulated as to be immune to falsification. I believe what he says to be essentially correct. His view, very briefly, is that no 'few restricted items of behaviour can constitute conclusive evidence for or against the hypothesis ... [it] must be judged on the weight of total evidence' (p. 280). He illustrates well what he means. Clark Glymour defends the view that 'there is a rational strategy for testing important parts of psycho-analysis... that relies almost exclusively on clinical evidence' (p. 287). 'Clinical' here is contrasted with 'experimental', and Glymour compares clinical testing with the kind of strategy that Kepler followed in testing his laws of planetary motion. J. O. Wisdom writes on 'Testing an Interpretation within a Session'. He formulates and examines the criteria used by psycho-analysts in judging whether the interpretations they give to their patients are correct. It is in the response of their patient to their interpretation that they look for confirmation. This raises at least two difficulties which J. O. Wisdom discusses: (i) that the response is brought about by the interpretation itself and may be the work of suggestion; (ii) that whether the response is or is not taken to confirm the interpretation depends on what one makes of it, which is itself a matter of interpretation, so that it looks as if one interpretation is tested by another. The paper is interesting and its author knows what he is writing about, but I do not find the way he meets these difficulties adequate. I mentioned O'Shaughnessy's paper on 'The Id and the Thinking Process' which I like. There is a more general paper on 'Freud's Anatomies of the Self' by Irving Thalberg. It is a learned paper in which Thalberg traces the develop- ment and changes in Freud's conception of the divisions of the self, classifies the different analogies that dominated his thinking, and illustrates these with apt quotations. But despite the impressive subdivisions of the paper I find Thalberg's philosophical criticism a bit thin. Also the paper does little to promote an understanding of what is of positive value in Freud's thinking here, in the way that O'Shaughnessy does. Ronald de Sousa's paper 'Norms and the Normal' is the one paper in this collection I do not know what to make of philosophically. David Sachs in his paper 'On Freud's Doctrine of Emotions' attributes to Freud the view that a person's emotional responses, however incongruous or disproportionate they may appear to be, can be seen never to be so in reality if one takes into account his thoughts, beliefs, conceptions, etc., and the significance which things have for him. He tries to clarify this view and to show that if one appreciates that Freud held such a view, even though he may never have formulated it, this would give one 'a somewhat novel outlook upon his thought' (p. 133), namely a view that 'Freud's vision was a vision of the normalcy and health that, however obstructed or baffled, lie behind neurosis and psychosis'. The paper does raise interesting questions. Fredric Weiss writes about 'Meaning and Dream Interpretation'. What he argues is in some ways similar to what Malcolm says in the Appendix of his 1 See my [1973].</page><page sequence="6">196 The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science book on Dreaming entitled 'Dreams and Psychiatry'. He expresses it in a kind of style I associate with Existentialism and Phenomenology: 'A dream-report is a peculiar object, in the respect that it may have a meaning-of its own, but it has no public meaning. If there is a meaning-of a dream-report, it is a meaning- for the subject. He gave it it; it is idiosycratic; it is something that he means' (p. 67). Margaret Boden's paper is about Freudian Mechanisms of Defence and Computer Simulations of them. The largest part of the paper (section III) is concerned to give a clear factual account of such computer programmes. It is preceded (section II) by a short account of Freud's notion of 'defence mechanism' and followed (section IV) by an equally brief discussion of the limitations of such programmes. Her modest claim (if I understand her rightly) is very roughly this: You have to be very clear about the kind of thing you are writing a programme for a computer to simulate. Thus in writing and studying such programmes we shall be able to get a clear view about something we already know without being clear about its character and implications-something akin to conceptual clarification carried via a formalised language. But, of course, the greater the logical distance between the programme and what it is supposed to illuminate the dimmer will be the light it sheds on it. I am not acquainted with the work of K. M. Colby whose programmes Margaret Boden discusses, but I cannot say that I found much illumination in what she presents in her paper, though it is an able presentation and a clearly written and balanced paper. The three papers by Thomas Nagel, Robert Solomon and John Marshall deal with Freud's early work in physiological psychology, its intrinsic philo- sophical interest, and its importance for understanding Freud's later more purely psychological contributions. Both Nagel and Solomon maintain that Freud was and remained a physicalist throughout the evolution of his thoughts. Both are concerned to defend this position as philosophically viable. Although they quote extensively from Freud's writings, it seems to me that both are more interested in the philosophical position illustrated in these passages than in Freud. In fact, I think that these passages, though certainly of intrinsic philo- sophical interest, are a dead-end for understanding Freud. I have personally found some of the things that Freud says in the Project and other early writings interesting in almost the opposite way, namely for containing the kernel of the kind of vision he was to develop in his maturity. In other words, I see the later Freud foreshadowed in his early writings, rather than the later Freud clinging to early philosophical positions. Insofar as these early philosophical positions remained with him-and they did-they were more of an encumbrance that prevented Freud from giving a clear expression to his insights. I believe that philosophy, if used with imagination, can help one to cut through this surface to the real content of Freud's contribution. It seems to me that in 'Freud's Anthropomorphism' Nagel's abstract philosophical preoccupations prevent him from gaining a proper understanding of Freud-e.g. his conception of the unconscious mind. In contrast, John Marshall's paper 'Freud's Psychology of Language' is more modest and also philosophically more illuminating. Jerome Neu's paper on 'Genetic Explanation in Totem and Taboo' is a searching, thoughtful piece, in which he is patient with what he criticises and raises many penetrating questions.</page><page sequence="7">Reviews 197 To sum up, this philosophical collection on Freud contains twenty-one pieces on various aspects of Freud's contribution. They are all competent, though written from diverse philosophical points of view, and I have personally found six or seven of them really good and I learned from reading them-these, in the order in which they were arranged, are the pieces by Wittgenstein, Fingarette, Hampshire, O'Shaughnessy, Clark Glymour, Theodore Mischel and Jerome Neu.
