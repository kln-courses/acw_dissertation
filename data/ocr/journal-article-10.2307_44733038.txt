Nice Aerazur Jean-Louis Thonnard and Leon Plaghki Université Catholique de Louvain ABSTRACT The development phase of the Hermes EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) Space Suit Glove began with a review of EVA Glove literature and a parallel study of hand biomechanics. The glove had three principal layers; Bladder, Restraint and Thermal Micrometeoroid Protection, (TMP). Range of motion, strength, tactile perception, dexterity, fatigue and comfort were assessed through the test programme. The testing revealed a decrease in performance Thermal contact testing was performed with the glove interfaced to a US Shuttle EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit). Further evaluation was performed with the glove interfaced to a Soviet Orlan DMA suit. The testing identified a number of glove improvements. INTRODUCTION This paper describes the development of the Hermes EVA Space Suit Glove between August 1989 and July 1991, (known as Phase CI). The term EVA is used to describe all activities performed in space by a crew member outside the pressurized environment of a manned spacecraft. The EVA Space Suit System must provide the crew member protection from the harsh environment of space, whilst allowing the performance of a wide range of manipulative tasks. The hand is essential to EVA and astronauts experiences with EVA gloves have documented major problems with hand dexterity, loss of tactility and fatigue^). Thus the development of the EVA glove is considered to be one of the most demanding technological tasks in the whole space suit design. The Hermes EVA Space Suit System glove is required to operate at 500hpa (7.25psi) during a possible mission length of 7 hours. It must protect the hand from a wide range of hazards including vacuum, radiation, thermal, UV, ionizing, micrometeoroids, space objects, sharp edges and chemical attack. However, the glove must also allow the crew member to perform tasks with his or her hands. The above criteria are obviously contradictory and there exists an interrelation between protection and performance that must be balanced. The mission profile of the EVA had not been fully detailed, thus the design philosophy was to build an anthropomorphic glove which would afford the crewmember a close as possible bare hand performance. HAND BIOMECHANICS As a prelude to the glove design tasks, a hand biomechanics study(2) was performed. This work comprised two parts, an oriented literature survey in order to understand the hand functions and, based on this information, the development of a series of standardized test procedures designed to be conducted in a glove box with the EVA glove at operating pressure. LITERATURE SURVEY - The literature survey on hand biomechanics focused on four domains: mobility, strength, tactility and dexterity^). The most relevant features were stated as follows. Mobility of the wrist occures both at the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints. Consequently, it appears essential to keep mobility of the carpus. We have also noted that the second and third matacarpals constitute the fixed part of the arching hand. On the ulnar side, the ring and little metacarpals have considerable mobility and on the radial side, the thumb moves freely through a wide arcW. The prehensile movements of the hand can be sorted in two distinct patterns termed power grip and precision grip. During these activities, fatigue occures following exercises at levels as low as 5% of maximal strength. Yet decreases in strength become most evident in all efforts exceeding 20% of maximal strength (5). These observations suggest that a person can work for a long period of time without undue fatigue if the tension exerted during the contraction phase of activity does not exceed 20% of maximal strength. This information is essential since several studies have shown that grip strength may be reduced up to 38% by wearing industrial gloves^) and 40% to 50% by wearing pressurized EVA gloves^ &gt;^) During grip a close interplay exists between sensory mechanism related to explorative functions of the fingers and motor mechanism controlling the muscles of the hand. The balance, or coordination, between the magnitudes of the grip and load forces may be critical^). Too weak a grip force causes slippage, whereas too firm a grip may lead to muscle fatigue 826</page><page sequence="2">and/or destruction of a fragile object as well as causing injuries to the hand. The spacial acuity of tactile sensibility in the hand is characterized by a pronounced regional variation. The density of afferent units is maximal at the finger tips, which are the prcfered site for tactual exploration, and decrease towards the wristW. Therefore, it seems important to minimize the reduction of tactility at the finger tips. It has also been shown that a large group of tactile afferent units respond to movements of the hand and finger joints when direct touch is not involved^). They are sensitive to the changing patterns of tension within the skin which occur with joint movements. Consequently, in order to preserve a maximum of these inputs, it is primary: (a) to lessen restriction of motor activity induced by the gloves and; (b) to conserve shearing forces through the skin produced by manipulation of objects when wearing gloves. Therefore, the glove suppleness and its fit to the hand appear as decisive features. Frictional conditions between the object and the glove may also influence the static grip force and consequently fatigue^). A high coefficient of friction lends to reduce the static grip force. Ideally, gloves should be designed so that objects could be handled with the minimum force required to prevent slippage. Although the design of the gloves is of primary importance in reducing the demand on soft tissues, it is also necessary to keep in mind two oilier paramount features: (a) the nature of the task and the proper design of the tools; (b) the capability for the subject wearing the gloves to increase performance by a learning process. It has been shown that improperly specified and designed hand tools result in frequent injuries and lost performance capability^®). The design of hand tools should contribute to a reduction of biomechanical stresses on the hand and to a significant decrease of musculoskeletal affections. DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED TEST PROCEDURES - The second task in this work on hand biomechanics has been to develop a series of standardized test procedures for determining the effects of EVA gloves on each of the four principal human-hand performances mentioned above. This battery of tests will enable: . the evaluation of performances with different types of gloves, but also; . the evaluation of the learning process performed by a subject wearing a given glove as the test may be repaeted over lime. All the standardized test procedures have been designed to be conducted in a glove box with the EVA glove at operating pressure. CONCEPT TRADE-OFF The ideal solution at this stage in the development would be to have built and tested several concepts. However, due to the restraints of Phase CI, it was only planned to design and build one glove Breadboard, (BB). Thus a classic trade-off matrix was constructed, with functions against possible solutions plotted. For each element of the glove, a possible five design concepts were identified. The design concepts were then subjected to selection criteria, and thus the baseline concept identified. EVA GLOVE DESIGN These works yielded a custom sized tri-elcment EVA glove concept aimed at maximum performance. The three elements, or layers, were: . Bladder - inner gas retention layer, . Restraint - intermediate load retention layer, . Thermal Micromcteroid Protection Garment, (TMP) - outer protection layer. Although each of these elements have their own specific functions, they were all designed with the hand functional performance requirements in mind. As the glove was designed to be custom sized, hand moulds were taken of the selected subject; in the relaxed position, for bladder fabrication, and in various flexed and extended positions in order to take measurements for glove design tasks. The "relaxed" hand mould was also digitized to form a 3-D CAD model, (Fig.l), for further design evaluations. Fig.l CAD Hand Model BLADDER - The bladder is the gas retention layer of the glove. In order to avoid adverse torque upon the joints, the bladder was made slightly larger than the load retention restraint (approximately 1mm linearly). To give single degree of freedom motion at joint locations, convolutes were anthropomorphically provided, (Ref Fig.2). 827</page><page sequence="3">Fig.2 lì ladder Convolutes. The calculation of these convolutes was as follows: . The measurement of the human joint elongation, Dl, whilst bending from the subjects hand and with correlation from measurements taken from the plaster hand moulds in different positions. . A convolute provides an elongation that is the difference between half a circle circumference and its diameter, thus, Pi*R-2R = R*(Pi-2) = 1.14*R Due to the physical constraints, the radius of a convolute is limited to 4mm, hence the number of convolutes at a given joint, N, is; Ν = D1/(1.14*R), with iterations on R values between 1 and 4mm. The bladder has a 1mm over thickness in order to allow for an easy don/doff. The bladder was manufactured from muliple dipped latex, with a neoprene flange bonded to provide the interface requirements. Latex was chosen for case of prototyping. RESTRAINT - The restraint is the load bearing intermediate layer of the glove. As such, the requirements placed upon the restraint are the most stringent within the glove section in terms of performance, (ref Fig.3). The restraint can, itself, be split into five elements: . Fingers, . Palm Control System, . Thumb Metacarpal Joint, . Wrist Joint, . Restraint Body. The finger body design was based on a braid concept. The braid is a loose weave cylinder, (made from polyamid 6.6), with the thread construction angle depending upon finger size, (35° for the selected subject). The braid has the characteristic of reducing in length and increasing in diameter when pressurized, due to the well known relationship between radial and longitudinal stresses. The finger acts against the finger cap in order to straighten out the finger, thus producing a self adjusting mechanism. The braid has a secondary advantage of being flexible due to its loose weave, thus offering the possibility of a low torque joint. Fig.3 Restraint. The design of the finger braid was made according to the following process: . measurement of the human finger: . maximum diameter, Dh . length, LI . selection of braid parameters: . construction diameter, Db . Db&gt;Dh for case of don/doff . construction angle, @0 . unprcssurizcd length, LO . Iterate on LO values up to Lpressurized = Lh and Dpressurize = Dh with @ &lt; 54°. . @0 and LO to be compatible with @ pressurized and donned &lt; 54° for shrink load effect. . LO and Db to be compatible with donning length elongation, (LOcLh), and donning reduction. 828</page><page sequence="4">Therefore a computer iteration was performed as follows: Measure of Dh Measure of LI ι @0 &lt;È&gt; When D = Dh Ν. ^^^5° (mobility) &lt; @=@1&lt;50° (shrink load) ^YES^ τ I LO τ When @=@ 1 &amp; D=DliS. L= Lh? ZyeTX LO.@0,EX) identified Fig.4 Flowchart of the finger braid computer iteration. Braid parameters like diameter, construction angle, yarn count, and unpressurized length must be optimized during the iterative development process; because the above flow chart describes design rules taking into account the shrinkage effect under pressure, but not the mobility aspect that can only be evaluated on the fabricated model. The shrink load effect is higher when @ is low, but the mobility is better as @ approaches 90°, (easier extension of the elongation area of the joint); therefore, a compromise is necessary. Table 1 shows the results of a computation made for @ for the design of the N° 5 finger braid of the phase CI subject: @0=60° D0= 25mm L0=37mm Ll=60.6mm Dh= 16.6mm Pres sur e=500 hpa Diameter 25 23.6 22.1 20.4 18.6 16.6 14.4 (mm) @ (degrees) 60 55 50 45 40 25 30 Length (mm) 37 42.4 47.6 52.3 56.7 60.6 64.1 % variation 14.7 28.6 41.4 53.2 63.8 73.2 on L0 % variation -5.4 -11.5 -18.4 -25.8 -33.8 -42.3 on DO Shrink load 1.2 2.8 4.1 5.2 6.0 6.4 6.4 (N) delta on L 0 5.4 10.6 15.3 19.7 23.6 27.1 (mm) delta on D 0 -1.4 -2.9 -4.6 -6.4 -8.4 -10.6 (mm) Table 1. Design of the fifth finger braid. For donning ease and fabrication feasibility, (D&gt;=25mm), the braid diameter is set at 25mm. Then a first series of iterations on @ values gives a 16.6mm diameter with a starting @ of 60° selected as a maximum acceptable angle with respect to ease of manufacturing. A high @ at 16.6mm is desired for good mobility, but this @ must remain under 54° in order to yield the required shrink load. The 35° angle for @ at 16.6mm is acceptable with @0 = 60°. Therefore, this first series of iterations has identified @0. It is now necessary to perform a new series of iterations on LO in order to ascertain L=60.6 at @=35° and D= 16.6mm. The computation yields a value of L0=37mm. This value corresponds to the active length of the braid for a 25mm diameter. The fabrication length of the braid is calculated as follows: . add 5 mm for the stitching allowance that is impregnated for the assembly to the finger cap. . subtract 10 due to the TMP glove interface protrusion with respect to the measurement of L. . subtract the length of the Kevlar finger caps that closes the braid, (LKevlar). Thus: Lfabrication= L-10+5-LKevlar= L-LKevlar - 5 Both ends are impregnated with polyurethane on a 5mm length corresponding to the stitching allowance. The finger caps are fabricated from a knitted Kevlar. Their size is measured from the subjects hand and correlated by measurements taken from plaster moulds of the hand. They are impregnated with polyurethane in order to block the threads. They are bonded and stitched to the finger braids. The function of the palm control system, (PCS), is to control the restraint ballooning in the palm area of the glove due to the adverse diameter/pressure ratio effect. The control of 829</page><page sequence="5">ihis ballooning is considered as critical, it is a main driver to the reduction in grasp performance. The PCS is based upon a segmented plate concept. This plate is designed to resist the glove pressure in one direction, but bend, (thus providing flexibility), in the other. The plate was constructed from a Kevlar plate with cut epoxy blocks bonded onto its surface, (ref Fig. 4). u fiQ . SECT i ON AA ^ ļo^. it*œ :'Tļ|ī ' (7) '= ' (7) V J '= SUPPORT V J Λ irtmnu Fig.4 Palm Control System. This assembly was subsequently enveloped in a polyester case in order to reduce the possibility of restraint pinching by the epoxy blocks. Adjustment straps made from high tenacity polyethylene were subsequently attached. As a modification to the PCS, a curved stainless steel bar was added to the plate in an attempt to enhance the PCS performance. The thumb metacarpal joint designed for the phase CI EVA glove was based upon a flat pattern joint with dual plane helical axial restraints, thus giving the required omnidirectional joint. This joint is also considered as a critical clement in the development of the EVA glove, as it has a high effect upon the performance of the glove, as hand manipulation consists of a combination of grasping and finger/thumb opposition movements. The wrist joint is essentially a three degree of freedom joint. The glove accommodates for the abduction/adduction and flexion/extension motions and the pro/supination requirement is fulfilled by the wrist bearing. The phase CI wrist design was based upon a tucked joint using a metallic gimbal ring to give the transmission between a flexion/extension joint and an abduction/adduction joint; and to transmit the axial plug and man loads. The transmission of these loads is via the axial restraints which are stitched to the restraint on the hand side and connected to the wrist disconnect by redundant "dog bone" brackets. Their attachment to the gimbal ring is via attachment brackets. The wrist side axial restraints are backed up by secondary restraints running around the gimbal ring and attaching to the "dog bones". The main restraint body, constructed from polyester, forms the base onto which the other elements of the restraint are attached. It also incorporates the flange assembly that allows for the eventual integration to the wrist disconnect. The volume of the restraint body is designed to be the same as the hand volume; with elongation allowances. The design of the restraint body gores was made using a CAD model of the hand. The subjects hand mould was digitize, and the database loaded into the CAD system (CATIA RS6000). Note; the glove is designed in the relaxed hand position. From this database, a model of the hand surface was made and the restraint body gore design performed. The subsequent templates were printed directly from the CATIA system, and the patterns made. Axial restraints are stitched to the restraint body and run around the finger crotches. They transmit loads into the gimbal ring. TMP - The TMP glove, (ref Fig. 5), was based upon the US and Soviet solutions. This was done as it was not possible to perform 100% thermal calculations due to the aspect of insulation required, (conductive on palm, radiative on back), combined with the stringent mobility/dexterity requirements. The approach, then, was to build the TMP glove breadboard and to test in order to attain data for a iterative re-design. The TMP glove can itself be split into three elements: . Palm. . Hand back and Wrist. . Finger Caps. The inner palm was essentially made from a polybenzimidazolc, (PBI), twill with an outer coating of RTV silicone. The silicone is arranged in patterns in order to cause a discontinuity of the cross-section of the thermal membrane, and thus enhance mobility. The inner surface of the palm is a layer of Teflon fabric. There are two layers of multi-layer insulation, (MLI), between the PBI and the Teflon. One layer of MLI consists of a sheet of aluminized Mylar and a polyester net spacer. Hence, the layers of aluminized Mylar are interspaced with polyester net. Fig.5 TMP. The hand back and wrist of the TMP glove are of a sandwich construction. The inner and outer layers are of Teflon, with three layers of MLI sandwiched between. These layers are arranged in tucked joints on the back of the fingers and thumb in order to provide for a one degree of freedom 830</page><page sequence="6">joint. The dimensional calculation of these tucked fingers was made from the CATIA model and from the plaster hand moulds of the subject. Provision is made for the adjustment of the PCS strap by a hinged window in the back of the hand, restrained by a Velcro strip. The fingers caps of the TMP glove represent one of the main challenges of the TMP glove design. They are designed to give the required touch temperature protection, whilst offering an acceptable level of tactile perception. The assembly of the TMP glove finger caps with the finger body is of great importance, as this joint is in the area of the receptive distal phalanges. COMFORT GLOVE - Although not studied during the phase CI activities, comfort gloves shall almost certainly be required by crew members, (based upon US and Soviet experience). The comfort glove is considered to serve two main functions: . To provide hand comfort via the boundary of the comfort glove; ie, forming an interface between potential hard points and the hand. . Removing perspiration produced by the hand during high metabolic rate periods; and transfering to the wrist area to be removed and processed by the oxygen ventilation network tubes. The comfort glove would need to be of thin material capable of the required moisture transmission, such as polypropylene. Finger tips would not be covered due to the tactile perception requirements. PERFORMANCE TESTING In order to evaluate not only the effects of the EVA glove on hand functioning, but also the effects of the TMP glove on hand performances, each test procedure was repeated in the three following experimental conditions: . Bare-hand, . EVA glove including the three basic layers which we shall call in this study GLOVE 1, . EVA glove without the TMP glove which we shall call in this study GLOVE 2. All the tests with the gloves were performed at a differential pressure of 500hPa. The motor performances of the hand in its natural state were compared to the scores of the hand wearing GLOVE 1 and GLOVE 2. The glove effects were expressed for each variable in % difference from bare-hand performance: delta % = [(GLO VE/H AND)P- 1 ] * 1 00 where, ρ = 1 when the performance improves with the variable amplitude, p= -1 when the performance regresses with the variable amplitude. Each individual test had its own set of variables (ref Table 3). The analysis and presentation of the test results were organized by the individual test. This standardization of data allowed comparisons across dependent variables and across the tests within each hand capability domain so that general conclusions could be derived. TEST EQUIPMENT - Glove testing was conducted in the Glove Test Laboratory at AERAZUR, Issy-les-Moulineaux, Paris, France, (ref Fig. 6). The following equipment was used for the EVA glove testing: . Glove Box, . Digital pinch/grip analyzer (MIE, UK) . Pronation/supination torque meter. . Active two-edge discrimination device. . Object identification carrousel. . Grip Force perception analyzer. . Signal Conditioner. . Intelligent peripheral, (CED 1401, UK). . "Perdue Pegboard" (Lafayette Instrument Company, USA) . "O'Connor Pegboard" (Lafayette Instrument Company, USA) . Compaq computer, type Deskpro 386/20e Model 40. Fig.6 Glove Test Laboratory. THE GLOVE BOX - The Glove Box used in this study was a chamber made of Plexiglass, cylindrical in shape, with a working section of 0.7 m in diameter and 1 m in length. When the desired pressure differential was established the outer surface of the glove was at less than one atmosphere; the inside of the glove (containing the hand) was at one atmosphere. The two end caps of the glove box were installed with O rings and were hinged to the main body of the glove box to form doors that could be opened for access to the interior of the glove box. This facilitated the disposition of the test equipment within the glove box and die attachment of the glove itself. Two 0.26 m circular openings have been made in the cylinder wall, placed shoulder width apart in order to provide the access and attachment points for the EVA glove and arm assemblies. For the testing, a Phase CI standard elbow joint was used to make the interface between the glove and the glove box. The elbow joint was mounted upon a bearing which was located in the appropriate port. Sealing was achieved by an internal seal in the bearing. The bearing allows for rotation of the elbow joint and hence greatly enhances the testing facility. 831</page><page sequence="7">PERFORMANCE DESIGNATED UNITS ABBREVIATIONS PARAMETER DEPENDANT VARIABLES Mobility in Maximal pronation mobility of the wrist.

Performance Tests and Variables. By means of the glove port plugs, the Glove Box was designed to allow the use of one or both arm assemblies. In this study all the tests were achieved with one hand. The other parts of the Glove Box included a regulator/safety valve, pressure control valve, and lab. facility vacuum pump. The testing devices were placed on an electrically controlled moving table inside the Glove Box. This table permited the devices to be moved in the Χ, Y and Ζ axes for fine adjustment in order to achieve an optimum and comfortable position before each test THE SUBJECT - The phase CI efforts were concentrated upon one subject, (the glove being made to measure). The subject was a Caucasian male aged 33 years. Prior to testing, the subject was briefed on the purpose of the study and the test methods being used. The test experiments were demonstrated by the test conductor and the test subject was allowed to become familiar with the glove under pressure by trying the glove in the Glove Box. Tests were sequenced to minimize fatigue and boredom effects. One or two trials were systematically undertaken in each test to familiarize the subject with the machine. TEST RESULTS - Mobility and Torque in Pronation and Supination - For pronation/supination mobility measurements, the subject was asked to grip a "D" handle (ref Fig. 7) with his right hand and then turn it counterclockwise/clockwise, to maximum extent possible. The computer program recorded mobility/torque every 0.04 seconds for a total time of 3 seconds. The mobility/torque versus time curve thus produced was graphically displayed on the monitor and the maximum is automatically searched. If it is necessary, the experimenter can modify manually the selection of the maximum before saving the result on the floppy disk. This procedure is repeated three times. For each variable, the means of the three trials are computed and saved on the floppy disk. Variables (ref table 2), . MBP Maximal Pronation Mobility of the Wrist .

Reductions in R.O.M. from bare-hand to glove/pressurized hand are between 12% and 23%. The degradation in torque performances are between 17% and 55%. It is important to note the major drop for the pronation torque (CAP) particularly with GLOVE 1. This movement is often used, for example to loosen a screw. The subject reported that he was unable to utilize finger five, (little finger) during R.O.M. and torques pro/supination measurements, since the glove exhibited excessive palm ballooning. Fig.7 Pronation/Supination Evaluation. Strength - The Digital Pinch/Grip Analyzer developed by MIE medical research was used for strength evaluations, (ref Fig.8). The device consists of two cushioned aluminium bars approximately six inches long. The separation between the two handles is adjustable to suit any hand size and the design allows for measurement of finger pinch and hand grip strength. In this experiment with this subject, the handle span was set at 2.5 cm. A supporting handle had been constructed that held the dynamometer on the table top inside the Glove Box, but did not firmly attach it; the dynamometer remained freely movable thanks to a spring system. The Pinch/Grip Analyzer was interfaced with the computer for detailed analysis. Two types of measurement were performed: . the pinch/grip maximum strength . the pinch/grip muscle endurance For the measurement of pinch/grip maximum strength, the subject was asked to grip the bar as fast and as hard as possible after the signal and to hold the grip until the signal for release is given ten seconds later. The computer program records force in Newtons every 0.04 seconds for a total time of 15 seconds. The grip versus time curve thus produced is graphically displayed on the monitor, (ref Fig.9). Fig.8, Digital Grip/Pinch Analyser The curve is mathematically described by the following parameters: . maximum grip strength in Newton (MGS), . time to maximum value in seconds (tmax), . grip strength at release (FGS), . rate of loss of grip from maximum value to the point of release of grip/pinch (described as fatigue rate), expressed in % per second, Fatigue Index = (MGS-FGS)*100/MGS*ti Where, . ti is the time between MGS and FGS, MGS and FGS is automatically searched by the computer. If it is necessary, the experimenter can modify manually the selection of MGS and FGS before saving the result on the floppy disk. This procedure is repeated three times. For each variable, the means of the three trials are computed and saved on the floppy disk. For the measurement of pinch/grip muscle endurance, the subject is asked to grip or pinch the handle for as long as possible at a level equal to 75% of his maximum strength 834</page><page sequence="10">previously determined. The computer displays a bar graph of the grip/pinch strength and selects a 75% maximum level. The subject must squeeze the handles, maintaining the bar graph at the 75% value zone until fatigue causes the subject to release the handle. On release of the handles the program computes the impulse which can be considered as a fatigue index. Fig.9 Hand grip strength versus lime curves. For both maximum and endurance tests, power grip and key pinch are measured. For tip, and palmar pinch the maximum strength only is performed. Variables(ref table 2), . FAM Maximum power grip strength . FAT Time to maximum power grip strength . FAF Fatigue Index for power grip . FAI Impulse for power grip . FBM Maximum tip pinch . FBT Time to maximum tip pinch . FBF Fatigue Index for tip pinch . FCM Maximum key pinch FCT Time to maximum key pinch . FCF Fatigue index for key pinch . FCI Impulse for key pinch . FDM Maximum palmar pinch . FDT Time to maximum palmar pinch . FDF Fatigue index for palmar pinch Results are shown in Table 3. Degradation of strength from bare-hand to glove/pressurized hand was significant. Percentage grip and pinch maximum strength (FAM, FCM, FDM) loss due to gloves comprised of between 30% and 74%. Looking at tip pinch hand motions, a different result was obtained since both glove conditions produced an increase of more than 20 % for the maximal lip strength (FBM). This finding was consistent with other glove research indicating that the glove can improve some finger strength measures (O'Hara et al, 1989). The major decrease for impulsion (up to 79%) when wearing gloves indicates that fatigue is serious and occurs very fast. Concerning time to maximum grip/pinch strength (FAT, FBT, FCT, FDT), it appears that this time is systematically longer when wearing GLOVE 1. This is probably due to the stiffness of the TMP garment. It is surprising that when removing the TMP garment. the time to maximum strength is respectively 19% and 14% shorter than bare-hand for tip and key pinch. Further research is necessary to confirm this finding. Looking at the fatigue index results (FAF, FBF, FCF, FDF), one can observe that drops were between 15% and 52% (ref table 3) indicating that the subject could hardly hold the maximum level of his strength both for power grip and precision pinches. It is also important to mention that the key pinch scores were generally better when the subject wore GLOVE 1. During the experiment the subject declared that key pinch was definitely uncomfortable when wearing both gloves. Pain was felt at the carpometacarpal joints of thumb and forefinger. Better scores with GLOVE 1 could be explained by the impression, reported by the subject, that the TMP garment retains pressure. Therefore fatigue and discomfort are reduced which improve performance. Tactile Percention - KANTOWITZ and SORKIN (1983) made an important distinction between two aspects of tactile sensitivity: . passive touch . active touch Passive touch is the impinging of mechanical stimulation onto the body, and is the sensory modality most usually studied. Active touch is the active exploration of an object or a surface with a subject's skin and hence is much closer to tactile inspection than is passive touch. The three tests described hereafter used to evaluate tactile perception were investigating active touch. Active Two-Edge Discrimination - In this experiment, the subject is required to slide the tip of the index finger over two straight edges which can be separated from 0 to 15 mm, (ref Fig. 10). Six different spans were selected at the beginning of the experiment and each span was felt 10 times, with the middle of the distal phalange of the index finger. The spans were presented in a random order. The subject responded on a two-point scale; either "one edge" or "two edges".

Variable (ref table 2), . TAS Detection threshold or 50% probability-of- detection i.e,the span which permits the detection of two edges with a 0.5 probability. The number of times the subject detects two edges was recorded for each span. The results were divided by the total number of presentations for each span (ten in this experiment) in order to compute the probability of detection. The psychophysical functions (spans versus detection probability) computed for the three experimental conditions are shown in Fig.l 1. The functions are of the expected S-shape. The effect of glove types is shown as the threshold or 50% probability-of-detection point, determined from the psychophysical functions of each experimental conditions. It is very interesting to observe that the threshold is quite the same for bare-hand and GLOVE 2, respectively 2.93 mm and 2.99 mm; and that the TMP garment produces a significant decrement (55%) in the ability of discriminating two edges. Grip Force Perception - Active touch was also explored using the methodology developed by Westling and Johansson^). The task consisted of picking up the dynamometer (ref fig. 12) employing a comfortable grip force, holding it for ten seconds, and then gradually reducing the applied grip force until slippage occurs. A vertical force gauge detects slippage. Then the grip force at the time corresponding to slippage is calculated as the minimal grip force to prevent slippage. This force is called slip force. The difference between sustaining grip force and slippage grip force is reported as the safety index (TBS). The test was repeated 6 times with 3 different weights (rcf table 3). Variables (ref table 2), . TBS Safety Index. . TBF Friction Index. . TBG Mean grip force The results of this experiment are displayed in Fig. 13. We were surprised to observe that concerning the safety index (TBS), the subject had better scores with both gloves. Performance were improved by 221% and 118% respectively for GLOVE 1 and GLOVE 2, when compared to the bare-hand (ref table 3). Fig. 12 Grip Force Perception Analyzer. The friction index shows that GLOVE 2 was much more slippery than GLOVE 1 (54%). This may be due to the presence of the silicone coating at different places on the palmar surface of the TMP garment which enhanced the grip capability. 836</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 13 Relationship between grip force perception and loads It appears also that the mean grip force (TBG) for the 18 trials (3 weights presented 6 times) is the same when comparing bare-hand (41.4 ± 10.68 N) to GLOVE 1 (41.7 ±10.44 N). Removing the TMP glove induced a severe increase in TBG which attained a mean value of 1 15.9 ±22.35 Ν (ref table 3). These results suggest that the subject tends to hold objects with excessive force when wearing GLOVE 2. This can be explain by the slipperiness of GLOVE 2. It is also important to mention that the subject had been restricted by the palm restraint when he had to lift up the dynamometer. Object Identification - Fig. 14 shows the equipment set-up for the object identification tests. This test was performed with sets of objects of four basic shapes (sphere, cylinder, cube, rectangular parallelepiped) over a range of three sizes (small, medium and large). The subject was required to identify the object shape by manipulation without seeing it and then selecting his perceived choice on a keyboard. His object identification via the keyboard was relayed directly into the computer through the serial port. After identification, the carrousel was rotated in order to bring the next object in line with his hand. Number of objects correctly identified and time necessary for identification were recorded. Variables (ref table 2), . TCN Number of objects correctly identified TCT T0tai t¡me of identification After training bare-hand, the subject was able to identify the 120 objects presented (12 objects - 10 presentations) and the overall mean time of identification (TCT) was 2.8 ±0.62s. When the subject wore GLOVE 1 (with TMP garment), we observed for TCN and TCT a decrement of 56.7% and 85.6% respectively since the number of objects correctly identified was 52 and the overall mean time of identification was 19.40 ±9.37s. Percent loss due to GLOVE 2 was less significant. The number of objects correctly identified was 106 (-11.7%) and the overall mean time of identification was 8.5 ±4.28 s (- 67.2 %). These results arc confirmed by statistical analysis (two- factor ANO V A's with repeated measures). Moreover this analysis shows also that the shape of the object had no influence on the number of objects correctly identified and the time of identification. However the size of the objects had a significant influence on the time of identification (F= 8.5 , ρ &lt; 0.01); small objects required the greatest time for identification. The glove effect is equally influenced by the size of the objects as the interaction between factors is highly significant (F =6,41 , p&lt; 0.002). The above mentioned effect had not been observed with respect to the shape of the objects. Dexterity - Purdue Pegboard Test - Right Hand Test: The subject was instructed to pick up one pin at a time with the right hand from a tray of pins and place each pin in a hole, starting at the left top corner. The subject was allowed exactly 30 seconds to put in as many pins as possible with the right hand. The Right Hand score was the total number of pins the subject placed with the right hand. Assembly Test: (rcf Fig. 15). This sequence tested more minute finger dexterity and consisted of assembling the pins, collars, and washers. Normally this test is performed with two hands. Since only one hand was introduced in the Glove Box, we modi fed the normal procedure of the assembly test by asking the subject to perform it only with the right hand. The score of the assembly test is the number of parts assembled during the one minute of testing time. If for example eight 837</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 14 Object Identification Set-up. complete assemblies are made, the score is therefore 32, since each assembly consists of four parts. If six complete assemblies are made and the pin and first washer of the seventh assembly are properly placed at the end of the minute, the score is 26. This method of scoring is simpler than using the number of complete assemblies because it eliminates the necessity of using quarters of an assembly in determining the score. Fig. 15 Assembly Test. O'Connor Finger Dexterity Test - The O'Connor Finger Dexterity Test is a single-handed test. The subject was required to pick up three small pins at a time from a tray of pins with the right hand and place them three at a time in a small hole. He had to fill a series of small holes in this manner as fast as possible. Score was the total number of pins the subject places with the right hand during one minute. Dexterity - O'Connor Tweezers Dexterity Test - This was the same apparatus as for the O'Connor Finger Dexterity Test but the subject was required to manipulate the pins with a tweezers. The subject is required to pick up one pin at a time from a tray of pins with the tweezers hold in the right hand. Then he must place the pin in a small hole beginning with the left top corner, (ref Fig. 16). Fig. 16 O'Connor Tweezers Test. 838</page><page sequence="14">Score is the total number of pins the subject places with the tweezers during one minute. Variables (ref table 2), . DAH The Right Hand Purdue Pegboard Score . DAA The Assembly Purdue Pegboard Score . DAF The O'Connor Finger Dexterity Score . DAT The O'Connor Tweezers Dexterity Score A series of practice sessions were conducted for each test. During the practice, the subject tried a few rows, bare-handed and untimed. Then the timed sessions began. TIFFIN^) reported that three-trial administration, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82 to 0.91, was more reliable than one-trial administration, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.60 to 0.79. Consequently a total of three trials were administered to each subject for each test. By alternating between the dexterity tests, a control for learning effects and boredom can be achieved. Therefore, in each of the three experimental conditions, the subject was tested in the following order : . practice and replicate 1 of Purdue Pegboard-Right Hand (PPRH) . practice and replicate 1 of Purdue Pegboard- Assembly (PPA) . replicate 2 of PPRH . replicate 2 of PPA . replicate 3 of PPRH . replicate 3 of PPA Then, . practice and replicate 1 of O'Connor Finger Dexterity (OFD) . practice and replicate 1 of O'Connor Tweezers dexterity (OTD) . replicate 2 of OFD . replicate 2 of OTD . replicate 3 of OFD . replicate 3 of OTD The results of the dexterity tests were consistent. Both GLOVES 1 and 2 reduced dexterity performance by approximately 90% (ref table 3). The dexterity tests were considered to be one of the more severe, and at the same time sensitive, means of glove performance evaluation. Although the dexterity tests do highlight certain specific design aspects of the glove, it may also be considered as a reasonably "systems" level test giving a good overall view of glove performance. General Observations - The subject expressed pain at the following locations: . On the outer surface of the second carpometacarpal joint, (CMJ2). . On the outer side of CMJ2-5. . At the wrist end of the radius and ulna, (interference of gimbal ring and bladder fabric). The subject had difficulty with the donning of the glove due to the surface texture of the latex bladder being of an "adhesive" nature. Problems were encountered with the braided fingers which were found to be fragile with continuous use. "Windowing" was observed in the restraint stitching. THERMAL TESTING The thermal testing of the glove were, due to the budgetary constraints, originally planned to be performed unpressurized. However, following an offer from the ILC Dover company, of Delaware, North America; the EVA glove was fitted to a shuttle EMU and tested under a nominal suit pressure of 4.3 psi, (296hpa). This was considered to be a significant enhancement to the testing, as the pressurized glove would be in a more operational state, (ref Fig.17 and 18). EQUIPMENT- The following equipment was used for the thermal testing: . Cold bar. Comprising a 5cm diameter bar, through which liquid nitrogen was passed. The surface temperature was monitored via thermocouples and the temperature controlled by a flow control valve. . Hot plate. Comprising an electrically heated and controlled plate, (60cm χ 45cm); control being via thermocouples on the surface of the plate. The plate was itself mounted upon a balance in order to monitor and control the touch pressure . A control panel, being the support instrumentation and data acquisition equipment. . A shuttle EMU. The design test subject was not used during the thermal testing due to administrative problems. A survey of candidate ILC Dover personnel was conducted to find a suitable hand size. The selected person was an ILC Dover design engineer. COLD TESTS - The cold tests were performed in two modes: . 30 second endurance. . Maximum endurance. 30 second Duration - In this test, the subject gripped the cold bar and subjectively repeated his force on the bar. The subject maintained contact for 30 seconds, or until the subject felt discomfort. Pass/fail criteria: . Thermal protection: the skin temperature of the subjects hand ,ie any thermocouple reading, shall not fall below 10°C. . Bladder integrity: visual inspection and leak test shall reveal no signs of degradation. Maximum Duration - In this test the subject gripped the dynomometer calibrated at the grip load and subjectively repeated his force on the cold bar. The subject was to maintain contact with the bar until he sensed discomfort, or until the skin temperature fell below 10°C. Pass/fail criteria: . Thermal protection: the skin temperature of the subjects hand , ie any thermocouple reading, shall not fall below 10°C. . Bladder integrity: visual inspection and leak test shall reveal no signs of degradation. 839</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 17 Cold Tests. HOT TESTS - The hot tests were performed in four modes: . 30 second duration, hand flat on plate. . 30 second duration, thumb and palm placed on plate. . 30 second duration, finger tips placed on plate. . Maximum duration, hand flat on plate. 30 Second Duration, flat hand - bi this test the subject placed his entire hand inner surface on the hot plate with a force of 0.5daN. The subject maintained contact for 30 seconds, or until he sensed discomfort. Pass/fail criteria: .

During the maximum duration cold test, the subject experienced coldness and slight pain on the index finger at 63 seconds. At release of bar after 157 seconds, the subject felt minor pain and a coolness over the whole hand. An inspection of the glove showed no signs of deterioration. During the 30 second hot tests, the subject did not mark any particular pain, only a general warmth over the whole hand. During the maximum duration hot test, the subject felt most of the heat at the finger tips of fingers 2, 3 and 4; and the side of the thumb. At glove release after 300 seconds, the subject felt pain at the tips of fingers 2 and 3. An inspection of the glove after testing showed a light brown discoloration of the bladder over the palm area. SOVIET TESTING As a compliment to the above testing, a short test programme was carried out at ZVEZDA, Moscow, formally USSR. This programme consisted of comparitive tests between the Hermes EVA Glove BB and the Soviet Orlan DMA glove. All tests were performed at 0, 250, 400 and 500hpa, with the glove interfaced to a Orlan DMA Suit, (ref Fig.20). Fig.20 Soviet Tests. The following parameters were evaluated, with between 1 1 and 15 subjects: . Maximum grip and fatigue, . Range of motion, . Key pinch and fatigue, . Ball pinch, . Rod pull test. The test results for the wrist bending moments are shown hereafter (figs.21 &amp; 22). Fig.21 Hermes EVA Glove Wrist Bending Moments. Fig.22 Orlan-DMA EVA Glove Wrist Bending Moments. DISCUSSION The ideal space suit glove would provide unrestricted hand motion and minimize the work required to manipulate the glove. The glove would be comfortable to wear and provide tactility and dexterity comparable to the hand alone. These design goals will probably never be fully attained since the pressure internal to the glove and the design measures taken to contain the pressure loading tend to stiffen the glove and thus causes a significant diminution of hand performances. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce a "large" number of variables to a smaller number of factors without losing too much information. We have carried out a PCA (Q-technique) of the variables bare-hand, GLOVE 1 and GLOVE 2. The results of this analysis are summarized in Fig.23. The PCA will be particularly interesting in the future when several types of gloves will have to be examined across a large set of parameters. 842</page><page sequence="18">FACTOR 1 -1 o .1 «" 9 GLOVE t 1 ' ; TBS ' i oTBG w ' : FBF FBM ο ' : ! °ofC FBF F FBM ' ! °TBF '■ ' Ś o MBS &lt;n ' : 0fcm oj 1 'i oFCI oj z¿ !

There are three important principles that must be considered in order to understand factor analysis: . A large number of variables can be resolved into a smaller number of reference vectors known as factors. . The loadings of variables on factors express the correlations between the variables and the factors. In this sense the higher the loading a variable has on a factor, the better the description of the variable by the factor. . Different variables will load differently on different factors. The idea behind PCA is to extract factors, sequentially, such that the first factor (Fl) accounts for the maximum common factor variance across all the variables (i.e. more than any other factor that could be extracted). In PCA a second factor (reference vector - F2) is then extracted which is at right angles to the first factor (i.e. orthogonal to it) such that it extracts the maximum amount of the common factor variance that remains. A third factor is then constructed, again at right angles, and so on, until all the common factor variance has been extracted. In the language of factor analysis, the correlation between a variable and a factor is known as the loading of the variable on the factor. For example in Fig.23, the loading of bare-hand on Factor 1 is 0.956. The percentage of variance extracted by Fl and F2 are respectively 52.3% and 47.7%. Percentage variance is a useful statistic because it gives a clear idea of the contribution of the factors to the total variance. In our analysis, it appears that the first two factors account for 100% of the total variance. Factor 1 describes essentially the difference between bare- hand and GLOVE 2 and Factor 2 illustrates essentially the difference between the two gloves. The variables located on Fig.23 between bare-hand and GLOVE 2 have poor scores when the subject wears the glove with the TMP glove (GLOVE 1). Thus it can be concluded by observing this Figure that TMP glove impaired severely active touch (TAS, TCT, TCN) and flexibility of the fingers (FBT, FCT, FDT). It is also interesting to note that concerning pro/supination, torques (CAP, CAS) were greater with the TMP glove (GLOVE 1) but mobility (MBP, MBS) were small with this glove. Concerning GLOVE 2, it can be concluded from Fig.23 that the subject had less performance when using a key pinch (FCF, FCM, FCI) except for the time to maximum key pinch (FCT) which could be explained by the stiffness of the TMP glove. With GLOVE 2 it can also be observed that the subject tended to grip objects with too much force (TBG) . One can also observe that GLOVE 1 is less slippery than GLOVE 2 since the friction index (TBF) is greater. Figure 23 shows also that FBM and TBS are the only variables which performances improve when wearing indifferently both gloves. This first effect may be explained by the spring effect induced when one opens the fingers to perform a pinch action. Power grip (FAM, FAI), palmar pinch (FDM) and dexterity capacity (DAH, DAA, DAF, DAT) are severely reduced by putting on both gloves. 843</page><page sequence="19">performance tesť dependant PRIMARY glove secondary glove PARAMETER VARIABLES SYSTEM INPUTS SYSTEM INPUTS Mobility ROM Wrist Pro/supinotion MBP.

The most important conclusions to be derived from these results is that TMP glove causes a very large degradation in tactile perception and flexibility of the fingers. The tactile perception of the fingers was not in fact impaired by an over thick finger cap, but by a badly placed finger cap/finger joining seam. These seams were located around the middle position of the distal phalange of the fingers where there is a high population of mechanoreceptive afferent units. Thus the seams created a tactile barrier with the subsequent severe reduction in tactility. This same poor positioning of finger cap seams had also adversely effected the dexterity of the glove, as they were placed in the position of object dextile grasping. However, the seams cannot be wholly held responsible for the large reduction in dexterity. The finger sizing was not optimum for the subject; the fingers being too long, particularly for the thermal glove. This manifested itself as excess material at some of the finger ends. Following Lederman's (1978) finding that the shear force at the skin is a determiner of tactile sensitivity it is important to conceive the glove bearing that in mind. Hand performances and the user comfort could also be greatly improved by revising the structural components or exoskeleton used to prevent palm bulge. Restriction of motions, reduction of strength tactility, dexterity and considerable discomfort result from this inoptimum design. Since the effects of the glove can be broken into two 844</page><page sequence="20">components, the glove itself and its operating pressure, it should be interesting to evaluate the relative contributions of both components by performing the tests at different pressures. For example it could be interesting to perform the tests with two pressure levels of 300 hPa and 500 hPa. During both the 30 second cold test and the maximum duration cold test, the greatest decrease in skin temperature was observed at the finger tips of the index and middle fingers; the index being the largest of the two. This was confirmed by the pain felt at the tip of the index finger. However, it is felt that the stand-offs offered by the finger tip seams, were significant in insulating the finger tips. A cold sink effect of between 60 and 120 seconds was also observed and may be regarded as important. During the 30 second hot tests, the most receptive thermocouples were those placed on the base of the thumb and the tips of the index and middle fingers. However, once prolonged contact is made, an approximately linear increase in skin temperature occurred at all thermocouple positions. As for the cold test, an important heat sink effect was observed. For both tests, the insulating stand-offs afforded by the silicone dimples were seen to be effective, apart from the area around the thumb metacarpal joint which was not protected by silicone. Finally; in an attempt to make a liaison between the test data and the glove design, the following matrix has been constructed in order to identify the test/glove element paths. Through this matrix, (Fig. 24), the glove design features effecting the test results are identified; being either primary or secondary inputs. CONCLUSIONS It should be remembered that the glove tests were performed not only to evaluate the performance of the glove, but also to generate data upon which design decisions and hence changes can be made. Thus from the above discussion it is necessary to assimilate the various ideas and highlights, and to draw conclusions; both of a general nature and specific to areas of the glove design. In this way this series of tests will serve as the first iterative input into the EVA glove breadboard. Therefore, we may elicit the following conclusions from this study: . The test methodology developed during this programme was both sensitive and discriminating in the range performance analyzed; bare-hand to pressurized gloved-hand. . Performance in each capability domain were affected by both gloves. . The results across tests within each capability domain correlated very well, thus providing confidence in the reliability of the test methodology. . The two largest contributors to glove performance reduction were the palm plate and the TMP glove. . Wrist pronation and supination torques need to be reduced. . Wrist comfort was poor. . Palm ballooning was critical, and was a major contributor to the performance reduction of the glove. Thus, this system needs to be improved. . Finger bulk, (TMP), and palm plate had a significant effect on dexterity. . The subject had a better ability to identify the size of objects that their shape. . The TMP glove had a significant effect upon tactile perception. . The thermal glove met the requirements of the hot and cold test. . During both hot and cold tests, discomfort was felt in the area around the thumb metacarpal joint, which was not covered with silicone, (thus this covering of silicone needs to be optimized in terms of its position). . A cold sink and hot sink effect occurred after the subject had removed his hand from the source. This will need to be taken into consideration in future specifications. . The dimpled silicone acted as an efficient "stand-off during the thermal testing. . The finger tips were protected by the stand-offs afforded by the finger cap/finger joints; this being a situation not desirable from a physiological performance viewpoint. The above conclusions are of a critical nature, as it is the intention to identify the areas that need to be improved. It should, however, be noted that it was possible to perform all the test tasks with the glove; that had not received any iterative modifications and was tested straight from build. RECOMMENDATIONS The following recommendations may be made from the information yielded by this initial series of tests in order to significantly improve glove performance: . Wrist torque to be reduced. . Bladder form at wrist should conform to that of restraint. . Bladder material should be changed to be less "adhesive" (polyurethane or viton). . Restraint finger sizing to be incorporated. . Palm ballooning control system to be improved. . Gimbal ring size/form to be re- worked. . Finger crotch positions to be further optimized, particularly finger 5. . TMP glove sizing to be improved. . TMP glove finger bulk to be reduced, particularly between finger seams. . TMP glove finger caps to be better sized, with an optimization of seam position and size. . Cycling tests to be performed in lieu of signs of early wear. . The test programme should be supplemented with "mission" related tasks in the glove box. . This test campaign has yielded a large amount of design data that will serve as an invaluable tool in the design evolution of the EVA glove. The next step must be to implement the modifications, perform another series of tests and to evaluate the performance change. . The thermal glove needs to be tested to asses its performance with respect to the micrometeroid/radiation requirements. - It should be feasible to reduce the layer build-up /concept /bulk of the TMP glove in order to increase its performance characteristics with respect to glove box testing, (again, refer to mechanical test report). . Further analysis should be carried out in order to understand the thermal map of the contact surface, and thus optimize the silicone positioning and thus aid with bulk reduction. 845</page><page sequence="21">It should be understood the present test programme was conceived as a design tool. However, this test programme will have to be enlarged in order to encompass life testing and mission related task evaluation. Hence the mission profile should enter into the design iteration loop. Finally; the experienced gained from the phase CI glove development programme has been significant. It is clear that the EVA glove is one, if not the, most critical elements of the 500hpa EVA suit. The result of the phase CI works has not been to produce an acceptably performing EVA glove. However, the consequence of these works has been to put in place the organization, confidence and know-how that can develop a satisfactory ŚOOhpa EVA glove within the framework of the Hermes specifications and schedules.
