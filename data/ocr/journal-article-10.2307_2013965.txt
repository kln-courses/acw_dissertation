<plain_text><page sequence="1">Essentials of Scientific Method. A. WoLp. New York: Macmillan Co. 1925. Pp. 157. In spite of the number of works upon scientific method which have recently appeared, there is still an urgent need for one which, while being intelligible to the less advanced student, is at the same time sufficiently analytic to warrant serious consideration. Broad, Cassirer, Whitehead, and Johnson, to name only a few, are highly significant in their contributions to the logic of scientific method, but they are quite obviously too difficult for the uninitiated layman. On the other hand, the authors of most of the elementary textbooks in logie, in their treatments of the inductive aspects of thinking, give a there surface analysis, and in their desire to maintain intel- ligibility, either avoid entirely some of the most fundamental prob- lems of scientific explanation, or else simply suggest such problems with little or no significant discussion. Professor Wolf's book, I must confess, lies in the second group. The most disappointing aspect of the book is its brevity. The complexity of the subject makes it impossible to present an adequate discussion in 160 pages, even by limiting one's treatment to the "elements." Without doubt most of what the author says is cor- rect, and there are moments suggestive of real insight. But in his acknowledged proposal to present a discussion of scientific method without the "encumbrances" of psychological and philosophical con- siderations, and especially in the satisfactory degree to which he has carried out his proposal, he has greatly lessened the value of what might originally have been a contribution to the field. The topics discussed are the usual ones: observation, analysis, imagination, analogy, classification, statistics, natural law, and prob- ability. What novelty the book possesses is due to the following: a discussion of the evolutionary and comparative methods, a restate- ment in less ambiguous terminology of Mill's methods, and a very suggestive chapter on scientific explanation. Professor Wolf's discussion of causation is apparently a justifica- tion for something analogous to the common-sense idea of cause "pro- ducing" effect. In our search for order in nature, he mai:ntains, we come upon certain uniformities, either of coexistence or of se- quence. It is one of the fundamental problems of science to deter- mine in which of these uniformities the facts or factors are "con- nected." The author defines a connected relation between two facts</page><page sequence="2">390 JO URNAL OF PHILOSOPHY as that which holds when "one of them is the condition of the other" (107). Furthermore, by a condition of anything is meant whatever is indispensable to that thing or event, etc., or that in the absence of which the thing will not be, or the event will not happen, or at least they will be different." Yet condition is not to be confused with cause, for "by the cause of an event or result is meant the minimum totality of conditions each of which is indispensable and all of which are together just sufficient to bring about that result" (109). That the cause, in order to "bring about the result," must be more than the "invariable antecedent" is clearly indicated in a distinction which is made between causal connections and other uniformities. " The causal conditions are believed to supply the matter and energy of the consequent or effect," while in the case of uniformities of se- quence "there is no question of the conversion of one (factor) into another" (110). It is impossible to tell in view of the brevity of Professor Wolf's discussion, just how this "conversion" is to be interpreted. Any anthropomorphism which may be involved in such a conception, the author contends, is no reason for its rejection, for every notion in science sins in the same way; without anthropomorphism science must be dumb. Furthermore, some such conception of causation seems to be a necessary aid to the understanding of "the continuity of natural events," for in its absence "each succeeding state of nature would appear to follow the preceding state by a kind of miracle" (112). I am certain that most positivists would object to this; abolition of the idea of "production" does not necessarily imply resorting to the notion of "miracle." It is hard to tell which of these notions would be more distasteful to the positivist. As a matter of fact, of course, he has nothing to do with either. The author's discussion of scientific explanation contains a wealth of suggestive material, though its sketehy nature makes comment im- possible. Could I be sure that I understood the author, I should disagree with him in certain fundamental points. A. CORNELrus BENJAMIN. UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.</page></plain_text>
