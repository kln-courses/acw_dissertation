[Sept., Are There Traces of Greek Philosophy in the Septuagint ?* The investi- gations of this question by German scholars during the years 1830-5o have never been brought to any definite issue and should be continued. H. Hody was the first to assert that foreign philosophy influenced the Seventy. Mich- aelis found Gnostic ideas in a few passages. Their positions were refuted by Ernesti and Horn. GfrSrer (1831) sought to show that the Septuagint was the source of Alexandrian theosophy. Di~hne (1833) went further and maintained that many of Plato's thoughts had found place in this translation and that Philo and the Christian Alexandrians, Clement and Origen, were largely in- debted to it in their philosophical ideas. Later these conclusions were disputed by Frankel and Zeller who think that the Seventy had but slight contact with Greek philosophy. Siegfried finds but few traces of this philosophy in the work of the Seventy, as in Gen. I: 2, while Bickell thinks that the avoidance of anthropomorphism can only be explained by the influence of Greek philosoph- ical conceptions. An examination of several terms of philosophical import such as psyche, nous, arete and kosmos as used in LXX. tends to the conclu- sion that Greek philosophy had not influenced the translators. In cases where fhis seems to be the case, we can by no means be sure that we have the original translation of the Seventy, since the quotations from it by Philo show that the text was thus early corrupted and may, in such passages, have been exposed to modification. A learned discussion of a difficult but interesting theme. For the author's argument in detail reference must be-had to the article itself.</page></plain_text>
