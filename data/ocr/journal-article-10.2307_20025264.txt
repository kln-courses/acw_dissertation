<plain_text><page sequence="1">U</page><page sequence="2">The Indian Enterprise Today rr , Rajm Kothari A fter Independence, India's hydroelectric dams? erected as they were to a secular faith?came to be known as Nehru s "new temples." Such projects were to ensure India's future. Today, many recognize that the wings of modernity were not powerful enough to bear the huge nation aloft. Custom still regulates life. Agricul tural cycles still determine national production. Village elders still check the administrations of bureaucrats. Moreover, ancient India has found political proponents of its own. Popular cam paigns are waged to protect tribal communities and primeval forests from the encroachments of development. Traditionalists have countered the modernizers with their own Enlightenment. When I speak of the Indian enterprise, I have in mind first the whole project called India. This is not this or that Indian enterprise, not the governmental enterprise, or the enterprise called economic planning, or some cultural endeavor like literature or cinema, or even the effort to launch some movement of social change. It is an attempt to comprehend the whole of the entity called India. Second, I am concerned with the Indian enterprise today, as it is currently engaged and unfolding, not as it was when India began its career as an independent nation-state and gave itself a constitution and set forth on a journey into the future, on its "tryst with destiny," as Rajni Kothari is an Honorary Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi. 51</page><page sequence="3">52 Rajni Kothari Jawaharlal Nehru put it in 1947.1 mean, rather, the enterprise as it is now, more than forty years after Independence?when, following a period of both stability and orderly change, things have begun to go wrong and when the enterprise has the challenge of reassessing its major contours and of restructuring (as well as redefining) its basic dimensions and thrust. At any rate, that is how the situation looks to me. Third, the enterprise I am trying to see in layout is not the one that has already become but one that is becoming, not something that has been laid out on the grounds and institutionalized and made into a going concern, where the task is to simply keep going, despite some problems of change and transition, into another generation of statehood or nationhood. It is, rather, something still happening and in some ways happening anew, because of new stirrings and turmoil caused by new spurts of consciousness and awakening, new pressures that are emanating from various sources, new voices that are struggling to be heard. It is not a Sweden or a Japan that I am trying to describe; it is India?still in the throes of change and transforma tion. What I am trying to do, then, is to comprehend an ancient, continuing entity in its current unfolding in the face of myriad challenges and contrary pulls. It is an attempt to understand and unravel not just what the entity is about but how precisely it is an endeavor (either by design or by drift) to become something in a highly uncertain world. I am thinking of that entity as a single enterprise, in all its thrusts and counterthrusts, its new expressions in an endogenous search and sweep for identity (including both its past legacies and its present efforts at change and transformation), and its reactions to the exogenous forces reinforcing it or seeking to deflect it from its main course. I am aware that such an attempt could be dismissed by some who are steeped in specialized disciplines as an impossible task and that at any rate it is bound to be not just provocative but controver sial. This opinion does not worry or deter me. If anything, it acts as a spur. Let me proceed. What then is the Indian enterprise today like? According to the dominant view, it is the building of a strong and viable center, in the form of a nation-state, to overcome a legacy of fragmentation and divisiveness, an attempt to modernize a traditional society and democratize an inherently unequal and nonegalitarian social order, an enterprise of meeting the "Western challenge" (which in a way for</page><page sequence="4">The Indian Enterprise Today 53 the first time made Indians self-conscious) by accepting innovations brought by modern science and technology, by a centralized state and a secular ideology. I happen to hold that the Indian enterprise is all this but not just this. It is also something altogether different and rather distinctive. It is an enterprise that scales opposite pulls and thrusts in a creative encounter between apparent dichotomies, that makes the most of the Indian genius for tolerance and use of ambiguities and contradictions. It is an enterprise that injects through such an encounter a regener ative consciousness on several layers of both indigenous and new thresholds, releasing in the process new actors, new agendas, and new and hitherto submerged voices, generating a new language of both self-understanding and societal understanding. Seen in this way, it becomes an enterprise in which a dormant civilization is coming alive through a wholly new process of consciousness and communi cation, and for that purpose, using the instrumentalities of state, technology, and secular power. It recaptures and reinterprets the old in an effort to come to terms with but also reinterpret and transform the new. It does not exclude "the other," be it the large repertoire of its various pasts and its various locales or the new and equally large repertoire of infusions from "the outside"?the various outsides. It is both eclectic and agglomerative (not aggregative, as in Western democratic practice) and highly selective and reticent when it comes to things that continue to remain alien to and disruptive of its authentic self. It is an enterprise that is rooted in the past but unfolding in the present and that looks toward and anticipates an uncertain future in an attempt to perceive and absorb it into something that is livable and worthwhile. The enterprise is not a simple mixture of the old and the new, not even a reconciliation of tradition and modernity in some synthetic product, not several centuries coexisting in some form of parallel formations and/or leftovers but something altogether different from everything else. At the same time it is something not imposed from either outside or "up there." The enterprise is a search for an alternative course for India, an alternative to something that was implanted and tried out at one time but that didn't work, that turned sour and became a source of domination and destruction and alienation. But it is not an alterna tive in terms of another abstract universal, some kind of "paradigm</page><page sequence="5">54 Rajni Kothari shift" in both theory and practice, something to be achieved in some distant future on the basis of some Utopian vision. In India it is, rather, something to be churned out from a long history encompass ing many diversities?the living past (much of it still around), the attempted present, and the emergent tomorrows. This is the differ ence between the postmodern dream of proponents of alternatives in the West and a perspective that transforms without either annihilat ing or even disowning tradition or turning the back wholly on the modern.1 The point is that the "modern" enterprise is taken seriously in India by both the elites and the common people?in some ways by the latter more seriously than by the former, with greater faith in its capacity to liberate itself from the fossilized accretions and anachro nisms (as well as the sterilities) of the past?but this enterprise is found out not to have worked and, according to some, not to be worth pursuing any longer. And yet from the very experience and expectations generated by this experiment, from the very faith in it, have sprung forth new awakenings and aspirations, struggles based on these, and perhaps new possibilities. The crucial point is that the Indian enterprise today is not the same as what started after Independence in 1947, the launching of the republic in 1950, and the years that followed, often characterized as "the Nehru years." Today, ironically, Nehru, the very pacesetter of modern India, sounds like a distant voice in the background, still strong no doubt but increasingly a resonance that sounds remote and abstract. For one thing, there is a drastically changed meaning of India's key concepts and values. What was the stability of the system and the security of large masses, for instance, is today the security of a narrow and increasingly narrowing elite. What started as the modernization of a whole society, taking large masses of the people in its sweep, based on a negotiated consciousness across social structures and thresholds, has been reduced to modernization of the already modern, the socially malleable, and the ready-to-be co-opted, excluding the rest, building a structure of ins and outs. From involving diverse communities and religio-ethnic-linguistic affiliations in a framework of eclectic secularism, the Indian ruling elite has moved to a concept of secularism in which a homogenizing state is striving to create a homogenous society, undermining all pluralities and imposing one overarching secular thrust defined by a centralized</page><page sequence="6">The Indian Enterprise Today 55 regime and a centralized system. In each case, both the meaning system and the operational contours have changed. Concepts like nation building have failed to prevent?and have often led to?polarizations that have produced one major divide across which it is becoming increasingly difficult to communicate, coperceive, be sensitive. A peculiar ethos of language and communi cation is developing in this "two-world" scenario.2 It is against this overturning of both meaning systems and opera tional contours and institutions that the new churnings have to be perceived and understood. The point is that even if the new voices are still both not loud enough and too hesitant, no thinking about the future that does not include them, draw upon their implied and explicit articulations, and resonate the whole through their assertions and solidarities can be of much use. And, on the other hand, the more established and crystallized voices, and the organized entities from which they emerge and speak forth, which one has got so used to hearing, may be already becoming less and less relevant and significant when it comes to determining the future course of this ancient land. There is, then, this as yet undecided encounter?between the forces of absorption in the civilizational mold on the one hand and co-optation within the dominant and in many ways alien framework imposed from above on the other, with strong embeddedness of powerful interests appearing to stem the new churnings and stirrings from the lower reaches of the whole society, frustrating them and often dividing and confusing them. Yet, there is a distinct texturing of new possibilities, based on local and intermediate levels gaining ascendancy, with the higher levels proving increasingly incapable of managing things. Both the scenario of growing polarization, declining communica tion across the divide, the building of impregnable walls of quaran tine, and the pushing back of those knocking at the doors and the scenario of strong challenges from the bottom, new consciousness of rights, and effective injection of newness and insecurity in dominant circles are real. Who will win out is not clear. Perhaps no one will. It will all depend on the nature of "the new dialogue"?and the new institutional and ideological framework of that dialogue. It seems to me that this framework will be increasingly decided by the ground forces, by the people rather than their representatives, by the profes sional supporters of countervailing forces, all of this aided by a</page><page sequence="7">56 Rajni Kothari changing structure of national and international structures and resources. In the process the very institutions of the state, technology, and development will undergo change. Not readily of course, but under new compulsions provided by both demonstrated failures of the system and emergent alternatives to it. As this change occurs, significant segments within the scientific and professional circles may also come forward and join forces. And with their joining, the already growing voices and stirrings of consciousness from the humanities and the arts will make themselves felt closer to center stage, from which they have been marginalized for so long. As they move into the light, traditional institutions?Westminster style democracy, Keynesian economics, state-led centralized plan ning, most of which are performing less and less anyway?will be forced to readjust to the new churnings and stirrings, the new challenges and encounters, the new actors and agendas represented by the new professionals and the now more confident voices from both the folk cultures and the creative arts and humanities. For long these latter layers of the Indian landscape have been effectively depoliticized and taken out of the mainstream of public discourse; for too long they have been either reduced to instruments of cheap entertainment (melas and festivals and tableaus in Republic Day parades) for the elite and for foreigners or elevated to being honored sycophants of the rulers through state patronage, dished out increas ingly to less and less independent individuals and groups. And yet in India it is these folk cultures and creative writers and artists and chroniclers of people's collective strivings and joys and pangs that have provided its more authentic expressions and language. The perceptions and understandings of the folk and their cultures, the practices and articulate voices of peasant communities, and the live throbbings and ancestral heritages of tribal and hill peoples, as well as the both received and constantly improvised wisdom of old women and their menfolk have provided the real voices, and they continue to provide the same in the large land masses of today's India. They lie submerged and have often been made dormant under colonial and colonizing impacts of aliens from both abroad and within India (the nonresident Indians?the NRIs?as well as the resident non-Indians, in the inimitable words of my colleague D. L. Sheth).</page><page sequence="8">The Indian Enterprise Today 57 All along, India has harbored enormous versatility of skill and ingenuity?both through prolonged continuity and through ever new acquisition?as well as an array of absolutely brilliant individuals. In one way these individuals have appeared in unconventional and deviant forms but have at the same time in other ways been highly constructive, giving, and other-oriented. What is more, they have always operated from within groups and communities, with highly schematized institutional structures no doubt, but at the same time open (and relaxed) with respect to less structured processes of dialogue, disputations, and constructions emerging from the dia logue. A very large spread of such individuals and institutional entities has been there in the past and is there today too, not just in the form of castes and village networks to which individuals belong by virtue of their birth and location but also in the form of a whole series of voluntaristic bodies through which a variety of interests and affiliations?and individual creativity?is expressed. Spiritually, there is the great urge to reach for an individualistic ethos: the ultimate end is to be freed from worldly obligations and the cycle of birth and death. But there is an equally great accent on belongingness?on dharma, not just in terms of duties enshrined according to one's birth and station in life but also in terms of obligations to a whole variety of fellow beings as well as to larger and more abstract social entities. Indeed, what sets India apart in terms of perception of the human element is that in it the individual is at once seeking liberation and seeking community. Hence the far greater relevance of the language of humanities and aesthetics, which evoke affinities and sensitize one to issues of good and evil, than of the sciences, which only depict and explain reality and that in too precise and specialized a way to lend it to human intervention. Equally clear is the Indian affinity for nonhuman species, other forms of life, even inanimate entities?in short, to nature and its endless mysteries. This too is captured much better in the language of humanities and of the folk than in the language of science and of the centralized state. All this has of course been pushed somewhat into the background in the long and brutal?and brutalizing?march of the global, the universal, the centralizing, and the scientific civilization. But all has by no means been conquered, far less vanquished. It is, after forty years of tutelage to an alien framework of centralized governance and monopolized power structures, beginning to reassert itself. This is</page><page sequence="9">58 Rajni Kothari taking a vast variety of forms?struggles for tribal rights and preser vation of valued life-styles, assertion of peasant communities against urban industrial colonizations, demands for autonomous ethnic and national "homelands." There is growing realization that people will have to recover their own forgotten know-how and technical skills and cultural endowments for recovering nature on their side instead of relying on the state, which has, by building huge dams and taking on other gigantic projects?Nehru's "new temples"?only deprived the "locals" of their means of sustenance and livelihood. These locals have yet to coalesce into effective interest groups, and there is still a long way to go before various constituents representing the new voices will be able to see beyond their immediate concerns and disillusionments to an alternative way to organize life in society on the basis of a new theory. The new system should allow both negative protest against wrongs and search for positive alternatives, conceptions of justice based on everyone having more of what others have as well as a just and humane order based on new and fresh thinking. A just and humane order may well come about as people look beyond immediate disasters and deprivations. But it may not, given the capacity of the "system" to confuse issues and carry on. And yet there is little doubt that the essential Indian enterprise cannot be adequately understood without taking these issues into account. While I regard recovery of some aspects of people's accumulated wisdom as necessary to any search for both authenticity and func tional relevance, the main endeavor that I see the emergent forces engaged in is essentially transformative. Crucial to this transformation is the democratic revolution, in which large parts of the Indian phenomenon are involved. Indeed, in one way or another almost the whole of India is involved in a democratic churning, which affects the social fabric, the institutions of the state (despite many erosions and letdowns), and both political and economic as well as cultural and ethical ferment. This ferment has changed the criteria of perception and affect, of appraisal and affliction. The traditional criteria of status based on one's birth and station in life, veneration of age and antiquity, and location of the self in a hierarchy sanctioned by hallowed usage are still there and do get used from time to time, but they are clearly on the decline and have given way to new criteria of status and respect, new responsibilities and strivings. It is a revolution of a very different kind from the</page><page sequence="10">The Indian Enterprise Today 59 French or the Russian or the Chinese, for it entails nothing so drastic and undermining of entire social structures. It is something much slower, more low-key and continuous, often drawing on memories of earlier challenges to hegemonic structures. It is cumulative and absorbent of upsets and backlashes that have been of late occurring in rather disturbing ways. In many ways it is an irreversible revolu tion in values and perceptions, in meaning systems, decisive in its transformation of traditional social strivings, for it is more basic than many of the more celebrated and dramatized revolutions. (Many of them are today felt to be betrayed.) Socially, the revolution involves the creation of a new majority (if one must speak in terms of majorities and minorities) based on an agglomeration of the traditionally deprived and dispossessed, includ ing a large series of peripheries and minorities as defined in both traditional and more modern electoral and communal terms. This new majority is still in the making3 and has recently been threatened with dislodging from the Indian imagination by the rise of chauvinist tendencies and exclusivist claims to legitimacy in respect to the access to state power of a few upper-caste Hindus speaking for "the Hindu majority" (a total misconception of Hinduism). I have no doubt that this collision between a majority based on a powerful upswing of long-term transformation and an artificial and concocted majority brought up by counterrevolutionary forces will come to pass, though only after long struggle and not a little violence and show of raw might and social perversity. The broad thrust of this democratic transformation is quite clear and unambiguous. Its real test came during the Indian Emergency in 1975-1976 when both the norm setters (the intellectuals and opinion makers) and the people demonstrated beyond doubt their preference for democratic values and assertions. After that, even the facile Marxist critique of democracy as a bourgeois luxury was completely disabused and democracy ceased to be a dirty word in the lexicon of the so-called radicals. The liberals too learned the lesson that democracy did not consist of mere change of elites and governments on the basis of electoral games but went to the heart of the condition of the people themselves (on which the Marxists had always laid stress). And there emerged a new and resounding consensus about the value of democracy in the process of social transformation. Today, whether this transformation be the violent overthrow of a class</page><page sequence="11">60 Rajni Kothari enemy as advocated by the Marxist-Leninists (the Naxalites), or the reformist rejuvenation of prevailing social structures as found in a spate of efforts taking place within the Hindu, the Muslim, and the Sikh fold, or the extremist and even terrorist uprisings on both the Left and the Right, the one watchword by which they all swear is democracy. This then is the crux of the Indian enterprise today, set in the comprehensive and eclectic civilizational mold laid out in the early pages of this article. At this stage some caveats are in order. First, to the extent that the democratic enterprise depends on struggles and churnings from below while those at the top feel insecure and inhibited in the face of such challenge, isn't there a danger that political institutions?namely, the state, the political parties, the legislatures, and the judiciary?will become alienated from the main stream? Unless the mainstream institutions are able to take in the new upsurges as important inputs to their own thinking and functioning, isn't there further danger of the new stirrings at the bottom becoming isolated and fragmented and in the end not making much headway when it comes to the operation of the larger system? Second, as alienation of the mainstream from the grass roots and of the grass roots from the mainstream grows, it is likely that a climate of confrontation will develop, that frustration will set in and the possibility of any meaningful dialogue recede. The resulting vacuum would be filled by increasing violence, based on the one hand on a state of despair and anomie among the deprived and oppressed, and on the other hand on organized efforts by determined groups bent on striking terror into the people. As this happens, the whole arena of "movements" will get drawn into the vortex of violence and its increasingly professional use. In recent years there has been a phenomenal growth of violence in India encompassing both state terrorism and vandalism by the agents of the state as well as terrorism "from below." As terrorism grows, there also takes place a considerable growth in social violence, between individuals, among the lower classes, within the deprived communities, some of which are drawn into crime as a way of living as well as livelihood. In short, unless the democratic struggles emerging from the grass roots are able to inspire new thinking and reconstructed agendas within the mainstream, unless the movement for alternatives is to some extent also reflected in the</page><page sequence="12">The Indian Enterprise Today 61 mainstream opponents of the established regime, there is every likelihood that the agents of violence will prove destabilizing for the forces of change. In the meanwhile the establishment is likely to lean more and more on chauvinist backlash against opposition of all kinds and on global technocratic solutions that are based on exclusion of large segments of the population from the purview of the state and the development process. There is a strange kind of populism emerging from the technological promise of the twenty-first century, the slow discrediting of the state as an institution and the new promise of privatization that will open up new vistas for whoever wants to move into the growing vacuum and take charge. The competitive ethos involved in this emergence can, through the growing power of the mass media, particularly television, influence the minds of the ordinary people too. In fact, that is how the technocratic elite would present democracy to the people?it would implore them to come out of their passivity and move ahead, leaving the others behind. This accent on competition provides a totally different rationale for democracy than the ideal of the decades after the Indian Constitution was inaugurated. Unless the democratic spirit is once again rekin dled?not just at the bottom but also in the middle and upper reaches of the system?there is every likelihood that democracy itself will become a battleground rather than provide a framework of consen sus, as was the case during the so-called Nehru era. To put the whole thing differently, the democratic process on which the Indian enter prise today hinges has entered a new phase. The initiators and bearers of the democratic process are not what they were when the much talked of "Indian experiment" began. They are not the old liberal bourgeoisie, which was theoretically supposed to be the backbone of democratic institutions; it seems to have lost faith in the parliamen tary model and to be scared of the growing populist pressures on it. They are not the old-fashioned nationalists who put so much store in a model of nation building that could draw diverse social strands into the great excitement of creating one united India; today the nation alists have fallen prey to the psychosis of thinking that the country is in danger and are accepting new doctrines of stability and security that make the Indian nation increasingly exclusive and leave a whole lot of segments stranded, and in fact considered dangerous and hence dispensable.</page><page sequence="13">62 Rajni Kothari Similarly, it is not the earlier kind of supporters from abroad, from the Western democracies, who were keen on seeing the largest democracy in the world succeed; driven by their own changed set of global priorities, and scared of the ground swell of popular upsurge and economic demands round the world, these countries are far more keen on selling ideas of liberalization and privatization and on protecting their growing capital investments. They want easy access to markets for technologies and to hinterlands and forests for the produce of nature, to a new system of internal and external security and the models of surveillance and intelligence that go with it. And it is not the Indian state that is supposed to be an agent of egalitarian reordering of an unequal social order; the state today is increasingly becoming an agent of both the new ideology of privat ization and the new ideology of a national security state, which often degenerates into a personal security state whose resources are dispro portionately devoted to the security and safety of a few, including the security of their various jaunts and retreats and festivals. Increasingly, the responsibility of carrying on the democratic process is falling to the people who are becoming targets of all these distortions and perversities and fears and insecurities?namely, the very poor and deprived masses at the grass roots and their mobilizers and catalysts, of whom the elite seem to be getting wary lest the turmoil from the bottom upset the too finely and fragiley poised applecart.4 But, as the poor and the deprived and their catalysts prepare to keep their democratic struggles going, they are faced with the challenge of rethinking political agendas, reconceptualizing the crit ical locations of democratic spaces, and revising their earlier notions of what the Indian state and its democratic supporters abroad (through aid and transfers) can in fact do. As such rethinking proceeds?evidence is growing that this is proceeding apace and in several locations quickening?new thresholds of democratic action are likely to take shape. They will be based on opening new spaces in civil society rather than within the framework of the state, on fending for oneself and one's community, on asserting the rights of commu nities and regions and ethnic identities, on internal restructuring and reform by expanding the role for women, for local society's own monitors, and even for a new genre of protectors and militants, who will provide new modes and levels of regard and honor and dignity. A revolution of rights is on the upswing and becoming central to the</page><page sequence="14">The Indian Enterprise Today 63 democratic enterprise?rights regarding health and nutrition, envi ronment and women, housing and shelter, destitute children, home lands for tribal and hill people, access to water and land and village commons and fuel, and, above all, the rights of millions of people displaced, unemployed, and ravaged by "development projects." A wholly new agenda of concerns and claims is on the anvil. And it is being propelled into the democratic spaces of both civil society and the state by a wholly new set of actors and organizations. I have been witness to the new phenomenon of the people concluding that "nothing will happen out there" and that "we will have to do it," both by large assertions of popular will vis-?-vis the apparatus of the state and by relying on processes of self-help and self-determination, unfortunately also being forced to acquire fire power to make their collective wills resonate and become effective. There is a lot of raw protest and bluntness in these assertions, a large dose of effrontery, a lot of anger, not a little contempt for the rulers, but also a large measure of a new confidence of the "we shall prevail" kind. Under lying it all is not just a new understanding of democratic self-assertion but also a new language through which to communicate democratic self-assertion. It is a language that neither the investigative journalist nor the NGO-style activist would readily understand, much less the academic specialist and the member of Parliament who is supposed to be a representative of the people. It is a language that the new India will ignore at its peril. These voices from below are the new green shoots of the demo cratic enterprise. That they behave in a certain manner should not surprise us. After all, there have been just too much humiliation and hurt and hackle in the system; too many women raped in police stations; too much forced prostitution and hot terror being thrust onto women and children; too much discrimination and dishonesty in the running of institutions that lead to suicide, often of the highly gifted and qualified. The decline of democracy of the Nehruvian variety has ushered in a real breakdown of both norms and struc tures, an unbelievable swing and sway of corrupt practices that have put an end to all accountability and produced an atmosphere of normative breakdown and a free-for-all. Under these conditions the various struggles for democracy have of necessity to be waged in unconventional ways, often affecting finer balances of constitutional government and reinforcing confrontational postures on all sides.</page><page sequence="15">64 Rajni Kothari The democratic enterprise in India is still quite fragile and vulner able to both internal and external disturbances, despite deeply ingrained commitments and resiliences. There is an air of instability arising out of a considerable weakening of institutional safeguards against misuse of power and authority and a continuing infliction of injustice on large masses of the people. There is a growing sense of injustice and of misuse of power and privilege. The only reassuring thing is that all this is being increasingly realized, and realized at all levels, including the higher reaches of the operating system and the sensitive segments of the elite. Party politicians, bureaucrats, professionals belonging to various sciences seem to become concerned and anxious (even though they are still few in number). There is also evidence of new understanding and the growth of a slowly crystallizing consensus on issues on which till very recently there was wide disagreement?on the need for decentraliza tion, electoral reforms, participation and empowerment of the pe ripheries, a renewed stress on employment generation and poverty alleviation. There is still much disagreement over the means to satisfy these needs?all the way from high tech and homogenizing solutions to more Gandhian, pluralistic, and dispersed forms of rural resur gence. But there is agreement on the need to restructure the apparatus of power and the framework of authority. I am convinced that the only lasting transformation from micro struggles for alternatives to macro formations that provide feasible transitions to a national democratic crystallization will have to come through the growth of a federalized and decentralized political framework. This is indicated not only by the considerable shift that has already been achieved from a centralized to a more federal political structure over the last few years (with so many non-Congress governments in office, many of them willing to decentralize the political process further down) but also by the more basic shifts that are in evidence from a state-centered process of social transformation to one that opens up spaces in civil society, from treating people as objects of elite benevolence to treating them as subjects who should directly decide their own destinies. All of this draws on the Indian cultural proclivity for a diverse and pluralistic structure of democracy.5 Such consensus, still very slow in emerging and pitched against many contrary pulls, is being reinforced by one overriding realiza</page><page sequence="16">The Indian Enterprise Today 65 tion?that we are dealing with a society bedeviled by the persistence of the curse of poverty but also one in which the sources of exclusion are not just between the rich and the poor, not just class-based, but also along many other dimensions of exclusion: gender, ethnicity, the future generations, nature. Hence the great significance of the dem ocratic enterprise in India's contemporary attempt to regain its identity. The India of the excluders wants to fly into the twenty-first century alone, without "the other India." This they consider dispens able, but so is their view of India as a civilization. Their view is based on a techno-managerial vision, imbibed from the postmodern West, without either historical antecedents or cultural roots, that reduces living cultures to dead exhibits (? la the Festival of India). The point is that this enterprise of the excluders and the exhibitors is not the Indian enterprise. It is an alien enterprise, undertaken by local aliens,6 inspired by alien influences, and supported by nonres ident Indians. It is the struggles of those who are excluded and the concerns of those who recognize their condition that constitute the Indian enterprise?an enterprise that is at once a continuation of the Indian Constitution promulgated in 1950 and an effort to keep alive an ancient civilization and its ethical, ecological, and cultural fabric. This is an effort to keep the good alive in the fashion of a new assertion of will against today's predators; to keep the native mahua and sal trees alive, but to resist the alien eucalyptus; to keep the rivers alive and resist the dams; to keep the folk and tribal cultures alive and resist their museumized and fossilized forms; and with this, to revive the respect for the humanities and the arts, which have been pushed off center stage by the rise of positivist science; to revive the regard for wisdom and insight, which have been pushed out by the stress on professionalism and expertise. Seen in this way, the contemporary democratic enterprise is also an enterprise of civilizational continuity in the context of a world in transformation. Indeed, the anguished craving of this large civiliza tion based on a plurality of cultures and their togetherness (a distinctively Indian concept) to survive in the face of both excluding and homogenizing tendencies is part of today's Indian enterprise. It is an enterprise of pluralist recovery of the rights of so many that are oppressed ,and marginalized but one that also builds on the lasting and conserving elements of an ancient land as against the dispens</page><page sequence="17">66 Rajni Kothari ability and obsolescence that are built into the colonizing project of both the modern Indian state and the global enterprise of integrating that state by colonizing it. The democratic enterprise in which the Indian people are involved must resist both. Finally, this Indian enterprise is based on a distinctive conception of humanism?refusing to be obsessed by the atomized conception of the self, transcending anthropomorphism, creating in the human the capacity to be one with nonhuman species and with creation as a whole, and on that deeper naturalistic conception, generating the ability to identify with "the other" and to respect the rights of others as a basis of a humane civilization. It is in this distinctive conception of a humanistic civilization that the contemporary enterprise of democratic rejuvenation needs to be located. But this can only happen if the accumulated froth and perversities are also resisted and fought against as an essential part of the enterprise. Both the recovery of the Indianness of India (as against the dominance of alien structures and ideologies) and the inclusion of those that have been excluded by both tradition and modernity as essential to that Indianness is what the Indian enterprise is about.7 ENDNOTES Hn arriving at this formulation, I have drawn on Ashis Nandy's intervention at the planning meeting for this Daedalus issue, held at Cochin on 3-7 January 1987. 2See "The Phenomenon of Two Indias," in my book State Against Democracy: In Search of Humane Governance (New Delhi: Ajanta, 1988); "Flight into the 21st Century: Millions Will Be Stranded," Times of India, 27 April 1987; and "Bridging the Two Worlds," in Transformation and Survival: In Search of Humane World Order (New Delhi: Ajanta, 1988). 3 Of all people Mrs. Gandhi understood the meaning of the new majority the best (defined by political analysts as her "winning coalition") until her insecurities got the better of her insights and her craving for somehow hanging on to state power became more important than her original urge to emerge as a leader of the Indian masses. Her two sons led her up the garden path too, disabusing her of her commitment to socialism, secularism, and a positive state. For a fuller appraisal of Indira Gandhi's role, see my "Integration and Exclusion in Indian Politics" in my book Politics and the People: In Search of a Humane India (New Delhi: Ajanta, 1989), also published in Economic and Political Weekly 23 (43) (22 October 1988). 4On all this, see the materials put out by Lokayan, an organization of intellectuals and social activists in India (13 Alipur Road, Delhi 110 054, India). See also the</page><page sequence="18">The Indian Enterprise Today 61 series of articles on the nonparty political process in the Economic and Political Weekly, by Harsh Sethi, "Groups in a New Politics of Transformation," 18 February 1984; by D. L. Sheth, "Grassroots Initiatives in India," 11 February 1984; and by me, "Masses, Classes and the State," 1 February 1986, and "The Non-Party Political Process," 4 February 1984. The various themes explored in these paragraphs are more fully dealt with in my book State Against Democracy. 5 On the argument that there have been important cultural and institutional strains in India that have facilitated the acceptance and spread of a democratic polity, see my article, "Why Has India Been Democratic?" in State Against Democracy (New Delhi, Ajanta, 1988). 6On this theme, see my "New Generation," Seminar (January 1986) and "Whose India?" Seminar (January 1987). 7A suggestion was made at the conference for this issue in April 1988 that I should provide a glimpse of my own intellectual journey in understanding the Indian model of development, for I have changed my position substantially. I find this difficult to do in this article in any manner except inferentially. Those aware of my earlier works will of course recognize the shifts that have taken place in my position. Moreover, I have described the changes in two chapters entitled "Introduction: Changing Perspective on Indian Politics" and "Reminiscences and Reflections" in my book Politics and the People: In Search of a Humane India, vol. 1.
