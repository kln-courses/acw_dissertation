<plain_text><page sequence="1">VEBLEN AND MARX BY BERNARD ROSENBERG X here is much disagreement as to whether the work of Thor- stein Veblen did or did not derive from Marx. What Veblen himself had to say on this matter may be gleaned from his lectures at Harvard University in April 1906, entitled "The Socialist Eco- nomics of Karl Marx and His Followers." * In these lectures Veblen made explicit his opposition to certain aspects of Marxism while admitting, perhaps with a touch of irony, that in toto Marxian thought was "characterized by a certain boldness of con- ception and a great logical consistency." 2 For it is precisely in the matter of logic that Veblen felt himself at variance with Marx. He rejected Hegelian rationalism and contrasted Marx's depend- ence upon it with his own Darwinian position. Veblen's work stands for a 'complete break with classical economics. This is ostensibly true of Marx as well, and yet, according to Veblen, Marx took an uncritical attitude toward the principles of natural liberty and natural rights, notions that Veblen repudiated again and again. Even Marx's theory of surplus value, which in Veb- len's opinion can be traced to Ricardo, William Thompson, and other utilitarians on the one hand, and neo-Hegelianism on the other, he found unacceptable. Marx's view of history was teleo- logical; Veblen's was not. Marx saw a resistless movement toward socialism; Veblen discerned no such inevitability in the social process. And finally, Veblen branded Marx as a "romantic philosopher," 3 and strongly implied that socialism was tenable only if recast in terms of Darwinism, that is, with emphasis on blindly cumulative change instead of dialectical sequence. 1 See Veblen, The Place of Science in Modern Civilization and Other Essays (New York 1919) pp. 409-56. 2 Ibid., p. 409. * Ibid., p. 430.</page><page sequence="2">loo SOCIAL RESEARCH At least by his own attestations at this mature period in his career,4 Veblen categorically dissociated himself from orthodox Marxism, and his objection to the Social Democrats was no less emphatic. He accused them of having succumbed to jingoism and militarism, especially in Germany, and feared that a similar infection would spread throughout the socialist movement. How then has it come about that one conventionally refers to Veblen as just another, albeit an ingenious, Marxist? The answer lies in one point of congruence which is vital to all that stems from it. Both men agreed on the determinative importance of what they called the state of the industrial arts. Interestingly enough, each denied what his work affirms - that he regarded technology as very nearly the exclusive cause of every societal phenomenon, which had, in consequence, only a superstructural reality. Thus Engels said in one of his letters: "Marx and I are partly respon- sible for the fact that at times our disciples have laid more weight upon the economic factor than belongs to it. We were com- pelled to emphasize its central character in opposition to our opponents who denied it, and there wasn't always time, place, and occasion to do justice to other factors in the reciprocal interactions of the historical process/' 5 Similarly, Veblen asserted that "it is assumed that in the growth of culture, as in its current main- tenance, the facts of technological use and wont are fundamental and definitive, in the sense that they underlie and condition the scope and method of civilization in other than the technological respect, but not in such a sense as to preclude or overlook the degree in which these other conventions of any given civilizations in their turn react to the state of the industrial arts." 6 These protestations cannot be ignored. They demonstrate indisputably that each man was aware of more than one causal * By this time Veblen had already written his most substantive studies, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York 1899) and The Theory of Business Enter- àrise CNew York iqoa) . s Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Selected Correspondence (New York 1942) P- 273- • Veblen, The Instinct of Workmanship (New York 1914) p. vii.</page><page sequence="3">VEBLÈN AND MARX loi factor. Nevertheless, in their work they seldom exhibited this awareness. We are constrained to agree with Max Weber who maintained that Marxism was "an untenable monocausal theory and thus prejudicial to an adequate reconstruction of social and historical connections" and also that it raised a "segmental per- spective to paramount importance by reducing the multiplicity of causal factors to a single-factor theorem." 7 Disclaimers are in the nature of afterthought. For the most part, Marx and Veblen were technological determinists. In this matter there is some justification for lumping them together as Sims does under the rubric of those who believe in "the automatic process" of social change.8 For all his differences with Marx, on this issue Veblen was closely allied with him. His criticism of Marxian metaphysics was trenchant and to a large extent valid. Moreover, within the framework of what must be regarded as their common error, he would appear to have been more correct than his great predeces- sor, for while Marx and Veblen may equally be accused of the reduction fallacy, Marx went further and insisted that the sub- structure of technology and the superstructure of archaic insti- tutions would soon come into a state of equilibrium, whereas Veblen frequently stated his skepticism with regard to any such outcome. By the time they issued the Manifesto in 1848, Marx and Engels doubtless believed in the imminence of a communist revolution. But Veblen, dealing with the irrational as Marxists do not, could foresee an indefinite disequilibrium, a cultural lag extending itself in perpetuity. In a discussion of John Bates Clark's economics he wrote: "Men are congenitally over-sanguine. ... It turns out that the laws of (human) nature malevolently grind out vexation for men instead of benevolently furthering the greatest happiness of the greatest number." 9 This point of view, which in the face of recent developments really seems to be sound, is a flat contradiction of what Veblen 7 Max Weber, Essays in Sociology (New York 1946) p. 47. » JNeweu .Leroy òims, frooiems of social Change (JNew York 1939) pp. 300-02. 9 Veblen, The Place of Science . . .

Veblen, in fact, represents a curious combination of inherent pessimism, such as that expressed above, and an optimism forced upon him by the nature of his analysis. Nor is the pessimistic note, as Dorfman suggests,10 apparent only in his last phase of despair. It runs through all of Veblen's work. It explains his satire and gives sense to his cynicism. It also renders a decided optimism, which is particularly striking in such books as The Theory of Business Enterprise, all the more unnatural. Such general statements, however, may be greatly clarified by a careful examination of Veblen's most important works. ii One of the earliest and most suggestive essays is entitled "Indus- trial and Pecuniary Employments." n In it Veblen foreshadowed the basic differentiation between classes that gradually came to dominate his thinking. He began by challenging the classical idea that there are three factors of production: land, labor, and capital. This formula, for one thing, rests on a belief in provi- dential order and, for another, looks upon mere acquisition as part of the productive process. Neither of these assumptions was admissible to Veblen. He advanced the theory that modern economic activity is controlled by the very acquisitive elements conceived in most quarters to be incidental features of social pro- duction and consumption. The hard and fast distinction between industrial employment, which is productive, and pecuniary employment, which is not, here makes its initial appearance in what was to be a frequent and brilliant demonstration. Veblen recognized that there are people in noneconomic occupations, but for the most part he regarded them as superfluities.12 Members of the army and the clergy especially represent this group. His 10 Joseph Dorfman, Thorstein Veblen and His America (New York 1934) p. 467. 11 Veblen, The Place of Science . . .

Those whose sole preoccupation is business and whose one aim is profits are useful to nobody and are detrimental to the community at large. Their fiscal or financiering norms rest firmly on the institution of property. They wish to buy and sell; it is distribution that matters to them, not production. The businessmen necessarily come into conflict with those who actu- ally seek industrial efficiency, the former impeding consolidation, the latter struggling for its attainment. Veblen pointed out that the first consequence of this reasoning is to dissociate the two ideas of productivity and remuneration. The most lucrative positions seem to be those which are least serviceable to mankind. Thus, if a law of natural selection were operative in society, the pecuniary class would be eliminated. The natural elimination of an undesirable class also presupposes a beneficent order - onward and upward - such as Veblen was constitutionally unable to accept. Economic deterioration is possible and does occur - Spencer and the other meliorative philosophers notwithstanding. Hence in some measure Veblen was dependent on Marx,13 although what he said was recast in a peculiar jargon. Veblen, however, was not taken in by any romantic idea of progress. The tension between an anachronistic ruling class and the underlying population exists - but it may never be resolved. This was his great insight. It measures Veblen's stature as a twentieth-century thinker who felt bitter disappointment in a world of absurd destruction. That he occa- sionally lapsed into the more stereotyped way of looking at social phenomena indicates little more than his position as a transitional figure. Having broken away from much that was held sacred 13 In the characterization of business as a matter of selling dearer and buying cheaper, he even quoted from Capital; see Veblen, The Place of Science . . . (cited above) p. 297.</page><page sequence="6">104 SOCIAL RESEARCH by another generation, he was not quite able to grasp the new approach, though he approximated it often enough. in The Theory of the Leisure Class resists criticism in many ways. Few readers are able to pierce the obscurity of Veblen's style or to cope with his indirection and ambiguity; indeed, for a long time, the public was satisfied to regard him as a sesquepedalian buff on. Veblen protested objectivity and seldom exemplified it. The implications of disapproval in this book, as in all his others, he continually and somewhat tiresomely insisted were apparent but not real. When Veblen remarked that the modern gentle- man is ' 'gifted" with ferocity and that he reverts to savage habits, we are actually asked to believe that there was no deprecation in his voice. Of course there was, and the necessity for caution in presenting such wholly unorthodox views is entirely understand- able. Veblen claimed that he was examining economic matters per se. He admitted the possible aesthetic or poetic value of what may be materially unserviceable to the community. But the ascer- tainment of what is serviceable in itself involves a preconceived notion regarding it. Veblen's Olympian pose camouflages a collection of norms which have to be picked out of his verbiage.14 When methodological and stylistic problems combine in the work of a quasi-scientific satirist there is every chance of misunder- standing him. This is especially true of The Leisure Class, which has been popularly received and widely misunderstood. But there is a corrective to the misapprehensions that are bound to occur this way, and it is contained in The Theory of Business Enterprise, The lay reader hardly knows this study and yet it is the most i* The mere presence of such values as serviceability marks Veblen off from a sociologist like Max Weber, about whom Mannheim rightly observed: "In his Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, (he) made it his central task to work out this stratum of purely 'objectively' perceivable relations, in order to arrive at such a non- evaluative objective field of sociology" (Karl Mannheim, Ideology and Utopia, New York 1946, p. 167) .</page><page sequence="7">VEBLEN AND MARX 105 influential polemic Veblen ever wrote.15 Tugwell refers to it as one of the ten books that have been decisive in shaping twentieth- century thought.16 It is a sober and sociologically clear, if eco- nomically bewildering, presentation. The chapters on loan credit are full of complex mathematical formulas which suggest Veblen's contempt for his reader. In any case, whole sections of the inquiry are left unexplained, but fortunately they do not obtrude upon Veblen's sociological dicta. Here are the familiar antinomies. Modern civilization is com- prised materially of the machine process, which is good, and invest- ment for a profit, which is bad. The norms are implicit but unquestionable. That these two forces are exclusive of each other is as unambiguously stated in The Theory of Business Enterprise as in any of Veblen's books. This assumption is at least arguable and probably invalid, for businessmen contribute something to production even if they do not want it to be entirely unimpeded. Veblen's moderate statement concerning the importance of technology, however, is quite unobjectionable: "To a greater extent than any other known phase of culture, modern Christendom takes its complexion from its economic organiza- tion." 17 Machine process is defined in the broadest sense to include the work of inventors, navigators, mining experts, civil and mechanical engineers, and, in short, all those who have replaced manual dexterity with a reasoned procedure based on scientific knowledge of the forces employed. Where craftsman- like skill used to be essential, mechanical standardization now prevails, controlling not only goods but also services, such as transportation. All the parts of this process are interdependent so that a disturbance in any one of them can derange the whole. In the precapitalistic era, industries were dispersed, isolated, and relatively independent. Eighteenth-century England had such 15 Rexford G.

Now all of this has become so complex that the most delicate balance must be kept, disturbances prevented, and adjustments made. And the businessman is in control of this situation. In a chapter on business principles Veblen refined his dichotomy. He again attacked the natural rights doctrine and the philosophy of John Locke. When workmanlike qualities were predominant, men like Locke could conceive of God as the Great Artificer. But now that the handicraft phase of production has been replaced by impersonal machines, God is thought of in dif- ferent terms, if at all. The idea that man owns what he creates, in much the same manner as God Himself, is attached to an epoch in which petty trade and not high finance held sway. The main feature of contemporary economics is corporate manipulation. Competitive bidding for credit is calculated to enhance the volume of business but not necessarily the amount of capital goods. To a very large extent loans represent fictitious industrial equipment, their raison d'être being to afford the borrower a differential advantage over his competitors. A corporation is now capitalized on the basis of its earning capacity. Its properties and debts belong to a group of persons who are cut off from the managers, and when preferred stock is a large part of a capital this separation, Veblen avowed, is irrevocable. Twice removed from the public interest, the main effort of those in control is to effect an advan- tageous discrepancy in price. Veblen found, in fact, and it is the leitmotif of his work, that all Western institutions rest preponderantly on business principles. This is strikingly true of politics. Domestic and foreign policy, police surveillance, the administration of justice, military and diplomatic service are chiefly concerned with business relations. The very foundation of common law in America and England is natural liberty, and under this dispensation, of all the rights granted none is more prominent than the right to private prop-</page><page sequence="9">VEBLEN AND MARX 107 erty and a correlative protection of it. This idea has been more completely accepted in the United States than anywhere else; here pecuniary obligations are considered sacred. In fact, most obli- gations - domestic, social, and civil - are transformed into and can be fully discharged only on a monetary valuation. Moreover, as Thurman Arnold has said, "toa greater extent than elsewhere public esteem [in the United States] is awarded to artists, actors, preachers, writers, scientists, officials, in some rough proportion to the sums paid for their work."18 Patriotism is the sentiment by means of which the government manufactures approval of its basically undemocratic machinations. According to Veblen, the modern state whose origin lies in the clannish solidarity of feudal lords is today an instrument of business. Since the creation of a world market this indissolubility of interests has been unmistak- able. Contending political parties exist, but they really represent superficially divergent lines of business policy. The common maxim that trade follows the flag, which Veblen would have inverted, expresses the closeness of an interlocking relation between commercial and military policies. Trade is the hand- maiden of war which is waged mostly to benefit business. The people, however, usually believe that they somehow share in the residual gains that come from war, and they support it enthusi- astically. Politics, religion, and business - the first two under the aegis of the third - foster more and bigger wars. They can be terminated under present conditions only by industrial col- lapse and national bankruptcy. The abolition of such evils as war - which are only sympto- matic - can be effected by those for whom it is a disadvantage. The higher ranks of skilled mechanics are filled with such men, who are more than mechanical auxiliaries of the machine process. Their habits of thought are most clearly in accord with the theo- retical or metaphysical presuppositions of modern material science. They are skeptical where their superiors are reactionary. They have developed a discipline that runs counter to conventional is Arnold, The Folklore of Capitalism (New Haven 1937) p. 273.</page><page sequence="10">io8 SOCIAL RESEARCH anthropomorphic beliefs. Their only dogma is cause and effect, which is not yet conservative though it some day may be. Veblen had to conclude from these premises that the workman's allegiance to inherited institutions is crumbling. Individual ownership no longer appeals to them. They will reject the status quo and con- stitute themselves into a revolutionary organization. Here Veblen came face to face with his perplexing dilemma. Why is it that trade unionism does not challenge the price system? Unions are tinctured with the socialistic animus but only to a very limited extent. Veblen was compelled to envisage the radicalization of American labor, yet he did not see it in his own time, and today the opposite tendency is as dominant as ever. Capitalism, somewhat modified but essentially the same, has proved itself capable of survival. The industrial coherence and mechanical restraint that a socialist order would exercise have not come into being; the disaffection which was to have taken place among men in the skilled mechanical trades has failed to materialize. As Veblen knew, the body of unskilled workers is relatively unmoved by radical theories. Nevertheless, in the face of these facts and almost in spite of himself, Veblen had to predict not only a socialistic order but one that would be extremely democratic since "socialists are in a high degree intolerant of any monarchical, aristocratic, or other prescriptive government." 19 Where Veblen is most affected by Marxism he is at least accurate as a prophet. Either he or Marx could have said not alone that machine industry, directly or indirectly, gives rise to socialism but that the two are really expressions of the same complex of causes. Logically, socialism must triumph. Veblen's last chapter is entitled "The Natural Decay of Business Enterprise," but its final paragraph reveals his struggle. Having left none but the logical socialistic outgrowth as a possibility, he finally had to i9 Veblen, The Place of Science . . . (cited above) p. 355. Veblen became really nonsensical when he averred that socialism could be expected to develop among delicho-blonds because "they are perceptibly more efficient, more readily inclined to think in materialistic terms, more given to radical innovation. . ." Similar statements occur throughout Veblen's work.</page><page sequence="11">VEBLEN AND MARX 109 confess that dynastic and business politics might nevertheless win out. IV In The Nature of Peace and the Terms of its Perpetuation, Veblen was hard put to it to explain the continued prevalence of such an untoward habit as war. He did so by dismissing it as an instinct. That this does violence to technological determinism is obvious, for clearly, from such a viewpoint, some causal agent takes primacy over the state of the industrial arts. A quality of human nature exists - ubiquitous, intimate, and ineradicable - prior to technology. The admission of this fact contradicts Veblen's most basic argument. In attempting to explain the riddle Veblen stated that the patriotic animus is an enduring trait, an ancient heritage that has stood ever since time immemorial. The level of its ardor seems to be no lower today than it ever was. The fact of unreflecting allegiance remains and is to be seen everywhere. It is an endow- ment of the race based upon "a concatenation of several impul- sive propensities." 20 Any special mode or amplitude of response is a product of conventionalized use but the thing itself is innate. A sentimental attachment to habitat, the love of home, coupled with a gregarious and exclusivistic bent, is of its essence. So are abnegation and self-abasement, which go with it to make the bearer unquestioningly accept prescriptive ideals. Patriotism, then, is a constant manifesting itself in one or another variable. It is part of our racial complexion which has not changed since prehistoric times. But it is now a great impediment. Does that mean that patriotism will be eliminated? Not at all, Veblen replied in effect, not even if its continuance incapacitates the species for further habitation on earth. "It is to be noted, there- fore, that the fact of their having successfully come through the long ages of pre-history by the use of this mental and spiritual endowment cannot be taken to argue that these peoples are 20 Veblen, The Nature of Peace . . . (New York 1917) p. 46.</page><page sequence="12">no SOCIAL RESEARCH thereby fit to meet the exigencies of this later gravely altered age." 21 Thus, at this juncture where Veblen is most flagrantly incon- sistent, he completely transcends Marxism. No devotee of Marx could, to begin with, have categorized patriotism as a part of the substructure, which is really what Veblen did. Or, assuming that he and the Marxists could agree on this point, there would remain the future. Veblen could, and intermittently did, look at it bleakly, while the Marxist is shackled to an optimism that daily grows more indefensible. In so far as he escaped the deleterious romanticism of Marx - and in this case it is a total escape - Veblen ascended to a much higher rank as thinker and prophet. But Veblen was afflicted with ambivalence, and even in this book reverted occasionally to the other phase of his temperament. It is impossible to believe with any logical consistency that war is simply foisted upon the people by businessmen who profit from it and, at the same time, that war is the result of patriotism which cannot be exorcised from the psyche. Yet Veblen alternately defended both points of view, and his gloom seems justifiable to us, irrespective of how soundly he has analyzed the total pattern. We are rightly apprehensive of what for the first time is con- ceivable - race suicide. It is to Veblen's everlasting credit that he had some realization of what destiny held in store for us. Veblen saw aright that Germany and Japan were bound to unite and that a league of nations composed of sovereign states would surely be rent with dissension. In the twenties he favored a hard peace and the expropriation of German and Allied colonial hold- ings, including the British, in order to end dynastic aggrandize- ment everywhere. Such were the minimal conditions for a temporary peace. We know only too well how they were not fulfilled. Veblen entertained no expectation that common sense would triumph in this situation. Or rather, he oscillated, and finally expressed his uncertainty whether the musty institutions of property, the price system, and nationalism would be disestab- 21 Ibid., p. 49.</page><page sequence="13">VEBLEN AND MARX 111 lished or not. He was sure that we could rid ourselves of them only with damage, discomfort, and shame. But the alternative is even worse. Thus we are caught up in our own fate. v The Higher Learning is Veblen's fiercest work. Its premise is that our schools are in a perilous state. The college president, Veblen pointed out, is, like the self-made man, a purely Ameri- can phenomenon. On the whole, conditions are worse here than in Europe where American intellectuals must go to study or remain untutored. The university has been so fully transformed that it is now a business concern dealing in standardized erudi- tion.22 Its president is most conscientious in performing the duties with which he is charged by the powers to whom he must remain accountable. His underlings are obedient or they lose out. Very little criticism is tolerated. The president himself acts as the servant of class conviction and popular sentiment, and his security depends upon how flexibly he responds to such pres- sures. He cannot discountenance the admission of what Veblen terms the genteel contingent, a group whose members do not even pretend to seek knowledge. After "the due term of resi- dence at some reputable university, with the collegiate degree certifying honorable discharge," 23 they are afforded the proper accouterment for entering society. These and their like have to be accommodated, so blameless ways and means of dissipation are contrived. Sports come into prominence; fraternities, clubs, and exhibitions multiply; and a coercive plan of itemized instruction is constructed so as to deal with the adolescent mind. Thus a massive organization of departments, schedules, and accountancy is what absorbs the executive head of any large university. The 22 Max Weber echoed these sentiments when he said: "The American's concep- tion of the teacher who faces him is: he sells me his knowledge and his methods for my father's money, just as a greengrocer sells my mother cabbage. And that is all. To be sure, if the teacher happens to be a football coach, then in this field, he is a leader. . ." (op. cit., p. 149) . 23 Veblen, The Higher Learning . . .

Instead of con- centration on synthesis there is much interdepartmental rivalry, for allocations of money are often contingent upon the number of students attracted. Every appeal must be made to the lowest common denominator. In such an atmosphere the scholar cannot breathe, and few men have come as close to suffocation as Veblen, who was tossed from one unappreciative institution to another. His was a single- minded devotion to the search for truth. He could not very well abide the sideshows, the college spirit, the opulent accessories that surrounded and, for most of his life, hid him from those who would have benefited most by his teachings. While he went unheeded, athletes were being apotheosized, and Veblen's aver- sion for them was boundless. Yet, and what is most crucial, we are in an advanced state of technology. If there were but one irreducible cause that shaped the social situation, our universities would be much better than those of Europe, and they would inevitably improve. In point of fact, however, the movement is toward a complete abandonment of reason in education. Veblen hoped that some palliatives would help. For instance, retreats or shelters could be established for the prosecution of scholarly inquiry in some sort of academic quarantine. But these establishments would have to renounce instruction and surrender the university ideal. As Veblen put it, "a seminary of higher learning, as distinct from an assemblage of vocational schools, is not a practicable proposition in America under current conditions/' 24 And current conditions stand every chance of prevailing or deteriorating for an incalculable period of time. Thus Veblen described the social complex in which simultaneity is granted to a rationalism which is minimal and an irrationalism which is maximal. Veblen would have been the last to deny the importance of technology; he only subordinated it. For this reason The Higher Learning is his tour de force. It demonstrates that although 24 ibid., p. 263.</page><page sequence="15">VEBLEN AND MARX 113 Veblen could use Marxian concepts fruitfully, he was something more or other than a Marxist. Whenever he broke loose from doctrinaire socialism, Veblen was much more of a Freudian than a Marxian philosopher.25 The maturation of Veblen's thought led him to note two forces of roughly equal magnitude, whose coetaneous presence acted first in the promotion of reason and then in its derangement. In this discourse he did not fluctuate between them, but gave each its due with most satisfactory results. Idle Curiosity and the Instinct of Workmanship create Learning. They exert a positive force in the world which is negated by their natural enemy, Business. In capitalizing the symbols of these ideas Veblen virtually hypostatized them. But they serve to point up in an allegorical way the politico-economic world as he conceived it. VI '1 say, the critic must keep out of the region of immediate prac- tice in the political, social, humanitarian sphere if he wants to make a beginning for that more free speculative treatment of things, which may perhaps one day make its benefits felt even in this sphere, but in a natural and thence irresistible manner/* 26 Veblen did not heed this cautious advice and made a few forays into the "real" world. As a contributor to The Dial, he tried to assume a popular tone. But Veblen was not a propa- gandist or a demagogue, and his efforts to reach the common man whom he exalted were futile. Of the two books which have been compiled from these essays, the later is by far the weightier. Though The Vested Interests and the Common Man (New York 1919) is forceful, it is unfortunately a repetitious restatement of Veblenism. Its analogies are so overdrawn that business is simply reduced to blackmail or ransom or any traffic in extortion, whereas 25 See Sigmund Freud, Civilization and its Discontents (New York 1930) , espe- cially Chapter 1, where Freud discusses the regressive or primitive impulses existing within civilization, which correspond psychologically to the sociological concepts projected by Veblen. 26 Matthew Arnold, The Victorian Age (New York 1945) p. 503.</page><page sequence="16">114 SOCIAL RESEARCH the worker is represented as a model of industry and honesty. Here the schism between Veblen and Marx narrows, but it widened again and for good in The Engineers and the Price System (New York 1921). In 1919 Veblen could say, not without justice, that "the com- mon man has won the war and lost his livelihood." There was in that year an acute state of distress, "an altogether unwhole- some pitch of privation, for want of the necessary food, clothing and shelter." 27 Yet it was perfectly clear to Veblen that while so many people were being deprived of the bare necessities, our ability to produce had unquestionably increased. We of this generation have arrived at a comparable state. There were more masses starving in 1946 after the second world war than before it. Little has been done to palliate, and nearly everything has been done to perpetuate, this crisis. After every war there is a grave emergency, which is exceptional to Veblen and the Veblenians only in its magnitude and severity, since the same kind of thing goes on as a matter of course in ordinary times. It is exemplified by the protective tariff - which was totally abhorrent to Veblen from first to last - because its effect is to keep the supply of goods down in order to keep prices up. And, according to Veblen, there will never cease to be deprivation of the many who serve the few so long as plenary discretion in industrial matters remains with those least able to understand them. The financier has final authority and he is seldom anything more than a routine admin- istrator, though he is supposed to direct a technology that has grown into the most diversified, specialized, extensive, and diffi- cult process yet created by man. But the cash nexus is evidently not a strong enough link to bind his concerns with the ones he is called upon to guide. The engineer, Veblen reasoned, is as knowledgeable as the businessman is ignorant. The organization of mechanical power and material resources demands, but never gets, systematic control under the direction of industrial experts, with the result that there is dissension, misdirection, and unem- 27 Veblen, The Vested Interests ... p. 11.</page><page sequence="17">VEBLEN AND MARX 115 ployment. If the responsibility were turned over to a group of skilled technologists these evils would then be considerably less noxious. It is the burden of Veblen's thesis, which reaches a logical culmination in this book, that business is a parasitic superero- gation, and that all those who fall into the merely commercial class may be designated as undesirable. So far, there is nothing incompatible with Marxism. But Veblen did not at all favor the classless society, even if it were to be ushered in by a tem- porary dictatorship of the proletariat. He saw things differently from Marx and his approach merits separate consideration. The choice before us is not simply between Marxian socialism and free enterprise capitalism, although it has seemed that easy to those who have been poisoned by contemporary dogma. Veblen was the first major sociologist to detect an emergent class whose dominance is now de facto and could become de jure as well. When James Burnham expatiated on this subject in The Mana- gerial Revolution (New York 1941) he merely elaborated Veblen's speculations and concluded that no matter how much one might yearn for the socialist utopia there was no prospect of its mate- rialization. That laissez-faire capitalism is dead all except the die-hards agree. But sharp differences exist over what will take its place in the future. Both normatively and descriptively Veblen's stand diverges from Marx's. He not only did not especially want, but he did not in any sense foresee, a classless society. And his negative vision is being borne out all over the world. Society has not ceased to be stratified; it is merely strati- fied in a new way. This is a time that calls for the specialist, the expert, the technician, the engineer. Bureaucratization, not egali- tarianism, is inevitable. Unless man reverts to a preindustrial state of barbarism like that envisaged in Butler's Erewhon, the bureau- crat will rule him. Marx did not even reckon with such a leader except as the transient figure who lived in a kind of hazy prehistory that would presage the socialist dream. In Veblen's work he is the central character. The specialist and his compeers</page><page sequence="18">ii6 SOCIAL RESEARCH are the real General Staff in an industrial army that cannot do without them. In a sense, Veblen stands equidistant between Marx and Weber (whom Albert Salomon has named the "bourgeois Marx"). Weber's view of things is as bleak as Marx's is bright. Veblen's is a combination, but in his best work the Weberian overshadows the Marxian strain. Veblen and Weber have both been vindi- cated, whereas Marx has been refuted by the failure of socialism. Weber stressed the importance of bureaucracy in modern life, and noted the universal rationalization of society that was taking place, as well as the depersonalization and routinization that went with it. In this he and Veblen had a strong kinship. They broke with sociologism and proclaimed that conditions were more portentous than the positivistic optimist could imagine. It is typical of Veblen that his "constructive" ideas should have been compressed into one brief chapter entitled "A Memo- randum on a Practical Soviet of Technicians." The suggestions are hypothetical. They are not "to the engineers what the Communist Manifesto purported to be for the proletariat," despite the dust jacket claims. This was the construction popularly put on the book, and when Veblen's proposals had been sufficiently distorted, they led to Technocracy. But Veblen himself did not believe that a forcible dispossession of the capitalists would take place. He thought that they might one day reluctantly but voluntarily abdicate their positions of supremacy. Then an industrial directorate could be formed with a large ramification of subcenters and local councils, whose main duty would be to avoid "all unemployment of serviceable equipment and man- power on the one hand, and all local and seasonal scarcity on the other." 28 Veblen advised the board to make full use of con- sulting economists who would occupy a place analogous to that of legal counsel among diplomats and statesman. This plan could only hope to succeed if it rigidly excluded businessmen from all positions of trust. There is the stumbling 28 Veblen, The Engineers and the Price System, p. 144.</page><page sequence="19">VEBLEN AND MARX 117 block. The American public is beguiled into trusting no group but one composed of businessmen - the very ones and the only ones Veblen deemed completely unqualified. If there were a great deal of cooperation between engineers and economists, one could be more hopeful, but actually, teamwork has been lacking, and there is no reason to anticipate a reversal so great that it will provoke the abandonment of absentee ownership. The revo- lution could be accomplished peacefully, but Veblen doubted that it would be accomplished at all. By themselves the tech- nicians might effectually incapacitate the country's industry and take it over. But without the tolerant consent of public opinion, backed by aggressive support from below, they would be vir- tually helpless to institute an organization on the new footing. Veblen summarized his viewpoint: "There is nothing in the situation that should reasonably flutter the sensibility of the Guardians or of that massive body of well-to-do citizens who make up the rank and file of absentee owners just yet." 29 It appears then that Thorstein Veblen was a thinker in his own right, related to, but only partly dependent upon, Marx. His class concepts resemble those of Marxian sociology in some respects, but they differ in even more significant ones. Primarily, Veblen wavered in the application of technological determinism, and the doubt he thus revealed is an accurate measure of his success. 20 Ibid., p. 169. (New York City)</page></plain_text>
