Recent archaeological explorations by the Regional Archaeological Investigation of the North Peten, Guatemala (RAINPEG) project at the site of Nakbe, Peten, have discovered codex-style ceramics in archaeological context. The hieroglyphs and painted scenes on the ceramics demonstrate the authenticity of the art style. Neutron activation analyses of the ceramics indicate that subtle differences in the ceramic corpus can be detected between proximal sites such as El Mirador and Nakbe. These data also indicate that codex-style ceramics were not manufactured in a site-specific workshop, but originate in a variety of production areas. While most codex-style vessels appear to have been manufactured within the immediate area of the extreme north-central Peten, several codex-style vessels that depict scribes are consistently similar in chemical composition to the codex-style pottery from Nakbe. The presence of fine painted codex-style pottery from modest plaza groups suggests a wider distribution of high-quality ceramic artifacts from among varied levels of economic, social, and political status of ancient Maya society. This accounts for the extensive looting of low-housemound complexes throughout the northern Peten. Recent advances in Maya epigraphy and iconography have cre ated a flurry of important studies of Maya art and artifacts found in private and public collections throughout the world, allowing the compilation of a broad corpus of materials for study (e.g., Coe 1973, 1978; Coe and Kerr 1982; Robicsek and Hales 1981; Scheie and Miller 1986). The vast majority of the pieces are, unfortunately, plundered and without provenience, including the spectacular groups of polychrome ceramics known as "codex-style" or "codex vessels" (e.g., Coe 1973:91-103, 1978:1-51; Coe and Kerr 1982:102-107; Robicsek and Hales 1981). The lack of context for the pottery has caused some Mayanists to assume that the vessels were forgeries. Excavations and salvage operations at the site of Nakbe, Peten, Guatemala, have recovered codex-style ceramics in situ, providing the first evidence for possible sources for the pottery. INTRODUCTION TO CODEX-STYLE POTTERY The term "codex-style ceramics" is a diagnostic description of elaborately painted ceramic vessels originally suggested by Coe to have been copied from a Maya codex (Coe 1973:91, 1978:16, 46; see also Robicsek and Hales 1981, 1988). Technically, the pottery is assigned to the type group known as Zacatal Cream polychrome.1 The surface decoration of these ceramics consists of a black or dark brown monochrome line painting on a light brown or cream background with red or black rims and basal bands (Forsyth 1989a: 112-114; Smith and Gifford 1966:164, 172). On rare occasions, however, the texts and scenes are re corded in a fine red-line painting. On many vessels where the design is on the exterior, the interior is slipped a dull orange color, similar to the Palmar Ceramic Group (Palmar Orange polychrome) vessels. The dark-colored lines that form the scenes and glyphs are accentuated by the varying thicknesses and in tensity that provide sufficient artistic and stylistic detail to iden tify specific scribes or "schools" responsible for the work (Coe 1973, 1975; Kerr and Kerr 1988; Robicsek and Hales 1981: 237ff.). Codex vessels are found in a variety of forms (see Ro bicsek and Hales 1981:4, for examples of the range), but the most common forms consist of plates, bowls, and cylinder vases. Regrettably, the provenience of these most exquisite of Maya pictorial ceramics has remained elusive, because of the failure to recover the vessels in archaeological context. The numerous codex-style vessels that have been published have been looted. Several papers have attempted to locate the source of the ceram ics based on artistic style (Kerr and Kerr 1988; Robicsek and Hales 1981:236), paste composition, and form (Reents and Bishop 1987). Bishop and others (1985a: 159) note that codex style pottery may have been produced at a site "not too far north of Uaxactun," while Coe (1978:28) suggests that the ves sels originated at Calakmul or related sites because of the pres ence of the Calakmul emblem glyph on one of the vessels. Robicsek and Hales (1981:236) and others (Nicholas Hellmuth, personal communication, 1982) propose that the vessels of "Codex-style Site A" were from somewhere "north of Carmelita 'The previous published type designations are Zacatel Cream-poly chrome, although the grammatically correct term is Zacatal. While the naming of types is completely at the discretion of the associated scholar, it is felt by both Donald Forsyth and Richard Hansen that the minor nature of the change to Zacatal Cream-polychrome will maintain type name consistency and not continue to perpetuate an error. 225</page><page sequence="2">226 Hansen, Bishop, and Fahsen IATEMALAI "PelaEinV 0fTaacKlun' (Li Muralla Nakb* El Mlrador • Poi»«nli® Ptoy# g TlntalA m 9 Gulro Guatemala City y Carmallla Uaxactun GUATEMALA Figure 1.

On the basis of chemical trace-element analyses, Reents and Bishop (1987) suggest that the source of codex-style vessels was the El Mirador-Pacaya region (Figure 1). A handful of codex style sherds was recovered mostly from a single looter's trench at El Mirador (Forsyth 1989a: 110—114; Matheny, Hansen, and Gurr 1980:8) and analyzed by neutron activation (Bishop 1984:104), indicating a general, acceptable compositional pro file of the codex materials (Reents and Bishop 1987). However, in spite of the chemical similarities, it is apparent that El Mirador and its immediate environs were not a major source of the ceramics because of the fact that a minimal number of looters' trenches (approximately 70) were placed throughout the site area by 1983.2 Many of the codex-style pots are known to have entered private collections prior to that date (e.g., Coe 1973:90-103). Furthermore, many of the 70 looters' trenches at El Mirador did not locate tombs because excavations penetrated tabulation of looters' trenches was undertaken by Project El Mirador during the 1978-1983 field seasons. No new looters' trenches were placed within the site center during this time.</page><page sequence="3">Haya codex-style ceramics 227 Preclassic architecture, which is unlikely to contain Late Clas sic materials. Several codex-style sherds had been recovered in 1983 and in 1987 from the Late Classic settlement around a chi cle camp called La Muerta, found to the immediate southwest of El Mirador (Hansen 1991b), but the number of looters' trenches was insufficient to account for the large numbers of known codex vessels prior to 1979. Large sites such as Tintal, located between Carmelita and EI Mirador, have been looted for several decades and may have been a possible source of codex-style polychromes. However, Hansen failed to locate codex-style sherds in the looters' back dirt throughout the site, and discussions with the inhabitants of Carmelita have indicated that "lo bueno" (the good stuff) was not as abundant at Tintal as in other sites. On the other hand, the site of Porvenir, located between El Mirador and Tintal, was reported to have been a rich source of extremely fine Late Classic pottery; a brief surface reconnaissance of Porvenir in 1979 by Hansen and Gareth Lowe indicated that the site, con sisting mainly of mound groups from 1-m to 3-m high, had been completely looted by that time. It is likely, on the basis of chemical composition, chiclero reports, and extensive looting at the site, that Porvenir was a source of codex-style ceramics. Future archaeological investigations in this badly looted site may help settle the issue. Approximately 21 km east-northeast of El Mirador is the site of Naachtun, which abounds in Late Classic stelae, an un common phenomenon in the extreme north-central Peten. This large site, having been severely looted during the late 1960s and early 1970s, suggests another possible source for the ceramics. However, no codex-style ceramics have been recovered at nearby Rio Azul (R. E. W. Adams, Fred Valdez, personal com munication, 1990), nor at Calakmul (Hansen, personal obser vation; Folan, personal communication, 1990), and further identification of Naachtun as a source must await future inves tigations. Published speculations that codex ceramics come from the vicinity of the site of El Peru on the San Pedro Mártir River in the western Peten (Robicsek and Hales 1981:235) do not seem plausible. Ian Graham (personal communication, 1990) notes that no codex-style ceramics have been observed in any of the looters' trenches within the site proper. But discussions with workers and natives in Carmelita during the 1990 field investi gations of the Regional Archaeological Investigation of North Peten, Guatemala (RAINPEG), indicate another possible source of the ceramics. Fine codex-style vessels, dubbed "lo mejor" (the best) or "lo bueno" (the good) have also been re ported as coming from the site called "Lagartero," which is lo cated near Paixban, on the border with Mexico directly north of Carmelita. In fact, the site is reported to be slightly north of the border, and the ruins continue to be worked by the inhab itants of Carmelita, thus avoiding possible capture or confisca tion by Mexican authorities. NAKBE Recent extensive RAINPEG excavations at the site of Nakbe in north-central Peten, Guatemala (Figure 1), provide information to identify a large Middle Preclassic occupation (1000-400 b.c.) within the major architectural groups at the site center (Forsyth 1989b,1990; Hansen 1989b,1990a,1990b,1991a). However, a large number of smaller quadrilateral or trilateral mound groups that are found in the periphery of the site appear to date primarily to the Late Classic period, as determined by ceram ics recovered from large numbers of looters' excavations (see Figure 2). In 1987, the first UCLA RAINPEG expedition to Nakbe located abundant codex-style sherds in a series of looted architectural compounds known as the "Grupo Códice" or "Co dex Group," located approximately 400 m to the northwest of Structure 1 (Figures 2 and 3) (Hansen 1987a, 1987b, 1989a:209; López 1990). During the 1989 RAINPEG investigations, it be came evident that the looting effort had employed a large num ber of workers since mules had been used to sustain the looters' camp (located approximately 850 m northwest of Structure 27), and a large number of sleeping platforms had been built in the huts or champas} Staff members Richard Wigle and Frederick Hillman recovered the fragments of a partially complete codex vessel near fresh looters' trenches close to the Grupo Códice. This vessel, in addition to the codex ceramics collected by ar chaeologist Francisco R. López (Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala) from the Grupo Códice in 1989 and 1990 (Figure 4), indicates the considerable quantity, variety, and quality of the codex-style ceramics that must have been obtained by looters from the peripheral settlements of Nakbe. Nakbe Codex Scribe Vessel The Nakbe Codex Scribe Vessel 1 (Figures 5 and 6) is an incom plete cylinder vase measuring 21.8-cm high and 15.4-cm wide, with a paste thickness of 0.5 cm. Red rim and basal bands (Munsell color 10 R 4/8 to 5/8) frame the vessel. Immediately below the red rim band are two parallel black lines followed by a third, lighter "scribe line" (a line which is included to appar ently contain the glyphs) forming the upper frame of the glyph band. The text consists of glyphs 1.9-cm high, which are sep arated from the scene(s) of the vessel by three, similar parallel black lines. The black-line text and scenes are painted on a cream-slipped background (Munsell 10 YR 7/3 to 7/4; very pale brown). The scene represented on the sides of the vase consists of two scribes, sitting in the usual Maya crossed-leg position; their left hands supporting jaguar pelt-bound codices, and their right arms extended, with the hands pointing down to the co dex (Figures 5 and 6). The upper torso of one of the scribes is missing, but the intact figure shows a water lilly-with-ahaw (the cartouche representing the day name ahaw and meaning "Lord") headdress and an extended deer's ear attached. To the sides of the headdress are the descending feathers (quetzal?) from the unseen portion of the headdress, which is hidden be neath the hieroglyphic text. The double-spotted akbal elements (symbols for the day name and meaning "night") are located in the usual positions of the ears, shoulders, backs, and thighs of 3The preferred methods of looting appear to involve relatively small numbers of men who carry most of their necessary provisions on tumpline backpacks. The presence of mules implies a greater number of looters since mules normally are rented out at a premium price dur ing chicle and shate (xate) seasons. If mules are used, then the number of looters must be increased to justify the increased expense. Also, the amount of provisions that can be brought in and the amount of looted vessels that can be exported are much greater. Mules, however, imply less security for the looters, since their presence can be detected much easier.</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. Field map of the Grupo Códice, Nakbe, made by F. R.

The "print-out tree" or "computer tape" (jargon for the flowering plantlike appendage) emerges from beneath the left arms of the scribes, with the associated bars and dots com mon on this particular feature. An elongated strawlike element extends down along the cheek to below the chin, perhaps rep resenting the "shell beard" commonly associated with the scribes, or part of the ear-flare assemblage. The Nakbe codex scribe vase is nearly identical to Robicsek and Hales' Vessel 62 (1981:55), and because of the minute de tails indicated in the hands, headdresses, and torsos, was prob ably painted by the same artist. David Stuart (personal communication) has pointed out that the same artist also prob ably painted Robicsek and Hales' Vessel 63. An interesting vari ation is noted, however, in that both scribes of the Nakbe vessel are carefully featured with seven toes. This oddity is perhaps a subtle reference either to the supernatural context of the scene or possibly to a less likely personification of, or reference to, G-III of the Palenque Triad. G-III, as the Jaguar God of the Underworld was the patron of the number seven. It is a fact that Classic rulers often impersonated G-III, as did Yaxkin at Tikal who had the number seven portrayed on his cheeks (Coe and Shook 1961 :Fig. 27). The identification of the scribes can be attributed to Coe (Coe 1977; Coe and Kerr 1982:63) who first suggested that they represented Hun Chuen and Hun Batz, the older half brothers of the Hero Twins of the Popol Vuh, who were tricked and transformed into monkeys by the Hero Twins (Coe 1977:328— 329; Tedlock 1985:120-124). Hun Chuen and Hun Batz became the "patron gods of musicians, singers, painters ('ah tz'ib, he of the writing'), and sculptors" (Coe 1977:329). Evidence of the correct identification of the scribes is present in the free substi tution of the "Print-out Gods" with monkey scribes (e.g., Robicsek and Hales 1981 ¡Vessels 64, 66, and 67; Scheie and Miller 1986:P1. 44a). Text. Coe's (1973) identification of the standardized and co herent order of texts on vessels (Primary Standard Sequence, hereafter PSS), led him to suggest that the glyphs were related to underworld or funerary connotations (Coe 1973:18). How ever, we now know that these texts contain a sequence that identifies the nature of the vessel and its function. The text also contains names, either the name of the individual who painted it or of the owner of the vessel or both (Houston, Stuart, and Taube 1989; Stuart 1989). A peculiarity in most of the known vessels depicting the scribes is the absence of the PSS or other secondary texts. How ever, the surviving text on the rim of the Nakbe codex vessel consists of seven complete glyph blocks and a partially de stroyed eighth block. The two glyphs to the left and above the complete scribe are part of the PSS, while the latter five con stitute titles and nomináis. The first visible glyph at position E is the so-called Serpent Segment transcribed as T61:565a (yu ta). It probably had a ft or ta preposition prefix, introducing the prepositional phrase that describes the use of the vessel (Stuart 1986). The next glyph at F is "Fish" T738.?:130 variant(?), or (,kakaw). Both constitute part of the last glyph sequence of the PSS as described by Coe (1973), Stuart (1986), and Grube (1986), and describe the use, or at least the contents, of the vessel. The following set of glyphs at G begins with T679, its'at, here written in the reverse order and translated as "artisan," "painter," or "learned one" (Stuart 1989); it shows that a nom inal alluding to the person who painted the text will follow. This nominal at H begins with the expression T177.507 with a spot</page><page sequence="7">Maya codex-style ceramics 231 Figure 5. Nakbe Scribe Vessel 1. (Photo by R. D. Hansen.) Figure 6. Drawing of the codex-style scribe vessel by Jody Hansen. ted kan head variant that is interpreted as pi-tzi (Stuart 1987), probably meaning "ball player" or an equivalent title. The high status of this person is highlighted by the expres sion T40:1016 (I), which has been related to "blood" or "royal blood" and which more recently has been translated as "re vered," "holy," or "sacred" (Ringle 1988:11). The name at J be gins with what appears to be T59 prefixed to a zoomorphic head variant glyph. There are at least three significant elements in the head, specifically the hook eye, the lolling tongue, and the birdlike nose and upper mandible. Although this is an un</page><page sequence="8">232 Hansen, Bishop, and Fahsen known glyph, it could prove to be a vulture variant. In any case, the T59 prefix is probably read ti with the zoomorphic head, and is possibly an equivalent to the title ahaw. The last complete glyph block at K is badly eroded, but the size of the block suggests that the nominal possibly consists of two zoomorphic heads, evidenced by the old spotted jaguar face forming the left cartouche and a zoomorphic ear forming the right. The last glyph block (L) is destroyed and beyond inter pretation at this point. It is apparent that the text must have included some four or five additional glyphs, followed by the titles and name of the artisan or owner of the vessel. Additional Codex-style Fragments The predominance of codex-style vessels in the Nakbe periph eral region is characterized by a variety of vessel forms and by the number of fragments, some with PSS texts (Figures 7,8, and 9) recovered from looters' excavations. Vessel forms iden tified to date range from wide plates (Figures 7 and 8b), bowls (Figures 9a and 9c), restricted-neck jars, and cylinder vases. Considerable variation in sizes of cylinder vases is shown by rim diameters ranging from 12 cm to 30 cm. The largest fragment to date with the 30-cm diameter also has a paste thickness of 1.1 cm and an eroded glyph band 6.5-cm high. Most rim sherds and bases are found with red rim and basal bands, and the cream background ranges from light yellowish brown (Munsell 10 YR 6/4) and light brown (7.5 YR 6/4) to white (10 YR 8/2). Two large rim sherds, a plate, and cylinder vessel, were painted in a negative image, that is with images outlined by a positive painted black background (Figures 10a and 10b). The scenes represented in the recovered fragments from Nakbe coincide well with the themes represented in the codex style ceramics analyzed previously (e.g., Coe 1973, 1978; Robic sek and Hales 1981).4 Such scenes range from human depictions (Figure 10c) to zoomorphic scenes such as a seated deer possibly being decapitated next to an adjacent bee or fly (Figure 11a). In addition, turtle carapaces (Figure lib) and jaguars (Fig ures lOd through lOg) are depicted. Deity and mythological forms (Figures 10c, lOd, and lOe) are also common, such as the profile monster face (Tlaloc?) on the interior base of a ring based bowl or plate (Figure 11c), a face which has also appeared on numerous vessels in private collections (Robicsek and Hales 1981:215-217). One unusual fragment depicts an upward looking Maya figure with two floating God K images located above him. The God K representation immediately above the head apparently emerges from an ahaw glyph, while a T539 glyph, read way (Houston and Stuart 1989) is visible in the up per left-hand portion of the fragment (Figure llf). It is apparent by the variety of stylistic modes used to dis tinguish separate scribes and artists (e.g., Kerr and Kerr 1988) that a number of artists are represented in the Nakbe materials recovered to date, as suggested, for example, by the difference between the Nakbe Codex Scribe Vase and the cylinder frag ment (Figure 10c) found near the Nakbe looters' camp. It is possible that the variations in artistic form may also represent a chronological variation, although we believe that, if this were the case, the temporal difference would be slight. More refined ceramic variations will be forthcoming from detailed ceramic analyses and associated chronometric evaluations of material obtained in archaeological context. NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSES The approach to ascertaining whether Nakbe was a production center for codex-style vessels, or for the scribe vase in particu lar, is through comparison of the elemental constituents of the ceramic paste to other ceramics thought to be locally produced or to the region's available clays. Fortunately, the Nakbe spec imens' paste composition could be compared to the more than one hundred specimens that have been analyzed previously as part of a large project of Late Classic Maya ceramic production and distribution. Regrettably, almost all of the previously an alyzed specimens lacked provenience. In the previous investiga tions of sources for codex-style pottery containing carbonate temper (Bishop et al. 1985a, 1985b; Reents and Bishop 1987; Robicsek and Hales 1981:239-342), groups of sampled pottery demonstrating relatively similar composition were interpreted to represent multiple sources of production within a limited re gion of the northern Peten. Further, the presence of composi tionally "matching" codex-style pottery of known provenience, that, in part, constituted the derived groups, was coupled to in ferences of the extent of chemical variation in the regional clays to derive a "best guess" of the location of production for codex style pottery: namely, a region north and northwest of Uaxac tun and south of El Mirador. It is against these previous analyses that the compositional data for the Nakbe codex-style pottery are compared in an effort to obtain information to cir cumscribe more narrowly the production location(s) for the pottery. Instrumental neutron activation analysis was employed to determine various major, minor, and trace elements in the ce ramic paste. Discussion of the general analytical approach is de tailed elsewhere (Bishop, Harbottle, and Sayre 1982; Bishop et al. 1985c; Harbottle 1976; Perlman and Asaro 1969). The tech nique is of great sensitivity for many elements, some of which occur only in the parts-per-million (and even less) range. The range of detected elements can often be differentiated among pottery made from different clay sources within a small geo graphical region, and the technique itself can be used in a way that is minimally destructive (Bishop et al. 1990). The specific analytical procedures, including the combination of data assem bled at Brookhaven National Laboratory with that of the Nakbe pottery analyzed at the Conservation Analytical Labora tory's facilities will be presented in the future, in a more com prehensive discussion of codex-style pottery production. In this article, we consider only briefly the compositional variation of the Nakbe codex-style ceramics and the recovered Nakbe codex scribe vessel relative to the other codex-style pottery analyzed thus far. 4Kerr and Kerr (1988) have argued persuasively that drawings of vase rollouts introduce another bias to the original artist's work. How ever, in the absence of rollout camera equipment, we have discovered another alternative to ensuring the accuracy of drawings. Whole ves sels, particularly cylinder vases, may be reliably reproduced in rollout form with a photocopy machine that has a stationary top, but a slid ing, slow-moving undercarriage. Sherds and certain shallow whole ves sels may be photocopied with only a minimum of distortion in the reproduction.</page><page sequence="9">Figure 7. Codex-style plates, Nakbe.

Concentration data for the alkalies (Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ba) were omitted for this sum mary because of the probability that these elements underwent postuse enrichment or dilution in the ground waters of this tropical environment (see Bishop 1980). A Q-mode factor analysis of logged concentrations (Harbot tle 1976) was carried out, since this approach has provided a convenient way in which to see the variation expressed among the samples by using a measure of proportional similarity (Bishop 1980; Klovan and Imbrie 1971), an approach that can compensate for the addition of variable amounts of carbonates that were likely added as temper. Three factors were extracted that accounted for 98% of the variation among the samples. The samples are shown in a ternary diagram (Figure 12) rela tive to their derived factor loading, and symbols have been used to draw attention to certain ceramic classes. Within the perspective afforded by previous investigations of codex pottery, the samples shown in the plot probably repre sent paste variation within a fairly restricted area of the northern Peten. Within that body of material, however, exists a consid erable amount of compositional variation. This variation may be the result of similar, although different, clay sources, vari able amounts of carbonate temper, different sources for the temper, or a combination of these factors among others. A straight line has been placed diagonally on the plot (Figure 12) to illustrate the separation of the Nakbe codex-style pottery from the majority of the other analyzed codex specimens. Even among the Nakbe provenienced specimens, possibly as many as three compositional "clusters" may be inferred as one proceeds from the B-apex to the middle right of the plot. Other groups shown with a distinguishing symbol are the ceramics analyzed from Pacaya, El Mirador, and the large corpus of nonprove nienced specimens. Interestingly, the single clay sample from Nakbe has a high calcium abundance that indicates a carbonate content that is in the range of the carbonate-tempered pottery. Relative to the factor axes, the clay analysis clusters near the B apex, and in the general vicinity of Nakbe codex vessels and two or perhaps four of the eight previously analyzed vessels that have themes dis playing scribes. However, vessels with scribe themes are repre sented in several locations in the plot, and the distribution strongly suggests that no one particular workshop was respon sible for the manufacture of these vessels. (This observation was noted among the chemically analyzed scribe vessels 56, 57, 58,</page><page sequence="15">Maya codex-style ceramics 239 59, 61, 66, 67, 69, and 70 in the Robicsek and Hales volume.) The Nakbe Codex Scribe Vessel 1 is situated near the C-apex of the plot and strongly divergent from the other scribe vessels, and more generally from the entire group of analyzed codex style vessels. Chemical variation among the codex-style carbonate-con taining specimens can be summarized as follows: Multiple re sources within a region of the northern Peten were exploited to produce the codex vessels. The representation of scribes occurs on vessels that are diverse compositionally and thus a "highly restricted" or "workshop" organization of production is not im plied. However, this says nothing about who or what group may have been responsible for painting the vessels. Compared to earlier investigations, the distribution of the Nakbe codex style specimens suggests yet additional loci of production, some of which are similar to some of the codex-style pottery from Pacaya. The paste composition of some of the specimens is sim ilar to the analyzed clay sample and may well indicate local pro duction of codex-style pottery at Nakbe. Vessels with scribe themes are similar to Nakbe pottery, but not to the codex scribe vessel discussed in this article. The high similarity of the theme and figures of the Nakbe scribe vessel with Vessel 62 illustrated by Robicsek and Hales (1981:55) is exceptional. Unfortunately, we have no composi tional data for this stylistically comparable specimen, and thus we are left with the unsatisfying observation that the Nakbe scribe vessel is unusual in its composition. Does the paste com position of this codex-style vessel represent the use of source materials considerably distant from Nakbe, or is it just beyond the compositional limits we have described so far? Or does it perhaps represent an example of idiosyncratic variation that can often be associated with examples of artistic excellence? Were some of the Nakbe codex-style vessels imported from another undiagnosed source? A present, we cannot answer these ques tions, but we hope to do so as more analyses from Nakbe and other sites in the RAINPEG region become available. CONTEXTUAL IMPLICATIONS It has long been assumed and demonstrated that high-quality pictorial Maya ceramics came from elite status tombs, such as those in large Late Classic pyramids generally associated with royalty. This idea has been questioned by Chase (1985:201) on the basis of excavations at Tayasal and is further disputed here based on observations of archaeological and looters' excava tions in the northern Peten. It is a well-known fact that since the early 1970s, looting in the Peten has been occurring in epidemic proportions. As a re sult, many minor and major sites, such as the poorly known site of Tintal found to the north of Carmelita, have been system atically and completely devastated by the placement of trenches through Maya structures. The most common form of looting in the northern Peten, however, involves the excavation of "los caballos" (the horses), which are low (1-m to 2-m high) rectan gular or three-sided mound groups, with a single trench that runs perpendicular to the axis of the mound. Excavations are most commonly placed in "la montura" (the saddle), which is a slight slump in the mound profile and usually indicates the en trance into the structure. The low housemounds found through Figure 13. Photograph of common Late Classic burials below the floor in a looted mound in the Grupo Códice, Nakbe (L-81), but placed in a more unusual way. The burials were placed in the fill of the structure below the plaster floor with the upper burial chamber situated directly on the cap stones of the lower burial. (Photo by R. D. Hansen.) out the northern Peten are the preferred structures for looting because of the relative ease and speed with which burials can be located. Larger pyramids prove much more difficult, time con suming, labor intensive and have a greater risk of failure in lo cating the tomb.5 Consistent with Bishop Landa's observations (Landa 1941:130), Late Classic Maya burials are commonly located be tween or below the plaster floors of the smaller structures. These burials usually consist of low, slab-lined tombs that are covered by a series of capstones, forming a rectangular box shaped cist roughly the length and width of the deceased (Fig ure 13). In addition, contrary to accepted wisdom, the reported quality of the ceramics exhumed from the burials is not neces sarily related to the size or sophistication of the structure, an idea alluded to earlier by Chase (1985). Although large struc tures almost invariably yielded quality artifacts, such as elab orately painted polychrome plates and cylinder vases, jade artifacts, carved bone and shell artifacts, and elaborate obsid ian and chert implements, small structures yielded high-quality artifacts as well, albeit less frequently. Years of discussions with workers who knew of looting stategies indicate, however, that it required excavation of approximately 10 to 20 mounds before 5The north-central Peten has many large Preclassic structures that have frustrated looters because of their failure to locate tombs in those areas normally associated with Late Classic burial patterns. Large illicit excavations of Preclassic structures in areas that are normally produc tive, such as the centerline basal axis, flint and obsidian flake deposits in architecture or immediately under floors of upper rooms in major structures, are commonly futile. Often, the looters place multiple trenches in major Preclassic architecture because of the apparent belief that the tomb was missed. As a result, Preclassic structures that have been excavated by looters usually show more extensive damage to the architecture than Classic structures, where tombs or burials are quickly and precisely located with a single trench.</page><page sequence="16">240 Hansen, Bishop, and Fahsen Figure 14. Profile drawing of the looters' excavation L-74 in the Grupo Códice, Nakbe (from López 1990). Note the burial con structions below the floors. a "bueno-bueno" (good-good) vessel was acquired, suggesting that the ceramics of greatest value to collectors were distributed more sparingly in the smaller mounds. This fact accounts for the high number of looters' trenches on small mounds through out the northern Peten. Nearly all burials in small mounds 1-m high or larger had ce ramics, and often polychrome plates, cylinder vases, or both in cluded in the mortuary furniture.6 A major difference between "los caballos" and the larger pyramidal structures was that jade artifacts and other exotic imports such as shell or obsidian ar tifacts were seldom recovered from the low-domiciliary construc tions and were much more prevalent in pyramidal structures. The factors that account for the variations in mortuary furni ture in mounds of similar size and form are important in under standing Lowland Maya social and economic systems, and they may be explained through more anthropologically oriented, de tailed archaeological excavation. At Nakbe, codex-style fragments have been associated with mound groups from 1 m to 4 m in height. In the case of the Grupo Códice, the elite status of the constructions is verified by the presence of vaulted structures (Figure 14), detailed masonry constructions (Figure 15), and cist burials placed beneath plaster floors (Figures 13 and 14), a pattern consistent with known Late Classic burial practices in the north-central Peten. SUMMARY Recent archaeological investigations at the Lowland Maya site of Nakbe, Peten, Guatemala, have discovered an abundance of 6Excavations conducted by RAINPEG archaeologist Francisco Ló pez (University of San Carlos, Guatemala) during the 1990 field season at Nakbe consisted of the complete horizontal exposure of an intact small-mound complex approximately 200 m to the north of the Grupo Códice (López 1990). López located two cist burials below the plaster floors. Despite the elite nature of the architecture (thick, well-built walls, finely carved wall stones, corbeled vaulting, thick plaster floors, painted walls), the ceramics recovered from both burials were monochrome ves sels, and no polychromes or codex-style ceramics were recovered. A mound of similar size (1.0-m high) and form at the site of La Muerta (Hansen 1991b) near El Mirador apparently yielded numerous quality polychrome vessels, evidenced by the fragments located in the looters' backdirt.</page><page sequence="17">Maya codex-style ceramics 241 Figure 15. Looter's trench in the Grupo Códice, Nakbe (L-81). Note the finely carved stones which formed the external wall. (Photo by R. D. Hansen.) codex-style ceramics from extensive looters' excavations in low housemound groups that are located in the peripheral areas of the major architecture at the site. The ceramics are among the first archaeologically recovered samples of codex-style pottery, and the texts and pictorial themes are consistent with other known codex-style vessels. Neutron activation analyses demon strate that the chemical composition of the Nakbe specimens is distinct from other known codex-style ceramics recovered from the immediate region of the north-central Peten, suggesting that the manufacture of codex-style ceramics was not the product of a site-specific workshop, but rather of a multiplicity of produc tion areas. However, a small number of codex-style ceramics in private collections that depict scribes are consistently similar in chemical composition to the Nakbe materials. The identification of codex-style ceramics from smaller mounds at Nakbe and other nearby sites suggests that the qual ity of ceramic artifacts, such as finely painted polychrome plates and cylinder vases, does not necessarily correspond with large structural size or sophistication. This suggests a wider distribu tion of high-quality ceramic artifacts among varied levels of the economic, social, or political levels of Maya society. Although the study of codex-style pottery and its archaeo logical context is still in its infancy at Nakbe and surrounding sites, we hope to define further the distribution, chemical com position, context, and architectural features in association with the ceramics, in the hope that such investigations will allow us to identify the sources and the cultural and ideological functions of codex-style ceramics in ancient Maya society. RESUMEN La cerámica "estilo-códice" es conocida como la más apreciada por saqueadores y coleccionistas del arte maya en el mundo. Esta cerá mica consiste de escenas mitológicas pintadas en línea negra muy fina sobre un cuerpo de color crema, formando dibujos de alta calidad y claridad. Sin embargo, la procedencia de esta cerámica no había sido identificada todavía, aúnque varias publicaciones y catálogos de estos materiales ya existen, mostrando piezas que fueron depredadas o fal sificadas. Excavaciones recientes por el Proyecto Regional de Investigación Ar queológica del Norte del Peten, Guatemala (PRIANPEG) en el sitio ar queológico de Nakbe han logrado recobrar cerámica estilo-códice de contextos arqueológicos. La procedencia de esta cerámica es de entierros sequeadores de los montículos modestos del clásico tardío que forman parte de grupos habitacionales en las zonas periféricas al centro preclá sico de Nakbe. Los jeroglíficos y temas representados en las escenas mitológicas vistas en los tiestos y vasos recobrados demuestran la con sistencia de la cerámica estilo-códice de Nakbe con otros ejemplos ya conocidos. Los análisis químicos de la cerámica de estilo-códice hechos por me dio de activación de neutrones indican que la mayoría de le cerámica códice tiene procedencia del Petén nor-central. Sin embargo, por me dio de la alta tecnología, se puede distinguir la muestra de Nakbe de otros sitios cercanos en la zona inmediata, tales como Pacaya y El Mirador. Por lo tanto, esto indica que la fabricación de la cerámica estilo-códice no fue el producto de un solo taller, sino que fue el resul tado de varios talleres especialistas en varios sitos. El descubrimiento de la cerámica estilo-códice de montículos modestos en Nakbe y en otros sitios cercanos sugiere que la calidad de los muebles funerarios no corresponde necesariamente con el tamaño y la sofisticación arquitectónica. Por lo tanto, se puede inferir que la distribución de la cerámica policromada fue accesible a varios niveles económicos, sociales, y políticos en la sociedad maya.
