<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY OF RADICAL HISTORY I In an affectionate aside on Vico's conception of history, which in our own time might have led Vico himself to a fresh reading of technology, Hannah Arendt observes: In the modern age history emerged as something it never had been before. It was no longer composed of the deeds and sufferings of men, and it no longer told the story of events affecting the lives of men; it became a man-made process, the only all-comprehending process which owed its existence exclusively to the human race. Today this quality which distinguished history from nature is also a thing of the past. We know today that though we cannot "make" nature in the sense of creation, we are quite capable of starting new natural processes, and that in a sense therefore we "make nature," to the extent, that is, that we "make history." . . . We can do in the natural-physical realm what Vico thought we could do only in the realm of history. We have begun to act into nature as we used to act into history . . . technology has emerged as the meeting ground of the natural and historical sciences. ... 1 There are difficulties with Arendt's account of science that need not detain us, except to note that she mistakenly supposes that technological interven tion in nature, of whatever profound sort, somehow entails a breach of "in exorable laws."2 Not only is this a conceptual blunder, it obscures a deeper sense in which we do "make" nature. In fact, Arendt obscures the sense in which we also make history and the world of human culture. For, we make history not because we "act into history," but because history is a human construction. We also make nature?not merely because we literally transform nature by technological intervention but because the only nature we can address intelligibly is a "nature" already conceived, already (somehow) formed (or preformed) in accord with the only ways human understanding functions; and because, by such "constructions" (that, pace Descartes and Kant and Husserl, cannot be meaningfully sorted?as be tween the inflexibilities of the mind and the inflexibilities of the world), we equilibrate the structures of that would-be "world" and the structures of the would-be "laws" of thought. The theme is irrelevantly spoiled by Arendt; although, quite frankly, our own correction is an adjustment meant to go beyond Vico's characteristic insistence on the human production of Copyright ? 1991, THE MONIST, La Salle, IL 61301.</page><page sequence="2">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 269 the cultural life of nation. Its intended benefit, therefore, will have to wait for a while to be made entirely clear. If, thinking along these same lines, we construe history not only as a narrative of some sort but also as the actual temporal process that is human life itself and, by extension, the distinctive career of cultural events and ar tifacts, then it is still true that history is a human construction?which is to say, man makes and remakes himself and his cultural world. If, further more, "nature" is an artifact, in some measure, of that same cultural pro cess, then nature too is "made." Of course, in saying that, one is hardly bound to say that nature, human nature, human culture, history, artifacts of any kind are manufac tured merely, constructed through and through?composed entirely of ideas or fantasies. At every point of human intervention, we acknowledge the resistance of a brute world, including our own existence, whose ar ticulated structure is, once again, specified only artifactually; and if we can not force a principled distinction between the world and what we verbally impute as the world's structure, then the world is a construction?in a sense that permits no disjunction between physical nature and human history. (This much is no more than what remains of the Kantian symbiosis of world and concept, deprived of Kant's optimism regarding the mind's distinct contribution. The theme is certainly also not Vichian.) That we insist nevertheless on the distinction, that we are tempted by "inexorable laws" in science, and deny to nature anthropomorphic traits (human intentionality in particular), testifies to our sense that, though we "make" the world, we cannot make it any way we please. We open our eyes and we see a world we cannot ignore: still, what we see is due to what we are; and what we are we are as a result of our continuous self-formation within a larger history and the larger processes of nature. One is tempted to say that such conjectures cannot but be in coherent?if plumbed sufficiently deeply. But it is not true. One way of securing the point is this: the very laws of nature are artifacts of a histori cized science?both in the sense that their supposedly strict invariance is an idealization that no sustained inquiry can ever discern, and in the sense that the phenomenologically lawlike regularities we do perceive, that "strict" laws idealize, are themselves aptly identified only in the context of the tacit theories by which our own perception is directed. If such a practice holds for physical nature, it cannot fail to be even more compelling when applied to cultural phemonena. Thus, that the apparent significance of finite segments of human history harbor this or that "universal meaning" can hardly be more than a self-congratulatory expression of our own prejudices</page><page sequence="3">270 JOSEPH MARGOLIS regarding the norms and essential needs of the entire race. When, therefore, within the context of a hermeneutic history, Hans-Georg Gadamer declares: The classical is fundamentally something quite different from a descriptive con cept used by an objectivizing historical consciousness. It is a historical reality to which historical consciousness belongs and is subordinate. What we call " classical* ' is something retrieved from the vicissitudes of changing time and its changing taste ... it is a consciousness of something enduring, of significance that cannot be lost and is independent of all the circumstances of time, in which we call something ''clssicaT'?a kind of timeless present that is contem poraneous with every other age. So the first thing about the concept of the classical (and this is wholly true of both the ancient and the modern use of the word) is the normative sense.3 he cannot but be whistling in the wind, he must be betraying his own con ception. In any event, that the invariance of the laws of nature and the universal significance of human history are artifacts of our own careers is easy enough to entertain, without being obliged to suppose they are also merely arbitrary posits. They are posits of some original and sustained sym biosis of cognized world and worlded cognition, in which we cannot deter minately segregate the contributions of mind and world. A great deal hangs on conceding the point. Hannah Arendt is a creature of an earlier time, however, perhaps too much absorbed by the great evil of the political events her remarks on history were meant to il luminate. She fails to grasp the full implications of her own modernity. She admits that history is made; but not having correctly fathomed what that signifies, she fails to grasp as well what history is about, what a "living" history is, what it is the history of, what the sense is in which histories are made, even self-made in the human instance; and so, ultimately, she fails to grasp the radical "nature" of history, that is, that it has no nature and that what is historical "in its nature" also has no nature. There is a predictable bafflement that such remarks set off. At some point it must be met in two quite different ways: in one, to convince us that the idiom is not incoherent or self-contradictory or unusable; in the other, to convince us that it is a distinctly apt idiom, an idiom to be preferred in our own time as a consequence of the changed conceptual options we have come to consider at the close of the century. Arendt says, trying to fix the notion of history, that "the modern concept of process pervading history and nature alike separates the modern age from the past more profoundly than any other single idea."4 But that is a weak claim at best, almost cer tainly false. Arendt's sense of moral unease?her sense of terror?comes from the extreme unpredictability of nature and history now that "we have</page><page sequence="4">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 271 begun to act into nature, [now that] we have manifestly begun to carry our own unpredictability into that realm which we used to think of as ruled by inexorable laws."5 (She has the Nazi example in mind, of course.) This means that she believes that, now, history is not so ruled (or not thought of as being so ruled)?and, as we remarked a moment ago, she believes that nature is similarly in danger of not being bound by the "laws of nature." That argument is preposterous, but not because it is foolish to think that there are no real laws of nature, no inexorable regularities that obtain everywhere without exception (no so-called nomic universals). For, though in the heyday of the unity of science movement it would have been un thinkable to deny the operation of the laws of nature, it is now fashionable (a fortiori, coherent enough) to affirm straight out that nomic universals are fictions or idealizations of some sort, introduced for the sake of and in ac cord with the supposed requirements of explanation in science.6 The unpredictability Arendt has in mind would remain unchanged even in a completely deterministic world: that couldn't possibly be what "separates the modern age from the past more profoundly than any other single idea." No, what separates the "modern age"?the present age?is the dawning notion that what has a history has only a history, no "nature" at all; and that, as a consequence, what we posit as the "nature" of (historied) things is altered and affected (in as intrinsic a sense as can be im agined, once we abandon fixed natures) by the historical process itself, by interpretation and purposive acts reflexively and historically applied to what is historied by "nature." Let us move a little more slowly here. A great deal is at stake. Arendt wishes to resist the idea that history is merely made. She is afraid that that idea is at the heart of totalitarianism: "the conviction that everything is possible."7 Perhaps it is; or perhaps the idea that "history is made" is not the same as that "everything is possible"?in history or in physical nature. In a way, Arendt blames the conceptual slide on Marx. For, she claims, "Marx was only the first?and still the greatest, among historians?to mistake a pattern for a meaning"; "only patterns can be 'made'," she says, "whereas meanings cannot be, but, like truth, will only disclose or reveal themselves [in the larger scheme of things]."8 She means that the meaning of history dawns on us unbidden and compelingly?hence, "unmade" ?as Vico and Hegel thought, arising out of the historical "process as a whole," always beyond "the 'narrow aims' of acting men," con sequently never (as in Marx, on her reading of Marx) explicitly pursued and realized, effectively, pragmatically, deliberately, in a utilitarian man</page><page sequence="5">272 JOSEPH MARGOLIS ner, or in the totalitarian way, in (merely in) the "intended aims of political action."9 Consequently, "acting into history" and "acting into nature" represent, for Arendt (perhaps this is due to her reading of Heidegger's hor ror of technology), the substitution of a history of "patterns" (of manageable projects, of any projects at all) for a history of grander, holistic, "universal" meanings. The meaning of history, she fears, is now pluralized, distributed, rendered particular (within effective reach)?"led to . . . complete mean inglessness" by thinking that historical meaning accrues as the result of achieving any intended objective. The deeds of history, like the events of nature, she holds, are deprived of meaning whenever they are disconnected from the "universal process" (the Hegelian or Viconian process: in effect, paralleling the work of the universal laws of nature) in which they are right ly whatever they are, "they have ceased to make sense [she claims] without a universal process in which they are supposedly embedded."10 But does that mean?could Arendt possibly suppose?that the challenge to nomic universals in recent theories about the direction of ad vanced physics is inherently totalitarian? That cannot be true. But if it is not, then she must also be wrong about universal history. There may be a fascist danger lurking in the use of such theories, but they cannot be in herently totalitarian simply because they eschew "universal" meanings. In any case, the Hegelian and Viconian visions are open to challenge on their own?wherever they are taken to be objectively correct about the telos of universal history. For, even if we spoke in terms of world-historical mean ings, of Geist's telos unfolding beyond the particular projects of particular agents, it would still not be possible to show, for that reason alone, that the counter-charge was false, namely, that history is artifactual, both the pro cess and the narrative. A clever fascist, after all, could use Hegel (and Vico) every bit as easily as he could Marx. In fact, there is no reliable sense in which the unique meaning of the world-historical process is ever simply "disclosed." Hegel's and Vico's sense of history remains attractive never theless. But it must be parasitic on more fundamental models of history; it cannot be more reliable than they; and its objectivity cannot be assured in any case. Give up the invariant laws of nature, concede the historical forma tion of human consciousness: you must abandon as well the universality of human norms of reason, of validity, of truth, of coherence, of meaning, of objectivity, of value. These, as we shall see, are part of the radical possibilities of which nature and culture and cognizing selves and histories and meanings are made. In short, "universal history" does not require gen</page><page sequence="6">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 273 uinely universal historical meanings and is not incompatible with the con structed nature of history, the human world, nature, human persons themselves. This is our theme. II Our claim is that Arendt has missed the mark of what is most radical and most profound in the recent conceptions of history. The essential clue rests with two utterly different notions of history (that implicate a third). On one view, the historical significance of temporal events is entirely due to the interest we take in those events; the events themselves have histories only in the sense that their occurrence extends over a span of physical time; their historical meaning is relationally attributed to them as a result only of our interest in them. On that view, the events and the per sisting particulars they involve have no historical significance intrinsically; to say that they have intrinsic histories is merely a fa?on de parler equivalent to saying that they occur in or persist through a span of real physical time. On that view, there is no reason to deny that mere physical events have histories in precisely the same sense that cultural phenomena do. Nothing depends on the different natures of what may enter into a history. The at tribution of a history is nothing more than a compendious way of collecting the temporal spread of any event, or of any particulars that persist through the interval of physical time that constitutes that event's temporal spread. The time of history and the time of physical nature are one and the same. It is only their (historical) meaning or significance that depends, relationally or extrinsically, on our independent interest in their temporal spread. On the opposed alternative, some events and some particulars, but not all that may be assigned a temporal spread, have histories: to have a history is, in addition to occupying a temporal spread, to have a "nature" apt for possessing historical properties intrinsically; and to possess such properties is to possess, intrinsically, historical meaning or significance, to be open to interpretation, and to "have" (for that very reason) no "nature." In par ticular, cultural phenomena (events and particulars?the writing of a novel and the novel written, the waging of a war and the war waged) have histories because, on the argument, they are suitably complex intrinsically. They have, intrinsically, intentionally complex natures apt for interpreta tion, apt for having histories ascribed to them. On the second view, there is no difference between having a history and possessing historical meaning.</page><page sequence="7">274 JOSEPH MARGOLIS Hence, historical time is fundamentally different from physical time?to which it may conform and which it will most certainly embody because historical time has an inherently intentional structure that physical time lacks. One of the clearest examples of the confusion between the two notions of history occurs in Adolf Gr?nbaum's well-known diatribe against the allegedly hermeneutic nature of psychoanalysis. (The same confusion oc curs in his attack on the views of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur, and J?rgen Habermas.) Gr?nbaum never addresses the conceptual possibility that the time of human history and the time of physical nature are of logically different sorts: he simply takes it for granted that intentionality does not affect in the least the nature of historical time (or of cultural phenomena) in any way that would support a principled difference between the physical and the human sciences. Thus, he affirms the following with characteristic assurance: The physical theory of classical electrodynamics will now enable me to show that Habermas and Gadamer have drawn a psew?focontrast between the nomothetic and human sciences. For that major physical theory features laws that embody a far more fundamental dependence on the history and/or context of the object of knowledge than was ever contemplated in even the most ex haustive of psychoanalytic explanatory narratives or in any recapitulation of human history.11 The question looms, of course, as to whether the first conception of history can accommodate the puzzles that the second conception is intended to ad dress. The odd thing is that Gr?nbaum never feels obliged to examine the matter. Let us call the first view the modernist conception of history. Hannah Arendt means to oppose it (as does Vico, more reliably). The "modernist" camp includes, prominently, such views of history as Gr?nbaum's and C. G. HempePs,12 that embody different forms of the unity of science con ception of physical nature. And let us call the second the post-structuralist conception, though the term, like the first, is certainly tendentious and not entirely accurate?since, thus far at least, it distorts the views of "hermeneutically" oriented theories (like Gadamer's, even Vico's), which, on the whole, are fundamentally opposed to post-structuralism. Vico, for instance, is more nearly a dualist about nature and history (as is Arendt, in her stronger moments) though not a Cartesian dualist; whereas the post structuralists treat physical time and physical nature as no more than conve nient abstractions or fictions or heuristic instruments drawn from within the</page><page sequence="8">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 275 all-inclusive context of historical time. Perhaps Heidegger and Foucault may serve to fix the sense of the latter distinction, which, in a curious way, is the extreme (anti-dualistic) opposite of the reductive intent (Hempel's more than Gr?nbaum's, it should be said) of what we are here calling the "modernist" conception. This helps to define the third view of history hinted at a moment ago?what, unorthodoxly perhaps, we may now call the hermeneutic con ception (shared, however thinly, by Gadamer and Vico)?which emphasizes the disjunction of physical nature and human history and (therefore) the "made," interpretable, or narratizable form of the latter. (Heidegger, we may say, appears more "post-structuralist" than "hermeneutic" in Being and Time, insofar as he prioritizes Temporalit? [the inherent distinction of Dasein], over all particular human categories; but he is also "hermeneutic" insofar as he segregates the "ontic" and the "ontological" and ditinguishes the existential complexities of the human condition from the Zuhandenheit of mere things. These remarks may also serve to indicate the sense in which our categories are merely terms of art; for Heidegger is too early to be a post-structuralist in the French sense, and Vico is too early to be a hermeneut in the German.) The reason for preferring these tendentious labels is simply that the general descriptions so far given (of the two sorts of history) do not quite capture the point of the radical opposition we still mean to identify. It would be entirely reasonable to treat the second conception of history as a hermeneutic conception (a kind of dualism), and go on to define (as post structuralist) a certain extreme theory that erases the dualism of nature and history. That might even help to show the sense in which what is essential to the post-structuralist is directly drawn from the general hermeneutic con ception, even though the two doctrines are known to be unconditionally op posed to one another. Our original purpose, you will remember, was to isolate the radical conception of history that Arendt had missed, which (we shall soon see) the hermeneuts have also missed. Our general argument is intended to show that the modernist conception is simply inadequate for human history, and that the hermeneutic conception fails to concede (quite arbitrarily) the post structuralist option that is continuous with its own. Once this is clear, we can see that the Vichian and Hegelian conceptions of universial history need not be deprived of a modernist and a post-structuralist version?granting, of course, that they already have an assured place in the hermeneutic camp; and granting also, against Arendt's optimism, that their rightful place in</page><page sequence="9">276 JOSEPH MARGOLIS histories of the second sort (opposing physical and historical time) will not fail to be strenuously disputed by conservative hermeneuts and radical post structuralists. The picture is suddenly very complicated. However surpris ing, the conceptual eligibility of universal history has nothing to do, as such, with the different conceptions of history we are gradually defining: it remains intact for each of those options so long as they remain coherent, though it will be infected by their differences. Let us, now, for the sake of a certain tidiness, collect our principal alternatives. The modernist conception, we may say, distinguishes between actual histories and historical meanings, the meaning of prior histories. Anything that persists through physical time ("real time"), or anything that has a "temporal spread" (events as distinct from non-eventual particulars), has a history merely as such; their distinctive natures do not bear at all on their having histories, though those natures will of course affect the par ticular meanings they are assigned. By contrast, the post-structuralist con ception (like the hermeneutic) opposes any disjunction between an event's or a particular's having a history and its having historical meaning. The post-structuralist holds that only certain "kinds" of things (persons, art works, actions, institutions, language, texts, narratives?cultural phenomena in general) are inherently "historied," just those that are intrin sically open to interpretation (because they are intentionally qualified). That is, cultural phenomena "natively" possess historical properties. They are inherently intentional in structure, in virtue of which they possess historical meanings, are inherently interpretable, and may, as a trivial con sequence of their changing history, be ascribed historically changing mean ings {a fortiori, historically changing natures). Both the hermeneutic and post-structuralist conception agree to this much. But the post-structuralists also oppose the dualism of history and nature. They collect the artifactual narratives of science, within which (so they believe) the standard abstrac tions of the "physical sciences" alone obtain. The hermeneuts never go that far. Furthermore, the post-structuralists deny that things, whether of physical nature or of history, have fixed natures at all: in either case, things have no more than conveniently assigned "historied natures." Hermeneuts remain dualists regarding history and nature?not, however, regarding mind and matter; whereas post-structuralists outflank all dualisms by treating conceptual schemes as radically provisional. (That is precisely why we can afford to treat Gadamer and Vico as "hermeneuts.") The her meneuts, therefore, are ultimately inconsistent. What is radical about the post-structuralist conception is that, in addi tion to sharing with late-hermeneutic views (with Gadamer, in particular)</page><page sequence="10">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 277 the thesis that whatever is intrinsically historical (in the sense just given) may have its "nature" directly altered by the historical process itself?say, by interpretation and intentional action), it is also committed to the thesis that what is thus affected has no assignable nature at all, has only a "historied nature," a "nature" that can impose or invoke no invariant or universal constraints of any kind on the historical meanings such things may acquire. The hermeneuts and their allies dispute this (Gadamer and Vico and Hegel and Habermas), and of course the question arises as to whether the post-structuralist conception is coherent. But, at the very least, the modernist and post-structuralist conceptions could not be more op posed: and, frankly, neither could the hermeneutic and post-structuralist. We have already seen that Gadamer arrests the possibilities of historical change and novelty by imposing on all histories (arbitrarily, as it turns out) the normative constraints of the "classical." That means that Gadamer somehow constrains the nature of what has a history, by constraining the historical meanings it can acquire. No hermeneut or Frankfurt Critical theorists has ever satisfactorily explained how, if human existence is essen tially historicized, there can be any invariant human norms recovered from history itself. There is the point of honor between the hermeneut and the post-structuralist. The same may be said of Habermas's and Ricoeur's views, though for entirely different reasons.13 Our distinction is, of course, a distinction of art. There are fairly ex plicit theories of the "modernist" sort of history (not perhaps identified as such), but there are no comparably explicit post-structuralist theories along the lines we have identified. (The post-structuralist is impatient with theories.) Furthermore, it is notorious that hermeneutic theories eschew distinctions of the fine-grained sort we require. (This is less true of Vico than of Gadamer.) Nevertheless, what is most distinctive about our opposed notions is this: the modernist (i) disjoins having histories and having historical meaning, (ii) reduces historical time to physical time, and (iii) treats the conditions for ascribing meanings to histories relationally, only in a way that depends on the extrinsic interest of human historians; by con trast, the post-structuralist (i') opposes the modernist's disjunction, (ii') identifies a range of phenomena (cultural phenomena) that intrinsically possess histories, (iii') distinguishes therefore between physical and historical time (the prinicpal hermeneutic issue), and (iv') acknowledges that whatever possesses a history may change, with respect to its "nature," as a result of its ongoing history (once again, a thesis shared between late hermeneutic and post-structuralist theorists: uneasily, by Gadamer, for in stance, certainly not by Schleiermacher or August Boeckh.)</page><page sequence="11">278 JOSEPH MARGOLIS What distinguishes the two conceptions rests with whether it is coherent (and if so, whether it is also empirically reasonable) to hold to the post-structuralist view without imposing on the "historied nature" of inter pretable things any of the "universal" constraints hermeneutic theories in voke (Gadamer's, regarding the "classical," for instance); and/or whether a strong ontologized distinction between nature and history (as with Vico) can be viably maintained. The hermeneutic alternative either subscribes to (i')-(iii') and opposes (iv'), or accepts (iv') but nevertheless imposes on histories universal constraints somehow drawn from history itself and somehow alleged to be compatible with (iv '). The post-structuralist opposes the dualism of nature and history as well as any fixity of "nature" with respect to which anything, "historied" particulars especially, may be in dividuated. Ill We may collect our alternatives a little more formally. Let us try a quick tally. On the modernist view: (1) the natures of things have no histories, though particulars of this or that nature do; (2) all particulars that persist through time and all events that occupy a temporal spread have histories (in an objective sense) merely as such; (3) historical narratives or historical meanings are ascribed?only and always relationally?to things that have natures and histories, in virtue of a certain extrinsic interest we take in them; (4) historical time is identical with physical time; (5) if real, in tentionally complex, or interpretable, properties enter into the objective histories of things in the same way non-intentional properties do; (6) historical narratives are intentionally ordered representations (or interpreta tions) of actual histories, by which a unified meaning is assigned such histories congruently with their real temporal spread and in accord with the extrinsic interests of a human narrator; (7) the objectivity of historical nar ratives and of assigned historical significance depends on selected criteria of intentionality in accord with which they may be said to correspond to the pertinent intentional features of actual histories (to agents' intentions, for instance). It would be entirely fair to say that the most ramified account of history in accord with this model appears in Arthur Danto's Narration and Knowledge. (With some important qualifications, Habermas seems at tracted to Danto's account.) The model is entirely coherent and spare.14 Its principal strength rests with the fact that a history (a historical narrative) is</page><page sequence="12">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 279 said to be objective if it accurately represents or corresponds to the "history" (the actual persistence) of (and change in) anything at all through physical time, construed (that is, the narrative or interpretation) in accord with a certain perspectival interest a historian takes in it. Hence, anything that persists has a history; historical narratives are selective accounts of the continuum of a thing's peistence through time; and, in every other respect, there is no important logical, conceptual, or cognitive difference between the general concerns of objectivity in science and in history. If the model could be sustained, it would yield an extraordinary economy. Two difficulties arise, however. On one, there is no compelling argu ment to show that the principal referents of history (persons, texts, art works, actions, cultural phenomena in general) have natures in the strong sense in which (1) and (2) of our tally hold; on the contrary, such phenomena are difficult, if not impossible, to construe thus, unless some form of physicalism also holds?which, on independent grounds, is doubtful.15 On the other, the prinicpal referents of history, precisely because they do possess intentionally complex properties, appear to oppose the segregation of (2) and (3); therefore, they violate (7), in that their "natures" change (contra (1)) as a result of intervening action and interpretation. If strong arguments along these lines can be mounted, then the modernist conception fails utterly. So the counterarguments are of two different sorts. On the first, the sanguine view of physical nature (and of the congruity between cultural phenomena and the physical world) can no longer be relied on to ensure the modernist's reductive intent regarding the nature of historical time and objective history. The failure of physicalism, doubts about the realism of invariant laws, the historicizing of science itself threaten to subordinate the physical sciences to the human sciences?hence, to their distinctive methodological complexities. That alone adversely affects the standing of the physical sciences with regard to their providing exemplars of "objective knowledge." On the second, the phenomena of history appear to possess intentional properties that cannot be cognitively managed in ac cord with any of the forms of rigor borrowed from the description and ex planation of mere physical nature. More seems to be needed. By contrast, what we are calling the post-structuralist model entails the rejection of (l)-(7). In particular, on the post-structuralist view: (1 ') the natures of particulars and events that have histories do change through history; alternatively, such particulars have no natures, have only histories or "historied natures," or are themselves only individuated histories; (2') particulars that have histories have histories only in the sense that their iden</page><page sequence="13">280 JOSEPH MARGOLIS tity and persistence through physical time, or their temoral spread, is intrin sically intentionalized or narratized; alternatively, they are culturally emergent entities, constituted and reconstituted, "made," only and always by human action and interpretation; they have no other independent ex istence, they are not constituted merely by the interest we take in indepen dent physical particulars; they lack the objective existence of physical nature, though that is not to say they have no objective existence of their own; (3 ') histories are not relationally ascribed to things in virtue of extrin sic interests; histories and historical properties are non-relationally ("intrin sically") ascribed to persisting things in spite of their lacking natures or possessing only "historied natures"; (4') historical time is fundamentally different from physical time, with which it must accord and which it must embody, since it (but not physical time) has an intentional structure of its own; (5') things that have histories inherently possess intentional proper ties, in virtue of which they are constituted, by human action and inter pretation, as the cultural constructions they are (incorporating particular parts of the physical world); (6') historical narratives are interpretations of things that have "historied natures," by which those natures may be effec tively altered; (7') there is no principled distinction between historical nar ratives or historical interpretations of things that have histories, or historied natures, and those histories and "natures"; these are differentiated only diachronically within particular narratives and interpretations. (The last item signifies what is meant by realism in the world of human culture.) This second model is also self-consistent, though it is hardly spare. It is heterodox and radical, and it requires considerable explanation. There is no tidy specimen theory of this sort. Our own tally is as brief a statement of the model as one can find, but it is more or less in accord with the central themes and more ramified views of such theorists as Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Harold Bloom, without being bound to their own ex travagances. In any case, it is a view that promises to be reconcilable with the dawning perception of just why the unity of science model was bound to fail and what the possibilities of radical history might be?once that failure and the failure of the deeper insistence on the invariant structure of reality proved impossible to discount.16 IV One strategic distinction needs still to be made clear, if we are to secure what we have so far said. It concerns the notion of a thing's "nature" and the possibility that some things have no natures but only histories or</page><page sequence="14">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 281 "historied natures." The idea is a vastly complicated one, but it may be put in a simple way. First of all, all discourse, all discourse concerned with truth or the assignment of truth-like values?all enunciative discourse? must provide linguistic facilities for effective reference and predica tion: we must be able to identify what we are speaking about and what, regarding that, we mean to affirm or deny. There is no plausible rea son to suppose that that is not just as true of history as of physics and morality. Secondly, it has been a staple thesis of the twenty-five hundred years of Western philosophy from, say, Parmenides to W. V. Quine that referents must be fixed, rendered unchanging in some determinate sense, in order that predications may be reliably assigned to this or that particular referent, may be discernibly so assigned, and may be assigned in such a way that an aggregate of communicants may confirmably reidentify the referents of an ongoing discourse and may decide, of what is being predicated of them, what is actually true of them. Thirdly, several theories have been developed during the course of the entire history of Western philosophy intended to account for the discernible fixity of referents ade quate for discursive exchange, but none of them is cognitively adequate: the fixity of reference appears to elude all principled efforts?which is not to say that reference fails, only that it is not theoretically tidy. For example, on the Greek account, Aristotle's in particular, real particulars are said to have invariant natures, in virtue of which they are real. Aristotle believes that the denial of this thesis is incoherent; but, although he attacks Protagoras for having denied it, he nowhere shows that it is necessarily true.17 In any case, the individuation and reidentifiability of particulars (possessing some putatively common nature) obviously cannot be settled merely by attending to the nature they possess (in common); and, of course, Aristotle has no comparable principle to offer for fixing (in a cognitive way) the actual in dividuation of particulars said to share this or that common nature. There is no account of how hyle functions cognitively for the purpose of distributed reference; there is only the claim that individuation depends on the distribu tion of hyle.18 A cognate problem arises from W. V. Quine's would-be Leibnizian solution regarding reference. Quine believes that we may dismiss reference, in principle, since whatever can be referred to can be denoted as instan tiating a unique (general) property (compounded from however many such properties). Quine recommends "reparsing . . . names [and singular terms] as general terms"?for instance, by treating " 'Socrates' as [a] general term [that] would be true of one and only one thing" or by similar means. "Pegasus," in "Pegasus flies" might then be similarly reparsed as a general</page><page sequence="15">282 JOSEPH MARGOLIS term that, if true of anything, would be true of one and only one thing.19 But Leibniz had already seen that no mere human could ever apply the no tion (in effect, Quine's) in a cognitively satisfactory way: reference is therefore ineliminable under real-world circumstances; it cannot but be hostage to history (and, redundantly, to variable context or horizon).20 On ly God could possibly grasp the nature of the universe in which all par ticulars reside and are differentiated; and, even with regard to God, Leibniz will not risk a principled solution in terms of general attributes. Causal (or causal/christening) theories of reference are clearly subject to the same sort of formal laxity that confronts Aristotle's and Quine's op tions; and, in fact, Saul Kripke, one of its principal champions, is entirely explicit about that particular weakness.21 Nor can contextual theories of reference, Wittgensteinian or Austinian in spirit (for instance Gareth Evans's), overcome that sort of limitation (by whatever imagined recovery of the rigor promised by one or another of the options already mentioned); such theories are content to accept the inherent informality of referential practice.22 The reason for mentioning the matter is entirely straightforward: (a) there is no formal procedure for fixing reference uniquely, regardless of one's theory of real particulars, real entities, real referents; (b) reference succeeds in a practical way without requiring any such rigor, (c) there is no antecedent reason why reference should fail, if the failure of individual uniqueness does not entail the failure of reference, if, also, the "natures" of would-be referents are subject to profound change; and (d) all enunciative discourse (all truth-seeking inquiry) depends upon reliable referential prac tices. (a)-(d) form a conceptually stunning challenge to the entire philo sophical tradition running from Aristotle to the present; for it has been standardly maintained (throughout the tradition) that individuation and reference presuppose a certain suitable fixity of nature (essentialized: as by Aristotle; conventionalized: as by Quine) relative to which alone those quasi-logical processes obtain. Denotation and reference, the argument goes, presuppose individuation; individuation presupposes natures; and natures are natures, for the purposes in question, only if, logically (if not also on tologically), they remain fixed and unchanging for all successful episodes of repeated denotation, reference, and identification. That claim now turns out to be either false or indemonstrable?but, in any case, not necessarily true, not demonstrably true (as necessary) de re or de dicto. Furthermore, the very prospect of the viability of radical history depends on the coherence and persuasiveness of (a)-(d).</page><page sequence="16">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 283 In fact, // we agree that history is inherently an interpretive discipline (concerned to assign meaning or significance to things that have histories), then the admission of (a)-(d) has the force of disallowing any logical advan tage favoring (what we have called) "modernist" histories over her meneutic, post-structuralist, or other cognate radical histories; and what, here, holds for history, holds in general for all interpretive practice. There could hardly be a more decisive gain for the revolutionary con ceptual possibilities we have been lightly identifying with the end of our own century and the beginning of the next. We may well be at a turning point in philosophical theorizing that compares in importance with the turn of the Renaissance and the turn ushered in by the French Revolution: the whole prospect hangs on the fate of (a)-(d); and on that hangs as well the local fate of the theory of history and interpretation. They are, in a way, one and the same?species and genus, or else, not even open to hierarchical priority. The radical notion, the master notion at stake, is simply this: all the conceptual puzzles of science, morality, history, art, language, technology, interpretation are now to be recovered under the banner of radical history. And, by radical history, we mean at least: first, that we have no reason to think the real world is invariantly structured, distributively structured in any fixedly essential or necessary way; second, that, if that is so, knowledge and inquiry never discern an invariant order or an order not already depen dent on the contingent symbiosis of knower and known; third, that they themselves are historically preformed in a tacit and blindly pespectived way; fourth, that reference and predication are effective in practice despite our lacking any principled criteria for fixing the unique identity of this and that, or for fixing changeless universals in virtue of which (alone) our particular ascriptions and interpretations are rendered intelligible; fifth, that the referents of our discourse need not possess or have assigned to them fixed natures, but may change with respect to such "natures" or histories or "historied natures" as a result, without disabling reference or reidentifica tion, of reflexive interpretation and deliberate action; and sixth, that, as a consequence, even the physical sciences, even logic and mathematics, are, as far as their lawlike and formal invariances are conceded, heuristic idealiza tions bound by the conditions just mentioned. No discernible or recom mended uniformities need be disturbed by this way of locating invariance, though it is clear enough that certain theories of invariance favored in the canonical literature cannot be reconciled with it.</page><page sequence="17">284 JOSEPH MARGOLIS We may perhaps now risk the conjecture that this Une of thinking is very close to (but also a move beyond) the intent of one of Vico's master themes?the prinicples of " verum = factum"?narrowly applied to human history but now explicitly generalized, beyond the obviously human produc tion of the cultural world, to include the production of knowledge (as earlier remarked) and, therefore, the production (on the symbiotic thesis just formulated) of the knowable world itself: ... the first indubitable principle [says Vico] above posited [?331] is that this world of nations has certainly been made by men, and its guise must therefore be found within the modification of our own human mind. And history cannot be more certain than when he who creates the things also describes them. Thus our Science proceeds exactly as does geometry, which, while it constructs out of its elements or contemplates the world of quantity, itself creates it [as fictions]; but with a reality in proportion to that of the orders having to do with human affairs, in which there are neither points, lines, surfaces, nor figures. And this very fact is an argument, O reader, that theses proofs are of a kind divine, and should give thee a divine pleasure; since in God knowledge and creation are one and the same thing.23 This is certainly the clue to Vico's anti-Cartesian bias. For, as Vico says a bit earlier: ... the world of civil society has certainly been made by men, and it is beyond all question that its principles are themselves to be found within the modifica tions of our own human mind. Whoever reflects on this cannot but marvel that the philosophers should have bent all their energies to the study of the world of nature, which, since God made it, He alone knows; and that they should have neglected the study of the world of nations or civil world, which, since men had made it, men could hope to know.24 Vico's thesis is being deliberately adjusted here to bring it into strong accord with contemporary notions of radical history, which, let it be said, can also reasonably accommodate Vico's correct insistence that the natural world cannot possibly be merely a human construction of any kind. If we allow the point, then, curiously, it becomes a remarkably easy matter to make room for (a tempered version of what Vico calls) the " pro vidential' ' history of the world?which, in the relevant respect, is also very close to what we may hope to save of Hegel's and Marx's historicized teleologies. In fact, by his own example, Vico offers us a formula (the mat ter may be contested) by which to catch up the essential point of Hannah</page><page sequence="18">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 285 Arendt's complaint against Marx and in favor of Hegel. Needless to say, Arendt's ulterior purpose is blunted, even revised, by the reading intended: It is true that men have themselves made this world of nations . . . , but this world without doubt has issued from a mind often diverse, at times quite con trary, and always superior to the particular ends that men had proposed to themselves; which narrow ends, made means to serve wider ends, it has always employed to preserve the human race upon this earth.25 Providence or Reason, or the putative telos of human history, is, now, by way of radical history, simply a conjecture about the narrative direction of man's symbiotized world, viewed on a scale (whether by Arendt or Vico or Hegel or Marx?or St. Augustine or Foucault or Habermas, for that matter) "superior to the particular ends that men had proposed to themselves." The point, quite simply, is this: that "universal history" can be recon ciled with each of the distinctive types of history we have been consider ing?with modernist, hermeneutic, post-structuralist and related radical histories. To account for the merely formal features of universal history is not at all (as Vico and Hegel and Marx usually supposed) to make substan tive claims about truth and knowledge and certainty and necessity. In short, there is no impoverishing of the scope or possible forms of history and in terpretation that results from merely shifting from modernist to increasing ly radical conceptions of history; and questions of coherence, truth, validi ty, confirmation, certainty are entirely open to our best conjec tures?without the least prejudice as to the choice of narrative or inter pretive form or scope. This is not true, of course, of the choice between modernist or post-structuralist histories themselves. But that was a foregone conclusion, since, as we have seen, those alternatives entail par ticular (second-order) convictions about the enabling conditions of knowledge. We have, therefore, used Vico somewhat unceremoniously in order to separate questions regarding the narrative and interpretive forms of history and questions regarding their cognitive prospects. Clearly, Vico was more sanguine about the disjunction between nature and history than we need to be. In any case, we have demonstrated the formal viability of a "post-structuralist" history (and "post-structuralist" mode of interpreta tion). The arguments that favor radical histories over "modernist" and "hermeneutic" histories depend largely on what we perceive to be their dialectical advantage regarding knowledge and reality. We shall not pursue that question here. It has to do primarily with taking account of the</page><page sequence="19">286 JOSEPH MARGOLIS philosophical themes now salient at the end of our century: the cognitive in transparency of the world; the inseparability of science and the history of science; the social construction of culture and nature and human selves; the historically contingent preformation of human consciousness and under standing; the indemonstrability of necessities de re; the horizonal nature of legitimation; the impossibility of totalizing in conceptual and legitimative terms; and the artifactual contingency of all relevantly universalized claims. Given such concessions and the formal coherence of the post-structuralist alternative, there may be no way to resist it convincingly. Nevertheless, the foregoing argument has been a little too glib. For, for one thing, the post-structuralists?Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Deleuze, Irigaray?are all preoccupied with versions of a single privative theme: the suppression or repression of the "other" (l'autre). By this, we mean to say that philosophical post-structuralism is very nearly spent in a kind of cri tique (call it deconstructive or genealogical, possibly even phenomen ological or pragmatist) that is entirely of a negative or disruptive or sub versive sort, never concerned to recover the disciplined rigor of sci ence or history or interpretation or philosophy that could accommodate its own theme: that is, never concerned to recover any of these practices under the condition of radical history. We must supply a sense of how this may be done with respect to history at least, in order to bring our argument to a proper close. The privative theme is simply this: that no ordered scheme of conceptual categories can accommodate every viable set of distinctions that would answer to the executive interests of actual sub-populations (workers or blacks or women, for instance) affected by already socially en trenched such systems, or answer to those that might otherwise evolve if those in place were not in place.26 There is reason to think that post-structuralism pretty nearly exhausts itself in endlessly exposing the evidence of the "terrorism" and "violence" and "hegemony" of supposedly totalized or totalizable such schemes. (These expressions, "terrorism" and the like, are urged by the post structuralists themselves.) There is, therefore, a deep sense in which the post-structuralist conception forces us to concede that there is no principled disjunction ultimately between philosophy and politics, between savoir and pouvoir (in Foucault*s sense). But apart from the ramifications of all cur rent disputes about the nature of knowledge and reality, there still remains one pivotal positive distinction that would enable us to sketch a vision of radical interpretation that could compare with the best claims of what we have called the modernist and hermeneutic options. It has to do with how to</page><page sequence="20">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 287 preserve the discursive facilities of reference and predication under the con dition of radical history. That option seems never to have been explicitly formulated before. The problem, you will remember, is this: that reference to, and the denotation of, reidentifiable particulars for the purpose of predicative discourse and all that that permits (hence, the practice of history and inter pretation) require the individuatability of such particulars; and their in dividuation?so it has been claimed for twenty-five hundred years?entails the fixity of their natures, ontologically (as with Aristotle) or merely logical ly (as with Quine). The notion of radical history, we have been urging, cer tainly in post-structuralist accounts but also (uneasily) in late-hermeneutic accounts, dispenses with the fixities of "natures." We have already seen that reference cannot be shown to entail such fixities with regard to the numerical distinction or uniqueness of each particular; now, assuming the doubtfulness of the ancient canon?that, necessarily, reality is changeless and science is knowledge of what is changeless (in any of its protean forms)27?there is no known way to demonstrate that "natures" must be changeless either essentially or nominally. This is the fatal flaw of the pre judice that opposes radical history. One way of fixing the point is this: we may say that the (referential) unicity of our referents need not entail any fixed (predicative) unity in the nature of those referents.28 But the question still remains: How is the "unicity" of our referents to be sustained under the condition of radical history? The answer is surprisingly straightforward: it is achieved by narrative devices, by socially shared histories of interpretation Imagine that some text?Shakespeare's Hamlet, say29?identified (let it be noted) only inten tionally, not first physically but only by an array of words possessing a historically assignable sense, is interpreted again and again in ways in which its most recent interpretations are thought to be defensible, on the condition that Hamlet's meaning changes and develops in accord with and under the influence of its ongoing (history of) interpretation. We have already argued that just this sort of narratized (or contexted) numerical identity is presup posed in any successful reference to and reidentification of any particulars. Hence, referential success is entirely compatible with our lacking denotatively unique predications (equivalent to fixed natures) and our ig noring the entire issue. We are now saying that if that is possible, then it must also be possible that substantive changes in the assignment of histories and interpreted meanings may be defended by similar narrative devices. On the argument,</page><page sequence="21">288 JOSEPH MARGOLIS we cannot avoid such narrative dependencies in securing referential success; hence, we need not appeal to any more strenuous resources in securing the predicative relevance of historical and interpretive ascriptions?once we ad mit the changing "nature" of the "historied" things we interpret. Bear in mind that the interpretable things of human culture {Hamlet, say, or the French Revolution) have properties that change both with respect to their nature and their haecceity. Our argument may now be put in a single line: only a practice in accord with radical history could make sense of such interpretation; only devices of narratized history, themselves construed in the same radical sense, could sustain the referential requirement. Nothing else will do. The "nature" of interpretable things is altered by their interpretation?divergently, by diverging interpretations; and only the historied memory of the course of such changes could ensure the success of reidentifying the particulars thus interpreted. We have, therefore, pressed beyond post-structuralist histories to a more affirmative form of radical history?in a spirit not altogether dif ferent from that in which post-structuralist histories press beyond the most extreme forms of hermeneutic histories. (Let us now name this positive view, the radical conception of history.) Two essential distinctions (beyond post-structuralism) mark its advantage: one we have just developed; the other remains to be mentioned. The first, ( ')?to catch up our earlier tally?maintains that serial interpretations proceed by the devices of nar rative history in order to secure referential unicity under condition (iv'). The second, (vi'), must then concede that, if ( ') holds, histories and historied particulars may possess infinitely many histories.30 They may all be sorted (as many as we can pursue) by individuating the different historical narratives by which we fix the interpreted "natures" of the perti nent referents whose numerical identity we fix conformably. The point is that this is by no means an idle or exotic recommendation: as it is actually practiced, interpretation is seen to be more and more con gruent with the radical conception of history here advanced. We have been practicing reference in the manner analyzed. We have been abandoning the fixities of modernist and hermeneutic histories. We cannot, therefore, fail to accord more and more with the open possibilities of the radical concep tion of history. For example, a fairminded theorist like Morris Weitz, having scrupulously canvassed the large literature of Hamlet interpretation (partly in accord with his Wittgensteinian bent, partly in the service of his "emotivist" leanings) and without venturing any opinion about its bearing</page><page sequence="22">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 289 on the different theories of history, draws the following conclusion: "A philosophical examination of our survey of Hamlet criticism reveals the undeniable multiple linguistic character of the criticism as well as its per vasive assumption that this linguistic multiplicity is reducible to a logical univocity. This assumption, I believe, is false. Its falsity can already be detected in the ostensible multiple character of the language of Hamlet criticism, which itself reflects the logically multiple character of its discourse."31 What Weitz means is that, taking Hamlet criticism as a "paradigm" of literary criticism, possibly of criticism in all the arts, we cannot deny an in eliminable "multiplicity?of procedure, doctrine, and disagreement" in all such criticism.32 Weitz offers at least twenty-four sets of "main issues," regarding which his own study confirms the fact that "criticism is many things, not just one"?it is never "logically univocal."33 In fact: interpretation is not the autonomous procedure that some critics claim it is but is the same as explanation;... the meaning of a work of art or of what is central in a work of art are not descriptive but explanatory concepts; . . . evaluation is often argument, and . . . good evaluative argument is neither deductive nor in ductive argument but simply the employment of unchallengeable criteria in sup port of praise or condemnation; . . . dramatic (or artistic) greatness is not a property; that praising and condemning are not describing; and, finally, . . . criticism need not state, imply, or presuppose a true poetics of drama or tragedy or an aesthetics of art in order to render intelligible or to justify its utterances about Hamlet.M Instructively, Weitz arrives at his finding by the most minimal of tests, by adhering as conservatively as possible to the constraints of the "mod ernist" orientation. Hence, any radicalization of his finding would en courage a tolerance for radical history and radical interpretation. It is, therefore, but a step to conclude that the potential infinitude of interpreta tions of a text like Hamlet is vastly more assured once we commit ourselves to the assumptions of radical history?( ') and (vi'); and, with those in place, as well as (i')-(iv'), it is easy to see why it is now bound to gain in plausibility. By contrast, Jean Baudrillard, who is already committed to concep tions of reference and interpretation of the post-structuralist bent (doubtless, incoherently, since there are no stabilities of reference and predication in his theory of the simulacrum) claims: It is by putting an arbitrary stop to this revolving [manipulative] causality [as in Watergate] that a principle of political reality can be saved. It is by the simula tion of a conventional, restricted perspective field, where the premises and con sequences of any act or event are calculable, that a political credibility can be</page><page sequence="23">290 JOSEPH MARGOLIS maintained (including, of course, "objective" analysis, struggle, etc.). But if the entire cycle of any act or event is envisaged in a system where linear continui ty and dialectical polarity no longer exist, in a field unhinged by simulation, then all determination evaporates, every act terminates at the end of the cyle having benefited everyone and been scattered in all directions.35 Baudrillard's point, which deliberately oversteps the usual constraints of coherence in order to make itself heard, is that "simulation threatens the difference between 'true' and 'false', between 'real' and 'imaginary'." It marks "the death sentence of every reference." It signifies the "generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal [or simulacrum]." It introduces, arbitrarily, "the fiction of the real."36 Baudrillard brings all this to bear on the play of interpretations (a for tiori, on the play of histories): Is any given bombing in Italy the work of leftist extremists, or of extreme right wing provocation, or staged by centrists to bring every terrorist extreme into disrepute and to shore up its own failing power, or again, is it a police-inspired scenario in order to appeal to public security? All this is equally true, and the search for proof, indeed the objectivity of the fact does not check this vertigo of interpretation. We are in a logic of simulation which has nothing to do with a logic of facts and an order of reasons. Simulation is characterized by a preces sion of the model, of all models around the merest fact?the models come first, and their orbital (like the bomb) circulation constitutes the genuine magnetic field of events. Facts no longer have any trajectory of their own, they arise at the intersection of the models; a single fact may even be engendered by all the models at once.37 Here, Baudrillard nearly throws all conceptual caution to the winds, though not the conditions of coherence and plausibility that make his own text so engaging. So he suggests the possible explosion of radical history and inter pretation by favoring an untenable description of what is genuinely possible?pour ?pater Foucault perhaps. He is the polar opposite of Weitz, therefore, who senses that the same explosion must exceed the conservative resources of the modernist (the Wittgensteinian) idiom of reference and in terpretation he (Weitz) favors. The sound option lies between these two ex tremes. Our concern in all this, of course, has been to demonstrate the coherence of the radical notion as well as the reasons for thinking that its practice cannot continue to be refused. The best explicit examples of it are, in all probability, to be found in the literary exercises of Roland Barthes and Harold Bloom.38 But, in a larger sense, the ongoing work of all interpreta tion and history could be construed in accord with the radical conception. As soon as one sees the force of this, one sees how easy it would be to</page><page sequence="24">PROSPECTS FOR A THEORY 291 generate, in reverse, from the vantage of a captured future, the essential forms of the post-structuralist, the hermeneutic, and the modernist concep tions of history and interpretation. For, each of these imposes an increasing conceptual restriction on the admissibility of items (iv')-(vi') of our more positive tally. There you have an example of what might count as providential history. Joseph Margolis Temple University NOTES 1.
