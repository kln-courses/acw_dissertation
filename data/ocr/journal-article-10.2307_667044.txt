<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Complex of Traits of Probable Transpacific Origin on the Coast of Ecuador1 EMILIO ESTRADA Museo Victor Emilio Estrada BETTY J. MEGGERS Smithsonian Institution INTRODUCTION INTENSIVE archeological survey and excavation has been conducted on the coast of Ecuador during the past seven years, with the result that the local sequences from El Oro province in the south as far northward as the Manabi- Esmeraldas border can now be described (Estrada 1957a, 1957b, 1958, n.d.; Estrada, Meggers and Evans, n.d.). A by-product of this research has been the identification of previously unsuspected close and numerous resemblances between Ecuadorian complexes and certain ceramic complexes in Mesoamer- ica, indicating that close connections existed between these two regions as early as the beginning of the Formative Period (Coe 1960; Estrada 1957b; Evans and Meggers 1957; Evans, Meggers and Estrada 1959). Recent intensive excavations in the vicinity of Bahia de Caraquez have brought to light a new set of traits that can be shown by comparative distribu- tional analysis to have its closest parallels in an even more distant region. The evidence for this contact is comparable to that supporting the argument for Ecuadorian-Mesoamerican connections; the principal difference is that an ocean intervenes between the coast of Ecudaor and the area of postulated origin of the traits. If the method of comparative analysis is a valid technique for establishing cultural affiliations, then we must conclude either that the newly discovered Ecuadorian complex has a transpacific origin or that the traits forming the complex are not sufficiently unique to preclude the possibil- ity of independent invention. The descriptions and illustrations will permit the reader to form his own opinion, but the authors believe that this is a more unusual complex than are many of the clusters of traits used by anthropologists to support hypotheses of cultural connections in other parts of the world. THE ARCHEOLOGICAL CONTEXT Most of the items that concern us have been encountered in stratigraphic excavations in northern coastal Manabf, where they belong to the Bahia culture and early Jama-Coaque, which occupied the area for a period spanning the beginning of the Christian era. Among the most important, in terms of frequency and complexity, of the unique pottery traits that make their ap- pearance are house models, neck rests, a particular type of seated figurine, rectanguloid pottery net weights, "golf-tee" ear plugs, and symmetrically 913</page><page sequence="2">[63, 1961 914 A merican A nthropologist graduated panpipes. By inference, the coolie yoke and raft navigation by means of center boards can be associated with the complex. Some of these traits are relatively simple and would not if found alone be necessarily indica- tive of transpacific contact. Occurring as they do, however, in association with more unusual elements, they lend their weight to the total evidence supporting the case. Since the temporal position of these traits is important in evaluating their origin, the basis for estimating the date of their appearance in Ecuador should be clearly explained. The archeological framework for coastal Ecuador has been worked out from evidence of several kinds. Local sequences are based on stratigraphic excavation and ceramic seriation, the results of which have been checked by investigations at several hundred habitation sites. As these local sequences became well defined, it was possible to make general period align- ments on the basis of pottery characteristics shared between complexes in different areas. A subdivision into three general chronological periods was found to fit the Ecuadorian developmental situation best. The earliest period, generally but not completely equivalent to the Peru- vian Formative, is represented by two principal and successive cultures. The first of these, Valdivia, is restricted to the shore, probably because a large part of the subsistence was derived from the sea. By inference from sites with related styles of pottery on coastal Peru, incipient agriculture was also practiced. Although technologically crude, Valdivia pottery is varied in form and artistically impressive (Evans, Meggers and Estrada 1959: figs. 32-79). Radiocarbon dates from shell samples at the Valdivia site, as well as dates from related sites in Panama and Peru, place this culture between approximately 2500 and 1800 B.C. (Evans, Meggers and Estrada 1959: 87-92). It was followed by the Chorrera culture, sites of which are found not only on the coast but inland along the major rivers (Evans and Meggers 1957: fig. 1; Estrada 1958: 69-78, mapa 2). Expansion toward the interior, as well as the disappearance of shellfish as a major component of the village refuse, implies that agriculture had become the principal means of subsistence. Close pottery resemblances with wares of the Chavin culture of Peru and the Ocos culture of coastal Guatemala and adjacent Mexico permit a dating of about 1800 to 500 B.C. for the Chorrera culture, a range that is corroborated by dates derived from obsidian samples from a number of Ecuadorian Chorrera period sites (Evans and Meggers 1960: fig. 19). Following this long Formative is a period that has been labeled "Regional Developmental" because it is characterized by a number of distinctive, geographically restricted complexes that appear to have developed out of the Chorrera culture with the differential introduction of a variety of new elements (Estrada 1958: 15-16, mapa 3). Some of these latter belong to previously identified Peruvian horizon styles, such as negative (resist) and white-on-red painting. Others are less complex, and many are probably localized develop- ments. The contemporaneity of these regional complexes has been established by the horizon styles that they share, and by occasional fragments of trade</page><page sequence="3">ESTRADA AND MEGGERS] Transpacific Origin of Traits in Ecuador 915 pottery or borrowing of pottery elements. Obsidian dates have confirmed this chronological alignment and have fixed the duration of the regional develop- mental period at from about 500 B.C. to about A.D. 500 (Evans and Meggers 1960: fig. 19). The third and final chronological period is characterized by domination of the Ecuadorian coast by two groups, the Manteno along the shore and the Milagro along the foothills. Their material remains, in the form of sites, ceramics, and other kinds of artifacts, are dissimilar, but large population concentrations and an advanced form of socio-political integration are charac- teristic of both (Estrada 1957a, 1957b). Adapted to different ecological zones, they apparently expanded at the expense of earlier localized groups, and at the time of the Spanish conquest each dominated its respective portion of the coastal area. Obsidian dates from Milagro sites range from about A.D. 500- 1500 (Evans and Meggers, 1960: fig. 19), and the indications are that the Manteno culture is of contemporary duration. The Bahia culture, which is of particular concern in this paper, is one of the localized complexes characterizing the regional developmental period. Its identification with this portion of the sequence is based on stratigraphic evi- dence, which shows it developing out of a Chorrera-like ancestor, and by its possession of the diagnostic horizon markers, negative and white-on-red painting. Two radiocarbon dates for Bahia I levels of 2200_+ 240 (USGS sample W-834), and 2150+240 (USGS sample W-833) years confirm this chronolog- ical placement, as do several obsidian dates (Rubin and Alexander 1960:180- 81). The presence of numerous Manteno sites in the vicinity of the Bahia sites places an upper limit to the duration of the Bahia culture at around A.D. 500-700. The traits with Asiatic prototypes are found in levels of the earlier part of the Bahia sequence, designated as Bahia I, and are consequently estimated to have made their appearance during the first two centuries preced- ing the beginning of the Christian era. Geographically, they extend from the focus of the Bahia culture in northern Manabf northward into the province of Esmeraldas. In presenting evidence for a transpacific origin for these archeological traits, we take our orientation from the New World context in which they occur. Our present relatively detailed knowledge of coastal Ecuadorian pre- history shows the traits in question to be without identifiable local antecedents and, with few exceptions, not to have spread to other contemporary groups or to have survived to a later time. Most of them are unknown elsewhere in the New World. By contrast, all are found in Asia, the majority are widespread there, and all have a minimum antiquity equal to that of the early Bahia culture. This chronological and geographical context in both the New World and Asia, plus the fact that we are dealing with a complex rather than a series of isolated traits, is as significant as the detailed similarities between the traits themselves. Since words do not convey as good an impression as illustrations, descrip- tions have been restricted to pointing out what seem to be significant details.</page><page sequence="4">916 American Anthropologist [63, 1961 Documentation does not attempt to be exhaustive, but only to show the antiquity and something of the distribution of the traits in the Old World. Two considerations should not be overlooked when the illustrations are compared. First, although the greater antiquity of each trait in Asia can be documented, it was not always possible to find pictures of the early examples. Consequently, some of the pictures show modern forms in the Old World. Second, a difference in medium or the influence of indigenous art styles may be responsible for some of the divergences between the Ecuadorian and Asian examples. In the case of the seated figures, the small pottery ones from Ecuador are equated with large stone sculptures from southeast Asia, and the comparatively greater crudity of the pottery figurines should not be allowed to obscure similarities in posture and other details to Asiatic forms. DESCRIPTION OF TRAITS Pottery house models. Models of houses with distinctive architectural features have been recovered from a number of sites in Esmeraldas and northern Manabi. The majority were not scientifically excavated, so that their chronological identification rests on comparative evidence. Several are reported to have come from La Tolita, but the fame of this site is such that practically all archeological specimens offered for sale in Esmeraldas are purported to originate there. Two are definitely from northern Manabi, one reported by Saville (1910: pl. C, 1 and 2) from the Bahia de Caraquez area, and another recovered from stratigraphic excavations in the Jama area (Estrada n.d.). Chronologically significant features are the style of the figurines seated in the doorway of two examples, and the painted decoration in the negative or resist technique clearly shown on two of them: one from Jama (fig. la) and one from La Tolita (fig. 4b). One of the models shows both three-color negative decora- tion and a figurine of the Cojimies type (fig. la), both traits attested by frag- ments from stratigraphic excavations to belong to the Bahia I period and culture (Estrada n.d.). Of the 11 house models, one forms the upper portion of a jar (fig. 4b), and three others served as containers, having a spout or spouts projecting from the roof and connecting with a cavity in the interior ( fig. la, 3a, 4c). The remain- ing seven are models rather than vessels. They are rectangular in floor plan, with entrances at the ends. Height is typically least at the center of the ridge, increasing toward the gabled ends, creating a concave or saddle ridge. In their architectural features, these models depart from typical New World house types. The ridge is slightly to markedly curved, rising at front and back to a high peak, which is often accentuated further by decoration (figs. 4b-d). In addition to their upward projection, the gables often project outward also (fig. 3a). On two of the models (fig. la), the gable beams rest on a well-defined small support. Additions to the roof are common. In some cases these appear to be principally or exclusively ornamental (fig. 2b). Other features, such as a series of strips laid across the ridge, are probably functional, perhaps depicting logs for weighting down the thatch (fig. 3a). Two of the</page><page sequence="5">ESTRADA AND MEGGERS] Transpacific Origin of Traits in Ecuador 917 models (figs. 2a, 3a), have a double roof leaving a hollow space or attic. Al- though most have vertical, solid side walls and a wide doorway at the end, one has the roof supported on a series of circular columns (fig. 3a) and two (Larrea Collection; Estrada Collection) have a column at each end supporting the gable. The house rests on a flat slab or slightly raised platform, with access at the front provided in one case by a stairway (fig. 2a). Several of the models show a textile imprint on the bottom, left by the material on which they rested during manufacture. While house models are known from several archeological complexes in Peru and Mesoamerica, particularly in later horizons, none of these show the com- bination of architectural features characteristic of the Ecuadorian examples. They have horizontal rather than saddle ridges and depict simple huts and lean-tos, or typical New World types of construction. It is only in Asia and Oceania that the Ecuadorian houses find close structural parallels. In Asia, also, house models of pottery were made and used for funerary purposes, whereas outside of this small part of Ecuador, New World examples are principally ornamented containers (except in parts of Mexico, where houses were modeled as part of a well-developed depiction of daily activity in pot- tery). A ceremonial or funerary function for the Ecuadorian house models has not been established conclusively, but their nonutilitarian form makes this use seem probable. Houses with a saddle roof, low at the center and rising to high eaves at the ends, are distributed widely in southeast Asia and Indonesia. In recent times, they have been reported from Sumatra (fig. 4a; Loeb 1935: 21 and 99; Cole 1945: opp. 245; Vroklage 1936: fig. I-III and IV, fig. 5-XII), from New Guinea (Vroklage 1936: fig. 1-VI), from the western Caroline Islands and from Kusaie in the eastern Carolines (Vroklage 1936: fig. 5-XV; Tischner 1934, distribution map 5), from West Java (Tischner 1934: fig. 14), and from Thai- land (Huirlimann 1930: 170). While its antiquity cannot always be conclusively established, there are indications that this roof form was in existence rather early. Heine-Geldern (1935: 319) mentions a house with a saddle roof depicted on bronze drums from Tonking dated around the beginning of the Christian era. Vroklage (1936) believes it to have been diffused into Indonesia at this time. Outwardly projecting eaves are shown on Japanese haniwa (fig. 5b) of the protohistoric period (Kidder 1959: fig. 33). A double roof construction similar to that on two of the Ecuadorian models (fig. 2a, 3a) was employed in Japan to provide storage space. Other features represented in Japanese archi- tecture are logs placed crosswise along the ridge pole and the use of an exterior supporting post for ends of the ridge pole. The former is shown on some of the Japanese haniwa (Kidder 1959: fig. 33 g, i, j) and on the Ise shrine of Uji- Yamada (fig. 3b) and is believed to be an early structural detail (Kidder 1959: 143). It occurs on pottery models of the Han period in Indo-China (fig. 5a; Janse 1947: 42) and China (Cheng 1957: pl. 46-1 and 2). At the present time, bundles of thatch laid along the ridge in the same fashion are found on Formo- san house roofs (Kano and Segawa 1956: 36-7, 40-1). A freestanding post</page><page sequence="6">American Anthropologist [63, 1961 918 supporting each end of the ridge pole was a typical feature of houses of the Yayoi period in Japan, beginning around the 3rd century B.C. (Kidder 1959: 91, 97). Ornamental treatment of gable fronts is typical of southeast Asia, extending out into Indonesia, and examples can be found with either carved or painted decoration (e.g., fig. lb). Even the extremely prolonged gable on one Ecuadorian example (fig. 4d) is paralleled in roof treatments from Sumatra (fig. 4a). Models of houses similar in size and construction to those from Ecuador form part of the mortuary pottery of the Han dynasty, between the 2nd century B.C. and the 1st century A.D. (Laufer 1909: 8-9 and pl. VI). They are also a common kind of haniwa represented in Japanese tombs of the proto- historic period (Kidder 1959: 137-39). Neck rests The identification of these objects is based on their resemblance to head or neck rests from other parts of the world. Ecuadorian neck rests are generally rectanguloid, and consist of a flat base and a concave platform, the two connected by one, two, or three cylindrical post-like supports (fig. 6c). A few have a hollow cylindrical or annular base (fig. 8a). Some have incised decora- tion on the concave upper surface (fig. 6c) or on the sides (fig. 8b), while others have modeling on the base (fig. 6a-b). On some the base or the supports assume an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic form (fig. 6a). Most examples are about 15 cm. long and 8-10 cm. high at the center, but larger ones have been found. Stratigraphic excavations at Bahia de Caraquez establish their presence in the Bahia I period. Neck rests of wood, stone, pottery, or other materials occur widely in the Old World. In Egypt, they are found in all periods beginning prior to the 25th century B.C. with a single column type popular throughout most of the dynastic history (Erman 1894: 185; Hayes 1959: 27; Paine 1955: iii and pl. 37a). A pottery neck rest from Mysore, India (fig. 9a), dates from the early Iron Age or the first millennium B.C. (Foote 1916: 62, 69). The earliest pottery examples come from the Jhukar culture in India, dated at about 1700 B.C. (Mackay 1943: 220, P1. LXXXIX-3, P1. XCII-38). In China, headrests were made over the centuries from a great variety of materials, ranging from cloth to porcelain (Kates 1948: 47; Paine 1955). The earliest pottery examples are from the T'ang dynasty (8th-9th cent. A.D.), although references appear in Chinese texts of the 3rd century A.D. (Paine 1955: 1, 7). Wooden neck rests are reported still in use in New Guinea (fig. 7a; Leenhardt 1950: pl. 14; Linton and Wingert 1946: 131, 142), Sumatra (Loeb 1935: 131), Borneo (fig. 9b), and Samoa (Linton and Wingert 1946: 30) and other parts of Oceania. They are also used in many parts of Africa (fig. 7b). Figurines Figurines are abundant in the Manabi-Esmeraldas area from Bahia I to the time of European contact, and several general varieties have been distinguished (Estrada 1957b). Among them is a type called "La Plata Seated" that exhibits several distinctive features.</page><page sequence="7">ESTRADA AND MEGGERS] Transpacific Origin of Traits in Ecuador 919 All La Plata Seated figurines have the legs laid one above the other, so that the right foot rests upon the left knee or vice versa (fig. 10c-d). This leg posture is so standarized that it is even shown on a reclining figure (fig. 6b). The arms extend forward with the hands resting on the upper leg. All the figures wear rounded or dougnhut-shaped earplugs and a cone-shaped pendant. The major- ity have a wide, thick bracelet at each wrist, in one case ornamented with a row of circular depressions and in another with a medial line. The headdress is variable, but on several resembles a helmet, with flaps over the ears and with a peaked top (fig. 10d). Two have a wide brim. Although beards are practically nonexistent in other Ecuadorian figurine types, a small double beard on the chin is typical of La Plata Seated examples (fig. 10c-d; Estrada 1957b: fig. 90). Other characteristics of this figurine style are the relative simplicity of dress and ornament and the realistic modeling of the faces. Several aspects of these figurines suggest Asiatic prototypes. The most striking is the manner in which the legs are laid one upon the other rather than crossed. Known in India as vajrapariyanka or adamantine position (Sestieri 1959: fig. 8), this leg arrangement is found on many religious images from India, southeast Asia, and Indonesia (fig. 10a-b; Huirlimann 1930:33, 38, 145, 155). One from Annam, dated from the 10th century A.D., is very similar to the Ecuadorian figures in posture and naturalistic expression (fig. 10b; Zimmer 1955: pl. 510). While the antiquity of this posture is not easily estab- lished, it is said to be exhibited by some Harappa figurines (Willetts 1958, 1:295). Among the ornaments, the cone-shaped pendant can be compared to the magatama, a characteristic ornament in Japan and Korea from the late neolithic period onward (Kidder 1959: 69, fig. 56). Circular ear plugs are associated with magatama in Japan (Kidder 1959: 68-69, fig. 11). The hat shown on figure 10d is paralleled in head coverings worn today in Burma (Ferrars 1900: fig. 335) and Indochina (Robequain 1931:233). Symmetrically graduated panpipes A number of figurines of the Tolita, Bahia, and Cojimies types are shown playing panpipes that are graduated from both sides toward the center, the longest tubes being at the sides (fig. lla-c). The number of tubes or pipes is usually six, perhaps because the small size of the figurines made representation of a larger number difficult. However, a panpipe with five tubes graduated toward the center is used by the modern Motilones of the Sierra de Perija, Colombia (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1945: P1. VI-4). In one case, the instrument is bifurcated and the pipes in each side are of equal length rather than graduated (Estrada 1957b: fig. 129). A variant, in which the two wings are connected by a cord rather than bound into a single unit, survives in the highlands of Bolivia (Mead 1924:326) and among the Cuna of Panama (Nordenskiold 1938:75-76, fig. 11). In southeast Asia, similar two-part panpipes are still used by the Karen-ni of the Burmese hinterland (Sachs 1917:31, P1. 15, figs. 46-47). The panpipes used by the Padaun, also in Burma, have four long tubes added to the short side, approaching the appearance of some Ecuadorian examples (fig. lld; Sachs</page><page sequence="8">920 American Anthropologist [63, 1961] 1917:31, P1. 15, figs. 50-51). The antiquity of this instrument as a musical standard appears to be considerable in China, a possible literary reference dating from about 1100 B.C. (Sachs 1940:176). Twelve tubes was the usual number, and they were frequently enclosed in a decorated case (fig. lie). In modern times they are arranged either with the longest at the center or the longest at the sides (Sachs 1940:178). A group of musicians depicted at Sanchi in India, and dated from the 1st century A.D., includes one playing a bifurcated instrument somewhat resembling the Ecuadorian one (Marcel- Dubois 1937:38, PI. XIV-4). According to Sachs (1940:197-98), this two-part or bifurcated form of panpipe reflects a separation of the tones into two sets of alternating notes. In both East Asia and among the Cuna Indians of Panama, one set is considered male and the other female. He concludes that "a scale, alternately distributed between two pan-pipes which are connected by a loose cord or joined together can hardly be supposed to have originated spon- taneously in several parts of the world" (1940:198). Pottery net weights Net weights of pottery, oblong with rounded edges and with holes in four places, two near each end, are found on coastal Ecuador in several complexes of the regional developmental period, including Bahia. The largest is 5 by 7 centimeters (fig. 12a). Although this is a relatively simple artifact, the striking resemblance to net weights from the Han period in Indo China (fig. 12b; Janse 1947:pl. 144-42) may not be fortuitous in view of the other correspondences that can be shown to exist between the two parts of the world. "Golf-tee" ear plugs A peculiar form of pottery earplug, similar in general shape to a golf tee, appears in the levels of the Bahia culture (fig. 14b-c). Earplugs of the same type occur in Japan, beginning with the Jomon period (fig. 14a; Kidder 1959: fig. llj, dated earlier than the second millenium B.C. TRAITS PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPLEX Coolie yoke The coolie yoke is a typical Asiatic method of carrying burdens, in contrast to the tump line used in the New World. An incised spindle whorl from Manabi, unplaced stratigraphically but stylistically equated with the Regional Developmental Period, shows both carrying devices (fig. 13). This is the only evidence of the coolie yoke so far discovered in Ecuador, but the fact that it is constructed of perishable materials would rule out any preservation other than an accidental depiction of the kind shown on the spindle whorl, affording greater potential significance to this isolated example than would otherwise be the case. Like the symmetrically graduated panpipe, this trait appears to have survived in Panama until the time of the Spanish conquest (Nordenskiold 1930:56-61).</page><page sequence="9">a b FIG. 1.

Their vehicles were large sailing rafts of balsa logs, equipped with a sail and movable center- boards or guaras, whose navigability and seaworthiness have been amply attested by observation and experiment (fig. 15; Estrada 1955; Heyerdahl 1955). Elsewhere in the New World, centerboard navigation is found only on the coast of Brazil (Hornell 1946:82). On the opposite side of the Pacific, it occurs in Formosa and Vietnam (Ling 1956:36). Although the transpacific distribution of seagoing rafts using center boards has been noted by several authors (e.g., Hornell 1931:355, 1946:89-90), the most exhaustive treatment is by Ling (1956: 26-35) who describes the modern Formosan rafts in great detail, both construction and methods of navigation (fig. 16). Formosan sea-going rafts are generally composed of 9 or 11 bamboo poles. Ordinarily there are six center board positions, two at the front, two at the center, and two at the rear. The center boards are of camphor wood and are 70-90 cm. long by 50-80 cm. wide. They are inserted either between two of the poles forming the raft or into a slot in a section of bamboo laid over the junction of two poles. The general form of the Vietnamese raft is the same as the Formosan ones. However, there are usually three center boards, and the raft typically carries two sails (Ling 1956: 36). An investigation of historical sources leads Ling to the conclusion that the navigation of seagoing rafts, which necessarily implies the use of centerboards, can be reliably dated along the Chinese coast as far back as the 5th century B.C., and perhaps to the 33rd century B.C. (1956:45-49, 51). While the balsa cannot be proved to have an antiquity in Ecuador comparable to the other traits discussed in this paper, its distribution and antiquity in southeast Asia permits this inference to be made. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE Although a conclusion about the existence of connections between two parts of the world should be based on evidence in the form of complexity of the traits and their temporal and spatial distributions, inferences about prehistoric transpacific contacts always bring up the question of how such distances could have been traversed by primitive navigators. No attempt will be made to review possible routes, but it can be mentioned that the counter equatorial current, running eastward just north of the equator, leads directly toward the northern coast of Ecuador (U. S. Hydrographic Chart No. 1401, November, 1960). Farther to the north, the Japanese current flows eastward to join the Mexican current moving down along the Pacific coast to Ecuador. Arguments that a small group of people appearing on the shore would be liquidated or absorbed by the local inhabitants can be countered by a case from the history of the region involved. A few years after European discovery, in the early 16th century, 17 Negroes survived a shipwreck off the coast of Esmer-</page><page sequence="24">936 American Anthropologist [63, 1961 aldas. Intermarrying with Indian women, they were able to gain political control of the whole province in a short time. Their domination continued for several decades, during which time the Spaniards were unable to conquer the area (Cabello de Balboa 1945:133). It seems reasonable to infer that the Asiatic traits that appear on the same portion of the Ecuadorian coast some 1,500 years earlier could be the reflection of a similar stray landing party, whose journey had not taken them much farther from home. It is pertinent to point out also that in terms of the receptivity of the indigenous cultures to outside influence, the period just preceding the begin- ning of the Christian era was probably the most ideal. The Formative stage, during which the slow adjustment to an agricultural subsistence took place, had ended. The potential for elaboration of all aspects of the culture was available. If there is any point at which it can be said that the stage is set for the introduction of new ideas, this was surely true of coastal Ecuador around 200 B.C. On the Asiatic side of the water, the time at which this contact is deduced to have taken place was one of tremendous expansion. The middle Yayoi period in Japan, extending from about the 1st century B.C. to the 1st century A.D., reflects extensive influences from the Asiatic continent, represented not only in trade objects but in a general transformation of the social order (Kidder 1959:91-92). In southeast Asia, by the 3rd century A.D., long voyages were being made by ocean-going vessels capable of carying 600 men and 1000 metric tons of cargo (Biggs 1951:22). Chinese expansion beginning in the Tsin Dynasty had incorporated northern Annam by 214 B.C. and southern Annam a century later (Majumdar 1927:14). Indian colonies and Hindu influence were well entrenched in Indochina by the 2nd century A.D., implying several centuries of relatively intensive preliminary contact (Majumdar 1927: xxii). In view of the sea travel involved in this political and commercial activity, it does not seem unlikely that vessels were sent off course by storms. Heavily pro- visioned as they were, they could easily have sustained at least part of the passengers as far as the New World (Lou 1957:95-96). In the last century there is a record that nine occupants of a Japanese junk survived an accidental drift of 11 months (Sittig 1896:530). It can no longer be realistically argued that either the means or the oppor- tunity to make a transpacific journey from Asia to America was lacking; indeed, all things considered, it is surprising that so little serious attention has been paid by scholars in either hemisphere to this problem. It is our hope that the evidence presented here will stimulate New World archeologists to watch for similar complexes in other areas and will lead archeologists in Asia to follow out the clues and to pin down the region from which the people came.
