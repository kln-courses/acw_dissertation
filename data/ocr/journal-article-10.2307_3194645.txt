<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bend Sinister: Joyce, Shakespeare, Nabokov Michael H. Begnal By a strange coincidence there are two works of modern literature which feature rich and strange discussions of Shakespeare's Hamlet: one is James Joyce's Ulysses and the other is Vladimir Nabokov's Bend Sinister. Joyce's novel illuminates the purposes of Nabokov's, and it is the intent of this essay to show how Joyce, Ulysses, and even Finnegans Wake lie behind the structure of Nabokov's first English novel. The introduction to Bend Sinister tips us off to the fact that the reference to: "the 'other rivermaid's father' (Chapter Seven) is James Joyce who wrote Winnipeg Lake (ibid.)."' I would go so far as to say that Joyce is also something of a character in the novel, much as he appears as a failed writer and failed priest in Flann O'Brien's The Dalkey Archive. In the midst of his own struggle with the totalitarian regime of his old schoolfellow Paduk, the embattled Adam Krug comforts his friend Ember, Literary Adviser to the State Theatre, who has been forced to supervise a bastardized, propaganda version of Hamlet. To cheer Ember up, Krug tells him the story of: "a curious character with whom he once travelled in the States, a man who was fanatically eager to make a film out of Hamlet" (BS, 111), who outlined the project to Krug in the lounge of a men's room on a train. Whenever Nabokov introduces a mysterious face, the reader has to be wary. This seedy character: "was a hawkfaced shabby man whose academic career had been suddenly brought to a close by an awkwardly timed love affair" (BS, 112), and again, on the following page, he is described as: "The hawk-man in the toilet lounge." We might remember that in A Portrait Stephen Dedalus identified himself with Dedalus: "the hawklike man whose name he bore,"2 and, even closer to the mark, in the Shakespeare chapter of Ulysses Stephen again thinks of himself as: "Fabulous artificer, the hawklike man."3 The badly timed affair might possibly refer to Joyce's flight from Dublin with Nora Barna- cle in 1904 which brought him from academics to artistry, and the film- maker in the bathroom is probably Nabokov's reincarnation of Joyce. An examination of the abovementioned Scylla and Charybdis chapter brings up some even more interesting parallels or clues. The bland librarian Lyster calls Hamlet: "The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels that Goethe's judge- ments are so true" (U, 184). Ember repudiates this banality along with that of his ingenue Gloria Bellhouse: "She and the producer, like Goethe, imagine Ophelia in the guise of a canned peach" (BS, 116). Certainly Nabokov would repudiate Stephen's reliance in his theory on the Vien- nese quack whose picture shows up later on the wrapper of a razorblade in another toilet, but Krug does suggest jokingly that: "Hamlet in reverse gear becomes the son of Ulysses slaying his mother's lovers" (BS, 115). In this Homeric context an even closer echo can be heard. Stephen asserts 22</page><page sequence="2">that Shakespeare had many affairs with women at all levels of rank, and he wonders: "But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?" (U, 202). Ember envisions the same problem between Hamlet and Ophelia: "While he was busy with German servant maids, she at home, in an embayed window, with the icy spring wind rattling the pane, innocently flirted with Osric" (BS, 114). If the man in the men's room is not Joyce or Stephen Dedalus, then he certainly owes them a debt. Nabokov, again in his Introduction, cites Mallarme as a voice in this novel, though he associates Krug with "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune," one of: "three or four immortal bagatelles" (BS, xi). The librarian Best also refers to Mallarme's essay "Hamlet," where Hamlet walks: "don't you know, reading the book of himself" (U, 187), a description which might also be applied to Adam Krug. The hawk-man has suggested that the film would start like this: "We'd begin, he had said, with / Ghostly apes swathed in sheets / haunting the shuddering Roman streets" (BS, 111), which seems to be the phantasmagoric opening of Joyce's Circe chapter coupled with Shakespeare's lines: "A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, / The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead / Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets (Hamlet, I, i, 11. 114-116). Joyce supplies the apes. The following metamorphic stage direction might be lifted right out of Circe as well: "By dream law and screen law the cannon is gently trans- formed into the obliquity of a rotten tree trunk in the garden. The trunk points cannonwise at the sky where for one instant the deliberate loops of canescent smoke form the floating word 'self-slaughter"' (BS, 112). (The hawklike man is an innovator, but he is also misreading Hamlet's: "Or that the Everlasting had not fixed/His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!" [Hamlet, I, ii, 11. 131-132]. Or perhaps he is a victim of Nabokov's paronomasia.) Though Nabokov always denied the influence of other writers on his work,4 much of this chapter in Bend Sinister is a web of allusions. In terms of theme, Stephen questions the idea of fatherhood: "Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son? ... What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut" (U, 207-208). Krug counters with the idea that a child is: "formed by a fusion which is, at the same time, a matter of choice and a matter of pure enchantment; thus formed and then permitted to accumulate trillions of its own mysteries" (BS, 188). The dream of love is strongly on Krug's mind. In Nabokov's own discussion of Joyce's Shakespeare chapter he concentrates on the similarities of Bloom's and Stephen's dreams, which will be discussed later, but Nabokov also says: "The discussion in this chapter is one of those things that is more amusing for a writer to write than for a reader to read."5 His point is certainly debatable. The allusions to Finnegans Wake in these pages are almost as numerous. Giordano Bruno and Giambattista Vico are well known influ- ences on the Wake, and both are mentioned. The first shows up as: "Hamlet at Wittenberg, always late, missing G. Bruno's lectures" (BS, 112), and the second appears as: "suited his liquidity to a tee: cp. Winnipeg Lake, ripple 585, Vico Press edition" (BS, 114). The "p" in "cp," instead of "cf," might be explained by the facts that the river god Alpheus mentioned 23</page><page sequence="3">in the text just before contains the initials of ALP and is also the name of the river Heracles used to cleanse the Augean Stables. Joyce had a fond- ness for describing excretion, and "Winnipeg" in the Algonquian Indian dialect means "filthy stream." Make of it what you will. "Lithe, lithping, thin-lipped Ophelia, Amleth's wet dream, a mermaid of Lethe" (BS, 114) bears strong resemblances to Joyce's river speech, along with echoes of the Liffey River and Anna Livia. Remembering that all American editions of the Wake have the same pagination, we could turn to page 585, and there find HCE and ALP's botched lovemaking: "repeals an act of union to unite in bonds of schismacy. O yes! O yes! Withdraw your member! ... Humbo, lock your kekkle up! Anny, blow your wickle out! Tuck away the tablesheet! You never wet the tea!"6 Perhaps this might explain "to a tee" and "Amleth's wet dream." "Rosenstern and Guildenkranz, those gentle interchangeable twins 'who came to heal and went away to die,' are snoring in their common bunk" (BS, 112), and they sound remarkably similar to the Earwicker twins Shem and Shaun. Nabokov's description of Ophelia: "She was one of those thin-blooded pale-eyed lovely slim slimy ophidian maidens" (BS, 114) sounds very much like Joyce's of Anna Livia as a girl: "She was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then" (FW, 202.26). There are several other points of similarity which will not be gone into here, but the case does seem to be made. The final question to be answered is why does Nabokov make such heavy use of Joyce in Bend Sinister, and the answer is to be found in the novel's narrative structure. One of its most confusing aspects is the con- stant and initially inconsistent shift in pronouns which in many places makes it very difficult to figure out who is telling the story. The first chapter is narrated by an "I," apparently Krug just learning that his wife Olga will die, but the second chapter looks at Krug from another appar- ently different "I" point of view, while at the same time allowing him to enunciate his own thoughts occasionally as "I." As well, Krug is able to step back and look at himself objectively, leading to his observation that: "The square root of I is I" (BS, 7). Stanley Edgar Hyman comments that Nabokov: "is a godlike chessplayer who controls all the pieces on both sides,"7 and Julia Bader sees it as: "the dual process of Krug creating his world, encircled by the author creating Krug and his world." But things are even more complicated than this. The shifts in point of view become more and more complex. Third person becomes first: "he looked around, met Krug's eyes, showed no sign of recognition and uncertainly went down the few steps that remained. His face became larger, dimmer, and vanished as it met mine" (BS, 223). In another place, the narrator stops the action to give himself directions, but the narrative continues before he can implement them: "Krug, semi-intentionally, keeps out of reach. He is a difficult person. Describe the bedroom. Allude to Ember's bright brown eyes" (BS, 106). "Last chance of describing the bedroom. Too late" (BS, 107). When Krug is presented accidentally surprising the naked Mariette in the tub, his consciousness obtrudes on the third person narration: "she was still in the bathroom when the man from the Angliskii Club brought a meat pie, a rice pudding, and her adolescent buttocks" (BS, 163). A description of Paduk's social theory of homogenization contains a wisp of Krug's 24</page><page sequence="4">vision of Olga: "If, for instance, a given amount of water were contained in a given number of heterogeneous bottles-wine bottles, flagons and vials of varying shape and size, and all the crystal and gold scent bottles that were reflected in her mirror, the distribution of the liquid would be uneven and unknown" (BS, 75). Something is going on here which cannot simply be explained away as an artistic bag of tricks.9 The fact that Bend Sinister's plot structure is a circle, the "I" standing at a window at the end flowing into the "I" standing at a window at the beginning, might remind us of Finnegans Wake. And, most impor- tantly, the Wake is a dream in which one voice breaks in upon another, one story intrudes upon another, all whirling around in the mind of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker.'0 I would contend that Nabokov's novel is a dream too, in which the mind of Adam Krug, whose name means "circle" in Russian and "jug" in German, encompasses and contains it all, with the help of the artist Nabokov. The pronouns change because Krug is dream- ing the dream and participating in it as a character at one and the same time. There are several recognizable moments throughout the novel in which Krug is dreaming, and in Chapter Five Nabokov comments that there is someone else involved: "a nameless, mysterious genius who took advantage of the dream to convey his own peculiar code message ... the presence of someone in the know" (BS, 64), who is identified in the Introduction as: "an anthropomorphic deity impersonated by me" (BS, xii). Krug and this deity are virtually the same. Joyce said that he did not know much about Vico beyond using him for all he was worth, and Nabokov might have said the same about Joyce. As Joyce organizes the elements of Earwicker's dream, so too does Nabokov work with those of Krug. As dream, Bend Sinister is not meant to be realistic, despite its very real indictment of Paduk's regime. It is even more a study of: "the beating of Krug's loving heart" (BS, viii), a tribute to his love for his wife Olga and son David. Near the end of the novel Krug becomes half aware of what his life has meant, and he thinks: "I might start writing the unknown thing I want to write; unknown, except for a vague shoe-shaped outline, the infusorial quiver of which I feel in my restless bones ... when you are trying to remember something or understand something or find some- thing" (BS, 157). Krug does not have the time to write, but Nabokov does, and in Bend Sinister he creates the artistic dream, the dream of art, which allows us to accept and deal with the past, to transcend pain, to realize love. Art, the reconstruction of the past, enables one to set in proper perspective, to triumph over, the pain of the present. "It takes something better than a paintbrush to create the sense of compact reality backed by a plausible past, of logical continuity, of picking up the thread of life at the exact point where it was dropped" (BS, 84). Not only is the novel studded with Krug's actual dreams, but dream effects permeate its structure. After spending hours getting to Quist's antique shop on the outskirts of the city, Krug can step through a hidden door and walk into his own backyard in a matter of minutes. At a most crucial moment, Linda cannot hear what the police who have captured David are shouting, and they cannot hear her. Krug's viewing of the film of his son's dismemberment and death almost certainly has to be a 25</page><page sequence="5">nightmare. And just as Krug will awaken from the terrible dream that has troubled so many of us: the examination is suddenly this morning and we have not studied or come to class in weeks, so too is the madness of Krug mercifully imposed by the artistic deity. It happens: "just after Krug had fallen through the bottom of a confused dream and sat up on the straw with a gasp" (BS, 233). The plot is not coherent and consecutive because it is often super- ceded by that oblate shape: a puddle, an inkstain, a blot, which means nothing in itself but which shows that Krug's life does have a pattern. Krug's memories of Olga pulsate beneath the fragmented narrative and often burst to the surface, clarifying the chaos and confusion around him. This is why she shows up in Paduk's memorandum, on the road to the hospital where David has been murdered, and that is why, as that final moth: "Olga's rosy soul, emblemized already in an earlier chapter [Nine], bombinates in the damp dark at the bright window of my room" (BS, xiii). The "my" is the possessive of both Krug and Nabokov. The dream form can incorporate everything. Though at first, like Pascal, Krug is terrified by: "those mirrors of infinite space qui m'effrayent, Blaise, as they did you, and where Olga is not" (BS, 61), this is a dream, and: "There were quite a number of these serial Krugs" (BS, 103). As he moves toward an acceptance of her death, with the dream vision of Olga mechanically taking herself apart at the dressing table, he eventually can create the picture of Olga as a girl of fifteen, the most charming and most fictional of them all since he did not know her at that time. He creates her anew. No matter what Krug may ultimately know or not know, the reader can see Krug's totality: "the whole suffused with consciousness, which is the only real thing in the world and the greatest mystery of all" (BS, 188). The dream novel that Adam Krug and Vladimir Nabokov con- struct is much the same as those put together by Boris Godunov- Cherdyntsev, Humbert Humbert, Sebastian Knight's brother V., and Ada and Van Veen. What it represents to Nabokov is: "a rent in his [Krug's] world leading to another world of tenderness, brightness and beauty" (BS, ix), a blow struck for meaning in the face of brutality, exile, loss, and death. Within Adam Krug, the novelist discerns a shape in dream which even he might not have expected: "the average vessels are not as simple as they appear: it is a conjuror's set and nobody, not even the enchanter himself, really knows what and how much they hold" (BS, 79). Though Nabokov said: "James Joyce has not influenced me in any manner what- soever,''2 he did admit that: "Ulysses towers over the rest of Joyce's writings, and in comparison to its noble originality and unique lucidity of thought and style the unfortunate Finnegans Wake is nothing but a form- less and dull mass of phony folklore, a cold pudding of a book, a persistent snore in the next room, most aggravating to the insomniac I am."13 Just the same, even in his insomnia, Finnegans Wake seems to have taught Nabokov something about dream, and it is finally the dream which tells us so much that we need to know about Olga and Adam Krug.
