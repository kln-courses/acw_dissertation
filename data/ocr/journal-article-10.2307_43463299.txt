<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LONG WAY TO GOPHER PRAIRIE Sinclair Lewis's Apprenticeship JOHN T. FLANAGAN WHEN Street can public burst Sinclair in upon October, Lewis's the Ameri- 1920, Main Street burst upon the Ameri- can public in October, 1920, it not only provided a fictional channel for the stream of public discontent with economic and social conditions, but it initiated a series of realistic books which have collectively been called the revolt from the village. Obviously it was not the first attempt of this kind in Ameri- can fiction. Hamlin Garland and E. W. Howe several decades before, Dreiser at the turn of the century, Zona Gale only two years before Lewis - all had antic- ipated Main Street in their naturalistic representations of ordinary people against a shabby background, and all had produced significant books which were quite as effective as Lewis's indict- ment of Gopher Prairie even though they lacked his peculiar combination of satire and caustic humor. But there can be no question that Lewis's novel was the first factual treatment of the American rural community to attract large public re- sponse. The ripeness of the time was a major factor in the success of Main Street . The novel appeared at the precise hour when readers suddenly freed from the tensions of a world war and conscious of the need for self-examination were willing and almost avid to learn the truth about themselves. A decade earlier Main Street would have made small impression upon the complacency of a public dedicated to material gain and convinced of the jus- tice of the status quo, even as Zona Gale's Birth attracted little attention as late as 1918. In 1920 Lewis's reportorial skill, his gusto, his grand scorn, and his inti- mate knowledge of the small town per- suaded people to read Main Street even though it mirrored their own banalities. All this is not to deny the solid merits of the novel, which remains one of Lewis's best achievements and one of the influential novels of the twentieth cen- tury. Nevertheless, although Lewis's literary photography was both accurate and full and although his skill made the small town the temporary cynosure of the American reading public, the enor- mous and sudden success of Main Street was partly circumstantial. The really surprising thing about the novel is not its popular reception but the fact that it was the author's sixth published work of fiction under his own name and that in substance, in treatment, and in tone 403</page><page sequence="2">404 SOUTHWEST REVIEW it is a far cry from the five novels that preceded it.* One may well wonder why Sinclair Lewis at the age of thirty-five suddenly reversed his field. As a youth in Sauk Center, Minnesota, as an undergraduate at Yale, as an enthu- siastic if temporary partisan of Upton Sinclair's Helicon Hall community, as a free-lance writer submitting poetry and prose to any kind of magazine which would publish him, Lewis was essentially a romantic. The Sauk Center of his boy- hood, a small community on the fringe of the Minnesota prairie, lay in a region notable for woods and lakes. Presum- ably Lewis saw and understood less of nature than did the poet Wordsworth; certainly he never rhapsodized over it and was congenitally incapable of pan- theistic reverence. But like any normal lad in a small town he was aware of it and possibly became conscious of it at unusual times and places through his habit of occasionally accompanying his father, a country physician, on his calls. For excitement Lewis persistently turned away from the street and the play- ground to books and read widely in much the same sort of literature that had ap- pealed to young William Dean Howells in Hamilton, Ohio. Indeed, Sherwood Anderson remarked in his Memoirs that Lewis seemed never to have participated in the thrills and pleasures of the small town. There was certainly less of the rebel than of the escapist in the tall, freckled, red-headed graduate of the Sauk Center High School who, after an interlude of exploratory reading at Ob- * Probably only bibliographers know that Lewis's first published novel (1912) was a story about a boy aviator written under the pseudonym of Tom Graham and entitled Hike and the Aeroplane. erlin Academy, matriculated at Yale in 1903. At New Haven Lewis was notable for habits of seclusion and an addiction to poetry. He roomed off the campus in an old boardinghouse, cut off from the gar- rulities of the undergraduates, and he lived a little apart from the eddies of campus life. Geographical separation probably implemented the social separa- tion induced by Lewis's reputation as socialist and agnostic. But he was already famous for his voracious passion for books - William Rose Benêt, later his roommate in California, doubts that any undergraduate ever withdrew as many volumes from the Yale library - and it was romantic poetry, even medieval tales and legends, which held his fancy. A Yale classmate, Leonard Bacon, claims that he always expected Lewis to earn fame as a poet rather than as a satirical novelist, and that at one time Lewis seriously considered composing an epic. Even his early contributions to the Yale Courant and the Yale Literary Magazine were usually metrical, and his first work to appear in general periodicals was lyric or descriptive verse of a commonplace sort which he contributed to magazines like the Sunset , the Overland , and the Century. The reader to whom Lewis is known only as caustic reporter would hardly trust his eyes were he to turn back to the files of the Minneapolis Bellman of 1911 and there read a tale entitled "The Way to Rome." Set in the days of Pope Boniface, the story concerns two travel- ers en route to Rome to participate in the papal jubilee. One wayfarer is a jongleur, who talks blithely and freely about the charms of his way of living; the other is a minor cleric who is convinced that the monk's position in life is ideal. But</page><page sequence="3">A LONG WAY TO GOPHER PRAIRIE 405 as each listens to the unfolding of the other's story he begins to question his own choice of vocation, and the story ends with the two travelers exchanging their professions. The road to Rome is certainly more than an ocean removed from the highway leading to Gopher Prairie. This strong streak of literary ro- manticism only confirmed in Lewis his passion for travel and his curiosity about the other side of the thoroughfare. Even before graduation a feverish restlessness afflicted him. Like the Mr. Wrenn of his novel he worked his way across the Atlantic on a cattle boat and thus made his first acquaintance with Europe. In 1907 he took time off from college to journey steerage to Panama in the hope of finding a job in the Canal Zone. His interest in Utopian experimentation led him to flee from the classroom to try out socialistic living. And after perma- nently departing from Y ale he left a trail of jobs behind him across the continent. One of the minor paradoxes in Lewis's career is that he even looked with interest once on an academic career and toyed with the notion of taking a Ph.D. in English. Lewis's years as a free-lance writer, publisher's reader, editor, and feature writer saw him located on both coasts and doing a wide variety of hackwork. In the summer of 1908 he worked on the Waterloo, Iowa, Courier . In Carmel, California, he roomed, picnicked, and wrote with William Rose Benêt, who has testified to the amazing fertility of the Lewis imagination even in those days, a fertility paralleled only by the spate of words poured out by the embryonic nov- elist. He contributed verse and prose to west coast periodicals and was a telegra- phic editor in San Francisco until dis- charged for incompetence. Back in New York he read manuscripts for a publish- ing firm, wrote advertising, and worked at a novel piecemeal while commuting daily from Port Washington. It was only after several stories had been accepted by the Saturday Evening Post that Lewis was financially and physically stable enough to settle down anywhere. He himself has asserted that until he pur- chased a farm in Vermont in 1928 he had never owned any real estate. This febrile instability has remained dominant throughout his life. If he never equalled Mark Twain's record of crossing the Atlantic twenty or more times, he has certainly roamed up and down the land until his familiarity with city and crossroads hamlet can be as- sumed. Only recently Lewis bought a house in Duluth and announced that he was returning to Minnesota to live, a decision quite in harmony with his known penchant for collecting books dealing with the history and culture of his native state. But not long after the publication of Cass Timberlane Lewis sold his house in Duluth and returned to New York. As Carl Van Doren once pointed out, Lewis is bored and disgusted by society, yet his temperament unfits him for solitude so that an occasional return to metropolitan life is imperative. Lewis's passion for novelty and excite- ment has led him from place to place in his physical life just as it has induced him to try twenty or more different themes in his fiction. Continuity and long-time devotion to place or subject have never been his forte. IEWIs's ¿ W renn FIRST appeared ROMANCE, in 1914. Our The Mr. ¿ W renn , appeared in 1914. The pro- tagonist is an underpaid clerk in a New York novelty house, a lonely man of</page><page sequence="4">406 SOUTHWEST REVIEW thirty-four who craves friendship and whose longing for glamor and romance impels him to feed upon travel literature. He devours steamship company bro- chures, timetables, advertising pamphlets. Finally when the sale of an inherited farm brings him a thousand dollars he determines to take the great adventure. He gives up his job and secures passage to England on a cattle boat as butler to the steers. His voyage is somewhat more successful than might be anticipated, since he does his share of the chores and not only stands the ribbing to which he is submitted but actually outfights a bully who has been annoying him. In England, however, he has little money left and small knowledge of what to see or do. Something of a lost figure, Wil- liam Wrenn eventually gets to London and mopes around boardinghouses until he meets Istra Nash, a disappointed American artist who out of pure ennui takes up Wrenn and patronizes him. For a time his meek devotion satisfies her and he is enraptured by her attention, but when she flees back to Paris, there is nothing for Wrenn to do but to return to New York and ask for his old job again. Occasional flurries of dissatisfac- tion occur but on the whole Wrenn's wanderlust has been curbed; he has seen Europe and is a traveled man. The rest of the novel - showing him reoccupying his New York niche, changing boarding- houses, meeting Istra Nash once again, and finally marrying a fellow boarder - adds little to the portrait. Wrenn is the romanticist and rebel, however inoffen- sive he may seem, ultimately conforming to pattern. The basic romantic mould of his four subsequent novels Lewis established here. There is the lowly protagonist without education or wealth feebly protesting against life as it is, bored by daily routine yet rarely able to escape from it, con- stantly envisaging a rosy and exciting future. There is the sense of restlessness, with the implied need of change. There is the one affirmation of protest, the one act of rebellion, after which the char- acter sinks back into his rut with wings slightly scorched. Above all there is the novelist's sympathy and compassion for his protagonist. William Wrenn is pa- thetic and shabby and a bit moronic, but he is not ridiculous. Lewis saved his scorn for Babbitt and Elmer Gantry. InTbeT rail of the Hawk , 1915, Lewis through the medium of the airplane wrote a novelized travelog quite in keep- ing with his own instability. Carl Eric- son, a small town lad from Joralemon, Minnesota, has no prospects save an interest in and a way with machinery. He does reasonably well in school and endures part of a year at Plato College until its narrow sectarianism drives him to revolt. Subsequently he is an auto- mobile mechanic and chauffeur in Chi- cago, a stock company actor in Virginia, a saloon porter in New York, a job- hunter in Panama, and an aviation stu- dent in California. Machinery and speed fascinate him and in short order he be- comes a pilot, then a barnstorming per- former at fairs and race tracks, and eventually the winner of a cross-country race. Carl Ericson the blond country boy has become Hawk Ericson the famous flier. But various factors such as fatal accidents to his former associates, the general dubiety in which aviation is held, and the outbreak of the World War cause him to retire from competitive fly- ing and to resort to the less hazardous work of promoting an automobile equip- ped with camping devices. At the end of the novel, as the guns boom in Europe,</page><page sequence="5">A LONG WAY TO GOPHER PRAIRIE 407 Carl and his bride start off on a selling trip to South America. The Trail of the Hawk has much of the gusto commonly found in Lewis's fiction. There is incessant movement, frequent change of locale, the excite- ment of a new transportational medium, the romance of the new air age. Ericson, a confirmed extrovert, lives for the mo- ment only. As he tells his wife, ".For us, I believe, it's change and keep going " Savoring life deeply, he spends his own energy recklessly. As he expresses it, "How bully it is to be living, if you don't have to give up living in order to make a living." Conceivably this ap- proximates the philosophy of Lewis him- self in 1915 as he developed it in one of his most nearly autobiographical novels. The Trail of the Hawk as a story bounces along from one scene to another without much causality. Characterization suffers because Lewis does not bother to give his people dimensions and because he is so eager to dart to something new. Like his protagonist he is so bespelled by the glamor and novelty of flying that the backgrounds become blurred. Even a Lewis narrative seldom gallops as it does here. The next novel, The Job , 1916, is Lewis's best achievement before Main Street and of all the early books comes closest to the later realistic portrayals. It is the story of Una Golden, daughter of a lawyer in a small Pennsylvania town, who through her father's early death is thrown upon her own resources. The Goldens were members of the town's aris- tocracy despite Lew Golden's improvi- dence, and when Una begins to look for a job she finds that there are certain things a genteel young lady cannot do. Panama, Pennsylvania, offers little that is both respectable and remunerative, and eventually friends urge Una to come to New York. There she pre- pares herself for office life by study- ing stenography; necessity, not choice, compels her to become a career woman. Una holds various positions, gradually bettering herself, and by a combination of persistence and intel- ligence establishes herself in the busi- ness world. Once indeed she tries mar- riage as an escape but discovers that her husband is both grossly sensual in his tastes and consistently unfaithful to her. When Una consents to marry an adver- tising man whom she once youthfully admired it is only upon the understand- ing that neither his career nor hers shall be interrupted. Already deeply hurt by certain personal experiences, Una is un- willing to sacrifice the independence and the economic security which life has com- pelled her to achieve under the threat of perishing. It is notable that Una is neither a feminist nor a materialist by conviction; she is exposed to much social- ist talk and her own observations pro- duce a mild belligerence in her, but she never becomes a crusader for the rights of women, like a Floyd Dell heroine, nor an esthetic reformer, like Lewis's own Carol Kennicott. Her creed is a defense mechanism produced by external forces. Woman in the business world was a theme that definitely interested Lewis. In no other early novel did he hew so close to the main line and limit himself so strictly in locale. Una is typical of thousands of girls, not unusually gifted and without distinct attractiveness, who as typists, clerks, or secretaries make a dreary living and struggle for small ad- vances in pay. Each enjoys her small ro- mance, even as Una finds Walter Babson, but in general they succumb to endless and debilitating routine. The various jobs</page><page sequence="6">408 SOUTHWEST REVIEW that Una holds until she becomes man- ager of a hotel chain allow Lewis to pic- ture different facets of business life and at the same time to capitalize on his re- portorial skill. If Una is not an engag- ing heroine, she is convincingly and faithfully drawn. Two other novels preceded Main Street : The Innocents , 1917 , and Free Air, 1919. The first of these was written, according to the author's prefatory note, for those who still enjoy Dickens and still love old people and children. An innocu- ous and strangely naïve tale, it deals with the Applebys, "almost old," who live in a New York flat and are devoted to each other. Seth Appleby has clerked in a shoestore for many years and has earned a modest living. Annually the couple spend a summer vacation with the Tubbs's on Cape Cod, the men catching crabs and playing cribbage together, the women cooking and cleaning and gossip- ing about millinery fads. But Seth enjoys these two-week outings so much that it occurs to him that he and his wife might operate a teashop on the Cape and thus spend all their time in rural sur- roundings instead of only visiting there once a year. The Applebys plunge into this venture enthusiastically but quickly discover that the successful operation of a teashop exceeds both their experience and their capacity. When one of the local celebrities loudly ridicules their estab- lishment they decide to close up the shop and for the time being visit their daughter in upstate New York. But life with the daughter and her vulgarly suc- cessful husband proves likewise unpleas- ant. The Applebys sneak back to New York, where for some time they live meagerly and so close to starvation that once they go to sleep with the gas jet open. Seth, however, determines not to die by asphyxiation, and then he and his wife make their great decision, resolving to take a pedestrian tour to the South and West, living on the bounty of farmers, doing small chores in return for meals, trusting their future destiny to prov- idence. The rest of the book is sheer romance. The apple-cheeked old man with the high spirits and the grandmotherly old woman find farmers, housewives, and merchants alike compassionate, and only seldom do they suffer real hardship. Perhaps the most fantastic incident is their stumbling upon a hobo jungle, where Mother Appleby takes over, su- pervises the cooking, does the sewing and cleaning, and inaugurates a moral as well as a physical regeneration. Lewis brings the book to a triumphant conclu- sion by having the Applebys become famous pedestrians, whose very appear- ance brings celebrity to a small town, and by allowing Seth to become a part- ner, without capital, in a small shoeshop to which he brings instant prosperity. The Appleby trek to fortune has finally proved successful. Free Air as a piece of art is even less plausible than The Innocents , but com- ing only a year before Lewis's presenta- tion of Gopher Prairie it has consider- able interest. Here a transcontinental automobile trip (following closely, as a matter of fact, Lewis's own route to Seattle) supplants the aviation theme of The Trail of the Hawk , but there is the same emphasis on travel and rapid shift of scene. In addition Free Air has a con- ventional boy-meets-girl and boy-pur- sues-girl plot. Claire Boltwood, driving her father from New York to Seattle, finds her roadster bogged down in prairie gumbo somewhere between Schoenstrom and Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. A Ger-</page><page sequence="7">A LONG WAY TO GOPHER PRAIRIE 409 man farmer is about to extricate the car at an exorbitant price when Milt Dag- gett, a Schoenstrom mechanic, comes along in his flivver and hastens to the rescue. The Boltwoods are duly grateful and casually drive on, but Milt is fasci- nated and impetuously decides to follow them to Seattle. He becomes the feudal knight, jalopy style. When Claire's car develops motor trouble Milt appears out of nowhere to oil the distributor and send the roadster on ahead. When Claire gives a wandering hobo a lift and then finds herself unable to get rid of him, Milt again materializes out of the horizon and knocks the man off the running board. In Yellowstone Park a bear be- comes unpleasantly intimate with the Boltwoods, but Milt gallantly removes the intruder; and subsequently when the roadster's brakes fail, Milt devises a log- drag to slow the car's descent. These prac- tical tests Milt passes easily; things are different in Seattle when he is flung into a concert-attending, tea-drinking society and when he has to compete with a Princeton graduate for Claire's affec- tions. But Milt is indefatigable and Sin- clair Lewis is generous to his hero. Obvi- ously Milt's devotion cannot go unre- warded, and in a burst of resentment at Jeff Saxton's superciliousness Claire de- cides to marry Milt. Presumably the girl from Brooklyn Heights and the boy from Schoenstrom will live happily ever after. This tale offers nothing but conven- tional romance against a background of automobiling with, in 1919, the con- comitants of bad roads, highway obstacles, and motor trouble. The story of the western swain who by his prac- ticality and persistence won the eastern girl away from her social-register suitor was trite long before Lewis attempted it. But there is some originality in making the hero a garage mechanic, even though his impulsive pursuit of a transient girl to Seattle seems highly implausible; and the use of the Minnesota background in the initial chapters of the book is signifi- cant in Lewis's later development. IT quite is obvious explains that Lewis's none sudden of these blossom- novels quite explains Lewis's sudden blossom- ing forth as a realist. He had some years previously begun a story about the vil- lage virus which was to use the lawyer Guy Pollock as protagonist, but this was thrown aside, and the jejune character- ization and stereotyped plots of his pub- lished novels hardly prepare the way for Main Street. Yet no artist ever springs forth from the sea of time in full con- trol of his powers, and there are signs in even the flimsiest of his early novels that point to his mature work. Amid banality and crudeness, there are streaks of vivid realism and touches of satire that antic- ipate the later Lewis. Individual por- traits, parenthetical remarks, bits of ob- servation, expository synopses frequently suggest the maturing satirist and prove, as Carl Van Doren asserted, that Lewis was becoming saturated with knowledge of American life. Before this saturation point was reached Lewis was unable to present his complete picture of the Amer- ican village and perforce contented him- self with popular fiction. Before he was ready to depict hypocrites and charlatans and bores he chose such feeble protagon- ists as William Wrenn and Carl Ericson and Milt Daggett, but in the very act of telling their stories he revealed occa- sional touches of his later craftsmanship. Thus little in the more famous novels can eclipse the terse characterization of Lew Golden on the first page of The Job :</page><page sequence="8">410 SOUTHWEST REVIEW He carried a quite visible moustache- comb and wore a collar, but no tie. On warm days he appeared on the street in his shirt-sleeves, and discussed the comparative temperatures of the past thirty years with Doctor Smith and the Mansion House 'bus driver. He never used the word "beauty" except in reference to a setter-dog - beauty of words or music, of faith or rebellion, did not exist for him. He rather fancied large, ambitious, banal, red-and-gold sunsets, but he merely glanced at them as he straggled home, and remarked that they were "nice." He believed that all Parisians, artists, millionaires, and Socialists were immoral. His entire system of theology was comprised in the Bible, which he never read, and the Methodist Church, which he rarely attended; and he desired no system of economics beyond the current platform of the Republican party. He was aimlessly indus- trious, crotchety but kind, and almost quixo- tically honest. Lew Golden promptly disappears from the novel, which is Una's story, but his portrait is a clear adumbration of the George F. Babbitt to come. In similar fashion S. Alcott Wood, president of Plato College in The Trail of the Hawk , anticipates Lewis's later strictures on the clergy. President Wood was an honest, anxious body, something like a small, learned, Scotch linen-draper. He was given to being worried and advisory and to sitting up till midnight in his unventilated library, grinding at the task of putting new wrong meanings into perfectly obvious statements in the Bible. He was a series of circles - round head with smooth gray hair that hung in a bang over his round forehead; round face with round red cheeks; absurdly heavy gray mustache that almost made a circle about his puerile mouth; round button of a nose; round heavy shoulders; round little stomach in a gray sacksuit; round dumplings of feet in con- gress shoes that were never quite fresh- blacked or quite dusty. A harassed, honorable, studious, ignorant, humorless, joke-popping, genuinely conscientious thumb of a man. His prayers were long and intimate. This president of a small Baptist col- lege was rigidly orthodox in religion and morals; the doctrine of evolution horri- fied him and smoking was a cardinal sin. He exemplifies the Bible Belt educator who for years was H. L. Mencken's special target (and Elmer Gantry was dedicated to Mencken). Two minor portraits from The Trail of the Hawk further confirm this early satirical tendency. The dean at Plato Col- lege was "a young, collegiate climber, with a clipped mustache, a gold eye-glass chain over one ear, a curt voice, many facts, a spurious appreciation of music, and no mellowness. He was a graduate of the University of Chicago, and aggressively proud of it." A school- teacher who taught youthful Carl Eric- son did not hesitate to use feminine weapons upon the lad. "For after irritat- ing a self-respecting boy into rudeness by pawing his soul with damp, puffy hands, she would weep. She was a kind, honest, and reverent bovine." Almost equally revealing of the Lewis to come is the type of character of whom he approves or the occasional character- istic which he ascribes to certain figures as a kind of leaven. Hawk Ericson, ex- trovert that he is, intermittently reflects on life and develops a mild agnosticism which his creator relishes. It was also his acceptance of socialistic doctrines and his support of the teacher who espoused them that led to his departure from Plato College. Istra Nash, the artist and Bohem- ian who so fascinated William Wrenn and whom Lewis reintroduces in The Trail of the Hawk , represents urban sophistication in opposition to the small town insularity of Gertrude Cowles. And in Bone Stillman, the agnostic farmer</page><page sequence="9">A LONG WAY TO GOPHER PRAIRIE 411 who lives alone in a dirty house and reads Karl Marx to his dogs, Lewis pictures the social rebel who challenges all conven- tions and is both feared and ostracized. There is a close identity between Still- man and Miles Bjornstam, the red-headed Swedish plumber in Main Street who scandalizes the town but who is too handy with tools to be ignored. If Lewis devoted considerable space to bourgeois dullness he also praised with consistency the occa- sional rebels who scorned social tyranny and boiler-plate thinking. All the Lewis novels have been notable for their rapid narrative, but even in the earliest the novelist took time to under- score certain scenes or to suggest the tone of locality in a flashing phrase. Walter Babson, in The Joby attends Jon- athan Edwards College in Iowa and is expelled for boisterous conduct, but he could get little nourishment from col- lege classes "which were as hard and un- palatable as dried codfish." Carl Ericson was equally displeased at Plato College where he found the classwork pure rot: "arbitrary mathematics, antiquated botany, hesitating German, and a veri- table military drill in the conjugation of Greek verbs conducted by a man with a non-com. soul, a pompous, sandy- whiskered manikin with cold eyes and a perpetual cold in the nose, who had inflicted upon a patient world the four- millionth commentary on Xenophon." Boardinghouse scenes in Our Mr. W renn and business offices in The Job give Lewis ample opportunity to picture bil- ious wallpaper, moth-eaten furniture, stale-smelling rooms, and heavily jocular minor executives. A further example of this kind is the collection of tearoom furnishings foisted upon the innocent Applebys just before they inaugurate their ill-fated restaurant on Cape Cod. Tea-cups and saucers gilded like shaving- mugs and equally thick. Golden-oak chairs of mid-Chautauquan patterns, with backs of saw-mill Heppel white; chairs of cane and rattan with fussy scrolls and curlicues of wicker, the backs set askew. Reed tables with gollops of wicker; plain black wooden tables that were like kitchen tables once removed; folding-tables that may have been suitable to card-playing, if you didn't play anything more exciting than casino. Flat silver that was heavily plated except where it was likely to wear . . . Dark blue plates with warts on the edges and melancholy landscapes painted in the centers . . . Tea- cartons that had the most inspiring labels; cocoa that was bitter and pepper that was mild; preserves that were generous with hayseed and glucose. But in connection with the major novels the attempts of Lewis to picture small town life in the early stories are most revealing. The first dozen chapters of The Trail of the Hawk picture the small Minnesota community of Jorale- mon and the college community of Plato. The opening pages of Free Air introduce the reader to the hamlet of Schoenstrom, a village with a brick general store, a frame hotel, a farm-machinery agency, a church, three saloons, and the Red Trail Garage which services cars, repairs binders and sewing machines, and offers weekly the skill of a veterinarian. In chapter four Lewis sketches Gopher Prairie, a town of five thousand peo- ple, the same Gopher Prairie with muddy roads and bathless hotel rooms which was to become the cynosure of thousands of readers. These four small towns, incompletely limned as they are, came to represent the arche- type of the American fictional hamlet. They crouch on the edge of the prairie gumbo, which Lewis defines as "mud mixed with tar, flypaper, fish glue, and well-chewed, chocolate-covered cara-</page><page sequence="10">412 SOUTHWEST REVIEW mels." They offer markets and bright lights and places of entertainment to the adjacent farmers whose labors support them. They are dull and stolid, inquisi- tive and censorious, garish and crude. To a visiting Claire Boltwood looking for a room with a bath or to the new- comer Carol Kennicott hoping to reform a community they are insufferably dreary. On the other hand, a Dr. Will Kennicott finds them friendly and com- fortable, and when they are inflated to the size of Zenith in the state of Winne- mac they become the natural habitat of the species Babbitt. IT culed is notable the protagonists that Lewis of seldom his ridi- culed the protagonists of his appren- tice novels. William Wrenn and Hawk Ericson and Milt Daggett and even Father and Mother Appleby are not made absurd, probably because the genuine romanticist was a figure too close to the author's own character. Wrenn's pa- thetic visions of escape from routine, Ericson's passion to fly, Daggett's fascina- tion with a girl who suddenly appeared on his horizon - these Lewis could sympa- thize with because they were genuine and because they represented an effort to grasp something new and something ex- citing. The desire for change, for travel, for freedom was always close to his own heart and epitomized much of his own past life. Lewis even allows Babbitt a thin romantic touch when he pictures him visualizing a little fairy who seems to beckon him into a different existence. Perhaps the fairy sometimes assumes the semblance of Babbitt's stenographer, an inescapably anthropomorphic touch, but she is constantly there to suggest flight from the dreary present. The romantic, sanguinely assured that over the horizon or around the corner things are better or at least more exciting, is not the target of Lewis's ire; he reserved his corrosive pho- tography for different game. The best known figures of Lewis's later fiction are those with whom the author has least sympathy: Elmer Gantry, Dodsworth, Ann Vickers. Pretense, hypocrisy, demagoguery, the traditional butts of the satirist and Lewis's prime concern in the later novels, do not figure largely in the books pre- ceding Mam Street . Nor had he then begun to level his sights obviously on the businessmen and the clergy. Occasional malicious thrusts are directed at teachers, college executives, salesmen, farmers - particularly at those whose training or whose profession should have made them skeptical and alert; but there are no full- dimensioned portraits. Possibly this is in part the result of differences in method. The typical Lewis novel after 1920 is a biography, a major segment of the pro- tagonist's life story being told in great fulness of detail, and everything else - other characters, situations, background - being subordinated to the chief pur- pose. As a consequence the story is some- what impeded in narrative speed, and although the character is still presented externally he is given breadth and form. Indeed, one of the sharpest differences between Lewis's early novels and his later ones is the change of tempo. Where The Trail of the Hawk hurtles along with the speed of Carl Ericson's airplane, a mass of relevant but static details slows up Arrowsmitb or It Can't Happen Here . Lewis even requires two chapters merely to show Babbitt arising, shaving, dressing, and preparing to leave for the office - incidentally one of the memora- ble passages in modern American fiction. There is one other way in which Lewis's early novels possess more than</page><page sequence="11">A LONG WAY TO GOPHER PRAIRIE 413 a superficial connection with those that succeeded them. Just as the author's satirical observation, his command of caustic humor, and his enormous vitality reveal themselves intermittently, so is Lewis's later style anticipated. Here in embryonic but unmistakable form is the exaggeration, the periodic distortion for effect, the extravagant analogies, the deliberate use of slang, and - to a lesser extent - the accurate mimicry, which distinguish both Lewis's writing and his conversation. That none of these quali- ties is developed enough to be conspicu- ous may be attributed to Lewis's careless composition, possibly to his conviction that his real task was not the writing of these intermediate volumes but the ab- sorbing of a tremendous fund of infor- mation about American life which he was to spew out in Main Street and its sequels. For in the final analysis all of Lewis's published fiction, even the relatively un- successful novels published before 1920, forms part of an American comedy which embraces the world of business, religion, politics, industry, education, and farming - an impressive whole with twenty or more parts picturing the na- tional scene. It was Lewis's decision to present this scene with the accent on scorn, on ridicule, on satire. He may even be, in Robert Cantwell's phrase, the historian of America's catastrophic going-to-pieces, with no remedy to offer for the decline he records.
