Miller Probably the most distinctive characteristic of classical utopian designs is the basic "humanitarian" bent of their value struc- tures. . . . And perhaps the most notable difference to be found between the classical system designers and their contemporary counterparts (system engineers, data processing specialists, computer manufactur- ers, and system designers) consists precisely in the fact that the humanitarian bent has disappeared. The dominant value orienta- tion of the utopian renaissance can best be described as "effi- ciency" rather than ''humanitarianism.''1 I. INTRODUCTION rrHE almost geometric expansion of published materials in recent 1 years indicates that our society is experiencing an informa- tion, as well as a population, explosion. Fortunately, a techno- logical revolution, centered around a species of machines gener- ically referred to as "the computer," is in progress and promises to increase man's capacity to accumulate, manipulate, store, retrieve, and transmit information. Dramatic confirmation of the dimen- sions of this new technology's capability is provided each time man reaches toward the moon and the planets beyond. Our ability to thrust an object countless miles into space would be of limited value without the associated technological resources to measure and manipulate its flight, monitor the performance of its various systems and the body functions of the people inside it, and com- # Professor of Law, University of Michigan.

A number of contemporary prophets have predicted that the advent of the new information transfer technologies will prove to be as significant as the invention of movable type.2 As they per- ceive the future, information will not be preserved as alphabetical imprints or pictures in a book but rather as holes in punch cards, magnetic fields on tapes or discs, electrical impulses moving through the memory core of a computer, and, perhaps, radiations generated in vats of complex chemicals. But this transition is bound to be accompanied by abrasive dislocations and deviations from traditional norms. For example, in recent years there has been a growing assrareness of the effects that certain applications of computer technology may have on individual privacy. The ponderousness of movable-type technology inhibited man's urge to collect and preserve information about his peers. But many people have voiced concern that the computer, with its insatiable appetite for information, its image of infallibiTity, and its inability to forget anything that has been stored in it, may become the heart of a surveillance system that will turn society into a transparent world in which our homes, our finances, and our associations will be bared to a wide range of observers.3 These fears have been exacerbated by the clarion in some quarters for the 2.

The purpose of this Article is to survey the new technology's implications for personal privacy and to evaluate the contemporary common-law and statutory pattern relating to data-handling. In the course of this examination, it will appraise the existing framework's capacity to deal with the problems created by society's growing awareness of the primordial character of information.4 The Article is intended to be suggestive; any attempt at definitiveness would be premature. Avowedly, it was written with the bias of one who believes that the new information technology has enormous long- range societal implications and who is concerned about the conse- quences of the notion that man shapes his tools and then they shape him. The assumption throughout is that the computer is not simply a sophisticated indexing machine, a miniaturized library, or an electronic abacus; it is the keystone of a new communications medium that eventually will have global dimensions. Thus, it would be overly simplistic to examine the computer-privacy issue from the perspective of a particular machine or group of machines operating in a federal office building, in the headquarters of one of the nation's major industrial complexes, or in the recesses of a great university. Indeed, the analogy between the forces that gave rise to the multifaceted regulation of the airlines, railroads, radio, and television and the problems that already are generating pressure for the regulation of computer transmissions and facilities seems obvious. It is against the template of the potential need for a com- prehensive regulatory scheme embracing some uses of the technology in both the public and private sectors that the question of protecting individual privacy in the computer age must be placed.

It is easy to under- stand why sc) many sectors of society have embraced the new tech- nology so eagerly. The computer's basic ability to store vast quan- tities of data and to retrieve or perform operations upon it in accordance with a programmed set of instructions7 enables the tech- nology to be employed fruitfully in virtually any activity that re- quires the systematic manipulation of large bodies of information. Perhaps the most dramatic aspect of the computer age has been the rate at which the technology has evolved. Computer 4'hard- ware"-loosely speaking, the physical elements of the machine- already has experienced three generations of development.8 As a result, the present-day computer designer is able to draw on a variety of memory devices including relatively slow storage media such as punch cards or magnetic tape, faster devices such as discs, and, more recently, magnetic cores9 that enable a computer to 6. At present there are over 40,000 computers in operation in the United States. This figure represents about 65 per cent of the total number of computers in the world. NEWSWEEK, Jan. 29, 1968, at 57. A more recent estimate puts the "computer population" at 67,200. ltussel, supra note 2, at 116. T. The following simplified description of a computer's capabilities was given by Dr. Emanuel R. Piore, Vice President of IBM, in Senate Hearings on Com puter Privacy 1 18: The memory device, the storage device of the computer, contains a large number of cells. Each of these can hold a single piece of infornlation, such as a number or a name in code. Each cell . . . has a nunlerical address. * . * * To process data, the computer can perfortn very rapidly such functions as these: It can move a piece of information frotn an input device to a memory cell; add the number in one memory cell to a number in another cell; send a copy of information in a memory cell to an output device. But before a computer can do anything whatsoever, someone must give it an organized sequence of instructions called a program. Each instruction specifies one of the basic functions which the computer can perform. And each instruction, like each piece of data, can be stored . . . in a ulemory cell of the machine. A user can put a program into the machine and thus gain command of it- in two ways, and only two. He can put it in by hand, through a set of keys and buttons at the console of the central part of the machine. Or he can put in a program which in turn can bring in a second program from any input deviceJ and give the second program temporary control.

As the requirements of modern science and industry provide the incentive for the hardware manufacturers to produce memories that can accommodate a billion bits of informa- tion irl a single system, researchers are turning to exotic storage media using devices such as lasers,ll photochromic materials respon- sive to ultraviolet light,l2 and complex chemical solutions.l3 The "software" of the electronic age the programs or instructions of the tasks that a given computer system is expected to perform. See Mayer, Com- puters on the Brain, ESQUIRE, Jan. 1969, at 100, 103, 148: The central distinction between different kinds of black boxes is whether they are primarily memory ("storage and retrieval") systems, which is what business needs, or primarily computational systems for research use. The computer which prepares the payroll simply churns forward through lists of names, slotting in as needed appropriate changes in salary data, hours worked, percentages for deduc- tion, etc. Though the memory function is vital, the memory device can con- veniently be a simple reel of magnetic tape, which gives a predetermined sequen- tial access rather than random access .... Other activities need the computer as a kind of super filing system, so deci- sions can be made on the basis of full information.... For this purpose, a memory on reels of magnetic tape is inadequate because the machine must do considerable checking back on afready processed data. But the electronic speeds of ., . magnetic cores are not regEuired; a mechanical whirling drum or disc with magnetic coatings will be sufficlently random and sufficiently fast.... Finally, a very different black box is required if the machine is to be used for immensely rapid computation of immense numbers of variables to control a rocket, or to guide an airplane into a socked-in airport .... This system demands an enormous random-access memory delivering its information at max- imum speed, because so many possible different programs must be available for processing depending on the results of prior computation. 10.

A working model of a system for storing information on plastic tape in the form of minute craters burned by a laser beam is described in A. WESTIN, PRIVACY AND FREEDOM 167 (1967). This process permits the storage of 645 million bits of data per square inch of tape, recorded at the rate of 12 million bits per second. A bit of in- founatioIl is described as follows in Furth, Computers, in COMPUTERS AND THE LAW 26 (American Bar Assn. Standing Comm. on Law &amp; Technology, 2d ed. 1969): Basically information is represented in the various components of a computer in a form which requires only two distinct states of a storage position: ON or OFF, 0 or 1. Such a system of representation is called "binary" and each position of storage is referred to as a "binary digit" or a "bit." 12. Univac has advertised that it has developed "a non-fatiguing photochromic material . . . that can be used as a reservoir for computer information. Exposure of this material to ultraviolet light records the information. The information can then be read with a low-intensity light beam ...." The potential reductions in storage space made possible by this process have led the company to speculate: "Someday it may be possible to store the medical records of every American in the space of a cold capsule. Or the tax records of the nation may fit in one file cabinet." TIME, Sept. 27, 1968, at 51. 13. Cf. Diebold, The New World Coming, SAT. 1{EV., July 23, 1966, at 17: "Looking ahead, we see important changes in technology such as chemical memories; Ruid and pneumatic systems that have instantaneous response; ability to store images, graphs, drawings and photographs, and to transmit them around the world."</page><page sequence="8">1096 Michigan Law Review [Vol. 67:1089 that control the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of informa- tion within the huge computer memories has undergone a com- parable transformation. Programs no longer are laboriously derived from highly personal and detailed computer languages useful and intelligible to only a few. Today's common programming languages such as FORTAN and COBOL are becoming the lingua franca of the new technocracy, enabling extraordinarily complex information- handling tasks to be performed in response to relatively simple instructions understood by virtually all machines. Sophisticated programs have been designed to edit raw data, to perform different operations in sequence with the contours of each step dictated by the results of the preceding process, to permit virtually instanta- neous random access to any given item of information stored in the memory, and to shift a computer's information-handling capacity among a number of users so rapidly that each can proceed with his work almost as if the machine were reacting only to his commands. Although there still are signiScant problems of system compatibility to be solved, it may not be long before computers are communicating with each other and with their operators in much the same manner as their operators communicate among themselves. Indeed, there are some programs that enable machines to "learn" as part of a process that is very similar to the socratic method of teaching.l4 14.

The error is apparently based upon an approxi- mation of pi which is incorrect past the fourth decimal. (3.1415927, not 3.1415899, is the correct approximation to seven places.) For reasons peculiar to ease of computer expression, the programmer may not have intended accuracy past the fourth decimal, but if so, the program should have called for an answer with fewer digits. Ed.] Professor Fano concludes: The important points to observe are that the information is provided in arbi- trary order and in a relatively free format and that the program can make nontrivial inferences from the available information and generate reasonable conjectures in the absence of complete information. The program is being in- structed in the way that people like to instruct other Ipeople, that is, by making statements and answering questions. Id. at 47.

Abram, and this writer have produced a computer-based dialogue to assist in teaching part of a first-year course in civil procedure. Although it was demonstrated at the 1968 annual meeting of the American Association of Law Schools and tested during March and April 1969 on approximately 150 first-year students at the University of Michigan Law School, it still must be considered experimental. Nonetheless, preliminary evaluation indicates a high level of receptivity on the part of the students and reasonable suc- cess in terms of educational values.

REV., July 23, 1966, at 17: Between 1963 and 1972 a single decade there will be a decrease of 85 per cent in the cost of completing a typical data-processing job. During this period, the cost of storage by magnetic tape will go down by 97 per cent; the cost of image storage by 96 per cent; and communications line costs, because of increased speeds of transmission, will decrease by 50 per cent. Even experts in the data-processing field frequently underestimate the potential mar- ket and rate of change; see, e.g., Hearings on the Coordination and Integration of Government Statistical Programs Before the Subcomm. on Economic Statistics of the Joint Economic Comm., 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 3, 7 (1967) (statement of Dr. Edgar S.

The Development of Time-Sharing The growth in concern over the interrelationship between com- puters and personal privacy directly parallels the development of increasingly efficient methods of utilizing data-processing equip- ment. When computers were first marketed commercially, they were designed to handle data-processing jobs sequentially to "batch process" different tasks. But this mode of operation leaves the heart of the machine idle during the period in which the data is being put into the system and again during the printout phase. In addi- tion, the machines are so fast that few organizations were able to generate enough work to keep them busy. Thus, it was apparent that customers were using only a fraction of the computer's poten- tial; in turn, the low level of computer use was a primary factor in the high cost of machine processing.24 The industry's solution was to connect several input-output terminals to the same machine, and to design a complex program that would enable the computer to switch its attention arnong the commands of the various users at very high speed.25 Thus, some users could be inputting data, others receiving the computer-pro- Technology, 2d ed. 1969).

This "time-sharing" procedure enabled users to employ the full capacity of the machine, and it gave each user the functional equiv- alent of his own computer at a greatly reduced cost. However, the simultaneous exposure of several distinct bodies of data in one information system created the risk that one user would gain access to another's files, either by accident or by design, and thus com- promise the privacy of fellow users or of third parties whose per- sonal data was being stored or manipulated in the time-share sys- tem.26 The next step in the maturation of time-sharing was to move the input-output terminals away from the central processor, to dis- perse them into strategic locations such as the regional offices of a national corporation or an important customer's place of business, and to link them with the computer's memory unit by communica- tions channels. This seemingly obvious development has enormous implications for the development of information transfer capacity. Observers of recent trends in data-processing assert that remote- access time-sharing is merely the Srst stage in the ultimate amal- gamation of computer and communications technologies.27 They [A] time-sharing computer requires an ''executive'l or "control" program.... The executive keeps the whole system running efficiently and in a sequence determined by priorities. It assigns actual computing time among its many users, say 200 milliseconds for each client on line.... The executive fetches the client's data or programs out of storage, and puts them back there once the client is finished. It also can prevent one user from interfering with the program of another and altering it or wiping it out-a facility that goes by the technical name of "memory protection." It keeps a record of who uses the machine, makes corrections, even gives helpful hints to unskilled users .... . . .

"Its complexity," says [Robert M. Fano, the project's organizer] ". . . is at the limit of human understanding." Part of this complexity, incidentally, is required by the need to maintain the security and privacy of each user's prograllls. "Experience has shown," Fano wrote grimly in a recent issue of the Journal of Engineering Ed ucation, "that vandalism within a time-sharing system and the forging of user accounts are to be expected in universities as well as elsewhere."

Equipped with more than 90 million input- output stations, this enormous computer can be commanded to provide any one of the 3 million billion "answers" it takes to connect any one of its stations telephones with any other and do it in a matter of seconds. It is a "real time" operation by definition and design. It should not be surprising, then, that the colllmunication and computer technologies should have much in common. Indeed, our newest electronic switch- ing systems, like computers, are internally programed and are endowed with the same kind of quasi-human memory ascribed to commercial computers. 31.

The conversion to digital transmission will greatly improve the capabilities of the telephone system as a data carrier: A regular telephone line used in home and ofiice does well if it carries 1,200 to 2,400 bits of data per second, enough for a Teletypewriter but slow for com- puters or facsimile transmission. BY comparison, one voice channel equivalent on a digital transmission system carries 56,000 bits per second about 22 times as much data as a normal voice channel. Id. at 84.

For example, it will be possible to dial only two digits to reach the few numbers that you call often. It will be possible to relay a call to another telephone if you are temporarily away.

In addition, the move- ment of this data among different machine systems over relatively low-security communications channels, such as telephone circuits, is certain to become more prevalent. Unfortunately, little is being done to insure that computerized data in central storage or transit is any safer from the intrusive activities of snoopers than private telephone conversations have been in the past. C. The Informatiort-Based Society Ever since the federal government's entry into the taxation and social-welfare spheres, increasing quantities of information have been elicited from citizens and recorded. Moreover, in recent years access to governmental largesse at all levels has depended in- creasingly upon a willingness to divulge private information. Brief reflection about the data acquisition implications of federal in- volvement in home-financing, urban renewal, and public health as well as the activities of the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Job and Peace Corps, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides graphic evidence of these trends. As information-recording processes have become cheaper and more efficient, this appetite for data has intensified and been accompanied by a predilection toward centralization and collation of file material. In accordance with a principle akin to Parkinson's Law, as capacity for information-handling increases there is a tendency to engage in more extensive manipulation and analysis of recorded data, which, in turn, motivates the collection of data pertaining to a larger number of variables.4l The availability of electronic data storage and retrieval has accelerated this pattern in a number of contexts; witness the expansion in the scope of questions on the 1960 and the proposed 1970 censuses42 and the ever-increasing number of government questionnaires to which individuals are subjected. It also is reasonable to assume that one consequence of increased computer capacity is that many governmental agexlcies will go beyond current levels of inquiry and begin to ask more complex, probing, and sensitive questions. Perhaps future inter- rogations will touch upon such subjects as associations with other 41. See Senate Hearings on Computer Privaq at 74-75 (statement of the author). 42.

The increased application of computer technology resulting from time-sharing, remote-access terminals, and other forms of cost reduction also is causing a profound change in the manner in which the industrial and academic sectors of our society regard informa- tion and the uses to which it is put. Perhaps this trend has man- ifested itself most clearly in the social sciences. Largely because of the computer, scholars in these disciplines are increasingly able to base their theoretical structures on mathematical models rather than on "intuitive feeling and casual empiricism."43 To construct and manipulate effective and sophisticated models44 of the environ- ment with the expectation of analyzing and predicting human behavior and natural or societal phenomena necessitates vast amounts of detailed information-"microdata"- rather than the broad and comparatively superficial summaries that social scientists traditionally have used.45 This is true partly because accurate de- scription of a complex system often requires investigation of an enormous number of potentially significant variables.46 In addition, there may be unsuspected relationships inherent in the data that 43. Ruggles, On the Needs and Values of Data Banks, in Symposium-Computers, Data Banks, and Individual Privacy, 53 MINN. L. REV. 211, 216 (1968). Professor Rug- gles describes the problems facing social scientists before the introduction of the com- puter: Where empirical research is undertaken, it generally tends to concern itself with observations of global aggregates or with very small samples of data to which the social scientist may have obtained access. This situation is not of the social scien- tists' own choosing. The kinds of information required for an understanding of the social system have not been available, and prior to the development of the computer would not have been usable even if they had been available. 44. The term "model" is generic, and encompasses a variety of techniques. Crosson &amp; Sayre, Modeling: Simulation and Replication, in THE MODELING OF MIND: COMPUTERS AND INTELLIGENCE 3 (1968), subdivide models into (1) replications, which reproduce some physical aspect of the original; (2) formalizations, which are symbolic repre- sentations of an original system that can be analyzed by paper-and-pencil mathematical operations; and (3) simulations, which, in contrast to formalizations, produce not a general solution but rather a statistical description of a large number of particular solutions for the more important variables. The simulation is the kind of model that most frequently requires the use of an electronic computer. For a simplified discussion of the methodology involved in making this kind of computer analysis, see Lozowick, Steiner, &amp; Miller, Law and Quantitative Multivariate Analysis: An Encollnter, 66 MICH.

Institutions of every description are turning to electronic data-processing to increase their information- handling capacity and to improve the efficiency of their operations.

In summarizing the typical evolution of a police data-processing system, the Report concludes that most agencies utilizing electronic data-processing began with relatively modest punched-card systems, then expanded them until that format became impractical, switching to electronic systems as funds became available.

This registry could contain such background information as education, employment, military service, and probation reports. Such files could also be used to provide basic data for assessing the effectiveness of the State's different correctional programs. 51. See, e.g., Hearings on Statistical Programs 129-30 (statement of Arthur M.

Now, however, policymaking is clearly a continuous matter, aimed to help promote steady growth and noninflationary prosperity all the time. An information system could be adequate in sounding the alarm to herald major disruptions and still fall far short of meeting the needs of our current policy strategy. * . * . A full employment economy also brings to the fore the interrelationship between monetary and fiscal policy. It increases the need for detailed information on the relation between financial flows and income-expenditure flows. This puts special emphasis on accurate and prompt flow-of-funds information that is inte- grated with the national income and product accounts. 52.

It may be a bit premature to conclude that "informa- tion is becoming the basic building block of society"55 or that "all forms of wealth result from the movement of information,"56 but there does seem to be considerable truth in the assertion that elec- tronic technology is making the world into a "global village"5 in which the domain of strictly private action is steadily being eroded.58 On the assumption that there are some intrinsically in demand factors distinct from . . . responses to expanded technical capability.

Ill. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY S THREAT TO PERSONAL PRIVACY A. The Individual's Loss of Control over Personal Information Privacy, as many commentators have noted, is a concept that is impossible to define59 or to fit into a coherent framework of legal doctrine.60 With greater frequency, however, lawyers and social scientists are expressing the view that the basic attribute of an effec- tive right to privacy is the individual's ability to control the flow of information concerning or describing him6l-a capability that often is essential to the establishment of social relationships62 and the supply it to banks holding our money and to organizations making payments to us. Or consider the census. The authors of the U.S. Constitution called for an "enumeration" of the population every 10 years ....................................... Many millions of citizens in 1960 had to answer 165 questions about their lives, purchasing habits, and incomes. And the pressure is growing to add a host of new inquiries such as ethnic origins, religious affiliation, schooling, et cetera .... 59. A typical complaint is the assertion that "[8ew concepts . . . are more vague or less amenable to definition and structured treatment than privacy. Under this emotional term march[es] a whole congeries of interests, some closely interrelated, some almost wholly unrelated and even inconsistent."

One of the clearest statements of this position can be found in OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, PRIVACY AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH 8-9 (1967): [W]hat is private varies for Pach person and varies from day to day and setting to setting. Indeed, the very core of the concept is the right of each individual to determine for himself in each particular setting or compartment of his life how much of his many-faceted beliefs, attitudes and behavior he chooses to disclose. Every person lives in several different worlds, and in each his mode of response may indeed must be different.... The right to privacy includes the freedom to live in each of these different roles without having his performance and aspira- tions in one context placed in another without permission.

Various guar- antees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one.... The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers "in any house" in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." The Fifth Amend- ment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

But a casual perusal of the testimony elicited by various congressional subcommittees66 and brief reflection on the intrusive capabilities of the new surveillance devices and information tech- nologies leads to the conclusion that these traditional safeguards on informational privacy no longer are reliable. In a computerized environment, the power to control the flowv of data about oneself can be compromised in a variety of ways. On the theoretical level, computer systems and other media that handle personal information are capable of inflicting harm on the data subject in two principal ways: (1) by disseminating evidence of present or past actions or associations to a wider audience than the subject consented to or anticipated when he originally surrendered the information (deprivation of access control), and (2) by introducing factual or contextual inaccuracies that create an erroneous impres- sion of the subject's actual conduct or achievements in the minds of those to whom the information is exposed (deprivation of ac- curacy control).67 Traditionally, the law has attempted to remedy these two wrongs separately by dealing with them under the re- spective theories of invasion of privacy and defamation,68 although the line between the two torts often proves to be extremely nebu- lous. Inasmuch as today's computer technology is the progenitor of a new communications medium, it seems desirable to determine the character and extent of the damage that can be inflicted on individual privacy by various aspects of data-processing. This should facilitate consideration of the possibility that the existing legal pattern is not sufficiently responsive to the challenges presented by the technology and requires modification or replacement by a new format. 1. Deprivation of A ccess Control The most significant computer-privacy problem is caused by the vulnerability of machine components and software to accident or intrusion.

In this condition the records are exposed to the danger of theft a possibility that is enhanced by the extreme compactness and con- centration of computerized records. Similarly, machine-readable records can be duplicated more rapidly and with less effort than their paper counterparts, usually without leaving any trace of tamper- ing.70 When information is moved from the files into the central pro- cessor of a time-sharing system, a number of additional dangers arise. Despite their image of infallibility, computers are so intricate and delicate that occasionally they can be rendered inoperative by a speck of dust.71 As a result, a minor mechanical failure may cause random distortion of data72 or direct a message to the wrong terminal on a remote-access system.73 Furthermore, the computer's rapid 69.

Another aspect of the vulnerability of computerized records is that they are easier to destroy than paper files. A simple magnet or a match can erase the enormous quan- tities of information stored on a reel of magnetic tape.

Indeed, the key software item of a time-share system the monitor or control program seems to be particularly vulnerable to pur- poseful intrusion. For example, there have been several reports that students have been successful in penetrating the protective features of university computers.75 Once the access code of the control program of the particular computer system is broken, the intruder has the ability to display and manipulate the data stored within the system.

In transmitting data, redundancy is the only remedy for faulty transmission. A single wrong bit, when detected, must either be corrected or retransmitted. To some extent, data may be corrected by error correcting codes which require built- in redundancy of the data transmitted. In most other instances erroneously re- ceived data must be retransmitted. 74.

ELECTRONICS, Jan. 9, 1967, at 25: The home of time-sharing, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been having trouble with students who break the elaborate codes that are supposed to insure the privacy of the users of its Project MAC (machine-aided cognition) computers. On one occasion, it's been reported, students tapped into lines carrying Government data, including information from the Strategic Air Command at Omaha. Some of this tinkering has had the effect of jamming the lines. Cf. Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 84 (testimony of the author): Computer experts at the Unilrersity of Michigan . . . tell me that a programmer with less than a month's training, can break the more elaborate encoding proce- dures currently being used in large data banks within 5 hours....

The programmer, for instance, could insert a secret "door" in the monitor program that would en- able unauthorized people to bypass protective devices, or "could 'bug' a machine in such a sophisticated manner that it might remain unnoticed for an extensive period."76 More simply, the computer's operator, or even a maintenance man, might reveal the nature of protective devices to snoopers or provide them with access keys. It also has been suggested that a corrupt repairman could "re-wire the machine so that certain instructions appeared to behave normally, whereas in fact, the protective mechanisms could be bypassed."77 When computerized information moves from the central pro- cessor through the communications links, the familiar specter of wiretapping is present. In addition to the relatively unsophisticated process of bugging the transmission line and recording or siphoning off the digital communications, the ingenious wiretapper with ad- vanced equipment could attach a terminal to the line and join the group sharing the computer's services. This could be done in several ways: by using a previously planted "door" in the control program; by intercepting a user's communication and substituting his own; by invading the system while a remote-access user has his channel open but is not transmitting; or by intercepting and cancelling a user's sign-off signal in order to continue operating the system under that user's name.78 The next two stages of the data-processing system-the switching center and the remote console- also are vulnerable to attempts to eavesdrop on electromagnetic radiations. In addition, the switch- ing center, either by mistake or as a result of tampering, may make a wrong connection and direct data to an unauthorized recipient. Finally, even when codes are used to protect the security of the remote-access terminals, an unauthorized user may "crack" the code or forge the required identification, or a malevolent authorized user may employ his console to alter the protective programs, "revise" the stored data, or misuse a printout of stored information that he obtained by a legitimate exercise of his access rights. The simplest of these techniques-forging access codes and mak- ing unauthorized copies of storage media such as tape-seem to have been successfully employed already.79 Although some of the 76.

The science fiction mystique surrounding cybernetics has a tendency to create a false sense of inviolability and impregnability, even among those on intimate terms with the machines. For example, one knowledgeable individual has argued that computerizing per- sonal information will offer greater protection for privacy than does yesterday's manila folder because the putative snooper will need "a machine, a codebook, a set of instructions, and a technician" in order to gain access to the data and translate it into comprehensible notation.80 It is doubtful that this is an accurate summary of con- ditions even in the present state of the eavesdropper's art. Indeed, other experts have flatly asserted that most program languages are easy to decipher,8l that digital transmission of data "does not provide any more privacy than . . . Morse code,"82 and that "modest resources suffice to launch a low-level infiltration effort."83 Even assuming the high cost of making a successful penetration of the data, there are countervailing factors that negate the supposed gain in protection achieved by converting data into a machine- readable format. For one thing, the payoff for a successful intrusion may be higher than would be true if the records were kept in a more mundane style. The centralization of formerly decentralized stores of information that results from computerizing records often will mean that one invasion will secure for the intruder vast quantities of data that formerly could be obtained only by several file penetrations. In addition, the snooper who has access to a single remote terminal will be able to reach all of the relevant data in a computer network that may be composed of numerous information nodes geographically distributed across the continent or around the world. Finally, the computer-based record system of the future simply is likely to contain more extensive information than traditional files. For these reasons, the snooper's "cost per unit of dirt" actually may be lower for poach- ing computerized records than it is for paper files. Given the incentive of a potentially high payoff for invading com- puterized files or intercepting data transmissions, there is no 80.

And once they have that hardware and training, the police can be expected to apply it in contexts other than the simple interception of conversations being carried by digital transmission. 2. Deprivatzon of Accuracy Control To the vulnerability of machine components must be added numerous possibilities for human error in information-handling that are created or exacerbated by computer technology. The risk that careless or malicious administrators will introduce errors into records containing personal data is a familiar one, and its origins cannot be attributed to the advent of the computer. However, as computer capacity increases the range and volume of individualized data that is stored, this risk undoubtedly will be magnified. Indeed, until highly acctlrate mechanical input devices- such as optical scanners87 become operational, the likelihood of human error in the recording process necessarily is going to be higher than it is in the context of traditional record-keeping because of the extra handling stage that is necessary to translate raw data from alpha- betic notation into the appropriate computer input format. For these and other reasons, there is a widespread and legitimate fear of overcentralizing individualized information and then increas- ing the number of people who, by having access to it, have the capacity to inflict damage through negligence, sheer stupidity, or a lack of sensitivity to the value of personal privacy. Unthink- ing people are as capable of injuring others by unintentionally rendering a record inaccurate, losing it, or disseminating its con- tents to unauthorized users as are people acting out of malice or for personal aggrandizement. It simply is unrealistic to expect subtle 84. It has been suggested that outside intrusion into a computer system could serve as the basis of a "change your dossier for a fee" service, for example.

Information can be entirely accurate and sufficient in one context and wholly incomplete and misleading in another. As large numbers of remote terminals are linked to computers and as today's local and regional data centers are linked together in national or international net- works, information will be moved and stored far from its point of original recordation and employed for purposes and by people un- associated with its collectiononditions that, it has been suggested, virtually guarantee inaccurate human interpretation.89 Errors of this type can occur in a number of ways. Raw, unevaluated data about an individual can give rise to damaging inferences that a fuller explication, direct knowledge of the information's source, or a highly professional analysis would prevent. Illustrative of this type of distortion is a terse entry stating that the subject was arrested, convicted of a felony, and sentenced to a federal penitentiary for a certain number of years. The impact of this data on the individual's ability to obtain employment or credit surely will be detrimental. Yet the "felon" may have been a conscientious objector who could not meet the requirements for exemption from military service that existed at the time he was to be inducted. If the events occurred in the distant past and the legal or social attitude toward the par- ticular "offense" has moderated, the entry is doubly dangerous.90 Other difficulties are likely to increase the risk of inaccurate in- terpretation in subtle ways. What appears to be "hard," "factual" data often takes on different shades of meaning in different con- texts, and the individual who is asked to provide a simple item of information for one purpose may omit explanatory details that be- come crucial when his file is surveyed for unrelated purposes. An unexplicated notation of an individual's marital status conveys differ- ent connotations to the Selective Service System, a credit bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Social Security Administra- tion. Similarly, many information gatherers fail to appreciate the 88. See generally Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 75-76 (statement of the author). 89.

These sheets are supposed to include in- formation on the court disposition following each arrest, but in the past this data has not been furnished in thirty-five per cent of the cases.92 The computer's image of infallibility often leads people to accept its output unthinkingly. This is unfortunate. To paraphrase a remark by Senator Fulbright in the course of his debate with Secretary of Defense Laird over the ABM: Just because data is stored in a com- puter doesn't make it accurate.93 But this belief does exist, and it may accentuate a problem that always has inhered in the compilation of personal information-the danger of relying on "soft" or sub- jective data for human evaluations or decision-making. Psychological tests can be designed for machine scoring, and the results, either in raw form or after evaluation, can be added to the individual's dossier. Despite the apparently authoritative character of such tests, a subh stantial number of people in the scientific community question theiJ ability to reflect accurately the complexities of an individual's be liefs and attitudes.94 Thus, their presence in a computer fiIe, eithel as raw test responses or in the form of an evaluation, can be ex- tremely dangerous to the subject unless the test data is accompanied by an extensive explanation of the conditions under which the test was administered and the purpose for which it was taken. Since the cost of preparing and storing such a lengthy caveat would be high, there is considerable likelihood that it will not be included. Similarly, efficiency ratings for employees and students are valu- able and have a long history of use, but there is a possibility that computerization will render them less reliable. For one thing, factors 91. Even if these information managers wanted to ameliorate pieces of data with supplementing information, there are a number of reasons why they might be unable to do so. First, their system may not be designed to accommodate such data. Second, since many large data banks may have many uses, the managers may have no idea when a piece of information is fed into the system whether or not amelioration will later be necessary. Furthermore, they may not be able to tell exactly what will ameliorate an entry, since they do not know all of the purposes for which the entry will be used. 92.

Exchange of evaluative information among differ- ent organizations that lack common traditions of scoring or inter- preting performance can compound the confusion, since a "fair" rating may denote average performance in one setting and very poor work in another.95 The problem of sharing information based upon noncomparable categories or premises is not insubstantial.96 Data gatherers alsrays have exhibited a marked propensity to cooperate with each other in exchanging information,97 and there is no reason to expect that the practice will decline as machine interfaces for the transfer of data become easier to establish. This ease of information movement, coupled with the technology's aura of omniscience, may motivate some administrators to rely on soft data without a reason- able investigation as to its source, the purpose for which it originally was collected, or the evaluation standards of the data originator. Thus, success or failure in life ultimately may turn on what other people decide to put in an individual's file and the programmer's ability, or inability, to evaluate, process, and interrelate informa- tion. These prospects are made even more depressing by the realiza- tion that the great bulk of the data likely to find its way into the 95. Professor Karst, supra note 67, at 356, points out that the danger of personal evaluation "lies in the fact that the evaluator and the recipient of his information may not share the same standards for reducing a complex set of facts to evaluative inferences or even the same language." The example given is the military officer's effectiveness- rating system, in which an apparently average rating really connotes low quality performance. See also Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 75-76 (statement of the author). 96. The difficulties caused by incompatible categories are one of the chief impedi- ments to creation of a uniform federal statistical system. See, e.g., SUBCOMMIrrEE ON ECONOMIC STATISTICS OF THE JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE, THE COORDINATION AND INTEGR&amp;TION OF GOVERNMENT STATISTICAL PROGRAMS, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (196T): In general, the bodies of data [collected by federal agencies] do not mesh ac- cording to any overall system and there is much inflexibility which often prevents fitting the micro data to behavioral models. Reasons for the incompatibility in- clude the following: (1) differing definitions, classifications, and timing of respondent reports when uniformity is needed; . . - (3) differing qualities of data and inconsistent documentation. The difficulties in obtaining comparable statistics even when the categories are uniform are discussed in Hearings on Statistical Programs 12: We have such things as a Standard Industrial Classified Code or codes which are in effect and utilized by different agencies.... The descriptive phrases which are used to label these collection boxes are supposed to be standard for the different agencies, but there are some practical problems.... It is possible for one agency or one statistical program to wind up with a box with the same standard classi- fication label as another, but each containing a different collection of respondents. . . . Agencies may occasionally establish different cutoff Ipoints that determine which box will actually receive a given respondent unit. See also id. at 116. 97.

Furthermore, a computerized file has a certain indelible quality- adversities cannot be overcome with time absent an electronic eraser and a com- passionate soul willing to use it. The computer's demonstrated ability to assemble and collate large quantities of information relevant to a given subject also may lead to an abdication of human responsibility for making important judgments or debilitate the willingness of decision makers to return to the original information source to seek out more or better data. Although it often is stated that the computer's utility necessarily is limited by the quality of the input-hence the maxim "garbage in, garbage out" (GIGO) the hypnotic effect of being able to manipu- late enormous data bases with the press of the proverbial button makes it questionable whether human evaluations always will pro- vide a final check on the application of the computer's output. By using the computer to quantify intangible elements or by asking it the wrong questions, an administrator can produce plausible answers that, when acted upon, might precipitate disaster.98 Some notion of the problems that may arise in the handling of personal data as an assist in policy-making can be divined from a report of one controversial computer application: [In New York a] . . . computer that had been fed accumulated information from bettors, police and other sources spewed out the names of eighty-six alleged bookmakers. Indictments followed. The machine had not only stored the information but had evaluated it. The government claimed that the three-year statute of limitations on the charges might have expired before human investigators could have evaluated the data.99 A number of disturbing questions are raised by this brief account. Although programming a computer to select names of people for indictment may fall within the prosecutor's discretion, are there any constraints on the procedures employed? Must they meet some minimal standard of computer science? More important, who deter- mines what raw data has sufficient probative value to warrant being fed into the computer and what weight is to be assigned to particular items within each category of information? Will the official who is invested with authority to decide whether an indictment should be sought on the basis of the computer output 98. Cf. E.

The possible prejudice to the individual resulting from the practice is not likely to end with the decision to seek an indictment. Com- menting on this particular computer application, a lawyer observed: "[T]he . . . computer can tell you where the stars are going to be a million years from now.

Cybernetics As an Instrument of SurzJeillance Perhaps the most serious apprehensions concerning the implica- tions of the computer for personal privacy are warranted when con- sidering the use of the new technology in concert with surveillance activities. One rather obvious application of this type that is alluded to throughout this Article is the development of a "record prison" from the computer's prodigious storage capacity. The ability of a sophisticated data center to generate a comprehensive womb-to- tomb dossier on an individual and transmit it over a national net- work is one of the most graphic threats of the computer revolu- tion.lol Another possible application of the new technology stems from the capacity to manipulate a highly detailed data base in order to simulate the behavior of a complex organization. If a corpora- tion has enough information about one of its competitors, for example, it may be able to predict the rival's future actions, a useful resource in the context of contract bidding. But beyond these relatively benign applications, it also seems feasible to employ computer analysis to determine what types of false stimuli or corporate feints are likely to cause a desired response on the part of the competitor.102 It does not require a vivid imagination to conjure up a number of simulation activities involving human manipulation if extensive enough dossiers are available. In addition to using the computer to construct and manipulate personal files, however, it also is possible to use the machine in conjunction with seemingly unrelated data files to analyze an in- 100.

This capacity for "inferential relational retrieval''103 is demonstrated by the following description of Ameri- can Airlines' seemingly innocuous flight reservation computer: American's computer can be queried about any traveler's move- ment in the past two or three months. In a furious burst of speed, the electric typewriter spews out a dossier; flights traveled, seat number, time of day, telephone contact, hotel reservation, car reser- vation, fellow travelers, etc. . . . [A] computer expert for the airline says that 10 to 15 investi- gators a day (Federal, state, local and other) are permitted to delve into the computer for such information. Some of them want (and get) a print-out of the entire passenger list of a certain Night to see who might be traveling with a particular person.104 A further significant threat to personal freedom is presented by the inevitable linking of computers to existing surveillance devices for monitoring people and their communications. One of the simplest of the present generation of snooping devices is the pen register, which, when attached to a telephone line, records on paper a series of dashes representing all numbers dialed from the selected tele- phone.105 But this snooping capability would be increased by several orders of magnitude if a few pen registers were attached to suspects' telephone lines and the information drawn in by these devices fed into a central computer. This technique could quickly provide a revealing analysis of patterns of acquaintances and dealings among a substantial group of people. Indeed this may be possible without pen registers; when the telephone companies' move to digital trans- mission is complete, a by-product may be a ready-made data base on past communications that awaits only cross-correlation. Yet, the computer-pen register combination is relatively prim- itive and its surveillance yield is relatively low compared to the forecasted marriage between computers and the emerging optical scanner technology.

By computerizing the data drawn in by the scanners and subjecting it to a sophis- ticated control program, this type of surveillance could yield ex- haustive lists of the mail sent and received by thousands of in- dividuals and organizations. There are many other possible applications for scanners. For example, computers presently are being used to help trap scoff- laws in a number of jurisdictions. The most common of the current procedures calls for police officers at a checkpoint to radio the license plate numbers of passing cars to a computer operator. The operator then inputs the number, the computer responds by pro- viding a printout revealing whether any violations are outstand- ing against that license number or the person in whose name the car is registered, and the operator informs the officers of the re- sults.l08 Optical scanners designed to decipher license numerals 106.

The Post Office Department's mail cover procedure was described as follows by the Chief Postal Inspector in Hearings on Invasions of Privacy (Government Agen- cies) Before the Subcomm. on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 67 (1965): A nlail cover simply consists of recording from a piece of mail the name and address of the sender, the place and date of postmarking, and the class of mail. Mail is neither delayed nor opened.... Only the material appearing openly on the wrapper is noted. The recording is done by a postal employee. A mail cover is authorized only when there is good reason to believe that it may be instrumental in the solution of a crime. Information obtained from a cover is used as leads in an investigation, not as evidence in court. The legality of mail cover operations has been upheld in United States v.

Assum- ing an improved state of the art, these devices might be capable of transmitting data relating to physiological and chemical changes resulting from various bodily processes to a computer that is pro- grammed to monitor and record the data, transmit a response to the sensor, or sound an alarm when specified chemical or biological events occur. To be sure, monitoring systems of this type are adapt- able to many beneficial and humanitarian purposes, such as allow- ing a patient under treatment to resume his normal activities wear- ing sensing devices that will warn his doctor instantaneously when physiological changes symptomatic of impending danger appear.l09 But telemetry also can be imposed on a so-called "antisocial" or "aberrational" individual in order to reveal whether or not the concentration of personality-altering chemicals in his bloodstream is at a "stable" level,ll° or to administer rewards and punishments oS the highway is being developed within the Department of Transportation.

The Psychological Aspects of a Dossier Society Since the right to privacy has been conceived in part to assure the individual's emotional integrity,ll3 it is appropriate to consider currently saving the State of New York, alone, some $30-million a year, according to a report from the office of Dr. Alan D. Miller, Commissioner of Mental Hy- giene. . ., [T]hanks largely to drug therapy, releases from the state's hospitals have soared from 10,394 a year in 1955 to 32,625 in 1968. Across the nation, in other states which invest more cash per capita in the care of mental illness . . . the results have been even more dramatic, with caseloads declining as much as 25 per cent. See also Michael, Speculation on the Relation of the Computer to Individual Freedom and the Right to Privacy, 33 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 270, 281 (1964). The actual use of these techniques is described in Berry, Project Brain Control, reprinted in 111 CONG. REC. 16,181, 16,182 UU1Y 9, 1965): ESB [electrical stimulation of the brain] has . . . been used experimentally to treat mental patients. At Tulane University . . . a select group of chronic mental cases were equipped with self-stimulators. Buttons on a special belt activated electrodes in their brains. Whenever a patient felt depressed, he pushed the but- ton. ESB, washing away anxiety, helped restore a more cheerful mood. In cases where patients had severe psychotic seizures, ESB turned uncontrollable rage into euphoria. 111. Note, Anthropotelemetry: Dr. Schwitzgebel's Machine, 80 HARV. L. REV. 403, 407 (1966): If criminality is acquired, like other behavior, by imitation and social condi- tioning, it should be possible to remove it by conditioning more acceptable con- duct. Tracking is a useful tool for such conditioning: it indicates when the act to be rewarded takes place, and it enables the reward to be given immediately, which is vital. Two effective rewards, [verbal] approval and electrical stimulation of the brain, are easy to administer through a tracking system. See also Miller, On Proposals and Requirements for Solutions, in Symposium- Com- puters, Data Banks, and Individual Privacy, 53 MINN. L. REV. 211, 226-27 (1968). These concepts seem likely to gain increasing approval in medical and scientific circles. See, e.g., McConnell, Psychoanalysis Must Go, ESQUIRE, Oct. 1968, at 176, 280: Maybe "mental illness" is a myth maybe what's wrong with most patients is that they've learned bad or "sick" behavior patterns. And if they've learned those be- haviors, they can be induced to unlearn them if we go about things in the right way. To phrase it another way, perhaps the trouble with crazy people is that they act crazy. Not that they are crazy, but that they act crazy. You and I act sane be- cause we've been rewarded for acting sane, and punished severely if our behavior gets too far out of line. If we want to cure "sick" behavior, perhaps we can do so by rewarding patients for acting sane, or by punishing them for acting insane, or both. This very simple, intriguing idea is rapidly turning psychology and psy- chiatry upside down. 112. Some of the limitations on total surveillance are pointed out in V.

In view of the computer's ability to pre- serve and retrieve vast quantities of minute personal data and assist irl the administration of socially desirable welfare and environ- mental programs, it might seem anomalous that one of the chief apprehensions concerning the computer age is that it brings with it the threat of depersonalization.l14 Upon reflection, this incongru- ity unfortunately proves to be only superficial. As the populace be- comes increasingly aware that a substantial number of personal facts are being preserved on "the record," people may start to doubt whether they have any meaningful existence apart from the pro- file in the computer's files.ll5 As a result, they may begin to base their personal decisions, at least in part, on whether it will enhance their record image in the eyes of third parties who have control over important aspects of their lives: The terms consequential behavior and acting for the record . . . [may be] used interchangeably. They involve not only the control of forethought to our behavior, but also mean that one should act so that things must appear on the record in a limited way. One puts to oneself not only the admonition that "I had better be care- 114. Representative Corneilius E. Gallagher stated his view in House Hearings on the Computer and Invasion of Privacy 2: "The Computerized Man," as I see him, would be stripped of his individuality and privacy. Through the standardization ushered in by technological advance, his status in society would be measured by the computer, and he would lose his personal identity. His life, his talent and his earning capacity would be reduced to a tape with very few alternatives available. This complaint is not unique to the computer age. It was a common objection to the industrial revolution and the so-called mass society and mass culture. See generally V. FERKISS, supra note 112, at 60-76. 115. Michael, supra note 110, at 277: As the society grows more complex and the individual's sense of his ability to influence it in his own interest seems smaller, the tendency to deperld for place- ment and advancement on what can be revealed about oneself which can be evi- denced and acted on "scientifically" may well increase.... This response also will be a natural extension of our dependency on the machine, which in this case will help the expert or make the decisions itself about the value of the individual, impersonally but with great precision .... In fact, there may be a very real sense in which a person does not exist outside of his computer dossier. Consider the following colloquy taken from House Hearings on the Computer and Invasion of Privacy 145: MR. GALLAGHER.... Since the IRS has now set up a central data collection service and now that we have the potential of erasing from the computer's memory and truly making a person an "unperson," would it be possible for a skilled com- puter expert to make himself a nontaxpayer, by programming himself out of existence? MR. SQUIRES. That is a very interesting question. I suspect that it would be. MR. GALLAGHER. Therefore, by sending in the wrong card or the right card, or the wrong answers, he could be eliminated from existence from the rolls of the IRS. MR. SQUIRES.

Thus, the technical demand for more personal information to be recorded and a conscious public concerned with keeping the record straight lie at the root of the new invasion of privacy. It is a depriva- tion of privacy that cannot be legislated against nor moralized against. It is a source of social control which necessitates new tech- niques and a pervading inquiry into our social, economic, and political actions and our motivations for them. It is an invasion which most people willingly accept, since they have not known other conditions and are happy to be publicly significant to someone.1l6 This psychology may be augmented by the conception of the computer as the unforgetting and unforgiving watchdog of the in- formation managers. As one observer has remarked, "the possibility of the fresh start is becoming increasingly difficult. The Christian notion of redemption is incomprehensible to the computer.''1l7 It thus is not surprising that there appears to be a reaction against computerized decision-making and other appearances of human abdication to the machine. Increasingly, the computer is becoming a convenient scapegoat for a number of man's ills; there is evidence that the frustrations generated by the computerized environment are provoking highly irrational responses on the part of disenchanted groups. People have written letters to computers operated by commercial dating services, commenting on the dates that have been arranged for them;ll8 naked protesters have pick- eted IBM offices with signs stating that "Computers are Ob- scene'';1l9 and computer operators reportedly have ascribed human personalities to their machines.120 Personification of computers has carried over into the arts: computers have emerged from the world 116.

Nevertheless, the breadth of concern over the dehumanization of modern society and the animus directed at the computer cannot be ignored. The omnipresence of the computer cannot help but have a numbing effect on the congeries of values we subsume under the heading "personal privacy." Generations of children reared in an environment of terminals, punchcards, and computer assisted instruction cannot help but have a set of attitudes and values differ- ent from those of the present population, unless some effort is made to infiltrate the curriculum of the future with at least a minimal level of privacy indoctrination.l30 As Richard L.

BALANCING THE EFFICIENCY INTEREST It should now be apparent that it is necessary to undertake a thorough examination of the vehicles that the advocates of efficiency and economy have used to bring about the present trends in com- puter use. We also must probe the legitimacy of their objectives, and ultimately decide how best to achieve some equilibrium be- tween these forces and the desiderata of personal privacy. In this section of the Article, two applications of information technology one from the public sector and one from the private sector will be dissected in the hope of shedding some light on the nature of the conflicting considerations. The proposal for a National Data Center and the activities of private credit bureaus were selected be- underestimated. If we wish to preserve even modified democratic values in a multi- billion-person-society, then the computer, mass data processing, and communica- tions are absolute necessities.... The computer and modern data processing provide the refinement the means to treat individuals as individuals rather than as parts of a large aggregate. The treatment of an individual as an individual will not be an unmixed bless- ing. Problems concerning the protection of privacy will be large.

A. The National Data Center The federal government long has been the nation's primary user of data-processing equipment; in fact, it was a government agency- the Bureau of the Census that purchased the first commercial com- puter nearly two decades ago.l32 Reliance on data-processing was a natural response to the proliferation of citizen reports and data collection activities that are the inevitable by-product of expansive federal programs in health, social security, employment, taxation, and education. Administration of the social security and income tax programs alone necessitates more than 600 million annual reports.l33 Moreover, as noted earlier,l34 federal programs generate statistics that are becoming increasingly crucial as a foundation for sound social and economic research and policy-making. But these reports and statistics in turn beget additional reports and statistics, and the over-all effect is a seemingly unremitting stream of data engi- neered by some diabolical Sorcerer's Apprentice. Computerized statistical and information systems have a vital role when the government commits itself to the solution of problems requiring analysis and correlation of a large number of factors. In these contexts, the computer's ability to manipulate vast bodies of detailed information permits the testing of hypotheses by using a greater mass of data concerning a larger number of potentially relevant variables encompassing longer periods of time than has hitherto been feasible.l35 As federal agency functions currently are arranged, however, only one government bureau, Census, has the collection and analysis 132.

Moreover, effective information practices are prevented because some agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission, must operate under relatively stringent confidentiality require- ments that preclude the general release of data.l36 A decentralized system also creates obstacles to the user of statistics; some govern- ment data is classified, and available collections of data often are almost impossible to locate, are arranged inconveniently for access and analytical purposes, or are difficult to compare because of differ- ences in agency procedures.l37 With the possible exception of the Committee on Scientific and Technical Information (COSATI) of the Federal Council of Science and Technology,l38 there is no single government organization that can provide a reference guide to the kinds and locations of information being collected. COSATI also seems to be the only body that is directly concerned with the quality of the Government's information activities, despite the fact that the Government expends over one billion dollars annually in * * * * f n ormatlon actlvltles. These deficiencies in the federal government's information activities have several deleterious side-effects. First, the duplication of effort and time wasted in locating data and translating it into a form that is functional for second and subsequent users means a reduction in the over-all efficiency of governmental operations and an increase in its cost. Second, duplication in information collection often means an unnecessarily high and repetitious reporting burden on individuals and institutions.l39 Third, large quantities of useful 136.

There is a significant store of data hidden away in the interstices of the governmental structure that could be utilized profitably in endeavors such as the quest for consumer protection; government information pools of this sort and nongovernmental data bases of comparable character -should be made readily available to those people who are partic- ularly vulnerable to or concerned about various social problems. All things considered, therefore, it was eminently logical for the Bureau of the Budget to take a moderate step toward reform by proposing the creation of a single federal statistical center that would relieve the operating agencies of the task of generating statistics and cen- tralize the existing diffused bodies of data in one location.l40 But the data center proposal became a lightning rod for the vague feelings of discontent and apprehension generated by the computer revolution. First Congress,l4l then the newspapersl42 and magazines,l43 and finally the law reviewsl44 took turns castigating the idea, often in emotive or highly symbolic terms. To a degree, the clamor was most fortunate; the original proposals were in- credibly myopic in their obsession with efliciency. For example, none of the three reports recommending establishment of a federal data bank gave the problem of privacy more than token attention and despite early protestations to the contrary, proponents of the data center later admitted that individual identification would have to be linked to data deposited in the centerl46-an admission that has enormous implications for individual privacy. One of the chief advocates of the center subsequently characterized this failure to 140. The proposal to create a federal data center was advanced in a series of three reports: Report of the Committee on the Preservation and Use of Economic Data to the Social Science Research Council (April 1965) (Ruggles Report), reprinted in House Hearings on the Computer and Invasion of Privacy 195-254; Statistical Evaluation Report No. 6-Review of Proposal for a National Data Center (Dunn Report), re- printed in House Hearings on the Computer and Invasion of Privacy 254-94; Report of the Task Force on the Storage of and Access to Government Statistics (Kaysen Report), reprinted in Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 25-37. 141.

The proposals envisioned only a statistical center and they xvere limited in scope; thus, if the potential for expansion and individualization of the center's files is put to one side, reasonable men might view the threat to individual privacy as a relatively remote one. Moreover, until the contours of the center were more sharply delineated, the forms in which invasions of privacy might occur w-ould remain obscure, making it difficult to formulate precise proposals for protection. In the course of the congressional debate it became clear that the decentralized nature of the federal reporting system, which the statisticiarls and social scientists derisively characterized as ineffi cient, serves as one of the basic safeguards against the compilation of extensive government dossiers on each citizen.l47 Indeed, its maligned inefficiency virtually assures that. And, although propo- nents of the data center were astute to point out the excellent record of protecting sensitive information compiled by some federal agen- cies, most notably the Census Bureau, the dialogue also revealed that several federal agencies and bureaus had a less enviable past history in the privacy arena.l48 NIoreover, it became apparent that the bodies of information that ultimately would find their way into the proposed data bank would be "orders of magnitude more sensitive than those now at the Bureau of the Census,''l49 with each failure of security likely to be "many times more destructive to an individual.''l50 Chastened by the public outcry, the statisti- cians and administrators retreated to reconsider their proposal and to investigate the safeguards that would be necessary to render a National Data Center more palatable.l5l 146.

Information collections prepared for statistical purposes, which bore the brunt of the outcry during the data center controversy, comprise only about one fifth to one third of the reports extracted from citizens.l52 Thus, the public de- bate never really reached the question of preserving the integrity of the bulk of the sensitive data held by the government and the problem of regulating the government's penchant for increased in- formation collection. Moreover, purely statistical studies generally do not contain sensitive data of the type that is attractive to snoop- ers; therefore, they are somewhat easier to protect against intrusion than investigative files, although the claimed distinction between statistical systems and surveillance systems153 does not appear to be particularly valid.l54 Ironically, the failure to establish a data center under a legis- lative mandate to take the steps necessary to protect individual privacy may undermine individual privacy if nothing is done to curb the present tendency of each federal agency to "constitute itself a data center.''l55 The legal authority for this pattern al- ready exists. The Administrator of the General Services Admin- istration (GSA), for example, has statutory power to establish inter- agency pools of data-processing equipment and facilities,l56 and the And without a carefully developed plan the Administration has no intention of creating a Data Center.

The prospect of an omnibus, de facto federal data center evolving without prior comprehensive congressional review or any defined obligation to protect privacy is not a happy one in view of past revelations about some government information-handling prac- tices. Perhaps most disheartening is the fact that the existing con- trols on the type and volume of information that may be exacted from the public seem to have been largely ineffectual. The Fed- eral Reports Act164 provides that federal agencies must obtain clear- ance from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget before col- lecting data from ten or more persons. Clearance is rarely denied;l65 indeed, the Budget Bureau has been known to act as an advocate as well as a judge, intervening in Congress to obtain support for cer- tain information-gathering projects.166 Even this highly permissive procedure is thought to be unduly burdensome by some agencies, however, and on occasion they have circumvented the Federal Reports Act by failing to obtain clearance for data-gathering done for them by independent contractors.167 Agencies also may evade the clearance requirements by securing bodies of data from fed- erally financed state agencies under the threat of withholding funds,l68 or by claiming exemptions from the requirements of the Act.169 Moreover, Congress' ultimate power over appropriations, which was advanced as a practical control mechanism on the nature of the information that might be stored in the proposed federal data center,170 hardly seems capable of remedying deficiencies in the 164. 5 u.s.c. § 139 (1964). 165.

Appropriation levels generally are determined on the basis of an over-all view of agency programs without any significant consideration of the reporting requirements that may be involved. In any event, appropriations committees usually are more concerned with agency personnel re- quests than with the minutiae of proposed programs.l7l The limited attention Congress gives to agency information practices should rsot be surprising in light of the fact that top-level administrators often are unaware of the amount and kinds of information that their own agency demands from the public.l72 Another fact of federal agency life that argues against allowing interagency computerized information pools to grow without super- vision is that governmental data gatherers may abuse their statutory data collection powers. A recent survey by a congressional subcom- mittee revealed many instances of excesses and concluded that "the majority of government forms require either nonessential or too de- tailed information from the individual citizen.''l73 In addition, agency information collectors may deceive the public into believing that they are required by law to respond to reports that in fact are voluntary; "in their zeal to increase the coverage and accuracy of a survey," one report concluded, "administrators have been known to use deceptive language in the wording of their questionnaires" to coerce responses.l74 171.

The FBI will probably be able to secure for him information from banks, stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other institutions which would not make available their records to the private investigator. . . . The guess may be ventured that in the overwhelming number of cases mere display of FBI credentials is a guarantee of rather full disclosure of all information sought.

The information that is exacted, whether procured legally or not, often is taken without any assur- ance that it will be handled on a confidential basis; if the agency does make a pledge, it is a virtually meaningless one not to release the information outside of the government.l75 It is highly unreal- istic to expect the donor of the data to have any accurate conception of the uses to which it will be put or the potential audience to which it will be exposed. Even if confidentiality restrictions control a particular agency's activities, they are likely to reflect little more than ad hoc judgments rather than a carefully developed statutory or regulatory system for protecting citizen privacy.l76 Those safe- guards that do exist often are vitiated by the propensity of bureau- crats to cooperate with each other in exchanging information of the most sensitive nature.l77 The reports of past excesses would be understandable, perhaps pardonable, if they had resulted solely from efforts to obtain data that is essential to the solution of pressing social problems. Often, however, this has not been the case. As a congressional subcom- mittee revealed, "a number of surveys are conducted at the request (and often at the expense) of industry groups, trade associations, and often business organizations.''l78 Big business easily can absorb the cost of replying to myriad governmental questionnaires, and can hire the analysts and marketing experts necessary to make prof- itable use of government statistics.l79 On the other hand, the burden on small businessmen is a heavy one and they receive little or no 175.

As might be expected, this argument was advanced by the advocates of the National Data Center.l8l Of course, past abuses are not a justification for abolishing or drastically reducing the government's statistical or information activities. As stated above, extensive gathering and analysis of information is essential to the functioning of a highly complex society. However, past history does afford ample reason to be skep- tical of demands for more information and facile assertions that the establishment of computerized government data centers will in- crease the protection given to individual records. The claim that these centers will make it easy and desirable to purge stale records because computer storage costs are relatively high no doubt has validity;182 it becomes less persuasive, however, when considered in light of congressional findings that the mounting cost of storing paper records already is necessitating the destruction of stale data,183 and that "computer technology shares the responsibility for increas- ing Federal reporting requirements.''184 This is consistent with the notion advanced earlier185 that the very expansion of data-handling capacity tends to encourage an expanded appetite for information.

Unlike old-fashioned paper files, where storage is very cheap but removal of data is very expensive, in the case of the computer file, storage is very expensive and selective removal is very cheap....

But the episode also confronts us with an interesting dilemma. If defeat of the National Data Center simply encourages the proliferation of unregulated intra-agency data centers and machine interfaces among the various agencies, then the cure may be more dangerous than the disease. The more attractive alternative appears to be a data center that is functionally circumscribed and is structured to place a heavy premium on privacy considerations. Prior to estab- lishing such a center, the government's information policies must be comprehensively evaluated in the hope of achieving an over-all balance between the need for massive amounts of raw data that can be handled efficiently and used for a variety of purposes and the obligation of the national government to preserve the privacy of its citizens. Moreover, this evaluation must be a continuing one in order to keep pace with changing agency practices in the col- lection and use of data. B. The Computerized Credit Bureau The privacy implications of the increase in credit information services in the private sector have received almost as much attention in the recent past as has the proposal to establish a National Data Center. Buying on credit has become an integral part of daily life in the United States, and the number of credit consumers and the amount spent annually on credit purchases are steadily increasing.186 Along with the new pace of credit transactions, the urbanization and mobility of the population has made it necessary for most credit grantors to base their decisions on information gathered by credit bureaus rather than on personal knowledge of the borrower as was true in more halcyon days. The vast majority of people willingly (and often unthinkingly) supply lenders and credit bureaus with substantial quantities of per- sonal information in order to obtain the benefits of the credit econ- omy.l87 To augment this data, many credit bureaus also regularly comb newspapers, court records showing the institution of lawsuits, and other public files for bits of personal data that might be relevant to the decision about whether an individual is an acceptable credit 186. The growth of credit buying is documented in H. BLACK, BUY NOW, PAY LATER (1961). Each month approximately eight billion dollars worth of credit is extended in the United States.

These activities and the pool of information they create pose sub- stantial access and accuracy problems of the type discussed earlier.189 The credit-reporting industry's record of protecting personal privacy has been extremely spotty. Testimony presented to congres- sional subcommittees indicates that some of the practices of the re- tail credit-reporting associationsompanies that cater primarily to insurance companies and employers-are subject to sharp criti- cism.190 In addition to the activities described in the preceding para- graph, they engage in a fair amount of surveillance and rely on information gathered from third persons. As might be expected, these reports usually contain hearsay narratives gleaned from quick interviews with neighbors, landlords, employers, and "friends" con- ducted by poorly paid, relatively unsophisticated, and frequently insensitive functionaries.19l By way of defense, in many cases it prob- ably is true that the bureaus seek sensitive information only because their clients have requested it.192 And, it is probably true that they 188.

"Then you ask, 'What's your opinion of X's home life; how do you think of him as a family man?' This will usually elicit some hint.... Then you start digging.

Automobile insurance companies, on the other hand, emphasize other factors, among them the ages and abilities of the drivers, the uses and condition of an automobile, distance driven, prior accidents, and the history, if any, of driving under the influence of alcohol. Similarly, there are varying requirements for information in connection with other types of business transactions, such as property lines of insurance, prospective employment, claims investigations, and marketing information. 193.

Mangan, General Manager of the Credit Bureau of Greater Boston, Inc., Statement Before a Public Study Session of the Procedures and Practices of Credit Bureaus, Consumers' Council, Boston, Massachusetts, Oct. 15, 1968, at 7 (unpublished mimeo): We . . . copy from the local court houses filings of bankruptcies, divorces, attachments, and notices of supplementary process, which are a matter of public record, and we put this information into our files.... We have no difficulty picking up the filings of these matters because they are listed in the various records chronologically. We would like to pick up all dispo- sitions on the same general basis, but it is impossible to do so. Daily dispositions are not available in a chronological listing; they are posted back to the original filing and we have no way of knowing which book to go to, let alone which page. 194. For example, an actual bonding report prepared by the Retail Credit Com- pany was submitted to the House Subcotumittee on Invasion of Privacy in conjunction with the Hearings on Retail Cred it Company. The subject of the report, a retired army lieutenant colonel, was described as follows: He was known to be a rather wild tempered, unreasonable and uncouth person who abused his rank and wasn't considered a well adjusted person. He was known to roam the reservation at Ft. Hood and shoot cattle belonging to ranchers who had leased the grazing land from the Army. Reports of this kind may be very common, in light of the company practices de- scribed by Retail Credit's President: We check the former employer. We check possibly his school record to deter- mine what his record was in school if this is relevant to his particular employ- ment situation. We check to see if he has certain characteristics that might be advantageous for that particular job. If, for example, he is a sales prospect, is he a man with an outgoing person- ality? Does he get along well with people, has he shown leadership characteristics and this sort of thing. Then, of course, we try to see if he has had job difEculty, difficulty holding a job, or if for any reason he hasn't gotten along well with his previous employers.

The distinction between "credit-reporting agencies" such as the Retail Credit Company, and "credit bureaus" serving retail merchants, such as the ACB, is dis- cussed in House Hearings on Commercial Credit Bureaus 104-05. However, the dis- tinction is far from shaxp. For example, a wholly owned subsidiary of Retail Credit</page><page sequence="55">April 1969] Computers and Privacy 1143 vulnerable to objection.196 But there is evidence that the commercial credit bureaus have been remiss in terms of limiting access to their files. As part of a television news report,l97 CBS News staff members created a fictitious "systems" company, which requested financial information from twenty commercial credit bureaus in various parts of the country. The reports requested were on people chosen at random from the telephone directories in the locale of the selected bureaus. The CBS company's letter simply indicated that it was in- terested in extending credit to a particular person residing in the area covered by the bureau that was contacted. Despite the vigorous assertions by Mr. John Spafford, Executive Vice President of Asso- ciated Credit Bureaus of America (ACB), a nationwide organization of independent credit bureaus, that it was "impossible" to secure a report from an ACS member bureau unless the requesting party was a "bona fide creditor," the fictitious CBS company received, "without further question," full reports from ten of the bureaus.l98 The experiment was repeated following the adoption of new ACB "Credit Bureau Guidelines To Protect Consumer Privacy," which require the signing of a contract in which the client certifies that inquiries will be made only for credit-granting purposes.l99 To make it even more difficult, the CBS letter of request did not indicate that the information sought was to be used for credit-granting purposes; moreover, credit reports were sought on people who had complained to congressional investigators about their credit problems. Nonethe- less, seven out of twenty-eight of the selected bureaus provided the information without hesitation.200 In each sample group, some of the bureaus that did not comply with the initial request for a report stated in reply that they would Company controls sixty credit bureaus, Hearings on Retail Credit Company 4, while the ACB makes its files accessible to more than 1,400 collection agencies.

In one case the fictitious company did this, and the information was immediately forthcoming, despite the fact that an investigation by the bureau would have revealed that the request did not come from a bona fide credit grantor. As CBS commentator Mike Wallace remarked: "It would seem that signing a written con- tract is not much of a safeguard; all the client has to do is lie.''20l Even if the bureaus limit themselves to providing bona fide creditors with information about the financial history of consum- ers202 and refrain from supplying derogatory or innuendo-filled tid- bits,203 the problem of how to insure the accuracy of the financial reports that reach the credit grantor remains. At present credit bureau practices are virtually unregulated. A simple notation de- scribing the customer as "slow-pay," for example, can be extremely damaging, yet it may conceal an honest dispute in which the cus- tomer withheld payment in order to obtain the goods or services he bargained for in acceptable condition.204 Once an error of this type finds its way into a file, it may be virtually impossible to correct, or even to discover.205 One national organization, the Retail Credit 201. Id. 202. See, e.g., House Hearings on Commercial Credit Bureaus 110 (statement of John L.

On the contrary, the credit bureau, by providing factual information promptly and efEciently to credit grantors helps more people obtain more goods and services on credit. 203. See M. BRENTON, THE PRIVACY INVADERS 35 (1964), in which a credit bureau s manager is quoted as saying, "If everybody comes out white, the clients don't need us." It could be argued that a credit bureau which desires to maintain a reputation for accuracy will take measures to insure that its reports are truthful; but since the bureau's inaccuracy will be discovered only if credit is extended and the subject of the report subsequently defaults, it seems clear that the bureau's natural tendency would be to err on the side of supplying derogatory information. 204. See Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 81 (statement of the author). See also House Hearings on Commercial Credit Bureaus 11 (testimony of Professor Alan F. Westin): I think all of us, as buyers and consumers, appreciate that withholding payment is our most effective leverage in getting the performance of the contract as we believe it has been made.

How- ever, these smaller, local bureaus seem destined to disappear. The average credit bureau using a manual file system is likely to be a relatively inefficient operation that will prove increasingly incapable of storing, updating, retrieving, and transferring207 the information necessary to keep pace with the booming credit economy. Com- puter technology, mated with a high-speed transmission medium, is the ideal and inevitable method of improving the system. But this new equipment is expensive, and a trend toward large-scale credit information organizations already is evident. As early as September 1965, Credit Data Corporation inaugu- rated a large on-line computerized credit information system in California. In 1967 that company linked its Los Angeles and San Francisco offices to provide, in effect, a statewide computer credit network. During the same year, Credit Data opened a com- puterized center in New York City, and plans are underway for another center in Detroit.208 Credit Data responds to telephone in- quiries from subscribers by reading a printout of the computerized 206. Hearings on Retail Credit Company, appendix A: All reports, whether oral or written, will be kept strictly confidential: except as required by law, no information from reports nor your identity as the report- ing agency will be revealed to any other person except a person whose duty re- quires him to pass on the transaction in relation to which the report was ordered. W. Lee Burge, President of Retail Credit Company, sought to justify this clause by explaining that "it is a protection to the sources of information." Id. at 31. He also described the tortuous process that an individual would have to go through in order to track down an error in a Retail Credit Company Report: Let me reconstruct a typical conversation between a personnel manager and a person who has just been declined a job. He might say "Why don't I get the job," and [the personnel manager would reply], "Because in our investigation we have found that through some of your previous employers you embezzled funds," and on the strength of this information he says, "Well, who made the investigation?" And the personnel man says, "I am not at liberty to divulge this." On the basis of this, then, the man begins to ferret around to find out who is likely to make investigations of this sort. Of course, we come to the forefront under circumstances like this simply because of our prevalence in the business information field. Id. at 24-25. Obviously, the chances of an individual completing this process ex- peditiously are virtually nonexistent. See note 205 supra. 207. The importance of rapid retrieval and transmission is evident when it is realized that a computer system will enable data to be made available to a merchant quickly enough so that he can determine whether or not to grant credit before the customer leaves the premises or changes his mind about the purchase.

The response time averages two minutes.209 At present, Credit Data serves lenders in a geographic area con- taining over thirty-five million people. It has computerized credit information on over twenty million Americans and is adding new files on approximately 50,000 Americans each week.2l0 It is inter- esting to note that the company's original data base was secured by convincing a number of California banks to turn over their credit apparatus to them; Bank of America alone gave Credit Data eight million items.2ll It seems clear that Credit Data will continue to de- velop regional information nodes. It will then interconnect them by wire or microwave relay to establish a national credit information network. It also seems reasonable to forecast that large users of Credit Data's services will be provided with remote-access terminals permit- ting direct entry into the bureau's computerized files. This will greatly reduce the cost of having operators process individual tele- phone inquiries. Thus, a request for information at one point in the company's system would provide access to relevant data maintained at any other point in the network. ACB has been working on computerization since August 1965, when research began on a real-time2l2 computer system for member credit bureaus. The ACB system has been installed in Dallas and Houston, and another operation exists in Chicago. Currently there are more than 2,000 credit bureaus in this association, serving 365,- 000 credit grantors and maintaining files on approximately 100,- 000,000 Americans.2l3 In September 1968 ACB announced that it had signed an agree- ment with International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation to provide ACB members with computerized credit-reporting services. The new ACB-IT&amp;T system will offer local credit bureaus the option of computerizing their own operations without bearing the heavy financial burden of buying or leasing computer equipment and de- veloping their own data-processing systems and programs.2l4 At the 209.

However, given the resources of a company such as IT&amp;T, the raw data available in the files of the more than 2,000 members of ACB, and the seemingly inexorable march of com- puter technology in terms of increased speed and storage capacity, the consequences of the ACB-IT&amp;T operation seem obvious.2l5 Computerization of credit bureau files and the creation of na- tional networks conrlecting numerous data bases whose corltents will be available on a remote-access basis require concerted activity on the part of four previously independent industries: the computer manu- facturers, the credit bureaus, the communications carriers, and the credit grantors. Probably only a few large credit information com- panies command the necessary financial resources, data bases, and technical expertise to survive in this sophisticated national market. For example, it took the ACB nearly four years to develop a stan- dardized language of credit-reporting that would eliminate some of the softness in credit data and make machine processing easier.2l6 In addition, recent hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Monopoly and Antitrust revealed that firms in the other three in- dustries may extend their operations into the credit information market,2I7 and this may make it difficult for new firms to enter the field and may result in a potentially unhealthy level of business con- centration.2I8 If in fact only a small number of companies or networks survive as suppliers of credit information, vast stores of financial and per- sonal data will be centralized in the hands of relatively few people. This necessarily will result in the network managers having a con- siderable amount of economic power. In addition, a person's status in the community may be at the mercy of those who purport to have his financial history in their data bank.2l9 Another concern about nologies through the use of 'third-generation' computers, standard communications lines, and a variety of typewriter-like or visual display terminals."

This "improvement" in the data means that the bureaus will inevitably gather soft and sensi- tive information.220 In addition, given the massive investment re- quired to computerize a large credit data base and the technology's ability to manipulate bits of information in unique ways, the temp- tation to use the data for non-credit-grantirlg purposes will not be easy to resist. This is especially likely if the data base has been aug- mented by other information. A detailed account of a person's financial transactions, especially when accompanied by the type of investigative information collected by some of the credit bureaus, makes it easy to reconstruct his habits, associations, travel, and life style.22l If data of this type is compiled on a large group, it can be used for a number of noncredit commercial purposes, such as gen- erating a special mailing list contairling the names of consumers with certain characteristics who might be interested in a particular prod- uct,222 or rating the creditworthiness of a list of people who are likely prospects for a promotion campaign centered around the distribution of unsolicited credit cards.223 220.

But cf. the explanation offered by an ACB official in House Hearings on Com- mercial Credit Bureaus 133: Credit bureaus consider it a responsibiIity in the interest of good government to assist government investigations with information that may be helpful. Some of these agencies are interested in identifying information rather than credit information. If the bureau file shows a former address, a former employer, or other clue to pertinent history, the agency investigator uses the lead to continue his investigation. We believe that this substantially reduces the expenditure of time and money by the various agencies.

The possible abuses of a computerized credit information net- work are not the only aspects of the credit bureau of the future that deserve attention. The "watch service" offered by ACB members, for example, actually constitutes an unsophisticated form of sur- veillance. It involves monitoring the public records and an individ- ual's transactions after he has made a credit purchase, in order to inform the lender promptly if there is any indication that the cus- tomer will not be able to meet his obligation.231 Control over an individual's credit history also provides considerable leverage for collecting debts that otherwise might be written oS by the credit grantor. ACB supplies economic data to collection agencies as well as to credit grantors,232 and, in the course of "counselling" the consumer on his credit problems, bureaus and agencies that are members of ACB often are able to '&lt;convince'' individuals to "rehabilitate their credit by paying off delinquent accounts over ten years old."233 This practice reflects the enormous in terrorem eSect of a permanent credit bureau file and graphically demonstrates its ability to outlive the applicable statute of limitations. Finally, it has been suggested that the ownership of Welcome Newcomer by ACB has potentially sinister implications for individual privacy.234 If the welcoming committee sponsored by the local merchants is really a cloak-and- dagger group designed to report on the characteristics and status of new members of the communitys would paranoia be unjustified? Another trend that will have considerable long-range impact on credit bureaus is the increasing involvement of the banking industry in a variety of commercial fields that depend on computer technol- ogy and individualized information.

Computers also have enabled the banks to provide a wider variety of customer servicepayroll computations, accounting, mortgage servicing, and miscellaneous data-processing.235 One endeavor that major banking institutions recently have embarked upon is the bank or universal credit card. Universal card systems often require individual card transactions to be processed through an independent credit bu- reau.236 In California, however, a group of banks participating in a charge card plan apparently has established its own clearinghouse for credit transactions.237 The increasing acceptance of the universal credit card has enormous significance; it may herald the first stage of a checkless, cashless society in which all financial transactions are reflected as electronic debits and credits in the cardholder's com- puterized account that are shifted among sellers, and bank com- puters linked together by a nationwide network of communications lines.238 Present-day bank credit-granting easily can be incorporated * - nto t l1S system. In a checkless, cashless society, the credit-granting and credit- rating industries might cease to exist as separate entities.239 The customer in each transaction would inform the bank computer of the terms and conditions on which he had agreed to make pay- ment through a remote terminal located in the retail store. The deci- sion to grant credit would be made by the computer, on line and in real time, on the basis of the current status of the customer's com- puterized account and his past credit performance. If the transaction is approved, the merchant would be relieved of the risks of collec- tion. Over time, procedures of this type would result in a diminution of the need for independent credit information and credit bureaus would be under great pressure to combine with the bank credit card systems or to find other profitable uses for their dossiers. Judging from some of the practices described earlier in this section, the com- mercial outlets chosen almost certainly would result in a sacrifice of individual privacy. 235.

Congressional hearings have been held in both the Senate and the House,240 and Senator Proxw mire has introduced a bill that would add a new title to the recently erlacted Truth-in-Lending Act24l to provide safeguards in the field of credit-reporting.242 The purpose of the bill is "to protect con- sumers against arbitrary or erroneous credit ratings, and the unwar- ranted publication of credit information." It would require that: (1) credit bureaus employ effective procedures for guaranteeing the confidentiality of the information they collect; (2) credit information be withheld from noncreditors such as government investigatory agencies without the express consent of the person involved; (3) an individual be given an opportunity to correct inaccurate infor- mation in his credit file, and be notified when a derogatory public record item is entered in his credit record; (4) procedures be devel- oped for discarding irrelevant and outdated information in an in- dividual's credit file; and (5) users of credit reports notify an indiv- idual who has been adversely affected by a report and identify the bureau that issued it.243 State legislatures also are beginning to scru- tinize the credit industry.244 240. See note 190 supra. 241. Pub. L. No. 90-321 (May 29, 1968). 242. S. 823, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969); see 115 CONG. REC. S1163-69 (daily ed., Jan. 31, 1969). See also 114 CONG. REC. S10,029 (daily ed. Aug. 2, 1968). Broad hearings on the bill were held on May 19-23, 1969. 243. The current draft of S. 823 is not without deficiencies, however. For example, a strict reading of the bill, especially the language in section 164(c), limits its pro- hibitions to financial data and would not prevent free collection and utilization of the more dangerous forms of personal information described in text accompanying notes 190-94, 220-30 supra. Along the same lines, the bill requires only that the data subject be notified by the bureau "whenever information which is a matter of public record is obtained . . . and which is, or is likely to be interpreted by the agency or its clients as, adverse to the credit rating of the individual ...." Why shouldn't the individual be notified of the receipt of any form of adverse data whether or not it is from a public record? And why are his rights limited to sub- mitting "an explanatory statement with respect thereto"? Why shouldn't he be ena- bled to have the items expunged from the agency's Sle if he can demonstrate their inaccuracy or their lack of probity? Moreover, the bill does not expressly insure that the individual's "explanatory statement" accompany any report that is disseminated on the individual. Finally, in most cases damage suits under the bill will involve under $10,000, the basic jurisdictional amount required by 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (1964). Arguably, therefore, the proposed act should confer subject matter jurisdiction for disputes arising under it without regard to the amount in controversy. Section 166 of the bill, even section 166(b), which appears to be simply a limitations provision, is unclear on this point. 244. Cf.

By assuring the individual access to his credit file, the proposal en- ables people to have a modicum of control over the flow of inform- ation about them. It also represents an important step toward im- posing obligations on the credit bureau industry that will help achieve some type of balance between the need for accurate financial data to maintain the flow of credit throughout the nation and the preservation of the right of individual privacy. Obviously in the hope of avoiding the imposition of legislative restraints, ACB has developed a series of guidelines, mentioned earlier,245 to protect consumer privacy. Although these guidelines contain some safeguards, they were composed by an industry group with minimal consumer representation, they are not binding upon anyone particularly not upon the many bureaus unaffiliated with ACB and they are bountifully endowed with loopholes. For exam- ple, the ACB guidelines authorize the bureaus to collect matters of public record bankruptcies, lawsuits, arrests, indictment or conviction of crime but they are obliged only to "make a rea- sonable effort to learn and report disposition" of each such item.246 ACB seeks to absolve its members by putting the onus on the credit grantor to "inquire further as to the . . . disposition of any items of significance to his credit decision, or authorize the bu- reau to do so,"247 and by requiring the complaining consumer to sign "a statement granting immunity from legal action both to the credit bureau and to its sources of information."248 Perhaps ACB is to lDe congratulated for its effort; unfortunately, the CBS News experiment described earlier indicates that a number of bureaus See, e.g., N.Y. Sen. Introductory No. 338, N.Y. Assembly Introductory No. 570 (1968); Des Moines Register, April 14, 1969, at 10, col. 1. At this writing, however, none of them appears to have been enacted. Congressman Cornelius Gallagher commented on this situation in House Hearings on Commercial Credit Bureaus 115: In every State and every township in the country there are regulations con- cerning the transfer of ownership of dogs . . . yet there are really no regulations whatsoever pertaining to the transfer of this kind of information affecting a man's standing in the community, his dignity, his economic transactions, his private life, his very name itself ....

But even rigorous application of these guidelines does not obviate the need for further regulation. C. Regulating the Flow of Information The Need for a Broad Perspective The problem of safeguarding the individual's right to exercise some control over information relating to him must be approached with the realization that we are dealing with an entirely new me- dium of communications, one that is likely to restructure our so- ciety in much the same manner as did movable type or the Industrial Revolution.249 As suggested above, it may not be sufficient simply to apply the existing legal structure to the new fact situations created by computer technology. Unfortunately, the law historically has been slow to accommodate existing doctrines to new technologies. The length of time it took the law of warranty and tort to adjust to the automobile and the years of confusion that transpired before radio, television, and the airplane came under effective regulation testify to the legal system's somewhat ponderous reaction to novel situations posed by technological advances. Thus, it would not be surprising if the existing patchwork of legal proscriptions governing the misuse of individualized information -- although suggestive of meaningful restrictions on the increasing flow of highly personal data proves to be unequal to the challenges posed by the computer revolution. Before examining in detail the existing common-law doctrine and legislative pronouncements on the handling of personal infor- mation, an important reminder must be interjected. As the discus- sion of the proposed National Data Center and the credit bureau industry indicates, the patterns of growth and integratiorl among computerized data-processing services are widespread, complex, and 249.

How large a part and what kind of part do we want the computer, with its overriding skill in the rational analysis of the measurable data, to take in the decisions that determine the way this energy will be organized? A rather pessimistic assessment of our long-range ability to control computer technol- ogy is given in Clarke, The Mind of the Machine, PLAYBOY, Dec. 1968, at 116, 118: [I]t should be realized that as soon as the borders of electronic intelligence are passed, there will be a kind of chain reaction, because the machines will rapidly improve themselves.

It seems clear, therefore, that an attempt to achieve a workable balance between privacy and efficiency for any particular application of computer technology has little promise of success unless proper account is taken of the great variety of factors and relationships that tend to encourage computerization, system interconnection, and data-sharing. The National Data Center and credit bureaus merely provide two intrinsically interesting models for study the parameters of the problem have a much wider scope. Increased abrasion between computers and individual pri- vacy can be anticipated in many individual contexts.

V. THE CURRENT LAW OF PRIVACY: THE COMMON LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION The development of the law relating to personal privacy is a familiar tale. Indeed, the courts and commentators have had a strong interest in the subject during the past three quarters of a century, and the judicial and secondary literature is rich. No useful purpose would be served by tracing the path to the present state of the law once more. Rather, this section will simply try to indicate why the existing common-law doctrines are unable, especially in light of the implications of the first amendment, to provide a mean- ingful resolution of the computer-privacy issue. A. The Availability of Common-Law Protection The inadequacy of contemporary legal theories of privacy to deal with the realities of the computer age is clearest in the context of the common-law doctrines, which traditionally have used an in- trusion upon the individual by one of the mass media as a model.256 256. The exception, according to Dean Prosser, is the relatively small class of cases described by the term "intrusion," which usually involves some form of wiretapping or eavesdropping. Prosser, Privacy, 48 CALIF. L. REV. 383, 389-92 (1960). Privacy actions have been allowed even when the eavesdropper has not communicated the informa- tion to anyone else. See, e.g., Fowler v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 343 F.2d 150 (5th Cir. 1965); McDaniel v. Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 60 Ga. App. 92, 2 S.E.2d 810, 817 (1939) ("Publication or commercialization may aggravate, but the individual's right to privacy is invaded and violated nevertheless in the original act of intrusion."); LaCrone v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., 182 N.E.2d 15 (Ohio Ct. App. 1961); Roach v. Harper, 105 S.E.2d 564 (Sup. Ct. App. W. Va. 1958). Similar cases are collected in RESTATEMENT (SECOND) TORTS § 652B comment b (Tent. Draft No. 13, 1967). See also note 258 infra. In several cases that purport to be based on mass publication, the amount of publicity held sufiicient to sustain the action has been rather small. See, e.g., Brents v. Morgan, 221 Ky. 765, 299 S.\v. 967, 55 A.L.R. 964 (1957) (posting notice of plaintiff's indebted- ness in store window); Beiderman's of Springfield, Inc. v. Wright, 322 S.W.2d 892 (Mo. 1959) (plaintiff's indebtedness proclaimed orally in restaurant for three successive days). The minimum requirement seems to be that the information is made available to the general public, whether or not it actually reaches a large number of people. In Dean Bloustein's view, the mass publication requirement is based on the premise that "[u]nless there is a breach of a confidential relationship . . . the indig- nity and outrage involved in disclosure of details of a private life, only arise when there is a massive disclosure ...." In short, "[tghe damage is to an individual's self- respect in being made a public spectacle." Bloustein, Privacy els an Aspect of Human Dignity: An Answer to Dean Prosser, 39 N.Y.U. L. REV. 962, 981 (1964). In Hamberger v. Eastman, 106 N.H. 107, 206 A.2d 239 (1964), a case involving the bugging of a married couple's bedroom, there is language indicating that in some circumstances the plaintiff might not have to show that the defendant actually over- heard personal information: If the peeping Tom, the big ear and the electronic eavesdropper . . . have a</page><page sequence="69">April 1969] Computers and Privacy 1157 Thus, before an injured party can recover for a public disclosure of private facts the form of privacy invasion that seems to be most analogous to a misuse of computerized information257-he must show that the private information was given "publicity," or that it was communicated to the public at large.258 By way of contrast, a plaintiff in an action for defamation need show only that the deroga- tory statement in question was "published" that the defendant communicated it to a third party.259 A few exceptions to the mass publication requirement for privacy actions have been recognized, most of them involving instances in which "the information was gained by wrongful prying or . . . its communication involves a breach of confidence or the violation of an independent duty."260 These narrow exceptions have been relatively unimportant in the past, but they may prove crucial in constructing a workable common-law theory for remedying an improper dissemination of computerized information-the prototypical privacy case of the future.26l In terms of privacy in a computerized environment, the critical dissemination of information may well take place when one user of place in the hierarchy of social values, it ought not to be at the expense of a married couple . . . who have never asked for or by their conduct deserved a potential projection of their private conversations and actions .... Whether actual or potential such "publicity with respect to private matters of purely per- sonal concern is an injury to personality ...." 106 N.H. at 112, 206 A.2d at 242 (emphasis added). 257. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) TORTS § 652A (Tent. Draft No. 13, 1967): The right of privacy is invaded when there is (a) unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another . . . or (b) appropriation of the other's name or likeness . . . or (c) unreasonable publicity given to the other's private life . . . or (d) publicity which unreasonably places the other in a false light before the public .... See also Prosser, supra note 256, at 392-98; W. PROSSER, TORTS § 112, at 833-44 (3d ed. 1964). 258. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) TORTS § 652D, comment b (Tent. Draft No. 13, 1967): "Publicity" . . . differs from "publication," as that term is used . . . in connection with liability for defamation. "Publication," in that sense, is a word of art, which includes any communication by the defendant to a third person. "Publicity," on the other hand, means that the matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge. 259. See note 258 supra; W. PROSSER, TORTS § 109 (3d ed. 1964); Bloustein, supra note 256, at 979-80. 260. Bloustein, supra note 256, at 980. In this situation, the author concludes, the wrong "is not the disclosure itself, but rather the disclosure in violation of a relation- ship of confidence. Disclosure, whether to one person or many, is equally wrongful as a breach of the condition under which the information was initially disclosed." Prosser, supra note 256, at 393, is in substantial accord. See note 262 infra. 261. When the improper dissemination is a result of government action, the rights of the parties almost always will be determined by statute or regulation. See pt. VI infra.</page><page sequence="70">1158 Michigan Law Review [Vol. 67:1089 a time-sharing system permits another user to have access to private files, or when the operators of two different systems agree to ex- change tapes or interconnect their computers. Once an unauthorized user has gained access, he can interrogate an individual's computer- ized file at will or disseminate its contents still further, possibly causing damage that may never be traced to an abuse of the file. In many of these situations, it it doubtful that a traditionally required relationship of trust or confidence exists between the file subject- the potential plaintiff and the authorized user the potential de- fendant so as to give rise to a right of compensation. Ideally, the mere fact that the authorized user is a custodian of sensitive per- sonal information should establish a duty of conSdentiality as a matter of law, but the willingness of the courts to imply such an obligation is quite conjectural at this time.262 Another inherent difficulty of a common-law action based on the public disclosure of private facts is the rule that the information disclosed must be accurate. If it is notn in theory the plaintiff is re- mitted to an action for defamation to remedy his injury. In recent years this distinction has not been strictly adhered to; some privacy actions, notably those involving unwanted publicity that puts the plaintiff in a "false light in the public eye,"263 have beell viewed as a form of defamation.264 However, the Supreme Court appears to 262. Implying the duty would have the desitable effect of removing a latent anom- aly in the confidential-relationship theory. The anomaly arises from the fact that the confidentiality of a relationship depends upon the reasonable expectations of the party asserting an invasion of privacy; thus, an organization that is powerful enough vis-d-vis the individual to coerce or entice information from him while giving hinl notice of the fact that it will not keep the information in confidence could drastically reduce the scope of personal privacy. Josephson, Book Review, 15 UCLA L. REV. 1586, 1597-99 (1968). Apparently the English courts have been more alert than their American counter- parts to the unique dangers of handling personal information, and more willing to imply a confidential relationship. See, e.g., Jacob &amp; Jacob, Confidential Coma7lunica tions, THE NEW L.J., Feb. 6, 1969, at 133: It seems clear that the courts have imported ideas from the law of trusts and bail- ment into the law of confidence, for they now treat the fact that information is handed over for a particular purpose as itself normally sufficient for an implied bond of confidence to arise; and the donee of the information is not entitled to use the information so given for any purpose other than that for which it is given. 263. See note 257 supra. 264. The fact that the two theories have overlapped significantly in practice is discussed in Wade, Defamation and the Right of Privacy, 15 VAND. L. REV. 1093 (1962).

Hill.265 This dichotomy between fact and untruth seems to be increas- ingly unworkable. It is insensitive to the many subtle ways in which personal data may be distorted or misused in a society that puts a premium on collecting and transmitting large quantities of infor- mation about individuals and using it for many purposes. The biased "soft data" or evaluation, the derogatory entry that does not reveal subsequent ameliorating events, or the unexplicated bit of information that appears damaging when it is introduced in a context unrelated to the one in which it was collected, all may be "factual" in the strict sense of the word and yet not portray an in- dividual or his activities and aptitudes accurately. Thus, although the existing legal framework provides a theory for rectifying an im- properly disseminated truth as well as a theory for remedying an untruth, neither approach focuses sharply enough on the penum- bral area or takes account of the realities of modern communica- tions. As a result, an injured plaintiff is left subject to the risk of falling between the conceptual stools. A good illustration of the problems confronting an individual who believes that he has been injured by dissemination of soft data is provided by Ellsworth v. Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory, Inc.266 The plaintiff, an attorney, brought a defamation action claim- ing that his professional rating had been lowered for no apparent reason by a national directory. In affirming a directed verdict for the defendant, the Supreme Court of North Dakota indicated the high burden of proof that is likely to be imposed on a plaintiff when the damaging information is a subjective evaluation: [The plaintiff's] . . . witnesses do not all agree that his ability is "very high." . . . He complains that several lawyers in [his home town] were rated as "very high" when he was rated as only "high." There is no showing that these lawyers were not of exceptional ability.

The final problem in determining whether tort relief is available for an alleged invasion of privacy is, of course, the issue of whether the information in question can justifiably be categorized as "pri- vate." The difficulty of enunciating a manageable standard for de- termining what kinds of personal information should be protected from public disclosure was foreseen by Warren and Brandeis in their classic 1890 article advocating recognition of the right-of-privacy tort: Since . . . the propriety of publishing the very same facts may de- pend wholly upon the person concerning whom tlley are published, no fixed formula can be used to prohibit obnoxious publications.... In general . . . the matters of whicll the publication should be repressed may be described as those which concern the private life, habits, acts, and relations of an individual, and have no legitimate connection with his fitness for a public position which he seeks or for which he is suggested . . . and have no legitimate relation to or bearing upon any act done by him in a public or quasi public ca- pacity.268 Some of the uncertainty inherent in the suggested balancing of public and private interests was alleviated by incorporating an ex- tensive body of privilege into the nascent law of privacy. Indeed, Warren and Brandeis themselves stipulated that in addition to the mass media's freedom to publish "matters of public or general in- terest," the doctrine of privacy should be subject to the complex rules of privilege that had developed in the law of defamation as well as to the defense of consent.269 In theory, at least, these defenses mark off an area in which the individual's interest in preventing 267. 69 N.D. at 622, 289 N.W. at 105. 268.

It seems doubtful, however, that balances struck at a time when the principal threat to a person's emotional tranquillity and pri- vacy was the excesses of a newspaper gossip column270 can be applied without substantial modification to the incursions on individual freedom that are likely to arise in an age of electronic data-processing and high-speed transfers of large quantities of digital information over vast distances. For example, one extensive and relatively vague class of defamation privileges applies when "the publisher and the recipient have a common interest, and the communication is of a kind reasonably calculated to protect or further it.''27l A familiar application of this qualified272 privilege is the immunity of mutual credit organizations and credit-rating agencies in divulging financial data to those who have an "apparent, present interest in the re- port."273 In the contemporary environment, one in which credit reports often are cavalierly given over the telephone by ministerial personnel, presumably any party that knows a credit grantor's iden- tifying code number274 and has access to a telephone can tap a reser- voir of detailed financial information that currently is maintained on over 100,000,000 persons. Should the credit bureau be per- mitted to claim the privilege on the basis of the snooper's "ap- parent interest"? And what will be the law's reaction to computer- ized credit bureaus which will enable large institutional lenders to have direct access to bureau files from remote terminals located in 270.

The common-law limitations on the availability of the privacy tort are not the only constraints on securing protection for indi viduals. Ironically, in the context of the credit bllreau industry, federal statutory law may contribute to the defeat of individual privacy in a way that is tangentially related to privileges. When the credit bureaus organize a trade association, as, for example, ACB, the association's ability to regulate its members' dissemina- tion of credit information is circumscribed by the antitrust law. If the network suspects that a particular member or a credit granter is misusing credit information or supplying the bureau with incorrect data, the most effective method of maintaining file integrity is to deny the offending bureau access to the association's facilities or to terminate service to the offending subscriber. But the ACB is sub- ject to an antitrust consent decree that justifiably makes it wary of refusing to deal with any party requesting service.276 This unhappy squeeze between contributing to the invasion of privacy and violat- ing the antitrust laws was appropriately described by an ACB official as being caught "between Scylla and Charybdis."277 Along analo- gous lines, when a credit bureau opens its files to a government in- vestigator, it could seek to avoid liability by claiming, in the nature of a privilege, that it is obliged "to give information to proper au- thorities for the prevention or detection of crime."278 In view of these impediments to the vindication of individual privacy through the law of torts, it is small wonder that credit reports regularly are purchased and circulated by those who have no legitimate credit- granting purpose.279 B.

The plaintiff's ability to avoid this bar has been sub- stantially limited by the Supreme Court's decision in Time, Inc. v. Hill.280 In Hill, the plaintiff's suit for invasion of privacy arose out of a "fictionalized" magazine article describing an unpleasant, but newsworthy, event that had involved him and his family several years earlier.28l Although he was successful at trial, the Supreme Court ultimately held that the first amendment required the plain- tiff to meet the same burden of proof as in an action for defamation -Hill had to show that the defendant was guilty of knowing or reckless falsehood. This standard formulated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan282 has been quite diflicult to satisfy in practice.283 Hill may well have aborted much of the doctrinal growth ca- pacity of the law of privacy. At this writing, however, the precise implications of the decision must be considered unclear, especially since the case was founded on (and much of the opinion is devoted to) New York's somewhat peculiar privacy statute.284 If the Court's opinion is read narrowly, its effect may be limited to the "false light" line of privacy cases, which are viewed by some as similar to traditional defamation actions.285 Support for this view is found in the majority opinion's explicit reservation of the question whether the constitutional standards employed in defamation cases apply to the publication of truthful matters.286 On the other hand, the burden-of-proof standard used in Hill easily could be extended to 280. 385 U.S. 374 (1967). 281. The Hill family had been held captive by escaped convicts in a much- publicized incident, and the event later became the topic of a popular play. Life magazine published an article describing the play and distorting what actually had happened to the Hill family during their imprisonment. 282. 326 U.S. 254 (1964). 283. See, e.g., Nimmer, supra note 264, at 952: [Under the New York Times standard] the issue before the jury will not be the truth or falsity of the-defamatory statement, but rather the narrow question of the speaker's good faith. A jury will probably not go wrong on this narrow ques- tion of fact in view of the Court's statement in Times that the Constitution demands a standard of "convincing clarity." Moreover, the burden of proof on this narrow issue makes it increasingly likely that an appellate court will reverse jury determinations against the speaker when the standard of convincing clarity has not been met.

Only a few years have passed since Dean Prosser found that "there is still no reason to doubt this conclusion."289 In considering Hill in the context of the computer age, two rather basic questions spring to mind: (1) Should the decision be applied to the intrasystem dissemination of data maintained in com- puter networks, as well as to dissemination by the conventional media? (2) How does the decision affect transfers of information from computer systems to the news media? The answer to the first question is not as simple as might appear. If, as many commentators assert and as several passages in the Hill opinion indicate,290 the protection bestowed on the press by the Constitution is premised on the concept that the people must receive an unrestricted flow of information in order to govern themselves intelligently the "Meikeljohn interpretation" of the first amendment29l-then the role of the new information transfer technology must be evaluated in terms of this objective to determine how it should be character- ized.

Moreover, the existing entities typically are closed and not acces- sible, in any practical sense, to the vast bulk of the population.

A premature application of the first amendment could subvert the very values that the constitutional guaranty is designed to protect. The ramifications of transplanting privileges developed in the context of more traditional media to the information distribution aspects of computer technology is indicated by the broad scope ol the immunity from defamation and privacy actions that has been achieved by the press in recent years. As Professor Kalven has ob- served, the Hill decision points toward a time when anythlng that the press decides to print will be held newsworthy and therefore within the first amendment's protection and beyond the law of pri- vacy.297 This is consistent with trends in the closely related area of defamation.298 Since New York Times Co. v. Sullivan was decided, the class of "public officials" who must prove knowing or reckless disregard for the truth as a prerequisite to recovery299 has expanded to such an extent that it now appears that the term may encompass categories of individuals who are not even on the public payroll.300 296. The distinction between ideas and information, which are protected by the first amendment, and "purely commercial" advertising, which is subject to regulation, was established in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52 (1942). The continuing validity of this distinction is indicated by the citation of Valentine in the Hill decision, both by Justice Brennan for the majority and by Justice Harlan in dissent. 385 U.S. at 381, 405. Clearly, some types of computer use, such as the sale of computerized mailing lists, could be prohibited under this rationale. It also is at least arguable that the vast majority of computer operations in the private sector that generate information about specific individuals have such a limited relationship to the need for public informa- tion that their work product could be regarded as "commercial speech." Cf. Note, Freedom of Expression in a Commercial Context, 78 HARV. L. REV. 1 191, 1 194-203 (1965). 297. Kalven, supra note 29S, at 283-84: Although it was not necessary in Hill to delineate the outer boundaries of the newsworthy, the Court may be surprised by the extent of its commitment. The tort law of privacy has wrestled with the matter for some years now; and it is a rough generalization that the courts will not, and indeed cannot, be arbiters of what is newsworthy. Newsworthiness will almost certainly become a descriptive and not a normative term. But cf.

The Court then added, however, that "[t]he employee's position must be one which would invite public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it, entirely apart from the scrutiny and</page><page sequence="79">Apul 1969] Computers and Privacy  1167 In the same vein, the class of "public oflicials" who can defame in- dividuals with corresponding impunity is potentially as large.30l Obviously, there is a certain element of bootstrapping in the notion that the first amendment protects the publication of that which is newsworthy and it is the press that decides what is news- worthy. Perhaps in the context of a traditional invasion of privacy, which is well represented by the Hill case, there is usually some sem- blance of an objective standard an event or occurrence with some independent contemporary significance. But this may not always be true when the invasion of privacy takes the form of someone rum- maging through the entrails of the computer dossier maintained on one of his fellow men. In this context there is no newsworthy event other than the disclosure of the file's content. Although the Supreme Court's desire to preserve the policies favoring free dissemination of information that underlie the first amendment cannot be faulted in terms of a motivating theory, it is problematical whether these policies always require vindication at the expense of individual pri- vacy. In light of the broad implications of the new technology, it seems desirable to reflect carefully before extending the Hill privi- lege to the emerging information exchange formats. discussion occasioned by the particular charges in controversy." 383 U.S. at 87 n.l3. In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas observed: [I]f free discussion of public issues is the guide, I see no way to draw lines that exclude the night watchman, the file clerk, the typist, or for that matter, anyone on the public payroll. And how about those who contract to carry out governmental missions? Some of them are as much in the public domain as any so-called oEceholder....

Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 155 (1967): "We con- sider and would hold that a 'public figure' who is not a publia official may also recover damages for a defamatory falsehood whose substance makes substantial danger to reputation apparent, on a showing of highly unreasonable conduct ...." Chief Justice Warren, concurring in the Butts case, stated that "differentiation between 'public figures' and 'public officials' and adoption of separate standards of proof for each have no basis in law, logic, or First Amendment policy." 388 U.S. at 163. Cf. Kalven, supra note 295, at 307: "When . . . we remember that the appearance of victory for Harlan in Butts is a fluke, occasioned by Warren's vote to save the verdict for the plaintiff, it is apparent that the Court stands 5 to 4 in favor of the Brennan-Warren standard and hence in favor of an across-the-board application of New York Times." 301. In Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564 (1959), the Supreme Court held that falsehoods published by a government official acting within the scope of his discretionary au- thority are absolutely privileged. In dissent, Justice Brennan strongly criticized the scope of this privilege: I see no warrant for extending [the absolute privilege] to the extent done appar- ently to include every ofiicial having some color of discretion to utter communi- cations to Congress or the public .... [The majority's] approach seems to clothe with immunity the most obscure subforeman on an arsenal production line who has been delegated authority to hire and fire and who maliciously defsmes one he discharges. 360 U.S. at 587.</page><page sequence="80">1168 Michigan Law Review [Vol. 67:1089 One other facet of the problem deserves brief mention. In the information field, as elsewhere, the distinction between government and the private sector has become increasingly tenuous and the movement toward concentration is now quite pronounced. As Chief Justice Warren has observed: Since . . . World War II, there has been a rapid fusion of economic and political power, a merging of science, industry and government, and a high degree of interaction between the intellectual, govern- mental, and business worlds.... [N]ational and international prob- lems . . . demand national and international solution. While these trends and events have occasioned consolidation of governmental power, power has also become much more organized in what we have commonly considered to be the private sector. In many situa- tions, policy determinations which traditionally were channelled through formal political institutions are now originated and imple- mented through a complex array of boards, committees, commissions, corporations, and associations, some only loosely connected with the government.302 In the context of computer technology this trend is exemplified by the concentration of power over information and the institutional- ization of the flow of data among both public and private organiza- tions. Considerations such as these, which have been but a peripheral concern in cases dealing with freedom of the press, will be at the heart of the question of the extent to which a data system and its managers should be immunized from liability for transferring dam- aging private information about an individual. The potential for centralization of power that inheres in the new information transfer technology, the lack of internal safeguards, and the frequently secre- tive nature of the dissemination counsel a skeptical attitude toward any assertion that notions of free communication developed to safe- guard the press should be applied to a computer network, at least in the absence of a demonstration that the network is performing func- tions comparable to those discharged by traditional "news" media. Assuming that there are no insuperable constitutional obstacles to imposing legal inhibitions on the flow of information within and among computer systems, the question remains as to what standards can and should be imposed on the movement of information from computer systems to today's mass media. As statements in the Hill opinion indicate, information that the press obtains by intrusive or trespassory behavior still can create liability.303 This rule, although 302. Curtis Publishing Co. v.

This liaison is hardly unique to the computer age; the seductive minions of the press always have been able to cajole public and institutional officials into granting access to sensi- tive files by employing the blandishments of personal publicity or the threat of public criticism.304 The magnitude of the problem may be radically altered by the computer, however. If predictions made earlier in this Article con- cerning the increased computerization of personal information prove to be accurate,305 there will be a change in the quantity, sensitivity, and variety of information that the mass media may be able to ex- tract from a system once access to it has been secured. Moreover, when a reporter is able to procure dossiers from an investigatory agency, the printout is likely to consist of public-record data inter- mingled with subjective investigative reports, information given with the subject's actual or technical consent, and possibly informa- tude or private affairs in order to obtain information for publication. The power of the State to control and remedy such intrusion for newsgathering purposes cannot be denied ...." Private information that is obtained as a result of intrusive behavior should re- tain its nonprivileged character, even though the subject later becomes newsworthy. This rationale was adopted in Dietemann v. Time, Inc., 284 F. Supp. 925 (C.D. Calif. 1968), a case in which the plaintiff, apparently a quack doctor, had been surreptitiously photographed and tape-recorded in his home by Life magazine reporters posing as patients. The plaintiff was subsequently prosecuted for his illicit medical activities, and Life then published a story and some photographs obtained during the visit to his house. The court rejected a claim of privilege: Defendant [asserts] that because plaintiff was prosecuted all facts relating to his offenses became public information. If this be so, then the press may prepare a dossier on persons by illegal means, including trespass, pictures taken by hidden cameras in homes, offices, or other private places, conversations transmitted by radio transmitters, and even theft of material, then await a prosecution and publish everything which might in some degree relate to the offense charged, although such facts were not used as evidence or made a part of the public record. Such conduct cannot be justified under the right of freedom of the press. 284 F. Supp. at 931. 304. For example, consider the following description of conditions in the state of New York prior to the recent revision of police record-keeping systems: Violation of files was frequent. Police reporters looking for a good story were given free access to files on suspects, and as a result were able to publish in the newspaper some interesting but in many cases misleading, irrelevant, and dam- aging pieces of information. Those police chiefs who tried to protect the con- fidentiality of their files received poor press treatment, so that they would be encouraged to cooperate with the press more fully in the future.

A reporter unfamiliar with the structure of a computer network and the sources from which it draws its stored information is unlikely to be able to make intelligent judgments about the reliability or utility of variolls data items, as he might in the context of a manual filing system containing information from a circumscribed number of sources. It is also unrealistic to assume that all managers or proprietors of computer systems will be concerned about how the data they release to the press is used or interpreted. A modicum of restraint would be provided if the immunity afforded by Hill is not extended to those who supply private data to the mass media.306 In any event, the task of effectively protecting the individual from the risk of mass circulation of intimate and misleading information requires clear legal standards that impose a duty of care on the mass communica- tions media in handling dossier information. In addition, legal standards also must be fabricated for the operation of computerized data systems delineating what categories of information are avail- able: (1) for general release, (2) for circulation among specified other computer systems, or (3) for use only within the confines of a given system. Some suggestions along these and other lines will be offered at a later point in this Article.307 C. The Consent Placebo The process of establishing effective controls over the flow of computerized information is complicated by another weakness in the existing common-law tort of privacy the defense that the plain- 306. In Pearson v. Dodd, No. 21,910 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 24, 1969), it was held that newspaper reporters who had published information they knew had been obtained by an unauthorized intrusion into the plaintiff's files were not guilty of invasion of privacy. The court reasoned that the intrusion and the publication aspects of the tort "should be kept clearly separate." Id. at 6. Applying this analysis, the court con- cluded that the publication was within the ambit of the first amendment privilege and, since the reporters had not been parties to the intrusion, they were not held liable in tort: If we were to hold appellants liable for invasion of privacy on these facts, we would establish the proposition that one who receives information from an in- truder, knowing it has been obtained by improper intrusion, is guilty of a tort. In an untried and developing area of tort law, we are not prepared to go so far. Id. at 5-6. Since the plaintiff's employees who had originally intruded into his files were not parties to the action, the court did not reach the question of whether they would be able to assert the newspaper's first amendment privilege. Apparently the reporters did not advance this argument, but rather contended that the employees' disclosure was privileged by a publie policy in favor of exposing wrongdoing. Id. at 5 n.l9. 307.

Unfortunately, the application of both of these concepts by the courts has been somewhat Draconian. "Waiver" often is employed to characterize the plaintiff's participa- tion in some newsworthy event; however, the defense has been used under circumstances in which the notion of volitional acquiescence in the invasion is nothing short of unreaTistic.309 But even beyond that, the propriety of a defense to a privacy action should be assessed in terms of whether or not there is an overriding public interest in the free dissemination of information about the event, rather than on the basis of an assumption as to the plairltiff's intent. Fortunately, there is a growing realization that the consent de- fense is insensitive to the psychological pressures and the need for the material realities of modern life that often force individuals to disclose personal data.

Concern over chilling the dissemination of information by the press may extend to situations in which there is little apparent interest in communication of information. For example, in Gill v. Hearst Publishing Co., 40 Cal. 2d 224, 253 P.2d 441 (1953), a young couple who were photographed embracing in a public market place were held to have "waived" all right to object to publication of the photograph in a national magazine because, inter alia, the opposite result might have deterred the publication of all photographs of street scenes. The dissenting judge sharply criticized the artifi- ciality of the waiver rationale: By plaintiffs doing what they did in view of a tiny fraction of the public, does not mean that they consented to observation by the millions of readers of the defendant's magazine. In effect, the majority holding means that anything any- one does outside of his own home is with consent to the publication thereof, because, under those circumstances he waives his right of privacy even though there is no news value in the event. 40 Cal. 2d at 232-33, 253 P.2d at 441. cf. Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, 452 (Justice Brennan, dissenting): [The suggestion that the right of privacy is lost by the auditor's consent to the electronic transcription of the speaker's words] invokes a fictive sense of waiver wholly incompatible with any meaningful concept of liberty of communication. If a person must always be on his guard against his auditor's having authorized a secret recording of their conversation, he will be no less reluctant to speak freely than if his risk is that a third party is doing the recording....

Even a questionnaire sent out under the imprimatur of a federal agency has an inhibiting effect on many individuals; it may even benefit from the respon- dent's natural, but erroneous, assumption that it is a "crime" not to answer every inquiry by the sovereign.3l4 Although a great deal obviously depends on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the individual's personal characteristics, in many of these situa- tions "consent" is simply a conclusory epithet that serves to place responsibility for invasions of privacy on the victim. Of course, it is the data gatherer who should be subject to a duty to refrain from employing coercion to obtain information.

This evidence refutes the argument that an employee's response to a superior's request for information or action is a volun- tary response, and that an employee "consents" to an invasion of his dprivacy or the curtailment of his liberty.... For this reason, the bill makes it illegal for ofiicials to "request" as well as to "require" an employee to submit to certain inquiries or practices or to take certain actions.

PRIVACY AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH 4, 18: Behavioral science seeks to assess and to measure many qualities of man's mind, feelings, and actions. In the absence of informed consent on the part of the sub- ject, these measurelnents represent invasion of privacy. The scientist must there- fore obtain the consent of his subject. To obtain truly informed consent is often difiicult. In the first place, the nature of the inquiry cannot be explained adequately because it involves complex vari- ables that the nonscientist does not understand.... Secondly, the validity of an experiment is sometimes destroyed if the subject knows all the details of its conduct. . . * . * - In other situations the principle of free consent falls short for less obvious reasons. The subject may desire to please the experimenter, he may need to talk about very personal problems, or he may wish to place himself on exhibit.... Requiring consent can thus pose a problem for the investigator without providing the desired protection of subjects. 314. See note 174 supra and accompanying text.

I hereby release any claims, damages and suits whatsoever which may at any time be asserted by me by reason of such investigation.315 Clearly, personal privacy would become a chimera if adhesion pro- visions of this stripe were accepted by the courts. In sum, assertions of "consent" and "waiver" must be regarded with skepticism. The defenses should not be widely available to per- mit data collectors to shift the risks of their activities. Instead, a fiduciary duty that is related to the degree of coercion or pressure under which an individual yields control of personal information should be imposed on the data extractor.316 D. Privacy on the Societal Scale Some Bases for a Judicial Balance As a partial counterweight to the elaborate doctrinal network for securing the public interest in a free flow of information, the courts have delineated several constitutionally grounded rights in personal information that are deserving of protection. Given the danger that the first amendment rationale of Hill may be unduly extended at the sacrifice of informational privacy, these affirmative constitutional doctrines take on added significance. Perhaps the most clearly devel- oped of these is the right of associational privacy, which recognizes the "vital relationship between the First Amendment freedom to associate and privacy in one's association.''317 Thus, when the gov- ernment attempts to gather data concerning an individual's associa- tion with a group dedicated to the advancement of certain beliefs 315.

In the meantime, when full information is not available to him and when no alternative procedures to minimize the privacy problem are available, the relationship between the subject and the scientist (as well as with the institution sponsoring the scientist) must be based upon trust. This places the scientist and the sponsoring institution under a fiduciary obliga- tion to protect the privacy and dignity of the subject .... 317. NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462 (1958). See also Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516 (1960). The principle has been applied whether the organization is forced to reveal the names of its members, as in NAACP v. Alabama, or the indi- vidual is compelled to reveal all organizations of which he has been a member, as in Shelton v.

The threat that computer technology poses to associational pri- vacy is particularly acute. Electronic data-processing techniques facilitate the composition of lists of people associated with various types of activities and institutions from previously uncollated bodies of data; thus, relationships can be inferred from apparently disparate information.320 The risks created by this type of analysis will be magnified if the trends toward increased collection of individualized data, the computerization and centralization of information, and in- formation exchange through computer networks continue. As these practices become more prevalent, judicial relief based upon a con- stitutional right of associational privacy will be an increasingly im- portant source of protection even though it is available only when the "chilling effect" of the inquiry is in some measure attributable to state action rather than purely private conduct.32l In addition, 318. 357 U.S. at 460. 319.

For example, computerized financial records could easily provide a list of all payments that an individual has made to a given organization, or even to a person known to be an officer of the organization. Similarly, the records of an airline ticket reservation system can be audited to procure passenger lists of all flights taken by a surveillance suspect, and the passenger lists could be compared with a list of the known members of an organization. See text accompanying notes 103-04 supra. 321. The Supreme Court has not been very demanding in applying the state action requirement in associational privacy cases, however. In NAACP v. Alabama, the Court reversed a civil contempt judgment that had been entered against the NAACP for refusing to reveal "the names and addresses of all its Alabama members and agents" as required by state law. The Court rejected the argument that any repression follow- ing from disclosure would be the result of action by private parties. The "crucial factor," in the Court's view, was "the interplay of governmental and private action, for it is only after the initial exertion of state power [in demanding the list3 that private action takes hold." The NAACP had shown that "on past occasions revelation of the identity of its rank-and-file members has exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility." 357 U.S. at 462-63. Dicta in Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 486-87 (1960), indicates that the "private pressure" to be avoided is not merely the kind that follows from widespread publication of membership lists, but rather may be found in the actions of those who have economic power over the member of an unpopular group: Even if there were no disclosure to the general public, the pressure upon a teacher to avoid any ties which might displease those who control his professional destiny would be constant and heavy. Public exposure, bringing with it the possibility of public pressures upon school boards to discharge teachers who belong to un- popular or minority organizations, would simply operate to widen and aggravate the impairment of constitutional liberty.</page><page sequence="87">April 1969] Computers and Privacy 1175 the principle that a person is entitled to confidentiality in his insti- tutional and human relationships may provide a keystone for placing computerized information systems under effective legislative or ad- ministrative controls that go beyond the minimal level of protection that can presently be afforded by the courts through the Constitution and tort litigation. Closely related to the right of associational privacy is another judicially recognized individual interest the right to possess ideas and beliefs free from governmental intrusion. As the Supreme Court recently stated in Schneider v. Smith,322 first amendment guarantees and the concept of associational privacy "create a preserve where the views of the individual are made inviolate. This is the philosophy of Jefferson that 'the opinions of men are not the object of civil govern- ment, nor under its jurisdiction .... X323 As is true of associational privacy, the information-handling capacity of the modern technologies poses a special threat to privacy of ideas and beliefs. Computers provide governmental and nongov- ernmental institutions with increased ability to store, retrieve, and analyze an individual's opinions as reflected in psychological tests, attitude surveys, machine-assisted instruction, and simulations. These and other techniques for securing subjective data are sufficiently subtle that the individual may not even suspect that his basic beliefs are being scrutinized or that his responses will be preserved and ex- amined by people beyond his immediate ken. Preservation of the fruits of this type of data surveillance also threatens another personal interest that some courts have recognized the individual's ability to make a fresh start and escape from past errors when there is no overriding public interest in the preservation and chronologically remote disclosure of the information.324 The judicial recognition of freedom of association and belief is part of a tradition that is even more basic to the nation's philosoph- 322. 390 U.S. 17 (1968). 323. 390 U.S. at 25.

As Justice Douglas remarked in his opinion for the Court in Schneider: "The purpose of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, unlike more recent models promoting a welfare state, was to take government off the backs of people."325 This attitude certainly is reflected in the spate of Supreme Court decisions recog- nizing various "zones of privacy."326 It is axiomatic that the power conveyed by widespread surveil- lance or information control can constrict individual freedom, and pressures that lead in that direction must be resisted. Arguments or supplications couched in terms of governmental economy or gains in administrative efficiency cannot justify every demand for greater power to extract, manipulate, store, and disseminate personal data. In the past these very objectives have been advanced and then re- jected as justifications for universal fingerprinting327 or passports for travel within the country.328 By way of contrast there is the example of the Chinese Communist Party's attempt to register and monitor every household in China.329 Today, however, the accelerating development of technology and the almost exponential expansion of the ability to manipulate per- sonal information in variegated ways may be altering the balance between the individual citizen and those institutions in society that seek to exercise control over him.

The Supreme Court appears to have recognized this in recent electronic eavesdropping cases; it has employed expansive general principles to protect a per- son's legitimate expectations concerning personal privacy.331 In the process, the Court has used the traditional constitutional restraints on search and seizure of tangible objects to restrict governmental acquisition of personal information.332 The need to accommodate existing legal doctrine to meet the ex- cesses of a new communications medium is hardly a novel or revolu- tionary idea. Indeed, our current theories of privacy emerged from a recognition that the mass media possess unique abilities to harm the individual. As Dean Bloustein has observed: 330. Josephson, Book Review, 15 UCLA L. REV. 1586, 1596 (1968): It may be fair to say that the law need not prevent the disclosure of informa- tion about another, where the speaker himself has not manifested suicient con- cern in its disclosure to safeguard against its dissemination. This view would justify the leeway given to field-glass snoops and naked-ear eavesdroppers. Both types of intruders may be frustrated by simple precautions and the burden of self-protection is not a heavy one. Where electronic surveillance and undercover spies are involved, however, the individual may be truly incapable of coping with the threat to his privacy other than by refusing to talk. 331. See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 352 (1967), a case involving a police wiretap on a public telephone: No less than an individual in a business oice, in a friend's apartment, or in a taxicab, a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. See also Note, From Private Places to Personal Privacy: A Post-Katz Study of Fourth Amendment Protection, 43 N.Y.U. L. REV. 968, 981 (1968): [T]he Katz decision has pointed the way towards a complete reorientation in the analysis of problems relating to governmental intrusion into individuals' private affairs. Rather than relying on an interpretation of the nature and legitimacy of the Government's searching activity, the Court's holding was based solely on the individual's expectation of privacy.... It follows that even inadvertent, non- purposeful government activity may constitute an "unreasonable search" if it un- earths nonpublic information legitimately within the personal dominion of the aggrieved party. 332. See, e.g., Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 353 (1967) ("[Wle have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, overheard without any 'technical trespass under . . . local property law.'"); Berger v.

Resources of isolation, retribution, retraction and correction were very often available against the gossip but are not available to any- where near the same degree, against the newspaper report.... Gossip arose and circulated among neighbors, some of whom would know and love or sympathize with the person talked about.... . . . A newspaper report, however, is spread about as part of a commercial enterprise among masses of people unknown to the sub- ject of the report and on this account it assumes an imperious and unyielding influence. Finally . . . the newspaper tends to be treated as the very fount of truth and accuracy, and tends to command open and unquestioning recognition of what it reports. Thus, only with the emergence of newspapers and other mass means of communication did degradation of personality by the public disclosure of private intimacies become a legally significant reality.333 Computerized information-handling elevates these difficulties of context and interpretation to a new order of magnitude. The com- puter printout is less likely to reflect or reveal the bias or the selec- tivity of the information gatherer than is the newspaper article or television report.334 Similarly, if the newspaper is viewed as a "fount of truth and authenticity," the computer projects an infallible and omniscent image across the mind of the average American, despite its occasional and well-publicized foibles. Consequently, the probability that an apparently disinterested account or report will be accepted as true-a consideration that disturbed Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion in Time, Inc. v. Hill335-seems much more substantial when the report is based on a computerized dossier than when it appears in a newspaper article or a television newscast. Most dangerous of all, perhaps, is the fact that computerized infor- mation-handling is a low-visibility operation. An individual may never learn that a dossier exists or have any real knowledge of what is in it. If he does know of its existence, he is not likely to receive 333.

Thus, citizens generally have no opportunity to correct or augment the contents of their files or con- trol their use. Decisions affecting their personal destinies, may be made on the basis of unseen data from unknown sources having untested reliability. But beyond these apprehensions concerning the dangers to par- ticular individuals, the unregulated computerization of personalized information may have a numbing effect on the value of privacy as a societal norm and may debilitate the citizen's conception of the government as a benevolent institution. As in the case of electronic surveillance, the climate or atmosphere of suspicion engendered by an accumulation of invasions of privacy is of far greater concern than the direct harm caused by the incidents themselves.336 In a dissenting opinion in Lopez v. United States,337 Justice Brennan drew a distinction between informers and informers who carry con- cealed recording or transmitting devices. He was concerned about the special risks to which individuals are subjected when law enforce- ment agencies use electronic surveillance devices, and, in turn, about the implications that these risks have for society as a whole: It is not an undue risk to . . . compel [people] to use discretion in choosing their auditors, to make damaging disclosures only to per- sons whose character and motives may be trusted.

There is only one way to guard against such a risk, and that is to keep one's mouth shut on all occasions.338 Another observer has stated: "Even quite reasonable surveillance practices which should be permissible in themselves, may in the aggregate form be the basis of a terribly oppressive society."339 This 336.

The existing com- mon-law structure therefore does not appear readily transferable to regulate the use of personal information by computer networks whose privacy-invading activities are far more subtle than those that traditionally have confronted the courts. The deficiencies of current doctrine will become increasingly apparent as public and private sector data systems continue to integrate. Thus, if the individual is to retain any meaningful control over decisions affecting his life and if society is to avoid becoming enveloped in an Orwellian miasma, the law must adjust and impose limitations and responsibilities upon the proprietors of systems that process personal information. If it fails to do this, these data managers inevitably will wield an increas- ing measure of power as a greater proportion of each individual's life history is recorded, centralized, and made available on computer networks. VI. THE HANDLING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: CURRENT PRACTICE In seeking guidance for developing an adequate system of legal principles to regulate the flow of personal information in society, it is appropriate to examine the most comprehensive contemporary statutory and administrative framework concerning data transfers- the body of rules controlling the federal government's power to ac- quire and disseminate information. It is especially appropriate to undertake such an analysis if, as concluded in the preceding section, the common-law remedies are inadequate to meet the new chal- lenges. Inasmuch as certain aspects of the federal experience provide insights into the special problems created by information interchange between the private and public sectors and among the federal gov- ernment and other units of government, the following discussion also is intended to indicate some of the consequences of the national computer networks which are on the horizon. 340.

Confidentiality The Census Bureau Model The Bureau of the Census long has been one of the federal gov- ernment's chief data gatherers. The decennial census has evolved from the simple "enumeration" of the populace described in the Constitution34l to a comprehensive survey seeking numerous items of data. Citizens are now required to answer questions about their health, employment, finances, and even the number of bathrooms in their homes.342 Several of the questions on recent censuses have been included at the request of social planners from both govern- mental and nongovernmental institutions, as well as industry groups desirous of procuring information that will aid in making marketing * - c .eclslons. Information for the census is extracted under threat of criminal penalties,343 and, on the few occasions when the propriety of census techniques has been questioned in the courts, the Bureau's broad discretion has been upheld.344 In recent years, however, the symbi- otic relationship between the Census Bureau's seemingly insatiable appetite for personal information and the Damoclean sword of criminal sanctions has engendered an increasing number of com- plaints from the public, with resulting criticism in Congress.345 A proposal to demand data on religious affiliations was a special target of the critics,346 and that line of inquiry was eliminated from the 341.

But the dissatisfaction runs deeper and a number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would sharply limit the kinds of questions that respondents are legally required to answer.347 In April 1969 the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, chaired by Senator Ervin, held broad hearings on the status and the possible development of a theory to protect citizens from abusive inquiries by the government.348 Notwithstanding the recent criticisms, it generally is agreed that the Census Bureau has an unequalled record among federal agencies in preserving the confidentiality of personal information.349 In fact, the Census Bureau's enviable history frequently has been cited by advocates of a National Data Center as indicative of the type of security that can be achieved by a statistical organization.350 The basic confidentiality provisions of the Census Act impose three prohibitions on Census Bureau employees. They may incur criminal penalties35l if they (1) use the information furnished under the provisions of . . . [the Act] for any purpose other than the statistical purposes for which it is supplied; or (2) make any publication whereby the data furnished by any par- Abram, President, American Jewish Committee); id. at 3 (statement of Representative Cornelius Gallagher).

In 1963, for example, the Census Bureau reportedly provided the American Medical Association with a "statistical" list of 188 doctors residing in Illinois. The list was broken down into more than two dozen income categories, and each category was further subdivided by medical specialty and area of residence.353 It also is likely that there is a fair amount of data disclosure at the information-gathering level by the large corps of people employed to carry out the Bureau's periodic canvassing.354 This type of abuse may be reduced by wider use of direct mail techniques. One basic irlfirmity in the Census Act restrictions is their am- biguity, which makes consistent application difficult. The classifica- tion of information as "statistical" within the meaning of subdivi- sion (1), rather than as "identifying" or "surveillance," will depend in large measure on how the information is presented and what can be inferred from it by a user who is intimately familiar with the subject matter of the underlying question. It also may be unrealistic to require Census Bureau employees to make hypothetical judgments about whether or not a user will be able to determine the identity of respondents from a particular tabulation. The task of making a present judgment about a possible future use is bound to become more difficult as computer analysis techniques become more refined. Moreover, the Bureau's burden of making these judgments will increase because requests to release data in small aggregates of respondent units rather than large tabulations are certain to prolif- erate as a result of the trend toward computer analysis of "micro- data" in the social sciences.355 Pressure for the relaxation of Census' confidentiality restrictions has come from other sources. In St. Regis Pater Co. v. United StAtes,356 the Supreme Court held that the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act did not prevent other branches of the government from compelling a respondent to produce file copies of reports that 352. 13 U.S.C. § 9(a) (1964). 353.

The Court reasoned that the rights granted by the statute were erlforceable only against the Census officials receiving the information, and did not attach to the informa- tion itself. Fortunately, the St. Regis case was legislatively overruled in 1962,357 and retained copies of census reports are now immune from subpoena. A number of disturbing questions raised by the case remain, however. For one thing, St. Regis can be interpreted as supporting the proposition that, in spite of the collecting agency's pledge of confidentiality, a copy of any report supplied to the Government is amenable to compulsory process in the absence of a specific statute exempting it.358 Moreover, if the Census Act's confidentiality restric- tions are enforceable only against officials authorized to gather the information initially, it is conceivable that the statutory prohibition cannot be enforced against a third party who lawfully obtains in- formation from the Bureau and then proceeds to misuse the data. In any event, the protection afforded by the legislative resolution of the St. Regis affair may prove to be more apparent than real. It does not prevent any interested agency from framing a question- naire asking questions that appear on a census survey, thereby compromising the latter's confidentiality. Moreover, many agencies use the ploy of having the Census Bureau conduct surveys for them.359 This technique enables the inquiring agency to procure 357. 13 U.S.C. § 9(a)(3) (1964)- 358. 368 U.S. at 218: Congress did not prohibit the use of the reports per se but merely restricted their use while in the hands of those persons receiving them, i.e., the government officials. Indeed, when Congress has intended like reports not to be subject to compulsory process it has said so. 359. A list furnished the author by Senator Ervin's oflice shows that in a period of approximately two years the Census Bureau performed surveys for over twenty federal, state, and local governmental organizations. In many instances the surveys were taken weekly, monthly, or annually. It is difficult to determine how many re- spondents were involved; the figure 6,000,000 seems conservative. A perusal of some of the questionnaires reveals them to be lengthy and, on occa- sion, intrusive. A document entitled Longitudinal Retirement History Survey, col- lected by the Census Bureau for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, is almost twice as long as the 1970 census. It is being sent to a sample group of recent retirees who are receiving social security beneSts. The survey apparently is a response to a recommendation by the Advisory Council on Social Security that data be col- lected on people who come on the benefit rolls before age sixty-five. Some of its inquiries, in addition to numerous probing interrogatories about the respondent's finances and past employment, include: What have you been doing in the last four weeks to find work? When you retire, do you expect to live here or somewhere else? Where? Taking things all together, would you say you're very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy these days? Do you have any artificial dentures? Is there some kind of care or treatment that you have put off even though you may still need it? What is this care or treatment for?</page><page sequence="97">Computers and Prittacy 1185 April 1969] the desired data directly and in the precise form it deems neces- sary. At the same time, it gets the benefit of the quasicoercive demeanor of an official Census Bureau questionnaire.360 Further- more, once the collected data is transferred to the agency that re- quested the survey,36l the excellent record of the Census Bureau be- comes irrelevant. At this point the requesting agency has the capacity to use and disseminate the data in any way that its officials and em- ployees feel is appropriate. Most of the data turned over by Census will be in the form of computer tapes, and this type of transfer has special implications, which are discussed in the next section of this Article.362 Another potential deficiency in the Census Act is the provision granting the Secretary of the Department of Commerce discretionary authority to "furnish to Governors of States . . . courts of record, and individuals, data for genealogical and other proper purposes, from the population, agriculture, and housing schedules,"363 subject to the palliative that "[i]n no case shall information furnished . . . be used to the detriment of the persons to whom such information relates."364 This grant of authority operates as an ill-defined excep- Do you (or your spouse) see or telephone your parent(s) as often as once a week?

Senator Ervin has introduced a bill designed to remedy intrusive federal data- gathering activities. S. 1791, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969). The bill was the focal point of the April 1969 hearings of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. See note 348 supra. See also text accompanying notes 544-45 infra. 360. Although most of the surveys conducted for other agencies by the Census Bureau are voluntary, that fact often is not indicated on the documents. A recent voluntary home survey questionnaire was boldly marked: "This Form Should Be Completed And Returned Whether You Are A Renter Or A Homeowner, Whether You Live In A One-Family Home, Or A House With Two Or More Families, An Apartment, Or Any Other Type Of Building." This approach apparently is typical. In addition, respondents who do not reply are sent follow-up letters (occasionally by certified mail) or receive personal visits. 361. The Census Bureau normally codes and edits the data, sends one copy to the requesting agency, and retains the raw data and one copy of the coded data.

Indeed, in one state case "detriment" was corlstrued to mean that the subject of the data must be deprived of something that is lawfully his366 a test that appears impossible to satisfy except under the most limited circumstances. The most serious limitation on confidentiality restrictions of the type governing the Census Bureau, however, is not the scheme's po- tential irleffectiveness as a means of deterring wrongful disclosures by agency personnel. Rather, it is the fact that information transac tions are engaged in without giving notice and an opportunity to be heard to the citizen whose files are subject to the risk of wrongful dis- closure or disclosure under the statutory provision described in the preceding paragraph. This is coupled with a total failure to deal with the problem of how an individual can correct erroneous entries or add ameliorating information to the contents of a potentially damaging file. Admittedly, the absence of procedural safeguards has not had catastrophic consequences in the past, primarily because the Census Bureau has operated on the basis of aggregate data and has restricted itself to relatively bland statistical endeavors. But the twin pressures of increased information-gathering and widespread detailed multi- variate analysis will be felt not only by Census but by all informa- tion-handlirlg agencies. As a result, fissures in the existing structure for privacy protection are almost certain to develop. B. Transfers of Information Among Federal Agencies As has been pointed out earlier,367 the proliferation of large time- sharing computer systems and the existing cost levels are motivating 365. 13 U.S.C. § 9(a) (1964). The primary utilization of this exception seems to be by individuals procuring data from earlier censuses about themselves, especially for proof of age in connection with Social Security, Medicare, and other benefits. See Hearings on the 1970 Census Questions Before the House Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1966) (statement of Dr. A. Ross Eckler, Director, Bureau of the Census). 366. In Edwards v. Edwards, 239 S.C. 85, 121 S.E.2d 432 (1961), the defendants in an inheritance dispute contended that the plaintiffs' use of census records as evidence was detrimental to their interests. The South Carolina Supreme Court rejected this construction of the Act: The use of such information to the detriment of those to whom it relates does not mean detriment in the sense of a financial loss flowing from establishing the truth in a Court of law. If plaintiff is the . . . brother of defendants, he is entitled to an equal share and they have not been deprived of anything that was lawfully theirs but only that which they had no lawful right to claim as theirs. 239 S.C. at 91, 121 S.E.2d at 435. 367.

Within the federal government, this tendency is legitimized by a statute granting the Director of the Bureau of the Budget power to "require any Federal agency to make available to any other Federal agency any information which it has obtained from any person."368 This authority can be exercised, however, only if at least one of the follc)wing conditions is met: (1) the information consists of statistical summaries, (2) it is not confidential at the time of transfer, (3) the persons who supplied the information have con- sented to its release, or (4) the transferee agency has power to collect the information itself.369 Moreover, transferred information is sllb- ject to the same confidentiality restrictions that protected it in the originating agency, and any employee of the transferee agency who violates these restrictions is subject to the same penalties that apply to employees of the trans£eror organization.370 These provisions are logical enough on their face and seem to present little direct threat to privacy.37l However, as is true of much of the existing regulatory scheme, they were conceived with the model of a manual transfer of manila folders irl mind. Thus, they may prove to be quite difficult to apply in the context of frequent large-scale transfers of information among compatible agency com- puter systems. Computerized information can be transferred either by manually exchanging it in stored form-a reel of magnetic tape or a magnetic disc or by feeding it directly from one computer memory unit to another through a machine interface. Both proce- dures permit the data to be duplicated by the transferee unit so that the original can remain with the collecting agency. The transferred information often will not carry any indication of its source, partic- ularly if it is used by the borrower on a random-access basis or is amalgamated with other data or transmogrified in some other fash- ion. In short, the indicia of the process of transferring computerized data are so evanescent that there does not appear to be any effective way to insure that the limitations on the Bureau of the Budget's statutory authority are honored. Although it is feasible for the trans- 368. 44 U.S.C. § 422(e) (Supp. III, 1965-1967). This power is subject to several exceptions, the most notable of which encompasses "the obtaining or releasing of information by the Internal Revenue Service." Id. The term "Federal agency" is defined by 44 U.S.C § 426(a) (Supp. III, 1965-1967) to include "any executive depart- ment, commission, independent establishment, corporation owned or controlled by the United States, board, bureau, division, service, office, authorityJ or administration in the executive branch of the Government . . .

And in cases in which the borrowed information is integrated with other data, the process might not even be feasible except in the most gen- eral way. Moreover, it is unrealistic to assume that middle- and low- level administrators are familiar with the disparate standards of confidentiality and penalties for violations that are in force in all of the possible transferor organizations. Of course, it is technologically possible (although a dubious use of computer capacity) to program all potential transferor computers so that they will provide this in- formation with each bit of data they transfer. Then, in the styTe of some majestic Wagnerian prologue, each transferee computer would print out the rules and regulations applicable to the use of any bor- rowed information that is to be retrieved. Whether or not they would be read or followed is another matter. At some point, surely, the basic assumption underlying the statutory transfer restrictions on the Budget Bureau that privacy can be protected by aggregating confidentiality requirements must break down by virtue of its sheer complexity. The House Committee on Government Operations examined an aggregation scheme as a method of protecting privacy in the context of a data center consist- ing of information from thirty to forty federal agencies. The com- mittee rejected this system as impractical: Each agency would have numerous bureaus and other subdivisions. For each of these hundreds of bureaus there would have to be de- veloped a complicated set of standards whereby every type of report would have to be evaluated. . . . [E]ach of the hundreds of bureaus would have to rate every type of information it possesses separately for all other bureaus that might request the information.372 The obvious alternative to an aggregation scheme, a single scale of confidentiality that can be used to rate every report received by the Government, also was rejected The committee was of the opinion that the imposition of a uniform scale would obscure the fact that "the sensitivity of a given document is not intrinsic, but varies with the relationship between the agency gathering the data and the agency receiving it."373 372.

As will be discussed more fully in a later section,374 the answer may lie in proper application of the technology itself. Hierar- chical storage techniques, privacy systems built into the hardware and software, and use of cryptography principleall supported by recast legislative and administrative regulationmay provide the necessary protective mix. Consequently, a number of studies and experimental information-sharing projects must be undertaken be- fore the intricacies of maintaining confidentiality of personal infor- mation that moves on an interagency basis can be appreciated. Un- fortunately, there is substantial danger that the present trend toward data transfers will continue unabated, with yesterday's aggregated confidentiality restrictions375 providing a shield against information infiltration that is as porous as McNamara's Vietnam Wall. C. Federal-State-Local Transfers of Information The trend toward data-sharing within the federal government has been paralleled by the development of numerous data centers at the regional,376 state,377 and local378 levels. There has also been in- 374. See pt. VII.A. infra. 375. An excellent example of the disregard for confidentiality within the federal government arising from cavalier data transfers is the wide latitude permitted in the disclosure of income tax returns; see Treas. Reg. § 301.6103(a) l(f) (1965): [I]f the head of an executive department . . . or of any other establishment of the Federal Government, desires to inspect, or to have some other officer or em- ployee of his department or establishment inspect, a return . . . in connection with some matter officially before him, the inspection may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury or the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the delegate of either, be permitted upon written application ....

The prosecutor asked an Internal Revenue agent to inspect the tax returns of the veniremen on the jury panel, and to provide a summary of events in their history of dealings with the IRS which might tend to make them unfavorably disposed toward the prosecution. This list was used as a basis for peremptory challenges, and, in spite of the fact that no comparable information was available to the defendant, the court held that this was permissible under the statute and applicable regulations. 376.

In some respects, the sharing of information among different levels of government, and perhaps even with the private sector, is more threatening to individual privacy than the transmission of data within the federal government. In the first place, multilevel systems of this type are bound to increase the potential audience for sensitive data. In addi- tion, local information handlers may be more likely to be inefficiont, insensitive, or animated by malice or idle curiosity about the content of the data than are their federal counterparts. In many cases they are in a better position to harm individual citizens through misuse of personal information than relatively remote federal officials. More- over, the difficulties of interpreting noncomparable bodies of infor- mation are likely to arise in more extreme form when data centers that have been designed to meet the particular needs of different levels of government later are patched together to effect data trans- fers.379 In spite of these concerns, programs already are in existence that provide for the sharing of personal data between the federal govern- ment and the states. For example, section 6103 of the Internal Rev- enue Code grants access to federal income tax returns to state officers charged with the collection of any state tax.380 The treasury regula- tions under this section also open federal estate and gift tax returns to states that are willing to reciprocate by allowing the federal gov- ernment to peruse their tax records.38l Over forty states have entered "agreements of cooperation" with the Internal Revenue Service,382 379. Cf. Hearings on Data Processing Management 24-25 (statement of Phillip S. Hughes, Deputy Director of the Bureau of the Budget): The incompatibility that continues to exist among equipment and software remains a serious obstacle in making the most effective and efficient use of our vast ADP resources. This problem is assuming even greater significance in view of the accelerated trend toward the development of systems that involve the exchange of data in machine-processable form among many different computers. This trend is illustrated by the growing interchange of information among Federal, State, and local governments, between thc private sector and governmental agencies, and within major segments of Government and industry. 380.

Aban- donment of the program is not being suggested; an evaluation of the privacy-protecting procedures that are being employed does seem appropriate, however. A tax return in the wrong hands can result in great damage to an individual and, in certain circumstances, ele- ments of organized crime or unscrupulous political operatives would be very interested in seeing selected tax returns. They undoubtedly would be willing to pay handsomely for that privilege, and this makes the maximum statutory penalty of 1,000 dollars fine and one year imprisonment for wrongful disclosure384 seem dangerously in- effective as a deterrent. Comparable threats to personal privacy are inherent in the devel- opment of "integrated information systems" for law enforcement agencies. This is a technique that has been advocated to counteract the difiiculties that the police encounter in dealing with a highly mobile criminal population. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has established a National Crime Information Center, which eventu- ally will enable the states and many of the large cities to have im- mediate access to computerized files of stolen property and wanted persons.385 Although application of the new technologies to public- record information of this sort does not pose a significant indepen- dent threat to personal privacy, it is obvious that a wide variety of information is useful in law enforcement. Thus, pressures to include more extensive data in the system are almost certain to increase.386 383. CONC. REC. ER656 (daily ed. Apr. 3, 1968). 384. INT. REV. CODE of 1954, § 7213.

New York, which is probably the leader among the states in computerizing police records, already has in operation the essential features of a system built around a single computer center in which the various state and local law enforcement agencies store and retrieve data through remote-access terminals.387 This system could easily be linked both to the FBI's center, and, in the other direction, to police station houses and individual patrol cars.388 The same pressures that are leading to information integration among different levels of government may lead to even more expan- sive systems. In today's climate of student activism and public and governmental reactivism, it is not unreasonable to believe that inter- faces between law enforcement and educational data centers are feasible. After all, the Justice Department is obligated to enforce recent federal legislation concerning students who engage in disrup- tive campus activities,389 and proposals for comparable state legisla- tion are becoming increasingly fashionable.390 The process would be exedited for all concerned if data collected by the FBI, the Justice Department, local law enforcement agencies, and the universities could be coordinated and distributed to the interested organizations. But the risks to the individual are enormous. A refined sifting process to insure that damaging information is not allowed to flow unverified and uncontrolled among local, state, and federal organizations is needed. Unfortunately, the designers and advocates of integrated information systems have been more concerned with making data available than they have been with puters will store and retrieve. Data concerning a person's political beliefs and asso- ciations, gathered by various Federal security agencies, thus will become part of the crime data bank. The implications are obvious: every local police official will be able to learn with facility not only whether a suspect has a criminal record, a proper disclosure, but also whether he has at all deviated from his community's political or social norms, a highly improper disclosure which threatens the en- joyment of first amendment protections.

D. The Federal Government and the Public- The Freedom of Information Sct The disclosure of information gathered by the federal govern- ment to private individuals and organizations creates its own threats to personal privacy. In many cases, the information held by the gov- ernment has been extracted from the individual under a statutory mandate or through the use of subtle forms of coercion.392 Nonethe- less, if any of this vast store of personal data finds its way into one of the mass media, the broad implications of Time, Inc. v. Hill393 and other first amendment cases indicate that it can be used with virtual impunity. The problem is not simply the press. Employers, creditors, business rivals, and a multitude of others having an "interest" in a particular individual also have occasion to seek information from the files of the federal government. The past balance between the Government and the public has been altered radically by the enactment in 1967 of the Freedom of Infor- mation Act,394 a relatively short piece of legislation that requires the 391. For example, the TASK FORCE REPORT: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 74-75 devoted a page and a half to the problem of individual privacy and concluded, "This problem still needs much more studyJ analysis and judgment." The vulnerability of computerized crime information systems is illustrated by the following account of difficulties in the New York State Identification and Intelligence System: The reluctance of law enforcement agencies to share information on organized crime may pose fatal problems for a state plan to develop a central computerized source of information about criminals. * * * v "When it gets right down to it," [a] state ofBicial said, "I just don't know whether [New York County District Attorney Frank S.] Hogan is going to let N.Y.S.I.I.S. see the sensitive kind of stuff he's got in his files, especially when there's a possibility it might fall into the hands of a corrupt sheriff or police chief at the other end of the state."

The purpose of the statute is to insure that the public has access to enough information to enable it to scruti- nize the activities of federal administrators, thereby providing a theoretical check on abuse. In the process of fulfilling this function, however, the Act is certain to have a profound effect upon an indi- vidual's capacity to prevent the circulation of information that he has divulged to the Government under various federal reporting programs.395 The conflict between the public's right to know and the individ- ual's right to have some control over the flow of personal informa- tion held by the Government is extremely difficult to resolve, and it is doubtful that new legislation-even if it contained significantly more detail than the Freedom of Information Act-could offer more than general guidelines for handling the kaleidoscopic factual prob- lems that will arise. Realistically viewed, however, the Information Act, perhaps unthinkingly, has partially resolved this conflict by establishing a statutory policy favoring disclosure of governmental records. In essence, it reverses the traditional presumption in favor of personal privacy, and places the burden on the information-hold- ing agency to find a specific statutory ground for refusing to honor a request for disclosure.396 In some instances the Act not only has shifted the burden of proof, it apparently has increased it as well. The most important statutory exemption from disclosure for pur- poses of the present discussion immunizes "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy."397 395. The fundamental conflict between these two objectives is perhaps best illus- trated by the following excerpt from Statement of President Johnson on Signing Public Law 89-487 (the Freedom of Information Act) on July 7, 1966, reprinted in UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE ANORNEY GENERAL S MEMORANDUM ON THE PUBLIC INFORMATION SECTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACr ii (1967) [here- inafter ATTORNEY GENERAL S MEMO]: A citizen must be able in confidence to complain to his Government and to provide information .... Fairness to individuals also requires that information accumulated in personnel files be protected from disclosure .... . . . . I have always believed that freedom of information is so vital that only the national security, not the desire of public officials or private citizens, should deter- mine when it must be restricted. 396. The Act "does not authorize withholding of information . . . except as specif- ically stated') in nine exceptions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(c) (Supp. III, 1965-1967). See Benson v.

Professor Davis, supra note 394, at 798, has argued with considerable logic that this provision forces the government official who has custody of a requested document to commit "an invasion of personal privacy</page><page sequence="107">April 1 969] Computers and Privacy  1195 The Information Act also has greatly expanded the class of per- sons who can compel disclosure398 by conferring standing on "any person,"399 a standard that one commentator suggests may preclude the courts from attempting to strike a balance between the privacy interests threatened on the one hand, and the importance of access to the information on the other.400 Although the Act permits anyone to compel disclosure judicially, it does not provide standing or assure notice, either of a request for information from an agency or of a judicial proceeding to compel an agency to honor a request, to the party whose interest is most clearly in jeopardy when disclosure of personal information is sought the individual who is the subject of the data.40l It is doubtful that reliance on bureaucratic inertia, and it even requires an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy so long as it is not 'clearly unwarranted."' Perhaps this is one situation in which the triumph of bureau- cratic inertia over nice legalistic distinctions will prove beneScial. It is hard to imagine a low-level bureaucrat engaging in the type of sophisticated analysis suggested by Professor Davis. However, it also is disturbing to remember that these same officials will be making the initial determination of whether or not release of a given docu- ment constitutes an invasion of privacy a question that few legal scholars would analyze the same way. But again Professor Davis: "The terms 'personnel and medical files,' 'similar files,' and 'clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy' are all reasonably clear standards ...." Id. 398. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3) (Supp. III, 1965-1967) grants the federal district courts jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding records or to order the production of records withheld. An action brought under this section is to take precedence on the docket over all matters except those the court considers to be of greater importance. 399. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3) (Supp. III, 1965-1967); see Skolnick v. Parsons, 397 F.2d 523 (7th Cir. 1968). 400. Davis, supra note 394, at 765-66. See also Recent Statute, 80 HARV. L. REV. 909, 911 (1967): [A]gency records will be equally available to litigants, newspapers, and officious inquirers, unless the courts interpret "any person" restrictively to mean "any per- son with a legitimate interest." Such an interpretation arguably would actually help to expand the area of publicly available information, on the theory that if information were equally available to any person, the courts would hesitate to order disclosure of information to persons with a particularly strong need because the same or similar information would have to be made available to everyone. However, the purpose of the Act, as shown by the legislative history, would seem to preclude such an interpretation of "any person." Notwithstanding the legislative history, the ATroRNEY GENERAL s MEMO 28 concludes that a restrictive reading of "any person" is defensible. According to the Memorandum, the district court in a trial de novo under the Act can "exercise the traditioIlal discre- tion of a court of equity" and weigh factors such as "the purposes and needs of the plaintifl, the burdens involved, and the importance to the public interest of the Government's reason for nondisclosure." Another route to the same result is a variable interpretation of the standard "clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy" described in note 397 sllpra and accompanying text: "Some regulations . . . provid[e] that the exemption will not apply to disclosures to certain classes of persons, on the assump- tion that release to such persons either would not be an invasion of privacy or would be justified by some public interest."

A statutory scheme that ignores a supposedly basic societal norm such as the right to privacy by requiring a demonstration that disclosure "would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of pri vacy" and then fails to provide a mechanism for giving notice to the person most interested in discharging that burden gives the impres sion of having been sketched by a surrealistic draftsman. Because the Information Act may have a drastic impact on pre- vailing standards of privacy, the scope of the exceptions permitting information to be withheld is crucial. Unfortunately, the language of these provisions ranges from the obscure to the opaque, and has moved Professor Kenneth Culp Davis to proclaim that the Act is "a shabby product indeed."402 The statute is not even consistent in describing the units of information that may be withheld. The introductory sentence in the exemption section provides that the subdivisions are inapplicable to "matters,"403 which would seem to indicate that the agencies are able to withhold individual items of information. This interpretation also appears consistent with the discretionary power to delete identifying details, which is given earlier in the Act.404 Yet, several of the most significant exceptions are phrased in terms of "files," "memorandums," or "letters," so that it is possible to read the statute as exempting the release of all infor- mation in a given "file" if it fits the statutory categorization.405 These constructions are conjectural, however, and the inescapable conclu- sion is that it is not clear whether the statutory exemptions apply to individual bits of information, specific documents, or entire files, or the possibility that the party whose privacy was threatened by disclosure might be able to intervene in the action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24. However, it is conceivable that the threat to privacy would be sufficient to confer that right. According to rule 24(a)(2), the test is whether or not "the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest ...." The real problem, of course, is lack of notice to the party whose personal data is being sought. Even when the agency refuses to release the data and is made the defendant in a court proceeding, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3) (Supp. III, 1965-1967) provides that the action shall "take precedence on the docket over all other causes," and hence the data subject is quite likely to be presented with a fait accompli. 402.

These interpretive difficulties are compounded in the context of computerized records. Of what relevance are words such as "files," "memorandums," "letters," and "matters," when the storage me- dium is a stack of tabulating cards, a reel of magnetic tape, or a disc? Does the Act envision the turning over of a tape or permitting the requesting party to duplicate it? If either is the case, it might enable the recipient to subject the data to highly detailed computer analysis that would reveal relationships and permit the drawing of inferences about people that would not be possible with less sophisticated methods. Another question is whether or not the Information Act obliges an agency to process all the data in its files on a given subject or to integrate its information with accessible data elsewhere within the Government. Is it possible that a person requesting disclosure of the data available on someone else has a right to have that data collated from the far reaches of the federal information system and printed out for him in dossier styleP406 Perhaps the most confusing statutory exemption deals with "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,"407 a provision which, as the Sttorney General's Memorandum on the Act admits, is "sus- ceptible of several readings, none of which is entirely satisfactory."408 Even the legislative history of this section is less than pellucid, but it seems to indicate that Congress intended to exempt all privileged information, trade secrets, and information obtained by the govern- ment under a pledge or reasonable expectation of confidentiality.409 406. The rather arbitrary interpretations advanced by the Attorney General's Memorandum do little to alleviate the confusion. For example, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (Supp. III, 1965-1967) exempts "matters that are . . . personnel and medical files and similar Ales the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" (emphasis added). The Memorandum concludes that this language encompasses all material contained in personnel and medical files, and "all private or personal information contained in other files which, if disclosed to the public, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of . . . privacy." ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MEMO 36 (emphasis added). The courts seem reluctant to impose any significant burden of search on the agencies; see, e.g., Bristol Meyers Co. v. iTG, 284 F.

This construction of the exemption also creates an intriguing di- lemma. It is supported by the notion that if personal information that has been extracted under a pledge of confidentiality is not exempted from disclosure under the Information Act, the citizen's trust in the Government will have been betrayed. The fear, of course, is that people will be deterred from furnishing candid or voluntary reports in the future. On the other hand, if each agency's pledge of confidentiality is honored, then each may be able to im- munize many of its records and activities from public scrutiny by the simple expedient of pledging confidentiality for all information gathered from the public.4l1 Since the Freedom of Information Act has so many theoretical and linguistic shortcomings, the manner in which the Act is admin- istered by the agencies will determine how the conflict between the individual's right to privacy and the public's need to know is re- solved.412 Although it is too early to make a confident assessment of It would . . . include information customarily subject to the doctor-patient, lawyer- client, lender-borrower, and other such privileges."

Apparently, many of the agencies affected by the Act are developing regulations for administrative appeals from initial deci- sions refusing disclosure.4l3 This procedure should bring the hard cases before a relatively high-level official who is more likely to be attuned to the privacy implications of disclosure than is the custodian of the document. These administrators also are less likely to be pressured into releasing the requested data by the threat of litiga- tion. Of course, the Act's goal of rapid and easy disclosure might be defeated by interjecting an administrative appeal that must be ex- hausted before the judicial remedy becomes available. This certainly would be true if ministerial personnel adopt a general policy of "bucking it upstairs" whenever confronted with a request for dis- closure. However, the reported cases thus far indicate that the prin- cipal users of the Information Act are not the representatives of the mass media,4l4 who had lobbied for its enactment,4l5 but private litigants invoking the Act as a supplement to the discovery rules,4ls parties threatened by administrative action,4l7 and companies inter- ested in contracting with the Government.4l8 In these situations, at least, it does not seem that the public's need to know will suffer un- duly if administrators proceed with caution and err on the side of * - protectlng prlvacy. Although agency regulations along these lines will help, they cannot overcome all of the linguistic and philosophical inharmony between the Freedom of Information Act and the needs of individ- ual privacy in the computer age.

In the event a National Data Center with interfaces with state, local, and private centers is established, the potential applications of the Act stagger the mind. This problem has yet to be subjected to a rational analysis. Also unnoticed thus far is the nexus between the Informa- tion Act and the Supreme Court's decision in Hill.419 Considering the two in tandem, the Freedom of Information Act gives the public in general and the mass communications media in particular a statutory right of access to a large segment of the constantly expand- ing and deepening store of personal information held by the fed- eral government, and Hill may permit the cavalier use of this data by the mass communications media by presaging the elimination of the restraint of any duty of reasonable care in a broad range of situations. The juxtaposition of the Act and a broad judicial con- ception of the first amendment is likely to have startling and sig- nificant effects. E. Information in Transit- Wiretapping and the Crime Control Act As a result of the enactment of title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968,42° the nation's law enforcement officers now have extensive statutory authority to intercept commu- nications.42l Despite its recent enactment and the insights that devel- oped out of the contemporaneous public debate over the National Data Center, the Crime Control Act in many ways is a technological anachronism. Even though a substantial and rapidly increasing pro- portion of the transmissions carried by the nation's communications networks involve data in digital form,422 the Act is framed almost 419. See text accompanying notes 280-89 supra. 420. 82 Stat. l97 (1968) [hereinafter Act]. Ironically, large portions of title III of the Act were taken from the proposed Right of Privacy Act of 1967, S. 928, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), which led one senator to observe: "Title III, in the form proposed by the administration as S. 928, was properly described as the Right to Privacy Act. As accepted by the committee [and ultimately enacted], Title III is more appropriately described as the End to Privacy Act." S. REP. No. 109T, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 182 (1968) [hereinafter S. REP.

At worst the Crime Control Act may be construed to permit privacy-invading interceptions that apparently were not contemplated by its drafts- men. Much of the interpretive difficulty stems from the fact that the Act does not define "communications." However, numerous cases decided under section 605 of the Communications Act,424 many of which are referred to in the legislative history of title III of the Crime Control Act, indicate that the term may apply only to transmissions of information from one person to another.425 Thus, the term might not extend to eavesdropping on machine responses to a remote user's inquiry or to the direct transfer of data from one computer to another.426 This construction would leave data communications without the protections against wiretapping that are embodied in the federal act; there would be protection only to the extent that Telephone and Telegraph Company has predicted that it will not be long until the volume of information calTied by data communication will exceed that carried by voice transmissions. UNIVAC Brief at H&amp;I-3 to H&amp;I-5. 423. An excellent example is the definition of "intercept" given in section 2510(4) of the Act: "the aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any . . . device" (emphasis added). Unless the word "aural" is given a strained construction, the Act does not seem to be applicable to a tap of the communications lines of a time-sharing system when the tap is linked to another com- puter that will print out the intercepted data or display it visually. The absurdity of such a result is emphasized by the fact that some computers are able to respond orally. The IBM 7770 Audio Response Unit, for example, "allows the computer to give oral answers to questions by use of a pre-recorded vocabulary." International Business Machines Co. news release, June 29, 1967. The quality and use of this oral response capability undoubtedly will increase. 424. 47 U.S.C. § 605 (1964).

Common sense undoubtedly will prevent a horse-and-buggy con- struction of the Crime Control Act and the courts can be expected to extend its terms to data transmissions. But this may be easier said than done in several contexts. Significant and troublesome problems will arise in connection with the Act's grant of authority to eaves- drop on a transmission when one of the parties to the communica- tion gives his consent.429 It is unclear who the "parties" to a com- puter transmission are, particularly in the case of a time-sharing system in which a user may have access to data deposited by some but not necessarily all of the other users. The provision at least sug- gests that an authorized user may permit law enforcement officials to gain access to any part of the computer's memory bank that is acces- sible through his terminal. But who are the "parties" when the com- munication simply involves a machine-to-machine transfer of infor- mation? Another source of difficulty is the section of the Act allowing eavesdropping on an "extension telephone."430 This provision has broader application than the reference to that mundane instrumen- tality would suggest because the term encompasses all equipment "furnished to the subscriber or user by a communications common carrier . . . and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business.''43l Thus, if the input-output devices of a remote-access computer system, such as the increasingly common touch-tone telephone, are supplied by the telephone company a situation that is not unlikely in view of the extensive control that the communications carriers have over the equipment that can be linked to their network432 police access to one carrier-owned output 427. The conflict between state and federal wiretapping laws has long been a difficult problem. See, e.g., Lee v. Florida, 392 U.S. 378 (1968); Pugach v.

Nor is there any doubt that police forces will be in a position to take advantage of any permissive construction the courts may give to the Act. As noted earlier,434 the telephone companies are beginning to convert voice transmissions from analog to digital form, which means that the law enforcement agencies will need to have the equip- . * . . - * . * * - ment and expertlse necessary to lntercept dlgltal communlcatlons ln order to carry on traditional tapping activities. Title III of the Crime Control Act, as is true of many federal statutes governing information transfers,435 provides only a narrow grant of standing to protest the illicit acquisition of personal infor- mation. The remedy of suppressing illegally seized eavesdropping evidence436 extends only to an "aggrieved person," a term that is de- fined as "a party to any intercepted . . . communication or a person against whom the interception was directed."437 The first portion of the quoted clause again requires a construction of the word "party." According to the legislative history of the passage, the provision will not safeguard a person who was the subject of arl illegally seized communication that originates or terminates at a computer data center containing individualized personal information.438 The sec- tion authorizing civil damages makes this limitation even clearer, stating that the remedy is available only to a person "whose wire or oral communication is intercepted, disclosed, or used" in violation of the Act.439 Denying a remedy to the party who is most affected by disclosure is objectionable when normal telephone conversations are in- Tel.

However, it seems clear that the communica- tions carriers will still supply a substantial number of the devices used in data transmissions. 433. One example of an essential carrier-supplied communications device which may be vulnerable to eavesdropping is described in IBM Brief I-69: "A rnodem (modulation/demodulation device) is generally required to convert data signals into a form suitable for transmission. Since modems are inclllded within the foreign avttach- ment provisions, they must be furnished by the carriers if they are to be used with a public exchange service." 434.

A distinction between voice and data communication for standing purposes might be drawn in terms of their qualitative difference442 and the system operator's relative lack of interest in protecting the data subject, his allegiance being to the system user. Inasmuch as the Crime Control Act's limitation on standing is based on the desire to minimize the exclusion of reliable evidence in criminal cases,443 it should not be extended to civil liti- gation especially damage actions to remedy improper interception and use of data communications. Of course, in the unlikely event that the operative passages of the Act are construed to apply only to person-to-person communications, then the individual who is the sub- ject of intercepted data might not be barred by the statutory limita- tions on standing. This would afford little succor to the data subject, however, since the cases involving standing to protest against wvire- tapping and eavesdropping in a situation not governed by statute have been extremely restrictive.444 The legislative history of the second portion of the standing clause "person against whom the interception was directed"-is rather sparse,445 but a reference to Jones v. United StAtes446 indicates that it probably was taken from the following passage in the opinion in that case: 440. See Schwartz, supra note 421, at 484-86. 441. See, e.g., notes 104, 228 supra and accompanying text 442. See text accompanying notes 450-52 infra. 443. See On Lee v.

United States, 37 U.S.L.W. 4189 (March 10, 1969), the Supreme Court held that under the fourth amendment a party who was merely the subject of an illegally seized conversation does not have standing to suppress evidence taken from the illegal interception. 445. S. REP. No. 1097, at 91, merely states that the language "is intended to reflect existing law" and cites several cases. 446. 362 U.S. 257 (1960). The legislative history also cites Mancusi v. De Forte, 392 U.S. 364 (1968), which the Supreme Court had not decided when the Senate Report was written. In Mancusi, the Supreme Court held that since the papers seized at the petitioner's office were the property of his employer, his claim of standing to suppress the fruits of the search would have to be based on the language of the fourth amend- ment proclaiming the "right of the people to be secure in their . . . houses." 392 U.S. at 367. The court then cited Jones and concluded that the "capacity to claim the pro- tection of the Amendment depends not upon a property right in the invaded place but upon whether the area was one in which there was a reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion." 392 U.S. at 368.</page><page sequence="117">April 1969] Computers and Privacy 1205 In order to qualify as a "person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure" one must have been a victim of a search and seizure, one against whom the search was directed, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gath- ered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else.... The restrictions upon searches and seizures were obviously designed for protection against oEcial invasion of privacy and the security of property. They are not exclusionary provisions against the admission of kinds of evidence deemed inherently unreliable or prejudicial. The exclusion in federal trials of evidence otherwise competent but gathered by federal oEcials in violation of the Fourth Amendment is a means for making effective the protection of pri- vacy.447 The Supreme Court's language seems to give standing to anyone who has been the victim of an invasion of privacy, which, if carried over to the Crime Control Act, would afford the data subject an oppor- tunity to vindicate his rights. Although Justice Fortas construed the Jones passage in this fashion in his dissenting opinion in Alderman v. United StAtes,448 a majority of the Court took a constrictive view of its earlier language in Jones; they limited standing to those who were parties to the conversation and those with a special interest in the premises on which the violation took place.449 Since the decisiorl in Alderman followed the enactment of the Crime Control Act, that case's reconstruction of the Jones language does not necessarily fur- nish the standard for interpreting the words "person against whom the interception was directed." Obviously, however, there is every likelihood that the federal courts will adhere to the Supreme Court's narrow view of standing, although a distinction between voice and data interceptions should be urged. The preceding discussion admittedly is highly episodic and super- ficial. The newness of the legislative scheme and the uncertain move- ments of the technology caution against more than a tentative pre- sentation at this time.

Such a person is surely "the victim of an invasion of privacy" and a "person aggrieved," even though it is not his property that was searched or seized....

This failure to differentiate between types of communications dis- plays either a lack of awareness of recent developments in commu- nications or a degree of disingenuousness on the part of the drafts- men. Given the preoccupation with voice communication at the time the legislation was enacted, its imprecise language probably is attributable to the former. The differences between voice and data communications are marked. Days of continuous wiretapping450 may be necessary to ob tain a significant amount of information from telephone conversa- tions, and even then the "evidence" often will consist of soft, hear- say narratives. Unlike the normal telephone flow, however, a data communications circuit may be in virtually continuous high-speed operation, transmitting extensive bodies of information that have been purged of trivial or extraneous matter and contain a high de- gree of hard, record data.45l In many instances this information wvill have been extracted under the coercive force of a crimina] statute, a governmental ukase, or as a precondition of receiving some social or financial benefit. Data transmissions also are more likely than tele- phone conversations to contain privileged or confidential data. These differences in character between wiretapping on voice com- munications and data comrnunications in turn are dvarfed by the possibility of law officers using dial-access devices to extract data directly from a variety of public and private computer centers and networks. If the Crime Control Act is construed to permit tlle seizure of vast quantities of computerized information on the basis of routine ex parte applications452 withotlt affording any mode of redress to the data subject-a major battle in the struggle to preserve individual privacy will have been lost. Rather than subjecting the field of electronic data transmission to the gauntlet of judicial con- struction of the inapposite language of the present Act, fresh legis- lative consideration of the subject seems desirable. 450.

The fragmented, ad hoc approach that has been taken to informational privacy problems is disheartening, for it simply aggravates the exist- ing system's unsuitability for solving the problems raised by the com- puter. The result is confusion concerning the scope of protection afforded by various common-law doctrines and legislative provisions, and, quite firequently, uncertainty regarding the source of law ap- plicable to a particular invasion of privacy. Moreover, isolated public responses to individual threats-as exemplified by the debate over the proposed National Data Center may draw an undue amount of attention. With public concern focused on relatively narrow problems, there is a substantial risk that many legitimate social interests relating to privacy and the free dissemination of in- formation will be ignored or left to the mercies of interested admin- istrators. As argued at an earlier stage of this Article,453 a broad con- ceptual framework is necessary to achieve a rational balance between the often competing objectives of preserving personal privacy and maximizing the benefits of efficiency inhering in the new technol- ogies. In order to come to grips wvith this task more effectively, it is desirable to consider the range of privacy-prcatecting safeguards that are technologically and practically feasible for use in conjunction with a modern information system. A. Technological Methods of Protection- The Quest for Security The problem of insuring the physical security of computerized information thus far has received little more than passing mention in most commentaries,464 even though improvements in security methods are a prerequisite to the effective use of several types of large multiple-access systems.455 In point of fact, a variety of mechan- 453.

Since many security devices and procedures of varying cost, com- plexity, and effectiveness may be available, the choice of an appro- priate protective system will depend upon a prior determination of how much storage and transmission security the particular data base deserves and who should be allowed access to it. This often will be a diflicult task, not only because opinions on the subject will diverge but also because information of differing degrees of sensitivity usu- ally will be stored in the same complex system and various groups of people will have to be able to reach different parts of the data.456 In addition, it often will be hard to perceive the nature and dimen- sion of future challenges to security since there will be changes in the character of the information and its attractiveness to snoopers over time. If the data stored in a given system is deemed sensitive enough to create a credible threat of eavesdropping on radiations from the equipment, the physical surroundings of the central processor and the remote terminals probably can be protected with shielding ma- terials.457 A related technique might be desirable for the stored data as well.458 In the case of remote-access systems, protection against wiretapping can be achieved by using "scramblers" to garble the data before transmission, and installing complementary devices in the authorized terminals to reconstitute the signal.459 If scrambling or tem users" and "[p]erfecting security protection systems and devices for preventing accidental or fraudulent transactions."

At least one other approach is available to meet the problem of preserving the integrity of the data by controlling access to certain portions of the files. In many cases this can be accomplished by stor- ing the data hierarchically on the basis of its level of content sensi- tivity. To a degree, this type of protection can be built into the hard- ware and software of the central processor. The working storage of a time-sharing system can be "partitioned" so that each user's "worker programs" have access only to a limited area of the com- puter's memory.46l To support this procedure, the monitor or con- trol program can be designed with a series of "privileged instruc- tions" that provide the only possible means of altering the monitor program.462 If any user's worker program attempts to alter the mon- itor program and invade a portion of the memory that is "off limits" to it, the monitor progwam can inform the system's supervisory per- sonnel and shut down the offending terminal.463 The effectiveness of this procedure can be tested by periodically checking a master copy of the monitor program against the one that is in operation in order to detect any alterations.464 The monitor program's efficacy in pro- tecting against unauthorized disclosure can be verified further by using a diagnostic program designed to make periodic attempts to deceive the monitor.465 The monitor program also can be designed Brief at J-22: "This kind of protection can be provided in several degrees ranging from quite simple, which an expert would not find difficult to decipher, to the almost un- breakable." 460. It may not be worth the effort or expense to develop completely break-proof codes. Sufficient scrambling or coding to make it uneconomic for an eavesdropper to attempt to intercept computer transmissions probably is enough. Alternatively, if information is arranged and stored on a hierarchical basis according to sensitivity or accessibility, the most efficient procedure may be to use codes of different degrees of complexity.

One workable method of identifying terminals is a "call-back" system, which re- quires a user at a remote console to key in a terminal identiScation code as a precondition to entering any of the files. rhe computer then shuts down the terminal, checks its files to see if the code num- ber is correct,467 and reopens the terminal if everything is in order.468 Presumably this function could be performed automatically by building a device into the terminal that would emit a unique identi- fying signal as a preface to each communication. Call-back systems have their limitations, however. A security system based upon the identification of terminals determines only whether or not the terminal is an authorized member of the system; it provides no assurance that the person at the terminal's console has a right to be there. Nor does a call-back system necessarily incorpo- rate guidarlce as to what portion of the files that particular termi- nal should be given access. There is no doubt that a greater degree of security is achieved by a system that decides whether to grant or deny access on the basis of user, rather than terminal, identification. Unfortunately, the problems of constructing an effective system of this type are quite extensive. Magnetically coded identification car{Is, even those designed to receive new invisible magnetic code numbers after each transmis- sion,469 can be lost, stolen, or transferred, as can a code number that is assigned to each user. These schemes not only are vulnerable to the risk that people will enter the system who have no authorization whatsoever, but they also can be compromised by the exchange of cards and numbers by authorized personnel when the access keys open up different portions of the data store or allow different users to reach different information nodes on a network. "Fail-safe" sys- tems, which require several users to insert their keys in a terminal be- fore certain files will be made available,470 will provide greater secu- 466. IBM Brief at I-68 to I-69. 467.

Another possibility is closed-circuit television between the terminal and the central processor permitting visual identification of the user,47l but this would be a relatively costly and cumbersome procedure. In the long run, the most promising method of assuring accurate user iden- tification may be automatic scanning of fingerprints or voiceprints; however, this is not technically feasible at the present time.472 Per- fection of this technique perhaps coupled with an "answer-back" system that requires the user to respond to a request to input some additional unpredictable identifying data in order to preclude the use of a record of another user's identifying input473 would provide a high degree of security. Whatever technical safeguards are deemed appropriate for par- ticular computer systems, they undoubtedly will be most efficient and economical if they are incorporated into the original design of the hardware and software than if they are added subsequently.474 In many cases, however, this is not being done currently, and it prob- ably will not be done in the near future unless computer manufac- turers and users begin to think systematically about problems of privacy.

Administrative Methods of Improving Security Technical safeguards for a computer system must be supported by a series of workable procedural controls designed to prevent care- less or intrusive personnel from bypassing the security devices. These administrative rules must be comprehensible to all personnel who have access to the system and they should be accompanied by realistic penalties. In short, administrative procedures are a necessary part of an over-all "protective philosophy," but they will prove effective only if they are understood by all people connected with the sys- tem;476 the willingness to abide by these regulations should be a basic attribute of personnel selected to work in the system. Only careful employment practices and gentle indoctrination can develop a cadre of systems operators who are sensitive to privacy considerations. A log listing every user of the data, the files he examined, and all significant events that take place within the central processor should be maintained.477 This log can be kept either by the operator of the central processer, by the machine itself, or by both.478 It should be audited periodically by security experts for signs of abuse and in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the entire protection program. Individuals whose personal data is stored in a system should have access to the audit from time to time. They should also, as has been suggested, have access to the data itself, so that they can retain a modicum of control over both the dissemination and the accuracy of the stored information relating to them.479 The cost of granting access for these purposes is certain to be substantial, particularly if the system is obliged to mail printouts to everyone on whom it main- tains data,480 although in the case of information maintained by the Government, the printout could be included in one of the periodic communications sent to most citizens. To the cost of giving indi- viduals notice of the contents of their files must be added the ex- pense of handling the flow of petty squabbles that might result from the procedure. Moreover, some loss in the value of certain types of data might result from its disclosure to the subject. Nonetheless, the right of an individual to be protected against governmental or pri- vate dissemination of erroneous or sensitive information about him 476.

Perhaps an appropriate compromise would be to inform individuals when their files are first opened, and then to designate particular times and places for them to examine their records, either in person or through remote terminals, and to lodge any protest they might have concerning inaccuracies or improper disseminations.48l Incon- venience and expense undoubtedly would prevent some people from taking advantage of this opportunity, but a relatively small number of successful challenges at least would serve to point out procedural and technical defects in the system's security and to sensitize its personnel to the privacy question. Computer experts seem to disagree on another important admin- istrative aspect of security: the question of whether or not the per- sonnel operating the central processor should have any detailed knowledge about the design of the monitor program. One school of thought argues that knowledge of the monitor program's intricacies should be limited to as small a group as possible. Under this scheme, the operators of the central processor never are told how the monitor program works, and the program's designers are prevented from gaining access to the monitor unless there is a need to make changes or improvements in it.482 The detractors of this approach belieare that it is desirable to have someone continuously on duty at the central processor who is thoroughly familiar with the security procedures and the principal weaknesses of the system.483 The suitability of either of these methods in a particular situation probably depends upon practical considerations such as the relative costs, the demon- strated dependability and faithfulness of the operating personnel, the sensitivity of the information in the system, and the degree to which the monitor program contains novel features that can best be protected by secrecy. Any system that contains sensitive data or data that for any reason is attractive to the snooping fraternity should be put under the aegis of personnel who are segTegated from those charged with the daily operation of the machines. This group should be trained in the philosophy and techniques of security, and occasionally should act as "devil's advocates" by trying to circumvent the existing pre- cautions in order to assess the system's security.484 This type of neutral force approach seems especially appropriate in the context 481.

C. Controls on Intut, Output, and Storage Perhaps the most critical set of regulations governing the opera- tion of data centers are those prescribing the information that may be included in or obtained from the system and the types of manip- ulations that may be performed on the data store. No technological or administrative security measures, however extensive they may be, can assure the complete integrity and privacy of the information con- tained in a given system. A computer's data store essentially is a file, and whatever has been placed in it can be extracted or altered.485 Thus, if informational privacy is to be protected, it is crucial to screen data initially to prevent some of it from being placed in the system. Extremely sensitive personal information for example, records of mental illness, or inherently "soft" data, such as psychological test results normally should be excluded from large multiaccess sys- tems,486 even if the files customarily are stored in a secure area re- moved from the central processor. Unless there is some definable and compelling reason to include this type of information in a multi- access system, every effort should be taken to keep it out of the infor- mation flow. When highly sensitive or potentially damaging infor- mation must be preserved, it should be subjected, as suggested earlier,487 to special storage and access procedures. In the case of any information of a sensitive character, each individual data subject should be told at the collection stage what uses are to be made of the data and what the extent and character of the group having access to it will be. Furthermore, all personal information that is put into a large computer system should have to meet rigid standards of accuracy 485. See Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 119 (testimony of Dr. Emanuel R. Piore, Vice President of International Business Machines Corp.); House Hearings on the Comp1lter and Invasion of Privacy 128 (testimony of Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation). 486. See generally Douglas, The Computerized Man, 33 VITAL SPEECHES 700 (1967). At least one bill has been proposed to Congress that would classify certain kinds of information as too sensitive to be collected by government agencies. S. 103S, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), would make it unlawful for federal administrative agencies to "require or request" from employees information concerning their race or national origin, participation in political organizations, religious or sexual beliefs and practices, and psychological test results. The bill does, however, provide numerous exceptions to these general prohibitions. 487. See pt. VII.

The scope of present efforts to standardize computer languages and data-collecting methods, which presently are intended to facilitate the movement of data among different systems, should be broadened to develop practices that would help alleviate the risks of misinterpretation inherent in transfers of personal data.489 Similarly, whenever possible, individ- uals should be given the right to supplement or explain personal in- formation that is likely to give rise to erroneous or damaging infer- ences.490 A significant percentage of personal information becomes more sensitive as it grows older and is forgotten by the general public; other data atrophies and becomes less important with the passage of time.49l For example, the record of an isolated past arrest may be extremely damaging if it is dredged up after the subject has made a fresh start, whereas many types of financial data pose less of a threat the more ancient they become. In short, the desirability of preserv- ing different types of recorded personal information should be re- evaluated continuously in light of privacy considerations. Computer- ized information must not be allowed to petrify. Data that is shown to be inaccurate, archaic, or of little probative value should be expunged, reclassified, or its age brought to the attention of users. Computer systems should establish a formal procedure for period- ically determining when data is outmoded or should be removed from the file for any of a number of other reasons. Since it is relatively simple to purge stale data from a computer system,492 regulations concerning the storage life of various types of 488.

Programming techniques also should be able to prevent the output of data that is damaging because it is incom- plete or has not been brought up to date. An arrest record, for exam- ple, always should be accompanied by data describing the disposition of the case, whether the party requesting the data asks for it or not. Other procedures for protecting anonymity can aid system de- signers in preserving the supposed distinction between statistical data centers and intelligence systems. In some cases, data can be put into the system in small aggregates rather than individualized units; thus, no single person's data could be traced with certainty.493 When it is essential to identify an individual for purposes of updating the data, some protection can be secured by assigning each respondent an arbitrary identifying number. The data then can be divided into a "substantive deck" for normal statistical use, which would contain the data along with the arbitrary numbers, and an "identifi- cation deck," which is needed to link the individual to his code number in order to make a new entry in his data.494 Modern sam- pling techniques also make it possible to reach statistically valid results without analyzing the data on every available respondent unit. Thus, it should be possible to deter snoopers by using a ran- dom sample selected to make it unlikely that a successful in- trusion will yield a dossier on a particular person.495 This procedure may not always be feasible. In multipurpose statistical centers such as the proposed National Data Center, the objective is to pro- vide one body of data that can be used for a wide variety of analytical projects. This means that the Center's underlying "sam- ple" would have to be large enough to contain data on tlle different variables needed by numerous researchers pursuing various proj- 493.

Managing the Information Managers Effective technical and procedural safeguards, combined with input-output controls, all are critical prerequisites to maintaining the privacy andl factual reliability of computerized information. But they are not sufficient by themselves. Even the most sophisticated set of safeguards can be undermined by the people who gain access to the system in one fashion or another.498 The reports of college students at MIT and elsewhere defeating the monitor protections in time-sharing projects emphasize the reality of this threat.499 It would be a mistake to believe that the risks to privacy created by computerization lie exclusively in the misuse of the system by malicious or profit-seeking interlopers. Those who live on intimate terms with the data bases and the technology may prove to be a more dangerous group, even though they may have no interest 496. Cf. Note, supra note 49S, at 413-14: To facilitate comparative analysis of particular variables, the samples tested for the variables would have to be identical. Where the samples are not identical, correlations of the variables are possible only on a global basis that is, by finding a third factor which correlates with each of two factors for which different samples have been tested, an analyst can make an indirect correlation between two factors in which he is interested. However, global comparisons constitute the very type of imprecise and unreliable analysis which the data center is intended to obviate. 497 See, e.g., Lozowick, Steiner, Sc Miller, Law and Quantitative Multivariate Anal- ysis: an Encounter, 66 MICH.

Thus, the technicians who design and operate computer systems cannot be treated as a Brahmin caste. They already perform many disparate roles, and in the future they are lileely to assume managerial func- tions that range far beyond their technical expertise. In addition to the mundane tasks of collating and disseminating data and oversee- ing machine operations, programmers and system operators un- doubtedly will be called upon to take part in the information anal- ysis and decision-making processes.500 In many instances this pattern will emerge because the volume atld variousness of the data will be too great, the methods of storing and manipulating the information too complex, and the technical language too arcane to enable scien- tifically na-;ve executives and public officials to maintain effective control over the structure and activities of their systems.

At this comparatively embryonic stage of the technology, it is doubtful that legislation or even admin- istrative regulation could provide a set of principles that would be adequate to govern the wide variety of situations in which computer personnel will be called upon to manipulate or analyze personal data.603 The inculcation of a sensitivity or professional commitment to the values of personal privacy and the dignity of the individual may provide a far more effective long-term check on the custodians of personal information. Moreover, it may be that the basic philo- sophical question-what are the duties and responsibilities of those who handle personal information affecting their fellow man-is as much an ethical dilemma as it is a legal issue. If so, perhaps it is best left for regulation by the practitioners of the art in the first in- stance.604 Unfortunately, there seem to be equally good reasons why the professionalization of computer personnel is an unrealistic solution to the privacy problem, at least at the present time. Computer pro- gramming and operation, system design and analysis, and most of the other occupations relating to the new technology are very young and rapidly expanding505 vocations that lack well-developed tradi- tions. It is questionable whether this atmosphere is congenial to effective self-regulation or the adoption of a code of ethics that almost 503. Cf. PRIVACY AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH 7: Legislation to assure appropriate recognition of the rights of human subjects [in behavioral science experiments] is neither necessary nor desirable if scientists and sponsoring institutions fully discharge their responsibilities in accommodating to the claim of privacy. Because of its relative inflexibility, legislation cannot meet the challenge of the subtle and sensitive conflict of values under consideration nor can it aid in the wise, individualized decisionmaking which is required to assure optimum protection of subjects together with the fullest effectiveness of research. 504. Cf. id. at 14: The values held by an individual or a society are, and must be, in competition since no single value can be absolute.... Thus the conflict between the claim of the individual to his privacy and the needs of society to become better aware of human characteristics is no rare or isolated phenomenon. In each instance of conflict, the decision must rest on the totality of all the relevant issues and the result will vary from one occasion to another, and from one setting to another depending on the context within which the issue arises.... No general rule can be formulated to apply in each situation .... 505. See, c.g., Hearings on Data Processing Management 149: [A National Science Foundation] survey found that 120,000 undergraduates and 29,000 graduate students received some computer training during 1964-65. In addi- tion, approximately 4,000 undergraduates and 1,300 graduate majors in "computer science" were estimated to have been enrolled in 1964-65. By 1968-69, it is esti- mated these enrollments for these majors will have inaeased fourfold.

Unlike the physician or lawyer, the computer operator does not deal directly with the people whose life histories he processes. The data subject is not present to engage his sympathies and serve as a reminder that the operator's conduct has an important impact on human beings. To the contrary, in most cases the immediate object of his sense of professional obligation is to the system that employs him, and he often ascribes anthropomorphic qualities to that system. Thus, he may Snd it difficult to visualize himself as the protector of an amorphous agglomeration of individuals whose computerized files happen to fall within his jurisdiction, and whose actual exis- tence may be evidenced only by a string of binary digits or a se- quence of magnetic impulses. Again, this environment is not con- ducive to enlightened self-restraint. Finally, it is possible that the emerging class of data managers is imbued with values that are fundamentally incompatible with a commitment to the preservation of individual privacy. According to this theory, computer designers and operators- as a subspecies of modern technological man are devoted to a scientific quest for efficiency, even if it comes at the expense of humanistic values; indi- viduals are viewed as little more than operating units that must be made to act predictably and function properly within a well- designed system.506 This judgment undoubtedly is too harsh and ignores the many knowledgeable and socially concerned people who have helped give birth to the new technology and who are advancing its growth today. But it is plausible enough to caution those respon- sible for establishing and enforcing public policy that they must exercise continuing vigilance over the information managers rather than abdicate responsibility to them. An alternative method of reducing the risks created by careless, insensitive, or dishonest personnel is to encourage those professions that are the beneSciaries of computerized data to develop ethical standards governing their own collection, use, and dissemination of personal information.507 Obviously, this method has certain inherent 506.

The computer is so flexible a device, and personal in- formation is employed for so many purposes, that comprehensive user self-regulation seems unrealistic, which means that this approach probably could reach only a relatively small proportion of potential abuses. Moreover, as suggested earlier,508 the most effective privacy protection scheme is one that minimizes the amount of potentially dangerous material that is collected and preserved; a regulatory scheme that focuses on the end use of the data by governmental or private systems might be a case of too little, too late. Uniformity also would be difiicult to achieve because of the diffuseness of the user groups. One suggested list of users includes "doctors, lawyers, ac- countants, journalists, sociologists, political scientists, historians and anthropologists."509 It seems doubtful that any two of these occupa- tions would have similar views on how much or what kinds of pro- tection an individual should have against misuse or widespread dis- semination of intimate personal facts. The professions, at least those listed above, also are likely to be primarily concerned with statistical analyses, and therefore any scheme that regulates them might leave the bulk of the intelligence or surveillance uses that are most inim- ical to personal privacy unregulated. Nor will all of these professional groups have the resources, technological experience, or motivation to develop and enforce privacy-protecting codes on their own initia- tive. If professional self-regulation is to have any meaningful impact, it seems necessary to provide some measure of central coordination and an overarching apparatus for channeling the benefits of current research and thinking on privacy to all user groups. Notwithstanding these difiiculties, professional self-regulation and self-examination undoubtedly will play an important role in the over-all protection scheme. If handled properly, the very lack of traditions or calcified attitudes among the current generation of computer specialists and the inherent diversity of outlook among different user groups might prove to be important assets in pre- serving individual privacy. But to capitalize on these conditions, the development of professional codes of ethics must be approached as an innovative and experimental process. Furthermore, self-regu- lation must be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, policy determinations by other interested societal institutions as to * * . * . approprlate mlnlmum eve s ot prlvacy protectlon. thus logical to expect that these professional associations . . . will accept the responsibility for establishing ethical principles and guidelines for conduct of research as one of their major purposes. 508.

THE SEARCH FOR A LEGAL FRAMEWORK Although the threat to personal privacy presented by the new information transfer technologies is substantial and imminent, the preceding section demonstrates that a number of workable technical and procedural safeguards are available and undoubtedly more can be developed if the appropriate private and governmental groups are given sufficient impetus to make the needed adjustments in practice. The central problem is to determine how the legal system can best insure that a proper balance is struck between the tradi- tional libertarian ideals embodied in the concept of privacy and the immense social beneSt that computer technology offers. This prob- lem is of a type that has many antecedents. Striking a balance be- tween democracy and technocracy has been a frequent chore in the past and the lawmakers should not shrink from the task. But the challenge of developing a meaningful level of protection in a computerized age is a formidable one and the law's past recor of dealing with emerging technologies is not entirely encouraging. Indeed, the legal system's reluctance to deal coherently and promptly with novel phenomena seems to have been greatest when innovation has occurred in the field of communications. In the past, the impor- tance and vulnerability of first amendment freedoms were ample reason for treating the information media with caution. But the computer's potential as an engine of social change- and human control indicates that a greater threat to freedom may lie in in- action or continued application of ancient or inapposite doctrine in the face of the growing power of information in contemporary life and the increasing concentration of control over it. As discussed above,510 the current patchwork of common-law remedies and statutory regulations is characterized by uncertain application, lack of predictability, frequent inconsistency, un- awareness of the ramifications of the new communications media, and an almost total disregard for the individual's right to participate in information transactions that have a profound impact on his life. It is unequal to the task at hand. Even if the common-law privacy remedies were rehabilitated and the constitutional freedoms of association and belief were expanded, it would be unwise to rely exclusively on private actions for damages, restitution, or injunctive relief to protect a citizen from misuse of personal information. The difiiculties and imprecision of converting a loss of privacy and re- lated injuries to an individual's personality into monetary damages 510. See pts.

Furthermore, is it even likely that an individual will discover that maligning or inaccurate infor- mation has been placed in his dossier or that an improper dissemi- nation of confidential matter has cost him a government position, denied him a promotion, or impaired his commercial, personal, or professional relations with others? The difficulty of finding an appropriate mode of relief is com- pounded by the protean character of the computer; it permeates both the public and private sectors and has ramifications that cut across the relevant traditional legal theories. Almost any doctrinal legal response is bound to seem Procrustean or anachronistic. Thus, although a number of ingenious modifications of the existing com- partmentalized legal structure have been proposed, no single theory promises to be expansive enough to respond effectively to the com- puter's multifaceted threat to individual privacy. A. Property Theories of Privacy Perhaps the most facile approach to safeguarding privacy is the suggestion that control over personal information be considered a property right, vested in the subject of the data and eligible for the full range of constitutional and legal protections that attach to property.5ll Support for this theory can be drawn from the fact that personal data often is treated as a commodity,5l2 as well as from 511. A. WESTIN, PRIVACY AND FREEDOM 324-25 (1967), concludes that "personal in- formation, thought of as the right of decision over one's private personality, should be defined as a property right, with all the restraints on interference by public or private authorities and due process guarantees that our law of property has been so skillful in devising." Unfortunately, the author does not offer any enlightenment concerning what he means by "property right." A more metaphysical approach to the same result is offered in Shils, Prizoacy and Power, reprinted in Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 231, 247: The "social space" around an individual, the recollection of his past, his conversa- tion, his body and its image, all belong to him.... He possesses them and is entitled to possess them by virtue of the charisma which is inherent in his exis- tance [sic] as an individual soul-as we say nowadays, in his individuality and which is inherent in his membership in the civil community. In contexts such as the sale of personal information by credit bureaus, however, it is not the subject of the data but a third party who is selling the data. Thus, recog- nition of a property right in the subject could not be justified on the theory that the law merely was acknowledging the realities of the marketplace. Moreover, prop- erty theory, like the defense of consent in privacy actions, is open to the objections that it is simply a conclusory label and places responsibility on the individual rather than on the organization that wants to use the data, and usually has the leverage to extract it. Credit bureaus, for example, would be no less able to "purchase" property rights than they are presently able to obtain "voluntary" consent to credit investiga- tions. See text accompanying notes 248, 315 supra. 512. It is true that a few courts have recognized property rights in the names and likenesses of celebrities for advertising purposes, but that situation is much more clearly an arm's length transaction, and is almost wholly devoid of traditional privacy</page><page sequence="136">1224 Michigan Law Resiew [Vol. 67:1089 analogies to recent decisions dealing with search and seizure5l3 and the holdings of a few privacy cases.5l4 The property theory is also the most direct method of resolving the problem of standing to sue and of eliminating the current ability to deal in the intimate de- tails of a person's life history without his knowledge or consent and with little likelihood of legal liability. The basic objection to granting a property right in personal in- formation for these purposes is the irrelevancy of property concepts to the values that privacy doctrine seeks to safeguard. The protec- tion of individual privacy is intended to preserve emotional and psychological tranquillity by remedying a damaging publication or dissemination, rather than to define the legal title to or control the exploitation of a commodity.5l5 There also are practical reasons to oppose the property rationale. The development of property rights in personal information probably would take place under state law. Yet experience with state-created property rights in literary works and commercial values indicates that confusion, uneven protection, and difficult conlSict-of-laws problems are certain to result if the considerations. See generally Haelen Laboratories, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 202 F.2d 866 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 816 (1953); Nimmer, The Right of Publicity, 19 LAW &amp; CONTEMP. PROB. 203 (1954). But cf. Miller v. Commissioner, 299 F.2d 706 (2d Cir. 1962), which demonstrates the range of potential absurdities that could result from treating personal information as property. 513. See notes 331-32 supre and accompanying text. But cf. Alderman v. United States, 37 U.S.L.W. 4189, 4201 (March 10, 1969) Uustice Harlan, concurring and dis- senting): "[T]he right to conversational privacy is a personal right, not a property right." 514. See, e.g., Zimmermann v. Wilson, 81 F.2d 847, 848 (3d Cir. 1936), in which an injunction was granted preventing revenue agents from examining bank accounts. The court rejected a contention that the bankers' acquiescence in the search precluded the taxpayers from seeking relief, stating: It is Zimmermann and his wife, and not their bankers and brokers, who are the real and aggrieved parties before us. To say that their bank accounts, withdrawals, their loans and collateral deposits, are the property of their bankers and brokers, and the taxpayers have no right or standing to prevent an unreasonable search thereof, is to lose sight of substance and rest on shadow.... The bankers and brokers have no interest in contesting the search . . . but, when the notice to produce is served on them, coupled as it is with the assertion that noncompliance with the order will subject [them to criminal penalties], prudence and regard for the banker's own alleged liability . . . all unite to constrain him . . . [to] give the government a searching power of the defendants' affairs which it cannot legally assert against the taxpayers themselves. See also Brex v. Smith, 146 A. 34, 36 (N.J. Ch. 1929): "There is an implied obliga- tion . . . on the bank, to keep [records of deposits and withdrawals] from scrutiny until compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction to do otherwise. The information contained in the records is certainly a property right." But cf. note 525 infra. 515. Cf. Warren &amp; Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 HARV. L.

Along the same lines, it is difficult to perceive how a common-law property theory would solve some of the problems raised by federal data centers. It would be ironic, indeed, if the law governing com- puter systems unwittingly followed the unsatisfactory pattern that the law of literary property is now struggling to escape.5l7 Finally, creation of property rights in personal information might prove to be too inlRexible a method of regulating the development of impor- tant phases of a technology that still is in its infancy and it might tend to abort attempts to pursue other avenues of legal control. Certainly the creation of a property right in information does not obviate the need to impose technological and procedural restraints on information handlers of the type previously described.5l8 The fact that a property theory of personal information would involve the recognition of rights in an inexhaustible commodity suggests that the enigmatic tort theory of misappropriation may be somewhat more adaptable to the problems of computerized data- processing than a conventional property right would be.5ls The leading case of International News Service v. Associated Press,620 which held the defendant liable for the pirating of wire service news reports prepared by a rival company, indicates that misappropri- ation is concerned primarily with the relationship of those who are competitors.

Misappropriation is an appealing theory because personal data can be viewed as the individual's "sweat of the brow," and arguably whatever value it has must be attributed to the subject's "capital and resources." It also recognizes that relations between particular people can give rise to different rights and liabilities in items of economic value. If that is true of competitors, as was the case in INS, there is no reason why it cannot also be true of information subjects on the one hand and information disseminators and users on the other. Moreover, misappropriation has sufficient doctrinal vagueness to accommodate a variety of different policy interests and factual situations.522 But, as in the case of traditional property theory, misappropriation has been used primarily to vindicate eco- nomic rather than emotional or personal values, and, as a creature of state law, it is subject to all of the confusion and inequality of application inherent in using an ad hoc approach to a very complex problem. B. Information Trusts and Privacy A more innovative legal approach than the recognition of a property right in information calls for the adaptation of a venerable legal device, the trust, to provide the mechanism for protecting 521. 248 U.S. at 236. See also the dissenting opinion of Justice Brandeis, 248 U.S. at 250: An essential element of individual property is the legal right to exclude others from enjoying it. If the property is private, the right of exclusion may be absolute; if the property is affected with a public interest, the right of exclusion is quali- fied.... There are ... many ... cases in which courts interfere to prevent curtailment of plaintiff's enjoyment of incorporeal productions, and in which the right to relief is often called a property right, but is such only in a special sense. In those cases, the plaintiff has no absolute right to the protection of his pro- duction; he has merely the qualified right to be protected as against the defen- dant's acts, because of the special relation in which the latter stands or the wrongful method or means employed in acquiring the knowledge or the manner in which it is used. 522.

This method currently is being tested by the United Planning Organi- zation (UPO), a body formed to establish a "Social Data File" that integrates information on the administration of a number of wel- fare programs. The UPO has computerized large bodies of personal information secured from various agencies in the District of Colum- bia and created a trust, treating the data as a res. Control over the data is vested in a number of independent trustees, whose actions are regulated by an elaborate agreement governing permissible disclosures.523 The existence of a watchdog group, which does not have an active interest in exploiting the data in its custody and is circum- scribed by clearly defined fiduciary duties, is appealing on its face. However, the trust device is not free from conceptual difficulties. It is a traditional principle that the subject matter of a trust must be a legally enforceable property interest,524 and the assumption that the UPO is the "owner" of the personal data embodied on the magnetic tapes and punch cards that constitute the trust res seems to be a major feat of question-begging. Much of the data undoubt- edly is public record information and incapable of being "owned" by anyone; the residue, if it is property at all, surely ought to be- long to the individual to whom it pertains rather than to a group that has possession of one notational version of it. The anomaly is emphasized by the fact that the information in question could be 523. The trust instrument is summarized as follows in Senate Hearings on Com- puter Privacy, pt. 2, at 310-11: The property that the UPO now has, data that we have received from public agencies and collected through some of our own programs, will be transferred to three persons who will serve as trustees for the data.... They will own and col- lect the data which constitute the trust estatc subject to the conditions which are specified in the Agreement. . . . The conditions that would be imposed are several. First, the trustees must hold the data only for a specified purpose. The Agree- ment describes this purpose as evaluation of social problems and agency practices in the District of Columbia .... This is an aggregate, statistical purpose which does not include evaluation of any individual. Second, the trustees must place the data in the custody of the UPO for its use as long as UPO exists and does not disclaim its right under the Agreement to have custody of the data.... Third, the trustees can only place the data in the custody of UPO . . . if we use it for the purpose described . . . and do not use it to breach the confidentiality of information collected concerning named individuals.... Although the recipient would be permitted to delegate research projects to other persons or organizations, it would be prohibited from placing data iden- tifying individuals by name in anyone else's custody .... Fourth, the trustees cannot transfer their control over the data.... Fifth, the trust is created in perpetuity and is irrevocable. For the full text of the agreement, see id. at 312-17.

Nor does it reach the data-collection phase of the information process, although it is possible to extend the trust concept to every aspect of information-handling. But this is an extremely clumsy and circuitous way of establishing a regula- tory scheme. A more philosophical objection to this approach stems from the question whether the law of trusts, which throughout its evolution has been designed primarily to safeguard the economic well-being of beneficiaries, is really the most suitable mechanism for creating and enforcing rules to protect the emotional tranquil- lity and community status of individuals. The trust concept also is suspect as a protector of privacy be- cause it is essentially an ex parte creation of the party controlling a particular data base, which means that the terms and conditions of the trust instrument are, within very broad limits, wholly a mat- ter of the discretion or benevolence of the party executing it. The United Planning Organization's trust agreement illustrates this de- ficiency very clearly, since it creates no enforceable rights in the parties who are, at least in theory, its beneficiaries-the citizens whose personal information has been collected by the governmental agencies that furnished the data.526 Apart from this problem, which could be ameliorated judicially, the trust approach has the poten- tial of resulting in an even greater lack of uniformity of treatment 525. Cf. Pearson v. Dodd, No. 21,910. at 11-12 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 24, 1969), in which plaintiff asserted that photocopying of documents from his files and unauthorized dissemination of the copies invaded his property rights. The court rejected the prop- erty theory: The question here is not whether appellee had a right to keep his files from prying eyes, but whether the information taken from those files falls under the protection of the law of property, enforceable by a suit for conversion. In our view, it does not.... Insofar as we can tell, none of it amounts to literary prop- erty, to scientific invention, or to secret plans formulated by appellee for the conduct of commerce. Nor does it appear to be information held in any way for sale by appellee, analogous to the fresh news copy produced by a wire service. . . . . Because no conversion of the physical contents of appellee's files took place, . . . the District Court's ruling that appellants are guilty of conversion must be reversed. 526. The trust provision by which the United Planning Organization, the donor- recipient, reserves the power to seek judicial enforcement of the terms of the agree- ment is set out in Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy, pt. 2, at 315.</page><page sequence="141">April 1969] Computers and Privacy 1229 than the property or misappropriation theories. And, given the conceptual difliculty of applying trust theories to computerized personal information, it seems likely that any judicial scrutiny of a trustee's behavior might degenerate into a highly convoluted doc- trinal analysis of trust law or a baroque construction of the language of the trust instrument. On balance, therefore, the establishment of personal information trusts may be more suited to providing full employment for lawyers than to fashioning a workable balance between the competing in- terests in the flow of personal information. Far from being a pan- acea, it is little more than a legalistic, ad hoc attempt to finesse the highly complex problems that should be dealt with directly by in- formation users. At the same time, the trust concept also obfuscates a number of the underlying policy issues. It is a useful expedient for providing a small measure of control over the manipulation of data by particular groups or data systems; in a sense, it is a first step toward creating a professional sensitivity to the value of personal privacy on the part of the information managers and UPO should be commended for developing it. But trust law is unlikely to be the seminal mechanism for solving the privacy problems of the com- puter age. C. Federal Privacy Legislation The computer's impact on traditional relationships between individuals and organizations, and the impending emergence of computer technology as a medium of communication with national * * s * &lt; * - dlmenslons, suggest that congresslonal actlon to protect prlvacy values may be both necessary and appropriate. By pre-empting in- consistent state laws and affording protection to individuals in con- texts in which none presently exists, Congress could provide a uniform and comprehensive formula for the development of multi- state computer systems and at the same time infuse a measure of coherence into the law of privacy. But the uncertain direction of the computer age and the lack of obvious and easy solutions have combined to make the desirability and effectiveness of congressional action still very much a matter of conjecture. A legislative solution can take a number of different forms. The simplest approach, and certainly an effective method of protecting against misuse of personal information, is to enact statutes prohibit- ing governmental, and perhaps even nongovernmental, organiza- tions from collecting designated classes of data or, at the least, prohibiting them from using or threatening formal or informal</page><page sequence="142">1230 Michigan Law Review [Vol. 67:1089 sanctions to coerce disclosure of the data. An example of this type of legislation is the series of recent bills that would eliminate the existing criminal penalties for failure to answer many of the ques- tions asked by the Census Bureau.527 Although the scope of the current decennial census ranges far beyond the periodic "enumer- ation" contemplated by the Constitution,528 Congress generally has passively acquiesced in administrative determinations of what in- formation should be collected by the Government. To be sure the national government has the power to proliferate the census process as a necessary and proper adjunct to the effective planning of nu- merous federal programs. But the increasingly elephantine char- acter of the census indicates that middle- and low-level bureaucrats often in response to pressures exerted by large industrial lobbies or other government administrators529-in effect are expanding the contours and the potential application of the criminal sanctions imposed for noncompliance with a census request by determining what questions will be included in it. As attractive as excision of the sanctions appears to be, other considerations counsel against hasty use of this legislative technique. Even a mild restriction such as removing the in terrorem effect of criminal penalties from the census process could have an adverse effect on the federal government's over-all statistical effort. If popu- lar resentment against the spectrum of contemporary privacy in- vasions and the never-ending stream of governmental and private questionnaires focuses on the census, removing the formal sanctions arguably might precipitate a widespread failure to respond that could impair the statistical validity of surveys that are urgently needed for the analysis of fundamental social problems. The hypo- thetical character of this observation must be emphasized. Although there is a division of opinion as to whether the elimination of the criminal penalties would skew the results of the census to any ap- 527. See note 347 supra. Over 100 congressmen have endorsed bills removing these penalties. CONG,. 115 REC. H858 (daily ed., Feb. 6, 1969).

The cozy relationship between the Census Bureau and Federal statistical users has gone beyond the semblance of public service. I believe this is an un- wholesome alliance which causes improper expansion of the collection of personal data under threat of fine or imprisonment.</page><page sequence="143">April 1969] Computers and Privacy 1231 preciable degree,630 it seems unlikely that a sizeable portion of the population would refuse to honor the census request. For some people the process of responding to interrogatories of this type has taken on a Pavlovian character and for others it simply is a matter of good citizenship. There also seems to be little doubt that more refined sampling techniques are available that would cure any prob- lem that might arise.531 In addition, elimination of the sanctions would not ameliorate the coercive "follow-up" practices of the Gov- ernment or the subtle forms of pressure that are at work when a citizen is asked to furnish information to his Government. A veteran receiving a pension is likely to complete a Defense Department questionnaire whether or not his obligation to do so can be en- forced by fine or imprisonment.532 But whatever the intrinsic merits of eliminating the census sanctions, prohibitions on coercive data collection can remedy only some of the more blatant affronts to individual privacy. Most of the dangers of the computer age are far more subtle. The task of developing legislative safegllards to maintain the privacy of data is more difficult in cases in which the information may be used for varied purposes or must be made available to cer- tain agencies or groups but withheld from any wider circulation than it is when all dissemination can be proscribed. Part of the problem stems from the chameleon-like character of many types of data. As congressional investigations of the proposed National Data Center revealed, the "sensitivity" of information its potential ability to harm the individual if inaccurate or if improperly dis- seminated-depends in large measure upon the context in which it was first given, and the context in which it is later used.533 It will be a rare information system in which all of the data has a uniform level of sensitivity. As indicated earlier,634 access regulations, personnel controls, and machine safeguards all are available to develop privacy-pro- tecting systems that can discriminate among different users and differentiate data on the basis of sensitivity. But these techniques 530. This point was discussed by several of the witnesses before the Senate Sub- committee on Constitutional Rights during its hearings on S. 1791 in April 1969.

Thus, legislation dealing with one aspect of security or one level of sensitivity will not effectively preserve privacy. It seems obvious that a potpourri of legislative controls will be needed; some would establish varying degrees of confidentiality for different kinds of data and others would prescribe the technical and procedural safeguards to be em- ployed by the system, with the safeguards organized hierarchically in terms of different levels of data sensitivity. This type of refined structuring presumably would be predicated on an evaluation of how much "privacy" the data in a given system deserves and a bal- ancing of the damage that can be caused by misuse of the informa- tion against the cost and loss of efficiency that would result from implementing various safeguards. This assessment takes on an over- whelmingly complex demeanor if it has to be made in the context of a highly sophisticated network or system that involves data from numerous sources and is used by discrete people, groups, agencies, and organizations for highly disparate purposes. Since the myriad facets of the privacy problem would be difficult to resolve legislatively even if only a single computer system con- taining personal information required regulation, it seems unlikely that a single statutory scheme can deal effectively with all computer systems. The limited present experience with data centers and net- works and the enormously complex problems of distinguishing be- tween governmental and private systems and determining the extent to which the latter should be federally regulated make the obstacles to drafting comprehensive national legislation virtually insur- mountable at the present. A less ambitious course may be appropriate, however. Perhaps it is not necessary for federal legislation to grapple with the minutiae of the specific methods of protection to be followed by every con- ceivable computer system. It has been asserted that the Freedom of Information Act is effecting a substantial relaxation of government secrecy even though it hardly could be called a model of clarity or speciScity.535 Since protection of informational privacy always will depend in some measure upon the discretion of the data managers, it may be sufficient to adopt an approach similar to that of the In- formation Act by providing a set of general legislative guidelines and a philosophical orientation that will encourage the enlightened exercise of that discretion. But there are several reasons why the Freedom of Information Act is not entirely apposite as a model for federal privacy legislation. 535. See text accompanying notes 394-419 supra.</page><page sequence="145">April 1969] Computers and Privacy 1233 To be effective, an informational privacy statute should be as ex- tensive as the applications of computer technology, embracing, at least to some degree, both public and private data centers and taking cognizance of the interactions of these systems. The scope of the Freedom of Information Act, however, is much more limited in the sense that it deals with the disclosure obligations of the individual federal agencies-bodies that at least have similarities of structure and function, and share a basic commitment to the ideals of public service. Moreover, the Information Act attempts to avoid conflicts with other legislation by explicitly deferring to existing restrictions on disclosure.536 Any attempt at effective privacy legislation should strive to bring some order to the existing welter of conflicting and often meaningless confidentiality statutes, which might necessitate supersession or modification of some aspects of other federal legis- lation, such as the Federal Reports Act, the Crime Control Act, and the Information Act itself. Finally, the Freedom of Information Act deals with familiar problems and was built upon a history of prior legislation and well-defined administrative practice. Computer tech- nology is essentially a new medium of communication, and, in spite of the recent profusion of books and articles on the subject, very little really is known about its long-range impact on the fabric of our society. In view of the manifold difficulties of drafting comprehensive privacy legislation, especially in the context of computerized infor- mation, it is not surprising that most of the bills that have been introduced in the ninetieth and ninety-first Congresses relating to the subject have had relatively narrow scopes.537 As mentioned earlier, some of these proposals deal with the information-handling activi- ties of particular agencies, such as the Census Bureau.538 Other proposals involve attempts to protect certain groups that are vul- nerable to privacy invasions; this is true of Senator Ervin's bill re- lating to government employees.539 On both the federal and state levels, there has been a flurry of legislative activity in the credit bureau field.540 In one of the most ambitious efforts to date, Congressman Koch has introduced a bill which would amend the Freedom of Informa- 536. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3) (Supp. III, 1965-1967). 537.

There is no doubt that the enactment and enforcement of this bill would have a substantial ameliorative effect on the present information-handling practices of a number of federal agencies; but it would accomplish little on the information-gathering side of the ledger. Realistically, the Koch bill has a difficult road to traverse and passage cannot be predicted with confidence. Most recently, Senator Ervin has introduced a broadly worded proposal that takes a somewhat novel approach to the subject.544 It would prohibit the executive agencies and their personnel from re- quiring any individual to divulge personal information unless the collection of that information could be based upon a constitutional provision and a specific act of Congress. When this is the case, dis- closure would be mandatory. The bill also would limit federal data collection on a voluntary basis to those matters specifically autho- rized by an act of Congress. In this category of inquiries the bill 541. H.R. 7214, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969). 542. Id. §v552(a)(5) 543. Cf.

The fact that the Internal Revenue Code protects the taxpayer against the disclosure of his federal income tax returns by public officials and employees does not give the taxpayer an absolute privilege, and does not prevent a court from ordering that he, rather than public officials or employees, shall produce copies of his returns for inspection and copying by his adversary. 544.

The Ervin bill has some faults. There are a few problems of language that might unduly limit or render un- certain its scope of application. Generally these stem from the absence of an adequate definition of either the character of the in- formation or the nature of the data-gathering activities that would be covered by the bill. Moreover, reliance on the Constitution as a limitation on mandatory disclosures might be rendered nuga- tory by a broad application of the necessary and proper clause. Finally, requiring all voluntary surveys to be predicated on specific acts of Congress might tend to produce a rubber-stamp effect or undue congressional preoccupation with the details of agency sur- veys. A better approach might be to proscribe all forms of volun- tary data-gathering unless the agency can satisfy a series of legislative guidelines or standards.545 On the whole, however, the bill repre- sents a highly desirable attempt both to limit federal data collection activities to those expressly authorized by Congress and to curtail the use of subtle forms of coercion against individuals. Although each of the current legislative proposals can be criti- cized for its lack of scope and the failure of its proponents to inves- tigate the broader implications of informational privacy, the present level of legislative activity is a healthy sign. Furthermore, the cumu- lative effect of these bills may be quite effective. In any event, beyond the possible integration of the various proposals described above, it simply is unrealistic to expect comprehensive legislation to be proposed at this relatively early date. There is insufficient experi- ence with the computer-privacy phenomenon to permit rational and detailed legislative judgments to be made. Indeed, an attempt to achieve them at this time seems premature and might yield an un- malleable product that would prove to be obsolete shortly after its enactment. Furthermore} the somewhat uncertain future shape and application of the technology and the understandable desire on the part of Congress to refrain from interceding in the operation of nonfederal information systems until the need for doing so becomes clear, makes highly detailed statutory regulation in the immediate future unlikely. 545. The prerequisites to conducting a voluntary survey might include: (1) an administrative demonstration of a clear and significant need for the data; (2) a show- ing that the data has not been secured by other federally conducted surveys; (3) a demonstration that the data is not available through prior state, local, or private information-gathering efforts; (4) a finding that the sampling group is no larger than that necessary to obtain the requisite data base; and (5) an articulated administrative determination that the questions to be asked are not intrusive or violative of in- dividual privacy.</page><page sequence="148">1236 Michigan Law Review [Vol. 67:1089 I). Federal Administrative Regulation The present lack of detailed knowledge about the computer's long-term impact indicates that perhaps the problem of how indi- vidual privacy should be protected against the excesses of this new medium is more amenable to administrative treatment than to legislative resolution; at least this may be the case for the foresee- able future. Administrative regulation is less immutable than a statute, thus providing sufficient flexibility to permit experimenta- tion and shorter reaction time when new problems present them- selves. 1. The Locus of Regulatory Power Assuming the validity of this proposition, it is not immediately apparent where power to regulate should be centered and what form the regulation should take. It seems safe to postulate at the outset that regulatory power should not be entrusted to an agency that has operating responsibilities involving the use of personal information. The debate over the proposed National Data Center and revelations before congressional subcommittees546 con- cerning the intrusive activities of the Post Oflice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Immigration and Naturalization Ser- vice have made it abundantly clear that pl-ivacy values often get short shrift if fundamental policy decisions are made by an agency that has a vested interest in gathering and using data.547 The fact that personnel in various agencies have systematically engaged in mail cover operations, electronic bugging, wiretapping, harassment, and other invasions of privacy demonstrates that governmental officials often become too oriented toward the objectives of their institutions or too vulnerable to pressures from other organizations to be entrusted with responsibility for preserving the privacy of others. Consequently, an administrative approach that completely abdicates regulatory control to each agency and bureau probably is unsatisfactory from a privacy-protection prospective and is likely to produce such tremendous variations in practice that there would be little gain over the existing unstructured situation.548 546.

The Census Bureau and the Bureau of the Budget immediately spring to mind. Even though it has an enviable security record,549 the Census Bureau has become so in- doctrinated with the information acquisition syndrome it is difficult to believe that it could overcome its present function and orientation and develop a balanced regulatory scheme for protecting privacy. As to the Bureau of the Budget, its supervision over federal report- ing programs has proven ineffectual from a privacy perspective.550 This is not surprising in view of the institutional bias that the Budget Bureau's duties create, but it does argue against giving the Bureau further responsibility for preserving privacy. It also is worth noting that both agencies are primarily federally oriented and might not be appropriate institutions to the extent that certain activities of nonfederal systems eventually will have to be brought under fed- eral regulation. A more promising candidate for receiving regulatory authority is the Federal Communications Commission, which already has recognized the importance of privacy by including the subject as one of the central concerns of its inquiry into computer communi- cations technology.50l A relatively minor extension of the FCC's statutory jurisdiction would enable it to deal with the full range of computer-privacy problems, including those raised by nonfederal systems.552 Indeed, this might fruitfully be done as an adjunct to its give the Federal Reserve Board extensive regulatory authority.

See text accompanying notes 164-72 supra. 551. Federal Communications Commission Notice of Inquiry, Docket No. 16,979, reprinted in Senate Hearings on Computer Privacy 87. 552. The extent of the FCC's jurisdiction has proved to be a prime subject of controversy in its present inquiry into computer technology (see note 551 stlpra). .See, e.g., IBM Brief at I-6 to I-7: It has been suggested that message switching constitutes a fusion of data processing and communications making separation difficult or impossible. This suggestion results, we believe, from confusion created by the generality of the term "message switching." Message switching has been defined as the technique of receiving a message, storing it until the proper outgoing circuit and station are available, and then retransmitting it towards its destination. The fact that a particular activity constitutes message switching within this definition does not determine whether it should be regulated. It is the purpose of the particular message switch- ing that is determinative. In general, message switching occurs in one of the following forms: (1) As an adjunct to a public transmission sersrice. As such, it is subject to traditional common carrier regulation. (2) As an adjunct to a private data ,processing or private communications sys-</page><page sequence="150">1238 Michigan Law Review [Vol. 67:1089 present investigation of the threat posed by systems that rely on the common carrler networts. Entrusting the field of informational privacy to the FCC could prove to be a less than ideal solution, however. There is some pos- sibility that the FCC would find itself torn by an ideological con- flict of interest, inasmuch as its primary concern is the efficient exploitation of communications technology. In the context of regu- lating the telephone system, for example, economic considerations typically have predominated over efforts to insure the confidentiality of communications.553 And it appears that a similar process is oc- curring in the FCC's present inquiry into data communications; in the responses filed by various organizations, privacy generally has received only minimal attention in comparison to the questions of whether or not regulation of computer systems is economically de- sirable.554 But this may simply reflect the parochialism of the com- munications industries, rather than the Commission's inability to deal with the privacy problem once it directs its attention to that subject. Perhaps it does indicate that it is unwise to burden the FCC with primary responsibility for regulating a highly complex and multifaceted problem that will take it far outside its traditional bailiwick. Moreover, any attempt at comprehensive regulation would require the FCC to enter areas that would be completely new to it, such as single- and multi-level governmental informa- tion systems, computer-manufacturing, and software development, which might represent a potentially unhealthy expansion of its jurisdiction. It is quite possible that none of the existing federal bureaus, agencies, or departments has enough background or is sufficiently independent-in the sense of not being obligated to various insti- tutional "clients" or committed to values of eSiciency or policy objectives that are inconsistent with privacy-to be an effective tem operated by and for the user. Such private use not involving service to others should not be subjected to regulation. (3) As an adjunct to the furnishing of a data processing service. Message switching that is an incidental part of a data processing service should not be subject to regulation. 553.

If this is the case, the conclusion is inescapable: regulatory control must be lodged outside the existing administrative channels. As repugnant as it may sound in an era of expanding governmental involvements, it may be necessary to estab- lish a completely independent agency, bureau, or office perhaps preceded by a Study Commission on Informational Privacy that can establish policy under broad legislative guidelines in order to insure the privacy of all citizens.655 The organization might regulate the nature of the information that can be recorded and stored in various systems, enforce a congressional standard of care for insuring the accuracy of recorded information, and direct various types of data centers to employ the latest technological advances to protect themselves against breaches of security. 2. Functional Aspects of Egective Administrative Control Whatever the most desirable locus and structure for adminis- trative control over the privacy aspects of computer systems may be, the subject obviously involves numerous political implications and any proposal would be subjected to the vagaries of the legislative process. Consequently, any attempt to predict the precise contours of the regulatory scheme at this time would be a somewhat sterile exercise. However, there are several obvious attributes that any ad- ministrative body would have to possess in order to be an effective guardian of informational privacy. A governmental organization that undertakes to regulate any significant aspect of a technology as dynamic and pervasive as the computer must be able to draw upon a wide range of expertise. At a minimum, then, the agency charged with this responsibility should be composed of people who are conversant with the scientific and technical disciplines, the business community, the social sciences, 555. Many of the commentators on the proposals to create a National Data Center stress the importance of locating control of the center outside of the existing regu- latory framework. See, e.g., Note, Privacy and Egsient Government: Proposals for a National Data Center, 82 HARV. L. REV. 400, 404 (1968): The proposed data center would be organized within the Executive Office of the President and would be under the control of the "Director of the Federal Statistical System." The Director would have two advisory councils: one to repre- sent the interests of government users, the other to speak for the private users and the public-at-large. The councils would advise the Director on such matters as confidentiality, user needs, and the burden on those providing information. The Office of Statistical Standards would be transferred from the Bureau of the Budget to become a staff office for the Director. The Bureau of the Census would also be placed under his control on a coordinate level with the new data center.

One potential model for such an organization is the Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance, which was created by the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968.557 One of the basic duties of the agency, and any study commission that might precede it, should be education, both of the policy makers and the public.

In further- ance of its educative function, the agency anxl any antecedent study commission should hold public hearings and symposia on a broad range of subjects, undertake technical and social science research projects, and act as a clearinghouse for information concerning ac- tivity in each of the many disciplines that touch upon computer technology or individual privacy. By use of these and other methods, an informational privacy agency could implement a philosophy analogous to that embodied in proposals to create a Technology Assessment Board558-the belief that it no longer is sufficient simply to respond to technological threats as they become acute, but that it is necessary to anticipate them and undertake enlightened plan- ning to insure that scientific innovation is used in socially desirable ways.559 Another aspect in evolving policy for the computer technology- privacy area would be to grant the agency authority to engage in rulemaking governing the technical features, personnel qualifica- tions, and administrative procedures to be employed by all data centers that deal with substantial quantities of personal informa- tion. Defining the scope of this rulemaking power, and any attendant licensing authority, undoubtedly will be one of the most politically sensitive phases of establishing the agency. Controversy certainly will arise over whether or not the agency's activities should extend to systems operated by state and local governments or private in- terests. Similarly, industrial groups can be expected to oppose at- tempts to apply privacy protection standards to the manufacturing of computer hardware and transmission equipment as well as to software systems. Although ideally the agency's regulatory power should be broad enough to cover those activities of nonfederal in- formation systems and business concerns that bear on individual privacy, it stands to reason that any rulemaking power probably will be exercised sparingly in these contexts and might have to be more circumscribed than in the case of federal data systems. One can hope that self-regulation and the availability of model systems will obviate 558. H.R. 6698, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967). 559.

To implement the controls that it ultimately deems appropriate for protecting informational privacy, the new agency should engage in several other types of activity. One method of encouraging com- pliance is suggested by the extensive press coverage and popular response to congressional hearings on the proposed National Data Center and the credit bureau industry. Apparently there is enough concern for privacy to make the glare of public hearings and pro- nouncements a realistic avenue of expression to which both govern- mental and nongovernmental groups often will respond. But it would be illusory to believe that public or private officials are always responsive to press releases or the power of persuasion. Despite the fact that two congressional subcommittees were holding hearings during April 1969 on the propriety of some of the census questions and the desirability of retaining the criminal sanctions for non- compliance, the Census Bureau, apparently with White House ap- proval, ordered the printing of the 1970 census in its present form, although it did reduce the number of people who will receive the long form of the census from fifteen to twelve million.560 The move was justiSed with the usual bureaucratic protest that it was "too late" to make changes.56l More effective would be statutory author- ity in a single agency to investigate, direct correction, and award appropriate relief for any alleged information abuses brought to its attention by citizens. Through the use of these techniques and its ability to negotiate with the information managers, the agency or commission could play the role of an information ombudsman.662 In developing procedures for discharging its role as a privacy protector, the agency shollld place central reliance on measures that give some level of effective control over personal information to the individual.

The law's traditional dedication to ideals of due process indicates that any set of rules regulating the handling of personal information should accord the individual, or someone who will represent his interests adequately, the right to receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before decisions are made concerning the information.564 The right to be heard should include the ability to rebut damaging evaluations565 and the right to demand that personal information conform to minimal standards of accuracy.566 Disputes concerning the exercise of these rights undoubtedly will arise, and the development of an expeditious administrative means of resolving conflicts might be desirable. 563.

See also H.R. 7214, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., § 552a(a) (1969): Each agency which shall maintain records concerning any individual which are indexed according to the individual's name and which contain any information obtained from any source other than such individual shall . . . * . * * (6) permit an individual to supplement the information contained in his record with any information such individual deems pertinent to his record. 566.

The tendency of the so-called independent regulatory agencies to become captives of the industries they supposedly regulate is a disheartening prior his- tory from which to proceed.567 Perhaps with proper staffing and well- chosen lines of authority, an information agency can achieve the degree of independence needed to perform its watchdog roTe. The other extreme must be avoided as well. It cannot be permitted to become an island unto itself, populated by technocrats whose con- duct is shielded by the alleged omniscience of the machines they manage, neither responsive nor responsible to anyone. Nor can its activities and regulations be permitted to ossify. For the foreseeable future the key to effective activity in the computer-privacy area will be to maintain the flexibility to adjust to changes in the technologi- cal and social environment. IX. CONCLUSION Bureaucracy is the only way to coordinate the complex functions of a modern economy and society and therefore cannot be dismissed with a curse. Yet it is also an enormous potential source of arbitrary, impersonal power which folds, bends, spindles and mutilates indi- viduals but keeps IBM cards immaculate.568 It may seem surprising, and perhaps distressing to some, that several of the tentative suggestions offered in this Article as re- sponses to the problem of preserving the modest level of privacy ment for the purpose of storing and distributing personal data to third parties unless a public necessity is established after public hearings. See also S. 823, Dlst Cong., 1st Sess., § 164(9)(e) (1969) (Proxmire Bill). Even in the context of the mass circulation media, in which first amendment con- siderations are clearly strongest, it has been argued that a state still might impose a duty to print retractions or corrections of damaging news items. Barron, Access to the Press A New First Smendment Right, 80 HARV. L. REV. 1641, 1659 (1967). Further analogical support for a right to correct potentially damaging data items can be found in 39 U.S.C. § 4009 (Supp. III, 1965-1967), which provides that the individual has a right to compel anyone who mails "pandering advertisements'' to remove his name from the mailing list. 567. Cf. House Hearings on the Computer and Invasion of Privacy 126 (statement of Paul Baran, computer expert for the Rand Corporation): [Regulation] is viscerally unsatisfying as it carries with it a built-in loss of freedom. The creation of another government agency peering over one's shoulder contains the possible dangers of bureaucratic delay and arbitrary conclusions based upon inadequate understanding of complex problems. Historically, Government regulatory agencies start as highly effective bodies but lose momentum as the original personnel leave and their replacements come from the industry being regulated. For a discussion of these problems in a different context, see Bonfield, Representation for the Poor in Federal Rulemaking, 67 MICH. L. REV. 511, 536-545 (1969). 568. M. HARRINGTON, TOWARD A DEMOCRATIC LEFT 144 (1968).</page><page sequence="157">April 1969] Computers and Prizzacy 1245 that we presently enjoy against the intrusive capacities of computer technology a problem that is only beginning to emerge-should entail extensive federal intervention. Perhaps this merely reflects the impact that the computer is having on our society and the way it has permeated the daily affairs of virtually every individual and institution. With considerable justification, modern information- transfer networks have been described as a global electronic equiva- lent of the biological central nervous system569 because of their unprecedented ability to interrelate social institutions, to create awareness and responsiveness to human problems, and to provide a massive store of information subject to instant recall.570 As such, the computer is capable of immense social good, or monumental harm, depending upon how human beings decide to use it. Given the magnitude and significance of this new technology, a response from the national level is necessary. And if the foregoing discussion seems slightly alarmist in tone, that is so because it is necessary to counteract the fact that "progress is a comfortable disease''571 and the all-too^often complacent attitude of citizens toward the management of our afEairs by astigmatic ad- ministrators in government and the private sector. The very real benefits conferred by computer technology may opiate our aware- ness of the price that is exacted in terms of personal freedom. It also seems desirable to sound the klaxon to arouse a greater aware- ness of the possibility that the computer is precipitating a realign- ment in the patterns of societal power and it is becoming increasingly important to decision-making in practically all of our significant governmental and nongovernmental institutions. As society becomes more and more information oriented, the central issue that emerges to challenge our legal system is how to contain the excesses and channel the benefits of this new form of power. If the concept of personal privacy is fundamental to our democratic tradition of in- 569. Cf. M. MCLUHAN, UNDERSTANDING MEDIA: THE EXTENSIONS OF MAN 304 (paper ed., 1964): Any process that approaches instant interrelation of a total field tends to raise itself to the level of conscious awareness, so that computers seem to "think." In fact, they are highly specialized at present, and quite lacking in the full process of interrelation that makes for consciousness. Obviously, they can be made to simulate the process of consciousness, just as our electric global networks now begin to simulate the condition of our central nervous system. See also Rapoport, Technological Mod els of the Nervous System, in THE MODELING OF MIND: COMPUTERS AND INTELLIGENCE 25 (paper ed., 1968). 570. Cf. Benn, Where Power Belongs, THE NATION, Aug. 26, 1968, at 136, 137: "Processed information about individuals could be the basis for a police state, and a mass of new safeguards would be required. But on the positive side this informa- tion could and should compel government to take account of every single individual in the development of its policy. Just to exist will be to participate." 571. 100 SELECrED POEMS BY E. E.

Perhaps the most imperative need at this point in time is a sub stantial input of human resources to help solve the many privacy problems posed by the new technologies. The experimental labo- ratories exist the federal agencies and many private organizations, such as the Interuniversity Communication Council, can provide the necessary structural context in which to test the privacy-pro- tecting capacity of hardware, software, and administrative pro- cedures. The scientific and business communities seem to be awak- ening-privacy protection techniques appear to be receiving in- creased attention in both of these fraternities. But is the legal profession ready to come to grips with the ramifications of the com- puter? Leading professional groups, such as the American Law In- stitute, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the American Bar Association, must move to the forefront of the eSort to develop a legal framework that will secure personal privacy while permitting eSective implementation of the new information technologies.</page></plain_text>
