<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Bergsonian Poetics' and the Beast: Jane Harrison's Translations from the Russian Marilyn Schwinn Smith The collaboration between Jane Harrison (1850-1928), Cambridge scholar of ancient Greek religion, and Aleksey Remizov (1877-1957), Petersburg modernist with a strong interest in Old Russian culture, on the first English translation of the Life of the Archpriest Avvakum (1924) and on Harrison's The Book of the Bear (1926) seems, at first glance, a most unlikely event. Yet the path leading Harrison from the zenith of her career as a classical scholar, the publication of Themis in 1912, to the publication of her translations of Russian bear tales, closely follows the course of British engagement with Russian literature and culture through the First World War and its aftermath, from the 1912 'Russian Fever' sparked by Constance Garnett's translation of Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov, to the introduction of Russian modernist writers to anglophone readers in the 1920s. It also marks the continuation of her classical studies into the modern period. The present essay traces the genesis of Harrison's interest in Russia back to her work on Themis. I will argue that Harrison's discovery of the work of Henri Bergson, the application of his theories to her understanding of totemism, and her acquaintance with Aleksey Remizov followed a logical course of development that led to the publication, timed for the Christmas market, of a children's book - The Book of the Bear. Research for this article was partially funded by a Franklin Grant of the American Philosophical Society. The author also wishes to express gratitude to Dr Stanley J. Rabinowitz, Director of the Center for Russian Culture, Amherst College, Amherst, MA, for access to the Remizov Papers.

She attributed her change of heart to the writings of two French philosophers - Henri Bergson and Emile Durkheim. Deciding to start afresh, she produced Themis instead.1 The discovery in 1907 of Bergson's L' Evolution creatrice (1907) produced the most profound shift in her thinking. She attributed to this book her new understanding of the pre-Olympian gods, the mystery gods who are the primary interest of Themis: 'I saw in a word that Dionysos, with every other mystery god, was an instinctive attempt to express what Professor Bergson calls duree, that life which is one, indivisible and yet ceaselessly changing' (p. xii). The social theories of Emile Durkheim proved equally seminal to Harrison's emerging theory of the social and emotional ground of religious experience. Her extensive work on chthonic practices in Prolegomena , together with the appeal the mystery gods held for her, stimulated her interest in the large volume of work then emerging on totemism. This was the subject of Harrison's correspondence with Durkheim in 1910, when she sent him her unsigned review of James Frazer's Totemism and Exogamy .2 In his reply, Durkheim discussed the book he was currently writing, primarily concerned with totemism.3 Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse, le systeme totemique en Australie was published in 1912, the same year as Themis . Harrison's interpretation of duree and her application of duree to current theories of totemism constitute the root of The Book of the Bear . Although British interest in Bergson faded after the First World War, he was widely influential in the opening decades of the twentieth century.4 In 1911 alone, Bergson delivered two public lectures at Oxford, where an honorary doctorate was conferred on him at a special ceremony on 27 May; he was elected a corresponding Fellow of the British Academy; lectures were delivered at University College London to prepare an audience for the course of four public lectures by Bergson himself (the series was over-subscribed).

However, before her embrace of Russian, the impact of Bergson's British lectures is made evident in Themis , in which Harrison narrates an evolutionary arc, from an aboriginal therio- and phyto-morphism to the anthropomorphism of the Olympians, grafting Bergson's concept of the dual nature of human consciousness (variously attuned to interior or to external experience) onto the developmental schema typical of nineteenth-century anthropology. The arc describes the gradual yet inexorable transition in human epistemology from an earlier stage, when the balance is more attuned to a Bergsonian interior consciousness, grounded in 'won-differentiation', to a later stage, when the balance is tipped to favour exterior consciousness. Chapter 5 identifies the earliest and pre-rational stage with 'totemism', in which 'the human and the animal group is felt as continuous' (p. 126). Harrison contrasted totemism to 'a later stage of epistemology, a stage in which a man stands off from his own imagination, looks at it, takes an attitude towards it, sees it as an object' (p. 127). In chapter ten, Harrison cites Bergson's published Oxford lectures in support of her denunciation of the Olympians: 'All this, all life and that which is life and reality - Change and Movement - the Olympian renounces. Instead he chooses Deathlessness and Immutability - a seeming Immortality which is really the denial of life, for life is change' (p. 468). 7 She mourns the passing of the earlier epistemology, when 'man has not yet got his own individuality clear, but is intensely conscious of life lived, of power felt, though not yet of isolated personality', and regrets the hyper-development of that 5 'Professor Bergson on the Soul: Lecture at University College', The Times, 21 October 1911, p. 4. 6 'Professor Bergson on The Soul: Change and Movement', The Times , 23 October 1911, p. 4.

It is in many ways pure loss' (pp. 472, 449). This is the loss standing behind all her subsequent statements regarding what westerners desired to learn from the Russians - a re-equilibration of consciousness, reviving the interior consciousness characteristic of totemism. On the basis of Bergson's London lectures, Harrison postulated that language reflected Bergson's dual modes of consciousness: either within duree , where consciousness comes close to 'intuition', or external to duree, which corresponds to ordinary or 'scientific' consciousness. Shortly after the lectures, Harrison evidently sought confirmation of her interpretation, for Bergson replied to her letter: 'It's possible, as you observe the facts, that languages less analytical than ours bring us valuable information on psychological processes in a pure state, as they are given immediately to consciousness'.8 Harrison expounds the 'facts' of such 'less analytical languages' in the 'Holophrase and Holopsychosis' section of Themis, where she writes: The holophrase shows us man entangled as it were in his own activities, he and his environment utterly involved. He has as yet no 'soul', but he has life and has it more abundantly. Language then would seem to throw light on two points . . . [Primitive man] is conscious of life, of mana , but not of individual spirits . . . Second, man felt himself at first not as a personality separate from other persons, but as the warm excited centre of a group; language tells us what we have already learnt from ritual, that the 'soul' of primitive man is 'congregationalized'. (pp. 474-5) Harrison would soon apply these 'facts' to the Russian language and derive comparable conclusions about Russian psychology. When she took up Russian, it was as a language 'less analytical than ours', and consequently she derived from it a national psychology that appeared to be less analytic, less scientific, and therefore more enmeshed in duree . Harrison's familiarity with aspects of Russian culture grew during the pre-war years: the 1912 'Russian Fever' sparked her interest in the literature, while Tolstoy's theory of art featured prominently in her Ancient Art and Ritual. In connection with her explorations of ancient Greek ritual, Harrison took note of work by other classicists on survivals in other contemporary Slavonic communities.

In Ancient Art and Ritual she took special note of George Calderon's work on the Slavic 'Charila' rites, and was surely familiar with the work of her colleague, Arthur Evans, in the Balkans. Even Harrison's interest in the figure of the bear was tending towards Russia, and in Ancient Art and Ritual she offered an extended discussion of bear rituals among the Ainos of the Russian island, Sakhalin, connecting them with her Greek examples. In addition to her familiarity with current ethnography, Harrison would have noted Nicholas Roerich's designs for the Ballets Russes production of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring , which opened in London just after the completion of Ancient Art and Ritual. Roerich's costumes boldly proclaimed the traditional Russian belief in the bear as forefather.9 The war broke out while Harrison was putting together a collection of her essays and lectures from the previous ten years. Scholarly work felt irrelevant in the face of the Belgian atrocities, so she requested a postponement of publication until she was able to write a new essay expressing her reaction to the war.10 By Christmas Eve, 1914, Harrison had completed it: Alpha and Omega, with an 'Epilogue on the War: Peace with Patriotism', came out in 1915. Her reading in Russian literature directly influenced her response to the war. In 'Epilogue on the War', as in later writings on Russia, Dostoevsky served as a touchstone for her notion of Russian 'spirituality', and Tolstoy's pacifism became a touchstone for her sentiments regarding warfare. If the war helped focus Harrison's personal scholarly attention on Russia, then it also involved her in the public debate surrounding the nation's new status as a military ally. Previously, British public and political opinion might have been expected to align itself with Germany rather than Russia. Despite three decades of increasing appreciation for Russian culture, public opinion towards Russia as a political entity remained predominantly negative, the common image of Russia being that of a barbaric, tyrannical, and reactionary nation whose institutions and policies were inimical to British values. British 9 Harrison cites the Russian ballets among examples of the contemporary dance craze as evidence of the 'real recurrent need' of primitive ritual, such as the 'calling up' rites enacting the 'uprising of the Earth Spirit' in spring (Ancient Art and Ritual (London, 1915), pp. 78-9, 207-8). 10 For an overview of Harrison's reaction to the first months of the war, see Jessie Stewart, Jane Ellen Harrison: A Portrait from Letters (London, 1959), pp. 147-59. 318</page><page sequence="6">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) 'Russophiles', largely on their own initiative and independently of government efforts, worked hard to shift public awareness away from the well-publicized excesses of political repression and towards an appreciation of the country's cultural achievements. As a result of such propaganda (as well as pragmatic considerations resulting from the wartime alliance), Germany was transformed in the public mind 'from a country associated with art and learning to one that was seen as barbaric and brutal'.11 German 'intellectuality' was juxtaposed with Russian 'spirituality'. Harrison had engaged directly in this debate in September 1914, when together with fifty-one others she signed a declaration published in The Times. While asserting their respect for German culture, the authors nonetheless insisted that no culture has the 'right by brute force to impose its culture upon other nations', and rejected the notion that 'the iron military bureaucracy of Prussia represents a higher form of human society than the free constitutions of Western Europe'.12 Harrison's most frequently cited comment on Russia was made privately in a letter to the colleague who drafted this declaration, Gilbert Murray. She wrote: that is just what I longed to have said that what ever wild beast Russia makes of herself she still cares more than any other nation for things of the spirit and that is priceless (though as you say dangerous) that was why I wanted the paragraph kept in the Authors' manifesto - we literary cusses owe enormously to her. Just now I am feeling it inwardly in learning Russian: the words even seem like Greek to seek for the things of the spirit.13 Then, in December 1914, just days before she completed her essay on the war, Harrison's name together with thirty- three others was subscribed to a further Times statement printed under the heading: 'Russia in Literature: Tribute by British Men of Letters'. The centrality of 'culture versus barbarism' to public discourse on the war is here expressed in almost 'Harrisonian' terms, clearly indicating how mainstream her thoughts and sentiments were: most of all it was that ever-present sense of spiritual values, behind the material and utterly transcending the material, which enables Russian literature to move so naturally in a world of the spirit, where there are no II See Michael Hughes, 'Searching for the Soul of Russia: British Perceptions of Russia during the First World War', Twentieth Century British History, 20 (2009), 198-226 (p. 204). 12 The Times , 18 September 1914, p. 3. 13 Harrison Papers 1/1/31, Newnham College Archive, Cambridge University. 319</page><page sequence="7">Marilyn Schwinn Smith/Jane Harrison barriers between the ages and the nations, but all mankind is one . . . And it is at a time like this . . . that we must . . . once more see life with the simplicity of the barbarian or the child.14 Harrison's 'Epilogue' pursues the basic themes of these letters, exploring the psychologies of the warring nations: Germany is over- theoretical. Untouched, it would seem, by modern realism, she still worships abstractions . . . She forgets that there is no such thing as 'Kultur,' though there are cultivated men. She lacks Russian realism - the sense of the live fact - of actuality, always parti-coloured. The Russians have already learned the inadequacy of theories and ideals, while the Germans remain 'over-educated, unduly docile, not merely to a military power, but to ideas; they are drunk, not with beer, but with theories'.15 'Russian realism - the sense of the live fact - of actuality' is none other than the Bergsonian continuum of indivisible flux originally found in Themis. Harrison would go on to develop this idea in terms of the Russian language, and the call to see 'life with the simplicity of the barbarian or the child' was to be answered with the ethos of Remizov and The Book of the Bear. Four wartime texts reflect the development of Harrison's view of Russia. The first two, 'Epilogue on the War' and her 1915 preface to her cousin Marion Chilton Harrison's Byliny Book: Hero Tales of Russia , were written at the beginning of the War, when she was embarking on the study of the Russian language. ( Byliny , a term translated by Harrison as 'What-has-Been', were oral epics which were sung, and have been considered a continuation of the Homeric tradition.) These two pieces reflect her intense interest in the War and are representative of the national discourse on Britain's new ally. The second two, Russia and the Russian Verb and Aspects , Aorists and the Classical Tripos , demonstrate both her rapidly acquired knowledge of the language, literature, and culture, and the continuing influence of Bergson.16 The terms of Bergson's interior consciousness ('real time', continuous change and movement) and exterior consciousness (time segmented into discrete and analy sable moments which can be 'judged') are readily transferable to the contrast drawn between the German and Russian psychologies. The Germans, so adept at analytic (exterior) thought, have the will to impose their reality on others.

In Harrison's case, the extension of Bergsonian terms to national psychologies is deliberate. The pervasiveness of the same rhetoric in the discourse on the war suggests that the British at large may have internalized Bergsonian concepts to the degree that they too perceived a possible connection between analytic, scientific thinking and the atrocities of the Belgian invasion. The notion of a national psychology was not peculiar to Harrison, but widespread at the beginning of the twentieth century. While Harrison's knowledge of psychology was derived from several theorists of the era, her articulation of 'national psychology' derives explicitly from Bergson, and Russia and the Russian Verb: A Contribution to the Psychology of the Russian People is principally a Bergsonian text. Beginning with the distinction between the Greek aorist and the Russian perfective aspect as, respectively, a 'stopped action' and an 'accomplished action', Harrison moves directly to an identification of the imperfective aspect with Bergson's notion of duree, 'of process, of actuality, of the thing lived'. To this she contrasts the perfective: the thing achieved is the last word of duree , it is the action expended that, in a moment, will be spent; we are literally 'in at the death.' In a word, the perfective, because it is the end of the action, is the beginning of the intellectual act of abstraction or the moral, quasi-intellectual act of judgment . . . You have done with it, and you stand outside of it, ready for mental action or abstraction; you judge it rather than feel it; you are no longer one with it . . . The tendency in all languages as they become more and more intellectualized is to create perfective forms, to hurry on, so to speak, to results and abstractions . . . Reason has little use for the imperfective, but emotion, sympathy, hungers after it. (pp. 8-9) In this work, as in 'Peace with Patriotism', Harrison cites Dostoevsky as abstaining from moral judgement and sympathizing with the sinner. She attributes the capacity to abstain from moral judgement and remain 'in-process-of-going-to-be' to a consciousness shaped by the linguistic characteristics available to it. She further asserts that the English can learn these capacities from the Russians, and that they have the desire to do so. This is the rationale behind her rather remarkable statement: 'I want to use these aspects, I long to be able to, I need them, they feed me spiritually' (p. 11). Perhaps even more startling is her opening comment: 'It is very rash of me to attempt to speak of either Russia or the Russian verb. I am only just beginning to learn about either' (p. 3). Harrison confessed to having decided on the theme of her lecture, given on 1 7 October 321</page><page sequence="9">Marilyn Schwinn Smith/Jane Harrison 1915 to the Cambridge Society of Heretics (which would become Russia and the Russian Verb), when she 'had been learning Russian a few weeks' (p. 13). She had begun to learn Russian at the outbreak of the war from displaced refugees, embarking on formal study under Paul Boyer at the Ecole des langues orientales in Paris just six months before her lecture. What had only been a 'guess' when she first proposed to speak to the Heretics on Russia was confirmed to her satisfaction by her discovery of Andre Mazon's book Emploie des aspects du verbe russe (St Petersburg, 1914) at the Ecole. Harrison cites Mazon to bolster the pedigree of her Bergsonian theory as 'linguistic fact': 'Aspect is among the grammatical facts of the languages in which it exists, the one which has the deepest psychological roots.' She was especially gratified by the conclusion he draws regarding use of the imperfective aspect: 'to see and to evoke is the essential tendency of the Russian imagination' (p. 14). Aspects , Aorists and the Classical Tripos is the revised version of Russia and the Russian Verb. Here the relationship between a language and its speakers is given an elegant formulation: 'When we love a language as contrasted with a literature, we fall under the spell not of a person, an individual genius, but of a people imaged in the speech they have made' (p. 5). The analysis of aspect is vastly expanded. Lloyd Storr-Best gave Harrison's linguistic analysis in Aspects a glowing notice in The Classical Review, pointing out that Russian grammarians were arriving at similar conclusions about aspect, and enjoining his colleagues to adopt new terminology in analyses of the Greek aorist.17 At the opposite pole was Paul Shorey's high-handed mockery of Harrison's Bergsonian bent.18 One glimpses here the faultline separating the generation for whom Harrison wished to speak from their elders, who felt their entire culture under assault - the faultline noted ten years later in Dmitry Mirsky's description of Harrison's 'historic mission' as 'the destruction of the morality on which the mentality of the "governing people"... of England was based'.19 Later in the century, when both Harrison and Bergson fell into some disrepute, her notions about Russian verbal aspect were belittled by scholars for their 'psychologizing'. Yet it is notable that both Bergson and Harrison attracted scholarly attention at the end of the twentieth century. Even Harrison's notions regarding the psychological implications of verbal aspect resonate with aspects of contemporary theory.20 17 Lloyd Storr-Best, Classical Review , 34 (1920), 113-14. 18 Paul Shorey, Classical Philology , 15 (1920), 302. 19 D.

Harrison confesses, 'I began Russian simply to get at the literature. I wanted to read Tolstoy, Chehov [sic], Dostoevsky and the rest in the original', with the quick qualification that with Russian it was language not literature that cast its spell'. Yet after four years of intense language study, literature emerges as near-equal partner in helping Harrison toward 'a new birth and a new life'. She returns to the idea of Dostoevsky as an exemplar of the non-judgemental, 'in-process-of-going-to-be' writer, but chooses Ivan Goncharov's 1858 novel Oblomov to exemplify what she believes both 'a new generation demands' and 'Russia has to offer' - namely 'this living into things' (pp. 6, 7, 26). In selecting Oblomov , neither fully translated nor well known in Britain at the time, Harrison may have been indebted, once again, to Andre Mazon, whose doctoral thesis had been a biography of Goncharov.21 Though Mazon does not conduct a grammatical analysis of Goncharov's style, nor mention aspect, he does draw attention to the text's powerful attention to detail, its depiction of interior life, and the consequent quality of time. These are characteristics of particular interest to Harrison as she turns toward literature as an expression of national psychology. Her interest in Oblomov inheres in the novel's expression of 'Oblomovshchina' (a word to be found in any Russian dictionary, she notes), a condition she defines as 'the imperfective state incarnate', and she valorizes the novel for its 'epic leisure, its dream- like duree' The point Harrison makes about the novel is that it displays a capacity she finds distinctive in the Russian literary psyche, and which she defines as follows: 'In his imperfective way [the Russian] lives into his subject till he almost ceases to be artist - so intense is his realization. He feels the thing so closely, so fully, that he has no need to pump up emotion and relive it in imagination just for the "sake of sensation'" (pp. 27, 31). Harrison next turns to a 'little folk-poem' by Nekrasov, 'Zelenyi shum', or, as she refers to it, 'a title quite untranslateable. The "new-green rustle" or buzz'. The untranslatability of the Russian text is in fact the point of Harrison's excursus on the poem. The gist of her argument is derived from the poem's opening words - H^;eT-ry^;eT - present-tense imperfective verbs, bonded by a hyphen, rather than a conjunction. She interprets this construction, 'countless in Russian, specially in epic and peasant Russian', as representative 21 Andre Mazon, Un Maitre de roman russe: Ivan Goncharov. 1812-1891 (Paris, 1914). 323</page><page sequence="11">Marilyn Schwinn Smith/Jane Harrison of a consciousness which 'sees or rather feels things whole ', not so broken into discrete parts that it should need a conjunction. After summarizing and translating the poem's final stanza, Harrison draws her Bergsonian conclusion: 'The imperfective then dominates Russian language and Russian literature; shall we be far wrong if we conclude that the imperfective is the leading note in general Russian psychology, and that it is this imperfectiveness that the modern world both needs and desires?' (pp. 31-3). The extravagance of Harrison's language and her use of the cliches of wartime discussion of Russia - 'the Russian Soul' or 'spiritual' vs 'intellectual' - have been perceived by later readers as imprecise or sentimental. Re-grounding Harrison's argument in its historical context may reduce our unease with her enthusiasm. There is a definite rigour to Harrison's thought, even though the passion with which she expressed herself induced an extreme discomfort with what was, after all, a direct challenge to inherited cultural values and standards. Harrison had found in Bergson a descriptive language for the religious impulse or experience. The 'spiritual' was that aspect of the psyche attuned inward, immersed in the pure flux of unceasing and non-articulated change. Understanding language and psychology ('personality') to be mutually reflexive, Harrison used language and its literature as a meter from which to read the balance of inward ('spiritual') and external ('intellectual') capacities to which a language's speakers (and writers) were given. Harrison's formal and informal writing reflected her ongoing monitoring of contemporary sentiment to discern the current mood of the younger generation; the experience of war cemented Harrison's conviction that the younger generation thirsted for the spiritual rather than the rational, and it was through the study of the Russian language and literature that salvation from the latter was to be found. Yet given the caveat that certain linguistic features are 'untranslatable', one wonders how Harrison's translations from the Russian were to deliver the 'imperfectiveness that the modern world both needs and desires'. She would 'solve' this problem through her choice of genre. Study at the Ecole stood Harrison in good stead for the difficult language of the texts she would translate in the 1920s. She was proud of her oral proficiency, developed through work with native speakers, but she was most grateful to Paul Boyer, to whom she dedicated Aspects, Aorists and the Classical Tripos , for her solid grounding in grammar and exposure to a wide variety of literary texts, from saints' lives to modernist writers. One of the latter was Aleksey Remizov, first 324</page><page sequence="12">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) mentioned in a letter from Harrison to Gilbert Murray in early 1916: 1 am now embarking on the lives of Russian Saints . . . There is a modern Remezov [sic] I am taken by - but he uses too many hard words.'22 When she retired from Newnham and moved to Paris in 1922, Harrison renewed her many Russian relationships begun during the war years, and quickly engaged an expanded circle from among the community of post-revolutionary exiles. Among her new acquaintances was the Russian philosopher Lev Shestov, whom she had cited approvingly in Aspects , Aorists and the Classical Tripos : we want not so much a science as an art of life' (p. 33). On 3 February 1924, Shestov introduced Harrison to Remizov, who had recently relocated from Berlin to Paris. A few weeks later, Remizov' s friend Dmitry Mir sky was introduced by Remizov to both Harrison and Shestov. As a group, they decided that Harrison and her fellow-in-Russian companion, Hope Mirrlees, should translate one of Remizov' s favourite texts, The Life of the Archpriest AvvakumP Awakum (1621-1682) was the guiding force among the Old Believers, a group opposed to Patriarch Nikon's reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church. His autobiography was the first such work written in the Russian vernacular, and its embrace by Russian modernists parallels their other interests in Russia's medieval traditions. Recent scholarship attributes to Harrison a personal interest in Awakum, related to her lifelong attraction to High Church Anglicanism. Margaret Armstrong notes that 'Awakum, like Archbishop Laud and Orpheus was killed for introducing ritual practices', and remarks on the great similarities between controversies in Laud's 17th century England, Awakum's 17th century Russia, and Newman's 19th century England. Harrison's delight must have been palpable when she discovered the name of Awakum's church: St. Saviour's, the same name as the first Tractarian church located in Yorkshire.24 22 Jane Harrison to Gilbert Murray, 22 January 1916 (Harrison Papers 1/1/33, Newnham College Archive). Harrison does not mention which Remizov text she has been reading, but since his name comes up in association with lives of the saints, she may have been reading from his 1907 Limonar ' - a modernist re-working of saints' lives and medieval apocryphal texts. 23 I have constructed this chronology from correspondence from Shestov, Mirsky, and Harrison in the A. Remizov and S. Dovgello-Remizova Papers, Center for Russian Culture, Amherst College, and correspondence from Harrison and Shestov in the Harrison and Mirrlees Papers at Newnham College, Cambridge University. 24 Margaret M.

His evaluation of the language - 'Awakum's Russian, archaic in detail, is essentially the same as the spoken Russian of to-day - which knows (or at least ten years ago knew) no slang'25 - resonates with Remizov's great love for the purity of Awakum's language and with the comparable oral quality of Remizov's language in the folkloric tales Harrison was soon to translate. The Harrison-Mirrlees translation of The Life of the Archpriest Avvakum was given a lengthy review in the Times Literary Supplement , in which the paper's regular Russian reviewer, R. D. Charques, emphasized the literary and historical significance of the original. On the translation he commented thus: Scarcely anything has been written in English or French on the subject of Awakum's part in the progress (or decadence) of religious thought in Russia; and, so far as we know, not a line of his writings has been translated. We cannot be too grateful to the present translators for their work or speak too highly of their precise achievement. The translation must have been of exceeding difficulty; but it has been done with such skill and sympathy, even down to the preservation of a slight archaism of language, that by itself it may almost be regarded as a genuine piece of creative work.26 This 'archaism' was also a feature of the same writers' translations of Russian folktales. But the more important continuity lay in their collaboration. The Book of the Bear represented an ideal marriage of Harrison's and Remizov's common interests, and their meeting in 1924 only confirmed Harrison's initial attraction to his works in 1916. The period spent working on Avvakum afforded them the opportunity to become well acquainted. Remizov read his stories to Harrison and Mirrlees; his wife, Seraphima, gave them language lessons. Postcards illustrated with wild animals were exchanged. Towards the end of November 1924, on completion of Avvakum, she declared to Mirsky: 'Knowing my totemistic tendencies you will not be surprised that we are writing a small book for children or persons in their dotage - to 25 D.

By translating some of Remizov's bear tales and publishing them in a book for children, Harrison thought to introduce not just Remizov, but all that she valued in Russian culture to the next generation. The concept of this new book was rooted in Harrison's adoption of the bear as her personal theriomorph, and its significance lay in her Bergsonian interpretation of totemism. Just as Harrison's embrace of the Russian language and literature can be traced to Themis and to that book's refraction of Bergson's theories of duree and consciousness, so too can her 'totemistic tendencies'. Harrison's desire to erase the human- animal boundary complements her desire 'to use these aspects'; the qualities characteristic of totemistic epistemology, pre-individuation, and non-differentiation, were the ground of both her insight into Bergson's duree and her appreciation of writers and nations who, as she saw it, refrained from judgement or moralizing (foremost among them being, of course, the Russians). Harrison's discernment of these ideal qualities in her reading of Remizov' s bear tales can be inferred from two texts: an essay written by Hope Mirrlees whilst the two women worked on The Book of the Bear , and the book's preface, written jointly.28 'Some Aspects of the Art of Alexey Mikhailovich Remizov' demonstrates Mirrlees's familiarity with the existing literature on and by Remizov, yet a number of points clearly represent Harrison's 'poetics', and hint at the short 'tales' that would be included in The Book of the Bear. Mirrlees' opening assertion that Remizov resembles 'St. Francis of Assisi, though he never preaches to birds and elements, or, indeed, to anybody' reprises Harrison's 'Preface' to the Byliny Book :29 Volga learnt all his wisdom from the beasts and birds. S. Francis used to preach to the birds, but Volga let the beasts and birds preach to him, and that is better, for the Bible says: Ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee; And the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee. The first story is about Volga, and in the first picture you see him listening to a wise old Bear.30 27 Smith, 'Jane Ellen Harrison: Forty-Seven Letters', p. 74. 28 We know for certain only that Mirrlees translated at least two of the Remizov stories (see Smith, 'Forty-Seven Letters' p. 79). Harrison herself probably worked on verse translations of Krylov, whose fables had been the subject of her Russian courses at Newnham. 29 Hope Mirrlees, 'Some Aspects of the Art of Alexey Mikhailovich Remizov', p. 1. Corrected draft, circa late 1924/early 1925 (Hope Mirrlees Papers 6/3/5. Newnham College Archive).

In the 'Psychology of Totemism' section of Themis , Harrison had stressed that 'if we become "as little children" ', then the totemistic habit of identifying with 'plants, animals and stones' no longer 'staggers' the mind (p. 121). More than half the second text, the preface to The Book of the Bear, is devoted to Remizov. In a key passage, Harrison singles out the absence of moralizing - a quality she had identified with the Russian psyche since 'Peace with Patriotism' of 1914 - as characteristic of Remizov' s totemistic consciousness: Once, at a party in Paris, we introduced Remizov to a witty French woman. As he is almost unknown outside of Russia, his name conveyed nothing to her. 'Who was it that you introduced to me?' she asked afterwards; was it Aesop?' The question took our breath away; for the one word 'Aesop' . . . seems the key to Remizov's significance and charm. Besides, since Aesop, nobody has written more deliciously about beasts (especially about bears) than Remizov . . . But Remizov is a far more cunning craftsman than Aesop, and when he chooses can do the most difficult thing in the world - write fables that have no moral. Perhaps he learned the secret from the main source of his inspiration - folk-tales.32 Where, in her work on language and psychology, Harrison had claimed to find 'older' modes of consciousness still operative in the Russian aspectual system, she now discerned in Russian folk (and religious) culture archaic forms and practices virtually eradicated in western Europe. Where once, in the novel Oblomov , she had found confirmation of her linguistic theories regarding duree, she would now support her argument about 'totemistic tendencies' with reference to Russian folk literature.33 At the beginning of her career, Harrison had 31 Mirrlees, 'Some Aspects of Remizov', p. 2. 32 The Book of the Bear, translated by Jane Harrison and Hope Mirrlees (London, 1926), pp. ix-x (page references subsequently given in-text). Contemporary scholarship supports Harrison's distinction regarding the amorality of folktales versus the accretion of morality into literary adaptations, such as Aesop's fables. See Jack V. Haney, 'Introduction', in The Complete Russian Folktale, 7 vols (Armonk, 1999-2006), II (1999): Russian Animal Tales, pp. xix-xliii (p. xxxi). 33 Recent work by folklorist Jack V. Haney supports Harrison's intuitions regarding the totemism underlying Russian animal tales. See, in particular, his remarks (in Russian Animal Tales, pp. xxx-xxxi, xxxvi-xxxvii) on three tales, one of which ('The Bear') also appears in 328</page><page sequence="16">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) produced books for a scholarly audience that made innovative use of evidence from ancient material culture. Now aiming for a much broader audience in response to a need she perceived in the younger generation, Harrison turned to folk literature. The two books framing Harrison's engagement with Russia, the Byliny Book and The Book of the Bear, are drawn from Russia's folk literature. The tales included in the Byliny Book share much with the ancient Greek texts she had examined for traces of earlier and underlying ritual practices. Beginning with Themis, Harrison had explicitly linked ancient Greek and Slavic ritual (folk) practice. Even more than byliny, the animal tales of The Book of the Bear brought a whiff of totemism back to the surface and into the present. The Book of the Bear contains twenty-one tales, 'newly translated from the Russian', the criterion for the selection of which is given in the epigraph to the Preface: 'The Bear is a shaggy, slothful, wild beast, in all respects like a man, and wishful to walk upright.' The tales feature bears expressive of the variety of human types, and several of them contain traces of the traditional Russian 'mythos' of human-bear kinship - the latter feature signalling Harrison's 'totemistic tendencies'. Yet it is the four tales by Remizov that exemplify the motivating impulse behind The Book of the Bear, and which drew the particular attention of its reviewers. R. D. Charques noted: It is impossible to summarize in a single statement the human likenesses and the infinite animal diversity of the bear in Russian literature . . . But the bears of Remizov are real bears, with 'the power of being so terribly unhappy,' but they have a life of their own and they adorn no human tale. We do not know how to describe Remizov' s genius for writing about animals ... It is certain that no other living writer has given us anything like 'Her Star-Bear,' 'The Bear's Lullaby,' 'The Hare as Nurse to the Bear-Cubs,' and 'Hare Ivanich.' These four very short stories are little masterpieces.34 Rather more predictably, perhaps, Mirsky singled out 'the inimitable animal tales of Remizov (which have hitherto remained unknown in this country)', suggesting that 'No more beautiful evocation of the finest flavour of the Russian skazka could be imagined.'35 The Book of the Bear.

Remizov's unusual ability to penetrate the spirit of folk material was widely acknowledged by Russian scholars, ethnographers, and literary critics; Harrison's selection of Remizov tales suggests that she was well aware of the significance of his work and how his interest in early Russian culture coincided with her own in early Greek religion. Indeed, working directly with Remizov, Harrison would have been aware of the relation between his tales and their sources and his qualifications as an interpreter of folk material. The Book of the Bear shares features with Posolon , which most likely grew out of their joint work. Both books were directed towards children, and their authors viewed the child's mind as a repository of older, less rational modes of consciousness. A second commonality is related to the calendrical structure of Posolon ' each of whose four sections is devoted to the successive seasons and their related customs and rituals - hence its title, which might be translated as With the Sun. As a whole, the composition replicates the calendrical ritual cycle.36 Remizov not only wrote certain of the texts during the calendar period to which it pertained, but placed the resulting texts specifically in issues of periodicals timed for such dates as the new year or Easter.37 Harrison would have appreciated Remizov's attention to what was, essentially, her own notion of the periodicity underlying religious festivals, something revealed, moreover, by the publication of The Book of the Bear in time for Christmas. Finally, the lullabies which frame Posolon' s tales suggest that the collection as a whole functions as a set of tales told to send a child to sleep and to dream.38 The most literary of Remizov's tales included in The Book of the Bear , 'Her Star-Bear', exemplifies the metamorphic imagination of a child, conforming to the trope common among modernists that the child's perception of the world is an analogue for the primitive mind. Charlotte Rosenthal summarizes the heroine's perceptions, for whom 'objects metamorphose into living creatures, and one creature into another: a fallen star into a bear cub, a bear cub into a cat'.39 Harrison 36 I.

The second Remizov tale in Harrison's collection is 'The Bear's Lullaby'. A facsimile of Remizov' s calligraphic autograph of the text appears on the facing page; his note, untranslated, identifies the source as a Latvian lullaby and explains that the text, including the transcribed melody, came to him in a dream while writing Posolon' In the preface, Harrison had written: 'A genuine folk- tale is like a dream ... a real dream, not a made up one. Oddly enough, the other great source of Remizov' s inspiration is dreams' (pp. x-xi). Harrison had identified Bergson's interior consciousness with dreams at least since valorizing the novel, Oblomov , for 'its dream-like duree' 40 By the 1920s, Harrison had also incorporated Freud and Jung's theories of dreams and consciousness into her understanding of the religious impulse; she cites both in the second chapter of the final volume of her trilogy on Greek religion, Epilegomena. For the third Remizov story, Harrison excerpted only that portion of 'The Hare as Nurse to the Bear-Cubs' which suited her purpose - providing the image of a bear 'in all respects like a man', in this case a 'widower' bear, needing a nurse to care for his cubs while he tends to the demands of daily life. The final selection in The Book of the Bear , Remizov' s 'Hare Ivanych', would not be catalogued as an animal tale; rather, it is a 'wondertale' (volshebnaia skazka, often translated into English as 'fairy tale'). In such tales, humans rather than animals are the principal actors; animals play subsidiary roles. The distinctive feature of the wondertale is physical, mental, or spiritual transformation of the principal character. The usually pubescent hero or heroine is sent into the world and transformed through testing; marriage - signifying entrance into the adult community - is the usual outcome. The plot of 'Hare Ivanych', like that of 'Beauty and the Beast', involves three daughters, the youngest of whom successfully passes the test of marriage to a beast. Testing would have been easily recognizable to Harrison as a form of ritual initiation ceremony, and 'Hare Ivanych' may have attracted Harrison for that reason, as well as for its allusion to human-bear kinship. Nonetheless, Harrison's choice of 'Hare Ivanych' 40 Harrison is likely to have known Bergson's 1901 lecture on dreams, first published in English translation in The Independent , 23 October 1913, pp. 160-3, and 30 October 1913, pp. 200-3, and in book form a year later.

Slobin, pp. 51-112. 331</page><page sequence="19">Marilyn Schwinn Smith/Jane Harrison as the crowning story in The Book of the Bear warrants some attention. She writes in the preface: The learned folklorist sees what lies behind his models - what they have forgotten. He has caught a glimpse of the splendour, the mana , that used to surround the bear in the days before St. Vladimir baptized Russia at the point of the sword, the days when the bear was still 'chiefest among ten thousand' and altogether lovely. Remizov's bear dies of grief, but before he does so, he thunders and lightens in the sky, and shakes the great forest to its foundation. (p. xii) The tale has been selected precisely because of the bear, rather than for its associations with initiation. Mana, we know from Themis, is that life force in which totemistic man is submerged. Harrison's identification of the end of totemism with the forced Christianization of Russia converges with Remizov's own paradigm for the devolution of native Russian culture. In 1915, Remizov described his ballet Rusaliia as the dance form that followed 'the establishment of the Christian faith in Rus', when all the idol gods dispersed to who knows where, like demons from the cross'.41 The bear's grief, though, is the more telling detail. According to Harrison's theory of totemistic epistemology, in the time before 'separation', when men and animals spoke the same language, language was 'holophrastic', based in emotion, rather than in reason, the language of separation. There is, perhaps, a single word in Harrison's preface that illuminates her choice of folktales to promote the dissemination of 'totemistic tendencies' in the modern world: Now, the sign-manual of a genuine folk-tale in its primitive state is that it has no moral, and this, perhaps, is one of the causes of its imbecility. For instance, could anything be more lacking in a moral and, honesty compels us to add, more imbecile, than the folk-tales included in this collection? (pp. x-xi)42 The word 'imbecile' at first startles, yet Harrison clearly chose it care- fully. Even at the time Harrison was writing, the word bore primarily a negative meaning of impairment and feebleness. Yet there once was a gentler use of the word as well, bearing the less judgemental sense of undeveloped mental faculties, or simply 'childishness': a 1911 41 'A.M. Remizov o svoei "Rusalii" ', Muzyka (Moscow, 1915), p. 226. 42 'Folk-tales included in this collection' refers to the four genuine folktales, as opposed to literary adaptations. 332</page><page sequence="20">Translation and Literature 20 (201 1) dictionary offers as one synonym 'dotage', meaning 'second childhood'.43 As Harrison had written to Mirsky: 'Knowing my totemistic tendencies you will not be surprised that we are writing a small book for children or persons in their dotage - to be called The Book of the Bear.' Clearly neither 'childhood', nor 'dotage', nor 'imbecile' was a pejorative term for Harrison. Rather, they bore those qualities of mind she valued: qualities of non-differentiation, of emotion, of non-judgement, the eradication of which is an explicit objective of 'education', which strives rather towards the development of mental faculties and the inculcation of reason. There is evidence that Harrison's efforts met with a response that would have gratified her. In December 1926 she reported to Remizov that The Book of the Bear was enjoying considerable success. Some of Remizov' s tales were shortly included in an anthology for schools, and Mirrlees was able to send Remizov a remittance she had received to cover the permission fee.44 The Book of the Bear was Harrison's answer to the wound of the Great War and to the wound she believed to afflict modern man - the break between human and animal, the break between man and the 'time which endures'. Re-imagining the Beast as totem and reuniting modern humans with the larger community that surrounded them, Harrison attempted to produce a marketable children's book that applied Bergsonian insights into the reflexivity of language and psychology to translation, translating not so much from language to language, but from one national psychology to another.
