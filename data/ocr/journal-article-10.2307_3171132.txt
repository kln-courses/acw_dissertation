If architecture is textual and texts are architectural, then the relation between text and building (or construction) is transformed. Or, more precisely, deformed. It is no longer a question of changing one form into another form, of revising or reforming. Rather, form itself must be interro- gated - as if from within. Text can no more explain architecture than architecture can exemplify text. The practices of explanation and exemplification remain bound to and by the economy of representation that has in-form- ed architecture since its beginning (which is not to say from its origin). When text no longer explains and con- struction no longer exemplifies, architecture becomes archetexture. Writing and construction become the same (without being the identical) textual practice. Text and building intersect in writing, which, though it is never about architecture, might be archetextural. The true world-we have abolished. What world has remained? The apparent one perhaps? But no! With the true world we have also abolished the apparent one.' I should tell you first that I am no longer interested in semiology. I am interested in poetics, and I think they are very different concerns. Equally, I am no longer interested in philosophy, but rather fiction. I think fiction is much more philosophical than philosophy. I do not have much relationship today with my ear- lier work dealing with syntax. I do not reject it or deny it. It is something else.2 In this abyssal palimpsest, no truth can establish itself on any principled presence or absolute meaning. In the labyrinth of this coral, the truth is the non-truth, the errancy of one of those 'errors' which belong to the title of another labyrinth, another palimpsest, another 'quarry.'3 How can one build in the shadow of the white light-noise of the bomb 74 Stories I have never known how to tell a story.5 I have always wondered why layers of a building are called stories. "Story" derives from the Latin historia (Greek, his- tor). "Story" and historia share the stem ueid, which means 8</page><page sequence="4">Taylor look at, see, object of vision. If one simply adds an h to ueid, the meaning changes significantly: u(e)idh, separate, whence divide, divisive, division. The origin of the word "story" to denote a layer of a building remains obscure. The architectural term probably derives from the use of the Latin historia to refer to a tier of painted windows or sculptures on the front of a building. Whether or not this etymology is correct, the intersection of narrative and architecture in "story" harbors a tale yet to be told - a tale that, when told in a certain way, tells the tolling of a very old story. In the last work that Nietzsche published, Twilight of the Idols or, How one Philosophizes with a Hammer, which appeared in January 1889, shortly after Nietzsche had slipped into total madness, he tells the story of "How the 'True World' Finally Became a Fable: The History of an Error." This story is inserted between two sections that indirectly recall Kant's division between the theoretical and practical dimensions of life: "'Reason' in Philosophy" and "Morality as Anti-Nature." The concluding sentences of the two preceding fragments echo throughout Nietzsche's story. I am afraid we are not rid of God because we still have faith in grammar. The tragic artist is no pessimist: he is precisely the one who says Yes to everything questionable, even the terrible - he is Dionysian. The story "proper" "ends" with a parenthetical aside. (Noon; moment of the briefest shadow; end of the longest error; high point of humanity; INCIPIT ZARATHUSTRA.)6 Associations, like Dionysus, run wild: God, grammar, Incipit Zarathustra, Incipit tragoedia,7' Dionysus. Dionysus is, of course, the Antichrist who declares the death of God, which marks the end of truth.8 In the wake of the tragic death of God, the "true world" can be recognized for what it has always been - a fable. While it took God six days to make, create, compose, or construct the (true) world, it takes Nietzsche only six brief "chapters" to unmake, uncreate, decompose, or deconstruct the (true) world. The story begins with "the true world - attainable for the sage" and ends with the abolition of truth. What had seemed to be the history of truth and the truth of history now appears to be the history of error and the error of history. "Truths," as Nietzsche explains elsewhere, "are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors that are worn out and without sen- suous power; coins that have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."9 The illusion of truth results from the failure to recognize its irreducibly fictive character. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche asks Indeed, what forces us to suppose that there is an essential oppo- sition of 'true' and 'false'? Is it not sufficient to assume degrees of apparentness and, as it were, lighter and darker shadows and shades of appearance - different 'values,' to use the language of painters? Why couldn't the world that concerns us - be a fic- tion? And if somebody asked, 'but to a fiction there surely belongs an author?' - couldn't one answer simply: why? Doesn't this 'belongs' perhaps belong to the fiction, too? Is it not permit- ted to be a bit ironical about the subject no less than the predi- cate and object? Shouldn't philosophers be permitted to rise above faith in grammar?10 Not only is the author a fiction, but the tale s/he tells is fictive. Nietzsche, or the fictive author bearing this name or pseudonym, cannot recount history truly or tell a true story. If truth is a fiction, which does not mean that fiction is true, then the story of truth's becoming a fable is not true. Nor, in a way yet to be determined, is it false. "The History of an Error" is itself an error. Nietzsche's errant story erases itself in and through its very inscription. Appearing by disappearing and disappearing by appearing, this impossible narrative about the impossibility of narra- tive enacts a terrifying fort/da that implies the approach of death. Peter Eisenman likes to tell a story, or so it seems, for he tells it repeatedly. Though he never does so, he might well entitle his favorite story "How 'True Form' Finally Became a Fable: The History of an Error." Eisenman's story, which has four rather than six chapters, is organized around the shifting relations of what Kant identifies as the three regu- lative ideas that guide all reflection: God, self, and world. The story of Western architecture is not continuous but punctuated by at least three ruptures. Prior to the fifteenth 9</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 11 century, God mediated between man and world, thereby establishing order and insuring meaning. Human thought and action sought to re-present the truth established by the divine architect of creation. With the Renaissance, anthro- pocentrism replaced theocentrism. Man became not only the measure but the center of all things: "Whereas the architecture of the theocentric world had been a celebra- tion of God, the anthropocentric world now celebrated man. The vertical datum - the wall, the hearth as a cen- ter, the chimney as a backbone - all began to be meta- phoric of man's vertebrate and upright stature, and architecture began to be scaled to man's bodily proportions rather than to some transcendent perfection. Architecture became anthropomorphic."" The third chapter in Eisen- man's story begins in the nineteenth and ends in the twen- tieth century. "With the advent of mass technology and the development of the relativistic human sciences - biology, sociology, psychology, and anthropology - man could no longer maintain his anthropocentric focus or take for granted his centric position and, correspondingly, the 'nat- uralness' of his social organizations. In the face of the rec- ognition of this fundamental human estrangement, man's sense of himself came into crisis.""2 Modern architecture arose in response to this crisis. Technology, the modernists believed, would make it possible to realize the utopian future that neither God nor man had delivered. But the dream of modernity was short-lived; it ended in a night- mare on 6 August 1945. While the tabula rasa of modernism was not thought to be man- centered, it was, ironically, willed by man; his mythic shadow loomed more importantly than had been realized. Then, in 1945, those shadows became frozen realities, marked forever on the consciousness of man in the stones of Hiroshima and the smoke of Auschwitz. While the ruptures of the Renaissance and modernism were created by man in the eclipse of history, the ruptures of 1945 were created by history in the eclipse of man."3 In the wake of the white light-noise of Hiroshima, it appears that the first three chapters in Eisenman's history, theocentrism, anthropocentrism, and technocentrism, are actually different versions of the same story - the story of classicism. Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, architecture, from its beginning through modernism, is essentially theological or, in Heidegger's terms, ontotheolog- ical. To see how this is so, it is necessary to return to Nietzsche's interpretation of the relation beween God and grammar by way of Derrida's account of the sign. In Of Grammatology Derrida writes, The sign and the divinity have the same place and time of birth. The age of the sign is essentially theological. Perhaps it will never end. Its historical closure is, however, outlined. 14 The age of the sign is theological insofar as the sign is understood in terms of the economy of representation within which a signifier re-presents a transcendental signi- fied that is antecedent to and the condition of the possibil- ity of signification. The transcendental signified is, in effect, the God-term that grounds the sign by securing its truth. Within the structure of re-presentation, the signified need not actually be God but can be a substitute for the divine as different as an empirical entity, ideal form, or a mental or linguistic structure. So understood, the grammar of the sign is overtly or covertly theological. The grammar of the sign embodied in the grammar of the world or "the order of things" is the result of divine creativity, which is actualized through the mediating agency of the Logos. As Nietzsche suggests, belief in grammar is a vestige of belief in God. Movements of thought from Platonism and Ger- man idealism to phenomenology and structuralism perpet- uate the logocentrism characteristic of ontotheology. In the realm of architecture, the theological age of the sign is coterminous with the history of classicism, which, according to Eisenman, extends through modernism. Clas- sicism is logocentric insofar as it continues to envision an originary type that constitutes the "truth" of the architec- tural object. The architectural object of both classicism and modernism con- tains the idea of original perfection. That is, the significance of any specific object is, in part, understood by some reference to simple type forms. The specific object does not so much repre- sent type forms as it is significant of this relationship. In the clas- sical, these type forms were ideal and 'natural,' characterized by symmetries, central axes, and a hierarchy of elemental parts. In the modern, type forms were platonic and abstract, characterized 10</page><page sequence="6">Taylor more easily by references to dynamic, asymmetric, mechanistic structures than the hierarchical types of the classical. Each pre- sumes that significance can inhere in an object and that such meaning accrues, at least in part, from the relationship of object to the type form. Thus, each assumes a stable origin of the object as sign; an ordering of signs which, as Foucault says, 'is a mirror to the ordering of the world and the order of being itself."' Signifier (building) signifies (type) in a mimetic relation whose telos is truth. What classicism fails or refuses to acknowledge is that true form or the transcendental signi- fied is really a fiction. While Nietzsche insists that truth is an illusion that has forgotten that it is an illusion, Eisen- man argues that "fiction becomes simulation when it does not recognize its condition as fiction, when it tries to sim- ulate a condition of reality, truth or non-fiction."'16 It is clear that Eisenman's early work remains with the classical epoch. His search for an essential architecture generated by an unauthored and self-contained transforma- tional process is thoroughly logocentric. Eisenman freely admits that "the search for essence and autonomy was no other than a search for an ultimate center and truth, and therefore contradictory to the effort to dislocate architecture from its metaphysics of center. . . . The attempt at auton- omy was a dream of illusory presence, the denial of absence, of the 'other.'"17 This project is not only anthro- pocentric, as Eisenman confesses, but is finally theocen- tric. Not until he gives up belief in God (or a certain God) by relinquishing faith in grammar can Eisenman begin to escape the confines of classicism. This move is mediated by his reading of deconstruction. On the brink of establishing his practice in 1982, Eisen- man opens a seminar at Yale by commenting, I should tell you first that I am no longer interested in semiology. I am interested in poetics, and I think they are very different concerns. Equally, I am no longer interested in philosophy, but rather fiction. I do not have much relationship today with my earlier work dealing with syntax. I do not reject or deny it. It merely is something else. 8 The shift from philosophy to fiction marks the transition from structuralism, which encompasses the entire Western tradition, to poststructuralism. Whereas classicism remains obsessed with the search for center, be that center God, man, or technology, poststructuralism is resolutely excen- tric/eccentric. By exposing the logocentrism within the Western tradition, poststructuralism creates the possibility of a postmodernism that, unlike classical postmodernism, is a subversion rather than an extension of modernism. According to Eisenman, "a true postmodern phenomenon would accept the lack of center, and not attempt to put hierarchy back together again. It would attempt to see things in a relativistic, nonsynthetic way: fragmentation, decomposition, not seeing the world as hierarchical. That, to me, is a cognitive structure of postmodernism."'9 From a poststructural or postmodern point of view, the story of architecture must be rewritten to tell "How 'True Form' Finally Became a Fable." This story is, of course, "The History of an Error." Form or structure, which had been believed to be temporally and ontologically anteced- ent to the material supplement, now is recognized as sec- ondary to what is secondary. Form, like everything else, is a supplement to a supplement. This play of supplements not only ungrounds truth but also recasts error. Eisenman contends that the simulation of reason in architecture has been based on a clas- sical value given to the idea of truth. But Heidegger has noted that error has a trajectory parallel to truth, that error can be the unfolding of truth. Thus to proceed from 'error' or fiction is to counter consciously the tradition of 'mis-reading' on which the classical unwittingly depended - not a presumedly logical trans- formation of something a priori, but a deliberate 'error' stated as such, one which presupposes only its own internal truth. Error in this case does not assume the same value as truth; it is not simply its dialectical opposite. It is more like a dissimulation, a 'not- containing' of the value of truth.20 A poststructuralist architecture will necessarily be both fic- tive and errant. Neither fiction nor error, however, can be understood as the binary or dialectical opposite of truth. As Nietzsche points out in the last chapter of his story, with the abolition of truth, its opposite also disappears: "The true world - we have abolished. What world has remained? The apparent one perhaps? But no! With the true world we have also abolished the apparent one."21 That which falls between truth and falsity is a fable. Rather than 11</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 11 telling a true story, fable "narrates" the impossibility of nar- rative, in a tale that is neither true nor false. To appreciate the significance or insignificance of fable, it is necessary to examine in more detail the event or nonevent in which classicism "ends" and postmodernism "begins." Disastrous Fable / Fabulous Disaster That unthinkable element offers itself to (be) thought in the age when a nuclear war is possible.22 The disaster ruins everything, all the while leaving everything intact. It does not touch anyone in particular; 'I' am not threat- ened by it, but spared, left aside. It is in this way that I am threatened; it is in this way that the disaster threatens in me that which is exterior to me - an other than I who passively become other. There is no reaching the disaster. Out of reach is he whom it threatens, whether from afar or close up, it is impossible to say: the infiniteness of the threat has in some way broken every limit. We are on the edge of disaster without being able to situate it in the future: it is rather always already past, and yet we are on the edge or under the threat, all formulations that would imply the future - that which is yet to come - if the disaster were not that which does not come, that which has put a stop to every arrival. 2 "... we are on the edge of disaster without being able to situate it in the future: it is rather always already past, and yet we are on the edge or under the threat . . ." Having always already arrived from an absolute past, a past that was never present, the disaster points toward an absolute future, a future that never arrives - that puts a stop to every arrival, thereby marking the absence in the midst of the present that renders presence impossible. Modernism, which is the last chapter of classicism, ended, as I have noted, on 6 August 1945. Hiroshima does not end modernism simply by destroying man's faith in the creative and redemptive power of technology. Classicism ends with the eruption of a radically new event that trans- forms the very nature of event itself. The explosion of the nuclear bomb harbors an event that is a nonevent - total nuclear war that ends in nuclear holocaust. This holocaust is the disaster that never has been or will be present. To claim that the disaster cannot be present is not to suggest that it is unreal. To the contrary, the disaster is the "real- ity" in whose shadow we are forever condemned to live. This "reality," however, forces us to reconsider the ways in which we have previously conceived reality. The reality of the disaster is fabulous. Exploring the implications of nuclear war, Derrida writes, Unlike the other wars which have all been preceded by wars of more or less the same type in human memory ..., nuclear war has no precedent. It has never occurred, itself; it is a non-event. The explosion of the American bombs in 1945 ended a 'classical,' conventional war; it did not set off a nuclear war. The terrifying reality of the nuclear conflict can only be the signified referent, never the real referent (present or past) of a discourse or a text. At least today apparently. And that sets us to thinking about today, our day, the presence of this present in and through that fabulous textuality. Better than ever and more than ever. The growing multiplication of the discourse - indeed, of the literature - on this subject may constitute a process of fearful domestication, the anticipatory assimilation of that unanticipatable wholly-other. For the moment, today, one may say that a non-localizable nuclear war has not occurred; it has existence only through what is said of it, only where it is talked about. Some might call it a fable, then, a pure invention: in this sense in which it is said that a myth, an image, a fiction, a utopia, a rhetorical figure, a fantasy, a phan- tasm are inventions.24 The invention of fable is not the creation of a fiction that opposes truth. Fable subverts rather than inverts the dis- course of truth and falsity and thus eludes the economy of representation. The referent (that is, the signified) does not exist prior to or independent of its "narration" but approaches (without ever arriving) in and through the pro- cess of fabulation. The "fabulous textuality" of fable inscribes an "event," which, since it is never present and yet is not absent, is in a certain sense a nonevent. In the course of his analysis of Ponge's poetry, Derrida clarifies this curious nonevent. This story remains a story without an event in the traditional sense of the word, the story of language and writing as the inscription of the thing itself as other [la chose mime en tant qu'autre] . . . , the paradigm of the thing itself as other thing, the other inaccessible thing, the impossible subject. The story of the sponge-towel . . . is indeed a fable, a story with the name of fiction, a simulacrum and effect of language (fabula), but such that only by means of it can the thing as other and as other thing 12</page><page sequence="8">Taylor come to pass with the allure of an inappropriable event (Ereignis in abyss). The fable of an allure (I give the name of 'allure' to an action of something that comes without coming, the thing that concerns this strange event) where nothing takes place except as it does in this little text.25 The strange "event" that comes without coming entails an equally strange temporality. Throughout the Western theo- logical, philosophical, and architectural tradition, time has been understood in terms of presence. While the present is always present to itself, the past is a past present and the future a future present. By putting a stop to all arriving, the "event" of nuclear holocaust is never present, though it is always approaching. The proximity of the disaster dislo- cates all presence and every present. As Blanchot explains in his extraordinary text Le pas au-deld, Time, time: the step/not beyond [le pas au-delc], which is not accomplished in time, would lead outside of time, without this outside being timeless, but there where time would fall, fragile fall, according to this 'outside of time in time' toward which writ- ing would draw us, if it were permitted of us, vanished from us, from writing the secret of the ancient fear.26 If the task of thinking at the end of philosophy is to think the k/not of time,27 the task of building at the end of archi- tecture is to build the k/not of time. The k/not of time - the "outside of time in time" - is the impossibility of presence/present. It is toward this impossibility that writing draws us. If architecture is to build the k/not of time, it must, as Eisenman realizes, become scriptural or textual. To escape the classical economy, architecture must move toward what Jeffrey Kipnis describes as "a timeful alterna- tive to the futility of architecture's pursuit of the time- less."28 Paradoxically, the fullness of time implies an irreducible emptiness that is a function of the endless deferral of presence. The dilemma facing the poststructuralist architect is how to insert temporality into buildings otherwise than as sim- ple presence or mere absence. This is the task Eisenman undertakes in his most recent and most innovative work. The question of how time could be introduced into architecture itself, rather than merely as the experience of our response to architecture, remained unanswered. Architecture, because it was thought to have the single temporal dimension of the now, and because the static object of architecture was incapable of display- ing a multivalent time, was thought not to be textual. However, architecture as text does not reside in the aesthetic or functional presence of the object, but rather as a state of between. There- fore, textual time can be introduced into architecture to produce an architecture which dislocates not only the memory of internal time but all the aspects of presence, origin, scale, and so forth.29 The "space-between" is the time of diffgrance. Diffrance marks the endless interplay of time and space by remarking a timing that is a spacing and a spacing that is a timing. Constituting itself, dynamically dividing itself, this interval is what could be called spacing; time's becoming-spatial or space's becoming-temporal (temporalizing). And it is this constitution of the present as a 'primordial' and irreducibly nonsimple, and, therefore, in the strict sense nonprimordial, synthesis of traces, retentions, and protensions (to reproduce here analogically and provisionally, a phenomenological and transcendental language that will presently be revealed as inadequate) that I propose to call protowriting, prototrace, or diffirance. The latter (is) (both) spac- ing (and) temporalizing.30 Architecture becomes scriptural or textual when it figures the unfigurable in the spacing-timing of a between that is neither present nor absent, neither presence nor absence. The "nonabsent absence" of this neither/nor is the gap that faults modernism and opens the space and time of decon- structive archetexture. This gap gapes in Eisenman's Romeo and Juliet project. Through the strategy of superim- posing discontinuous scales, Eisenman creates an unset- tling space in which presence is dislocated by a fictive past and fabulous future. He insists that here for the first time there was a text of between; a fabric of images referring to something other than itself in order to create a dislocation in time and space. Traditional textuality (which includes the modernist idea of dispersal, incongruity and frag- ment) is ultimately projected to return the system to closure. The textuality of the Romeo and Juliet project is as a set of fragments which are internally incomplete. They signal the impossibility of a return to more traditional forms of text in architecture such as the relationship of form to type or form to man.31 13</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 11 For those without proper sensibilities, for those who (obses- sively) observe the rules of propriety, Eisenman's gaping architecture - like all such gaps - is grotesque. But what is (the) grotesque? And what is the "other" that haunts the fabric of traces written "in" deconstructive construction? Does this grotesque other have anything to do with a tomb or crypt - perhaps the tomb or crypt where eros and than- atos intersect in Juliet's rotting corpse? The Grotesque Body of Displaced Archetexture The corpse (or cadaver: cadere, to fall), that which has irremedia- bly fallen, cesspool, upsets even more violently the identity of the one who confronts it as fragile and fallacious chance. A wound with blood and pus, or the sickly, acrid odor of sweat, or decay, does not signify death. In front of signified death - for instance, a flat encephalograph - I would understand, react, or accept. No, as in true theater, without makeup or masks, waste and corpses indicate to me what I permanently thrust aside in order to live. These humors, this defilement, this shit are what life with- stands, hardly and with difficulty on the part of death. From these limits my body is disengaged as living."2 What is a crypt? No crypt presents itself. The grounds are so disposed as to disguise and to hide: something, always a body in some way. But also to disguise the act of hiding and to hide the disguise: the crypt hides as it holds. Carved out of nature, some- times making use of probability or facts, these grounds are not natural. A crypt is never natural through and through, and if, as is well known, physics has a tendency to encrypt (itself), that is because it overflows its own bounds and encloses, naturally, its other, all others. The crypt is thus not a natural place, but the striking history of an artifice, an architecture, an artifact: of a place comprehended within another but rigorously separate from it, isolated from general space by partitions, an enclosure, an enclave. So as to purloin the thing from the rest. Constructing a system of partitions, with their inner and outer surfaces, the cryp- tic enclave produces a cleft in space, in the assembled system of various places, in the architectonics of the open square within space, itself delimited by a generalized closure, in the forum.33 The grotesque is excessive; it cannot be contained, con- trolled, or mastered. The site of excess is the boundary, margin, or limen - the point or nonpoint that is neither inside nor outside but is the difference between the two. In the course of analyzing the writings of Rabelais, Bakhtin offers a concise description of the grotesque body. Contrary to modern canons, the grotesque body is not separated from the rest of the world. It is not a closed, complete unit; it is unfinished, outgrows itself, transgresses its own limits. The stress is laid on those parts of the body that are open to the outside world, that is, the parts through which the world enters the body or emerges from it, or through which the body itself goes out to meet the world. This means that the emphasis is on the apertures or the convexities, or the various ramifications and offshoots: the open mouth, the genital organs, the breasts, the phallus, the pot- belly, the nose." So understood, the grotesque embodies the inside-out/ outside-in structure of invagination. Bataille elaborates this strange structure when he contends that man is "a tube with two orifices, anal and buccal: the nostrils, the eyes, the ears, the brain represent the complications of the buc- cal orifice; the penis, the testicles, or the female organs that correspond to them, are the complications of the anal.""35 Mouth and anus, eye and ear, penis and vulva are marginal sites of passage that call into question hard-and- fast distinctions between interiority and exteriority. Are eye and ear, mouth and esophagus, anus and intestine, penis and testicles, vulva and uterus inside or outside? The chiasmic body cannot be articulated in terms of the binary opposites that structure thought and language. Never "proper, clean, neat or tidy," the grotesque body is inescap- ably transgressive. The transgression of the grotesque is inscribed in objects that are transitional. Such "objects" are not really objects in the strict sense of the word, for they do not stand over against (Gegen-stand) a subject. The liminality of the tran- sitional "object" eludes clear conceptualization and classifi- cation. The grotesque upsets thought by dislocating its structure. While the logic of reflection tends to be either Aristotelian (either/or) or dialectical (both/and), the gro- tesque involves the nonlogic of neither/nor. Neither inside nor outside but inside-out and outside-in: shit, piss, spit, vomit, blood, sperm, and, perhaps most grotesque of all, a corpse - a rotting corpse. The corpse is the paradigmatic transitional object. As the point at which eros and thanatos intersect, the corpse is neither merely living nor dead. The stench of decay, which is the smell of death, is at the same time the sweet 14</page><page sequence="10">Taylor aroma of life renewing itself. An unassimilable "remain- der," the corpse is a grotesque monstrosity that is disgusting yet strangely fascinating and attractive. The place of the corpse is, of course, the grotto (whence "grotesque"), crypt, or tomb. The tomb, like the grotesque body, is invagin- ated. Neither inside nor outside, the tomb hollows out "mother" earth as if from within. Eros and thanatos min- gle in the bowels of mat(t)er. The atopos of death is "the cryptic enclave [that] produces a cleft in space." This cleft is nothing other than the "space-between" that marks the endless interplay of time and space by remarking a timing that is a spacing and a spacing that is a timing. To explore this crypt is to return - albeit differently - to the "origin of the work of art." Art originates in a cleft, grotto or cave. As Bataille points out in Lascaux or the Birth of Art, art is first inscribed on the invaginated intestinal walls of mother earth. From the beginning (if indeed there is a beginning), there is some- thing grotto-esque and dirty about art. Bataille is convinced that the dirt of art's grotesque "origin" can never be wiped away. Ever grotesque, art is always excessive. A work of art, a sacrifice . . . , participate in the spirit of the festival overflowing the world of work, and clash with the spirit, if not the letter, of the prohibitions necessary for the protection of this world.36 The "origin" of the work of art is no ordinary origin that took place "once upon a time" but rather a "nonoriginal origin" that abides in and through its withdrawal. In an essay entitled "The Origin of the Work of Art," Heidegger explains that "a construction, a Greek temple, images nothing. It simply stands in the midst of a rock-cleft valley [zer-klift-eten Felsentales]." The temple images nothing by holding open the differential gap of the space-between. Standing there, the construction rests on rocky ground. This rest- ing of the work draw up out of the rock the obscurity of the rock's monstrous yet spontaneous support. Standing there, the construc- tion holds its ground against the storm raging above it and so makes the storm itself manifest in its violence. The luster and gleam of the stone, though itself apparently glowing by grace of the sun, yet first bring to light the light of the day, the breadth of the sky, the darkness of the night. The secure tower makes visible the invisible space of air. The steadfastness of the work contrasts with the surge of the surf, and its own repose brings out the raging of the sea. Tree and grass, eagle and bull, snake and cricket first enter into their distinctive forms and thus come to appear as what they are.37 Neither eagle nor bull, tree nor grass, snake nor cricket is original, for each arises in and through the work of art. The origin of art is an "original" gap that makes possible all such paired opposites. The work of art works by open- ing this opening. This opening is the gap that faults onto- theology and marks the closure of its architecture. If architecture is to become what Eisenman describes as "not-classical," it must become grotesque. In other words, if architecture is to work, it must open opening by sus- pending construction in the irrepressible space-time- between. In a recent article entitled "En Terror Firma: In Trails of Grotextes," Eisenman approaches the grotesque by way of Kant's interpretation of the sublime. The sub- lime erupts along what Eisenman describes as "The Edge of Between." As is well known, Kant, in Critique of Judg- ment, distinguishes the sublime from the beautiful. While the beautiful presupposes inner harmony that is experi- enced as pleasure, the sublime interrupts harmonious auto- affection and issues in what Kant describes alternatively as "a negative pleasure" or "a feeling of displeasure, arising from the inadequacy of the imagination." The pleasure of beauty derives from the harmony between the form of an object apprehended by the imagination and the under- standing. The sublime, by contrast, exceeds every form and escapes all formation. Whereas the presentation of form to understanding in the judgment of beauty reveals the unity of intuition, imagination, and understanding, the presenta- tion of unlimitedness to reason in the judgment of sublim- ity discloses differences among intuition, imagination, and reason. Kant explores these differences through a consider- ation of two modalities of the sublime: mathematical and dynamic. The sublime approaches at the limits of human conscious- ness. Indeed, the sublime might be understood as the experience of limit as such - if, that is, limit as such could be experienced. Paradoxically, limit is encountered in and through the irreducible excess of the unlimited. The two modalities of the sublime correspond to two 15</page><page sequence="11">assemblage 11 orders of excess: magnitude, the mathematical sublime, and power, the dynamic sublime. The mathematical sublime marks the boundary between reason's demand for totality and the imagination's inability to deliver it. In seeking to satisfy reason's quest for "abso- lute totality," the mind is "pushed to the point at which our faculty of imagination breaks down in presenting the concept of a magnitude, and proves unequal to the task."'38 Since the synthesis of the imagination remains incomplete, the totality of reason is repeatedly deferred. Something can be de trop not only because of its excessive magnitude but because of its excessive power. Anticipating the romantic preoccupation with nature, Kant argues that the dynamic sublime is encountered in the overwhelming power of nature. As in the case of the mathematical sub- lime, reason demands a totality the imagination cannot deliver. Rather than an endless series of forms, the dynamic sublime exceeds all form. "In both types of judg- ments of the sublime," John Sallis explains, "the appre- hensive moment is thus found to issue in the disclosure of a certain difference. This disclosure is the site of the sub- lime, its site within experience, within the subject."" 39 The difference marked by the sublime cannot be reduced to identity or unity. In the uncanny space of this site, which, as I have noted, is also a strange time, understanding and reason are checked and held in suspense. In relation to the sublime, the imagination is not synthetic. Instead of recon- ciling or uniting opposites, the imagination constantly alternates, oscillates, or hovers between differences it simultaneously brings together and holds apart. Rapidly alternating between opposites it cannot unite, the imagina- tion creates a sense of vertigo - as if the foundation were shaking, cracking, tearing, as if the ground were falling from beneath one's feet. And yet when one attempts to define the sublime that sets the mind spinning, words fail. The sublime is unrepresentable and thus eludes or over- flows the economy of representation. Forever unrepresent- able, the sublime is never present; never present, the sublime is unrepresentable. If the sublime approaches, which is not to say arrives, it is at the limit, edge, margin, border of form - "in" the gaps, fissures, faults, tears of structure. In order to figure the tears of structure that fall along the edge of between, architecture, according to Eisenman, must "displace the former ways of conceptualizing itself. "40 If successful, this displacement would issue in construc- tions that are irreducibly uncertain. Eisenman identifies four conditions of displacement, three of which are equiva- lent in this context. First, displaced architecture is textual. As such, architec- ture is never original but is always secondary. The belated- ness of architecture marks its unavoidable implication with a certain otherness. An example of this condition of otherness in architecture is a trace. If architecture is primarily presence - materiality, bricks and mortar - then otherness or secondarity would be a trace, as the presence of absence. Trace can never be original, because trace always suggests the possibility of something other as original, as something prior to.4' Inasmuch as the architectural text always marks the pres- ence of the absence of an original text, the trace is forever haunted by an altarity it cannot control. This otherness displaces the architectural object by rendering its irreduci- bly duplicitous. Second, grotesque architecture involves "betweenness." Indirectly echoing Vattimo's "weak thought," Eisenman argues that betweenness suggests a condition of the object as a weak image. A strong image would give a primary dominant meaning to one or the other of the two texts. Not only must one or the other of the two texts have a strong image; they will seem to be two weak images, which suggests a blurred third. In other words, the new condition of the object must be between in an image-able sense as well: It is something which is almost this, or almost that, but not quite either. The displacing experience is the uncertainty of a partial knowing. Therefore, the object must have a blurring effect. It must look out of focus: almost seen, but not quite.42 ". .. almost this . . . almost that . . . not quite either . .." The blurred third of the between is the neither/nor that is disastrous for both Aristotelian and Hegelian logic. The between is the margin of difference that marks the limit of knowledge. Forever slipping away from the grasp of reason, "this between is not a between dialectically, but 16</page><page sequence="12">Taylor a between within." This "withinness" points to the final distinguishing trait of the inscription of the grotesque. Displaced architecture marks and remarks a strange 'interiority.' Interiority has nothing to do with the inside or the inhabitable space of a building but rather of a condition of being within. However, as is the case with the grotesque, interiority deals with two factors; the unseen and the hollowed-out.43 The interiority that displaces is not simply within but is a certain outside that is inside, thereby hollowing out every structure as if from within. The space of this interior is not the heimlich space of the home but the unheimlich spacing of the crypt. Producing "a cleft in space," "the cryptic enclave" transforms terra firma into terror firma. Since it is never present, that which provokes this terror is forever "unseen." In this unseen, the grotesque and the sublime intersect. The terrifying between is not only unseeable; it is also unspeakable. The beauty of classical architecture is con- structed to repress "the negative pleasure" of terror. Now, interestingly, the sublime also has within it a condition which the conventionally beautiful represses. It is a condition of the uncertain, the unspeakable, the unnatural, the unpresent, the unphysical; taken together these constitute the condition which approaches the terrifying, a condition which lies within the sublime. 44 The grotesque body of displaced architecture is sublime. The sublime, in turn, is uncertain, unpresent, unseeable, unspeakable. The trail of Eisenman's grotextes leads to an unspeakable point - the point of the unsayable. The unsayable settles us in those desert regions which are the home of dead languages. Here, every grain of sand stifled by the mute word offers the dreary spectacle of a root of eternity ground to dust before it could sprout. In the old days, the ocean would have cra- dled it. Does the void torment the universe, and the universe in turn vex the void? Roots buried in sand keep longing for their trees. The deepest weep for their fruit. They are reborn of their tears. 45 Tears. Tears. To write by renouncing speech. To build by renouncing dwelling. What's the point? What's a point? He never speaks of the point. He never speaks to the point. Rather, he speaks of and to the point by not speaking of or to the point. Is there any other way? (E)L EL LE L Stages of experience from fore-book to absent book.46 One crack, and the building crumbles and initiates the endless reading of its ruins.47 I end (or rather resist ending) not with a conclusion but with a detail - a detail that is suspended above a thresh- old and is supposed to open doors. It is a door handle in the shape of an L, or more precisely, in the shape of three L's that intersect in a point above a keyhole. The L is repeated many times on the plate supporting the handle. Once recognized, the L appears everywhere in Eisenman's work - early as well as late, in drawings as well as in buildings. Every house, which is not a home, is, in effect, "House El." And yet Eisenman never talks or writes about the significance or insignificance of L . . . El . . . Elle. It is as if the letter (if it is a letter) were unpronounceable, unspeakable. Why? How is (E)L to be read? Is it the key that opens Eisenman's cryptic archetexture or is it the crypt around which Eisenman writes, draws, and builds? What is El? Who is El? El, the head of the Canaanite pantheon, was the creator and father of the other gods. It appears that El was some- thing of an architect, for one of his most common epithets in Ugaritic literature is "Builder of Things Built." El, architect of the universe, had a Dionysian streak that sometimes led to grotesque excess. In one ancient text, he "is portrayed as drinking himself into a stupor and wallow- ing in his own excrement and urine."48 Philo of Byblos (ca. A.D. 64-141), a Greek historian, identified El with Kronos - the same Kronos with whom Derrida associates Dionysus whose "bacchanalian revel" disrupts rather than realizes absolute knowledge.49 The remain(s) of time undecides itself between the three and the more-than-three, the fulfillment of the emptying out of significa- 17</page><page sequence="13">assemblage 11 18</page><page sequence="14">Taylor tion. Sa suffers the indecision and in that tries to find its rhythm again and as a return of seasons. One could speak as well - the two words are closely related - of Sa's saturnalia. Feasts in honor of Saturn: the Italic god had been identified with Kronos (an empty play on words, and this was the time - that one would come here to feast as Sa). He is said to have taken refuge in Italy after his son had dethroned and thrown him down from the top of Olympus. He had himself sliced off the testicles of his father with the aid of his mother, Gaia. Again it is Gaia, she already, who put the sickle between her son's hands. Perhaps it is she, again, who allied herself with Zeus, her grandson, against Kronos, her son, and made him take a pharmakon that forced him to vomit all the children he had eaten. So Saturn would be a deposed father whose Latin reign had nevertheless left the memory of a mythic golden age. He had become the god of agriculture, and more precisely, armed with a sickle and billhook, he used to preside at the pruning of the vine. Like Dionysus- Bacchus, he was intimately bound up with wine. He would also be considered the god of the underworld. 50 El ... Kronos ... Dionysus-Bacchus. Perhaps the underworld of the gods is Bataille's cave - the grotto or crypt that is the nonoriginal origin of the work of art. Per- haps the festival held in this grotto honors Dionysus - the Antichrist whose "gay science" displays the true world as fable. Perhaps. El is also the "name" of YHWH. Though usually hostile to Canaanite gods and goddesses, Israel identified YHWH as El. "El" is, then, a substitute for "YHWH." But "YHWH" is itself a substitute for the ineffable name of God. As a substitute for a substitute, El "names" that which is absolutely unnameable. Another "name" for this unnameable is diffrrance, which, we have seen, the decon- structive archetect struggles to construct. 'Older' than Being itself, such a diff.rance has no name in our language. But we 'already know' that if it is unnameable, it is not provisionally so, not because our language has not yet found or received this name, or because we would have to seek it in another language, outside the finite system of our own. It is rather because there is no name for it at all, not even the name of essence or of Being, not even that of 'diff.rance,' which is not a name, which is not a pure nominal unity, and unceasingly dislocates itself in a chain of differing and deferring substitutions. 51 A final point . . the point itself. . . which is, perhaps, the point of Eisenman's archetexture. Three (E)l's intersect at a point above a keyhole to form the handle to a door. How can we get a handle on this point? Where is the point? What is the point? The point of textual or scriptural archetexture? (Everything is washed away. Only the point is left, arbiter of obliteration.) ... He spoke of the point and the one who was paying attention rubbed his eyes to cast out the night.52 Perhaps there is no point . . no point other than the point . . the point that is never present . . without being absent . . the point that can never appear . . . or appears only by disappearing. Questioning the point meant unflagging questioning of the ques- tion that had come up with it. Unassailable point, favorable and fatal to all thought - fighting with its own excess - for which it is crest and base.53 tsimtsum 6 August 1988 43rd Anniversary of the Bombing of Hiroshima 19</page><page sequence="15">assemblage 11 Notes Titles (tel, ground, floor; tellus, earth; titulus, first.. .) - like ori- gins, first principles, and founda- tions - have become impossible. No longer am I certain how to title the works I write or that are written in "my" name. And yet editors (and readers) want, indeed demand a title. I can neither meet this need nor fulfill this desire. In the absence of a title, the best I can do is to offer an incomplete list of alternatives. I am sure I will think of others. You, dear reader (this is also a letter, a missive, whether or not it arrives), are free to choose from the suggested titles or to invent your own. It makes little dif- ference - little difference that is perhaps the only difference that is different. It is always possible that we never advance beyond the impossibility of a title and that this impossibility is nothing other than the impossibility of architecture. "... (because to give a title was also a way not to sign while we were signing), and at the same time, it opens up the whole to which it seems to belong. Thus there is no principle role to be played by this title, itself open to other interpretations or, one might say, other performances, other musicians, other choreographers, or even other voices. Totalization is impossible" (Derrida). 1. Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, in The Portable Nietzsche, trans. and ed. Walter Kaufmann (New York: Viking Press, 1968), 486. 2.

Compare Blanchot's comment: "The name of God signifies not only that what is named by it would not belong to the language in which this name occurs, but that this name, in a way that is difficult to determine, would no longer be a part of it, even apart from it. The idolatry of the name or only the reverence that makes it unpro- nounceable (sacred) is related to this disappearance of the name that the name itself makes appear and that forces us to raise the level of the language in which it occults itself to the point of giving it as forbidden. Far from raising us to lofty signifi- cations, as those that theology authorizes, it does not give place to anything that is its own: pure name that does not name, but rather is always to be named, the name as name, but, in that, hardly a name, without nominative power, attached as it is by chance to language and, thus, transmitting to it the power - devastating - of non-designation that relates to itself" (Le pas au- del, 69-70). 52.
