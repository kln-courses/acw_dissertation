<plain_text><page sequence="1">HIDDEN THEMES IN THE FRONTIER THESIS: AN APPLICATION OF PSYCHOANALYSIS TO HISTORIOGRAPHY In 1957, when William Langer called the attention of professional historians to the "urgently needed deepening of ... historical understanding" by means of the application of modem psychoanalytic theory to the problems of history, he seemed to have in mind the use of these constructs in the writing of biography and for the analysis of obviously irrational movements.' In half praise, a critic found it interesting that this suggestion was not extended to the "study of the psychic foundations of civilization and the historical process as a whole".2 While encompassing less grand designs than these in this paper, I would like to add a further, but simpler, extension of my own. I would like to use psychoanalytic understanding in an attempt to shed light upon some aspects of a well-known problem in American historiography, the frontier thesis of Frederick Jackson Turner. The initial widespread appeal of the frontier hypothesis is well known. Equally well known is the fact that the thesis is not as valid as it first seemed to be. However, in spite of a wealth of criticism adverse to the Turner thesis, it is still a popular theme. The initial, as well as continuing, appeal must be explained. Here, individual depth psychology can add light where other explanations fail. This is not to exclude the others, it is only to add a new dimension which may give further understanding. The great appeal of the Turner thesis, it seems to me, comes from the fact that it depicts a universal problem that each person in his individual develop- ment attempts to solve. Since man gets some relief from his inner tensions by seeing on the outside similar problems which others, more or less, seemed to have solved, it may be anticipated that prose, poetry, and even historical I William L.

BECKMAN writings that contain symbolically depicted psychic themes of a universal nature will be popular. Slightly more than seventy years have passed since Turner read his famous paper in which he declared that "the existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of the American settlement westward, explain American development". From the time he delivered his momentous essay in 1893, until the early 1930's, Turner's theoretical statement dominated American historical writing and his ideas went virtually unchallenged.3 Seventy years after its appearance, another historian would write, "no man shaped twentieth-century histories of the United States as much as Turner did".4 So well recognized was this fact that the Council of the American Historical Association selected Turner as one of the two most eminent American historians.5 The wealth of articles written by Turner's students and associates attest that Turner was also warmly respected and much admired as both man and teacher.6 For almost forty years the Turner thesis was considered valid. Yet, follow- ing Turner's death, in 1932, criticisms centered around the "safety valve theory", the idea that "whenever capital tended to press upon labor or political restraints to impede the freedom of the mass, there was this gate of escape to the free conditions of the frontier". Moreover, "men would not accept inferior wages and a permanent position of social subordination when this promised land .., was theirs for the taking".7 Goodrich and Davison in their early study noted the paucity of concrete examples of a movement of workers West and cast doubt about the direct and literal form in which the doctrine had been stated by Turner and his followers, although they felt that if the doctrine were true it would go a long way "toward explaining the 3 Louis Hacker, "Section or Classes", in George R.

And "too few left the industrial centers to exert any marked effect on their labor situation". In- dustrial workers who did take up land, more frequently than not appeared to "have failed and returned home". While they did not feel that their study cast doubt upon the "doctrine that the growth of American industrialism was delayed and made difficult by the presence of the frontier alternative", Goodrich and Davison did see the safety valve as being the "farmer's rather than the worker's" - Western lands drew away potential urban immigrants from exhausted farms - and this tended to hold up the level of industrial wages. They added a scoring statement, "if the American wage-earner... did, in fact, have broader opportunities ... it would appear that more of an explanation lies in the rapid (industrial) growth. . . than in the presence of a distant frontier".9 Using material from the panic of 1837, Murray Kane tested the idea that "free land acted as a safety-valve in times of depression and panic".10 He noted that laborers could not accumulate capital to take up land on the frontier.1" For the most part, he found, migration to the West was more rapid during periods of prosperity, reaching its peak just prior to the panic and contracting during the depression.'2 Kane then drew a distinction which took an aspect of the safety-valve doctrine out of the reach of practical testing and placed it in the realn of ideas men live by: As an ideological factor, the frontier influenced every political faith of note, penetrated deeply into the roots of all labor philosophies, and acted as a psy- chological vent for the dissatisfactions of the immobile populations of the city.13 It was probably so, but why? A defender did present additional "bits of evidence" from which he would not contend to prove the "affirmative of the safety-valve theory" but merely "to show that the negative ought not be assumed lightly".'4 He concluded, however, that he "could not be certain that very large numbers of actual industrial wage earners passed from the eastern cities to the frontier at any given time".'5 8 C.

BECKMAN Taking up the scalpel of an historical pathologist, Shannon conducted "a post mortem on the safety-valve theory"."6 He found that for every worker who took up land, at least twenty farmers moved to the city and for every farmer's son who became the owner of a new farm, ten sons of farmers went to the towns and cities.17 But, Shannon went on, "there never was a freeland or even a western safety-valve for industrial labor"; rapid commercial and industrial growth "provided a release from surplus farm population".'8 Con- cluding the autopsy, Shannon brought in the verdict: "Death came from inanition." The body may now be sealed in its coffin and laid to rest. Let those who will consult the spirit rappers to bring forth its ghost.19 Nevertheless, seventeen years after the final interment, a necromancer ap- peared and decided that Shannon had merely decapitated several heads of a theoretical hydra.20 After reviewing the remains, however, von Nardroff concluded "that the actual or direct safety valve defined as a movement of laborers to farms was a ridiculous idea". In addition, the potential safety valve "only partially illuminates the phenomena it was designed to explain".2' Being mere poseurs, these safety-valves required no reinterment, only defenestration.22 The real safety-valve had to do with a higher wage level and a social outlook contributed to by the process of developing a virgin area.23 Others attacked many parts of the thesis.24 Turner was charged with giving American history a "perverted reading" by insisting on the uniqueness of American experience while neglecting the "study of the origins and growth of American capitalism and imperialism".25 James Malin felt that Turner was caught in a closed-space dilemma; since the disappearance of the frontier would impair or destroy the very values it had produced and protected.26 The almost uncritical acceptance of the Turner thesis, Malin felt, was due either to the backwardness of geography as a discipline in the United States 16 Fred A.

BECKMAN In 1941, Pierson tried to make a statistical measure; the 106 replies to his inquiries indicated that the "champions and believers" (of Turner) "still clearly outnumber the critics".39 More than twenty years later, another sta- tistical surveyer on the basis of 285 responses would find that the "ideas of Turner and the pro-Turnerians are still dominant".40 However, he thought that it was only a matter of time until the "anti-, un-, and non-Turnerian group... attain a majority status".4' Merle Curti, who at one time, as an admiring student of Turner, wrote that Turner's range of interests was so broad that the history of the frontier "was the history of the country", thirty years later would conclude: It seems clear that in its extreme form, the frontier thesis is no longer tenable and that more exact analysis and definition are needed. But the last word has not been said.42 What accounts for the popularity of the thesis? In view of all the refutation of Turner's writings it is difficult to answer this major question. Hofstadter talks of the popularity of the thesis as resting upon "the appeal of the frontier to the American imagination" and uses as part of his title "the frontier myth".43 Wright calls Turner's concept of the "transforming influences" of the frontier "largely a myth" and describes Turner as a poet who wrote odes to the Westward movement.44 Pierson suggests Turner's essays appealed to "emotions and conviction widely cherished by Americans in general".45 Perhaps the influence of the frontier, although modest and limited, was real; but "at a favorable moment in our emotional development" it was "magnified into a legend".46 Or, "perhaps, the frontier hypothesis gave expression in some mysterious fashion to ancient and powerful beliefs".47 And, in discussing the ancestry of Turner's ideas and Turner's indebtedness to others, Pierson wonders if the significance of these widely shared ideas lay "in their general bearing on our (page 90), although he realized that before a restatemiient or reappraisal could be made, contradictory elements needed untangling and ambiguities had to be removed (page viii). 39 George W.

In all these comments is the idea that the hypothesis contains the elements of a folktale, of a legend, or of a myth. Would it be possible, if one were to examine the Turner thesis as if it were a myth, that this departure would give insight into the great popularity of the hypothesis? Suppose we are to deal with the frontier thesis as a myth, who are the dramatis personae of the frontier myth? There is a cast of three: the frontier, sometimes called the West; the frontiersman, collectively called the West; and the East, also known as government, European influence, or Europe. Pierson noted that the term "frontier seems to have symbolized for Turner an anthropogeographic situa- tion of a special and highly significant sort".50 To carry this idea a step further, Turner's frontier, and Turner's East were anthropomorphisms. Turner ascribed to the frontier the function of acculturating individuals. Excerpts from Turner's essays will give additional credence to this idea. Henry Adams in his history of the United States, makes the American of 1800 exclaim to the foreign visitor, "Look at my Wealth! See these solid mountains of salt and iron, of lead, copper, silver, and gold. See these magnificent cities .. See my cornfield rustling. Look at this continent of mine, fairest of created worlds, as she lies turning up to the sun's never failing caress her broad and exuberant breasts overflowing with milk for her hundred million children." 51 European men, institutions, and ideas were lodged in the American wilderness, and this great American West took them to her bosom, taught them a new way of looking upon the destiny of the common man, trained them in adaptation to the conditions of the New World to the creation of new institutions to meet new needs; . .,52 She gave to the world such types as the farmer Thomas Jefferson ... She gave us Andrew Jackson ... She gave us Abraham Lincoln ... She has furnished to this new democracy her stores of mineral wealth ...

BECKMAN measure of his capacity. Great and powerful as are the new sons of her loins, the Republic is greater than they.53 The Western wilds, ... constituted the richest free gift that was ever spread out before civilized man . .. The West offered an exit into a free life and greater well-being among the bounties of nature, into the midst of resources that demand- ed manly exertion, and that gave in return the chance for indefinite ascent in the scale of social advance. "To each she offered gifts after his will." Never again can such an opportunity come to the sons of man. It was unique, and the thing is so near us, so much a part of our lives, that we do not even yet comprehend its full significance.54 The anthropomorphic attributes of the frontier are more apparent. The frontier is likened to a human, a mother, and the natural resources of the frontier are described in human terms, milk. The frontier as mother takes her children "to her bosom". She teaches them a new way of looking upon their destiny and trains them to adapt. Moreover, the frontier is seen as a mother who bears sons who are great and powerful. To these sons she gives her bounty, so much so that they become able, even "alarming", competitors. She inspires her sons with hope, with faith, and with the will and the power to grow to the full measure of their capacity. So great, in fact, were her bounties, so unique, in spirit, were her influences; so much were these a part of her children's life; that, even yet, they cannot comprehend the full measure of her significance. The frontier is a mother and the frontier process, mothering. Yet, we are confounded with the frontier as a population, "a density of two or more to the square mile".55 Then, too, there is the definition of the frontier as "the meeting point between savagery and civilization".56 If, in the myth, the frontier is the mother, then the son "of her loins", the child whom she took "to her bosom", is the frontiersman. For, as Freund noted, Turner tended to use the singular.57 The interaction of the frontier and the frontiersman was supposed to produce changes in the pioneer's nature.58 These free lands promoted individualism, economic equality, freedom to rise, democracy ... In a word then, free lands meant free opportunities.59 The first ideal of the pioneer was that of conquest ... The rifle and the ax are the symbols of the backwoods pioneer. They meant the training in aggressive courage, in domination, in directness of action, in destructiveness.60 53 Ibid., 268. 54 Ibid., 261. 55 Ibid., 3. 5) Ibid. 57 Freund, op. cit., 85. 58 Pierson, "The Frontiersman", 467. 59 Turner, The Frontier, 259-60. 60 Ibid., 269-70.</page><page sequence="9">HIDDEN THEMES 369 Thus, fired with the idea of subdueing the wilderness, the destroying pioneer fought his way across the continent, masterful and wasteful, preparing the way by seeking the immediate thing, rejoicing in rude strength and wilful achievement.6' First of all there was the idea of discovery, the courageous determination to break new paths, indifference to dogma, that because an institution or condition exists it must remain.62 Our mythological hero's contact with the frontier, like Antaeus' strength- giving contact with his mother, Earth, calls from within the frontiersman the idea of conquest, of subdueing, and of mastering.63 The frontiersman rejoices in rude strength and willful achievement. He is a ruthless individual with a wish to dominate, to be destructive, to be masterful, and to use the West and its resources in a destructive way. He has an indifference to dogma or to established institutions. But, more than this: In the Revolutionary days, the settlers crossed the Alleghanies and put a barrier between them and the coast. They became, to use their phrases, "the men of the Western Waters," the heirs of the "Western world." In this era, the backwoods- men, all along the western slopes of the mountains, with a keen sense of the differences between them and the dwellers on the coast, demanded organization into independent States of the Union. Self-government was their ideal64 ... the riflemen ... protested against the rule of governments east of the moun- tains, and asserted with manly independence their right to self government.65 The "men of the Western Waters" broke with the old order of things, sub- ordinated social restraint to the freedom of the individual, won their title to the rich lands . . . hotly challenged the right of the East to rule them, demanded their own states ... spoke with contempt of the old social order of ranks and classes in the lands between the Alleghanies and the Atlantic, and proclaimed the ideal of democracy for the vast country which they had entered.66 From the beginning of the settlement of America, the frontier regions have exer- cised a steady influence toward democracy ... The small landholders seeing that their powers were steadily passing into the hands of the wealthy planters who controlled Church and State and Lands, rose in revolt.67 The frontiersman was in a state of rebellion against authority. He asserted his right to rule himself with "manly independence". He fights to win the rich lands, the frontier-mother-West, and hotly challenged the right of the East to rule him. But it is not in the area of self rule alone that the frontiersman is in conflict with the East: In some portions of the country (the East) there was and is an aggregation of 61 Ibid., 270. 62 Ibid., 306. 63 Pierson, "The Frontiersman", 472-76. 64 Turner, The Frontier, 206-7. 65 Ibid., 169. 66 Ibid., 183. 67 Ibid., 247.</page><page sequence="10">370 ALAN C. BECKMAN property, and vested rights are in the fore ground: in others (the West) capital is lacking, more primitive conditions prevail ...68 It needed capital, it was a debtor region, while the East had the capital and was a creditor section. The West was rural, agricultural, while the East was becoming more and more urban and industrial ... without acumulated inherited wealth, the frontier regions stressed the rights of man, while the statesman of the East stressed the rights of property.69 The East feared an unchecked democracy, which might overturn minority rights, destroy established institutions, and attack vested interests. The buoyant, optimistic and sometimes reckless and extravagant spirit of innovation was the very life of the West. In the East innovation was a term of reproach.70 The abolition of the Established Church would still further have diminished the influence of the coastwise party in favor of the dissenting sects of the interior.71 The free pioneer democracy struck down the slaveholding aristocracy on its march to the West.72 The dread of Western emancipation from New England's political and economic control was paralleled by her fears lest the West cut loose from her religion.73 The East has property, the frontiersman has not. The East represents an established church, a uniform morality, but the frontiersman belongs to an off-shoot sect. The East represents an established authority; a father or a father surrogate. The East wants to check, to regulate, and to hold the frontiersman to an established morality. The frontiersman, however, wants to rule himself, to take what he wants even if it means breaking down established institutions. The West is to be his to use and to waste, and if the westerner is checked by the East he asserts his "manly independence" and rejects the East's morality. The frontiersman revels in his primitive wishes, and primitive morality. He embraces a primitive idea of the law as well. Frontier justice is a swift, eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth code, a lex talionis; as the follow- ing quotations illustrate: The frontiersman was impatient of restraints. He knew how to preserve order, even in the absence of legal authority. If there were cattle thieves, lynch law was sudden and effective. ... There was a reproduction of the primitive idea of the personality of the law, a crime was more an offense against the victim than a violation of the law of the land. Substantial justice, secured in the most direct way, was the ideal of the backwoodsman. He had little patience with the finely drawn distinctions or scruples of the method.74 68 Ibid., 210. 69 Frederick J.

He was impatient of any govern- mental restrictions upon his individual right to deal with the wilderness.76 From the time the frontiersman centered his interest upon the development of the West, when he broke with the past, a restless, nervous energy became a characteristic. This "strained nervous energy" is a result of the frontiers- man's attempt to exploit the free lands and to work out his destiny. Thus: Colonial travelers agree in remarking on the phlegmatic characteristics of the colonists. It has frequently been asked how such a people could have developed that strained nervous energy now characteristic of them ... The transition appears to have become marked at the close of the War of 1812, a period when interest centered upon the development of the West, and the West was noted for restless energy.77 Energy, incessant activity became the lot of this new American ... "Time seems too short for what they have to do and the result always come short of their desire." ... But free lands and the consciousness of working out their social destiny did more than turn the Westerner to material interests and devote him to a restless existence.78 All was the motion and change. A restlessness was universal ... When the bark started from their fence rails, they felt the call to change. They were conscious of the mobility of their society and gloried in it. They broke with the past and thought to create something finer, more fitting for humanity, more beneficial for the average man than the world had ever seen.79 But, as the excerpts below reveal, the frontiersman began to realize that he could not live unrestrained; for it meant rule by the strongest. Ambition and forcefulness needed to give way to reason. The frontiersman began to lose his primitive characteristics, to accept legislation, and social control. By taking this step towards reason, by renouncing the idea of unbridled compe- tition, our frontiersman came to resemble the Easterner. Exploitation of free land is given up for regulation through law. The frontier has passed. ... a new society has emerged from its contact with the backwoods. Gradually this society loses its primitive conditions, and assimilates itself to the type of the older social conditions of the East; but it bears within it enduring and distinguish- ing survivals of its frontier experience.80 We have so far won our national home, wrested from it its first rich treasures, 75 ibid., 153. 76 Ibid., 272. 77 ibid., 37, footnote 54. 78 ibid., 211-12. 79 Ibid., 354-5. 80 Ibid., 205.</page><page sequence="12">372 ALAN C. BECKMAN and drawn to it the unfortunate of other lands, that we are already obliged to compare ourselves with the settled states of the Old World.81 Two ideals were fundamental in traditional American thought, ideals that develop- ed in the pioneer era. One was that of individual freedom to compete unrestrict- edly for the resources of a continent - the squatter ideal .. . The other was the ideal of a democracy ... But American democracy was based on an abundance of free lands; these were the very conditions that shaped its growth and its fundamental traits. Thus time has revealed that these two ideals of pioneer de- mocracy had elements of mutual hostility and contained the seeds of its dis- solution.82 As the western settler began to face the problem of magnitude in the areas he was occupying; as he began to adjust his life to the modern forces of capital and to complex productive processes; as he began to see that go where he would, the question of credit and currency, of transportation and distribution in general conditioned his success, he sought relief by legislation. He began to lose his primitive attitude of individualism, government began to look less like a neces- sary evil and more like an instrument for the perpetuation of his democratic ideals. In brief, the defense of the pioneer democrat began to shift from free land to legislation, from the ideal of individualism to the ideal of social control through regulation by law. He had no sympathy with the radical reconstruction of society by the revolution of socialism; even his alliance with the movement of organized labor, which paralleled that of organized capital in the East, were only half hearted.... The essential point is that his conception of the right of government to control social process had undergone a change.83 It now becomes clear that the frontier thesis is a symbolic re-enactment of a universal wish drama of childhood, the Oedipus conflict, a wish drama whose enactment is necessary for the psychological development of a boy into a man.84 The West, or frontier, is the mother who had once been the source of early gratifications, but who now becomes the object of those first, primitive, but nevertheless masculine stirrings and strivings of her young son, our frontiersman. The curious description of the frontier as the "meeting point between savagery and civilization" also becomes clear. The West, as Turner depicted it, offers the frontiersman the possibility of bounteous reward; nature is not described as cruel. The human characters of the frontier, the Indian and the frontiersman, are savage. The frontiersman derives his "savage feelings" as a result of the contact with the frontier.85 A child's concept of being a man with mother is a primitive one and he views his wishes to be masculine as en- tailing savage behavior and interaction. 81 Ibid., 294. 82 Ibid., 320. 83 Ibid., 276-7. 84 S.

And, here, I think, is the significance for Turner of the definition that the frontier had a "density of two or more to the square mile". The frontiersman views himself in conflict with the East. The East has all the attributes of a father; he governs, holds property, represents morality, and retains power. The conflict has arisen since the frontiersman became interested in and wanted the frontier-West-mother for himself. It is a one-sided conflict; for the East has the power and the property. Moreover, the frontiersman operates on the principle of lex talionis; his concern for his wellbeing makes him nervous and restless. The strongest can retaliate against the weakest, a more mature principle than rule of the strongest, survival of the fittest is needed; a rule of law and reason. Having accepted the rule of reason, the frontiersman becomes like the East-father. Civilization entails giving up the mother, giving up competition with the father, and giving up savage wishes and primitive modes - the frontier has passed. But two questions remain, what does the repetition of this process mean? For, the frontier acculturation process moves across the continent occurring over and over. And, even though the frontiersman becomes like the East- father, why are the most valued traits seen as coming from the West-mother; with a refusal to accept any traits as coming from the East-father: When the backwoodsmen crossed the Alleghanies they put between themselves and the Atlantic Coast a barrier which seemed to separate them from a region already too much like the Europe they had left, and as they followed the courses of the rivers that flowed to the Mississippi, they called themselves "Men of the Western Waters," and their new home in the Mississippi Valley was the "Western World." 86 This new democracy that captured the country and destroyed the ideals of states- manship came from no theorist's dreams of the German forest. It came, stark and strong and full of life, from the American forest.87 American democracy was born of no theorist's dream; it was not carried in the Susan Constant to Virginia, nor in the Mayflower, to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier. Not the Constitution but free land and an abundance of natural re- sources open to fit people, made the democratic type of society in America for three centuries while it occupied its empire.88 One of the important reasons for the popularity of the Turner thesis was that it "gave expression", but not "in some mysterious fashion to ancient and powerful beliefs" - to the re-enactment of a universal childhood wish drama, the Oedipus conflict. The beliefs are ancient in that every man's early child- hood is, in a sense, his ancient history. The story hidden in the frontier thesis, 86 Ibid., 302. 87 Ibid., 216. 88 Ibid., 293.</page><page sequence="14">374 ALAN C. BECKMAN expressed symbolically, was discernible to each reader in what might seem to be a mysterious fashion.89 Turner described the frontier "as a gate of escape" which men could use when conditions became intolerable.90 While the safety-valve theory as stated by Turner has been discredited, as Kane pointed out, it had importance as "an ideological factor" and that it "acted as a psychological vent".9' Kane meant that the theory did not have to be valid; if men thought it were true, then in a sense it was as satisfactory as if it were true. Kane was, of course, correct; there is a great deal of gratification in imagining how one would like things to be or how they could be. Such thought describes a form of primitive thinking "which in contradiction to logical and realistic thinking. .. permits wishes and desires. .. to appear attainable or even fulfilled".92 In fact, Benedek calls this imaginative thinking process, "an intra-psychic safety valve which yields relief from tension".93 The interrelationship of the imaginary "family triangle" and the process of imagining can easily be seen. The appeal of the safety valve doctrine is that one is not trapped by reality, he may change it; if not externally, then at least, psychically. The Turner hypothesis, moreover, appealed to that latent, but not dor- mant, wish in each individual for omnipotence.94 It is not to this wish alone that the appeal is made; for Turner's handling of the enormous amount of data related to America's development, his attempt to synthesize, integrate, 89 Unconscious communication is the sine qua non of psychoanalytic therapy. To clarify my usage, see S. Freud, Totem and Taboo in A. A. Brill (ed.), The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (New York, 1938), 928; Freud deals with the idea of sym- bol, totem, and taboo formation and states that each individual has an "apparatus" which gives an unconscious understanding of customs and ceremonies. It is this same "apparatus" which allowed the readers of the frontier thesis to unconsciously under- stand the hidden themes. Freud felt the oedipal theme is universal and is a part of each person's unconscious, thus accounting for the popularity of the Oedipus legend and drama. He interpreted oedipal themes in Macbeth and used this insight to give under- standing to Lady Macbeth in "Some Character Types Met With in Psychoanalytic Work", Collected Papers, 4 (New York, 1959), 318-44. 90 Turner, The Frontier, 259. 91 Kane, op. cit., 188. 92 Benedek, op. cit., 90. 93 Ibid. 94 S. Freud, "One of the Difficulties of Psycho-analysis", Collected Papers, 4, 347-56. In this article, Freud relates that man has suffered three blows to his narcissism; the first of these was a cosmological one when general recognition was given in the theory of Copernicus - man could no longer hold the belief that he was at the center of the universe; the second blow was a biological one and was delivered by Darwin - man could no longer hold the belief that he was but a step below the angels, when scien- tifically he was merely a step above the animals; and the final blow, the psychological one, was given by Freud, when he showed that man's reason and behavior are frequently unconsciously derived. In somewhat the same sense I have used the word omnipotence in order to include the magical thinking of childhood. Roszak, op. cit. alludes to a less healthy version of this when he mentions "historians who dote on the vicarious power they derive from dealing so thickly in the affairs of the mighty".</page><page sequence="15">HIDDEN THEMES 375 and generalize from this data, is a process similar to that which goes on in that most necessary part of the mind, the ego, which attempts to take the myriad of sensations, stimulations, and facts of life and attempts to fit all these into some type of useful theoretical structure.95 To illustrate these points I should like to cite from Turner's writings again. The significance of the Mississippi Valley in American history was first shown in the fact that it had opened to various nations visions of power in the new world - visions that sweep across the horizons of historical possibility like the luminous but unsubstantial aurora of a comet's train, portentous and fleeting. Out of the darkness of the primitive history of the continent are being drawn the evidence of the rise and fall of Indian cultures, the migrations through and into the great Valley by men of the Stone Age, hinted at in the legends and languages, dimly told in the records of mounds and artifacts, but waiting still for a complete inter- pretation.96 These lines call upon the reader, along with the various nations, to have "visions that sweep across the horizon of historical possibility", to encompass a broad section of the time spectrum, to envision the movement, the rise and fall of men in our dim pre-history, and, perhaps, to interpret the meaning and significance of those archaic languages and legends. In short, the reader is asked to step out of time and from this ethereal, objective vantage point like some aloof immortal to survey the rise and fall of a culture. Omnipotence and immortality are, for the moment, conjured forth in the reader's imagination. Note how these very same appeals occur again in these lines: While his horizon was still bounded by the clearing that his ax had made, the pioneer dreamed of continental conquests. The vastness of the wilderness kindled his imagination. His vision saw beyond the dank swamp at the edge of the great lake to the lofty buildings and the jostling multitudes of a mighty city: beyond the rank, grass-clad prairie to the seas of golden grain; beyond the harsh life of the log hut and the sod house to the home of his children, where should dwell comfort and the higher things of life, though they might not be for him.97 This time the reader is asked to project himself, like the pioneer, into the future rather than into the past. But, aloof, one must stand outside time and envision the unfolding of the future. To emphasize these ideas, I need only cite the most quoted part of Turner's original essay, the one which immediately comes to mind: 98 Stand at Cumberland Gap and watch the procession of civilization marching single file - the buffalo following the trail to the salt springs, the Indian, the fur-trader and the hunter, the cattle-raiser, the pioneer farmer - and the frontier 95 See, S.

Wish notes these as the most quoted sentences.</page><page sequence="16">376 ALAN C. BECKMAN has passed by. Stand at South Pass in the Rockies a century later and see the same procession with wider intervals between.99 Turner frequently calls upon the reader to stand like an immortal colossus astride the stream of time and events to witness the re-enactment of the past and the fulfillment of the future. The entire essay of 1893 encapsulates the three hundred year evolution of America and reduces vast forces, magni- tudinous factors, and monumental events to comprehensible and managable proportions. To those long ago wishes in us all of early childhood to be an all powerful, all knowing giant, stronger than Paul Bunyan, or one's father, the Turner essays have strong appeal. It is not, however, just to hidden wishes that Turner appeals; for Turner brought both a new approach to the writing of American history and a meaningful, even if inaccurate, theoretical understanding of American devel- opment. His ability to organize, where before was chaos, holds a strong attraction to readers. Turner arranged the parts of a puzzle into a whole. The organizing quality is not only implicit in Turner's writings but in his teaching methods as well. Turner presented himself not as a master, but as a learner. He encouraged his students to think and to inquire independently. His students could identify with him in this way.'00 He encouraged the use of original sources, presented an almost overwhelming amount of material, and then, the "joint-venture of students and teacher in search of truth began".101 Turner helped his students to organize the data of history. So intrinsic a part of Turner was this organizational ability that an eminent student was to write: As Woodrow Wilson observed in 1896 he has peculiar power in combining the large view with the small one, the general plan and conception with the minute examination of particulars. His method of synthesis, which is based on far reaching accurate analysis takes cognizance of certain pitfalls in the task of generalizing from data of the social sciences.102 If my understanding of what I consider to be the hidden theme of the thesis is correct, that is, it is a symbolic reenactment of the "family triangle", then can we extract from this additional knowledge a reasonable speculation as to why Turner wrote the essay when he did? It is quite possible; for some significant event must have occurred in Turner's life to cause him to re- capitulate a dormant childhood dream. The passing of the frontier, according to my formulation means a renunciation of the mother and an end of com- 99 Turner, The Frontier, 12. 100 I have already cited Craven, Becker, Jacobs and Curti; also see, Edward E.

When, in fact, did Turner arrive at his formulation? Obviously the essay was written after the Census of 1890 and, according to Turner the foundation of the essay was made prior to December, 1892.103 Mood places it earlier than this and indicated his belief that Turner arrived at his conclusion before mid-November, 1891.104 There was "first a slow unfolding and then suddenly in a flash of final clarity", Mood feels, the leading doctrines came to Turner.'05 The event must have occurred before this time. Since Turner pivoted his essay on a statement by the Superintendent of the Census of 1890 and this statement contains the idea of the end of the frontier, there is a strong suspicion that the event occurred in 1890. In the Spring of 1890, Turner was made head of the History Department of the University of Wisconsin.100 It was the death of Professor William F. Allen which led to this appointment.'07 Actually, Allen died unexpectedly on December 9, 1889.108 The relationship with Allen had profoundly influenced Turner and it was due to Allen's inspiration that Turner gave up journalism, his father's field, to become a professional historian.109 More than this, Turner and Allen were warm friends; so much that Turner was "in and out of the Allen household every day and Alien was happy in the companionship".1'0 Turner remarked later, "Allen taught me all the history I know".'" There was a sufficient measure of truth to this; for Allen was a pioneer teacher in the topical system of study and in the use of original source material."2 Then, too, Turner followed Allen's lead in the "practice of drawing maps to illustrate the significant changes in historical geography" and in the organization of material in syllabus form."13 And, Turner had access to and made use of the Draper Collection, that trove of original source material."4 Allen's interest was Roman history, but he saw that expansion was a process common to American and Roman history.115 Following Allen's death, Turner undertook the "duties of literary executor 103 Turner, The Frontier, 1; see footnote 1. 104 Mood, "Turner's Formative Period", op. cit., 35.

BECKMAN and bore a part in the preparation of a memorial volume of Allen's essays".116 Mood wonders if Turner drew some important inferences "as he worked out the preface for Allen's book during the Christmas vacation, 1889".117 What thoughts, indeed, went through Turner's mind as he worked at this task, especially when the question of his becoming Allen's successor loomed as a possibility although not a certainty. What an ironic period containing as it did an admixture of loss and hope. From a viewpoint seventy-four years detached, let us try to review these facts. Turner had gone to the University of Wisconsin with the idea to become a journalist. His father, Andrew Jackson Turner, was a newspaper man.118 Strongly influenced by Allen, Turner changed fields. His was not a total shift; since Andrew Turner was a sometime historian as well as newspaper editor.11 Nevertheless, an early wish to be like the father is given up by Turner and instead he decides to become a historian like Allen. Thus, in replacing Turner's father as the influential person in Turner's eyes, Allen took on some attributes previously retained by Turner's father; that is to say, Allen became a father surrogate. That the relationship was a close one has already been mentioned. But Turner, a vigorous young man of twenty-eight, while he enjoyed his friendship with his senior, must have had normal ambitions, too. Did the thought that he would like to be department head cross through his mind? Most likely. Perhaps, in a benign way he thought of Allen's retirement at some distant date. Or, thoughts of succession may have passed through Turner's mind without his being aware of them. That Turner was normally ambitious and thought of advancement, seems to me, a logical surmise. Such thoughts mean that the person occupying the position must depart, one way or another. What then would the sudden death of Alllen mean to Turner who liked, admired, and respected Allen, but at the same time wished to succeed him? Secret wishes, whose realization are not actually wanted, are the cause of much internal suffering.120 Was the unexpected death of Allen and Turner's suc- cession to Allen's position a sufficient blow to cause Turner to feel an inner sense of torment? The thematic material which was dealt with earlier suggests that what was stirred up in Turner's relationship with Allen were elements of a childhood conflict which once centered around the father. Now, partially renewed, the competitive components were focused on Allen. But, Allen's death and Turner's advancement professionally, caused Turner unawares to 111 Ibid., 25. 117 Ibid., 27. 118 Mood, "The Development of Frederick Jackson Turner as a Historical Thinker", op. cit., 285. 119 Ibid.

If it is true that Turner felt a deep sense of guilt by succeeding Allen, then the two curious aspects which puzzled us before become clear. The reason why the frontiersman will not accept any of his traits as coming from the father is that he feels too guilty to feel indebted to the father. The repetition of this theme is an attempt to work out, over and over again, the idea that one can become like the father without being obligated in any way. In a sense Turner was saying I need not feel guilty for wishing to replace my father since I do not owe him anything. It is not difficult to see how the East took on the meaning it did for Turner; for the three important men in his life were Easterners. Andrew Jackson Turner, his father, came from Lake Champlain County in Upper New York State.121 Professor Willam F. Allen was born in Northboro, Massachusetts.122 Turner's mentor at Johns Hopkins, Herbert Baxter Adams, came from Shutes- berg, Massachusetts.123 Adams is, most likely, the connecting link in the symbol complex of the East with European influences. It is well known to historians that Adams attempted to trace the origins of Western democratic institutions in the supposed egalitarian practices of the Volk of the Teutonic forests. That government was included in the symbol continuum is not un- usual; for it has already been noted that "government is generally viewed as a projection of fatherhood".124 Then too, Andrew Turner had served as Mayor of Portage Wisconsin from 1881 to 1884.125 How the frontier-West-mother symbol complex was formed is less apparent, even though the symbolism is less hidden. Feldman has described the process whereby the child extends the affection for the mother to the immediate sur- roundings and finally to the land itself and in this way, the "notion of Mother Nature develops".126 The West as described by Turner is clearly a "mother".127 Then, too, the fact that Turner ascribed to the frontier the ability to form, to develop, and to change character shows that in his mind he had the idea of the frontier as a nurturing entity. In actuality, character traits are, in the main, formed by the time the child has reached the age of five and the important nurturing persons are the parents, particularly the mother. As others have noted, Turner had a "deep felt emotional attachment to the West".128 Turner once remarked, "My mother's ancestors were preachers!" "Is it strange that I 121 Mood, "The Development of Frederick Jackson Turner as a Historical Thinker", op. cit., 282. 122 Dictionary of American Biography, op. cit., 211. 123 Ibid., 69-70. 124 A.

BECKMAN preached of the frontier?" 129 One might ask did he mean to say, "Is it strange that I preached of my mother?" Suffice it to say, however, that Turner con- nected the writing of his essays with his mother. Elsewhere, Turner revealed that he had written his essay partly "to try to account for" himself and his "people" and partly as a reaction from a state- ment by Adams "that the Hopkins man, having dealt with local institutional history of the United States had thus explored the chief remaining opportunity for constructive work in American History - or words to that effect".130 There is some question whether or not Adams made that statement.131 Others, too, have noted that Turner's essay of 1893 was a rebellion against the then exclusive emphasis on Germanic origins.132 Another reason Turner gave for writing his essay was to attempt "to apply to American History the mode of treatment" he had learned from Allen.133 This last reason illustrates Turner's feeling of indebtedness to Allen, a feeling that caused Turner inner torment; so much so that Turner, unconsciously, needed to deny this sense of owing. Thus far, the assumption that Turner was bothered by a sense of guilt has been in the nature of a speculative inference. Is there more apparent behav- ioral evidence that Turner suffered from unconscious guilt feelings? Turner, Mood observed, seeing his dissertation in print, wrote to Adams "that he was very much dissatisfied .., with the way he had put them (his ideas) down", which, Mood felt, gave "an early indication to that tendency towards perfectionism which haunted him (Turner) all his days" .134 Another admirer relates that Turner, given a mechanical task or one upon which he could not improve, "was at an impasse of his own making, a balk from which he could not budge without literally flogging himself".135 Moreover, this writer goes on to say, soon after Turner read his now famous essay, he signed a contract for a text book history, and "for forty years the contract stood ... the promise was a thorn in the would be producer's flesh".136 Billington sub- jects this particular failing in Turner to greater exposure.137 ".Intellectually, emotionally, and physically," Turner, asserts Billington, "was incapable of the sustained effort needed to complete a major scholarly 129 Turner as quoted in Joseph Schafer, "Turner's Autobiographical Letter to Constance Lindsay Skinner", in Bernette, Wisconsin Witness, 55-67; Wisconsin Magazine of His- tory, 19 (1935-36), 91-103. 130 W.

Not a single one of these books "was to see the light of day, but both author and publishers endured years of anguish before they accepted that sad fact".140 Turner "sought to justify his lack of production" by giving attention to university affairs, by devoting himself to his students, and by retreating to the forest and stream to find "the peace he could not find in his work".'4' "Yet deep within himself, Turner wanted nothing so much as to write the 'big books' that Edward Channing expected of him." 142 However, "plagued by his inner conscience as well as by his publisher's agents, he lived a life of frustration and self doubt that haunted his declining years".'43 Turner exposed himself "to knowledge of varied sorts in the hopes of greater discoveries".144 He was chagrined "that further startling discoveries did not come his way"'45 "He thought that he was not living up to his early promise." 146 To Turner as to his frontiersman the result always came short of his desire.'47 One need only listen to these phrases, "haunted him all his days", "without literally flogging himself", "a thorn in the would be producer's flesh", and "years of anguish" to see that each writer has caught the idea of punishment. Punishment, but for what crime? It was for a thought crime committed first as a small boy and later ruefully realized upon the death of Allen and his succession to Allen's position. Billington has correctly caught the essential dynamics when he described Turner as "plagued by his inner conscience". Turner might fall into a category described as those who are "wrecked by success".'48 This manifestation is closely connected with the very wish drama that is the major hidden theme of the thesis.'49 This inner conscience, as punishment for wishes against the father and/or father substitutes, would not allow Turner to feel satisfaction about his real accomplishments, which were many. It would not allow him to write the "big books" he wished to write; for it said to him, "As punishment, you will not succeed, you will not feel success!" The future biographer of Turner will need to take into account the presence of this hidden theme in the frontier thesis, as it gives an important under- 138 Ibid., 15. 139 ibid., 16. 140 ibid., 9. 141 ibid., 18. 142 ibid., 20-1. 143 ibid.

BECKMAN standing to Turner's relationship with the father figures in Turner's life. It also makes understandable Turner's rebellion against some, like Adams, and his need to feel he was a disappointment to others, such as Edward Channing and Max Farrand.150 It explains why Turner was never able to achieve ad- ditional historical insights and why he tended to repeat his original statement again and again. Hopefully, that biographer will place this problematic aspect of Turner's inner life in its proper perspective against the backdrop of the rich personality who was "Frederick Jackson Turner - Master Teacher". Essentially in this paper, I have applied psychoanalytic understanding to the essays of Frederick Jackson Turner, thereby uncovering a major hidden theme. The presence of this theme made it possible to offer a reasonable speculation as to why Turner wrote his famous essay when he did. Moreover, the uncovering of this theme leads to the major statement of this paper, that the great popularity of the Turner thesis has been due to the fact that it symbolically depicted a universal wish drama of childhood which was dis- cerned and understood by the reader, who, after all, had experienced and played out in his own imagination this very same drama; so that he had a posteriori knowledge of the theme. And it was because of this experience that the reader tended to suspend judgement and accept the hypothesis as an a priori truth. ALAN C.
