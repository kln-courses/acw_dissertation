<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETHOLOGY Essential Animal Behavior. By Graham Scott. 2004. Blackwell Publishing (ISBN 0632057998). 202 pp. Paperback $54.95. Hapalochlaena lunulata is a strik- ingly beautiful animal and one that adorns the front cover of this inter- esting book. With its brilliant blue rings of luminescent chro- matophores, this octopus displays warning signals during times of aggression and defense that rival any comparable behaviors in the animal kingdom. Yet warning colors are just one of the many strategies utilized by coleoids (squids, octopuses, cuttle- fish) and other invertebrates for defense, and represent only the tip of the tentacle when it comes to the vast array of amazing animal behaviors. Graham Scott's well-written descrip- tion of this animal opens Essential Animal Behavior, a concise textbook that covers many of the animal world's most common, and in some cases, unusual behaviors. As a textbook geared for under- graduates, Essential Animal Behavior attempts to cover the spec- trum of classical and recent exam- ples of behavioral experiments, and thereby provide the reader with an introduction to this highly integra- tive discipline. Scott deftly incorpo- rates the newest information derived from genetics, molecular biology, and physiology into eight chapters and many short, easy-to-read case studies. The case studies, demarcat- ed by purple boxes, highlight partic- ular examples within a chapter. For example, one case study in the chap- ter "Controlling Behavior: The Role of the Nervous System" highlights how the tactile hairs (trichobothria) of a predatory spider's legs relay information about the position of potential prey items (flies) in the air above the spider. This fascinating case, like the dozen or so others in the book, provides the original refer- ence(s) at the end of the case study, so students do not need not to scan the bibliography to find more detailed information. Key references are also provided throughout the text when important topics are dis- cussed. Other highlights of the book include "focus" boxes that cover some basic concepts in more depth (e.g., anthropomorphism, the utility of mathematical models), "concept" boxes that generally cover defini- tions and brief explanations, and "application" boxes that describe how experimental results translate into real-world applications. For example, one study revealed that a chemical (17cx-ethinylestradiol), when added to a food source (single chicken egg), can be used to deter predators (raccoons, crows) from consuming untreated chicken eggs, a behavior described as "condi- tioned taste aversion." Color photo- graphs and artwork supplement these highlights and add to the char- acter of the book. The brevity of Essential Animal Behavior makes the book a good supplement to any undergraduate course in Animal Behavior or General Biology. However, it cannot be used as a stand-alone source of information. Other textbooks in the field are generally 500 pages or more, and therefore cover a wider range of topics in more detail. However, as the author acknowl- edges in the "Preface," the purpose of the book is to provide an easy-to- read introduction to the topic for majors and non-majors, and perhaps stimulate their interests so they will look a little further on their own. I would recommend this book to stu- dents with a general interest in Animal Behavior and to those researchers who are not themselves behaviorists, but have a budding curiosity for the subject.
