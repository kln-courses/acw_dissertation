Freud to Rolland May, 1931 THE FREUD-ROLLAND CORRESPONDENCE: FIVE NEW LETTERS Editor's Note " David James Fisher, now a member of the History Depart ment at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign), did research at the Archives Romain Rolland in Paris between 1971 and 1975 and came across five unpublished letters from Freud to Rolland. Through his efforts, copies were placed in the Sigmund Freud Copyrights, which granted permission for their reproduction in this article. " Two or three of the letters are of some significance. The first, dated March 2, 1923, acknowledges the gift of Rolland's " Liluli," which ironically deflates illusions associated with war. Ernest Jones (1957) states that the book was sent by the French author on Feb. 23 along with the revelation that he had been following Freud's writings for twenty years. The second letter, written by Freud on June 15, 1924, refers to a personal visit by Rolland to himself and to his daughter Anna, and contains a rare hint of a wish for death as he was suffering severe pain connected with his cancer. A message</page><page sequence="2">2 David James Fisher acknowledging Rolland's congratulations on his eightieth birthday is a reminder not only of Freud's memorable letter about his " Memory " of the Acropolis, written on the occasion of Rolland's seventieth birthday, but of the special pleasure he got from Rolland (Jones 1957). Mr. Fisher's doctoral dissertation, Romain Rolland and the Question of the Intellectual, will be published in 1976." Freud's relationship with Romain Rolland spans the years 1923 to 1939. It began when the two, aged sixty-seven and fifty-seven years respectively, had reached intellectual maturity. Vast differences separated them, and their controversies on religious sensation, on psychoanalysis, and on mysticism sprang partly from divergent cultural and social formations. Central European and Jewish, Freud was heir to the nineteenth cen tury's evolutionary and rationalist traditions. While also straddling the two centuries, Rolland was French and Catholic, a professional historian and musicologist by training, an artist, novelist, and biographer of epic heroes. Moreover, their personalities contrasted widely. After the publication of the Freud-Jung correspondence, scholars now agree that Freud's personality decisively stamped itself upon the evolution of psychoanalytic theory and practice.1 We shall see how and why Freud's character played an enig matic role in his friendship with the French Nobel laureate. Because he was unable to separate men from their ideas,2 Freud's exchanges with Rolland were at once intimate and marked by personal frictions. In the late 1920's and early 1930's, they reached an impasse on the question of the origins and significance of the " oceanic " sensation. Freud's mixed feelings for Rolland surfaced again in his 1936 paper, "A Disturbance of Memory on the Acropolis," written to celebrate the French writer's seventieth birthday.

The intellectual paths of Freud and Rolland crisscrossed at a time when a wider European effort was under way to grasp the broader import of a recently ruptured civilization. « « « • * The Freud-Rolland relationship began fraternally in Feb rurary, 1923. On the ninth of that month, Freud wrote a short letter to the French scientist and aesthetician, Edouard Monod-Herzen, thanking him for his expression of " human sympathy." This simple gesture had momentarily dispelled the atmosphere of distrust which, according to Freud, permeated post-war Europe. Freud extended Monod-Herzen's expression of fellowship by asking him to convey his greetings to Rolland: " Since you are a friend of Roman Rolland, may I ask you to pass on to him a word of respect from an unknown admirer." 8 After receiving Freud's greeting from Monod-Herzen, Rolland replied promptly on February 22, 1923 with his first personal letter to Freud. He admitted with pride that he had been one of the first Frenchmen to appreciate Freud's writings, having discovered The Interpretation of Dreams some twenty years earlier, long before the world had recognized Freud's genius. He played on Freud's phrase, "unknown admirer," by gently flattering the Viennese physician: he indicated that Stefan Zweig and he had often discussed Freud. Rolland used the metaphor of exploration to describe the impact of Freud's discoveries: " You have been the Christopher Columbus of a new continent of the mind." While many artists and philos ophers had already discovered the unconscious, they had arrived at their perceptions haphazardly. Freud offered a systematic access to the mind; his " conquests " were advancing not only other branches of psychology and medicine, but were also benefiting men involved in literary activity. Rolland confessed that Freud's "subliminal visions" corresponded to " some of [his] intuitions." He attributed the melancholy in Freud's letter to Monod Herzen to the "present miseries" of living in a defeated * Letter, Freud to Edouard Monod-Herzen, Feb. 9, 1923, in Ernst L.

Rolland reassured Freud that belonging to the vanquishing nation was not substantially better. He refused to associate himself with the Pyrrhic triumph of the Allies after the war, preferring to identify with those who had suffered. Victory was always more catastrophic for the vanquishers than for the vanquished. The contemporary crisis in European life was so severe that he predicated " the political ruin of Western Europe ...Notwithstanding the " convulsions " shaking the West and the prospect of further brutality, Rolland was con fident that " renewal "—at least on the intellectual or spiritual level—could be the end result. He concluded by expressing his " respect and admiration " for Freud.4 Rolland's letter pleased Freud. Soon after receiving it, he wrote his friend and colleague, Karl Abraham, that the French writer's letter contrasted with the wretchedness of the times: " A charming letter from Romain Rolland arrived here like a breath of fresh air; he mentions incidentally that he was interested in analysis twenty years ago." 5 On March 4, 1923, Freud replied personally to Rolland in what was to be the first in a series of eleven letters. He associated Rolland with three separate but overlapping acti vities: humanitarianism, pacifism, and art. For many men of Freud's generation, Rolland was the ideal " European," the man who was committed uncompromisingly to internationalism, Franco-German reconciliation, and genuine co-operation among human beings. Without questioning Rolland's sincerity, Freud viewed his noble goals as illusory and unrealizable, the projection on to mankind of Rolland's unfulfilled wishes: " Because for us your name has been associated with the most precious of beautiful illusions, that of love extended to all mankind."6 1 Letter, Rolland to Freud, Feb. 22, 1923, Archives Romain Rolland.

He clung to the " hope " that mankind would learn to channel its hostile urges into constructive avenues. If mankind did not " divert " its destructive instincts, the entire species might be annihilated. Either through his friendship with Stefan Zweig, the Austrian novelist and bio grapher, or perhaps through reading some of Rolland's pacifist writings during World War I, Freud had become conscious of the French writer's dissenting position.7 Characteristically, Freud echoed Rolland's anti-war stances by formulating his hope for peace in terms of science and progress: But if this one hope cannot be at least partly realized, if in the course of evolution we don't learn to divert our instincts from destroying our own kind, if we continue to hate one another for minor differences and kill each other for petty gain, if we go on exploiting the great progress made in control of natural resources for our mutual destruction, what kind of future lies in store for us? Freud evidently appreciated Rolland's creative achievements; he was familiar with some of the French writer's dramatic works as well as with the Noble Prize winning, epic novel, Jean Christophe (1904-1912). Yet, curiously enough, Freud re ferred to Rolland's writings not only in terms of admiration but also in terms of personal constrast: " My writings cannot be what yours are: comfort and refreshment for the reader." Earlier in the same letter, Freud had singled out two aspects of his personality which distinguished him from Rol land—his Jewishness and his devotion to science. He insisted that the burden of hundreds of years of persecution, exacer 'In late 1918, at the moment of the convening of the Versailles Peace Conference, Rolland and Freud, along with 100 other European intellectuals, signed a " Petition " circulated by the Dutch Committee of the Peoples ' Federation. See, Romain Rolland: Journal des années de guerre 1914-1919 (Paris, 1952), p. 1670. Both Rolland and Freud knew and corresponded with Frederik van Eeden, who might have played an intermediary role between them during the war. Rolland's anti-war essays have been collected under the title L'Esprit libre (Geneva, 1971). " Au-dessus de la mêlée," the most influential of his articles, was first published in September, 1914.</page><page sequence="6">6 David James Fisher bated by the presence of anti-Semitism in post-war Central Europe, was not conductive to faith in illusions. Because Freud's scientific method proceeded by tearing away the masks which hid human defenses, fears, and desires, his technique often proved to be a painful one, however therapeutic. In underminding human self-deception, he had not spared him self. " A great part of my life's work (I am 10 years older than you) has been spent trying to destroy illusions of my own and those of mankind." Freud thought that Rolland might be interested in his preliminary efforts, however transitional, to move from an analysis of individual psyches to those of society. Thus, besides sending him a copy of Group Psychology and Analysis of the Ego (1921), not a "particularly successful" work, he threw out a daring observation: " It is surely hard enough to perserve the continuation of our species in the conflict between our instinctual nature and the demands made upon us by civili zation." (Freud Letters, p. 347) Freud's preoccupation with his old age, his Jewishness, his science, and the dilemma of the individual's relationship to his society recurs throughout the Freud-Rolland relationship. Rolland reacted to Freud's first letter by commenting that it was written with " much bitterness," primarily because of Freud's dual burden: that of being a " destroyer of illusions..." and of bearing the heavy weight of being Jewish, " proscribed and humiliated in the Middle Ages and now again made responsible in Austria for the war, in Germany for the dis astrous peace." Above all, Rolland found Freud "very pessimistic about the future of humanity."8 Soon after receiving Freud's letter, Rolland mailed him a copy of Liluli (1919)—a play which ironically deflated con temporary mystifications about modern warfare. Freud was touched by the gift and by Rolland's personal dedication, which is now unfortunately lost. The tone of Freud's letter of acknowledgement is one of warmth and affection for the French writer: 8 Romain Rolland, Journal intime, extract written between March 4, 1923 and December 31, 1923, A.

But I did not know how to approach him. I was all the more pleased to hear from you that he wants to visit me, and I hasten to submit to you my suggestions. Freud expressed enthusiasm about the prospect of meeting Zweig's " great friend," as well as some concern about Rolland's precarious health.

Although he spoke and read French, Freud's pain from his prosthesis impeded his ability to converse in French.11 Freud's delight over the opportunity of meeting Rolland appears in a letter written to Lou Andreas Salomé: . .everything else, especially social contact, I keep at bay. (Of course Romain Rolland, who has announced himself for tomorrow, I cannot refuse)..12 Rolland met with Freud on Wednesday afternoon, May 14, 1924 at Freud's apartment. The conversation lasted probably a little more than one hour. For at least part of the time, Freud's youngest daughter Anna was present. Zweig introduced the two and translated. (Rolland read and under stood spoken German, but could not speak it himself.) Despite the presence of a small garden, Rolland characterized the " old Professor's " living quarters as a bit " somber." Because of the decorations, the rooms seemed cluttered, in a state of " pan demonium " : "... filled with small gods, fetiches, amulets, hallucinated projections of the erotic and religious dreams of humanity." Rolland was struck by Freud's age and sickness, and his capacity to bear gracefully the discomfort from his illness. He described him as " thin, his head a little simian." Despite his scientific breakthroughs and a considerable international reputation, Freud said fatalistically: " My time is past." Rolland reported that Freud had not become a titular professor at the University of Vienna, and consequently continued to give six hours of psychoanalytic " lessons " each day. Freud never complained about his misfortunes, but displayed " a beautiful example of heroic energy and vitality." A professor of " psychoanalytic pedagogy " in her own right, Anna Freud also served as a loyal collaborator and secretary to her father. In praising her " beautiful, tranquil, intelligent eyes," Rolland admitted an almost magnetic phy sical and mental attraction to her.

His familiarity with Freud and his " liter ary curiosity " prompted him to ask Freud to make his clinical files public. Freud countered that it was essential to maintain them secretly as privileged information between psychoanalyst and patient; he referred jokingly to Zweig as a" newsmongerl " Regarding the psychoanalytic technique, Rolland affirmed that their epoch had seen no more " precise " and " formidable " documentation of the human mind than Freud's. Speaking of psychoanalysis, Rolland used Catholic imagery; he saw therapy as a form of "confession" and Freud himself as a " confessor." Gifted with an " infallible memory " and a " lucid " intelligence, Freud had heard " the most dreadful secrets " of hundreds of personalities. Rolland also discovered that Freud read voraciously and that he was familiar with several of his guest's works. Freud told Zweig in the course of the conversation that he thought Rolland's novel, Annette et Sylvie (1922), beautifully written. Flattered by this praise, Rolland added that Freud's comments were of "a singular scientific value for [him]." Freud asked Rolland to send him his recently published biography of Gandhi and gave him in exchange a copy of the New Introductory Lectures on Psycho Analysis (1916-1917). The Freud-Rolland conversation covered a broad territory: the topics ranged from contemporary violence, the power and authenticity of man's instincts, the force of the " moral lie," to a general exchange on the nineteenth century, which was viewed by Freud as an era of peace and by Rolland as one of fear and hypocrisy. Their literary discussion focused on nineteenth century French and Russian novelists and on the relationship between creative genius and epilepsy. Here Freud revealed not only his scepticism about Flaubert's alleged epilepsy, but also asserted unequivocally that Dostovesky suffered from hysteria rather than the former. Likewise, Freud suggested that historical personalities such as Caesar, Alexander, and Napoleon were " pretended epileptics." 18 The conversation 18 Sigmund Freud, " Dostoevsky and Parricide," (1928), Standard Edition, XXI, pp. 177-194. There are many parallels between the Freud-Rolland con versation and Freud's paper on Dostoevsky. In both, Dostoevsky's neurosis is classified as " hysteroepilepsy " and not [epilepsy]; in terms of the relationship between epilepsy and intellectual impairment, Freud considered the case of Helmhotz the exception to the rule. (See, pp. 179, 181, 184.)</page><page sequence="10">10 David James Fisher concluded with a discussion of Freud's past and present iso lation. Rolland felt that the Viennese physician was " touched to know that [Rolland had] read him twenty years ago." During that period his work had remained almost "without echo" in France. Currently, Freud thought that his science was treated with " hostility " in Germany, and although " fam ous " in America, the Americans, Freud insisted, " understand absolutely nothing about it." 14 By the middle 1920's, Rolland had emerged as the Euro pean popularizer of Gandhism.15 He used his biography of the Indian leader, Mahatma Gandhi (1924), to proclaim his conversion to the doctrine of Non-Cooperation and absolute non-violence. Soon after his visit with Freud, he sent his friend a copy of the work. On June 15, 1924, Freud wrote Rolland thanking him for the book and reminiscing about the French writer's recent visit to his home. Rolland's presence had greatly moved Freud: June 15, 1924 Dearest Friend Mahatma Gandhi will accompany me on my vacation which will begin shortly. When I am alone in my study, I often think of the hour that you gave me and my daughter here, and I imagine you again in the red chair which we set out for you. I am not well.

By permission of Sigmund Freud copyrights.</page><page sequence="11">Sigmund Freud and Romain Rolland 11 Rolland inscribed sections of Freud's letter in his Journal intime, underlining the last sentence of the second paragraph, and singling out the German word die Abwicklung (the end) for special attention. In the letter, Freud had alluded to his illness and to his own death. It reinforced Rolland's perception of Freud's " stoical pessimism." 17 ******* Rolland's affectionate feelings for Freud, the man, never interfered with his opposition to the basic foundations of psychoanalysis. Before beginning his correspondence with and his meeting Freud, Rolland had discussed various aspects of depth psychology with the Geneva based psychiatrist and poet, Charles Baudouin. Arguing from his own theories of child psychology and from personal observations, he disagreed with the Freudian postulation of infantile sexuality, the oedipus and electra complex, and the reduction of the complicated network of the human mind to an " inflexible," " monotonous," and at times " extravagant " symbolism. The problem with the theory of childhood eroticism was that it imposed " obscure and subconscious " feelings onto healthy, young organisms; insistence on the theory, Rolland added, might cause disarray and even " ruin " the child's efforts to develop and reach maturity. It was psychoanalysts, not children, who were " haunted." Rolland objected to the universalization by psycho analysts of the oedipus complex; it could be detected only in abnormal people and in exceptional situations. He questioned whether normal children experienced either profound at traction to or repulsion from their parents. Psychoanalytic explanations of the various enigmas of the mind were " simplistic." More often than not, men and/or children were put into "pigeon-holes," instead of being studied as unique cases with individual dispositions and problems. While conceding that a vast number of psychoanalysts were intelligent, and that psychoanalytic insights were incisive, he observed that most practitioners were " not very normal... And [they] are fatally, almost unconsciously, attracted toward the exception. That is evident not only in Freud, who has at least a powerful 17 Romain Rolland, Journal intime, Jan. 1-Dec. 6, 1924, p. 122, A. R. R.</page><page sequence="12">12 David James Fisher vitality, but also in the Geneva psychologists..Refusing to argue issues on substantive grounds, psychoanalysts self-serving ly viewed criticism as a manifestation of their opponent's complex or resistance. Essentially, Rolland was criticizing the method of studying the abnormal in order to arrive at an understanding of the healthy; the hypothesis that " pathology is the magnification of the normal " remained to be proved. Since health implied a delicate, if not Pythagorean equilibrum of organic and psychic forces, it required a dangerous inductive leap to draw general conclusions from the evidence which concerned disorders.18 Stimulated by his visit to Freud, Rolland sketched his thoughts on psychoanalysis in his posthumously published auto biographical work, Le Voyage intérieur (1959). On the one hand, he admired both Freud the man and the historical value of his path-breaking discoveries. On the other hand, Rolland disagreed with the genetic psychoanalytic approach, the emphasis on the oedipal origins of neuroses and infantile sexuality. While discounting the seminal role or oedipal feelings in his own life, he stressed generational factors, the barriers which separated young people from their elders. Adolescence played a more formative role than early childhood in the development of mature psyches. From the ages of 16 to 20, the young adult experienced self-awareness with a rare intensity; during the process of self-discovery, he learned how to dream, to act, to be passionate, and independent.19 ... I must very clearly bear witness against the Freudian cosmogony of the Eros of the child who dreams... I have the greatest respect for the person of Freud, whom I have known, and I honor the fearlessness of the pilot who, equal to his great Phoenician ancestors, first adventured in the circumnavigation of the black Continent of the Mind. What his eyes have seen, he has said; and he has also arranged, drawn, and divided the half-true, half-fabulous, mad accounts of caravans of souls spun out of orbit, which 18 Letter, Rolland to Charles Baudouin, Jan 19, 1922, A.

But I declare with calm certainty: this black continent which he describes is not mine, I am of another people. In the shell of its memory, my race carries across the ages echoes of other voices, barkings of other monsters, and songs of other gods.20 Rolland footnoted these comments by clarifying that they were written " in 1924, a little after my visit to Freud and the beginning of my friendly relations with him—ten years before the mass mobilization of the Nazi ideologies against him..." 21 In the Appendix of Le Voyage intérieur, Rolland revealed that he had first found a copy of The Interpretation of Dreams in Zurich, shortly after its second edition appeared in 1909.22 Rolland drew an analogy between the contributions and reception of the works of Freud and Arnold Schönberg; these creative geniuses had charted entirely " new roads " in their respective fields. The world erroneously thought that their breakthroughs dated from the post-war period, rather than from the beginning of the century, again proving how far in advance were these courageous " precursors " and " navigators." Rolland had recognized the force of Freud's findings in 1909, having seen Freud as a fellow " pilgrim." Rolland's method of exploring the darker recesses of his own unconscious was through music: " alone, without guide, pushed forward by the demon of music—my master and my self."23 With Freud in mind, Rolland speculated on a number of personal conflicts in several brief passages of the same text; he entitled these fragments " Chapter of Principal Psychoanaly tic Confessions." He assumed that a psychological equilibrium of the mind's structures was attainable, even though the balance could be tipped easily. In his own psyche, he detected a partially involuntary self-regulating mechanism. Referring to the mechanism as one of " self-defense," or " self-correction," Rolland felt it worked by deflecting and reversing, often "Ibid., p. 112. 21 Ibid., p. 112 n. 1.

For example, the " monstrous " and " abnormal " excesses of his temperament were restrained by conscious activity, specifically the duties which he imposed by means of work and moral discipline. Inadequacies (" lacks ") were similarly compensated for in this manner. Rolland was convinced that within him, the movement toward equilibrium flowed in several directions, not merely from consciousness exercising control over the unconscious. Nonetheless, he understood that the antagonisms which divided man could explode at any moment, that the repressions of instinctual needs might overwhelm the psyche. Equilibrium was at best precarious: But the danger is that the violence of these opposite joltings does not demolish the organism—or that self defense in surpassing its limits, not be a worse danger than that which it attempts to ward off. (This is the case with regard to me, and one of the reasons for my gnawing insomnia.)2* * * * * * Stefan Zweig continued to play the role of intermediary between Rolland and Freud. Besides providing news of their respective activities, Zweig reminded the two of birthdays, and urged that they remain in contact through letters. Devoted to French culture, Zweig helped to translate and disseminate Rolland's works in Central Europe during and after the First World War.25 To honor Rolland's sixtieth birthday in 1926, Zweig collaborated with the young French novelist, Georges Duhamel, and with Maxim Gorky on an international Fest schrift. German contributors such as Hermann Hesse, Albert Einstein, and Freud would pay tribute to Rolland in the collection entitled Liber Amicorum Romain Rolland.™ "Ibid., pp. 318, 319.

He applauded the " Unforgettable man " for his highmindedness and creative achievements. Freud asserted that, although he had always supported the idea of " love for mankind," he did so for " sober, economic reasons," for reasons based on sound psycho analytic premises and " not out of sentimentality or idealism." He reiterated his concern about the inevitable contradictions between individuals and society. At stake in this conflict was the preservation of the human species. To alleviate the tensions generated by his "instinctual drives and the world as it is," man's non-destructive impulses counted as much as scientific and technological advances. Alluding to their meeting in May, 1924, Freud expressed his surprise " to find that you appreciate strength and energy so highly, and that you yourself embody so much will-power." The reality of Rolland the man began to clash with Freud's image of the artist as undisciplined, passive, given over to fantasy and incapable of tenacious struggle. After acknowledging Rolland's years of " hardship and suffering" as the "apostle of love for mankind," Freud wished him another decade of " fulfillment." He signed the birthday remembrance with his name and added " aetat. [aged] 70," obtrusively raising the issue of his old age and, perhaps, his imminent death.27 Having recognized that Freud derived enormous satisfaction from his intellectual labor, Rolland's seventieth birthday greeting wished his " friend " long life and good health so that he might continue with his work of enlightenment.

To console Freud, " who will not live long," Zweig continued to support his candidacy for a Nobel Prize.29 Freud corroborated Zweig's observations in a letter to Marie Bonaparte earlier in the same month. There, he mentioned Rolland's letter as particularly gratifying: "Among the written congratulations those that pleased me most came from Einstein, Brandes, Romain Rol land, and Yvette Guilbert." However, Freud's general assessment of the celebration was deflating and insightful; what he said pertained to Rolland's qualified appreciation of his discoveries. Freud realized that his theories had won a grudging acceptance, but even those who recognized his writings had rejected the foundations and practice of psycho analysis: " General impression: The World has acquired a certain respect for my work. But so jar analysis has been accepted only by analysts."30 Freud thanked Rolland for his birthday remembrance in a letter addressed to his " Friend " on May 13, 1926. The letter began and ended on a personal note of flattery and tenderness: Your lines aTe among the most precious things which these days have brought me. Let me thank you for their contents and your manner of address... But when men like you whom I have loved from afar ex press their friendship for me, then a personal ambition of mine is gratified. I enjoy it without questioning whether or not I deserve it; I relish it as a gift. You belong to those who know how to give presents.81 Yet, in the body of the letter, Freud raised questions about the intentionality, substance, and reception of Rolland's creations. What was intimated in earlier letters now became apparent, namely Freud's delineation of sharp oppositions between artistic and idealistic activity and the activity of science. He stated that in contradistinction to Rolland's work, his own 2* Letter, Stefan Zweig to Rolland, May 21, 1926, A. R.

Freud's bitterness about the years of unpopularity of the psychoanalytic movement partially explains the envy and invidiousness of his comparison: Unlike you I cannot count on the love of many people. I have not pleased, comforted, edified them. Nor was this my intention; I only wanted to explore, solve riddles, uncover a little of the truth. This may have given pain to many, benefitted a few, neither of which I consider my fault or my merit.82 Ironically, Freud exaggerated the general expression of " love " for Rolland by " many people." In France particu larly, Rolland had been more or less ignored by the French artistic and critical community despite the fact that the public continued to buy and read his writings. Apart from a tiny group of young non-Communist, Left-wing intellectuals who clustered around the Parisian review, Europe, the majority of the population stigmatized him as anti-French; they had not forgiven his " treason " during the war. Zweig drew a parallel between Rolland's isolation in France and the lack of appreciation for Freud in Vienna; he also saw George Bernard Shaw in a similar situation in England. Genuises paid the price for their brillance by being treated as non persons in their homelands.38 In late 1926, after receiving a copy of a polemical book against Freud written by the French novelist and physician, Jean Bodin,84 Rolland's attention returned briefly to Freud. To correct Bodin's unjudicious critique of psychoanalysis, Rolland stressed the historical value of Freud's theoretical findings, his intellectual honesty, and his role as a courageous forerunner. Bodin conveniently forgot how Freud's work cut through much of the hypocrisy and mystifications of fin de siècle Europe.

It was around 1906 or 7, I think, that I bought the Traumdeutung in Zurich which had just appeared [in second edition]. It opened a monstrous but powerful internal world, wild, hallucinated, a little archaic (like that of Hellenic pre-history) that one carried in oneself, that one knew very well, but that one dared not look full in the face. Abusive error? Disordered vision? Excessive deformation? Yes. But that is worth more than the deliberate and imposed lie in which the mentality of this time lived... We see today of what psychiatric cyclones, of what ethnic convulsions he was the precursor... Every system of thought must be replaced in its time.85 ***** While on vacation in Vienna in July, 1927, Rolland met Marie Bonaparte, who happened to be staying at the same hotel. She and three other disciples of Freud visited him there. His impressions of the Greek princess were mixed: she was " young, robust, laughing," yet confused and brusque in her thinking. Rolland sensed that these young Freudians had not entirely assimilated much of the master's conceptual apparatus, nor had they learned fully Freud's clinical professionalism. They enjoyed their access to the intimate secrets of their patients and played the role of " confessor " with a flirtatious lightness and a flippant curiosity. Furthermore, he learned from Marie Bonaparte and her colleagues that Freud was closed off to music, that he had a " total, irrémissible occlusion " to it. More interesting than the fact that Freud neither understood nor felt anything for music was that it troubled him. Rolland was baffled by this bit of information: on the one hand, he won dered why Freud had not perceived the cathartic possibilities of music; and on the other hand, if music made Freud uneasy, s' Letter, Rolland to Jean Bodin, Dec. 10, 1926, in Jean Bodin, ed., Jean Christophe et Armel.

Freud's insensitivity to music caused Rolland to speculate: " And how could he ever read into the sub conscious of souls, if he does not possess the key to the language of the subconscious? " 86 Freud sent Rolland a copy of the first edition of The Future of an Illusion, first published in Vienna in November, 1927. This triggered off an intriguing debate on the origins, nature, and significance of religious sensation. Though not his first sustained analysis of cultural problems or religion, he used the insights gleaned from his clinical and theoretical findings to polemicize against religious insti tutions, doctrines, and rituals, specifically the belief in an anthropomorphic God. In the twentieth century, Freud contended, religion represented a retrograde world view; religious believers perpetuated a body of ideas which had originated at a relatively backward stage of mankind's develop ment. Since the psychical origins of religion were illusions which arose from the child's ambivalent feelings for his father, his need for protection and his longing for the father's love, mankind would never advance if it did not jettison its fixation on infantile wish fulfillments. More than illusions, religious beliefs were similar to a " universal obsessional neurosis of humanity; " they implied a repudiation of reality, a refusal to accept adulthood, and a consoling retreat into "blissful hallucinatory confusion." However, the thrust of Freud's attack on religion was that religion no longer assisted modern man in reconciling himself to civilization, to the regulations, instinctual renunciations, and coercions demanded of the individual while living in society. Religion would only increase the uncertainty of man's con dition. It could not accommodate him to life's compromises, to the obligations of labor, to the sublimations and repressions necessary for survival. Because religion was regressive and reactionary, it provided man with an obfuscating compensation for his misery. Besides distorting the childhood of many people through proscriptive interdictions and the inculcation of guilt, religion interfered with the establishment of a more 88 Romain Rolland, Journal intime, Oct., 1926-July, 1927, pp. 111-112,</page><page sequence="20">20 David James Fisher sensible basis for coping with the demands of civilization and grounding ethical demands. What was needed was an irreli gious " education to reality." The oppressive nature of civilization could be ameliorated if man would apply the legacy of his scientific conquests, his reason, and his experience. Freud concluded his book with an impassioned defense of science and a plea for science to weaken and eventually over throw religious faith. Optimistically, he judged that science itself was not an illusion, but rather an impartial instrument, a tool for research, which presupposed accurate observation and reasoning in order to arrive at empirically verifiable and predictable results. These results were commensurate with the laws of external reality. Unlike religion, science was built upon working hypotheses which could be modified or discarded in the light of new knowledge. Just as science was his hope, so too was it mankind's: " The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest till it has gained a hearing."87 Rolland reacted to the essay in a letter addressed to Freud on December 5, 1927: Thank you very much for having kindly sent me your lucid and valiant little book. With a calm, common sense and a moderate tone, it tears the blindfold from eternal adolescents, all of us, whose amphibious mind floats between the illusion of yesterday and ... the illusion of tomorrow. Your analysis of religions is fair. But I would have liked to see you analyze spontaneous religious feeling or, more exactly, religious sensation... I understand by that—quite independently of all dogma, of all Credo, of every Church organization, of every Holy Book, of all hope in a personal survival, etc.—the simple and direct fact of the sensation of the "eternal" (which may very well not be eternal, but simply without perceptible limits, and in that way oceanic).

But as it is common to thousands (millions) of men presently living with thousands (millions) of individual nuances, it is possible to submit it to analysis with an approximate exactitude. I think that you will classify it among the Zwangs neurosen. But I have had the occasion to establish often its rich and beneficial energy, whether amongst the religious souls of the West, Christian or non-Christian— whether amongst the great spirits of Asia who have become familiar to me—among whom I count friends, and I am going, in a forthcoming book, to study two almost con temporary personalities (the first is from the end of the 19th century; the second died in the first years of the 20th), who have demonstrated a genius of thought and action powerfully regenerative for their country and for the world. I, myself, am familiar with this sensation. Throughout my whole life I have never lacked it; and I have always found it a source of vital renewal.

I add that this " oceanic " feeling has nothing to do with my personal aspirations. Personally, I aspire to eternal rest; survival has no attraction for me. But the sensation that I feel is thrust upon me as a fact. It is a contact. And since I have recognized it to be identical (with multiple nuances) amongst numerous living souls, it has allowed me to understand that there was the true sub terranean source of religious energy—which next is tapped, canalized, and dessicated by the Churches', to the point that one could say that it is inside the Churches (wherever they are) that one finds the least of true " religious " feeling.</page><page sequence="22">22 David James Fisher Eternal confusion of words, the same one which means now obedience or faith in a dogma, or a word (or a tra dition) , now: free vital gushing [jaillissement vital]. Please believe, dear friend, in my affectionate respect. Romain Rolland38 He appreciated the value and courage of Freud's book even to the point of accepting his critique of established religion. What he found lacking in The Future of an Illusion was a psychoanalytic inquiry into spontaneous religion sensation. Such a scientific approach might introduce an empirical dimension and a certain conceptual clarity into the discussion of the " oceanic " feeling. He tentatively defined religious sensation as a pro longed intuitive feeling of contact with the eternal, a feeling of vastness, of living in or with immense forces. Rolland attested to the reality of this subjective communion with the timeless and ineffable but ubiquitous sensation both from his recent research on Hindu mysticism and from first hand evidence; he confessed that he had experienced the sensation throughout his entire life. Yet he qualified his admission of his religious nature by stating that within him the operation of critical reason and the spontaneous feelings of the " oceanic " were not mutually exclusive. Thus, he too could distinguish reality from unreality, and he was not deceived by illusion. Rolland believed that " oceanic " energies were more or less identical in all religious souls, that they derived from the same " subterranean source," and that they might be an untapped mine of world unity and renewal. Totally unlike the ob jectifications of religion into institutions, dogmas, rituals, and the false promises of salvation, religious sensation was an experience shared by millions. Because of the extensiveness of the experience, the reality of the " oceanic " had to be acknow ledged; then and only then could this " free vital gushing " be comprehended by a disinterested analysis. Rolland's letter touched a sensitive nerve. In The Future of an Illusion, Freud had glossed over rather than analyzed ®8 Letter, Rolland to Freud, Dec. 5, 1927, in Un Beau Visage A Tous Sens.

Tactically, he evaded such a discussion either by asking rhetorical questions or by dismissing these states as rare, specific, and difficult to interpret. Moreover, he justified his dismissal of religious feeling in ad hominem fashion, albeit in the same of science.89 Freud delayed his answer to Rolland's letters for nine teen months, a period in which he wrote little and suffered a great deal from his illness. While composing the final draft of Civilization and Its Discontents in the summer of 1929, Freud's thoughts returned to his friend's suggestions on religious sensations; he thought of beginning his essay with a pre liminary assessment of the " oceanic " feeling. " Beset with doubts " about the propriety of using private material for his book, he wanted the French writer's permission to quote his " private remarks " before the work was published. These interpretative passages would serve as an addendum to The Future of Illusion, as a transition between the two works. They were not related integrally to the central themes of the new book. " My essay could be given another introduction without any loss, perhaps it is altogether not indispensable." Furthermore, Freud stated that Rolland's December, 1927 letter had disturbed him, adding the disclaimer: " I always think of you with feelings of most respectful friendship." Your letter of December 5, 1927 containing remarks about a feeling you describe as " oceanic " has left me no peace. It happens that in a new work which lies before me still uncompleted I am making a starting point of this remark. I mention this " oceanic " feeling and am trying to interpret it from the point of view of our psychology. The essay moves on to other subjects, deals with happiness, civilization, and the sense of guilt. I don't mention your name but nevertheless drop a hint that points towards you.40 Even though he had forgotten the exact text of his letter, Rolland was " honored " to learn that he had urged Freud on " The Future of an Illusion, pp. 28, 31-32. 40 Letter, Freud to Rolland, July 14, 1929, Freud Letters, p. 388.</page><page sequence="24">24 David James Fisher to new investigations of religious sensation; he granted him full permission to begin his essay with a discussion of the " oceanic." Just as Freud's letter crystallized the themes of Civilization and Its Discontents, Rolland's letter indicated that his forthcoming three volume work, Essay on Mysticism and Action in Living India, would summarize several varieties of French, European, and Asian mysticism. The thesis of the essay was that barriers between the Orient and Occident were superficial, that profound and spontaneous spiritual links existed between the two civilizations. " Oceanic " feelings, Rolland contended, provided an essential bridge between cultures. " I have been struck... that it is not true at all that East and West are two worlds apart from one another—but that both are the arms of the same river of thought. And I have recognized in both the same ' Ocean river.' " On the one hand, his study of Hindu mysticism had corroborated and deepened his knowledge of the wide scale presence of the " oceanic " sensation; and on the other hand, his reading of classical treatises on yoga had provided him with physiological evidence to support his claims. Finally, he promised to send Freud copies of his work soon after it was published—the first volume in late 1929 and the second in January, 1930.41 Three days later, Freud answered that he could not accept Rolland's permission to use his private discussion of the " oceanic " until he had reread the original December 5, 1927 letter; to expedite matters, Freud forwarded it. He then expressed a confused series of thoughts with respect to his correspondence with the French writer: " I possess so few letters from you that I do not like the idea of renouncing the return of this, your first one. I am not normally a hunter of relics, so please for give this weakness."i2 Contrary to Freud's statement, Rolland's December, 1927 letter had been the fourth in the series sent by the French writer to Freud, the first dated back to 1923. Freud's faulty memory arose from the repression of some unpleasurable feeling. Freud's display of possessiveness, the awkwardness of his prose, followed by an uncharacteristic lapse 41 Letter, Rolland to Freud, July 17, 1929, A. R. R. " Letter, Freud to Rolland, July 20, 1929, Freud Letters, p. 388.</page><page sequence="25">Sigmund Freud and Romain Rolland 25 of memory, suggests resistance vis-à-vis Rolland letter. Some thing about Rolland or something in Rolland's letter had disturbed Freud's memory.43 Freud cautioned Rolland not to expect a systematic psy choanalytic interpretation of religious sensation, but rather an approach which would sort out its origins and primacy. " But please don't expect from my small effort any evaluation of the ' oceanic ' feeling. I am experimenting only with an analytical diversion of it; I am clearing it out of the way, so to speak." 44 Freud concluded by expressing his mixed feelings towards Rolland. He felt a distance from, yet an attraction to his friend's various universes. Whenever Freud spoke of his personal limitations, he did so with an edge of ironic self defense. This is particularly evident when he and Rolland discuss their antithetical responses to the less tangible aspects of human existence. In switching from " I " to " we," Freud emphasized the characterological as well as the epistemological differences between the music lover, artist, mystic, and the psychoanalyst: How remote from me are the worlds in which you move! To me mysticism is just as closed a book as music. I can not imagine reading all the literature which, according to your letter, you have studied. And yet it is easier for you than for us to read the human soul!45 Almost immediately after receiving the letter, Rolland replied that his position on the " oceanic " had not altered substantially; thus, his " great friend " could begin his new book with a discussion of the concept. He added that " it is difficult for me to think that mysticism and music are foreign to you." This signified disequilibrium in Freud's outlook and mental makeup. It suggested that Freud's suspicion of intuition cognition sprang from an overvaluation of man's rational faculties. Roland was aware of living two lives simul taneously: one was of the mind and one was of the emotions. Unlike Freud, he made no value judgment as to which was «s Sigmund Freud, The Psycho pathology of Everyday Life (1901), Standard Edition, VI, pp. 4-7, 146-147, 239-240, 267-268. 44 Letter, Freud to Rolland, July 20, 1929, Freud Letters, p. 389. " Ibid.</page><page sequence="26">26 David James Fisher more real or superior. While not denying the uniqueness and strength of these competing forces, Rolland asserted that man was capable of reconciling them and of achieving a desir able wholeness. As a corrective to Freud's imbalance, Rolland offered the Heraclitian and musical ideal—the task of striving for the resolution of clashing forces. For him, the " highest joy " consisted in the perfect realization of a psychological harmony. Actualizing this ideal implied neither the subor dination of " seeing, believing, and doubting " to the unfettered play of the unconscious, nor did it preclude the role of intuitive and non-rational forces.46 Having completed the draft of his book in July 1929, Freud published Civilization and Its Discontents late that year, before Rolland's three volume work appeared. His esteem for Rolland—his allusions to the French writer as " one of the exceptional few," " the friend whom I so much honor "—went hand in hand with efforts to consider Rolland's objections to The Future of an Illusion. Clearly, Freud had Rolland in mind when he spoke of the " great men " who were admired by their contemporaries, who did not use " false standards of measurement," and who comprehended " what is of value in life." In a footnote added in 1931, Freud ended the secrecy and stated explicitly: " I need no longer hide the fact that the friend spoken of in the text is Romain Rolland." 47 In the first chapter, Freud discussed Rolland's assertion that the " oceanic " was the vital source of religious energy. Yet, he began his analysis by identifying Rolland with the defense of illusion. He pointed to Liluli (1919) as a poem in which the French author had " once praised the magic of illusion." 48 Here, Freud was mistaken; Liluli was a play and not a poem, and although it contained some verse, it was an Aristophanic farce which attacked war in particular as man kind's greatest folly and in general all those illusions and lies which had contributed to mass destruction.49 Secondly, " Letter, Rolland to Freud, July 19, 1929, A.

Thus, the essay opens with a combination of praise and slight blame, and a touch of self-conscious reserve toward Rolland. Evidently, Rolland's position caused Freud "no small diffi culty." As he moved into the interpretative sections, Freud sandwiched his argument between understatements and qualifi cations. He admitted honestly that he had never experienced religious sensations, and that they were extremely unsuitable for psychoanalytic evaluation: " I cannot discover this' oceanic ' feeling in myself. It is not easy to deal scientifically with feelings." 50 And again: " Let me admit once more that it is very difficult for me to work with these almost intangible quantities." 61 After summarizing accurately (without directly quoting Rolland's description of the " oceanic " feeling), Freud focused his discussion not on the physiological characteristics of the sensation, but rather " on the ideational content which is most readily associated with the feeling." 52 He suggested that the " oceanic " feeling consoled man regarding his mortality and the uncertainty of much of his existence. Without denying the existence of the sensation, he questioned whether it was the source of man's religious needs or the most elementary of man's emotions. " From my own experience I could not convince myself of the primary nature of such a feeling."63 The " oceanic " emanated from a stage in the child's develop ment where there were fewer distinctions between the ego and the world, where an " intimate bond " connected the child's self and his immediate surroundings, especially his mother. In adults, it was not contradictory for the feeling of " oneness 60 Civilization and Its Discontents, p. 65. 11 Ibid. p. 72. "Ibid., p. 65. Rather than evaluate the physiological basis of mysticism, or discuss the link between mysticism and trances, Freud dropped the issues by quoting a text from Schiller. Possibly, the unnamed " another friend of mine " is an allusion to Rolland, (pp. 72-72.) " Ibid., p. 65.</page><page sequence="28">28 David James Fisher with the universe " to coexist with those more developed stages of the ego in which the ego functioned simultaneously to separate the self from the external world and to defend the self against the " sensations of unpleasure." Since psycho analysis posited that no phase of the psyche was ever destroyed, it followed that Rolland's " oceanic " sensations were preserved residues of primitive feelings which could be differentiated from other more mature aspects of the mind, specifically its critical capacity. Though there was no necessary disparity between feeling the " oceanic " and being capable of conscious " reality-testing," Freud indicated that pathology often resulted when one blurred the boundary line between the ego and the external world." However, in granting that the " oceanic " was " a purely subjective fact," Freud contested that it was the fundamental source of religious energy. While he traced such all-embracing feelings to " an " early phase of the mind's development, he held that it did not incarnate man's strongest and most recurring fears and wishes. Thus, he relegated Rolland's " oceanic " feeling into the background as a secondary mani festation of the ego, and repeated emphatically the main thesis of The Future of an Illusion with respect to the neurotic origins of religion: The derivation of religious needs from the infant's helplessness and the longing for the father aroused by it seem to me incontrovertible, especially since the feeling is not simply prolonged from childhood days, but is permanently sustained by fear of the superior power of Fate. I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for the father's protection.55 Hence, it was the oedipal configuration deriving from infantile helplessness which furnished the needs and ambivalent energies in religious believers. As for as the origins of Rolland's " oceanic " sentiment, Freud tossed out two speculations, both of which he left in "Ibid., p. 66. 68 Ibid., p. 72 (my italics).</page><page sequence="29">Sigmund Freud and Romain Rolland 29 fragmentary form. First, the " oceanic " might correspond to the narcissistic function of the ego, maximized to include a feeling of love for the world (".. .might seek something like the restoration of limitless narcissism "). Secondly, the feeling might derive from the ego's efforts to ward off concrete dangers in the external world by means of a total identification with the universe. The " oceanic " was consoling because, through the process of incorporation, the threatening aspects of reality were neutralized and/or absorbed ("a first attempt at a religious consolation, as though it were another way of dis claiming the danger which the ego recognizes as threatening it from the external world ") .*• Rolland published his most sustained defense of the " oceanic " sensation in his three volume Essay on Mysticism and Action in Living India. While answering Freud's critique of mysticism in the introduction and appendix of the work, he also challenged traditional postulates of scientific investi gation in general and of psychoanalysis in particular. This did not, however, prevent Rolland from pressing for a scientific inquiry into mystical experience. European scientists and psychoanalysts were obstructing the efforts of civilizational interpénétration by waging a battle against religion on two fronts: they condemned the religious consciousness without having experimented with the fact of religious experience, and they confused the articulation and ritualization of religious feelings with the intensity, durability, and imaginative possibilities of such " spontaneous eruptions." 57 To correct the superficial treatment of religion by twentieth century's " extreme rationalists," Rolland made a case for Hindu mysticism. Through the study of two exemplary Indian personalities, and by means of comparisons with Wes tern forms of mysticism and music,68 he provided the details 56 Ibid., p. 72. 57 Romain Rolland, The Life of Ramakrishna (Calcutta, 1970), translated by E. F. Malcolm-Smith, pp. 4-5. This was first published as Essai sur la mystique et l'action de l'Inde vivante: La Vie de Ramakrishna (Paris, 1929). BS At the same time that Rolland was writing on Hindu mysticism, he was working on the early volumes of his massive study of Beethoven; see, Romain Rolland, Beethoven.

The section entitled " Concerning Mystic Introversion and the Scientific Value for Its Knowledge of the Real " presup posed that science and religion were not incompatible. Despite their distinct modes of application, both were roads to freedom, ways of knowing and attaining the truth. The problem with the modern scientific approach to religion was its tendency to analyze externals and its commensurate inability to penetrate to the depths of the religious mind. Nonetheless, the " oceanic " sensation was not comprehensible by known methods of the "intellectual dialectic." Consequently, Rolland urged that scientists study transcendent states of consciousness and deep introversion (mysticism) —he borrowed the term from C. G. Jung—in order to complete their explanations of the mind's total activity.69 To study mysticism objectively, the spirit of William James, not of Freud, had to be emulated.60 Rolland held that scientists should stop dissociating reason from intuition. Scientists should acknowledge the legitimacy of " generative intuitions" in all mental activity, including theory building and interpretation. They should be aware that another reality existed " outside of reason and the senses." The pro ject was to delve into the working of the " oceanic " feeling with the hypothesis that mysticism was another dimension of human experience, not an isolated eccentricity. By exploring this state of consciousness, science could enrich itself, discover internal laws for mystical activity, at the same time that it made available to others non-rational modes of discipline, discourse, and ways of reaching the truth. To handle the difficulties of all inquiries into mystical experience, Rolland called for a 1930).

He suggested that the observer identify with and experience the sensation of the object observed: " the Plotinian identity of the seer and thing seen." 61 In proposing a psychoanalytic investigation into the feelings which were the religious sensation, rather than the ideational elements clustered around it, Rolland was antici pating subsequent revisions of classical psychoanalysis as theory and practice. By suggesting the end to the separation between analyst and analysand, he foreshadowed some of the " therapies of commitment " which challenged Freudian hegemony during Freud's lifetime and after his death. His desire to integrate Freud's work on the unconscious with the discoveries of spon taneous religion and creative art, paralleled the approach of Jung on a certain level. Rolland's writings also prefigured the synthetic studies of Norman O. Brown and Herbert Marcuse.62 Rolland hypothesized that non-institutional spirituality might be a strong way of mediating between man as he was then and as he could become. One could not afford to ignore the " oceanic " sentiment because it might be the source of universal energies capable of uniting mankind. The task for the future was to create man, to " reawaken God in man." 68 He defined his concept of religion organically: it was " perpetual birth," constant striving, unrelenting aspiration. If one displayed a courageous attitude in the quest for truth, if one grasped an end which superseded individual life, and if one were prepared for long periods of self-sacrifice, one could be considered religious. Rolland's stance was that of the monist; he assumed that men and societies were unitary wholes with no independent parts. The divine was an idea force which lived in every man. This " living-unity " connected 91 The Life of Vivekananda, p. 342. " Norman O. Brown, Love's Body, (New York 1966), pp. 82, 88-89, 141, 211.

Rolland described this divine essence as mythical: it existed beyond the categories of time, space, and causality. He used water imagery to objectify its cyclical and creative qualities: I belong to a land of rivers... Now of all rivers the most sacred is that which gushes out eternally from the depths of the soul and from its rocks and glaciers. Therein lies primeval Force and that is what I call religion. Every thing belongs to this river of the Soul, flowing from the dark unplumbed reservoirs of our Being, the conscious, realized, and mastered Being ... From the source to the sea, from the sea to the source, everything consists of the same Energy, of the Being without beginning and without End.64 Rolland speculated that the " oceanic " feeling might be the generating force, the deep structure, of all religious existence. The self's feeling of oneness with the environment, the end to the distinction between subject and object, might be the agency of the future unification of mankind. Furthermore, the primary gratification of those who experienced the " oceanic " was real and omnipresent. As a disseminator of Hindu mystical thought, Rolland also tried to destroy the sterotyped misunderstandings about Indian religiosity. He pointed to India's movement for inde pendence in order to illustrate that mysticism need not be socially passive. Gandhi's life and work proved that Hindu spiritual forces could be harnassed into purposeful social and political channels. Rolland disagreed with the commonplace that introversion meant flight, that it was an escape from life's conflicts. The true nature of mystical activity, as practiced by Ramakrishna, and expecially Vivekananda, was struggle. More over, since mysticism did not have a " sporadic character," as William James had written, but " a daily, methodical quality," Europeans had to realize that mystical enlighten ment was another form of self-discovery. Mysticism led to the 84 The Life of Ramakrishna, pp. 6-7.</page><page sequence="33">Sigmund Freud and Romain Rolland 33 purification of ideas. The realm of the pure idea was a place where energies collected in compressed but powerful form, and where they were in natural harmony with the universe: And it would be strange if mental joy were a sign of error. The mistrust shown by some masters of psychoanalysis for the free natural play of the mind, rejoicing in its own possession—the stigma they imprint upon it of " narcissism " and " auto-eroticism "—betrays in them unknowingly a reverse kind of religious asceticism and renunciation.65 In turning to his critique of modern psychological theory, Rolland's aim was to show how leading theoreticians placed certain aspects of religious sensation into a preconceived, narrow theoretical framework66 He thought that Ribot, Janet, Bleuler, and Freud had erred in extending their analysis of " functional disorganization " to the entire realm of the mind. Freud's use of the concept of " regression " sprang from his own notion of a hierarchy of the mind's activities. Since he accorded science and the exercise of reason the highest place, Freud denigrated religion as a neurotic residue of an earlier and now surpassed stage of development. The term " re gression " carried a " pejorative sense." Rather than disparage unconscious functions of the mind with regard to religious sensation, pure speculation, or imaginative activity, Rolland asserted that these activities could be as disinterested as scienti fic pursuits. Introversion worked by going back into one's unconscious in order to move forward into enlightenment. More significantly, these early, if not primary, operations of the mind were " those which disappear last—they are the foun dations of Being."67 Despite Freud's " customary energy " in defending estab lished scientific laws, Rolland challenged his uncritical faith in evolutionary theories. What Roland stressed was the indestructible and universal aspects of man's spiritual nature, not the mind's more recent—and less firmly anchored— " The Life of Vivekananda, pp. 343-344.

He accepted a modified Lamarckian view that the human condition was the product of innate characteristics (heredity) interacting with acquired characteristics (man's adaptation to his environment). Freud's error was that he downgraded man's innate possessions.68 Similarly, Roland rejected Freud's implicit scale of values vis-à-vis the " supreme function of the mind." He excoriated the sharp divisions set up between the reality and pleasure principles, the opposition between action in the external, material world and creative representation in a fantasy or dream world. He advocated the integration of generative intuitions and scientific method: But if this great effort is rejected with the disdainful gesture of the exclusive rationalists, and particularly of the psychopathologists who throw discredit on " the criterion of intellectual satisfaction " or—as the great Freud says with austere scorn—on " the pleasure principle which is in his eyes that of the " maladjusted "—those who reject it are far less the servants of the "real" as they imagine themselves to be, than of a proud and Puritan faith whose prejudices have become their second nature.®9 Rolland judged that Freud's conceptual apparatus so depre ciated intuitive and instinctual functions of the mind that his theory lacked proportion. Consequently, psychoanalysts failed to comprehend how unconscious forms of cognition were legitimate in their own right, and how intuition blended with rational activity. " The irreverant observer is tempted to say, ' Physician, heal thyself! ' " 70 Because of their biases, and because of the limited, how ever, innovative, nature of their conquests, Rolland questioned why psychoanalysts appointed themselves the " standard bearers " for the reality principle. Why did they circumscribe the boundaries and functions of the real? And ultimately were scientists the best judges of objective and subjective reality? n «8 Ibid., pp. 334-337.

" Man was not yet," Rolland concluded, but man would become man through education, meditation, and above all, through renunciation and sacrifice." Rolland mentioned proudly to Stefan Zweig that he had not only " provoked " several themes in Civilization and Its Discontents, but also that he was the " unnamed friend " whom Freud had hinted at in the first pages when he discussed the " oceanic feeling." He regretted that Freud's essay had appeared before his three volume work on Hindu mysticism was published; if Freud had only waited he would have found ample " experimental materials " of the " oceanic " feeling to submit to analysis: And his argumentation would have been more precise and efficacious with these materials. Above all he would have seen that contemporary man is not involved alone, that this issue of soul proceeded without interruption for centuries, and that it be charged with no symptom of weakness. Error or truth, what's the difference? Every thing is, perhaps, an illusion. But every lived illusion is a fact.78 ***** Fulfilling his promise, Rolland sent Freud his three volume work immediately after its publication in Paris in 1930. In his letter of thanks for the gift, written on January 19, 1930, Freud replied playfully to some of Rolland's criticism of psychoanalysis: tradition, in contemporary psychology, aesthetics, educational psychology, and scientific methodology.

That you call me " grand " here I have taken quite well; I cannot object to your irony when it is mixed with so much amiability.74 Freud's old resentment with respect to his break with Jung resurfaced here. He quickly dismissed his former disciple's writings as partially mystical—a denigration that Rolland would surely not appreciate. ".. .the distinction between ' extrovert ' and ' introvert ' derives from C. G. Jung, who is a bit of a mystic himself and hasn't belonged to us for years. We don't attach any great importance to the distinction and are well aware that people can both at the same time, and usually are." 75 Freud contested Rolland's allegation that various psycho analytic concepts were inherently pejorative; he argued that they were non-normative descriptive terms. Rolland was simply wrong in imputing a value judgment to Freud's con ceptual terminology: ... our terms such as regression, narcissism, pleasure principle are of a purely descriptive nature and don't carry within themselves any valuation. The mental pro cesses may change direction or combine forces with each other; for instance even reflecting is a regressive process without losing any of its dignity or importance in being so.76 Without elaborating them, Freud then affirmed that psychoanalysis had priorities and a hierarchy of values. Since psychoanalysis was a collateral branch of science, not a Weltanschauung, he conceived of its basic function as a therapeutic one. The therapeutic goal was neither to furnish a key to the meaning of life nor to chart a course for mankind's unification. Its objectives were more humble. Above all else, psychoanalysis was designed so that individuals could 74 Letter, Freud to Rolland, Jan. 19, 1930, Freud Letters, p. 392. 75 Ibid. 78 Ibid.</page><page sequence="37">Sigmund Freud and Romain Rolland 37 comprehend their limitations and adjust to their external reality. Finally, psychoanalysis also has its scale of values, but its sole aim is to enhance the harmony of the Ego which is expected successfully to mediate between the claims of the instinctual life (the " Id ") and those of the external world, thus between inner and outer reality." Mysticism, Freud added, might provide answers to the various metaphysical puzzles of human existence, as well as an intuitive means of exploring man's unconscious. But the problem with knowledge gained by irrational means was that it did not enhance, and might even weaken, the ego which was continually barraged by hostile forces. The external world remained a threat, and man was obliged to cope with its demands regardless of the profundity of his insights into the " soul's " vicissitudes. Freud's impasse with Rolland on these issue appeared total: We seem to diverge rather far in the role we assign to intuition. Your mystics rely on it to teach them how to solve the riddle of the universe; we believe that it cannot reveal to us anything but primitive, instinctual impulses and attitudes—highly valuable for an embryology of the soul when correctly interpreted, but worthless for orien tation in the alien, external world.78 Freud's critique of Rolland's mysticism, of his use of intuition, and his search for integrated unities, was destined to become the orthodox Freudian reaction to later philosophical and Utopian expressions of belief. According to the critique, mystics (and idealists) were immature, retrograde, and es capist. They retreated from external reality out of fear or because of an inability to cope with the compromises and submissions that social life demanded. As such, the solutions they posed were fallacious because they rested on metaphysical il Ibid. 78 Ibid., pp. 392-393.</page><page sequence="38">38 David James Fisher foundations and childhood wishes.79 Freud concluded his letter on a conciliatory note. He realized that his half-private, half-public controversy with Rolland was deadlocked, that neither was likely to yield to the other's position. Since his feelings for the French writer were " warm," he wanted to end the debate less disputatiously. For the reason, he shifted his point of view in the letter from the personal " I " to the less personal " we " form. Nevertheless, he made one last point about his own epistemological orientation which contrasted implicitly with Rolland's desire for a grand synthesis. Given the limited nature of man's knowledge about the world and himself, Freud affirmed (in the " I " form) that there were certain phenomena which remained inexplicable at the present hour. He refused to prophesy about the future, but, in addition, he hoped his idealistic friend would not mistake him for a complete sceptic: Should our paths cross once more in life, it would be pleasant to discuss all this. From a distance a cordial salutation is better than polemics. Just one more thing: I am not an out-and-out sceptic. Of one thing I am abso lutely positive: there are certain things we cannot know now.80 The last paragraph of this remarkably condensed letter clarifies the first paragraph of the same letter, which had opened conspicuously with a joke. The joke itself, as Freudian theory instructs us, posed both the outline of the problem and a sketch of its solution: I shall now try with your guidance to penetrate into the Indian jungle from which until now an uncertain blending of Hellenic love of proportion, Jewish sobriety, and philistine timidity have kept me away.

As a scientist, a Jew who had mastered pagan cultures, and a cultivated Central European intellectual who passed judg ments on artistic creation, Freud was unintimidated by the " alien " realm of Indian religiosity. (Besides associating it with the id, perhaps he identified the " Indian jungle " with passivity and femininity.) Thus, the humor plays a defensive role. At this juncture in the Freud-Rolland relationship, temperament, intellectual inclination, artistic appreciation, historical role, and world view both converged and clashed. Freud's feelings were unmistakenly divided: he felt a blend of attraction and re pulsion, respect and envy, and, above all, the strange sensation that Rolland and he were utterly different. Rather than spoil the friendship with a serious polemic, and a permanent breach, Freud called a truce. The conflict had entered an insoluble stage, and Freud managed it by letting it drop. As he aptly said: " But it isn't easy to pass beyond the limits of one's nature." Clearly, he was not going to transcend his back ground, age, personality, or theoretical bent. Rolland could accomplish this no more than he. However, both men's final views on the " oceanic " had yet to be expressed, and Freud's mixed feelings for Rolland would re-emerge in another context in 1956. ***** Rolland mentioned to Charles Baudouin that his work on Indian mysticism had precipitated a controversy with Freud. He explained that the old master had rejected the categories of " introversion " and " extroversion," associating them with Jung's mystical inclinations. "I have exchanged several letters with Freud concerning my work. He defended himself about condemning any one of the two forces of the mind centripetal, centrifugal; and he flung back the error to Jung." Though there is no evidence that Rolland knew of the Freud/ Jung split of 1913, he recopied Freud's sentence in German si Ibid., p. 392.</page><page sequence="40">40 David James Fisher (" who is a bit of a mystic himself and hasn't belonged to us for years "), and he added parenthetically: " that smells of excommunication." 82 Freud sent Rolland a copy of the second edition (1931) of Civilization and Its Discontents with an amusing dedication inscribed on the first page: "The Terrestrial Animal to his great oceanic Friend." (Seinem grossen, ozeanischen Freund, das Landtier, 18.3.1931) This confirmed that Rolland had been the " unconscious inspiration " of the first pages of Freud's book. The dedication from Freud impressed him as being " ironic and affectionate."83 Freud's dedication is crucial because the terrestrial animal/ oceanic dichotomy links the intellectual and personal relation ships of Freud and Rolland. In their conflict over religious sensation, the disputants had not met on the same footing. Consequently, no decision could be reached. Yet, there had been dialogue and an affective bond was established between the two. Rolland was everything that Freud was not; thus Freud, the scientific psychologist, identified himself with the material world, with the concrete, with intellectual life which had broken through to the pre-conscious or conscious stage. For Freud, Rolland swam in the boundless waters of eternity and universal love—his mind held back at the stage of the unconscious. Freud's fraternal feelings were mixed with feelings of infatuation for the French writer. Rolland was a gentile, a practising mystic, a music lover, a philosophical idealist, and a humanitarian writer who uplifted and consoled mankind. It is quite possible that Freud saw in Rolland various facets of his own personality, elements that he had long suppressed, such as his susceptibility to mystical ideas, his own creative aspirations, and his desire to serve mankind. Using Freud's seveny-fifth birthday as an occasion, Rolland pursued the theme of reconciliation in the personal tone and 82 Letter, Rolland to Charles Baudoin, March IB, 1930, A. R. R. In a letter to Baudouin dated April 16, 1929, Rolland stated that most " masters o£ pathological psychology " were better suited to be observed as case histories than to serve as " model observers Their incapacity to grasp religious sensations revealed a loss of " contact with living, full, and healthy reality."

He felt a moral bond with Freud because of the psychoanalyst's fearless and disinterested search for truth. What was " psychologically curious " about Rolland's own mind was the balancing of three facets of his personality: feeling, knowing, and desiring. In him, feeling corresponded to the " oceanic," knowing corresponded to doubt (on the model of Montaigne), and desiring corresponded to " nothing— to total, boundless effacement." Thus, Freud's juxtaposition of his own earth-bound nature and Rolland's " oceanic " im pulses, the concrete and the abstract, the material and the metaphysical, were forced and unnecessarily antagonistic op positions. To see without illusions was not incompatible with feeling a connection with past and present humanity. He reiterated that the " oceanic " sensation was an innate feature of the human personality, that it existed objectively in men of all historical periods and classes regardless of ethnological or geopolitical boundaries. Since he had published his volumes on Indian mysticism, echoes had reached him from many sources, including Austrian ones, which corroborated the wide scale presence of such " invisible forces." The form and substance of this " vital feature " of man's existence remained to be studied; the contours of the " truth " of the " oceanic " remained a task for men of the future to determine. Arguing from a Jamesian pragmatic point of view, he opposed the analysis of intuitive sensations with preconceived categories. Philosophers and activists would be foolish to neglect the impalpable but highly explosive nature of " oceanic " forces. Rolland proclaimed that he lived by the motto " be what you must be "/" do what you must do " not simply out of infantile rebellion or delight in his own uniqueness, but rather as a necessary point of departure in his quest for human abundance and serenity.84 Freud, deeply moved by Rolland's intimate tone and struck by the tenacity of his defense of intuitive forces, replied: You answered my pleasantry with the most precious infor mation about your own person. My profound thanks for it. ** Letter, Rolland to Freud, May 3, 1931, A. R.

Farewell!85 Distance, age and illness would prevent a cordial reso lution of their debate and a fresh restoration of their friendship. Most crucially, Freud admitted his own ambivalence about Rolland: his feeling of " mysterious attraction " and yet of " our being so different." The unusual force of the letter derived partially from Freud's sense of guilt about his mixed feelings toward his friend. The double feeling was accentuated by the ever-present consciousness of his impending death. Rolland reacted to Freud's May; 1931 letter in an ex change with Zweig in early June of that year. " Exchange of interesting letters with Professor Freud. The last received from him had an affectionate accent which touched me. It hinted at the feeling that death was near." He claimed that Freud's postulation of Eros and the death instinct paralleled his own intuitions concerning this metapsychological opposition: " The enlargement of his theory (to this double element, life and death) corresponds curiously to the self-confession that I made to him." 86 Rolland might have added that Freud had compressed these twin concepts into powerful emotions when expressing his secret feelings about Rolland. ***** A contemporary historian has argued that the origins of psychoanalysis were " counterpolitical." 87 After summa rizing Freud's positions in the debate on the " oceanic," this conceptual frame can be broadened by adding that the con 85 Letter, Freud to Rolland, May, 1981, Freud Letten, p. 405. 8« Letter, Rolland to Stefan Zweig, June 6, 1931, A.

Despite his sensitivity to literary, plastic, and representational forms of artistic expression, Freud was disturbed by and distrustful of artistic creations which had their origin in the realm of the id. While his theory neutra lized politics by positing the primacy of instincts and sexuality, it attacked religion and irrational doctrines as culturally repressive. Mystics and believers acted immaturely because they resolved falsely the perennial tensions between individuals and their social and cultural milieus. A great opponent of fully integrated world views, Freud saw the world as per manently atomized; one could not wish away the myriad levels of the individual's estrangement in society. Man was by definition sick, divided, and incapable of escaping from the submissions required for his daily existence. Those who postulated syntheses or liberation on an abstract plane were misleading men, soothing them with promises of individual transformation, happiness, and perfection when only infor mation and compromise were really possible. From the Freudian viewpoint, the best that could be expected was the therapeutic goal: accommodation to the external world as it was, amelioration of man's painful internal conflicts, and fortification of the ego against internal and external assaults on it.88 On the other hand, Rolland's point of reference was idealistic, prophetic, and synthetic. His view of human nature presupposed that man could be radically transformed. Rolland rejected Freud's determinism as pessimistic and re ductive, and he believed that man was neither good nor evil, sick nor healthy, but rather capable of achieving a symphonic balance of his mental and organic processes. To fulfill this equilibrium and to maintain it was man's task. Rolland was far more preoccupied with character building and the release of man's latent ethical capacities than was Freud.

In opposition to Freud's dualism, Rolland contested the inevitable antagonisms between material reality and the " oceanic " reality, the pleasure principle and reality principle, induction and deduction, the life and death instincts. To be whole for him meant attaining a psychological balance; it did not mean becoming ego-syntonic. The ego was part of the balance, but had to coexist with, not ward off or replace, the unconscious and the superego. What Rolland expected from Freud, but did not receive, was an empircal psychoanalytic exploration of the various dimensions of the " oceanic " sensation.89 Influenced by the contributions of Bergson, Le Roy, and James, Rolland de fended religious sensation as a practicing mystic. Yet he also assumed that religion could be anti-institutional, non-deistic, and even actively subversive of established attitudes and norms. Mysticism for Rolland was not a pathological state. His concept of religion did not correspond to either of Freud's two prototypes: the Catholic Church and the Jewish religion. Although he was unclear about the ultimate truth and signifi cance of the " oceanic," he was certain that the sensation could be felt without imparing the exercise of one's critical faculties. Rolland's belief in the "oceanic" was non-authoritarian: it was a faith built on insights which grew out of experience, and it was historically verifiable.80 Just as he opposed Freud's overvaluation of reason, Rolland opposed the methodological foundations and some of the major conclusions of Freudian theory. In the same manner that he had challenged the orthodox theory and practice of Marxism Leninism in the 1920's for its prescriptive laws and rigidity,91 88 For a contemporary comparison of the similarities between psycho analysis and mysticism, consult Herbert Fingarette, " The Ego and Mystic Selflessness," in Identity and Anxiety: Survival of the Person in Mass Society, ed., Maurice R.

He thought that much of Freudian terminology was emotionally charged, and that Freudian concepts were often connotative as well as denotative. As a contemporary critic who was not a member of the inter national psychoanalytic movement, Rolland recognized a religious component in the institutionalization of Freudian psychoanalysis. Perhaps because of his own Catholic child hood, he saw Freud's discoveries developing into a new church which included masters and disciples, dogma, con fessions and secrets, strict requirements for membership, and excommunications of dissident members. On one level, Rolland's reaction to Freudianism reflected the eclectic, heretical, and non-analytic aspects of his own intelligence. On another level, it mirrored the slowness and difficulties with which Freud's ideas were being accepted in France, even by someone who was acquainted with seminal texts as early as 1909.82 One cannot explain Rolland's cavalier dismissal of the oedipal configuration and of infantile sexu ality as merely a residue of the nineteenth century's roman ticization of children and the family. It is quite possible that Rolland was disturbed personally by Freudian theory. His resistance to some of the revolutionary implications of psycho analysis paralleled Freud's block to mysticism and music. It is difficult to ascertain how well Freud understood Rolland the man or his ideas. The converse is equally difficult to judge. More likely than not, there was partial compre hension on both sides. Rolland liked and respected Freud as a person. What he found compelling about Freud was his piercing intelligence, his stoicism, his tireless activity, his vigorous allegiance to science and, as shown by their letters, his candor about the nearness of death. Freud had been defensive, intolerant, and disputatious with Rolland; yet he had also revealed his vulnerability, and warmth, and an intense affection for his French friend. Because he could not dis 92Edith Hesnard-Fêlix, '"Les débuts de la psychanalyse en France," Europe, N° 539, March, 1974, pp. 69-87; Colette Cornubert, Freud et Romain Rolland.

It is this ambivalence, the oscillation between attraction and aversion, that creates the mysterious and dynamic element in their relationship and debates. # # # # # After 1930 the impact of the world depression and the fearful spreading of international fascism forced Rolland into an agonizing reassessment of his positions vis-à-vis contem porary affairs. As he became more engaged in social and political struggles in Europe, his commitments to Hindu mysticism and Gandhian non-violence waned. In the spring and summer of 1932, Rolland collaborated with the Commun ist intellectual, Henri Barbusse, to create a united front movement on the Left. What was to be known as the Amster dam-Pleyel Movement was inaugurated at a large international congress in August, 1932. To publicize the congress, Barbusse appealed to the European medical profession both to attend and support the Amsterdam meeting. Ernest Jones reports that Freud signed the appeal.83 Thus, Rolland's political activity indirectly touched his relationship to Freud. From 1933 to 1939, Rolland emerged as one of the sym bolic heads of the international anti-fascist movement. Within the framework of anti-fascist resistance, he critically endorsed Popular Front governments, and he was particularly enthusias tic about the Republican campaign in Spain. Fascism jolted him out of his immersion in myticism and religious questions.

When asked by Victor Wittkowski, a German writer, to help celebrate Rolland's seventieth birthday, Freud replied that he would not be able to contribute a new piece of writing for his " revered Friend Romain Rolland " because his creative energies were exhausted. He alluded to Part I of the then unpublished Moses and Monotheism which he thought might " have been of special interest to R. R., but it suffered from one defect which prevented it from being published since my ability to produce has dried up? " Nonetheless, Freud was irritated by Wittkowskis qualifi cation that political topics be excluded from all birthday contributions. In the highly politicized ambience of Europe, and especially in the light of Rolland's public stances, such a request was debilitating: If there is something that makes this refusal easier for me, it is that " all references to politics " have to be excluded. Under this paralyzing restriction—not being allowed to follow my urge to praise his courage of conviction, his love of truth, and his tolerance—I couldn't do anything, even if I were in my prime. Instead of offering a contribution, Freud would personalize his birthday greeting to Rolland: " On January 29 I shall tell him in a few lines that I am thinking of him with affection." 95 Wittkowski fared no better with Rolland than he had with Freud in this period. Rolland was irked by Wittkowskis insensitivity to his anti-fascist commitments. The German writer erred in trying to compartmentalize Rolland's multi faceted existence, and in depoliticizing his social and intellectual activities: I do not... separate my artistic work from my social activity...

Because of the grace and lucidity of Freud's style, she believed he would have a better chance for the literary award than the Nobel Prize for Medicine. Rolland was delighted to submit Freud's name to the Swedish Academy; however, his expectations for success were low primarily because the contents of Freud's writings did not free people from fear and anxiety. Freud probed too deeply; his conclusions were unsettling. Furthermore, many great writers had been ignored by this celebrated world organization; You know my affectionate admiration for S. Freud. It would be a pleasure and an honor for me to nominate him to the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize of Literature. But I greatly fear that the proposal has little chance.

Taken at face value, Freud's opening paragraph was eulogistic: ... I have made long efforts to find something that might in any way be worthy of you and might give expression to my admiration for your love of truth, for your courage in your beliefs, and your affection and good will towards humanity; or again, something that might bear witness to my gratitude to you as a writer who has afforded me so many moments of exaltation and pleasure.*8 What Freud gave, however, was not a eulogy, but the "gift of an impoverished creature." A close analysis of the text should provide a significant clue to the recurring tension in Freud's attitude toward Rolland—the psychical source of Freud's ambivalent feelings for his " revered friend." The paper appeared to have nothing whatsoever to do with Rolland, nor was it clear why the French writer might be interested in its subject matter. In the paper, Freud recounted the details of an incident which had occurred in late August, 1904. While on vacation in Trieste, Freud and his younger brother Alexander changed their plans to visit Athens. Although the idea of visiting Greece left them both " discontented," they travelled there for some inexplicable reason. Once in Athens, Freud experienced a strange feeling of disbelief; his thoughts were expressed in the exclamation: " So all this really does exist, just as we learnt as school! "100 Freud focused the remainder of the paper on an analytical evaluation of this thought, including an explanation of his brother's astonishment at his expression of disbelief, an eluci dation of the concept of " derealization," and an interpretative solution to the riddle of the incident—why it recurred in his memory. To interpret the underlying causes of his memory dis #» Sigmund Freud, " A Disturbance of Memory on the Acropolis: An Open Letter to Romain Rolland on the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday," (1936), Standard Editions, XXII, pp. 239-248. loo ibid., p. 241.</page><page sequence="50">50 David James Fisher turbance and the accompanying distortion of history, Freud argued that his incredulity at seeing the Acropolis arose from a childhood doubt that he would ever see Athens; he had not doubted the existence of Athens itself. His scepticism about his ability to " travel so far " was related to his life long love of travelling, which in turn derived from a wish to escape certain burdens of his youth and family life, The disturbing quality about going " such a long way " was that it involved surpassing his father, both in terms of the grandeur of the wish and in terms of the prohibition against fulfilling the impulse. The guilt Freud felt on his arrival at the Acropolis, like the depression experienced at Trieste, was the unconscious guilt felt by a son about his superiority over his father. Thus, an ostensibly pleasurable moment had involved Freud's implied father criticism for having accomplished something beyond the realm of his father's capacities; this led to uneasiness on Freud's part. And so Freud concluded: " Thus what interfered with our enjoyment of the journey to Athens was a feeling of filial piety."101 Though Freud's self-analysis of the recurring nature of this incident is plausible, other explanations are possible. Scholars have viewed Freud's Letter to Rolland as a " small masterpiece," a " literary gem," a " work of art," and as proof of Freud's " great admiration for him [Rolland]."102 Slochower accounts for the unanalyzed voyeuristic aspects of the paper and for Freud's sensation of having once seen loi Ibid., pp. 247-248. i"2 See respectively, Marthe Robert, D'Oedipe A Moke.

Freud's memory was disturbed, Slochower speculates, because he associated the Acropolis with a menacing image of his mother. The memory disturbance arose because of the conflict between seeing the symbolic image of the mother's genitalia and Freud's fear of doing so; this conflict explains Freud's guilt and his desire to conceal the episode. Slochower traces the classic fear of castration in Freud to a repressed memory of having seen his mother nude as a four year old child. Historically, the episode might have been triggered by Freud's uneasiness about his " oedipal relationship " to Wilhelm Fliess; the friendship with Fliess had taken a bad turn in 1904, Fliess claiming that Freud had plagiarized his discovery of bisex uality.103 Kanzer approaches the paper as a " self-analytic session." He uncovers three instances of Freud's ambivalence and/or hostility toward Rolland: first, the paper is not celebratory in content, the giver ungraciously admitting his " difficulties " in writing the Open Letter; second, Freud's insistence on his own loss of power implies that Rolland's creative energies will likewise diminish as he ages; third, Freud's veiled comparison with Rolland's mode of serving humanity, the oblique reference to the consolations of religion and art as opposed to the demystifying insights of science.104 Furthermore, Kanzer observes that Freud reverses his identity with Rolland on several occasions within the body of the paper. As Freud becomes the patient in the self-analytic session, the French writer becomes the analyst, hence Fliess' successor. With Rolland addressed, but silent, Freud replaces him as a writer. Because of the "Transference " phenomena in Freud's chain of associations, Rolland's role in the paper gives way to the sibling substitute, Alexander Freud. And finally, while fantasizing himself in Napoleon's place at the moment of coronation at Notre Dame in Paris, Freud usurps both Rolland's religious faith and nationality.105 103 " Freud's Déjà Vu on the Acropolis: A symbolic Relic of ' Mater Nuda,' " pp. 92, 99, 101. io* " Sigmund and Alexander Freud on the Acropolis," pp. 324, 325, 342. los ibid., pp. 325, 326, 343.</page><page sequence="52">52 David James Fisher Kanzer concludes that Freud's rigorous and imaginative self-analysis not only eliminates Freud's rival father and brother, but also by inference eliminates the rival Rolland; Freud's analysis has allayed his guilt without having eradicated the unhappiness of an old man with bitter memories. Yet for Kanzer, Freud's confrontation with old age is ultimately " realistic," that is, insightful without being either neurotic or consolatory, his self-analysis having led to the "harmonious resolution of the conflicting force." 109 In contrast to the definitiveness of this assessment, I see the paper more problematically; I hold that Freud's analysis has not resolved the various ambiguities in the paper. This is particularly apparent with regard to its conclusion when Freud reasserts his uneasiness, his anxiety about old age and declining power, and when he pleads for restraint and patience from Rolland. The following line of argument is suggested. The paper has a contrapuntal structure which centers around Freud's projection of extreme strength and weakness onto himself. It is written by a man who had " seen better days," yet by the same man whose scientific discoveries could be applied " by a bold extension, to the human race as a whole." In the same paragraph in which he discusses his relative dissatisfaction and powerlessness as an adolescent, he speaks of his zest for travell0T in epic terms: . .one feels oneself like a hero who has performed deeds of improbable greatness." Freud evokes another grandiose image of himself in comparing a make believe conversation he might have had with Alexander as a child to a remark allegedly made by Napoleon to his brother at the moment of the Corsican's "coronation as Emperor." Finally, there is Freud's sense of a loss of productive powers, his desire to create something worthy of Rolland, expressed at the beginning of the paper, and a concluding—almost pathetic plea for Rolland's " forbearance " because of age and an 10«Ibid., 337, 339, 343. 107 With unrelenting Freudian logic, Kanzer interprets Freud's ambition to visit the Acropolis as the fulfillment o£ a powerful oedipal desire: . .the experience of the journey as worthy of a hero's reward—an incestuous reunion with the mother in this incomparable setting." Ibid., p. 334.</page><page sequence="53">Sigmund Freud and Romain Rolland 53 inability to travel. Moreover, the idea of Freud's humility and impotence was offset by the reality of his ability to pose brilliant theoretical solutions to problems, in this instance, to explicate the meaning of the memory disturbance. Alongside of his own personal hesitations, Freud's atti tudes toward Alexander had been marred by " interference " at the time of the incident. They both had felt gloomy about the prospect of going to Greece while in Trieste. However, once they had reached the Acropolis, and after Freud had experienced his sensation of amazement, he did not ask his brother how he felt: " A certain amount of reserve surrounded the whole episode."108 The specific " interference " between them, Freud asserted, had been his brother's astonishment at his expression of disbelief. " What he had been expecting was rather some expression of delight or admiration." Furthermore, it is explicitly stated in the paper, as well as repeated in a letter to Arnold Zweig during the same month,109 that Freud associated Rolland with his brother; they were the same age: " My brother is ten years younger than I am, so he is the same age as you—a coincidence which has only occurred to me." 110 What associates Rolland and Alexander further was the ex pectation on both their parts that they would receive expressions of pleasure from Freud on two happy occasions; neither Rolland on his seventieth birthday nor Alexander on first seeing the Acropolis were presented with the anticipated response. When Freud makes the transition from the descrip tive to the analytical section of the paper, he switches his narrative from the first person singular to the first person plural. The logical implication is that Alexander shared Freud's guilt toward his father. What Freud is doing here is projecting unconsciously his own father criticism on to his brother. Most crucially, Freud's associations in the paper lead him from an analysis of the brothers' impressions to the idea of joint guilt with reference to their father. In the process, he 108"A Disturbance of Memory on the Acropolis," p. 243. 108 Letter, Freud to Arnold Zweig, Jan. 20, 1936, in Sigmund Freud-Arnold Zweig Briefwechsel (Frankfurt Am Main, 1968), Ernst L. Freud, ed. p. 130. no "A Disturbance of Memory on the Acropolis," p. 240.</page><page sequence="54">54 David James Fisher draws an unflattering characterization of his long deceased father: " Our father had been in business, he had no secondary education, and Athens could not have meant much to him." 111 Yet Freud's explanation of his memory disturbance, that his sentiments of filial piety arose from reverence for and faith fulness to his parents, particularly his father, is incomplete. One could argue that the unanalyzed incongruities in the paper, in addition to Freud's personal fluctuations, derive from basic conflicts in Freud's psyche. Thus, the memory distur bance, the depression, the emergence of interference and in credulity between Freud and his brother give rise to unavowed but disturbed feelings from Freud toward Rolland. Freud's interference with Alexander spills over to Rolland. Further more, the unconscious discrepancy between Freud's feelings of heroism and powerlessness point to guilt as the key causal agency in the episode. Guilt explains why the incident was only partially ex plained in the paper. The guilt itself derived from Freud's ambivalent attitude toward his father. His internal conflict manifested itself through patricide as well as through superego identification (" filial piety ") with his father. The classical love-hate feeling, the impulse to outstrip his father which clashed with his awareness of the forbidden nature of that wish, converged to produce Freud's resistance and guilt, In Freudian terms, Freud's anxiety over his desire to kill his father, matched by his longing for his father's love and protection, provide the censoring agency and dynamics for this specific episode. Metapsychologically, Freud's unresolved oedipal feelings for his father became the motor force in the inevitable tension caused by Freud's urge to love (the instinct of Eros) and to hate (the instinct of destruction). Freud connected age with loss of power (" I am ten years older than you and my powers of production are at an end "). His neurosis about his age went hand in hand with his paternalistic feelings toward the younger Rolland, The Freud Rolland relationship, in Freud's mind, re-enacted the father son pattern in terms of an elder brother's feelings for a "1 Ibid., p. 247.</page><page sequence="55">Sigmund Freud and Romain Rolland 55 cherished younger sibling. In the paper, Freud had compared two varieties of disbelief, the sensations of derealization and of " too good to be true."112 Freud's sensation of incredulity in Athens in 1904 was not unlike one which he described in a 1926 leter to Rolland: there, he implied Rolland's friendship surpassed his expectations and fulfilled a specific ambition.118 Freud's guilt about his father was exacerbated by having pre sented Rolland with a birthday present with such emotionally charged contents. We know that Freud disliked " exaggerated " expressions of sympathy, especially for celebrations like birth days.114 In his revolt against this " convention," he offered a gift which not only recorded his own divided psyche, but which also questioned whether he " deserved " Rolland's friendship— a man who " knew how to give presents." If we assume that Freud's ambivalence toward his father was displaced on to Rolland, it is probable that Freud's laudatory remarks, one might say his effusive flattery of Rolland in the first paragraph of the open letter, were in tended to compensate Rolland. Freud disguised his dual feelings for Rolland by exaggerating the positive nature of his friendship; perhaps he also wished to make amends to the French writer for the wounding psychological truths about himself, and the feelings about his father, expressed in the main body of the paper. Due to their prior, unresolved debate on the " oceanic " sensation, and because Freud's feelings of ambivalence had surfaced in his May, 1931 letter, Freud's memory of Rolland involved mixed emotions. It is probable that Freud harbored a grievance against Rolland, and that no details of the " oceanic " incident were forgotten. The Acropolis episode reawakened his feelings of attraction for and separation from Rolland, the unbridgeable differences between the great oceanic friend and the terrestrial animal. Having felt unworthy because of criminal feelings for his 112 Ibid., pp. 242-243. «3 Letter, Freud to Rolland, May 13, 1926, Freud Letters, p. 371; Freud said: " It seems to me a surprising accident that apart from my doctrines my person should attract any attention at all.

In short, Freud had hit upon a deep truth when he made the confession: " the person who gave expression to the remark was divided, far more sharply than was usually noticeable..115 Without entirely realizing it himself, Freud's chronic ambiv alence for his father was extended to his feelings toward Rolland. It is likely that Rolland was informed about but did not read Freud's analysis of the memory disturbance. After thanking Freud for his birthday telegram, he spoke of his feelings of respect and affection for the Viennese physician. In the letter which would be the last direct communication from Rolland to Freud, the French writer seemed unaware of Freud's ambivalent feelings for him. With controlled emotion, he mentioned both the birth of their friendship, his eternal gratitude to Zweig for having introduced them, and his sense of the mutuality of their relationship. " You know what profound respect I have for the man whose fearless glance has penetrated to the bottom of the internal abyss. I have admired him for a long time. I am happy and proud of his sympathy." 116 ***** Zweig continued as intermediary between Freud and Rolland in Freud's last years. On February 17, 1936, he requested Rolland's signature for an international committee honoring Freud's eightieth birthday.1" Freud thanked Rolland for participating in the birthday celebration in a two part note. The printed part read: " I thank you cordially for the part you played in the celebration of my eightieth birthday. Yours Freud."

He left Vienna with his family for London on June 4, 1938. Zweig mentioned his " joyful " reunion with Freud in England in a letter dated June 21, 1938. Although the fascists had stripped him of his material resour ces and tried to destroy his books, Freud's mind remained " independent and combative." Because of his ill health, Zweig again requested Rolland's support in obtaining a Nobel Prize for Freud.122 «8 Letter, Freud to Rolland, May, 1936, A. R. R.

Hitler's entrance into Vienna and the harsh treatment of Freud by the fascist van quishers stimulated Rolland to declaim angrily about those " bestially brutalized " men who suffered under the fascist yoke: The world has lost its sense of honor . , . The energetic intervention of the Ambassador of the United States was necessary to save old Professor Freud, octogenarian and sick, from insults and death, and the works of his whole life . . . When one evoked the ruins of the ancient world under the rush of the Barbarians, one would have be lieved that an indestructible dike had been constructed around civilization. But, all the same, the barbarians are amid civilization . . ,123 Never blind to heroic behavior, Rolland commented on Freud's traumatic, poignant last journey in a letter written to Zweig in London. "Send Freud greetings on my behalf. Present him with my affectionate respect. I have never doubted his bravery for an instant. His entire life has been the example of it." 124 That Rolland was fond of Freud and recognized the value of his theoretical contribution can be documented by a letter he wrote to Alfred O. Mendel during this period. Mendel, the American editor of Pyramid books, was compiling a series of introductory essays on the world's great thinkers. Having re appraised his earlier mixed feelings for her, Rolland suggested that Marie Bonaparte be given the commission to write on Freud in the collection: " Besides, she is Freud's best student and his Antigone on the earth of exile." Notwithstanding other " remarkable " personalities in the Freudian school, Rolland supported the choice of Princess Bonaparte. To associate their names together, he added, would be a " mag nificent demonstration "—a tribute to Freud's powerful in fluence in all realms of intellectual life.125 123 Romain Rolland, Journal intime, Jan., 1938-Jan. 1939, p. 29, A.

In a letter to Monod-Herzen, the man whose letter had first begun the Freud-Rolland relationship, he expressed his "revulsion " at the current wave of psychoanalytic explana tions by scientists, psychologists, and historians, including some of his own friends. Still resisting some of the universal postulates of the psychoanalytic movement, Rolland confessed that he " never had trouble in harmonizing within himself the father and the mother." The central problem with the con temporary " morbid, maniacal utilization " of Freudian con structs was the reductionism which accompanied it: " I be lieve life to be more rich and more complex. The Freudian hypothesis seems to me to falsify it, in simplifying life to the extreme—and I add not in the most natural and healthy sense.12® Rolland recorded somberly the news of Freud's death on September 22, 1939 in his private Journal: " Death in London of Dr. Sigmund Freud, who escaped from the Nazis of Austria thanks to aid from America. He was 83 years old." 12T With Freud's death and with Europe on the eve of a second world war, some of the vast issues which the two had discussed and disagreed over no longer seemed so vitally im portant. Praise and blame, ambivalence and resistance, analy sis and synthesis, irony and affection, all receded into the background as Europe's " discontented " civilization appeared to be giving way to barbarism. It was in the mood of fellowship and of sensitivity to the suffering of others that Rollond wrote a letter of bereavement to Zweig dated September 27, 1939.
