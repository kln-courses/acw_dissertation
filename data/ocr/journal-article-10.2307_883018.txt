(Published for The College Art Association of America by the Pennsylvania State University Press, 1986). ISBN 0-271-00416-9. This concise monograph deserves a hearty welcome on several counts. It is the first comprehensive study to be published of an early medieval building in Iran. It adds a significant new monument to the small, select corpus of surviving early Muslim build- ings outside the Levant. By the same token it removes that monument from the corpus of Sasanian archi- tecture and thus frees that material from being viewed through a distorting lens. Finally, it is a model speci- men of art-historical method, with a slow winding up of tension, and patient forensic deduction, of a type which is more often to be found in detective novels than in works of architectural history. The ramifications of this study, then, extend far beyond the narrow context proposed for the building. The meticulous fieldwork techniques revealed on virtually every page of the book, and Dr Bier's scrupulous care to venture not an inch further than the evidence will allow, lend his conclusions formidable authority. It may safely be asserted, then, that the so-called 'Sasanian palace' of Sarvistan in the neighbourhood of Shiraz in southern Iran is a Zoroastrian fire temple erected in the Islamic period some time between c.750 and c.950. Indeed, it symbolises the last brief flaring up of Zoroastrian fervour before that faith entered its long dark night in Iran. Amidst the new material on Sarvistan - among which the revised axonometric view holds a place of honour - many nuggets of information on vaulting, masonry, mouldings and like topics of more general relevance lie embedded. No student of Iranian architecture, then, can afford to ignore this book. R.H The Ham House kitchen. By Caroline Davidson. 48 pp. + 4 col. pls. &amp; numerous b. &amp; w. ills. (Victoria and Albert Museum, 1986), ?3.95. ISBN 0-905209-93-1. The V&amp;A has gone to great lengths to recreate the seventeenth-century kitchen at Ham House fur- nishing it with utensils and wickerware copied from contemporary engravings; this booklet gives an over- view of the life of domestics, what foods were used and in what form. Small Georgian houses in England and Virginia: origins and development through the 1750s. By Daniel D. Reiff. 348 pp. + 8 col. pls. + 520 b. &amp; w. ills. (Associ- ated University Presses, 1986). ?45. ISBN 0-87413-0254-1. Georgian houses are enduringly appealing. Daniel Reiff pursues their origins and the reasons for their appeal in England and Virginia. He draws parallels between houses of both lands, investigates notable examples and explains their differences and simi- larities. He describes how and why, despite their common ancestry, the small hipped roof houses of eighteenth-century Virginia are 'American' rather than 'English'. The first half of the book traces the development of the classical house in England from the Prince's Lodging to the Restoration country house and beyond to the myriad of small brick houses built across the South East during the Georgian period. This was the type successfully exported across the Atlantic, and in the second part of the book Reiffdescribes its impact and assimilation in Virginia. Here, it is sur- prising to learn that two of the most significant Virginia houses, Jaquelin-Ambler House and the great Rosewell, survive only as ruins. There are good descriptions of individual houses and an interesting discussion of the part played by pattern books in Virginia. Reiff's conclusion that the Georgian houses of Virginia were not copies of English examples but parallel developments within the same vernacular tradition is based upon a consistent and scholarly appraisal of the facts. This is a book which covers a complex period of architectural history. But the first part dealing with England is unnecessarily long and where it does pro- vide new insights these have to be balanced against old mistakes. Clarendon House was actually H-shaped, and Kingston Hall and Kingston Lacey are one and the same. Reiffwrites of Virginia with a more assured authority, although British readers may be unfamiliar with some of his transatlantic terminology. Despite this, and a text peppered with irritating printing errors, the book offers much information. Illustrations are comprehensive, and exhaustive footnotes and useful appendices proclaim the author's enthusiasm for his subject. I.M. Pei once remarked 'Georgian architecture was the best style of the lot. What was its secret?' This book goes some way towards answering that question. N.W. s-C. Fragmentos (Revista de arte), Nos.8 &amp; 9: issue devoted to Vitruvian studies. Articles by Jose Luis Sierra Cortes, Delfin Rodriguez Ruiz, and others. 166 pp. incl. numerous b. &amp; w. ills. (Ministerio de Cultura, Madrid, November 1986). In this issue there are altogether nine articles, among which may be singled out those of Jose Luis Sierra on Diego de Sagredo, Delfin Rodriguez on the interpretation of the Doric order by Pedro Jose Marquez published at Rome in 1803, Fernando Checa on Vitruvian and other theoretical influences in the design of the Escorial, and Santiago Sebastian L6pez on the use of anthropomorphic supports in Spanish and Hispano-American architecture. The article by Delfin Rodriguez on Pedro Marquez (pp.20-47) is particularly useful because Marquez is still under-recognised. He was an exceptionally interesting Neo-classical theorist of whom Cicognara wrote (1821): 'This learned Mexican displays a copi- ous erudition in all his works which merits their being placed among the most useful and instructive on their subjects'. J.B. The New York Public Library, its architecture and decoration. By Henry Hope Reed. 288 pp. + 22 col. pls. + numerous b. &amp; w. ills. (W.W. Norton and Co. Ltd., 1986). PB ?13.95 ISBN 0-393-30336-5. HB ?28 ISBN 0-393-02317-6. Henry Hope Reed is the author of The Golden City (1959) an agonised cri de coeur against the totalitarian- ism of the Modern Movement in architecture. He founded Classical America and its eponymous journal; reprints and monographs have followed. He began to lead tours of the then unregarded New York Public Library in 1972. This is a guide book, shunning the exhaustive scholarship of the American PhD disser- tation or even the monograph by Herbert Small in the same series, The Library of Congress (1984). The Library (1902-11) was the outcome of competition (1897) in which John Merven Carrere (1858-1911) and Thomas Hastings (1860-1929) triumphed over even McKim, Mead and White. Both were Paris Beaux-Arts trained architects whose highly successful firm was later responsible for Devonshire House, Piccadilly, London (1924-26). The Library is a Roman Corinthian-Louis-Quatorze design, one of the first Beaux-Arts successes in New York. Carrere and Hastings are more literal, more rationalist than McKim, Mead and White, and here the 'dictatorship of the Plan' results (as at Garnier's Paris Opera) in the attic and pitched roofs of the axial staircase and reading room rearing above the fagades. There is also an extraordinary west elevation of bookstack floors expressed on the facade to Bryant Park. The structure is load bearing brick with foot-thick marble revetment. The Grand Sizcle richness is con- tinued in the interior metalwork and woodwork. A staggering $77 million restoration is in progress, re- turning many rooms to their original functions. Reed delights in the surfaces of all this richness and adds biographies of the craftsmen and artists concerned. The public library was certainly the secular, ecu- menical cathedral of what contemporaries called 'The American Renaissance', which included McKim, Mead and White's Boston Public Library (1887) and the Low Library, Columbia University, New York (1893). Here, unfortunately, Reed sidesteps the task of treating the Beaux-Arts seriously as an architectural programme, archly dismissing from his analysis 'Construction techniques . . . because they are as unimportant an aspect of the New York Public Library as they are for most great buildings in the world (p16)'. Except in the applied arts, our percep- tion of the library is tantalisingly unfulfilled: the competition drawings are weakly reproduced, and there are no sections or details, all of which surely sur- vive in the archives. The only specially commissioned drawings, the ugly floor plans, are unscaled. There is no bibliography or footnotes. As a Festschrift, this is a handsome tribute, but apologists for classicism such as Reed face a much harder task than this seductive afternoon tour guide implies. R.O0D. Trompe-l'aeil Painted Architecture. By Miriam Milman. 117 pp. + numerous col. pls. (Skira/Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1986), ?25. ISBN 0-297-78915-5. Games painters have played with architectural space from Pompeii to the 1980s, aiming at expans- iveness, economy, orjust fun. Excellent reproductions. Louis Sullivan. The Function of Ornament. Catalogue with essays by David Van Zanten, William Jordy, Wim de Wit, Rochelle Elstein and Robert Twombly. 224 pp. + 24 col. + 139 b. &amp; w. ills. (Norton &amp; Company, New York &amp; London, 1987). ISBN 0-393-02358-3. As one of the earliest and most significant designers ofskyscrapers, Sullivan is often remembered as prac- tising the art of ornamentation on a grand scale. In this catalogue of the retrospective exhibition seen in Chicago, and now in New York, Sullivan's small- scale buildings, banks and department stores, with their elaborate decorative schemes in terracotta, stained-glass and mosaic, receive equal prominence. The exhibition moves to Saint Louis in August and closes in October. 411</page></plain_text>
