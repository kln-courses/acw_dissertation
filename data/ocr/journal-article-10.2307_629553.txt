<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS 1 AFTER a hundred and thirty years of controversy, the interpretation of the Prometheus Bound is still the subject of debate. To the romantic poets of the revolutionary era, the Titan tortured by Zeus for his services to mankind appeared as a symbol of the human spirit in its struggle to throw off the chains which priests and kings had forged for it.2 But to the distinguished Hellenists who after the fall of Napoleon laid the foundations of the great century of German scholarship, no such naive and one-sided view of the Prometheus seemed tolerable. It was partly, perhaps, that the political atmosphere discouraged an interpretation adverse to authority; but the other writings of Aeschylus himself seemed to offer strong evidence against this view. Elsewhere in Aeschylus, they could argue, Zeus was treated with profound respect. In the Supplices, he is continually appealed to by the chorus of Danaids, who miss no opportunity to extol the supremacy of his power. Zeus' omnipotence is the burden of a celebrated section of the first chorus of the Agamemnon; although scholars have differed widely in the details of their interpretation of this passage, most are agreed that it expresses theological doctrines that are at once subtle and sublime, and many have discovered profound significance in its puzzling allusions to ' learning by suffering' and to a Xapls that comes to men from the gods. Chiefly upon evidence derived from these two plays, many scholars have credited their author with the invention of a peculiar personal religion, tending to exalt Zeus at the expense of the other members of the Olympic pantheon, and crediting him with the purpose of perfecting men in goodness through the discipline of suffering. Some have gone so far as to detect tendencies to monotheism in Aeschylus.3 A fair specimen of the usual kind of view is that of Nilsson,4 who begins by hesitating to pronounce Aeschylus a monotheist; Aeschylus, he warns us, is not a religious innovator preaching a new form of religion, but a profoundly pious poet;5 but later, he comes dangerously near to this view. The power of Zeus, he argues, is so much magnified that at one point he seems more a principle than a personal god.6 In dealing with the famous fragment of the Heliades (fr. 70): ZEsus CEaTT ail0p, ZEs's SE 'yi, ZEV's 8' o0'pavo6s, ZEvS TO T-r TrdVTra Xcort TCOV86' jTr~TEpov. Nilsson leaves open the possibility that the poet 'went yet further', and embraced a pantheistic view of nature.7 Twice he speaks of 'Aeschylus' Zeus-religion', and finally he remarks with some surprise that it had no influence on posterity.8 Here, then, is the problem which perplexed the contemporaries of Hermann and Welcker and which still perplexes us: how is the presentation of Zeus given in the Prometheus Vinctus to be recon- ciled with the picture of him found in the other plays of Aeschylus ? This disagreement is in large measure due to our ignorance regarding the trilogy of which the surviving Prometheus play formed part. Of the 11popTr0esS Auv6pvos we possess a number of frag- ments, and it is clear that the release of Prometheus by Heracles, predicted in the existing play, occurred in this work, as its name implies. Of the Vlpop~e8eS Hupqp6pos, on the other hand, we know scarcely anything. Welcker's opinion that it was the first play of the trilogy 9 has been generally given up since Westphal pointed out that the narrative of past events in the Prometheus Vinctus makes it improbable that another play had gone before.10 But the extreme rarity of quotations lends colour to the suspicion that VRpopCre0E's Hupq6pos may be simply another way of referring to the satyr-play 1 This paper was read to the Oxford branch of the Classical Association in November 1953.

Professor D. S. Robertson has suggested 11 that the author may have died without putting the finishing touches to the trilogy and that some of the odes may have been supplied by one of his sons, Euphorion and Euaion, or by his nephew, Philocles. Without new evidence this theory cannot be proved right or wrong; but the convenient explanation which it offers of the abnormalities of style and language 12 and the yet more striking abnormalities of metre 13 presented by the P. V. make it a possibility which must be taken seriously. In another place I hope to discuss in detail the limited evidence which bears on the reconstruction of the trilogy; here, I wish to concentrate upon the central problem of the conflict between Zeus and Prometheus. Some scholars have contended, against all appearances, that the sympathy of the audience is meant to lie, not with Prometheus, but with Zeus. Others have argued that the remaining play or plays of the trilogy must have shown a development in Zeus' character; from the savage tyrant of the P.V. must have emerged the beneficent monarch of the Supplices and Agamemnon. Others, un- willing to accept either view, have denied that the surviving Prometheus play can be by Aeschylus, a view to which the abnormalities referred to certainly lend some colour.14 The first of these three opinions was originated by Schoemann,15 was taken over by Wecklein,16 and is familiar to English readers from the school edition of Sikes and Willson (Macmillan, 1898), which after fifty years is still the most useful commentary to the play in our language. Prometheus, Schoemann argued, did mankind no real good; all he did was to invent science and technology, mixed blessings. Holders of this view describe the conflict in the language of Christian or Jewish theology; Prometheus has sinned and is receiving just punishment, and in the last play he will repent and acknowledge his transgression. Some of them even argue that the conduct of Zeus described in the P.V. was only part of a higher design for the destiny of mankind,17 a design oddly reflected in Zeus' intention, frustrated only by Prometheus, of exterminating them (see 1. 231-4). This opinion has gone out of fashion during the present century, and no wonder.18 Dissen 19 was the first to suggest that the trilogy showed an evolution in the character of Zeus, an evolution which by the beginning of the last play of the trilogy must have transformed the youth- ful tyrant of the Prometheus Vinctus into a beneficent ruler, who of his own free will releases his noble enemy. This is a view which during the last century remained comparatively unpopular, but which during the present one has become accepted by most scholars. It was adopted by Wilamowitz; 20 and among living scholars it is held by Nilsson (loc. cit.), Festugiere,21 and Professor E. R. Dodds (in an unpublished paper read last year to the Leeds branch of the Classical Association, which he has with the greatest kindness allowed me to make use of). Wilamowitz (Aischylos. Interpretationen, p. I5o) quoted in illustration of it the Semitic scholar Vischer's explanation of the savage cruelties perpetrated in the name of the Jehovah of the Old Testament: ' In those days the good God him- self was young '; and he drew attention to the constant stressing, in the P. V., of the youth of Zeus and the newness of his power. By way of parallel, the holders of this opinion point to the change of character they say is experienced by the Eumenides in the play named after them. Is the notion of a god thus changing in character one that Aeschylus can possibly have enter- tained? Schmid (op. cit., p. 89) flatly asserted that it was impossible; the Greek notion of divine growth, he contended, is expressed in Callimachus' address to Zeus: &amp;?A' ETi aTraSV6S Aov iE2ppdoocao TravTa -rhFeta (Hy. I, 57). And since Schmid wrote, two eminent authorities on Greek religion, Farnell and Karl Reinhardt,22 have expressed agreement. x" Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society, 1938, pp. 9-1o. 12 See especially J.

Reinhardt makes the important remark that the stress laid upon the youth of Zeus in the P. V. may well be explained by the desire to contrast the older gods, to whom Prometheus be- longed, with the younger generation of Zeus and his brothers and sisters. For a similar contrast, cf. Eum. 150, 731, 778-9, 808-9, 882-3.</page><page sequence="3">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS 57 Believers in the development theory have certainly failed to support it by any convincing parallel. That of the Eumenides was exploded by Farnell, who points out (loc. cit., p. 47) that they do not change in character. A handsome offer from Athene, backed by the threat of Zeus' thunder (Eum. 826-8), induces them to abandon their design of avenging upon Athens the acquittal of Orestes, and to take up their quarters on the Acropolis. They do not repent of their earlier persecu- tion of Orestes, any more than they hand over their duty of pursuing the slayers of their own kin to the court of the Areopagus or to the Athenian state, as so many scholars have implied they do. And without a parallel, the development theory is not easy to defend. The most ingenious argument for it known to me is that of Professor Dodds, who argues that its opponents have confused the character of the Aeschylean Zeus with that of the eternal and unchanging god whose first appearance in Greek thought is no earlier than Plato and Aristotle. The Zeus of the fifth-century poets, he points out, differed from this god in being within time. Zeus had not always been the monarch of the universe, but Ouranos and Kronos had gone before him; Zeus had been a child, and his birth- place could be visited.23 No one can deny that the Zeus of Aeschylus' age was within time; but one may question whether it follows from this that his character could develop. Professor Dodds draws attention to the constant stressing of the youth of Zeus, and argues that this may indicate that when Zeus was older he will have become wiser.24 But Reinhardt has pointed out (loc. cit., p. 68) that this can easily be explained by the poet's desire to contrast the older generation of gods, to which Prometheus belonged, with the younger generation of Zeus and his brothers; for a similar contrast between older and younger gods, see Eum. 16o, 731, 778-9, 808-9, 882-3. The advocates of the development theory fail to support it by adducing any certain example of such a change of character in any god. And I shall argue later (see p. 66) that, in view of what we are told about Prometheus' knowledge of the danger that threatens Zeus, the development theory is not necessary to the working out of the plot. I have given reasons for hesitating to accept either the view that Zeus throughout the trilogy must have been seen in a more sympathetic light than that in which the surviving play reveals him or the view that the later play or plays showed a development in Zeus' character. Schmid, who rejected both these opinions, felt himself obliged to deny the authenticity of the single surviving play; 25 the linguistic and metrical evidence which he adduced, while by no means lightly to be brushed aside, would not, I suspect, have led him to so extreme a step had not the content of the play conflicted with his whole conception of Aeschylus. He held that the presentation of Zeus in the other plays of Aeschylus was one so elevated, so advanced, and so profound that its author could not possibly have written the Prometheus Vinctus, with its. very different picture. No, this play must be by someone else; and Schmid invented a sophist of the last quarter of the fifth century, probably an Ionian and certainly a blasphemer and a degenerate, to serve as whipping boy. Now if the development theory is regarded with suspicion, as I think it must be, how can Schmid's view or one like it be ruled out ? Can this be done by questioning any of the assumptions common, so far, to all investigators of the problem? All alike have maintained the purity, nobility, and refinement of the theology of the other plays of Aeschylus, so utterly at variance with the theology of the Prometheus Vinctus. It may be worth while to re-examine the evidence on which this assumption rests. I will begin with the Supplices, which has more about Zeus than any other play of Aeschylus but the P. V., and which has supplied much of the evidence alleged in favour of an Aeschylean Zeus-religion. Apart from occasional invocations of Zeus as vNios (627, 672 cf. Ag. 61, 362, 748), orTip TrpiroS (26 cf. Eum. 759-60, fr. 55, 4) or &amp;XE?erliptos (8), the chorus of Danaids appeals to him in three capacities; as their ancestor through Epaphos, his son by lo, as Hikesios, the pro- tector of suppliants, and as the special defender of the rights of Dike, Justice. There are also a number of invocations which lay special stress on the supremacy of Zeus' power. The first two of these four aspects of Zeus do not here require investigation. Any other Olympian might have been the divine ancestor of the chorus; and any other Olympian might have had the protection of sup- pliants as a special charge. The two aspects that remain must be examined; I will take first the last-mentioned. The power of Zeus is celebrated above all in two well-known passages, one in the parodes (86-1o3) and the other at the end of the second stasimon (590-99). 23 See Wilamowitz, Der Glaube der Hellenen I, pp. I27-32. 24 Professor Dodds supports his argument by a reference to Moschion fr. 6 (Nauck2, pp. 813-I4). This fragment describes the early time when men lived like beasts without houses, crops, or tools: 1v 8' 6 Pv v6pos TarrrEav6, i Pia 8 ~C'vepovos Aut. At last Time, the mother and nurse of all things, educated them: ei-r' o'bv gpipvaCv -rv FTpopODeicos rrdpa Eir' o0iv &amp;v&amp;yKT )V E ETS paKp? rpiTfi aO-rrjv wrapaaoc' v -rjv Prmaiv 88&amp;6tKarov. and they tilled the soil, built cities, and buried their dead. Professor Dodds suggests that Moschion wrote with the Prome- theus-trilogy in mind; he thinks the first of the two passages I have quoted may allude to the replacement, at the end of the trilogy, of Bia by Dike as the rTpESpos of Zeus. Now in line 16 it is not certain that Adi is the right reading; both the MSS. of Stobaeus originally read vni, which has been corrected to Al in P. The correction may be right, but Canter's S(Kq has slightly more palaeographical probability. But even if Amt were unquestionably right, the inference regarding the Prome- theus-trilogy would not be certain. 25 Op. cit. With ludicrous over-confidence, he treats this con- jecture of his own, in his history of Greek literature, as an established fact: Schmid-Staihlin, op. cit., I ii 193, 281 f.</page><page sequence="4">58 HUGH LLOYD-JONES tEl0 E'T1 Al6S ECJ rCmavaCOCrAcS Albs IEpoS.t OjK E00flpaTos E-rTXn; ra'cvrqT Tol qA EyE'OE K&amp;1V OK6OTCA 1EC(?iV O'V TUX1 90 PIEp6OrrEao l ?c=oS1.

The opening of the first is probably corrupt, and has not been convincingly emended; 'would that the desire of Zeus may in all truth be of Zeus ' is very curious sense. The chorus continues: ' Is not it (he?) easy to track down? See, everywhere it (he?) blazes, even in the darkness, with a black fate for mortal peoples. And it falls safely and not on its back, any act that the nod of Zeus ordains shall be accomplished. For thick and bushy do the paths of his mind extend, inscrutable to the eye. And from their high towers of hope he hurls mortals to utter destruction, yet he arms no violence against them. Effortless are all things for the gods: seated he somehow accomplishes his purpose, come what may, from his sacred seat.' The passage from the second stasimon runs as follows: 590 Tiv' &amp;av ECov Ev5KKCOTEpotov KEKAOIO(V E'o.yco -S irr' PYOIS ; aiTos 6 rra-Trip Tv-roupyos aTo6XEip &amp;vt , yivoVus TrccAaOt6cppCv pycas -rEKTCA)v, -r Trrv PIXap, oVpios ZEs'S. 595 0 Tr' apXas 6' oTrivos Oo'3&amp;cv To IoElOV KPEIMooov COV KpaTJVEl. oTrivoS aVCoOEv IThEVOU v aEEl KaTCAO.

The Father himself is the King whose very touch begat us, the mighty architect of our race of old is he who can cure all ills, the kindly Zeus. And seated beneath no other's power, he that is greater rules over what is less. He does not pay reverence below while another sits above; his is the power to accom- plish a deed as easily as a word, any deed his counselling mind brings forth.' It is important to recognise that this exaltation of Zeus' power is not new. These passages recall the nod with which Zeus assures Thetis of his help at II. I 524-30 and Zeus' boasting that he could draw up gods and earth and sea upon a golden chain at II. VIII 18-27. Zeus in Homer may seem a less remote and dignified figure than Zeus in Aeschylus outside the P.V. But this may be simply because he is shown at closer range. In the Iliad just as much as in Aeschylus, Zeus effectively controls the action: A6bs 5' ATEAEiETo pouMi. This may apply to the Zeus of the P. V. also. The Aeschylean Zeus, like the Homeric, has power to accomplish any action, or almost any action, by his mere fiat; he is, in one sense, omnipotent, and is called so three times in Aeschylus (Sept. 255, Supp. 816, Eum. 918; cf. Supp. 1048-9, Eum. 650-1, P.V. 61). But at this point Professor Dodds's warning against confusion between the fifth-century Zeus and the later OE6S ac'CVIos of the philosophers must be born in mind, though the context is different from that in which it was originally delivered. Zeus' omnipotence is limited, and so is different from the kind of omnipotence that is familiar to modern thinking. Some of its limitations are ascribed to an unwillingness to transgress the decrees of fate; as in the Iliad Zeus regretfully decides not to save Sarpedon, so in the Agamemnon (1022-6) and the Eumenides (644-51) he is said to have forbidden others to raise men from the dead, and we infer that he would not do this himself. One limitation of his power does not seem voluntary; in the P. V., he cannot kill the immortal Prometheus (1053; cf 933). Moreover Zeus is</page><page sequence="5">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS 59 not safe against the remoter consequences of his own actions; just as Kronos begat a son more powerful than himself, so will Zeus also, unless Prometheus warns him first. The will of the later philosophic god is identical with the will of destiny; that of the Aeschylean Zeus is not. In the P.V. (518). we learn that Zeus cannot escape Fate; and the last words of the Eumenides imply a similar distinction between their powers. Just as Zeus is omnipotent, but not omnipotent in the modern sense, so is he eternal, but not eternal as we use the word. The rule of Zeus, says the chorus of the Supplices, will never end (574, 51' CaiCVOS KPiCOV da&amp;Trc-aTou); but unlike that of the Platonic god, it had a beginning. Another epithet of the philosophic god that has been misleadingly applied to Zeus is 'perfect'. At the opening of the second stasimon of the Supplices (524), Zeus is invoked as follows: avacX avaKTCOV, ptoaKapcAv IaKapT-rTEK Kaoi -rTE;ECOV TrEAET6-raT-rOV KpdaTO, 6PIEl ZEO. 'King of Kings, most blessed of the blessed ones, strength mightiest to accomplish of all that have this power.' Professor Fraenkel's note on Ag. 973 well brings out the sense of the epithet T7AloOS. The common rendering ' most perfect of the perfect ' is as inaccurate as it is vague, and carries with it a most misleading suggestion of metaphysical perfection. I come now to the conception of Zeus as the special champion of the rights of Dike. At Supp. 143 f., the chorus appeals to Dike as the daughter of Zeus; cf. Cho. 948 f., where her name is probably etymologised as A65b K6pa. Zeus holds the balance and dispenses injustice to the wicked and holi- ness to the law-abiding (403 f.); the power of Zeus is just (437); Zeus is implored to look with hostile eye, 'in accordance with justice ', upon the violence of the pursuers (811 f.). This con- nection also receives special stress in the Seven Against Thebes; there we are repeatedly told that Zeus and Dike are on the side of Eteocles and the defenders; this is implied at 443-6, 565-7, and 630, and is clearly stated at 662-71, where Eteocles calls Dike the maiden daughter of Zeus and affirms that Polyneices, from his earliest years, has had no part in her. There is more about the relation of Zeus and Dike in a fragment of great interest published in Volume XX of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (P. Oxy. 2256, fr. 9(A)), of which I reproduce the text with Mr. Lobel's supplements. The fragment has not been assigned to any particular play,26 but is probably from a satyr-play. The speaker of the g~5i'S with which the fragment begins is clearly Dike herself; she is explaining the manner in which she came by her historic privileges. [LKapCOV.

Robertson has suggested (CR 1953, pp. 79-80) that the person whose mischievous behaviour is de- scribed in the concluding lines is Ares, and that Dike is leading up to an account of his trial for the murder of Halirrhothius. Ares, however, is nowhere else credited with such a persecution of travellers as that described in lines 34 f.; and one recalls that this feature would suit Cycnus, not the son of Poseidon killed by Achilles, but the son of Ares killed by Heracles. This Cycnus used to harry pilgrims on the way to Delphi (Hes. Sc. 478-80, Eur. H.F. 389-94). Wecklein and Nauck credit Aeschylus with a play KCIKvos, but only tentatively, because of Ar. Ran. 963: K(iKVOov rTroiCOV Kca Mpvvovas KCOaCovopaXAapOK6WrOUV5. Professor Robertson has warned me that in this passage the association with Memnon suggests that the other Cycnus is meant (cf. Pindar 01. ii, 82 and Isth. v, 39). Still, the Hesiodic Cycnus is a familiar figure in literature and art (cf. Hes. Sc. passim; Pind. 01. x, 15; Eur. H.F., loc. cit.; Alc. 503; see Engelmann in Roscher's lexicon, p. 1690; he occurs ten times in Dr. Jacobsthal's mythological index to Sir John Beazley's Attic Red-Figure Vasepainters, the other Cycnus never). But it is hard to think of a supplement that will accord with this suggestion. For another suggestion about this fragment, see Ed.

OS In line 5, it seems probable that aT-r~j refers to the throne once occupied by Kronos, but now by Zeus, and that Zeus is here described as taking his seat upon it. Lines 6 and 7 seem to have said that Zeus gained his victory justly, because his father began the fight.27 From this time, the goddess continues, Zeus did her honour; the reason seems to be that Zeus, having been attacked first (Traecbv, 1. 9), took counter-measures against Kronos, and thus had Justice on his side. Dike now sits (1. I o) beside the throne of Zeus, and he sends her to those mortals to whom he is well disposed. If this is untrue, the goddess' hearers will know it. How, then, is she to be addressed? Dike is her name. And what is her -tvifl, her particular prerogative? For just men, she protracts their righteous existence; but the wanton or rebellious she chastises. How? By writing down their offences in the books of Zeus, so that when the day of reckoning comes, they will be brought to judgment. The conception of justice suggested by this passage is not, it must be conceded, a very advanced one. In particular, the account of how Dike acquired her privileges seems oddly primitive. Zeus' reason for bestowing them is strangely personal for the sublime Zeus of Aeschylus; it would hardly be surprising if a god who came to grant Dike her privileges in such an accidental way should be unwilling to allow his own practice in private matters to be regulated strictly by her laws. And the sort of justice implied by this passage, and also by those from the Supplices and the Septem which I have quoted, seems to be a rough, eye-for-an-eye justice, best expressed in the words of that fragment from an unknown epic which was the favourite quotation of the emperor Claudius: Si KS Tra001 T~ T EpE?E, iKTr~ K' lIEla yEvoiTO 28 It may, of course, be argued that the mythology of a single play, and that very probably a satyr-play, is no reliable guide to the general conception of Zeus and Dike entertained by Aeschylus. I can only answer that I have found in Aeschylus nothing that is inconsistent with this notion, but much that is consistent with it; and I shall presently try to support this opinion by an examination of the Oresteia. But first I must point out the close correspondence of the fragment with the Works and Days of Hesiod, a writer whose great importance for the understanding of Aeschylus has lately been given increased and necessary recognition. Zeus, says Hesiod (252 ff.), sends to earth thirty thousand watchers to observe the doings of men. The maiden Dike is Zeus' daughter, honoured by the Olympian gods, and when any man does her violence, she takes her seat by Zeus and pro- claims the injustice of men, that he may punish them.

To men, on the other hand, Zeus has given Dike, which is far the best of all things; for to the man who recognises what is just and is willing to speak it out, Zeus gives prosperity; but as for the man who bears false witness upon oath and does outrage against Dike, his race after him becomes feeble.

With this doctrine the Oxyrhynchus fragment, and also the Supplices and the Septem, is in no way inconsistent. It remains to enquire whether the Oresteia provides any evidence for an exalted and sophisticated conception of Zeus. The chorus of the Agamemnon in its opening anapaests declares that it is Zeus, Zeus Xenios, who has sent the Atreidae against Troy; the purpose of Zeus is being worked out, and no attempt to appease him can succeed (60o f.). Of this we are reminded at the beginning of the first choral ode. The portent of the eagles comes from Zeus, and it carries with it Zeus' promise that the expedition shall achieve its purpose. But the portent ' though favourable, is fraught with blame ': TOoJrTC 8V' a(iTEl I'(p3oXoa Kp:vai SEla% iv, K Tiarrpoa(a 8 qdc papora (I44-5) The subject of the sentence is Artemis; and whom is Artemis asking to fulfil the portent ? The common use of KpaiVEIV to describe Zeus' making valid of his ordinances, as well as the general sense of the passage, suggests that it is Zeus. To supply Aifa as the subject of KpaiVEIV is certainly not easy. But in this context the likelihood of a reference to Zeus is considerable; and there is a passage of the Prometheus which seems to me to supply a parallel. At PV. 99-too Prometheus says: pE0 v 0E, TO TapoV To T -WETEPX6OPEVOV irrfa o-TEavdXco, rT VolrOTrE I6xecov XpTi TEpIJara T-rv6' F'rliTEiOai. Most editors think that T-rpara is the subject of the oratio obliqua clause here; and they take ETriTEhca as a rare instance of the active of this verb being used, as the passive so often is, of the rising of stars or planets or of things that are compared to stars or planets. So they arrive at the translation ' when is an end of my labours fated to arise '. Another way of explaining this passage would be to take rrunrEihai in its common sense of ' to command' and to supply Aic from the preceding sentence as its subject: then one would render it ' when is he destined to ordain the end of these labours ? ' Why then is iroi used where we should expect Tr-re ? .roi occurs with a verb mean- ing 'to end' to denote the point in time at which something is to end at Pers. 735 etc.; see Index Aeschyleus s.v. TroT II; and here Trpparc .. T-rn-rEiTha has the force of such a verb. This seems to me open to rather less objection than the usual way of dealing with the problem. The chorus, then, is faced with a dilemma; Zeus has sent the Atreidae against the Trojans, but Zeus will concede to Artemis her demand for vengeance against the tearers of the hare. True, Zeus' responsibility is most obscurely indicated; but it may fairly be argued that the reluctance of both Kalchas and the chorus to admit it openly supplies a good reason why it should be darkly suggested instead of clearly stated. In his warning against the dangers that will follow, Kalchas does not only prophesy the sacrifice of Iphigenia; he hints at still more grievous consequences of that sacrifice: lIiIVEi yap op3epX 'TraiVOpTOS oiKOV61OS 8odaf &amp;Vx&amp;lcAV fivtiS ~TEKVOTroivoS (154-5) The chorus' dilemma explains something which I have not seen otherwise accounted for: it explains why the chorus chooses this point to break off its narrative of the events at Aulis to appeal to Zeus. Zeus only has the power to stave off the danger of which the prophet has given warning. This is the context in which is set the famous passage which has so often been appealed to, seldom with any reminder of the nature of that context, by the believers in a ' Zeus-religion '. 'Whoever Zeus is, if this name is acceptable to him, by this do I address him.' This invocation is indeed singular; but its singularity has long since been explained in terms of a type of ritual</page><page sequence="8">62 HUGH LLOYD-JONES address not uncommon in ancient religion. In order to invoke a god successfully, you must address him by the right name; accordingly, you either enumerate a whole string of titles or, to save time and to ensure not leaving out the title which the god really does approve, you adopt the form we find here. Many scholars have acknowledged this, but have none the less argued that Aeschylus here makes use of a relic of primitive religion in order to serve advanced convictions of his own.29 If any convincing evidence of an advanced or spiritual conception of Zeus can be adduced from Aeschylus, this possibility will receive confirmation; at this stage of the investigation, we can only observe that, taken by itself, the passage is wholly explicable as an echo of a primitive manner of invoking gods. ' Measuring all things against him, I can compare to him none but Zeus, if I am in truth to cast from my reflecting mind the vain burden.' What is ' the vain burden'? pa-ros and its cognates are often used of the ' vain' or' frivolous' conduct of those who deny or defy the power of Zeus; and Professor Fraenkel (op. cit., pp. 102-3) takes ' the vain burden ' to mean the burden borne by those who think such thoughts. I cannot understand how this meaning can have been clear to the audience. The ' vain burden ' is presumably a burden which the chorus is seeking to cast from its own mind. Perhaps this is simply the burden of worry about the fortunes of the house of Atreus. Perhaps it is the burden of trying to think of someone, other than Zeus, with whom Zeus can be compared, a burden which the chorus do, at this minute, jettison. Whatever it is, I doubt if this expression has any religious implication. What follows shows little trace of an advanced conception; rather it recalls the crudest myths of Hesiodic cosmogony. Ouranos ruled first till Kronos overthrew him; then Kronos ruled till he, in turn, was overthrown by Zeus; sing to Zeus a hymn of victory and you will have managed to attain good sense. ' Good sense ' in this connection means the recognition of the feebleness of men in comparison with the gods; in the next stanza it is echoed by qppovEiv at 1. 176 and CoqppovEiv at 1. 181 (see Fraenkel on 1. 176 (p. 105)). What is the meaning of the first three lines of the next stanza, from which many scholars have extracted quasi-Tolstoyan theories of' redemption through suffering'? Professor Fraenkel translates it: 'it is Zeus who has put men on the way to wisdom by establishing as a valid law " By suffering they shall win understanding ".' The use here of a familiar proverbial expression cannot be dissociated from a famous passage of the Works and Days, in which Hesiod solemnly warns his deplorable brother to choose Dike in preference to Hybris. In the end, he assures him, Dike will be triumphant: ~i Krl 8" "lTrEp OI@pPoS T XEl S EhoS EEX000a. r'aOc'Ov E~ TrE VilTriO 'yVCO. (218-19) Here we have the earliest application to the dealings of the gods with men of a proverbial expression which appears earlier in the Homeric phrase eEX06V S&amp; E E VilTOS Eyvco (P32, YI98). How far has Aeschylus moralised or theologised this piece of popular wisdom? Many have used it to contend that he thought sufferings were sent by the gods to refine or purify the character of mortals. But the actual victims of this law in the Oresteia, Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus, scarcely bear out this contention. They are not purified or ennobled; they are simply killed; and the after life to which they are consigned is not one that offers scope for moral evolution. Other people, it may be argued, will learn from their example. But it is not easy to see what those people will learn, if not the uselessness of defying Zeus' law; and this the victims themselves, in their last moments, may be said to learn also. Now though this doctrine is in a sense ethical, it cannot be called advanced ethics. The stanza continues: ' And before the heart there drips, instead of sleep, pain that reminds of injury; and even to the unwilling discretion comes.' This clearly reinforces, in other words, what has been said immediately before. What comes next is very difficult. To brush aside the easy correction piatos as one dictated by subjective considerations is, I think, a mistake. The strongest argument for this change is a grammatical one; a perfect, as Professor Fraenkel has shown in his note on 407, describes a state and not an action, and therefore cannot be modified by an adverb of the sort that normally describes an action, such as 3plaicos. Not that this argument in favour of Pi(Ios is decisive, piivcov, unlike PIPan&lt;Ev at 407, is a participle; and it is arguable that since the words rACa oa~yv6v i~vcov are in effect equivalent to &amp;px6vrcov they can be modified by just such an adverb as APX6vTrov might be.30 In any case, the difference to the sense is not a great one. Keep p~aicos and you get the sense, 'And it is, I think, a kindness coming from the gods who by violence sit on their dread bench.' Read P3clatos and you get: 'And it is, I think, a kindness done by violence that comes from the gods who sit on their dread bench.' Neither version leaves any excuse for sentimentalising this Xdpts, which is clearly of the sort that would normally be described 29 See Fraenkel ad loc. (Agamemnon II, p. ioo). 30 ' Mr. Conington observes with truth that pBicaos means "violently " rather than " powerfully "; and on the strength of this he prefers piclos, and translates " strange as it may seem (Trou), the free gift of the gods is forced on men ". But we may fairly reply that the poet merely meant Pacoss &amp;PX6&amp;vrcov, " ruling by the law of constraint, and not allowing mortals to follow their own headstrong wills with impunity"' (Paley, ad loc.).</page><page sequence="9">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS 63 as a X&amp;pis &amp;Xapis. The word xxpti is being used ironically; what is described as a Xapts is the forcing upon men by the gods of the kind of acoxpoveiv that comes to them against their will. The notion that the maintenance by the gods of a definite scheme of punishment for offences against their laws lets us ' know where we are', and is therefore on that account called a Xapti seems to me far too hard to supply from the context, as well as far too sophisticated, for any audience to have under- stood it.31 To sum up, the so-called ' Zeus-hymn ' seems to me to yield no evidence whatsoever in favour of 'advanced conceptions ', let alone an 'Aeschylean Zeus-religion '. On the contrary, it is set entirely within the primitive framework of the theology of the Works and Days of Hesiod. So is the part played by Zeus throughout the trilogy. At Ag. 1485 f., the Chorus finally confirm the fear already present in their minds during the parodos, and roundly affirm that Zeus is responsible for all that has passed: Ub ItIi lt Ai 0t"s -rravaIrTiou arraEpyETa. -ri ydp ppoTrols &amp;vEu As TrEXEiTroai; -ri Trov8' oi OE6Kpcv-r6v rTIV ; I do not think it possible to doubt that this is one of those passages in which the chorus pronounces a judgment which the poet wishes us to accept. One thinks at once of that passage of the Niobe which Plato singled out for special reprobation, the passage whose speaker asserts that the god first manufactures a pretext, when he is bent on the destruction of a mortal.32 The surrounding context of these lines, which is known to us from a papyrus fragment published by Vitelli and Medea Norsa in 1933, makes it easier to recognise what should in any case have been surmised, that the speaker of these lines does not assert that Zeus punishes the innocent; a view which, if it could safely be re- garded as the poet's own, would be at variance with a famous passage of the Agamemnon (750 ff.) in which the Chorus certainly seems to speak for Aeschylus in asserting the opposite opinion. But the Niobe passage says nothing about why Zeus decides utterly to destroy a house; it only says that, once he has decided to, he manufactures some immediate cause for trouble. The Chorus of the Agamemnon recognises that Zeus has ordained the king's death; but it warns Clytemnestra that the law of Dike requires that she and Aegisthus in their turn shall pay the penalty; and in spite of her talk of a compact with the daimon, she knows that they speak the truth (1560-77). In the next play, Orestes is the instrument of this law; Apollo is not lying when he tells the Erinyes (Eum. 616 ff.) that every utterance of his shrine has behind it the authority of Zeus (cf. 17-19, 713, 797). The speech in the Choephori (264 ff.) in which Orestes implores Zeus to help him to his vengeance is one of great interest, though it has never been a favourite with the advocates of Zeus-religion. 'If you destroy the nestlings of the eagle (Electra and myself), how shall you have from such a hand as ours, the banquets that are your due ? If you cut off the race of the eagle, you will never more be able to convey to mortals the signals that they must obey; and if this whole royal stock wither away, never more will it do duty to your altars on the days of the sacrifice of oxen.'

Neither here nor anywhere in the great Kommos which follows this scene does the alleged advanced conception of Zeus make its appearance; we find only an appeal (382 f.) to Zeus as the sender of uUTrEpobrolvov QTrQtv to the evil among mortals. The later utterances of the Chorus conform to the pattern we have come to expect. The sword of Dike will strike down those who have transgressed against the majesty of Zeus (639-45); Zeus is prayed to grant Orestes victory at 783 f.; after the killings, the Chorus declares that Dike is their author (947 if.). 31 W. Headlam (Agamemnon, p. 187, followed by F. M. Cornford, Plato's Cosmology, p. 361) suggests that -roo might be written instead of rrov, and the sentence taken as a question; he would then translate, 'Where is there any joy of deities who sit upon their awful seat violently ? ' He may be right in taking the sentence as a question, but his translation scarcely suits the sense. If the sentence were a question, it would be better rendered, 'And where is the favour shown by the gods who sit on their dread bench through violence? ' A close parallel is found in the desperate appeal of Croesus on the funeral pyre (Bacchyl. 3, 37-8): ~rrsppe 8SaiTiov, [ wo]oG OECvv xripv xipts; where Xdpts means 'grace ', 'favour', 'gratitude'. In this context, the Chorus may well ask where is the Xapts of the gods; the implication would, of course, be that it is hard to see any. Cf. P. Oxy. 2251, 4-5 (fr. 280 in my appendix to the Loeb edition). 32 H. J. Mette, Supplementum Aeschyleum, fr. 116, 1. 14-15; D. L. Page, Greek Literary Papyri I, p. 8. Loeb, Aeschylus fr. 277.</page><page sequence="10">64 HUGH LLOYD-JONES One of the many advantages to be got by ceasing to demand from Aeschylus a sophisticated and advanced theology is that of being free to recognise the naive dramaturgy of the Eumenides for what it is. The issue lies between the law of Zeus, who as the champion of Dike demands through his rrpopIi'rlns Apollo that the doer shall suffer, and the ancient "nip'l of the Erinyes, who pursue the slayers of their own kin. At the trial, Orestes calls upon Apollo to prove that his action was just (609 f.) : he does not deny the action, but let Apollo say whether it was just or not. Apollo replies that it was just; this assertion he confirms by his authority as p&amp;'vT1s, and this in turn he justifies by declaring that all his utterances as pav-riS are dictated by the commands of Zeus. What Zeus orders must be just; and he calls upon the jury to follow Zeus' will (614 f.). The Chorus asks whether Zeus really can have commanded the oracle to order Orestes to kill his mother; and Apollo replies by explaining that the murder of a woman is a much less serious matter than the treacherous killing of a great prince and warrior. ' As you make it out ', reply the Chorus, ' Zeus reckons more of a father's death than of a mother's; but Zeus threw his own aged father into chains.' This remark gets Apollo on the raw. With extreme rudeness he points out that prisoners can always be released, but that once a man is dead, he cannot be recalled to life. 640 ff.: Xo. a-rpbSpo&amp; Trpo'-p, ZEvs p 6pov Tr) ca, 3X6yc,. carS 8' E rlaE rEtra-rpc( ppei3-rUrlv Kp6vov. -rrne Tac-rcr Ta -roito Oi aVK VVTer, for ,c sysgi; ArTr.

When the votes are found to be equal and Athena has to decide the issue, she justifies her acquittal of Oreates on what has always been felt by most people to be a trivial ground; she herself has no mother, and is therefore more sympathetic to the father's rights. In fact, one may well wonder why the Erinyes ever agreed to her appointment as arbiter; for as daughter of Zeus and sister of Apollo she could hardly appear likely to support the ancient powers against the new ones. When the verdict is given, they scarcely accept it with a good grace. Their first impulse is to blast the land of Athens with their power, and only in the face of a direct threat of Zeus' thunder do they at length accept Athene's tempting offer. 826-7: Knycn -r rhirroitea Zsrvi, Kai g t i pEi EXEysIV ; Kal KX-Ias olba 8ba-ro'o&amp; lvr6Vri O8Ev Ev 6 KEpaUV6o EOTr1V EaqpayialaEvos. We are commonly told that one of the main purposes of the trilogy is to show how the primitive vengeance of the Erinyes was replaced by the rule of law; but nowhere does the text say that the Eumenides are now handing over their functions to the Areopagus. They nowhere promise to give up their present pursuits; and nothing in the play justifies the belief that the transition from the blood-feud to the trial by jury is the main theme of the trilogy. An examination of the surviving plays apart from the Prometheus seems to lead to what many people will find the startling conclusion that Aeschylus' conception of Zeus contains nothing that is new, nothing that is sophisticated, and nothing that is profound. But is this conclusion, after all, surprising? No advanced theology of the kind Aeschylus is so often credited with is found in any Greek author before Plato, a fact which Nilsson (see n. 8) acknowledges with some surprise. If Aeschylus was in truth a solitary pioneer of an advanced theology, one would expect to find Plato acknowledging the fact with gratitude and admiration; but this is not the case. In Books II and III of the Republic, Platoe delivers a fierce attack upon the famous poets of Greece for the corrupting character of the myths which they relate, and from this attack Aeschylus is far from being exempt. The first charge brought against the poets, that of representing the gods as doing violence to one another, is not specifically levelled against Aeschylus, though the Prometheus itself could have furnished an excellent example. But as an instance of the second crime of the poets, that of represent- ing the gods as being responsible for evil, Plato quotes the passage of the Niobe which I have men- tioned (Resp. 380 A); as an instance of the third crime, that of making out the gods as capable tascpbeof deceit, he quotes the disguise assumed by Hera in the Semele (ib. 381 D); and at the conclusion of the second book he cites, in summing up his remarks upon this head, Thetis' famous denunciation of Apollo's treachery (fr. 350, quoted at 383 A-B). Of the crimes of representing death as terrible and of crediting gods and heroes with unbecoming behaviour or with unbecoming sentiments, Aeschylus is not specifically accused, but it is clear that he would not have been acquitted. Now whatever Aeschylus might have said about the other gods, it is highly probable that if he had put forward a conception of Zeus that verged in places on the severe and abstract monotheism which Plato would have approved, Plato would not have included him in his general condemnation of</page><page sequence="11">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS 65 the poets. Plato, it is true, had little sense of historical accuracy and was capable of unfairness to his predecessors; but I find it hard to believe he would have been so unfair and unintelligent as this.33 It seems possible, and indeed probable, that Plato lumped together Aeschylus with the rest simply because Aeschylus shared the common beliefs and assumptions about the gods. Aeschylus certainly makes Zeus supreme; so is he supreme in Homer. Numerous passages could be cited to show that Aeschylus, just as much as Homer, believed in the efficacy of gods other than Zeus, of Apollo and Athene, Artemis and Ares, Hera and Poseidon; numerous others indicate his belief in the quasi-personal existence of the indeterminate daemonic beings in whom the average Athenian of the fifth century undoubtedly believed, Hybris and Dike, Eris and Koros, Ate and Kratos.34 His presentation of the gods could not be more patently anthropomorphic. They have mouths, feet, arms and eyes; 85 they have special means of transport and use special weapons.36 Not only are the other gods often introduced upon the stage, but in the Psychostasia Zeus himself figured as a character. The gods constantly pursue mortal women, especially Zeus.37 If Aeschylus had ever heard of Heraclitus or Xenophanes and their attempts to inculcate a more refined notion of divinity, there is nothing in his works to prove it.3s Further, there can be little doubt that the view of Zeus and Dike that we find in Aeschylus is not materially different from that of Hesiod. Any advance we do find has appeared well over a hundred years before Aeschylus in the work of another Athenian poet, Solon, who presents the notion of Zeus as the champion of Dike and also the doctrine of K6pOS followed by &amp;'rrl or Oppts in a form in no important way different from what we find at Ag. 750 ff. (see fr. I Diehl). Scholars have expended much learning and ingenuity in tracing a gradual development in ethical profundity from Homer to Hesiod, from Hesiod to the lyric poets and early elegists, from lyric to Aeschylus, from Aeschylus to Sophocles. Much of their work has no relation to what is in the texts, but is simply a product of the nineteenth century's insistence upon progress in all matters and its conviction that the power of poetry must reside chiefly, if not wholly, in the ideas, and especially the ethical ideas, which it expresses. In fact, as Plato naturally recognised, the similarity of general outlook between all these poets is far more striking than the differences between them. Almost the only scrap of Aeschylus' talk that has come down to us in the remark (in Athenaeus viii 374 E) that his dramas were 'slices from the great banquets of Homer'. I suggest that this may be a more valuable indication of his poetic views than is commonly sup- posed. It is time to return to the problem of the Prometheus trilogy; how are we to reconcile the presentation of Zeus in the surviving play as a harsh and ruthless tyrant, the torturer of the great champion of mankind, with the 'advanced' Zeus we find elsewhere in Aeschylus? Does the rejection of the view that Zeus' character 'developed' in the course of the trilogy oblige us to follow Schmid in believing that the surviving play is not by Aeschylus ? If the view of Zeus in Aeschylus for which I have argued is correct, there is no reason to suppose the Zeus of the P. V. to be un- aeschylean. Zeus may well honour Dike because she was on his side against his father, and uphold her T~ril among men. But for Zeus himself to feel scruples in dealing with a challenge to his own authority would be quite another thing. Any government maintains justice among its subjects, but few governments refer to the arbitration of abstract justice disputes with powers which have challenged their own authority. Further, one must be on one's guard against supposing that the god who is for mankind is necessarily to be thought of as ' good ' and the god who is against mankind is necessarily ' bad'. The fifth-century Zeus was not a democratic god, who could never, for fear of losing his job, do anything not in the best interests of the human race. Hesiod, in whose works Aeschylus' mind was soaked, records without expressing disapproval Zeus' annihilation of at least one of the four successive races of mankind. Nor does he feel the fifth race, to which he himself belongs, to have received particularly favourable treatment at Zeus' hands. The gods, he says (op. 42 f.), have concealed from men the means of subsistence (Pios); a man could easily do enough work in a day to keep himself for a year, had Zeus not concealed subsistence from us in his anger against Prometheus. No resentment against Zeus is expressed; that would be presumption, and would invite punishment; but neither is his benevolence stressed. What is emphasised, in 33 I am grateful to Mr. D. A. Rees for urging upon me the usefulness of this argument from Plato. 34 All mentions of each god and daimon in Aeschylus are conveniently listed by W. Kausche, Mythologumena Aeschylea (Diss Philol.

Zeus pursues Io in the Supplices and P.V., Europe in the Kares, Semele in the Semele-trilogy, Danae in the Perseus-trilogy, and no doubt Callisto in the Callisto. 38 I do not trouble to show how feeble is the evidence ad- duced by those who have tried to prove him acquainted with the works of these writers. Wm. Nestle's remarks, in the article already quoted (Griechische Studien pp. 122-3), provides a fair specimen. Neither shall I deal with the attempts which some have made, encouraged by a light-hearted remark of Cicero (' Aeschylus, non solum poeta sed etiam Pythagoreus...', Tusc. ii. Io, 23), to prove Aeschylus a Pythagorean or an Orphic. On the Lycurgus trilogy and its connection with Orpheus, see the sensible remarks of I. M. Linforth (The Arts of Orpheus, p. Io). VOL. LXXVI. F</page><page sequence="12">66 HUGH LLOYD-JONES Hesiod and also in tragedy, is the supremacy of his power and the uselessness of trying to deceive him or in any way resist his will. The whole of Greek poetry from Homer to Sophocles abounds with illustrations of this attitude. The gods by their laws encourage righteousness among men. But they themselves are not obliged to obey those laws, nor should we be reasonable to expect it. The poets talk not of the righteousness of the gods, but of their power, and of their insistence that we be righteous; they insist upon the excellence of their laws, but still more upon the foolishness of trying to oppose their will. There is a sentence in the Magna Moralia which well illustrates one facet of this difference: ' It would be odd if anyone were to say he loved Zeus' (Mgn. Mor. 1208 B 30 oTorTov El "rt1 ~pail q9Ih.iv T6OV Aia).39 There is no reason why a god whom his worshippers regard with this degree of respectful detachment should not be portrayed by one of them as acting ruthlessly, particularly since in this instance Zeus was defending his own supremacy against a challenge. Zeus has a far closer and more personal relation to the action of this play than he has to that of any other surviving work of Aeschylus. Prometheus is a personal enemy, who has defied Zeus' authority; why should Zeus show him mercy, any more than he showed mercy to any other of his defeated rivals? Of course, it is unreasonable to argue that the Zeus of the P. V. is the object of the actual hostility of the poet. Aeschylus is not 'for' or 'against' either Zeus or Prometheus. His immediate purpose is not educative, but dramatic; and he must so hold the balance between the protagonists in the central conflict as to exploit to the full the dramatic possibilities which the story offers. Prometheus is indeed shown with much sympathy; but it does not follow that the audience is meant to regard Zeus with the indignation that we naturally feel. The warnings of the Chorus against excessive ac0a8ia have been seized upon by those who have regarded Prometheus himself as being the guilty party. This is ridiculous; but the warnings do serve to remind us that if Prometheus' attitude is magnificent, it is also unrealistic. And unrealism of this kind, the refusal to recognise one's own helplessness in the face of superior power, is a fault that Aeschylus, like other Greek poets, constantly reprobates. The point is made still clearer by the warning of Oceanus, a character whom some scholars have absurdly misunderstood. He offers to intercede with Zeus, at his own risk (325 f., 337 f.); and Prometheus himself acknowledges that some risk could be involved (340-I). What more he could have done, I cannot see. As his offer is rejected, there is nothing left for him to do but to warn Prometheus to moderate the violence of his utterances, a warning which Prometheus would have done well to heed. For all he gets by his rash defiance is an intensification of his punishment.40 With this in mind we return to such positive indications as we possess of how Zeus and Pro- metheus became reconciled.41 Among these, the prophecies uttered by Prometheus himself in the Desmotes have a peculiar authority; and if we examine them, we find that again and again Pro- metheus declares that by his possession of the secret about Thetis he will force Zeus to release him. 'I swear', he says (167 f.), ' that the chief of the blessed ones shall yet have need of me, tortured though I am in mighty fetters, to reveal the new design through which he stands to lose his sceptre and his prerogatives. And never shall he coax me by the honey-tongued incantations of Persuasion, never shall I cower before his harsh threats and reveal this secret, till he release me from those cruel bonds and be willing to render me atonement for this outrage.' 'I know', he says later (185 f.), ' I know that Zeus is hard and keeps Justice by his side; but none the less, soft shall his resolution be when by this means he is crushed; and making smooth his rugged temper, he shall come to union and to friendship with me no less eagerly than I.' Observe that in this early scene with the Chorus, Prometheus says that his knowledge of the secret will force Zeus to release him; this statement he repeats at 524-5. In the final scene (908 f.) he talks of the disaster Zeus will suffer if he makes the fated marriage as though it is bound to overtake him. That, no doubt, is intended as a way of threatening Zeus, who as he must know, will hear his words. For though Prometheus knows that Zeus will eventually release him, Zeus can be made to do this only if he knows of the threat which overhangs him. We know, in any case, that Zeus did not suffer destruction; and we may therefore easily infer that it was by revealing the secret that Prometheus purchased his release. Now if Zeus has in the meantime reformed in character, it is odd that he should need the threat of impending disaster to lead him to pardon his noble adversary; this argument, which I have not before seen used, surely confirms arguments against believing that Prometheus owed his release to a change of heart on the part of Zeus which I set out earlier. The change of attitude by the Eumenides is 39 See E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and The Irrational, p. 35, with note. Ar. Rhet. 1391 B says that Edfrvxia makes men &lt;pth66EOl. But the context indicates that this means little more than that they are disposed to accept the decisions of the rulers of the uni- verse in an uncomplaining spirit. 'Of the major Olympians', Dodds writes, 'perhaps only Athena inspired an emotion that could reasonably be described as love.' It is probable that in other cities beside Athens the local tutelary god inspired a similar feeling (Hera at Argos, Apollo at Delphi and Delos, etc.). 40 Much misunderstanding has been caused by 11. 342-3: iI&amp;'rTv y&amp;p ooSiv c~bqpEX?)V iol0 rrov~EIt, El TI Kal rrovEiv OXElS. Denniston (G.P., p. 303) correctly explains the last phrase as meaning ' if you want to labour '; no doubt of the sincerity of Oceanus' offer is implied. 41 If there was a god to whom the Greeks assigned a not dissimilar relation of partiality, protection, and patronage towards the whole of humanity, it was Prometheus. And they did not conceive of Prometheus as having any share in the government of the universe. This is the prerogative of Zeus, PIaicos apa aEjiv6v pEVO.</page><page sequence="13">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS 67 indeed a parallel, but one which indicates the opposite of what it has often been supposed to. The Eumenides do not change their character, but they do a deal with Athene, and in consequence their attitude changes. So, I suggest, must Zeus have done a deal with Prometheus, and changed his attitude in consequence. The deal once concluded, it is likely that the trilogy ended in an atmosphere of mutual con- cession and reconciliation, such as Heracles was a peculiarly fit person to promote. It may well have been indicated that Zeus would not renew the attempt to destroy the human race which Prometheus (231 f.) has claimed to have frustrated, we do not know how. But in view of the ex- plicit words of Prometheus' prophecy, it seems certain that Prometheus' possession of the secret regarding Zeus' dangerous marriage must have played an indispensable part in making this recon- ciliation possible. Why was this motive necessary to the poet ? Firstly, no doubt, because it was part of the myth; secondly, because no Greek of Aeschylus' time or earlier thought of Zeus as having that special relation of patronage and protection towards mankind which the Jews and Christians have assigned to God.42 Zeus is indeed the champion of Dike, a rough retributive justice; he insists that men, like gods, shall keep his law. This is an important function, and it plays a central part in the action of Aeschylus' plays. That the moral background it provides has great importance, I am very far from wishing to deny. What I do deny is that they contain an advanced morality involving an ascription to Zeus of greater power than earlier poets had assigned him and a belief in his regeneration of mankind through suffering. This rude morality serves as an indispensable background to the action. But there is no reason for thinking that the dramatist's main purpose was to commend it to his audience. There was nothing new in it, and among most Athenians there will have been little disposition to dispute it. Aeschylus probably never thought of doubting it, and to that extent his plays may certainly be said to recommend it. I will conclude by quoting some words of Hermann's, set originally in the context of a by no means wholly acceptable polemic against Welcker's reconstruction of the trilogy, but applicable to other opinions besides Welcker's. 'Sed aliud longe est fabulae rationem exponere, aliud explicare consilium poetae, praesertim scaenici, qui non docere, sed placere populo, aut si docere, non docere per aenigmata abstrusae cuiusdam sapientiae, sed per viva constantiae, fortitudinis, animi magnitudinis exempla velit. Ab eo trilogiam factam credere, ut istiusmodi doctrinae philosophicae satisfaceret, alienissimum a sana ratione est, neque utilius, quam quaerere (et quaesiverunt quidam) quomodo in Iovis persona crudelissimi tyranni exemplum proponere potuerit. Neque habuerunt ista apud Graecos offen- sionem, nec potuerunt habere, ut in religionibus, quae totae ex huiuscemodi fabulis essent compositae' (Opusc. viii, 255-6). HUGH LLOYD-JONES Corpus Christi College, Oxford. 42 Since Aeschylus everywhere works against the background of the system of moral order I have tried to describe, and therefore in a sense may be said to 'teach' that it is true, this statement may be thought to go too far. But the ' teaching' which poets are said by the Aristophanic Aeschylus (Ran. Io054-5) to provide was probably held to consist chiefly in the depiction of ' viva constantiae, fortitudinis, animi magnitudinis exempla' (cf. ib. 1019-22) and not in the propagation of new religious or philosophical doctrines.</page></plain_text>
