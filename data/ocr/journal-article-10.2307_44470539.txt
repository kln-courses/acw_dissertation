Begian ILC-Dover ABSTRACT Retracting one or both arms from a space suit's sleeves into its torso has been envi- sioned as a means to enhance a crewperson's performance during repeated extended duration extravehicular activity (EVA). The purpose of this paper is to present considerations germain to the incorporation of an arm/ arms-in feature in a space suit. It assesses what can be done with one and two arms-in; it presents the expected impacts to the wearer and the suit; and it discusses the operational feasibility of employing arm/ arms-in. SPACE STATION EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITY (EVA) scenarios impose a set of space suit requirements that are distinct from those imposed on the Shuttle space suit. Some of these requirements are: minimization of prebreathing, rapid don/doff, on orbit resizing, enhanced radiation protection, extended service life, and long duration wear comfort. This paper addressed one aspect of long duration wear comfort. Its purpose is to evaluate the benefits of retracting one or both arms from the space suit's sleeves into its torso, to enhance a crew- person's performance during repeated extended duration EVA. In addition, considerations germain to the incorporation of an arm/arms- in feature are presented, including: functions accomplished with one and two arms- in; expected wearer and suit impacts; and the operational feasibility of employing arm/ arms-in. WHAT CAN BE DONE Assume for a moment that once the arms are within the torso, the hands are afforded 7.220 unrestricted mobility. In this situation, the hands may be used to assist in eating, drinking, collecting wastes (urine, feces and vomit), scratching, wiping, and adjusting clothing and gear. If one hand will suffice to accomplish these feats, the suit may be designed to provide "arm-in". If both hands are required and/or desired to perform these tasks, the suit must incorporate provisions for "arms-in". Both terms are used in this paper when a dis- criminator is being presented between the "arm-in" and "arms-in" modes. Otherwise the term "arm/arms-in" is used. Regardless of whether one or both hands are in the torso, a sequence of generic steps can be defined to execute each in-suit activity. Table 1 outlines these steps for both the arm/arms-in and no arm/arms-in cases. For example, suppose you need to urinate or defecate. In the arm/arms-in mode, you first retract your arm(s) from the suit's sleeves(s). You then locate a containment device, remove it from its in-suit stowage area, move it into position, and actuate it (if required). After use, you prepare the unit for stowage, move it to its stowage site, and stow it. If body cleansing is desired, you must destow, use, and restow a wipe; repeating the sequence to clean your hand(s) before replacing your arm(s) in the sleeve(s) . In the no arm/arms-in mode, you would have to wear a device and/or garment that could be used upon demand without real-time hand attendance. Generally speaking, such unattended devices are more complex than their hand-attended counterparts, which employ the hand and brain as part of the system. It must be recognized, however, that the zero gravity environment of space demands a certain level of complexity of almost all devices, whether or not they are hand-attended. Consider the case of vomitus containment. 0096-736X/87/9507-0220$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">860951 T- I UJ CO &lt; -O E CD CD +-&gt; 4-5 C 4-5 fö « - .

In space this method would work fine for initial containment. However, once the top of the bag is sealed to prevent escape of free floating matter, you have confounded further use of the system. Gasping for air while the bag was still around your mouth could prove to be hazardous, as could reopening the bag for additional use. While a directional control valve might provide an easy solution, you now have to contend with vomit upstream of the valve and orifice clogging by high solids content. The point of this discussion is that when compared to the level of complexity required to employ a device in space, the added complexity to use that device without hands does not seem so great. For the most part, the deter- mination between no, one or both arms-in depends upon the need for the accessory devices to be hand attended. For example, eating of bite-off and bite sized foods could be accomplished by mouth actuated devices; however, eating of pastes and more complex foods may require one or two handed assistance. Even with two hands inside the torso there are limitations to what can be easily consumed. The use of sharp or pointed utensils should be avoided because their inadvertent escape could be hazardous within the confines of the suit. Spoonable or hand held foods are viable candidates provided they are not likely to drift away or produce crumbs. Of course, as with all in-suit activities, consideration must also be given to the amount of vision (and illu- mination) required to locate and employ accessory devices with one and both hands. This section opened with the assumption that the hands have unrestricted mobility within the torso. This assumption is not entirely true when the torso is part of an anthropomorphic space suit bearing arms and legs. The arm and leg openings are positioned via human anatomy, placing some bounds on the torso geometry. The ease with which the hand can access various parts of the body and suit stowage areas depends upon the ease with which the arm can move within the confines of the torso. Because the hand is the last to leave the sleeve upon arm retraction, it enters the torso at the scye opening while the arm is bent at the side of the chest. (See Figure 1.) With the elbow close to the body, the hand can reach into the helmet, over both shoulders, under the opposite arm, and into the front and back of the brief. In these areas, the hand alone (without accessory devices) can be used to scratch, rub and adjust clothing and gear. (It should be remembered that the same hand that adjusts, might accidentally or intentionally remove equipment.) Without hands, some face scratching and rubbing can be accomplished via contact with devices mounted inside the helmet, such as the current valsalva device. Of course the body surface area covered by contact with a helmet mounted device is considerably less than the area covered by one or both hands in the torso, which is considerably less than that covered by either one or both hands not confined within the torso. The point is that while arms-in offers more coverage than no arms-in, it cannot relieve every conceivable annoyance. Actual mission data shows that no conceivable annoyance has interfered with the performance of any EVA mission to date. From Apollo 15 (1971) to STS 51A (1984) there have been 18 2-person EVA's (Soviet and American) of over 5 hours in duration. (1)* Not counting training, this provides 36 data points of successful, long duration EVA's that have not employed arm/arms-in. More recently, EVA astronauts Jerry Ross and Woody Spring (2) recommended two types of in-suit breaks for use during Space Station assembly-type operations, such as the EASE/ACCESS exercises they conducted on two EVA's during STS 61B. One type of break is a mental break from concentration on repetitive tasks. This break could be achieved by scheduling some variety into the task timeline. The other type of break is a physical break from repeated use of one set of muscles. This type of break might also be accomplished by task variety, although the muscular requirements of each task would have to be determined before the effectiveness of this method could be speculated. Interestingly, both Ross and Spring speculated that they would by-pass the opportunity for a return-to-airlock lunch break during a 6-hour EVA, prefering to "keep on trucking", as Ross put itš Ross also provided some insight into the upper limit of suit wear, stating that even feeling "right at home" in suits, seven to eight hours is "long enough at a time". (3) This range corresponds to the amount of total suited time currently required to support a 6-hour EVA. In the future, a zero pre- breathe cabin-to-suit pressure differential will allow a greater percentage of the total suited time to be EVA dedicated. In summary, this section presented the types of activities that can be conducted with and without arm/arms-in. It linked to those activities a series of generic steps, and a description of the complexity of their accessory devices. It also described the reach range of one and both hands within the torso, and it presented some perspective from EVA experience to date. *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. 7.222</page><page sequence="4">860951 SEQUENCE FOR ARM IN FIGURE 1 7.223</page><page sequence="5">The following section discusses the impacts of arm/arms-in. IMPACTS OF ARM/ARMS-IN There are several ways to categorize the types of impacts arm/arms-in would inspire. The focus of this section is on suit and wearer impacts. A preliminary arm/arms-in assessment was conducted at ILC Dover under NASA Contract NAS9-17260, "Alternate Body Seal Closure Program". As depicted in Figure 2, this assessment revealed that a considerable volume aft of the scye openings is required to retract/insert the arms from/into the suit sleeves. Many factors contribute to this volume, including body dimensions and the wearer's mobility; vent duct inter- ference; scye size, location and orientation; and technique. Although the specific contri- butions of these factors were not quantified, the following general observations were noted: 1. The swept path of the shoulder(s) determines the volumetric requirement for arm/arms-in, and 2. Less volume is required to provide arm-in than is required to provide arms-in. An increased fore/aft dimension impacts stowage, airlock and hatch dimensions, suit weight, and pressure loads. The volume aft of the scye openings inspires some other suit architecture consid- erations. One of these is brought on because body forces are transmitted to the suit through physical contact. The forces are distributed over the area of contact. Open space behind the wearer's back reduces the contact area available to transmit the forces required to bend backward and to straighten after bending forward. These two motions are particularly important to a foot restrained astronaut who bends forward to increase reach range, and backward to increase field of view. While it is conceiv- able that sufficient force could be transmit- ted to the torso through the arms or shoulders to compensate for the loss of back contact, the diminished contact area may concentrate the force and create pressure points. More significant complications would arise if the wearer's back tended to drift into the arm/arms-in volume, causing the wearer's arms to back out of the sleeves. This condition would require that the hands (which must maintain their location in the gloves in order to perform useful work) hold the arms in the sleeves. Because the hands tend to fatigue while performing standard EVA tasks, placing any additional burden on them is not recommended. A harness or pad restraint positioned behind the wearer's back would minimize the aforementioned problems, although the design challenge of making this restraint disappear during arm/arms-in activity could be considerable. Imagine that you have your hands in the gloves and are being held in the work position (forward in the torso) by a harness or pad. In order to bring your arms in, you must first free yourself of this restraint. This action can be ini- tiated by an actuator on the outside of the suit, or by voice actuation, or by mouth actuation (say by opening a bite valve on a tube connected to an inflatable pad). Once free of the restraint, you may retract your arms and conduct arms-in activities: eat, urinate, vomit, etc. Upon completion of arms-in activities, you would replace your arms in the sleeves and reactivate the restraint. Determing the need for such a restraint should be a prime consideration in the pursuit of arm/arms-in. If such a restraint is required, the question must be raised whether it would be more desirable to add complexity to the suit for hand attended food, drink and waste management, or to the accessory devices for non-hand attended operation. The suit's ventilation system may also be impacted by arm/arms-in. Airflow through the ventilation system of the Shuttle space suit's liquid cooling ventilation garment (LCVG) totals 6 cfm during EVA. Four ducts join to meet this requirement, one each sucking air from each hand and foot. The ducts travel up the arms and legs to a plenum at the back of the garment which directs the flow of the backpack. (See Figure 3.) The ducts are sized to assure that one-half to two- thirds of the total flow is provided by the arm ducts. This equates to 3 to 4 cfm. (4) Airflow is provided to the helmet to facilitate unencumbered breathing up to 6 cfm, which corresponds to a maximum breathing capacity. This volume flow rate can only be voluntarily maintained for very short periods. (5) During moderate exercise, people breathe about 2 cfm. This is called their respiratory minute volume. When an astronaut places one or both hands in the oro-nasal region of his/her face, he/she is also placing one or both arm vent duct terminators in that area, thereby sucking Ik to 4 cfm of air from it. Although this is not a life threatening condition, it could certainly raise a comfort and fatigue issue as the wearer would be forced to breathe against the power of the vent loop. Travelling with the hands, the vent duct terminators could create some other problems, such as drying the eyes or collecting spills. The latter could present a cleaning problem for the ducts, 7.224</page><page sequence="6">860951 HUT DEPTH VS. SCYE DIAMETER FOR ARM/ARMS IN FIGURE 2 LARGEST CHEST CIRCUMFERENCE.

Vent lines that are attached to the suit walls would minimize these problems. Such a design was used in the past, prior to the design of the modular Shuttle suit. In order to implement such a design in the Shuttle or Space Station suit, special consideration must be given not only to modularity, but to multiple bearing construc- tion, duct cleaning and change out, and the parting planes employed for don/doff. While it is conceivable that these challenges can be designed around, they will inspire additional suit complexity. Hand attended urine and fecal collection may also impact suit architecture. As described in Section 2.0, the hand is not afforded unrestricted mobility within the torso envelope because the elbow must remain fairly close to the body. (See Figure 4.) This is of particular significance when reaching into the brief. In this case, the restrictions placed on elbow locus cause the forearm to slide along the torso while the hand moves from the front to the back of the brief. This path drives the brief to be large enough to accommodate the fore- arm as well as the hips (plus whatever extra volume would be required to employ waste management devices). Of course, not only must the brief be larger; the passageway from the upper to lower torso must also be larger. If a waist joint is included in this passageway, it will require a larger diameter. Due to the geometry of joint movement, a larger joint diameter must also be longer in order to provide the same range. (See Figure 5.) A longer joint reduces the amount of realiz- able torso length downsizing, a parameter which is already adversely constrained by the back entry suit concepts being considered for Space Station. It could be argued that the upper torso envelope should be defined by the locus of the elbow that will provide unrestricted hand movement in the torso, rather than by the smaller envelope (defined by the locus of the shoulder) required to retract/ insert the arm/arms. Unfortunately, because the elbow and waist occupy the same hori- zontal plane of the body, providing the elbow a larger locus will automatically require a larger waist joint. (See Figure 6.) On the basis of this assessment, it can be concluded that providing hand attended urine and fecal collection will limit RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JOINT DIAMETER AND LENGTH FOR GIVEN DESIRED RANGE FIGURE 5 7.228</page><page sequence="10">860951 ELBOW LOCUS COMPARED TO SHOULDER LOCUS IN TORSO FIGURE 6 either torso downsizing capability or waist mobility, by inspiring a larger waist joint. Elimination of the need for a waist joint would go a long way toward providing a torso compatible with arm/arms-in. (Such a torso may resemble those employed in atmospheric diving suits, such as the "NEWTSUIT", shown in Figure 7.) Although the amount of waist mobility required for EV activity has yet to be quantified, comparative one-g mobility checks of existing waist/hip designs revealed a dramatic loss of range accompanying waist joint lock-out. (6) (See Figure 8.) Work is in progress at Ames Research Center to design a brief that will allow the same bend range as the current waist/hip combina- tion. Of course, the torso must not only allow room to use hand attended devices; it must provide their stowage space as well. Stowage space must be accessible. As explained in Section 2, one hand can reach into the helmet, over both shoulders, under the opposite arm, and into the front and back of the brief. With both arms-in this range may be somewhat reduced, simply because there is less free volume within which to maneuver. Logic dictates that urine and fecal containment devices be located in the brief, and food and water "NEWTSUIT" ATMOSPHERIC DIVING SUIT (ADS) FIGURE 7 7.229</page><page sequence="11">FIGURE 8 7.230 SQUATTING BENDING WITH WAIST JOINT WITHOUT WAIST JOINT WITH WAIST JOINT WITHOUT WAIST JOINT</page><page sequence="12">860951 devices be located in the upper torso. The large neck ring employed on rapid don/ doff suit concepts creates pockets above the shoulders, where the front of the torso blends to the neck ring. (See Figure 9.) This new "collar" of unclaimed real estate provides an easy access site for obth hand attended and unattended devices. With only one arm-in, the "back wall" of the torso under the opposite arm could also provide a stowage site, as long as there was not a restraint pad in the way. The front wall of the torso, although accessible, must maintain a friendly surface with the wearer's chest, limiting somewhat the types of devices that can be stowed there. Ostensibly, there is adequate stowage space for devices that dispense food and water, and for devices that collect urine, feces, and vomit in the arm/arms- in mode. There is also adequate stowage space for devices that dispense food and water and collect vomit in the no arm/arms- in mode. In summary, this section described the expected suit and wearer impacts of providing arm/arms-in. It presented a pre- liminary look at the volume requirements, and it discussed potential problems with, and proposed solutions for: extra volume behind the wearer's back, hand terminated LCVG ducts, urine and fecal collection volume requirements, and suit stowage provisions. OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY For a foot restrained astronaut bringing one arm-in should not be difficult, as the gloved hand can grab the opposite sleeve STOWAGE SITE IN COLLAR AREA OF SUIT EMPLOYING A LARGE NECK RING FIGURE 9 7.231</page><page sequence="13">and stabilize the upper torso from the twisting action of the person retracting their arm. This action in the foot restraints will allow relative motion between the body and the suit. Bringing the second arm in may be somewhat more difficult because the upper torso will have to be stabilized by the inside arm. (Naturally, suit design plays a role in determining the location of stabilizing forces. If the suit relies on hip bearings for twisting, it is likely that the legs can provide the stabilizing forces, assuming the feet are restrained.) For a non-restrained astronaut, the kinetics of retracting even one arm may prohibit the maneuver, since the forces exerted on the suit by the astronaut will tend to move the suit, precluding the necessary relative motion between the arm and the suit. There- fore, it is reasonable to assume that arm/ arms-in requires the use of a foot restraint (or comparable suit restraint). Not all EV activities are conducted from or near restraints. This presents a problem for any arm/arms-in activity requiring rapid response, such as vomiting. Assuming an ill astronaut would not conduct an EVA and that an EVA astronaut who started feeling nauseous would ingress the airlock as soon as possible, sudden onset nausea would be the most likely malady requiring vomi tus containment. In order to respond to such an event with a system designed for hand actuation, the astronaut would have to retract his/her arm(s) and position a vomi tus containment device on his/her face. The ease and speed with which this procedure can be accomplished will determine its effectiveness as an emergency measure. A preliminary step of translating to a restraint site and restraining the suit may not allow sufficient time to set-up the vomi tus containment device. Even if the astronaut is already in a restraint, there may be times when his/her hands are not free to leave the gloves, such as when Joe Allen held the Palapa satellite as part of a retrieval procedure on STS 51A. Consequently, we could be left with a suit that will allow reliable arm/arms-in response to vomiting just some of the time. While a part-time response is admittedly preferable than no response, it is a far cry from the full -time response that could be provided by an unattended device. Considering that an astronaut cannot perform useful work during an arm/arms-in mode, that period will have to be scheduled as a break. For jobs that require the coordinated effort of two people, a break for one person equates to a break for both. While this scenario is acceptable for meal breaks, it could be a nuisance for drinking and waste management, where people's biologi- cal comfort schedules may not be in synch. Imagine having to convince your work buddy that it was time for a break because you have to pull your arms-in to urinate. Buddy system breaks might be required for safety reasons with arms-in. Remembering that the suit can do very little without the astronaut's hands in gloves or end effectors, the question arises of the safety of directing attention inside the suit while essentially incapacitated in a hostile envi- ronment. A buddy could be used to "spot" the person employing arm/arms-in and to alert him/her to any suit-external hazards requiring his/her attention. The consequence of this, of course, is that arm/arms-in would be employed sequentially by the buddy team, so lengthening the break timeline. In contrast to the space environment, where arm/arms-in may be associated with a safety deficit, two safety benefits are realized with arms-in in the atmospheric diving suits used for deep water diving. Located inside these suits is an actuator that will allow the submerged wearer to open the suit and egress in the event of an emergency, such as leakage. The wearer also brings their arms in during suit submersion, when the suit arms could get snagged on nearby obstacles. In summary, this section presented the expected suit restraint requirements to bring one arm and both arms-in, and it discussed the operational feasibility of employing arm/arms-in in terms of rapid response, break schedules, and safety. CONCLUSIONS Six tasks have been identified as candi- date arm/arms-in activities. These are: eat, drink, urinate, defecate, vomit and relieve annoyances (scratch, wipe, adjust). The current space suit assembly (SSA) has provisions to eat, drink and urinate without hand attendance. Containment for feces is provided by the LCVG in the event of an uncontrolled bowel movement. Nose scratching is achievable through contact with the valsalva device. There are no provisions to vomit or to relieve annoyances other than a nose itch, nor are there provi- sions to regularly defecate in the suit. Of the suit provided provisions, there is certainly room for design improvement. EVA experience has reported that the urine collection device is somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to use, conditions that indi- cate a leakage potential. The food stick interferes with the chin, and can gum it up. The ideal set of devices to realize maximum suit internal activities for no arm/arms-in operation consists of: the current drink bag, a new food dispenser, an improved urine collection device, a new fecal containment garment, a new vomi tus containment device, and the current valsalva 7.232</page><page sequence="14">860951 device. With this set of devices, the only activity comprised is some annoyance rei ief . If the assumption regarding the need for a suit restraint is true for arm/arms-in operation, it would be preferable to provide unattended capabilities for drinking, vomiting and collecting urine. These are the three activities that are least likely to lend themselves to scheduled, suit restrained breaks. If use of a waist joint is desired, it may be necessary to provide unattended capabilities for both urine and fecal collection. Doing so will allow the joint/ brief design to be independent of the volume requirements to use and stow these waste management devices. If a back restraint, suit restraint and waist joint are all valid assumptions, then arm/arms-in should only be used for eating and relieving reachable annoyances. These activities are not of themselves adequate payback for the costs of providing arm/arms-in. In perspective, if a back restraint system can be designed for arm/ arms-in use, surely a new food dispenser can be designed to fit in the collar of the Space Station suit and to provide easy, non-hand attended use. Also, assuming adequate performance of the other non-hand attended devices, there is no historical reason to believe that annoyances within the reach range of the hand(s) in the torso will interfere with EV activity. In order to verify the assumptions upon which this paper was based, an arm/ arms-in mock-up should be evaluated in zero gravity. Doing so will help determine its feasibility as a future suit feature.
