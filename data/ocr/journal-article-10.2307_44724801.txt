Wille Brigham Young Univ. Dennis C. Schneider and Alan M. Nahum University of California-San Diego ABSTRACT Results indicate the need for a redesign- ed Hybrid III face capable of accurate force and acceleration measurements. New instrumen- tation and methods for facial fracture detection were developed, including the appli- cation of acoustic emissions. Force/ deflection information for the human cadaver head and the Hybrid III ATD were generated for the fronted, zygomatic, and maxillary regions. THE BIOMECHANICS OF FACIAL IMPACT INJURY has been the subject of research for more than two decades. Pioneering efforts by Swearingen (1)*, Hodgson (2), Nahum, et al (3) and others provided reference data regarding impact fracture tolerance of major facial bones. However, little has been published in bio- mechanical literature regarding overall facial response to impact. Lap and shoulder belt use in severe fronted crashes has increased inter- est in facial fracture injuries. Ihus, the dynamic response of the face has become impor- tant as it relates not only to facial trauma per se, but as it affects the overall head dynamics and associated potential brain in- jury. The work of Nyquist, et al (4) was designed to derive biomechanical data from impact loadings with a round circular rod, similar to a steering wheel rim. The work reported here had two bio- mechanical objectives. Recent work on load- and-pressure-sensing anthropomorphic dummy faces indicates that although forces were measured with the dummy face, (5, 6) it is unlikely that those measurements represent forces on the human head during facial impact. The dynamic deflection responses of the stiff dummy skull, through which these forces are transmitted, are significantly different from those of the human skull. Hence, the first goal was to identify the large-deformation response of the human skull. The deformation response was determined experimentally by application of a perpendicu- lar transverse impact along the mid saggital planes of the skull of severed cadaver heads, with impact sites at the maxillary, zygomatic and supra-orbital frontal bone locations. The specimens were subjected to complete autopsy examinations after the impacts had been per- formed. The second objective of this work was to augment the data for small diameter cylindri- cal facial impact, but with more detailed instrumentation for force distribution over the skull. The design of an experiment to accom- modate these objectives with a finite number of biomechanical specimens proved challenging. The identification of the onset of fracture by any kind of bracketing technique appeared to be prohibitive from a cost and biomaterials standpoint in view of the rather broad varia- tion in facial anatomy in humans. Establishing fracture thresholds by utilizing multiple, gradually- increasing impacts at a given impact site was discarded, since the influence of prefracture impacts on a sub- sequent fracture threshold would be difficult to determine. Furthermore, the identification of a hairline fracture in a test specimen requires complete dissection of the overlying tissue, thereby rendering the specimen un- usable for further testing. This dilemma was resolved by a major- force impact technique. A special array of instrumentation was used to monitor force level as a heavy weight impactor drove sub- stantially into the skull structure at successive impact sites on each specimen. This instrumentation incorporated a specially built set of force trariducers to measure the time history of the interface force as the * Numbers in parentheses designate references at the end of the paper. 4.1224 0096-736X/89/9704-1 224$02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 1 Impactor Design 881719 impactor penetrateci the specimen. This tran- ducer array consisted of low mass semi- cylindrical discs backed up by piezoelectric load cells arranged such that for each one half inch of length along the face of the impactor a separate electronic force/ time history of the impact was generated, lhe data thus produced from each impact gave detailed force/time and force/displacement histories along the length of the impactor. This al- lowed detailed characterization of fracture by identifying key points on the force/time and force/deflection curves. Additional instrumentation was applied in these experiments to reinforce the force/time observations regarding fracture. An acoustic emissions system was employed to identify bursts of stress wave energy associated with fracture in specimens during impactor pene- tration. PROCEDURE CADAVER HEAD TESTS INSTRUMENTATION . An impactor capable of detecting fracture during the event was re- quired, since the best use of the cadaver material would require impacting each head with more than enough energy to cause sig- nificant fracture, lhe relatively large mass required for the impactor and the associated large distributed forces associated with fracture precluded the determination of frac- ture force from accelerometer data. Therefore, an impactor was designed and fabri- cated for this project (see Figure 1) . It ) OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO &lt;S~7 lp ' M Piezo-electric V / / I force tranducers Sj&amp;Lj l/ _ Steel rod Impacted Surface-^-^ yj Teflon spacer consisted of eighteen miniature force transducers with piezoelectric sensors mounted to solid aluminum blocks which were in turn mounted to a falling mass on a drop tower, lhe force transducers were made by sandwiching piezoelectric sensors between aluminum and steel plates, lhe forces were transmitted to the sensors by steel rods that connected to semi-cylindrical disks. As previously noted, eighteen semi-cylindrical disks lined up side by side created a semi-circular rod-shapped impactor 20 mm in diameter and 230 ram in length. The masses between the impacted specimen and the loadcells were kept lew (17.6 gm) in order to allow detection of fracture from the force/time curves. Before the cadaver tests, the impactor and other instrumentation were tested on other materials. First wood slats, then sheep heads were tested with very encouraging results. An additional medium of fracture detection was desired in order to substantiate what was being observed on the force/time histories. Acoustic emissions monitoring was selected as this additional method of detecting fracture. The basic theory behind the acoustic emissions technique is that fractures create sound or deflection waves, (such as when snapping a pencil or a match stick) . While not always in the human audible range, most brittle or semi-brittle materials emit acous- tic waves upon fracture. This technique has been used for several years in the composite- materials industry to detect microscopic fractures before macroscopic fractures occur (7) . It has also been used in some static bone testing (8, 9) . This technique was applied to obtain a secondary fracture indica- tion. (See Appendix #1 for further discussion of acoustic emissions.) The most troublesome problem encountered in applying acoustic emissions to dynamic bone FIGURE 2 Acoustic Emission Sensors and Wave Guides 4.1225</page><page sequence="3">testing was the application of the sensors to the impact specimen. Several methods were attempted in sheep head tests. It was dis- covered that a conical-shaped wave guide (Shown in Figure 2) glued to an acoustic emissions sensor gave good results. This sensor was attached to the specimen by making a very small incision in the skin and then wedging the wave guide into the flesh adjacent to the bone to be impacted. The instrumentation setup is shown in Figure 3. The drop tower was instrumented with the impactor described above, a poten- tiometer connected to a continuous loop cable, and a 100G string pot to measure displacement. All instrumentation on the drop tower was sampled digitally at a rate of 5K Hz through a TransEra MEAS 7000 shewn on the left side of Figure 3. Acoustic emissions were sampled digitally at 5 MHz by a Soltec SDA 2000 shewn FIGURE 3 Cadaver Head Test Setup 4.1226</page><page sequence="4">881719 on the right side of Figure 3. SPECIMEN PREPARATION. For each of the fifteen unembalmed cadaver heads, (eleven female ages 59 to 90 and four male ages 39 to 84) a detailed set of anthropomorphic measure- ments was taken, and a full facial plaster casting was made. The specimens were then mounted facing upwards in individualized molded-plaster foundations, with the Frankfort plane vertical and the frontal plane laterally level. TEST SEQUENCE. Two impacts per head were conducted to obtain the maximum amount of data per spec iman: one to the midface region, either maxilla or zygoma, followed by an impact to the frontal region. It was felt that an impact to the midface region would not affect significantly the structural integrity or the force and strength characteristics of the frontal region. While nothing has been found in the literature to substantiate this, the geometry of the skull is such that minimal support of the frontal bone is derived from the midface structure. Drop heights for the 14.5 kg impactor ranged from 460 to 915 millimeters for the fronted bone, and 305 to 610 millimeters for the maxillary and zygomatic regions. The impacted areas of the skull are shown in Figures 4a and 4b. FIGURE 4 (a) Frontal/Zygoma Impact Location (Numbers identify the different force tranducers on the impacte - ) FIGURE 4(b) Frontal/Maxilla Impact Location (Numbers identify the different force tranducers on the impactor.) For frontal bone impacts, the impactor center line was set to strike the specimen approximately twenty millimeters above the supraorbital ridge. Impacts to the zygoma were centered on a line approximately ten millimeters below the suborbital ridge, which also impacted the nasal bone. Impacts to the maxilla were centered approximately ten milli- meters below the tip of the nose. HYBRID III TESTS INSTRUMENTATION . Instrumentation used for the facial impact tests cäi the Hybrid III dummy was the same as that used for the cadaver head impacts as described above (see Figure 5) . The only significant difference being that for the Hybrid III facial impacts no acoustic emission instrumentation was used. HYBRID III HEAD PREPARATION . A standard, unmodified Hybrid III ATD skull was used with the rubber skin in place, lhe skull cap was removed and the skull with the facial skin in place was then mounted to a steel support plate. 4.1227</page><page sequence="5">FIGURE 5 Hybrid III Test Setup TEST SEQUENCE. Impacts to the Hybrid III face were conducted at locations that corre- sponded to the impacts in the cadaver tests, i.e. the frontal, zygomatic, and maxillary regions. Drop heights used were 915, 760, 610 and 460 millimeters for the frontal zone, and 760, 610 and 460 millimeters for the zygomatic and maxillary zones. RESUITS CADAVER TESTS FRACTURE DETECTION. From the data col- lected during the cadaver facial impact test series, force/time, force/displacement, and acoustic emission/time curves were generated. During the test series only the central eight force transducers of the impactor were contacted. To generate the force/time curve for any one impact, the output data from each of the eight transducers was summed and the resultant was plotted against time. Figure 6 shows a typical force/time trace. The specimen used to generate the data in Figure 6 was from a sixty-eight year old female im- pacted in the maxillary region. The force/time history indicates a relatively gradual increase in force, and a slope which is nearly linear for approximately four mil- liseconds, followed by a very abrupt discontinuity in slope. This discontinuity indicates the initiation of significant frac- ture. Similar histories for each of the FORCE/TIME - 2289 MAXILLA (F-68) : [ ¡ ¡ ļ ¡ ^ [ ¡ [ 0 --s 0. ^-iooo.

The force/time history for each of the impacts was cross plotted with its displace- ment/time history to generate force/ displacement curves. The force/displacement curve generated with the data from Figure 6 is shown in Figure 7. This figure shows an increasing stiffness from zero to one cm, followed by a portion (from 1.0 to 1.5 cm) where the slope is approximately linear. At 1.5 cm, there is a very abrupt change in the slope of the curve. This change indicates that the nature of the impacted structure had been altered, probably because of a signifi- cant fracture of the bone in the impacted area. If a homogeneous material were impacted without incurring fracture, Hooke's law would dictate that the maximum force would occur at the point of maximum penetration. While the human face is certainly not a Hookian struc- ture, it is not unreasonable to expect a similar maximum force at the maximum point of penetration in the absence of bone fracture. The force/displacement curve shown in Figure 7 clearly shows substantial impactor travel (over 3 cm) after the maximum force is reached. Coupled with the fact that the slope discontinuities on the force/time and force/ displacement curves occurred at the same force levels, the sudden drop in stiffness supports the conclusion that fracture occurred at the discontinuity (at 26 milliseconds) shown in Figure 6. Another factor that supports this conclusion is the output from the acoustic emission sensors. As was indicated previously, acoustic emission data are a measure of the fracture noise or energy associated with an event. The instrumentation used in this test series gave an indication of the frequency and intensity of the acoustic emissions associated with each iirpact. Figure 8 is a trace of the acoustic emissions for the maxillary iirpact depicted in Figures 6 and 7. The solid line in Figure 8 marked with an "X" below it indicates a time of 20.56 msec. Prior to this point in time there were virtu- ally no detectable acoustic emissions. After this point and up to the time marked by the dashed line with an "O" below it at 26.43 msec, some relatively lew level emissions were detected. However, at about 26 msec a large burst of acoustic emissions is observed. These emissions occurred at essentially the same time as the discontinuity on the force/time curve in Figure 6, and was ap- parently caused by a major fracture of the maxilla. These two independent indicators of fracture are plotted on one graph in Figure 9. Comparing the two together yields an easily discernable point in time at which fracture occurred. Once the time at which fracture took place was determined, the fracture force level was readily obtained from the force/time curve.

The force/ displacement curves for the frontal impacts are shown in Figure 10. These curves were clipped at the point where fracture occurred in order to make the figure less confusing. The curves are approximately linear from the point of contact until the point of fracture. ZYGOMATIC IMPACT. Figure 11 shows force/displacement curves for each of the zygomatic impacts. A different trend is observed as compared to the frontal bone impacts. For all but one of the impacts a two-step linear curve is seen. Initially there is slope of about 10 newtons per mil- limeter. This is the area where the nasal bone is being loaded and fractured. This was determined by analyzing the force/ displace- ment curves for each of the eight force 4.1230</page><page sequence="8">881719 FORCE/DISPLACEMENT - FRONTAL 0. - 1 - ' k 1 - 1 1 ' 1 - - ; 0. -2000.

The iinpactor was centered on the head so that the center transducers contacted the nasal bone. The center transducers were contacted five to ten millimeters before any of the other sensors. After this initial contact, loading of the other more distal sensors indicated force readings as the impac- tor penetrated into the zygomatic region. At this point the slope on the force/displacement curve changes to yield the second, ap- proximately linear segment with an average stiffness of 150 newtons per millimeter. One force/displacement history deviated significantly from the description above. In this case, the force rose very quickly after initial contact with the impactor rather than rising slowly for the first five to ten mil- limeters. Upon examining the force/displacement histories of the individual force transducers for this impact, it was found that the center two sensors were the only ones loaded for the first 15 millimeters of impactor penetration. This indicated a nasal bone that was larger and significantly tougher than the rest of those in the test series. MAYTT J ary IMPACT. The force/displacement histories for the maxillary impacts are shown in Figure 12. Five of the six histories shown are very similar, and exhibit a characteristic stiffness about the same as that of the zygcma. There is a relatively flat portion for about five millimeters followed by a change in slope indicating increasing stiff- ness. As with the zygomatic impacts, the center force transducers were loaded first, followed by the outer ones. This was expected because of the curvature of the surface being impacted. The one curve that deviated sub- stantially from the others was that of an 84 year old male. This specimen seemed to be much tougher than the rest. In the frontal bone impact of this specimen, only a hairline fracture was observed. Whereas, in all of the other specimens, very severe fractures oc- curred. It is felt that this variation in bone structure accounted for the shorter rise time and steeper siepe for this impact. FRACTURE t.fvftk and STIFFNESS. There is a fairly large spread in fracture forces and stiffness for each of the impact zones. The fracture-force level and stiffness for each of the impacts are listed in Table 1. Fracture force for frontal bone impacts ranged from 2200 N to 6500 N with stiffness ranging from 400 N/mm to 2200 N/mm. In the zygomatic region fracture forces varied from 900 to 2400 N, while stiffness ranged from 90 to 230 N/mm. Fracture forces of the maxilla varied from 1000 to 1800 N, with stiffness of 80 to 250 N/mm. While there is a large variation in the data, they are consistent with that seen in other facial impact research. Additionally, the fracture forces are consistent with those previously observed (2, 3, 10) even though the impact loading configuration, impactor shape and head support are significantly different.

As previously noted, the test setup and instrumentation for the Hybrid III tests were the same as that used for the cadaver head tests, with the exception of the head mount and the lack of acoustic emission sensors. The force/time curves for the frontal, zygomatic and maxillary zones were very similar (see Figure 13) . Each of the curves shewn in Figure 13 were the result of a 460 millimeter drop. The maximum force reached for each region is also about the same, as is the shape of the curve. The force/displace- ment curves are also quite similar. However, there are some interesting differences that should be pointed out. FRONTAL IMPACT. Figure 14 shows the force/displacement history for a 460 mm drop into the frontal region of the Hybrid III head. The curve shows a short 3 mm portion with one slope, and then a change in slope to a much steeper region from about 3 to 13 mm The first slope occurs while the rubber skin is being compressed. After this compression a steeper slope is encountered while deflection of the aluminum skull takes place. ZYGOMATIC IMPACT. The zygomatic region exhibited similar behavior in the lower por- tion of the curve. However, the beginning of the curve is distinctly different. Figure 15 shews compression for nearly 20 mm at very low force levels. This corresponds to crushing of the hollow rubber nose structure molded into the skin. As soon as this structure is flat- tened, the behavior becomes very stiff, much like the frontal region. 4.1233</page><page sequence="11">FORCE/TIME - HYBRID III (DROP HEIGHT: 18") 0. -&gt;J 5sõs= ■■■ 0. -2°°°. | j(&gt; : -500. g-4°00. - ļļ f[ : _1000 i u I ¡I _1000 m O -6000.

The stiffness of the maxillary zone, shewn in Figure 16, ultimately becomes very stiff like the frontal and zygomatic regions, however there is a rela- tively gradual transition from the soft to stiff portions instead of the abrupt increase in stiffness observed for the frontal and the zygomatic zones. This is most likely due to the thickness of the rubber skin at the maxi- llary zone, lhe skin in both the frontal and zygomatic regions is 0.5 inches thick while the skin covering the maxillary zone is 0.9 inches. This somewhat explains the difference observed between the maxillary and the zygomatic and frontal regions. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FRONTAL BONE. A comparison of the facial impacts of the human cadaver with those of the Hybrid III face is shewn in Figure 17. This figure shews the force/displacement histories of frontal bone impacts on the cadavers with solid lines, and that of the Hybrid III with a diagonally striped line. Compression of the rubber skin and the subsequent deflection of the aluminum skull are very discernable in the dummy data. While the compliance of the dummy frontal zone does not fall exactly in the middle of the cadaver data, it does come close. The similarity of the dummy and cadaver data indicates reasonable biofidelity of the Hybrid III dummy face in the frontal region. However, there are substantial dif- ferences for the zygomatic and maxillary regions. ZYGOMA. In Figure 18 the zygomatic impact of the Hybrid III dummy is again marked by a diagonally striped line, and the impacts into the cadavers are marked by solid lines with their average represented by the later- ally striped line. The distinct areas of compression for the Hybrid III dummy face are observed, each with increasing slope or stiff- ness. lhe first is the crushing of the hollcw rubber nose. The second is the compression of the rubber itself, and the third is the defor- mation of the aluminum skull. In comparison, the cadaver impacts exhibited only two dis- tinct areas of compression. The first was the loading and fracture of the nasal bone, and the second was the loading of the zygemas. In comparing the Hybrid III and the cadavers, the observation is made that the Hybrid III nasal/ zygomatic area is initially about equal to the cadavers in stiffness, but allows too much penetration relative to the cadaver data. The dummy then becomes much stiff er than all of the cadavers tested, having a stiffness of 100Ò N/mm. This is about seven times greater than the average stiffness of 150 N/mm for the cadavers in this region. MAXILLA.

The average for the cadaver impacts was plotted discount- ing the stiffest cadaver head for reasons described previously. As shown in the Figure 19, the Hybrid III dummy face is approximately six times stiff er than the cadavers in the maxillary region. Even when compared to only the very stiffest head, which seems to be out of line with the others, the Hybrid III maxi- llary region is still three times too stiff. Two things become obvious in comparing the stiffness of the Hybrid III face with that of cadavers. First, the frontal region ap- pears to have acceptable biofidelity as far as compliance is concerned. This should not be surprising, considering the fact that the Hybrid III head was designed based on cadaver frontal impact data (11). Secondly, the Hybrid III dummy head is many times stiffer in the midface region. Even though there is a significant amount of scatter in the stiffness data for the zygo- matic and maxillary regions of the human cadaver, the Hybrid III dummy face is at least three times stiffer than any cadaver head tested. This undoubtedly results in dummy- crash-test accelerations and forces that are artificially high, making correlation with biomedical research found in the literature nearly impossible. As observed in this test series, the midface iirpacts on the Hybrid III face resulted in forces of approximately 10,000 newtons, while the cadaver impacts averaged about 2000 newtons, and never exceed 3,500 newtons on any impact. CONCLUSIONS While recognizing the limitations of the small sample size employed in this research, the following conclusions and recommendations are indicated: 1) Average stiffness values for the human cadaver head in the frontal, zygomatic, and maxillary regions are approximately 1000, 150, and 120 newtons per millimeter respec- tively. 2) The Hybrid III face is several times stiffer in the midface region and should be redesigned if it is to yield accurate facial impact force and acceleration readings when used as an evaluation tool in automobile design. 3) Additional research is recommended to expand the sample base so that the quantita- tive conclusions listed can be refined.

As indicated in the literature, acoustic emissions is a proven method of bone fracture detection. It is particularly useful because bone is a complex structure of materials with widely differing properties. Furthermore, initiation of bone fracture is difficult to detect otherwise. Acoustic emission measuring techniques involve the detection and recording of perhaps thousands or millions of minute microfractures with their attendant releases of strain energy. ACOUSTIC EMISSIONS. The fibrous, cellular structure of bone produces a series of micro- fractures, each of which results in a pulse or stress waves because of the sudden release of strain energy associated with the micro- fracture. A major fracture will produce a succession of microfractures as each over- stressed microneighbor of a previous micro- fracture takes its turn being stressed to fracture. ACOUSTIC EMISSIONS MEASUREMENTS AND RECORDINGS . Acoustic emissions sensors are acoustically coupled to tissue in the vicinity of impact fracture. Means are provided to produce the desired acoustic coupling so that microfracture stress waves can be sensed by the acoustic emission detectprs. Means must also be provided to record the acoustic emis- sion data vs. time for correlation with other impact data such as force and displacement. The traditional acoustic emissions recording systems are too slow for the impact speeds involved in this study. Furthermore, the form of their partially reduced data did not correlate well to the impact fracture process. A high speed (5 MHz sampling rate) data acquisition system was found to be suit- able for recording acoustic emissions data. Exemplary experiments were performed by some of the authors on sheep heads (12) . These helped establish the desirable system characteristics for proper emissions detection and recording. Figures 8 and 9 show typical, graphical recordings of acoustic emissions with their corresponding impact-data curves. 4.1239</page><page sequence="17">Appendix #2 Complete Set of Force/Time Histories for Sensors 1-8 FORCE/TIME - 2289 MAXILLA (SENSOR 4) FORCE/TIME - 2289 MAXILLA (SENSOR 5) o. s 0. o. - - rrz: o. g -soo. : : -100' 2 z -500' : : "100' » 8 • V S y V -S o a ■ o O - -200. ct o - -200. ct -1000. ^ ^ -1000. w - -300. - -300. _1500 -1500. .00 .01 .02 .03 .04 .05 .06 .07 .08 .09 .10 .00 .01 .02 .03 .04 .05 .06 .07 .08 .09 .10 TIME (sec) TIME (sec) FORCE/TIME - 2289 MAXILLA (SENSOR 3) FORCE/TIME - 2289 MAXILLA (SENSOR 6) o o. o. ; o.
