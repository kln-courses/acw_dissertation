<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOLOGICAL PHILOLOGY.* THIS Book is an illustration of the remark "what great effects from trifling causes spring." Newton deduced large physical laws from the fall of an apple, and our author has arrived at many deductions of great importance, having started from the simple question &lt;" how did John and Jack become synonymous?" The progress from the starting point was made through the relations between other names of ancient origin and modern ideas. On finding that such cognomina as Elizabeth, Anna, Isabella, and others, date from a remote antiquity, Dr. Inman has investigated such ancient names as occur in the Bible and else- where, with an especial eye to the ideas which dictated their adoption. Our author shows that appellatives amongst the Shemitic nations were not hereditary; there is, for example, no " David the second," nor " Solomon the third," spoken of in the Scriptures. He tells us, too, that cognomina were given at birth, or shortly afterwards, whence he deduces the corollary that if a name is assigned to an historic per- sonage which describes his character, the reader must believe that the cognomen was invented by the historian who tells of the man, rather than given by authority when the individual was young. Thus, * Ancient Faiths embodied in Ancient Names; or, an Attempt to trace the Religious Belief, Sacred Rites, and Holy Emblems of certain Nations, by an in- terpretation of the names given to children by priestly authority, or assumed by prophets, kings, and hierarchs.

The author then states, on the authority of Rawlinson and other scholars, that names were in ancient times given by priests or oracles, and that these introduced into the cognomen the titles or attributes of the god or goddess who was the object of their worship. One remarkable illustration of this is an appellative found in a Babylonian inscription which signifies "Nebo gave the name." From this very important circumstance it follows that an investigation into the signi- fication of names is one of the means by which a knowledge can be attained of the names of ancient gocls, and the ideas associated with them and with their worship. Having thus laid the foundation for future remarks, the author goes on to show the strong probabilities which exist that the religious notions of the Shemites were largely cliffusecl along the shores of the Mediterranean, the maritime borders of Europe, ancl the British Isles, by means of traclers from Tyre ancl Carthage, whose naval enterprise and religious belief he compares with those of the Dutch, English, Americans, and Spaniards. The author then expresses his belief that the colonisation of Europe has been brought about by two distinct elements, the one being the Indo-Germanic race, who travelled wholly by land, the other the Phcenicians, who voyaged in ships. Whenever these two came into contact, he considers that a language was formed resembling the lingua franca now in use along the shores of the Mediterranean. In this it is certain that the tongue of the seafaring travellers woulcl preponderate, whilst inland there would be few words found which had been imported by sea. Hence the author accounts for the frequent appearance of Shemitic names on the European seaboard, and of the remains of Phoenician customs in her maritime provinces. Having then shown that there is strong probability for the belief that many current cognomina and names of localities are of very ancient origin, and that they were originally associated with the religious belief of the Shemitic races, the author then institutes an inquiry into the theology of the Assyrians and Babylonians. In doing this he assumes that the inquirer is at perfect liberty to illustrate the past by the present, for no one, he thinks can assert any antiquated form of religion to be too absurd to be possible, if it is shown that a faith of a corresponding character is held by one or more nations now existent. Before examining the religion of other people, the author takes a rapid review of that which obtains credence in Great Britain, and in few 2d 2</page><page sequence="3">380 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. words shows the nature of the glass house in which we ourselves live, thus showing the advisability of our not throwing stones at our neighbours too actively. Our author shows very strongly that the Roman Catholic form of christianity contains a large amount of paganism, and he frequently adopts papal doctrines, dogmas, and symbols as evidence of Babylonian religious tenets. When describing the ancient gods of Assyria, the author refers to the reverence with which the lingam and the yoni are held in Hindo- stan and Asia generally, and in this part, of the volume he enters into particulars which are not to be found in any other published English book?although such information is readily to be met with in France and Germany. The difficulties which beset the author when he entered upon this portion of his task are evident to the reader, for he finds that in some instances the English language is exchanged for the Latin. It is, under all circumstances, a very trying task to dress up what are considered indecencies in honest garb, and the labour is not the less difficult because the obscenities have been inseparably interwoven with what passes to this day as religion. It is this which has doubtless deterred our contemporaries from reviewing this very important book; yet we think that the interests of morality require that the subject referred to should be widely known. If, as the author propounds, the doctrine of the christian trinity be founded upon the fact that the organ which characterizes the male is composed of three distinct portions, which are, so to speak, " co-eternal together and co-equal "?three parts, but one thing?it is clear that few who know this would care to take part in the strife between Athanasians and Arians. To many it may seem to be an outrageous idea that such a trinity could ever be regarded with honour; yet that it was so is clear from the 23rd chapter of Deuteronomy, and the first verse, wherein we are distinctly told that any one in whom a portion of this triad was injured was to be excluded from " the communion of saints." Again, if, as the author asserts, the reverence in which the virgin is held by many at the present day, is nothing more than a relic of the worship of the yoni, or a counterpart of the impure cult of the Egyptian Isis, the Greek Ceres and Venus, and the Assyrian Ashtorath. If " Mary" is nothing more than a covert means of referring to the particular part which characterises woman, we cannot conceive that any one would fight for the supremacy of a priesthood professing to honour such a part; we conclude, therefore, that it is a duty, however disagreeable a one it may be, for all who profess to be religious teachers, to examine into the real foundation of the faiths current at the present day. Dr. Inman endeavours to lead his readers logically to the conclusions which we have indicated above. Quoting mainly</page><page sequence="4">INMAN ON THEOLOGICAL PHILOLOGY. 381 from Rawlinson he shows that the godhead amongst the Mesopotamians was a " quartette," which he considers to be equivalent to the Hebrew Arba ? a word signifying four ? and literally allied to erva, the meaning being " the pudenda" of both sexes. Of these four three are males and one is female. These are described as the creators of all things, an idea which is manifestly taken from a belief that the Almighty acts in Heaven as He has taught His creatures to do on earth. As no new being is formed in our world without a conjunction between the male triad and the female unit, a similar union is presumed to occur on high, and the author shows that amongst ancient, and some modern nations, the Almighty is described as androgynous. That this idea prevailed even amongst the Jews, as well as other Shemites, is shown by their use of such words as Elohim, Baalim, Ashtorath, which indicates a plurality or duality of individuals who speak and act as one. With the idea thus indicated the sun and moon were associated, the former to represent the male, the latter the female creator, and " the four" is still indicated in papal ancl other churches by the sun and moon in conjunction. The earth frequently replaces the moon in mythology. Dr. Inman then calls the reader's attention to the antiquity and signification of certain signs or symbols which are used as freely in christian churches as they are in pagan temples. He pays, moreover, special attention to the curious figure which is spoken of by Cuneatic scholars as the grove, and he demonstrates, we think, that it is a covert way of indicating the female sex, and analogous to the sistrum of Isis, vesica piscis, or the lozenge of the Virgin Mary. He concludes hence that the Mesopotamian religion acknowledged the superiority of the Mother of God, and he again calls attention to the close resemblance between the Babylonian and the papal religions ; into which Dr. Inman does not enter fully, as he wishes his readers to consult Hislop's able work entitled Nimrod v. the Papacy. In pursuing the subject of symbols, the author gives an illustration which proves that the "fleur-de-lys," once a venerated emblem in France, represents the male triad. To this he adds many others to show that the crux ansata, or handled cross, was an emblem of the union of the two sexes, just as the letter T was an emblem of the Almighty Father. The coronation orb placed in the hands of our own sovereigns, equally indicates the conjunction of the Trinity and the Virgin. After a long preface, extending over nearly 300 pages, and whose main features we have thus described, Dr. Inman has a short note, in which he indicates that the scope and intention of his work has been modified more than once by other investigators having taken up the subject, and published their conclusions, before he had advanced</page><page sequence="5">382 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. far towards the completion of his manuscript. Amongst the authors indicated, he mentions the Rev. J. S. Lysons, whose book on " our British Ancestors" he eulogises. After this comes what he calls a vocabulary, in which he gives an explanation of the signification of all Biblical proper names, which commences from A to J inclusive; the rest of the alphabet being reserved for the second volume. In this part of the work are introduced many dissertations on subjects which are of considerable theological importance. For example, there is an article upon Angels, in which the author attempts to show that the veiy notion of the existence of such beings is founded upon a degrading idea of the nature of the Almighty. He shows that the Creator of the Universe, who is omnipresent, cannot require any beings to go to a distance on His business ; that to suppose that He requires messengers is to place Him in the same category as an earthly monarch who sends ambassadors to other kingdoms than his own. This anthropomorphic notion is then traced from the Jews to the Bab3donians, and a perti- nent query is put whether the latter people can be regarded as heathens, pagans, or idolators, when it is found that articles of Jewish belief, which are to be founcl in our Bible, and so regarded as inspired truths, are drawn in reality from the priests of the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar. Attention is also drawn to the corollary which follows from the foregoing, viz., if the Jews drew their inspired beliefs from Babylonians, it is clear that the latter were the people of God, and the depositories of His revelations before the Jews were. Dr. Inman concludes this article by instituting a comparison between the Jewish and Christian belief in archangels and angels, and the Grseco- Roman faith in gods and demigods. In comparisons such as these he frequently indulges; and they almost always compel the thoughtful reader to lay down the volume, and submit his mind to a rigid cross- examination. The tu quoque style of argument so captivating to polemics, is here rigorously applied to those who think well of them? selves but despise others. In this he resembles a writer who remarks, " thou who sayest a man should not steal?dost thou steal, etc. 1" The book, indeed, is a continuous protest against the self-laudation of British religionists, and the senseless idea that the Almighty dicl favour the Jews, and now regards the Christians as his only legitimate offspring, to the exclusion of all the worlcl besides. In what way, asks our author in one part, can we fairly discriminate between Elohim and Jupiter, Juno and the Virgin Mary. The first is represented as loving Israel as a man loves his wife; as being jealous, furious, avengeful, planning a design, changing His mind, and then cheating Himself: e.g., He makes man, then determines to destroy everything living by a flood, ancl then contrives an ark by which his intention may be frustrated.</page><page sequence="6">INMAN ON TIIEOLOGICAL PHILOLOGY. 383 The Greeks never represented Zeus as doing such an absurdity as this. Again, we see Elohim, as three men, coming to visit Abraham; their special mission being to inquire personally into the character of Sodom and its neighbouring towns. These men eat and drink, and promise a son to an old man who entertains them. In like manner, Jupiter, as three men, go to visit another old and childless being, and give him hopes of offspring, even though he has no wife. The ancients gave no title to Juno which is not now given to the Virgin Mary. Another point in Dr. Inman's work which strikes our attention, is the impartial style with which he analyses the characters whom he draws. In all the theological works which we have read, we have always noticed that the method of criticism applied to Scripture wor- thies differs wholly from that applied to other people. Thus, Abraham being once called " the friend of God," and " the father of the faith- ful," is treated with a tenderness, and his failings are covered with a a gauze, which is never used with Budh, Julius Csesar, Alexander, or our own Queen Mary. David also being once styled the " sweet psalmist of Israel," is weigh ed in a very different balance from Ahab and Jezebel. In no instance does our author allow himself more than one standard, that of morality, justice, or right. Led by this, the accounts which he gives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Daniel, and others, are as unsparing as if he were giving a biography of Alcibiades, Norman William, Mary Tudor, Napoleon, Fra Diavolo of Naples, and Jack Sheppard of England. In his description, for example, of Jeremiah and the doctrines enunciated in the writings which pass by his name, Dr. Inman points out the utter absurdity which pervades them,?his remarks may be summed up thus : Jeremiah preaches to the Jews that all their miseries come from God in punishment for their sins: that if the people repent, victoiy, power, and plenty shall return to them. In other words, that prosperity is a mark of God's favour and adversity of His displeasure. If this doctrine be true it must follow that the enemies of Jerusalem were the friends of Jehovah, and that one on whom his displeasure rested, and who was consequently a bad man, was "the man Christ Jesus." From the same assertion we infer that the early Mahometans were clearer to God than were the Christians. Amongst the essays which have arrested our attention very forcibly, are two upon Heaven and Hell. In the first of these the author remarks that the idea of future rewards and punishments did not obtain amongst the Jews, who borrowed it from the Persians and others; consequently it follows that our notions being founded upon sources wholly pagan, must either be valueless, or, if valuable, they must prove that heathens (so-called) are not pagans. Considerable</page><page sequence="7">384 ANTHROPOLOGICAL REVIEW. stress is then laid upon the description given of Heaven bj' divines, each filling it with the delights which the inventor most coveted? thus Mahomet makes the abode of bliss a spot where sensual pleasure is unbounded and eternal. The music-loving and covetous Jew peoples it with harpers and singers, golden palaces and jewelled dresses ; whilst the Christian makes one of the delights of his heaven the power of watching throughout eternity the tortures of those who opposed him during " time." We have also been very greatly struck by the forcible manner in which Dr. Inman occasionally enunciates a broad truth ; for example, he makes the remark that the Bible positively paints God and the Devil as the same individual, and he illustrates his meaning by re- ferring to the pillar which intervened between the Egyptians and the Jews, and which was darkness to the one and light to the other. Just so the God who enabled David, Joshua, ancl others to ravage, ravish, and torture their enemies, was to those enemies a demon of destruction. What indeed is even the christian idea of the Almighty but of one who is loving to His friends, but who " plays the very devil" with His adversaries. In the article on Hell, Dr. Inman has a passage which we here reproduce :? " These thoughts lead us onwards to the consideration of the future condition of animals in general. It is quite as reasonable to conclude that horses and rats have a future existence as that worms have. We are told that in hell there is a worm that never dies; we find too that the prophet Zechariah is a witness to an angelic vision, wherein a man is seen riding upon a red horse, which was followed by other horses that were red, speckled, or bay, and white; and Zechariah is told by the Angel these were sent by the Lord to walk to and fro throughout the earth (chap. i, 8-11). We find additional evidence that horses exist in heaven from the Apocalypse of St. John, wherein the angel declares that w he saw and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow " (chap. vi., 2). In other places he speaks of a red, a black, and a pale horse (chap. vi., 4-8). Now it is perfectly clear that if John really saw what he says that he did see, horses must exist in heaven, and if so it is quite as reasonable to conclude that they came from earth as that they were created in the sky. It is equally certain that in the mediseval representations of hell there were numberless animals introduced whose business was to torture disembodied spirits, which the skill of Romish artists represented as material. There is not a single argument in Butler's A nalogy of Religion which does not apply as forcibty to all the lower animals as it does to mankind. The Indian peoples his future paradise with horses and dogs?the Christian adorns his heaven with golden harps and rivers of pure crystal, and the one idea is just as reasonable as the other. " Nowr let us for a moment allow that there is a future for lions and</page><page sequence="8">INMAN ON THEOLOGICAL PHILOLOGY. 385 lambs, tigers and oxen, wolves and sheep, horses and dogs, we then have to examine the question, Do the vicious horses and dogs go to hell, and those who take to training kindly go to heaven ? Do the s]3aniels and the domesticated dogs go to the good place, and the curs and savage mongrels to the bad ? Or can one dog who has been vexed with another send him to the bad, whilst he himself takes to the good quarter 1 Can the murdered ox or sheep send the fierce lion or tiger to hell and go itself to heaven 1 To put these questions is to answer them; can we assign any greater power to man that is a worm ]" pp. 577. There is a still stronger blow dealt to the current Roman and Anglican doctrines respecting hell, in a note on pages 562-3, in which Dr. Inman denounces that odium theologicum, the indulgence of which forms an element in the christian's idea of heaven?the idea that hell is made to enable divines to indulge in an eternal revenge is indeed awful. This quotation will give to the reader an idea of the author's way of handling his subject. He does not so much dogmatise as suggest; he does not assert nor does he flatly deny, but he puts a question in such a. manner as to do all this. He nowhere asserts the unreality of heaven or hell, but he insinuates that no man, nor any body of men, has any power to send a fellow-being either to the one place or to the other?he denies that man has any influence whatever in the unseen world. To remove such assumed power from human creatures Dr. Inman appears to consider as a part of his mission in life; he clearly has no sympathy with those hierarchs who are perpetually saying in language of greater or lesser delicacy, "you go to hell" to each who differ from them. In an article on " Inspiration" the author thus speaks of such men and of the book on whose authority they indulge their cruel dispositions :? "But it must still further be noticed that one of the necessary accompaniments of insufficient education in the leaders of religious thought, is the constant tendency in the interpretation of the " Word," which is said to be inspired, to lean to the animal propensities of men rather than to appeal to their better aspirations. Some preachers desire to be real Boanerges, or sons of Thunder, and rouse the passions of their hearers by flaunting before them the zeal of Moses, who ordered the murder of some thousands of his followers when being of heresy they thought more of a figure than of the unseen God .... Others of a more revengeful disposition quote authoritatively such passages as " Happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us." (Ps. cxxxvii., 8, 9),?and after two pages of illustration of this style of pulpit orators Dr. Inman remarks?" Surely when we find that the Bible lends itself so readily to the justification of murder in a religious cause, and adultery as a sacred emblem, ancl when we find that it contains a selection of such abusive terms as deserve the modern name</page><page sequence="9">386 anthropological review. of 'Billingsgate,' it is justifiable for us to consider itto be the word of man rather than the inspired outpourings of the Almighty." This is a matter of opinion. It is beyond our province or that of Dr. Inman to make such a generalisation. We think we have now said sufficient to give our readers some idea of the scope and object of this most impoi-tant and interesting work. We know of no modern work which is more interesting to the student of historical anthro? pology than the one now before us. Dr. Inman is one of the men of the time, or perhaps more correctly, one of the men of the future. His work we commend to the attention of the students of theological and philological mythology. Having examined the names explained in the vocabulary, we find that they may be thus classified. Those which refer to God as the almighty, inscrutable, omniscient, and omnipotent; those which refer to the sun as His minister; those which refer to the moon; to the heavens; to the planets ; those which refer to the lingam chiefly ; those which refer to the yoni; those which evidence an adoration of El; of Jah ; of Shaddai; of Adonai; of Baal; of Bel, Asher, Gad (the Phoenician Venus), Astarte, and a variety of other names given to the Supreme. We must also notice an important note in which Dr. Inman, (on the authority of the Rev. Dr. Ginsburg, whose dictum on this subject carries overwhelming weight,) states that the Jews, in comparatively modern times, have intentionally altered the text of their Scriptures with the definite intention to make what is called the sacred record and the inspired word of God square with Hebrew ideas. In this the ancient " people of God" resemble the moderns, who assume the powTer of suppressing or altering the sense of any passage which they dislike. The God who changes not is thus declared to have two mincls?the one announced in the Old, the other in the New Testament. The first is in reality regarded as the result of " His prentice hand," the second of His maturer judgment.</page></plain_text>
