Revised March 2015) ABSTRACT Southern Africa has provided much information concerning the cultural, technological and cognitive evolution o/Homo sapiens. ^4s indications of cognitive complexity that become prevalent during the Middle Stone Age, abstract and figurative art present explicit evidence for modern and symbolic human behavioural capacity. The only examples of African figurative art securely dated to the Late Pleisto cene comprise seven stone plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in the Huns Mountains, Karas region, Namibia. These were recovered by Wendt in 1969 and 1972 from levels dated to c. 30 OOO years ago. Given the cultural and evolutionary significance of these artefacts, the objective of this report is to make available high resolution actual-size colour and digitally enhanced photographs of these unique examples of early art mobilier. Chemical analysis of the plaques and the pigments that compose the imagery is ongoing and will bepresented in a forthcoming publication. INTRODUCTION Abstract and figurative art present widely recognised mediums for assessing the evolution of human cognitive modernity (Henshilwood &amp; d'Errico 2011). Figurative depic tions explicate the artist's deepest subconscious state of mind (Thomas &amp; Silk 1990) while visually organising a shared culture through exchanging information (Cox et al. 2001). For decades, the earliest known parietal figurative art comprised painted and drawn images from Chauvet Cave, France, at 32.44 ± 0.720 ka (Clottes &amp; Geneste 2012). The publication of Uranium series (U-series) dates for calcites underlying a red painted anthropomorph from Tito Bustillo, Spain, at 36.2 ±1.5 ka, extended the age of European figurative art by millennia (Pike et al. 2012). The earliest abstract parietal art is a painted red disk at El Castillo, Spain, dated by U-series to 41.4 ± 0.57 ka. This places parietal art in the Proto-Aurignacian, a period associated with Neanderthals, preceding the arrival of Homo sapiens in western Europe. In Indonesia, the U-series dating of speleo thems overlying a human hand stencil at Leang Timpuseng provided a minimum age of 40.70 ± 0.86 ka for the image and a date of 36.90 ± 1.55 ka for a babirusa (pig-deer) from Leang Barugayya 2 (Aubert et al. 2014). The earliest ages for South Afri can parietal art are for human figures painted on exfoliated slabs from Steenbokfontein Cave, dated by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on associated charcoal in the deposit to 3640 ± 60 BP (PTA-6805) to 3635 ± 30 BP (PTA-7020) (Jerardino &amp; Swanepoel 1999). AMS dating on carbon-based pigments on flakes from a painted panel in the Drakensberg indicates ages of between 2100 ± 40 and 2072 ± 28 years BP (Bonneau et al. 2011). Some of the earliest examples of portable forms of art com prise the figurines from Tan Tan in Morocco, associated with a fluvial deposit with middle Acheulian lithics of —300-500 ka (Bednarik 2003), and from Berekhat Ram, Israel, dated to 250-280 BP using the Argon-argon (Ar^/Ar39) method (Feraud et al. 1983; d'Errico &amp; Nowell 2000). Art mobilier has also been recovered from European Palaeolithic contexts, including a carved ivory figurine from Hohle Fels, Germany, at 35 ka (Conard 2009), ceramic figurines from the Czech Republic at 31 ka (Soffer et al. 2000), painted plaques from Parpallö Cave, Spain, at 26 ka (Roldân et al. 2012) and an engraved figurine from Predemosti, Czech Republic, dated to 26 ka (d'Errico et al. 2011). Portable art is also reported from Australia, with the most recent example being a painted stone slab from Nawarla Gabarnmang dated to 28 ka (David et al. 2012). Ages for southern African portable abstract art range from —500 ka (Beaumont &amp; Vogel 2008) to 187 ka (Jacobson et al. 2012) and as recently as AD 1800 (Morris &amp; Beaumont 1994). Early examples comprise engraved ochre from Pinnacle Point dated to 164 ka (Marean et al. 2007), Klasies River at 100 ka (d'Errico et al. 2012), Blombos Cave dated to 100-72 ka (Henshilwood et al. 2002, 2009) and from Klein Kliphuis at 50 ka (Mackay &amp; Welz 2008). Engraved ostrich eggshell fragments have been recovered from Diepkloof Rock Shelter (Texier et al. 2013), Klipdrift Shelter (Henshilwood et al. 2014) and Apollo 11 (Vogelsang et al. 2010) in levels dated to between —85 and 52 ka. At Blombos, two bone fragments dated to —75-72 ka, exhibit possible engravings (d'Errico et al. 2001). An MSA bone point from Peers Cave bears markings reminiscent of those used as marks of ownership on San arrow points, and an MSA bone tool from Klasies River bears possible deliberate engravings (d'Errico &amp; Henshilwood 2007). Given the evidence that fully modern human behaviour originated in sub-Saharan Africa (Henshilwood et al. 2009, 2011; Lombard 2011, 2012), the Middle and Late Pleistocene ages (MIS 6 at 190 ka to MIS 3 at 60 ka) reported for art mobilier are not unusual. The final abstract mobiliary art occurs during the terminal phases of the MSA Howiesons Poort (HP) at —50 ka. Following a hiatus of some 20 ka for all types of southern African art, seven stone plaques, four of which bear figurative imagery, were recovered during excavations at Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia. These are currently the earliest examples of African representational art, dated by radiocarbon and optically stimu lated luminescence (OSL) methods to —30 ka (Wendt 1972, 1974,1976; Jacobs et al. 2008; Vogelsang et al. 2010). No coexis tent examples have been discovered, and figurative art mobilier only reappears after the Last Glacial Maximum to become a recurring feature in Later Stone Age (LSA) contexts (Thackeray et al. 1981; Morris &amp; Beaumont 1994; Pearce 2010). APOLLO 11 CAVE Apollo 11 Cave was first described by Wendt (1972,1974) in the early 1970s.

Scherz and Mr Koortzen, and (c) a map of southern Africa indicating the location of Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia. along the upper Nuob River in the Huns Mountains, Karas region, southern Namibia. The cave was discovered based on directions to engraved rock art sites provided by E.R. Scherz and a Mr Koortzen, the former owner of the farm Uitsig on which the cave was situated (W. Erich Wendt, pers. comm. 2014). Before its discovery, the name Goachanas, which refers to a spring located 2 km from the site, was used to refer to the valley below the cave. Captivated by the radio coverage of the Apollo 11 spacecraft mission which returned to earth in July 1969, Wendt decided to name the site after the first successful lunar landing (W. Erich Wendt, pers. comm. 2014) (Fig. 1). Wendt commenced excavations at Apollo 11 in 1969. The deposits were excavated in spits of between 5 and 20 cm, or stratigraphically where possible (Wendt 1974). Trench A was excavated in 1969 and includes eleven 1 m2 squares labelled A12 to A2. Four of the plaques, here referred to as API, AP3, AP4 and AP5, were recovered from square A9 in August 1969. In 1972, two extensions in square A9 (A9X1 and A9X2) were exca vated to clarify stratigraphie concerns and to establish the posi tions of the plaques recovered in 1969. In addition to the first four plaques, three further plaques (AP2, AP6 and AP7), one fitting to a fragment from the excavation in August 1969, were recovered in October 1972 (Wendt 1974,1976) (Table 1). The stratigraphie sequence of the site is divided into five major units labelled 0 to IV, including several sub-units labelled A to H (Wendt 1974). In 2007, Vogelsang and colleagues (2010) divided the sequence into 24 units labelled A to Z. Unit L is an early Later Stone Age (ELSA) deposit characterised by the occurrence of white ash with fine-grained limestone rubble. Unit M is a dusty brown sediment interspersed with finely laminated grit layers, indicating continuous weathering of the roof of the cave (Vogelsang et al. 2010). Unit M corresponds with Layer E (Wendt 1974) and is described by Wendt (1976: 7) as follows: The uppermost horizon contains blades assigned to the MSA. This layer has an average thickness of 30 cm, stretches over more than 20 ka and ought to consist of several distinct horizons. But owing to the relative scarcity of artefacts in general and of typical tools in particular throughout this layer, no marked differences within this unit are obvious at the present stage of artefact analysis. Fragments of several painted slabs and a small pebble bearing traces of paint have been recovered from a concentration in the uppermost horizon of this layer. One edge-damaged blade bearing traces of mastic around the basal third of its length is worth mentioning. Whereas the underlying Unit N comprises a rock-fall horizon that separates the HP from the final MSA, Unit P corre sponds to the HP cultural phase and Unit S marks a hiatus between the HP and the Still Bay (SB). Unit T is characterised by an increase of angular debris and corresponds to the SB cultural phase (Vogelsang et al. 2010). The art mobilier was recovered from the uppermost horizon of Layer E (Unit M), at the interface between the latest MSA and the earliest LSA levels. Radiocarbon ages of —8-26 ka were originally reported for these levels (Wendt 1974, 1976), with four dates (PTA-1040, KN-I 813, KN-2056 and KN-2115), indicating a mean age of 28.5 ± 0.59 ka for the deposits surrounding the plaques (Wendt 1974, 1976). In 2007, a team from the University of Cologne collected eight OSL samples (Jacobs et al. 2008) and subjected 44 samples from the original excavations to AMS dating (Vogelsang et al. 2010). Eight of the nine age estimates for the late MSA were considerably older than those associated with the earliest LSA. The lower LSA has</page><page sequence="3">South African Archaeological Bulletin 70 (201): 113-123,2015 115 TABLE 1. Inventory of the seven stone plaques recovered from Apollo 11 in 1969 and 1972.

An AMS date of 29.0 ± 0.4 BP (KIA-35917) and an OSL age of 29.4 ± 1.4 ka were obtained for the same deposits (Jacobs et al. 2008; Vogelsang et al. 2010). Given these dates, and the fact that the uppermost MSA has a weighted mean age of 29.8 ± 1.1 BP (Vogelsang et al. 2010), we consider the plaques to be reliably dated to —30 ka. ART MOBILIER Permission to analyse the plaques was granted by the National Heritage Council of Namibia and the National Museum of Namibia (permit number 25/2013) and took place in March 2014. Our descriptions of the plaques are based on those provided by Wendt (1974, 1976) and on information obtained during a meeting with him in Windhoek on 15 March 2014. Based on observations under low magnification, we consider the original figure captions and descriptions (Wendt 1974,1976) to be accurate. The plaques are numbered according to the order ascribed by Wendt (1974) (Figs 2-7). Because the plaques have been glued onto wooden panels and covered in glass casings, their posterior sections could not be examined. Storage conditions have also resulted in the accretion of dust particles and of fungiform activity on the stones. Prior to visual analyses and photographic documenta tion, dust particles were dislodged with gentle air pressure. No attempts were made to remove other materials from their surfaces. The plaques were photographed with a 16.2 MP Nikon D4 digital SLR camera fitted with a Nikon 60 mm AF-S Micro Nikkor lens. A Nikon R1C1 Wireless Speedlight System was used as the primary light source and two Nikon SB-900 AF flash units provided diffused light. All photographs were taken in raw (NEF) format at ISO 200 and f-stop 14. Each plaque was documented by way of: 1) single-exposure photographs, and 2) multiple overlapping shots at close range (—5 cm) and in rela tion to a photographic grid system. The photo-mosaic images (NEF-files) were imported into Nikon Camera Raw 8.6 and their exposure, white balance, sharpness and contrast settings adjusted. Geometric lens distortion was corrected with the Lens Profile correction utility and the final photographs were exported as uncompressed RGB TIFF files. The images were reduced to their actual sizes using the Adobe Photoshop image resampling tool and by applying the Bicubic Sharper interpola tion mode. Images were prepared for printing by re-sharpening (using Unsharp mask), adjusting their contrast (using Levels) and by converting the digital format from RGB TIFF (600 dpi) to CMYK JPEG (600 dpi). The mosaic images were digitally enhanced with DStretch®, a programme that employs a decorrelation stretch algorithm to enhance images by increas ing hue and contrast and by rendering these in artificial colours (Harman 2008). Colour rendering in the enhanced versions is not realistic and colour rendering in the original versions may vary according to printing technology and screen resolution. Wendt (1974: 27) originally referred to the image on API and AP2 (Fig. 2) as a depiction of a raubkatze or feline or, given the two hornlike features emanating from the top of the head, an oryx antelope (Oryx gazella). Pigments comprise mainly black and grey types, but traces of orange and red colours also exist. AP3 (Fig. 3) and AP6 (Fig. 6) contain partial depictions that presumably represent zebra (Equus zebra) (Wendt 1974: 28, 31). Resembling the black lines on AP3, the lines comprising the nashorn (Wendt 1974: 29) or black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) on AP4 (Fig. 4) appear to have been drawn over a translucent white pigment, possibly applied in liquid form. Wendt (1974: 30) noted the presence of a schwarzen tierkörpers (black animal body) and a springender bock or springbuck (Antidorcas marsupialis) antelope on AP5 (Fig. 5). We cannot discern an obvious figurative depiction, but the plaque does contain various superimposed traces of black, grey, white, orange and red pigments. AP7 (Fig. 7) comprise a nicht eindurig erkennbaren (Wendt 1974: 32) or unrecognisable' depiction, and traces of black, white, orange and red pigments and several semicircular remnants of what may represent dried-out traces of liquid paint drops, are discernible.</page><page sequence="4">116 South African Archaeological Bulletin 70 (201): 113-123,2015 FIG. 2.

AP3 is a fragment of a formerly larger stone slab and contains a partial depiction that conceivably represents 'zebra'. x0.75 DISCUSSION The Apollo 11 art mobilier derives from a confined anthropogenic horizon that marks the transition between the MSA and LSA and which has been dated to —30 ka. We concur with Wendt's (1976) statement that the plaques are not exfoli ated portions of an originally larger parietal panel. Besides the different geological origins of the plaques, the central position of the depictions on three plaques (API and 2, AP3 and AP4) and the concentration of these in only 1.5 m2 (Wendt 1974) support this inference. Associated artefacts comprise a pebble bearing traces of pigment, an edge-damaged blade with traces of mastic (Wendt 1976) and 45 pieces of shale-derived ochre and haematite. Visible traces of charcoal occur on AP2, AP3 and AP6, most generally in the form of 'drawn lines'. Traces of red ochre or haematite occur on AP4 and AP7 and traces of grey shale on AP5. A single deep engraved line occurs on AP3 and may have been created prior to the application of pigments. Some plaques (AP3, AP4 and AP6) contain traces of a flakey, white translucent substance which may be the remains of a white pigment or a preparatory base. San artists possibly prepared rock surfaces for painting by washing with acidic liquids such as plant or fruit juice (Bonneau et al. 2012). Instances of superimposition are clear on AP2, AP3, AP4, AP5 and AP6 and indications that parts of original images were redrawn occur on AP2 and AP3. Substantial amounts of prehensile polish are present on the edges of AP4 and AP7. Black residues and reddish discolouration on API, AP5 and AP4 suggest that some plaques may have been heated. Whether this was deliberate is unclear, but it appears to have resulted in the thermally induced fracturing and discolour ation of some plaques. Indications of edge flaking on API and AP2, AP4 and AP7 suggest that the plaques may originally have been shaped by deliberate knapping. In contrast to AP2, the adjoining API exhibits numerous percussion marks, indicating that the plaque was repeatedly struck after the image was created. In the case of AP6, scars along the edges indicate that areas formerly covered in pigment were removed by systematic flaking. Some of the plaques also bear residual traces of former liquid and possibly paint-like mixtures. The occurrence of a residue rich in red and black particles on AP6 suggests that it may have been used as a palette on which to mix pigmentatious ingredients. Several semicircular traces of what possibly repre sent dehydrated paint drops are also distinguishable on AP7. Resembling the Hohlenstein-Stadel therianthropic figurine (Wynn et al. 2009; Porr 2010), the Apollo 11 plaques provide much inspiration for discussions concerning prehistoric symbolism and ideology. Based on the perceived combination of animal and human physical characteristics, an attribute widely associated with shamanistic cosmology (Lewis-Williams 1981), several authors have referred to the depiction on API and AP2 as therianthropic (Lewis-Williams 1984; Jolly 2002). Depictions of therianthropes in southern African San rock art have been interpreted as humans disguised as animals (Lee &amp; Woodhouse 1970; Thackeray 1983), as portrayals of spirits-of the-dead' (Vinnicombe 1976; Blundell 2004) and as 'people of</page><page sequence="6">118 South African Archaeological Bulletin 70 (201): 113-123,2015 Sl- ' • 1 ■ "wbmw..

Reminiscent of the engraved zebra from Wonderwerk Cave (Thackeray et al. 1981), the percussion marks on API might be interpreted in terms of 'sympathetic hunting magic', the belief in securing success in a prospective hunt or control over an animal through ritually 'wounding' an image (Thackeray 2005). As the primary inter pretation of therianthropes relates to shamans and their expe riences of altered states of consciousness (Lewis-Williams 2006), the presence of a therianthrope on API and AP2 has been construed as reminiscent of the ability to induce, experience and communicate altered states of consciousness. It is probable that a degree of ideological and cosmological continuity exists between the MSA and the LSA (Lewis-Williams 1985). The analyses of artefacts produced by the early LSA inhabitants of Border Cave places the emergence of modern hunter-gatherer adaptation at 44 ka (d'Errico et al. 2012), supporting the notion that technological and cultural continuities exist between the MSA and the LSA. CONCLUSION The Apollo 11 plaques represent the earliest figurative art in Africa and correspond temporally with examples in Europe (Conard 2009; d'Errico et al. 2011; Roldân et al. 2012) and Australia (David et al. 2012). The seemingly concurrent appearance of these examples in Africa, Europe and Australia is thought provoking, perhaps signifying that the production of figurative art mobilier may not have a single geographic or cultural origin (d'Errico et al. 2012). Current evidence points to figurative art first appearing in various regions at different times, but the earliest known occurrence does not predate —35 ka. Similarly, no unequivocal personal ornaments reliably dated to between 70 ka and 40 ka are known, and it is only after —40 ka that they reappear in Africa and the Middle East, and for the first time in Europe, Siberia and Australia (Ambrose 1998; Rigaud et al. 2009). examples or eany rorms or arr ana personal ornamenrarion comprise abstract designs on ostrich eggshells and on red ochre</page><page sequence="9">South African Archaeological Bulletin 70 (201): 113-123,2015 121 Enhanced FIG. 7.
