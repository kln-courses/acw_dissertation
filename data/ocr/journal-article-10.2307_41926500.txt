<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLY ISLAMIC HISTORY OF GHÜR by C. E. BOSWORTH St. Andrews I The province of Ghür in Afghanistan has long been one of the least- known regions of the eastern Islamic world, and our knowledge about its history, its rulers and its peoples still has many gaps in it. In the 12th and early 13th centuries a local family, the Shansabânïs, spread their power beyond the confines of Ghùr and became an international force; but their florescence coincided with the appearance of two other dynasties, those of the Khwärizmshähs and the Mongols, who proved more powerful than the Ghürids. Although the Ghùrids were to leave their mark on India, Ghür itself now lapsed into obscurity, while its originally Iranian population became increasingly diluted with Turkish and Mongol pastoralists. II In 661 the Chinese T'ang dynasty organised the "Western Lands", which stretched beyond Khotan to the Persian frontier, into sixteen provinces of their empire. The Emperors regarded these lands as peripheral and as inhabited by barbarians; and although we have some Chinese material on Tukhäristän and on the Kabul and Gandhara areas, neither the Chinese administrative and geographical manuals nor the accounts of travellers like the Buddhist monk Huän-chuang throw any light on Ghür at this period. The Arab and Persian geographers showed little interest in Ghür. Until the 1 1th century it was a pagan land. It had no important urban centres for trade and industry, and no commercial routes crossed it, thereby necessitating the enumeration of roads and staging-posts characteristic of much early Muslim geographical literature. The anony- mous author of the Hudüd al-'älam (completed 982-3) lived in the ad-</page><page sequence="2">THE EARLY ISLAMIC HISTORY OF GHÜR 117 joining province of Gùzgân and served its princes, the Ferìghùnids. He asserts that they exercised suzerainty over Ghùr; but he shows no special concern to elucidate its geography.1 The biographers had no interest in Ghür because it produced no Muslim scholar or religious figure of even minor fame. The most Samcânï can do is to name three scholars of Baghdad with the laqab "al-Ghùrï" and suggest that they were perhaps of Ghür! origin; since they flourished in the 4th and early 5th centuries A.H., their forefathers may have been of servile origin, for pagan Ghür long supplied Islam with slaves.2 Without the history of the Shansabânï dynasty by their eulogist Minhäj ad-Dïn Jüzjänl, the Tabaqãt-i Nãsirl , written in 1260 for Sultan Näsir ad-Dïn Mahmùd Shäh of Delhi, our knowledge of Ghùrî history in the early Islamic period would be meagre indeed. Even in the last century or so, travellers in Afghanistan have shown far less interest in the topography and antiquities of Ghùr than in those of the more accessible Sistan, Qandahar and Kabul regions. These last have the more obvious attractions of being historic corridors for the movement of peoples and ideas and of having connections with the classical Hellenistic, Buddhist and Indian worlds. Fortunately, the work of the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan is now remedying this neglect of Ghür.3 Ghür lies in the west-centre of what is now Afghanistan, and comprises the basins of the upper Heri Rud, the Farah Rud, the Rud-i Ghor and the Khash Rud, together with the intervening mountain chains.4 These 1 Tr.

Longworth Dames' article in E.I. 1 which deals with the main branch of the family in Ghür. M. Maricq's researches into the topography and political divisions of mediaeval Ghür, illumined by what most earlier European writers on the subject have lacked, i.e. personal knowledge of the terrain, now satisfy many of the questions Minorsky had to leave unresolved in his survey of Ghür, H. al-'a., 333, 342-4. In so far as the authors are primarily concerned with the political and military history of the Ghürid empire at the period of its greatest florescence, this present paper supplies a prolegomenon on the early history of the region and, in particular, its religious and cultural development. 4 The modern district of Ghûrï on the upper Qunduz, to the south-west of Khanabad and north of the Ghorband (cf. G. Jarring, On the distribution of Turk tribes in Afghanistan , = Lunds Universitets Ârsskrift , N.F., Lund-Leipzig 1939, p. 16) is to be distinguished from the mediaeval province of Ghür.</page><page sequence="3">118 C. E. BOSWORTH rise to over 10,000 feet and become considerably higher as they run eastwards to the Hindu Kush. Ghür was difficult of access in mediaeval times and still is. The valley sides have deciduous woodlands and are often covered with mulberry and walnut trees, apricots and vines; they then rise steeply to the bare mountains. The valley bottoms are highly fertile, and already in the 10th century Istakhrl stressed the region's fruitfulness, with its streams, meadows and tillage. When in 1845 the French officer Ferrier penetrated into Ghür - the pioneer traveller from western Europe in these parts - he recorded that "In the valley of the Heri-Rood we found a succession of camps and villages and cultivation of all kinds, with cattle, horses and camels in vast numbers on the pastures". Today wheat and barley can be grown on the higher ground, while irrigation channels in the river bottoms conserve the waters of the melting snows; here, semi-tropical crops like rice are grown.5 After the Mongol invasions the pastoral element among the population increased ; whereas in the Sãmãnid, Ghaznevid and Ghürid periods the Tajik inhabitants had possessed herds and had enjoyed some fame as horse rearers, they had been primarily agriculturists. It seems that the language of these Tajiks had considerable dialectical divergencies from the Persian spoken in Khurasan and from that familiar to the Ghaznevid Sultans; for his campaign of 1020 into Ghùr the Prince Mascûd had to employ local interpreters.6 The accounts of the Ghaznevid campaigns in the early 11th century confirm Yäqüt's information that Ghür had no towns of note, but only agricultural settlements and - most typical feature of the landscape - fortified places and towers ( qasr , qalca , hisãr, küshk) in which a "bad- tempered, unruly and ignorant" people ( Hudüd al-cãlam , 110) could defend themselves. Under the Ghaznevids and Ghürids, the inaccessi- bility of these strongholds made them favoured places for immuring political prisoners.7 The fortresses' commanding positions reflected the fragmentation of political power in Ghür during this early period, a 5 Istakhrl, ed. de Goeje, 281; Ibn Hauqal, 2nd edn. of Kramers, 444; F.

There was no obvious centre from which the region could be dominated by a single ruler. Fírüzküh, eventually the capital of the whole of Ghür, was originally founded by the Ghùrid ruler Qutb ad-Din Muhammad (d. 541/1146-7) as capital of the petty principality of Warshãda on the Heri Rud allotted to him by his father.8 So before the decay of the Ghaznevids and the rise of the Shansabânïs to more than local significance, Ghür was a land of local chieftains, derebeys. The route down the Heri Rud is the most direct between eastern Afghanistan and Khurasan, but because of the wildness of Ghür, its paganism and the predatory activities of its people, it was little used for through traffic in early Islamic times. The routes from Kabul or Ghazna to Khurasan normally made long detours, either northwards across the Ghorband and through Balkh or southwards across the rivers and plains of Sistan via Qandahar and Bust.9 Under the Ghaznevids, the conversion of Ghür began, and the military might of the early Sultans enabled them to exert considerable influence within it; but the Ghaznevid official Abü'1-Fadl Baihaqï' s memoirs show that Sultan Mascüd (421-32/1030-41) made his major troop movements between Ghazna and Khurasan by the "Bust road" or the "Balkh road". Indeed, the onset of winter weather made the transfer of large forces between Ghazna and Ghür impossible.10 The central route through Ghür was used only by small detachments of troops or to convey urgent messages or when some other important reason demanded speed; such occasions became more frequent as Seljuq pressure on Khurasan increased. After the final ruin of Ghaznevid power in the west at Dendänqän in 1040, the defeated Sultan and his entourage fled through Gharchistãn and Ghür to the castle of a friendly chieftain of northern Ghür, Abü'l-cAbbäs b. Abï'l-Hasan Khalaf, whose father had gone over to Mas'üd's side when that prince had as governor of Khurasan led the Ghür expedition of 411/1020 and had subsequently fought for the Sultan against the Qarakhanids (see below).11 8 Jab. Nãs ., 48, tr. I, 339. The fact that Fírüzküh lies on the northern limits of Ghür, where it adjoins Gharchistãn, and not in the centre of Ghür, is explained by Maricq and Wiet, op. cit., 61 if. ; see also below, n. 45. The eccentricity of this position caused many scholars in the past to dismiss the possibility of Fírüzküh's lying in the Heri Rud basin. 9 Kohzad, op. cit., VI/ 1, 2-4, gives the mileage of the northern route from Kabul to Herat as 830, the southern one as 727, and the central one through Ghür as 540 (across the Unai pass) or 628 (via Bämiyän). 10 Jab.

BOSWORTH As well as practising agriculture and banditry, the bellicose inhabitants of Ghür specialised in the production of weapons and war equipment. The mountain massif of the Pamirs, the Hindu Kush and their outliers are all highly metalliferous, and as the name of one of Ghür's chief fortresses, Ãhengerãn or Pul-i Ähengerän, "Blacksmith's boundary", implies, iron must have been readily obtainable and so worked in Ghür. The Hudud al^ãlam records that "from this province come slaves, armour, coats of mail and good arms".12 When Mascûd campaigned in Ghùr in 1020, the chieftain Abü'1-Hasan Khalaf brought him shields and cuirasses, and when the stronghold of the chieftain Warmesh-Pat of Jurwas was captured, a tribute of arms was levied. Later he employed Ghûrï officers in his service as specialists in siege-warfare; in 1035 two of them directed the defence of Tirmidh against the sons of the Qarakhanid cAlïtigin with the aid of a powerful ballista jarrada). In the next century, the Shansa- bânï ruler of Ghür, Tzz ad-Dïn Husain (493-540/1100-46) used to send the Seljuq Sultan Sanjar as annual tribute armour, coats of mail, steel helmets and other war material, together with some of the ferocious watchdogs bred in Ghür.13 III The isolation and backwardness of Ghür is seen in the persistence there of paganism long after the surrounding territories had become Muslim. Jüzjänl is certainly premature in asserting that there were already in the time of Ya'qüb b. Laith (later 9th century) rival parties of Muslims and pagans among the chieftains of Ghür who were continually at war. Describing it as a dãr kufr , Istakhrî says he brings it into his purview only because there are a few Muslims there and because it is the biggest pagan enclave within the borders of Islam. He adds that the regions of Baghnïn (in Zãbulistãn), of the Khalaj, of Kabul and [Zamïn-] Däwar are partly 12 H. al-'a ., 110, 343; Ibn al-Athïr, ed. Tornberg, IX, 155; Jab. Nãs., 40, 356, tr. I, 321, II, 1047. The name "Ãhengerãn" is found in other parts of the Central Asian massif, e.g. an Ähengerän-Julgä between Tashkent and Andejän ( Bãbur-nãme , tr. A. S. Beveridge, London, 1912-21, pp. 90, 152, 161) and an Ähengerän in Qühistän (C. E. Yate, Khurasan and Sistan , Edinburgh, 1900, p. 127). Togan, "Die Schwerter der Germanen", Z.D.M.G., XC (1936), pp. 33-4, suggests a connection between metal- working in the Ghür and Kabul areas and the skills of the Qarluq further north. 13 Baih., 115, 119-20 (= Tab.

The Hudud al-cãlam describes the Ghùrïs as formerly pagan but now mostly Muslim. As Minorsky has pointed out, the stubborn resistance of the Ghûrïs in the first half of the 11th century against Ghaznevid attempts to control them shows that this claim was considerably exaggerated. Until this period, Ghür retained its reputation as a pagan land which supplied slaves, mainly to markets in Herat and Sistan.14 When in the 7th century the Arabs had secured Khurasan, they began to look northwards and eastwards. Although their main efforts were directed against Transoxania and the upper Oxus valley, the region to the east of Herat was also probed at an early date. Tabarï records under 47/667 that "in this year Ziyãd [b. Abïhi] sent al-Hakam b. cAmr al- Ghifãrl to Khurasan as Amïr. He then raided the mountainous region of Ghûr and Faräwanda, brought them into submission by force of arms and conquered them. He obtained from them captives and a large amount of plunder". This raid was apparently made from Merv or Herat.15 The expedition of 107/725-6 was a larger-scale operation. The governor of Khurasan, Abü Mundhir Asad b. cAbdallãh al-Qasrï, first raided Ghar- chistãn and received the submission and conversion to Islam of its king. Then he attacked Ghür, Jibäl Herät , the land to the south of Gharchistän ; the Ghûrïs hid their possessions in an inaccessible cave, but Asad let down men in crates ( tawâbït ) on the end of chains and recovered these valuables.16 This success tempted Asad to march into Ghür a second time, and in 108-9/726-8 he turned aside from a campaign against the Turks in Khuttal and invaded Ghür.17 Sporadic raids, unnoted by the historians, no doubt continued throughout the Umayyad period. We do 14 m, 245, 272, 281; I Hauq.2, 444; H. al-'a., 110, 343-4; Tab . Nãf., 38-9, tr. I, 317-18. 15 Tabarï, II, 84; Ibn al-Athïr, III, 380, under A.H. 47, quoting Tabarï but adding the detail, incredible for this early date, that the people of Ghür had apostatised from Islam; cf. L. Caetani, Chronographia islamica (Paris, 1912 if.), Ill, p. 517. Ya'qûbï, Historiae , ed. Houtsma, II, 264, mentions a raid of al-Hakam and al-Muhallab to Herat and Gûzgân, but does not assign a date to it. 16 Tab., II, 1488-9; I.A., V, 102, under A.H. 107; cf. Caetani, op. cit., V, 1347. 17 Tab., II, 1496-7; I.A., V, 103, under A.H. 108; cf. Caetani, op. cit., V, pp. 1360, 1372. In the verses of Thäbit Qutna given in Tabarï, loc. cit., the poet speaks of this second raid by Asad as essentially one against Turks. Eulogising the Arab leader, he says: "Groups of the Turks who live between Kabul and Ghürín came to you, since there was no place in which they might find refuge from you." It is thus possible that the regions of Güzgän or Bämiyän, rather than the purely Iranian region of Ghür, were the scene of these operations by Asad.</page><page sequence="7">122 C. E. BOSWORTH know that at some time before 121/739 Nasr b. Sayyär's commander Sulaimãn b. Sül raided Gharchistãn and Ghür.18 But no permanent control, even of the lightest kind, was established over Ghür at this time or in the succeeding century or so. The Arab commanders must have realised that a permanent occupation would be difficult and hardly worth the effort; there were much richer prizes to be gained in Transoxania and on the borders of India. Ghür's value was as a reservoir of slaves, and these could best be obtained by occasional, temporary incursions. In the Caliphate of al-Ma'mün, it is recorded that when in 205/821 cAbd al-Hamïd b. Shubaib was appointed deputy in Sistan by the gover- nor of Khurasan and Sistan, Ghassãn b. cAbbäd, the local Khawãrij were attacked and the provinces of Ghür, Hind and Sind continually raided.19 At the end of the 9th century the Sãmãnids expelled the Saffãrids from Khurasan, made the less aggressive successors of Yacqüb and cAmr their tributaries and extended a tenuous suzerainty over the region to the east of Ghür; but Ghür itself was left untouched. We know only of one successful expedition in this period. This was led by the Amïr Abü Jacfar, who came from the prominent Baihaq family of the Ziyâdïs and had been made governor of Baihaq in 364/974-5 by Abü'l- Hasan Sïmjûrï. He brought back many captives to Khurasan, and, like the earlier incursions, this was a slave raid in force rather than an attempt to gain a foothold in Ghür.20 Sebüktigin, when governor of Ghazna and Zãbulistãn on behalf of the Sãmãnids, is said to have made several attacks on Ghür across the southern frontier facing Zamïndâwar and Bust, and the existence of one punitive expedition, in which Mahmüd took part as a boy, has been uncovered by Nazim from the poetry of cUnsurï and Abü cÄmir an-Najdï. In gratitude for his victory in 384/994 over the rebellious generals Abü cAlï Sïmjûrï and Fâ'iq Khãsse, Sebük- tigin was awarded the governorship of Balkh, Bämiyän, Ghür and Gharchistãn by the Sãmãnid Amïr Nüh b. Mansür; and Jûzjânï's source could imply that a tribute of money and arms was already levied on the Shansabânï chieftain of Ãhengerãn, Muhammad b. Sûrï, in Sebüktigin's time.21 If any such control was in fact imposed, it can only have been 18 Tab., II, 1696; I.A., V, 179, under A.H. 121. 9 Tãrikh-i Sistãn, ed.

In the 10th and early 11th centuries, all the thughür facing Ghür were ringed with ribäts : at Ribãt-i Karwãn on the borders of Güzgän, at Ribãt-i Baz! in Gharchistãn, at Bãgh-i Wazïr to the east of Herat. MaqdisI describes the southern frontier adjoining Zamïndâwar as especially strongly defended with "fully-equipped [or "permanently-stationed"?] guards" ( hurrãs muratta- bün) ; at the ribãt of Dar-rang were kept arms, equipment and horses, and muräbitün resorted to it from all parts.24 We have no knowledge about what constituted the paganism of Ghùr. Ghür never formed part of the Sasanid empire, whose eastern boundary, as Marquart showed ( Erãnsahr , 64, 70), was normally at Tãlaqãn, not much beyond Merv ar-Rüdh; and the absence of any important trade route from the west militated against the religions of the Persian empire being brought to it.25 In the Shãhnãme the forces of Ghür are depicted 22 ťUtbI, at-Tďrikh al-Yaminî , with commentary by Shaikh Manïnï, (Cairo, 1286), II, pp. 122-5, Persian tr. by Jurbädhqäm, ed. cAlï Qawïm (Tehran, 1334), 199; I.A., IX, pp. 155-6; cf. Nazim, op. cit., pp. 70-3. This expedition may have been connected with events which were taking place in the adjoining land of Sistan. According to the Tãrikh-i Sistãn , 358-9, the financial exactions of Ghaznevid officials there combined with famine and plague during the years 400-2/1009-12 to cause a rebellion against Mahmüd. In the course of this the leaders (mashãyikh) of Sistan went in a deputation to Ghür for help. So the expedition against Ähengerän may have had a further aim, to discourage the Ghüris from helping these rebels against the Ghaznevids. 23 'Utbï, loc. cit.; I.A., loc. cit.; ťAufí, Jawãmi' al-hikãyãt , in Elliot and Dowson, History of India , II, pp. 195-6. 24 1st., 272; H. al-&lt;a ., 107; Baih., 115, 633, cf.

E. BOSWORTH as fighting on Afräsiyäb's side against Rustam.26 Although Tukhãristãn, Bãmiyãn and Kabul were long strongholds of Buddhism, the same absence of routes and the mountainous topography prevented this faith from penetrating into Ghür. However, the lands to the south of Ghür, such as Zamíndãwar, Ghazna and Qusdär, adjoined the Indian world and until the 10th century were culturally and often politically part of it. Kabul, Ghazna and Bust were key-points in the commercial intercourse between the eastern Islamic world and India, and the geographers often designate them "the merchants' resort" or "the entrepôt" (matjar,furdä) for India. The first two towns had in early Ghaznevid times colonies of Indian traders permanently resident there.27 The Sãmãnid slave general Alptigin came to power at Ghazna in 351/962 after defeating Abù cAlI (or Abü Bakr) Lawïk or Anùk (?); but this dispossessed native ruler (who, despite the kunya attributed to him, can hardly have been a Muslim) was later given military help from Kabul, at that time part of the empire of the Hindüshähi Rajahs of Waihand, and the influence here of this power- ful Indian dynasty was not finally dispelled till Mahmûd's time.28 Zamín- dãwar had once possessed a great shrine and pilgrimage centre devoted to the god Zùn or Zhün, whose fame as the temple of Su-na penetrated even to China, but whose cult was clearly Hindu and not Buddhist in nature. Marquart plausibly suggested that the cult of Zün might be connected with the famous shrine of the Sun-God Äditya at Multan, and that the temple of Zün still existed in the latter part of the 9th century when Yacqùb and (Amr b. Laith conquered the region as far as Kabul and Bãmiyãn.29 The Arabian traveller Abù Dulaf ( floruit mid-10th century) travelled within the Sãmãnid dominions from Bukhara to Zamíndãwar and in his first Risàia seems to confuse reports of the House of Gold in Multan with those of the temple of Zün.30 If any outside 26 Ed.

The most that can be said is that the sources do reveal certain connections of the early Shansabânïs with India. According to cUtbï, the chieftain Muhammad b. Sûrï whom Mahmüd of Ghazna defeated and deposed was a "Hindu", but this may be merely a general term for "pagan", especially as the majority of the heathen whom Mahmüd came up against in his campaigns were of course Indians. However, Mustaufï and Mïrkhwând describe at this point in their accounts of the Ghürids the flight of Muhammad b. Sûrï's grandson Sãm to India, where he then took up residence in an idol-temple. His son Husain became a Muslim, went on to Delhi and grew rich as a trader, carrying goods between India and Ghür.31 These points do not add up to much, and unless more specific evidence comes to light, it is safest to argue from the silence of the sources that the paganism of Ghür was of an indigenous variety and without outside connections. It is significant that there is no mention in the accounts of the Ghaznevid campaigns in Ghür of the religious cults of the Ghürls, no stories of idol-breaking or the eradication of repugnant customs, even though for one of them, Mas'üd's campaign of 1020, we have an especially detailed eye-witness account. So far as we can see, Ghürl paganism had little positive content, but expressed rather the cultural backwardness of the region and its isolation from the surrounding higher civilisations. IV The Islamic history of Ghür really begins with Mahmüd of Ghazna (389-421/999-1030). Nevertheless, in the Tabaqät-i Nâsirï and in the works of the other great eulogist of the Ghürids, Fakhr ad-Dïn Mu- bärakshäh, we see later efforts to give the Shansabânïs a glorious past and connect them with both Islamic religious life and history and also the Iranian pre-Islamic past. Jüzjäni first puts forward "as a great probability" that the eponymous founder of the dynasty, Shansab, was have heard some local reminiscences of the shrine of Zün, and it would be interesting to know how fresh these were in the minds of his Zamîndâwarï informants. I have not been able to ascertain what conclusions, if any, the latest translator of and commentator on the first Risàia , A. von Rohr-Sauer (Des Abu Dulaf Bericht über seine Reise nach Turkestan, China und Indien , Bonn, 1939) has reached on this point. 31 ťUtbí, loc. cit.; Mustaufï, Tãrikh-i Guzide , G.S.M. facs.

E. BOSWORTH contemporaneous with the Caliph cAlï and was converted to Islam by the Caliph personally. He received from him a manshür for Ghür, and this charter was jealously handed down within the Shansabânï family until the time of Sultan Bahrãmshãh of Ghazna (5 1 2-47/ 111 8-52). Hence during the Umayyad period, according to Fakhr ad-Dïn, Ghür had the proud distinction of being the only land where cAlï's name was retained in the khutba. Jùzjânï then turns aside to trace the family's origin to the tyrant of Iranian mythology, Azhd Zahãk, whose descendants are said to have entrenched themselves in Ghür when Zahäk's thousand-year dominion was overthrown by Ferïdûn.32 Returning to the Islamic theme, the Amïr Füläd b. Shansab is given a part in the Abbasid revolution at Abü Muslim's side, and then there comes a more elaborate tale. The two rival families of Ghür, the Shansabänls and the Shlthãnls (or Shïshânïs, in the pronunciation of the Ghûrïs), both resorted to the court of Härün ar-Rashld, where Amïr BanjI of the first family received a robe of honour, a standard and a patent of investiture with the rulership (imãrat) of Ghür, while his rival Shlth b. Bahräm was awarded the military command ( pahlavânï ) of the forces of Ghür, "an arrangement which has continued like this till the present day".33 From the religious point of view, these stories are clearly myths of a type familiar within the Islamic world. From the political one, the local origins of the Shansabânïs are quite obscure, but they cannot have elbowed aside other chieftains in Ghür and consolidated their grip on the whole province until the second half of the 11th century at the earliest. A key to this story of the division of power may lie in events which Jüzjänl reports from Sultan Saif ad-Din Muhammad's reign (556-8/ 1161-3). He relates how the Sultan treacherously murdered his com- mander-in-chief (sepahsãlãr), Warmesh b. Shlsh, but was in turn stabbed 32 Fakhr ad-DIn Mubärakshäh and a Muntakhab-i tãrikh-i Nãsiri written in Sultan Muťizz ad-Dïn Muhammad b. Säm's reign, in Tab. Nã§., 28-34, tr.

Marquart was the first to point out the fact that the Ghürids, despite the frequency of the name "Säm" in their genealogy, did not derive their origin from Rustam's family, but from that of the tyrant Zahäk, a repugnant figure in the tradition of the Iranian lands further to the west ("Das Reich Zäbul", pp. 289-90).

Shlsh, who had succeeded to the office of sepahsãlãr and is called "Pahlavãn-i Ghür and from the Shïshânï family". It was probably a desire to explain these circumstances of the 12th century which led to the elaboration of the story about a division of offices in Härün's reign. The Shïshânîs were obviously a powerful family in the middle of the 12th century, powerful enough through their military following and prestige to challenge the Shansabânï kings' authority in Ghür. We do not know how old the rivalry was, but the episode illustrates how tensions arose within Ghur as the Shansabânïs asserted their primacy and how this primacy was still being challenged at this late date.34 Finally, we may note a very popular legend which historians of the Afghans set forth. As Jüzjänl does not mention it, it probably grew up after his time, but it may be read in detail in Nicmat Allâh's Makhzan-i Afghânï (written 1021/1613). According to this, Islam came to the Afghans who had settled in Ghür after the dispersion of the Children of Israel, through the agency of Khälid b. al-Walïd. He wrote to their leader Qais announcing the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets, and Qais came with a band of fellow-chieftains to help Muhammad at Medina. The Prophet gave him the Islamic name of cAbd ar-Rashld and sent him back to evangelise Ghür.35 Let us return to fact. After the expedition of 1010-11 Sultan Mahmüd left teachers to instruct the people of Ghür in the precepts of Islam.36 He dethroned Muhammad b. Sûrï of Ähengerän and installed his eldest son Abü cAlï; during Muhammad b. Sûrï's chieftainship, explains Jüzjänl, the son had sought closer relations with the Sultan, whereas the 34 Ibid., 65-6, tr. I, 366-7. The name Shlth or Shïsh also appears within the Shansabânï royal line {ibid., 41, tr. I, 329). If it were possible to attach any significance to this alleged division of power, we would be reminded of the institution of double kingship found among certain Altaic peoples. Marquart did in fact suggest, on very slight evidence, that there was some such arrangement in the neighbouring kingdom of Zäbulistän, whose ruler had the title of Zunbïl/Zûnbïl, before the Saffãrid conquest ("Das Reich Zäbul", pp. 275-6). Although there were in eastern Afghanistan strong Turkish ethnic currents, such as the Khalaj and Oghuz nomads, relics perhaps of Ephthalite dominion there, Ghür was at this time a purely Iranian land, and a division of power in a politically-unified Ghür plays no part in Jüzjäni's narrative except in conjunction with Warmesh's murder. Maricq, Le minaret de D jam, pp. 61-3, has arrived at the same explanation as myself for this projection-back of the Shansabânï- Shïshânï rivalry; and he has also made the valuable identification of the Shïshânï family of chiefs with the *Warmesh-pat of Jurwas in Baih., 116-19, thus elucidating Minorsky, H. al-1 a., 333. 35 History of the Afghans , tr.

Abü cAlï reigned until some time during Sultan Mascùd's reign, when another member of the Shansabânï family set him aside. Jûzjânï praises Abû cAlï as the Amïr who firmly planted Islamic institutions in Ghür: "As soon as the Amïr Abü cAlï became established in Ghür, he conferred great benefits on the people and directed the erection of many buildings of public utility. He built Friday mosques and madrasas in the land of Ghür and endowed them liberally with auqãf ' He held the religious leaders and ulema in great respect, and considered it a duty of his rank to venerate hermits and ascetics. Thus the inhabitants of the regions of Ghür dwelt in tranquillity."37 During the next century, Ghür became a buffer-state between the Seljuqs and the truncated Ghaznevid empire. Ghür, together with Sistan, Herat and Püshang, was allotted to Müsä Yabghu b. Seljuq when, after the victory of Dendãnqãn in 1040, the Seljuq leaders partitioned the lands they had conquered.38 Whether Müsä Yabghu was in fact able to exercise any control over Ghür and counter the influence from the east of the Ghaznevids is dubious. The 14th century historian Shabänkära'i implies that it was Ghaznevid influence which continued to predominate, for he states that Ghür fell away when Sultan cAbd ar-Rashïd was assassinated by a usurper in 444/1053. 39 This control may have been restored by the capable and energetic Sultan Ibrâhïm b. Mas'üd, but after his death in 492/1099, the Ghaznevids declined and the Ghürids overthrew them some 70 years later. We know nothing about the progress of Islam in Ghür during the century or so after Amïr Abü cAlf s death, but it cannot have met with any prolonged resistance; local paganism can have had small emotional appeal or intellectual content with which to oppose the new faith. Even so, the spread of Islam through this broken and isolated region must have taken a certain amount of time. I suggest that in this work of evangelism, the Muslim sect of the Karämiyya played an unspectacular but important part.40 This sect was Khurasanian in origin; its founder, 87 Tab. Nã 41, tr. I, 329. Already by 1032 a Ghaznevid official had possessions in Ghür (Baih., 326). 38 cImäd ad-Dïn in Bundäri, Zubdat an-nuçra , ed. Houtsma (Leiden, 1889), p. 8; al-Husainï, Akhbãr ad-daulat as-Saljüqiyya , ed. M. Iqbal (Lahore, 1933), p. 17. Ghür is not mentioned as part of Müsä Yabghu's share in Rãwandí, Rãhat aç-çudûr, ed.

Karãm (the correct spelling of this name seems to be without tashdïd ar-rď), came from Sistan, but studied and taught for some time in Nishapur before his death in exile in 869. According to his orthodox opponents, he taught an extreme theological literalism and was guilty of anthropomorphism. After his death, the leaders of the sect appear frequently in Khurasanian political and social life as a violent and persecuting force against religious dissent; they gained the backing of many sections of the peasantry and the urban lower classes through their piety and ascetic lives. Moreover, they had some support and sympathy from Sebüktigin and Mahmüd of Ghazna, and in the latter's reign they almost gained permanent control of Nishapur. This attempt was quashed, but the Karämiyya remained an influential element in Khurasanian religious life down to the Mongol invasions. The Karä- miyya had an old tradition of evangelism in the lands on the upper Oxus ; according to Shahrastânï, Muhammad b. Karäm's first activities after expulsion from his native Sistan had been amongst the peasants and illiterates of Gharchistän, Ghür and the countryside of Khurasan.41 It is therefore possible that the sprinkling of Muslims in Ghür mentioned by the geographers of the 10th century were the fruits of his preaching and that in subsequent times the Karämiyya kept up some connections with Ghür. In his concern for the pacification of Ghür, Mahmüd's relations with the Karämiyya in Nishapur may have suggested to him that here was a safe outlet for their missionary zeal. There are many parallels outside the Islamic world where an enthusiastic but doubtfully orthodox sect has been deflected to work in remote, unevangelised areas : the work of the Monophysites in Nubia, Ethiopia and South Arabia, of the Paulicians in eastern Anatolia and the Balkans under the Byzantines, and, in more recent times, of the Old Believers beyond the Urals in Siberia, comes to mind. I have not so far found any direct evidence on the course of this activity, but the connection of the sect with the early Ghaznevid Sultans and that dynasty's concern - if only on the grounds of political stability - for the conversion of Ghür are significant. Furthermore, we do have two interesting accounts of how the Ghürid kings finally renounced their adherence to the Karämiyya in favour of the more orthodox Muslim law-schools. These are given by Ibn al-Athlr under the year 595/1199 and by Jüzjän!.42 41 Kitãb al-milal wďn-nihal , ed. W. Cureton (London, 1846), p. 20, tr. T. Haarbrücker (Halle, 1850-1), I, pp. 29-30. On the origins and early history of the sect, see Bosworth, "The rise of the Karämiyyah in Khurasan", Muslim World , L/l (Jan. 1960), pp. 5-14. 42 Tab. Nã?.y 77-80, tr. I, 384-5; I.A., XII, 101. The episode has been treated, in a</page><page sequence="15">130 C. E. BOSWORTH Jùzjânï states that Ghiyäth ad-Dïn Muhammad (d. 599/1202-3) and his brother and successor Mucizz ad-Dïn Muhammad (d. 602/1205-6) both inherited the Karãml tenets which their dynasty had always held and which had always been the majority faith of their subjects. The two sources relate the story of the two rulers' conversion in different ways, but agree that the main stimulus came from the ShãficI faqlh Shaikh Wajlh ad-Dïn Abü'1-Fath Muhammad b. Mahmüd al-Marvar- rùdhï (Jûzjânï, 77, has Wahïd ad-Dïn Muhammad-i Marvazï, with the variant Marvarrûdhï). According to Ibn al-Athïr, Shaikh Wajïh ad-Dïn came to the Ghùrid court in 1199 through the agency of the court poet Fakhr ad-Dïn Mubãrakshãh, exposed the errors of the Karãmiyya and converted Ghiyäth ad-Dïn to his own rite. The Sultan then built madrasas in his dominions for the Shâficïs and built a mosque for them at Ghazna (this may have been the first Shâfi'ï one there since the destruction of Ghazna by cAlã' ad-Dïn Jehân-Sûz). Then Ibn al-Athïr gives another explanation, that the two brothers were converted through the pressure of social and religious circumstances when they conquered Khurasan.43 "They were told then that 'all the people of this land [sc. Khurasan] condemn and despise the Karãmiyya. It would be advisable for you to give up their doctrines'. So they both became Shâficïs." From his Mesopotamian homeland, Ibn al-Athïr had difficulty in harmonising accounts of events in the far east of the Islamic world, and he adds yet another report, that Mucizz ad-Dïn became not a Shâficï but a Hanafï; this is confirmed by the story in Jûzjânï that he became a Hanafï when he began to rule in Ghazna (sc. in 569/1 173-4) and saw that all the people of Ghazna and the surrounding territory were Hanafïs. It therefore seems that the brothers' abandonment of Karâmï doctrines was connected with the extension of their power into the Khurasan and Ghazna regions. They burst out of the confines of Ghür, where the Karâmï divines had had paramount authority in religion, into the wider world. They came into contact here with the two chief law-schools of Sunnï Islam in the east, and they may have felt that the Karâmï tenets were intellectually briefer manner than here, by Köprülüzade M. Fuat, "Xllnci asïrda bir Türk filologu: Fahreddin MUbarekçah ve eseri", Türk dili ve edebiyatï hakkïnda araçtïrmalar , (Istanbul, 1934), pp. 132-4, and by Maricq, Le minaret de D jam , pp. 49-50. 43 The Ghürids occupied Herat in 571/1175, and shortly afterwards their suzerainty was recognised in Kerman. Ghiyäth ad-Dïn began the conquest of Khurasan as soon as the Khwärizmshäh Tekesh died, and occupied Nishapur in 596/1200 and Merv and Serakhs the next year {Jab. Näs., 73-5, tr. I, pp. 377-8, 380-1 ; cf. M. Longworth Dames, E.I.1, Art. "Ghõrids", and Wiet, Le minaret de Djam , pp. 38-43).</page><page sequence="16">THE EARLY ISLAMIC HISTORY OF GHÜR 131 somewhat disreputable and too closely linked with their backwoods origins. Jûzjânï's account of Ghiyãth ad-Dïn's conversion is adorned with a more miraculous element: Shaikh Wajïh ad-Din is involved, but the immediate cause is the Sultan's vision in a dream of the Imãm ash-ShãficL The change, he goes on to relate, angered the numerous ulema of the Karã- miyya. One of them, the Imãm Sadr ad-Dïn cAlï b. Haisam Nïshâpûrï, who was mudar ris of the Karâmï madrasa at Afshïn or Bashïn in Gharchistän, censured the Sultan in some verses, and as a result, had to withdraw to Nishapur for a year before he recovered favour. This Imâm's Nïshâpûrï origin, and the fact that he chose that city for his temporary exile, show that the Karãmiyya were still important and still producing their own divines there, despite the report in Ibn al-Athïr about the low prestige of the Karämiyya in Khurasan.44 But if the Karâmï doctrines could not in Khurasan retain an intellectual repute comparable to that of the Hanafï or Shâfi'ï rites, in Ghür itself their hold on both the populace at large and on other members of the Ghürid dynasty was little diminished. Again under 595/1199, Ibn al-Athïr records a great fitna at Ghiyãth ad-Dïn's military headquarters and capital at Fïrùzkûh in Ghür.45 Its cause was the Sultan's favour towards the Shâfi'ï faqïh and philosopher Fakhr ad-Dïn Râzï (543-606/ 1148-1209), who had been attracted to the court by Ghiyãth ad-Dïn's well-known munificence towards scholars and literary men. According to cAufï, Râzï gained there the title Malik al-kalãm .46 The Sultan built for him a madrasa in Herat where Râzï's teaching attracted many hearers, but drew down on his head the wrath of the Karãmiyya, who were very numerous there, and of the Ghûrïs in general, headed by the Sultan's cousin and son-in-law, Malik Diyä' ad-Dïn Muhammad (ruled in Ghùr and Zamïndâwar 599-603/1203-7 and 611-12/1214-15 with the title cAlã' ad-Dïn). Râzï was well-known as a bitter opponent of the 44 Mïrkhwând, IV, p. 244, merely records that Ghiyãth ad-Dïn became a Shâfiï* because of the Shãfrts' purity of life and emphasis on traditions from the Prophet. 45 On Fírüzküh, cf.

"Fïrûzkôh" followed Holdich in identifying it with Taiwãra on the Rud-i Ghor in the southern part of the province. Maricq has now shown that the 200 ft. tall Minaret of Jam standing on the right bank of the Heri Rud between Chisht and Ähengerän marks the site of the Ghürids' fortress-capital. The neglect until now of this minaret by European travellers has arisen from the fact that in recent times the route through the Heri Rud basin has made a detour out of the river- valley and along an affluent, and has thus by-passed the site (Le minaret de Djam, pp. 13-20, 55-64). 46 'Aufï, Lubãb al-albãb, quoted by Köprülüzade, op. cit., pp. 130-1.</page><page sequence="17">132 C. E. BOSWORTH Karämiyya. Ibn al-Qiftï says that they threatened to have his life in revenge for his attacks on them and that it was said to be they who finally poisoned him; certainly, Râzï left instructions that he was to be buried in his house rather than publicly, lest the Herat mob mutilate his corpse.47 Râzï and the ulema of the Karämiyya, Hanafïs and Shâficïs gathered at the Fïrûzkùh court. In a theological disputation, Râzï attacked a Karâmï divine well-known for his piety and learning, the Qâdï Majd ad-Dïn, known as Ibn al-Qudwa.48 In reply, Malik Diyä' ad-Dïn Muhammad accused Râzï of zandaqa and falsafa , and Ibn al-Qudwa denounced him from the pulpit, attacking at the same time the teachings of Aristotle, the infidelities of Ibn Sïnâ and the philosophy of al-FãrãbL The population was so roused that they rose and bloodshed was only averted by the arrival of troops from the Sultan's palace. Ghiyãth ad-Dïn had to promise to remove Râzï from their midst and send him back to Herat.49 The episode probably dates from just after the Sultan's con- version to the Shâficï madhhab, when he wished to encourage the great philosopher but was apprehensive lest he alienate the popular support of the Ghûrï people, upon whom the military strength of the dynasty largely depended. In this survey of the religious history of Ghür at this period, we may finally note that the Karämiyya were strongly opposed to the Bãtiniyya; it was their fervour in rooting out Ismâcïlï sympathisers in Nishapur at the beginning of the 11th century which so commended them to Sultan Mahmüd.50 Now Ismâcïlï diïïs from Alamùt penetrated into Ghür in the latter years of the Sultan *Alã' ad-Dïn Husain Jehän-Süz's reign (544-56/1149-61), were sympathetically received by him and started to work in the countryside. But his son Saif ad-Dïn Muhammad (556-8/ 1161-3) ordered on his accession a massacre of all Ismâ'ïlï adherents in Ghür: "Wherever he smelt the odour of their seductions, throughout all 47 Tďrikh al-hukamď , ed.

He despatched the whole of them to Hell, and thus by means of the sword purified the territories of Ghür, which were a mine of righteousness and orthodoxy, from the pollution of the Qarmathian evil."51 It is in persecuting activity such as this that one would expect to find the Karâmï leaders prominent. The silence of later sources shows that in the chaos caused by the Mongol invasions the Karämiyya gradually lost their separate identity in Ghùr and the surrounding regions. The historian of Herat, Muln ad-Dïn Zamchï, writing in 1492, characterised the people of Ghùr as notoriously stupid but impeccably pure in their faith and hatred of innovation.52 As in Nishapur two centuries previously, the sect's appeal to the unsophisticated mountain folk of Ghür lay primarily in the godly lives of its imãms and the straightforward literalism of its teachings; yet if, as I have suggested, it brought Islam to this remote corner, its achievement was a not unworthy one.53 51 Tab.
