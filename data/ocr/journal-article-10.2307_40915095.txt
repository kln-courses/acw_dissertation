The Rock-tracings herein considered consti- tute a type of figures sculptured mostly on sloping ledges of rock, throughout the Scandinavian North. They are found most extensively in the county of Bohuslan in Southwestern Sweden, and in the adjoining county of Smaalenene in south- eastern Norway.1 They are, however, present in considerable number also elsewhere in the Scandinavian Peninsula and to a small extent in Jutland and the Danish Isles. Those of south- ern Scandinavia are, mainly at any rate, of symbolic character. These so-called South Scandinavian rock-tracings extend as far north as Tj0tta in Nordland, Norway. Somewhat south of this, at Bardal in North Trondhjem Province,2 they overlap, on the same rock into the very different naturalistic type of figures, generally called North Scandinavian rock-tracings. Only the former type will be considered in the following pages. The sculptured figures are oftenest seen on smooth gently sloping ledges of high-lying rocks, but also often on more abruptly inclined surfaces or even on the vertical wall of the lower levels of mountains; they are, furthermore, seen on the top and on the sides of large loose-lying boulders.8 Some figures are frequently seen on the slabs of Bronze-Age graves. The round hemi-spherical or ball-like depressions, usually 1 The rock-tracings of Smaalenene are found in the southern part of the county from Idsletten on the Swedish border to Glommen (hence to Sarpsborg). 1 Bardal lies in Beitstaden Parish in Eastern Fosen. This is inland, but near the Beitstaden Fjord. The western half of the Peninsula of Fosen, that is the coast half, three quarters of the way up, forms a part of South Trondhjem Province. 1 Tracings in general are always found near water. A marked map would show them dotting the coast line from Upland, Sweden, to Nordland, Norway. Where they lie inland the location is always near lakes or fjords. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 called "cups" or "bowls," occur in considerable number also in megalithic graves, sometimes on the side-stone, but especially on the cover stone, - and here not only on the top but also on the under side of the stone.4 A figure may sometimes be found singly, i. e., only one on a stone, but this is rarely the case. Of Norwegian tracings5 known down to 1873, 164 in all,6 only thirteen are of a single figure. Of those later found and of those within Sweden single-figure tracings are hardly ever met with. They have usually been applied in larger or smaller groups, or, I should rather say, they are so found now. It is conceivable that the figures appearing on a single rock may not all have been applied at the same time. In a great many cases they could not possibly all be by the same man.7 It is perfectly clear that in some cases the various incised figures on a rock represent a considerable measure of time. Commonly there are ten, twenty, or forty figures; in some cases the number exceeds a hundred.8 There is considerable uniformity in the sculptures appearing; certain objects are met with in all regions and they are made the same way. There are, however, differences also, as in the depth with which they are applied, in the size of the figures, in the absence or presence of any effort at arrangement, and whether they are solid figures or made in contour; further also in the prevalence of certain figures in one place and of others elsewhere, in the tendency in one locality to cut groups of one figure, while elsewhere the groups are vary-figured. Bohuslan 4 That is on the top and side of the huge cover-stones of dolmens and pas- sage chambers, or on the top and under side of the cap-stones of stone cists. 8 The term "tracing" is used not of the individual figures but of a tracing group, that is the sculptured rock where one or more figures are found. 6 Of these 144 were in Smaalenene. The list, with very brief descriptions, was given by 0. Rygh in Forhandlinger i Videnskabsselskabet, Chris tiania, 1873, pp. 455-470. 7 There are too many figures and the technique of some differs from that of others. • On the Hvitlycke stone in Tanum, Bohuslan, I count 156 figures. It is shown by Almgren in GBF, VIII, fig. 181.</page><page sequence="3">3 exhibits without comparison the greatest variety, and the greatest massing of figures. In the depth to which they are cut they vary in general from a quarter of an inch to three inches; in breadth from one to three. But this may differ greatly on the same rock. The types or kinds of objects figured are the following: cups or cressets, the single circle, or the group of concentric circles; the spiral; the four-spoked wheel, and the wheel of more than four spokes; the swastika, the triskele; axes, hammers; spears, bow and arrow; ships and parts of ships; a few vehicles, once a plow; the human form; the hand, foot-soles, shoe-soles; various kinds of animals, especially the horse, and other four- footed animals, also birds, and a few times a serpent; finally straight and curved lines or furrows, and various undetermined simple figures or groups of figures. Plates III and IV show a selection of the figures. Of most of the South Scandinavian rock-tracings in the different regions there exist now excellent reproductions making possible their study also for those who can see but few of the rocks themselves. In fact they can perhaps best be studied from these.9 Scandinavian archaeologists and the artists who have worked with them have with vast labor and most pains- taking care made them accessible to the student in gypsum casts and paper casts, drawings, photographs of drawings, and photographs of the sculpturings themselves from different angles and under different light conditions,10 in a way that I am not aware has been done for similar monuments elsewhere. The methods that have been employed have, of course, been the same as those that have been developed in connection with the reproduction of runic inscriptions.11 Scientifically accurate • They are, of course, for the most part studied from these except in the case of new discoveries. 10 As in sunlight or on cloudy days, or by twilight, and even by artificial light at night. What could not be seen in daylight often came out clearly by twilight; lines that could not be seen in the general gray or black of the whole surface of the stone were discovered upon the application of water. 11 As in the use of "runic paper."</page><page sequence="4">4 and especially fine are the great corpus of reproductions of L. Baltzer for Bohuslan.12 But the same emphasis upon showing the shape, the outline, the relative position of figures, incomplete figures, and every smallest detail, has also been striven for in all the publications of tracings issued in the various archaeological series since about 1880 We lack as yet, however, a similar work for the exceedingly interesting figured rocks of Smaalenene. It is to be hoped that the Norwe- gian Society for the Preservation of Ancients Monuments will be able in the near future to undertake this work for the sculptures of Smaalenene, before time has made further inroads upon them. A view of the whole body of reproductions as they now exist reveals that cups and circles and certain smaller figures occupy a very prominent place among them. This is particularly the case in certain regions. However, these figures were not so prevalent in the early days of the study. It was chiefly ships, animals, and human figures that occupied the foreground among the tracings that were then known. The ships were so num- erous sometimes that rocks with tracings on them were simply called ship-rocks. The farmer could tell the inquirer of a rock or a mountain- wall with ships cut into it; often, perhaps, he observed these figures because he recognized them, but usually the ships were especially conspicuous. At Dammen, Brastad Parish, in Stangenas,13 Bohuslan, certain sculptured rocks are called skeppshdllarna, "the ship rocks." And the farm Sjebber- vall in Bottna Parish, Kville Hundred,14 took its name from the fact of the presence of such figured rocks on the farm. In the Bohuslan-Smaalenene zone as a whole the ships hold a domi- nant place, but human figures are also very numerous. Out- 11 Httllristningar fr&amp;n BokusUn. Its publication began in 1884 and it was completed in 1908, representing a life work of the author. The work contains 81 plates. A smaller work of selected rock-tracings was published in 1911 by Baltzer (see Bibliography). A few selections were used by O. Montelius in an article published in GBF, II, 1874. 11 For the Scandinavian herredy hdrad, I shall use the term "district," though I am tempted to use the old term "hundred" as being more exact. 14 In Bohuslan.

Also animal-figures are especially characteristic of this region, but they are numerous only in Tanum, Stangenas, and Kville, in Bohuslan.15 From these three districts ca. two hundred and seventy animal tracings had been published as early as 1848; while for the rest of Sweden and Norway combined less than twenty were known, and not many more than that are known to-day. Now, it was the rock-tracings of these districts of North Bohuslan that first attracted attention. It was with these that the study began. And it was not unnatural that a study which had as its point of departure a body of material in which tracings of human beings were everywhere present but also always associated with ships and horses and other animals, - it was not unnatural, that the investigator should come to regard them as a kind of picture-script, whose aim it was to preserve to posterity a record of the great events in the history of the tribe. And so there arose a school of interpreta- tion of the rock-tracings which we may call perhaps the histori- cal school,16 and parallels were drawn from pictographs in different parts of the world as those of the North American Indians, and the somewhat more developed ones of the Incas of Mexico. But sculpturings of a somewhat different character were also early known to exist down in the extreme southern part of Sweden, in Sk&amp;ne, and a few that typologically seemed to belong with these soon also came to light from southeastern Sweden. Some of these were fashioned with such evident care for proportion, and general artistic effect as to give evidence of a very considerable sense for beauty and skill to represent it in sculpture on the part of those who carved them.1? Some 18 It may be noted that elsewhere they are seen especially in Sk&amp;ne, Smaalenene and Eastern Fosen. » The effort to identify the tracing with some particular historical event is sometimes met with. This was the case now and then with those writers who dated the rock-tracings as late as the Younger Iron Age. To some of these writers the more elaborate configurations become a kind of lapidary record - an epic in stone - of deeds and exploits of heroes of the Viking Age. 17 The principal and finest one of these was, it seems, beautified somewhat by the artist who drew them.</page><page sequence="7">6 scholars then came to look upon the rock-tracings as genre- pictures, reproducing scenes in the life of the tribe; and their interest was then as monuments of the art of the time to which they belong. But there were others who thought their significance was neither of these; that in fact they had very little significance. They considered them to be nothing but exercises of idle hours, perhaps by members of the tribe in ancient times* but often perhaps in much more recent times, possibly made by workmen during the cutting of stone for some nearby building, or per- haps by children.18 Now we have noted above that certain small figures, as cres- sets and circles and wheels, are found among the rock-tracings everywhere, whereas humans and animals are in many regions rare or entirely lacking. And especially in Norway is this the case. Now I suppose it is perfectly possible that the tracings of Sk&amp;ne and those of the Bohuslan-Smaalenene zone may have had a different origin, a different original purpose, and that those of southern and western Norway may be of still another origin. But this is hardly likely. However, the first Norwegian scholar to study the rock-tracings comparatively took a wholly different view of them from that already held by writers before him.19 The figures were to him religious symbols that were to be interpreted in connection with burial customs and the belief in life after death. And so arose a school of inter- pretation which we may conveniently designate as the religious school. The Earliest Discoveries and Published Reproductions. In many localities it was more or less generally known among the peasantry that there were tracings or ship figures on certain rocks in the neighborhood;20 and already in 1627 scholarly inter- 18 Thus N. G: Bruzelius held them to have been made by workmen in modern times, Studier, Kritiker, og Notiser, 1841, Nr. 7. A form of this view, or rather a combination of it with the second interpretation above, seems to be that of Gustaf Bolinder in a recent article in Fornvttnnen, XVII, pp. 47-56. 19 C. A.

In that year Peder Alfss^n (Petrus Adolphi), at the time Lektor in Oslo Gymnasium, once a physi- cian in Bergen, late in life Lawman of Trondhjem, sent to Ole Worm in Copenhagen an account of ancient monuments in Smaalenene and Bohuslan, and accompanied this with drawings. Alfss^n's manuscript is preserved in the Arnamagnean Collec- tion, University of Copenhagen Library, as Nr. 371 folio.21 Among the monuments thus made public for the first time were, in addition to the Tune rune-stone in Smaalenene, the following rock- tracings; 1, one at the so-called Kvarnehedt near Braate- berg in Askum Parish, Hundred of Stingenas: 2, one of animal figures, two humans and possibly shields, and further; 3, an elaborate one of human beings, four-footed animals, birds and ships, on a rock located half a Swedish mile north of Brastad church, at Backa in Brastad Parish, District of St&amp;ngenas. None of these were published at the time, and it seems that Alfss^n's drawings of the first two groups have not been pub- lished. However, the large group from Backa was published by P. F. Suhm in 1784, in his "Fortegnelse paa gamle Monu- menter i Aggerhuus Stift."22 It has since been published in Gbteborgs och Bohusldns Forntninnen, I, 1874-77, p. 148, and as Figure 208 in Gustafson's Norges Oldtid. That a drawing of such a difficult object made at that time should be full of inac- curacies and that many lines and figures should have been over- looked entirely was inevitable. There are errors in the relative position of the figures, in their shape, in the omission of portions of figures, and in the omission of many smaller figures. Fur- ther the drawings are made with slender lines, so that the impression of primitiveness which the originals always give is destroyed in the drawing. If Alfss^n prepared his report about them, not in the presence of the rocks themselves but, with the drawings before him we can quite easily understand his view of them. It was his opinion that they had been made by workmen during the building of the Brastad church some n It is number 371 in Kaalund's Katalog over den arnamagndanske Haand- skriftsamling, vol. I.

That which I note particularly, then, is that the author of this first copy of a group of figures saw only the human beings, the animals, and the ships, and in one case a circle. Numerous smaller figures, that are no doubt of primary importance for the understanding of the rock-tracings as a whole, were not represented in the drawing. The next tracing to be brought to the attention of scholars was that of a ship on a rock on the Mokleryd farm in Thorshamn parish, Ostra Hundred, Blekinge, a drawing of which was published by Sven Lagerbring in 1746 in his Historia Blekingiae. It is a ship with twelve slanting lines which are assumed to represent oars. This is the so-called Hdsthellen, "the Horse- rock/' which is discussed by N. H. Sjoborg in 1792, Utkast till Blekings Historia och Beskrifning. According to this author there are twenty ships shown on the rock. One hundred years after Lagerbring's single tracing was published, the Danish antiquary J. J. A. Worsaae published the next drawings of Hdsthellen. They appear in his Blekingske Mindesnuzrker fra Hedenold, Copenhagen, 1846, Table XIV, with a separate table, XV, showing the size of one of the ships or figures. Twelve ships are here shown; the smaller ones having evidently not been observed.23 Next in order we have the Kivik Monument. This is one of the most remarkable in the whole body of rock-tracings, and in point of excellence of execution perhaps the finest. The sculptured slabs in question formed the side stones of a stone- cist taken out of a large burial mound at Kivik, half a mile north of Simrishamn on the southeastern coast of Skine.84 The grave had already been opened as early as 1749 and what- ever deposits it may have contained removed, thus destroying the evidence of the period to which the grave belongs which they would have furnished.

In Holmberg's SkH it forms figure 161. 84 This grave was, I believe, first described by the botanist Karl Linne" in his Sk&amp;nska Res a, 1749, p. 127, who remarked the similarity between the grave and the Ejalmars ror, at FalkBping, V&amp;tergo* tland.</page><page sequence="11">9 a few years later it was discovered that the side stones con- tained numerous figures of human beings, a chariot with horses and driver, two four-footed animals facing each other, two series of standing objects with curved contour resembling somewhat a large kind of fowl, two so-called cross-wheels or circles enclosing a cross, and other figures. Among the latter are especially noteworthy two splendid examples of axes of the type of the early Bronze Age, which, with some of the other figures, seem to date the grave and the tracings them- selves pretty definitely as belonging to the beginning of the second period of the Bronze Age or ca. 1600 B.C. The Kivik figures attracted a good deal of attention and several drawings of them were made ca. 1752-1756, one by F. Feldt, another by an unknown artist, which was published in J. G. M. MeuseFs Der Geschichtsj or scher, V, 1777, and two made by Nils Wessman, which, it seems, were not published, but are preserved in the Historical Museum, Stockholm. The artist C. G. G. Hilfeling made drawings of the stones,25 presumably in 1779, which were published in a work entitled Specimen histori- cum de monumento Kivikensi by Anders Chr. Forsenius at Lund, 1780,26 and these have been republished in most of the later illustrations of Kivik figures; the whole series is seen complete in Sven Nilsson's Skandinaviska Nordens Urinvdnare.27 Of early views about the Kivik figures those of F. Miinter are to be especially noted, published in Skandinavisk Museum, 1803, pp. 283-298. After describing the figures he says: "Af denne 28 There were seven figured stones. Of the four pictured in Sveriges Hednatid (Montelius), figures 126-129, the one whose enclosing frame is open at the top was later lost. One other which disappeared contained four horses and other figures; both, I learn, have recently been re-discovered. Another showed two wheels, etc., and a third a ship with a crew of six men. * Illustrations also in Suhm's Danske Hislorie, Vol. I, 1782, p. 528. *7 Part I: Brons&amp;ldern, 1862, 1864, p. 5.

Of the numerous works on it is one by Nils O. Wibcrg: Om Kiviksmonumentet, a Lund dissertation, 1850.

He regards it as a Druidic Sacrificial scene: "det forestiller en Menneskeoffring hvor overvundne Fiender blive slagtede til Gudernes ^Ere," p. 298.28 The first published drawings of rock-tracings in the Hundred of Sotenas, Bohuslan, were made in 1792, also by Hilfeling; there are several from Valla in Tossene Parish, and of one rock near the Hede-Ulveskel road in Tanum Parish, Hundred of Tanum. These were published in P. Tham's Gb'thiska Monu- menter, Stockholm, 1794.29 Thus attention was for the first time called to the presence of such monuments as far north as Tanum. Among those from Valla are the figures of the so- called Knippelsberget with striking ship-forms, and other interesting features. Objection was made (with some justice it appears) to this artist's drawings of these and the Kivik figures on the ground that he had beautified them. Among these earliest known tracings I desire finally to mention that at Ourup, locally called Skjeppestenen, in Idestrup Parish, Island of Falster, Denmark. The National Museum, Copenhagen, once possessed a drawing of the stone dating from 1810, but this has since been lost. At the time it was found the stone served as part of a stone fence on the left-hand side of the high- way between Nykj^ping and the Ourup farm. On this stone there were incised six four-rspoked wheels of varying size. Investigations of Professor Brunius. It was not until 1815 that a systematic search for rock-tracings was instituted. Hitherto there had been rather fragmentary material to deal with, and there had been no very definite attempt to explain 18 Forsenius, A. C, 1780, Specimen, etc., regarded them as representing a Roman triumphal procession; Suhm held that they were a memorial to Ragnar Lodbrok's son Ragnvald, who fell in a battle against the men of Skane. M (in- ter thought they were of Celtic origin. Most interesting was P. Wieselgren's view, that they represented a Nerthus festival. n They were later published in Sjo'borg's Samlingar for Nor dens ForniUska- re, III, pp. 142-146, and by Holmberg, SkH., Tables 31 and 32 (here those from Sotenas).</page><page sequence="13">11 the meaning of the rock-tracings.80 However, in the summer of 1815 Carl Georg Brunius, then but twenty-one years old, undertook a journey of investigation through his native parish Tanum in Bohuslan for the purpose of finding and copying rock- tracings, and this investigation he continued during the two following summers. The net result of this was a collection of nearly one hundred drawings. In 1818 he made a report of his work to Chancellor Lars von Engestrom, Lund University, but the drawings themselves were not published at the time. In fact only one of them, the Lisleby stone near Tegnaby, Tanum, was printed in Nordiska Fornletnningar, 1919, with two pages of commentary.81 Brunius believes that they are a kind of pictograph occupying a position in between the Egyptian hieroglyphics and Mexican figure-script. They are pictographs recounting happenings in the life of the tribe; but as such they are of two kinds; some of them represent scenes from the events themselves, others are purely symbolic. Of the former he then offers an example in the drawing from Lisleby. Here he sees two warriors engaged in a duel, each accompanied by his second; at some distance there is an on-looker. Another figure group on the same plate he considers to be a plowman at work. The symbolic figures are, e. g.: the birds stand for "threatening omens," the hollows or cups are inverted grave- mounds and represent "death," the foot soles betoken "landings," etc. It is to be noted that Brunius' theory assigns a symbolic explanation to a large number of the smaller figures; but he finds their meaning to be allegorical, that is they are an essen- tial element in the historical tablet as a whole, for they sym- bolize states of mind of the combatants, phases of the conflict or its results, etc. Also this part of Brunius' interpretation is met with among other writers long afterwards.32 For various reasons the mass of rock-carvings found by Brunius could not 10 Among early attempts in this direction are to be mentioned those of F. Mttnter in Skandinavisk Museum, 1803, pp. 283-298, and R. Nyerup's Oversyn over Fadrelandets Mindesmmrker fra Oldtiden, 1806, vol. pp. 101-103. 11 Edited by Brunius and Liljegren; it began publication in 1819 and con- tinued to 1823. w And among early writers on the Kivik monument.</page><page sequence="14">12 be published at the time. But the interest that they had awakened in him remained with him for life, and he dealt with them in various works, as in his Antiqvarisk och arkitektonisk resa genotn Holland, Bohusldn, Dalsland, Vermland och V ester- gotland dr 1839, published at Lund, 1839, and in the journal Studier, Kritiker, och Notiser, Lund, 1841, and finally in his chief work on the subject Forsok till Forklaringar ofver Hall- ristningar, Lund, 1868. This work contained fifteen plates, most of which seem fairly correct as far as the individual figures or smaller groups are concerned but unfortunately the figure- complexes as a whole are not shown. I note here again the fact that the first significance of Brunius' journeys of investiga- tion in 1815-17 was the bringing to light of the fact of a vast body of rock-tracings in Tanum Parish, Bohuslan, and the directing of scholarly interest to this parish as the real home of monuments of this kind. Brunius' own historical interpreta- tion of the carvings was an effort to explain the hundred figure-complexes that he had discovered. These were large tablets with scores of figures on some of them and numerous groups of, apparently, warriors together with their arms and other possessions. And in one form or another this concep- tion of the meaning of them continued to be held by most schol- ars clear down to the end of the century. Brunius was upon one important point more nearly right than other writers of his time, namely as to the age to which they belong and the manner in which the figures had been made. While others held that they belong to the Iron Age, and that they could in fact not have been made except with iron tools, Brunius maintained that they could be, and must have been, cut or rubbed with tools of stone, and that they go back to the Age of Stone and the beginning of that of Brtaize.83 To establish the manner of the execution of the rock-tracings Brunius regarded as the main thesis of his Forsok in 1868 (p. 57). And he made the claim for expert knowledge upon this point that none should dispute, for he had for more than a quarter of a century been the direct- ing head of large stone-cutting works, where he had himself by M Sec also Hans Hildcbrand in AtfSv., VI, 5, pp. 23-25.</page><page sequence="15">13 way of experiment produced tracings like those on the rocks in the regions where they are found. And he showed, e. g., that sandstone and even softer stones were particularly serviceable for making impressions upon hard stones, as granite. As to the question of the comparison with the runic inscriptions that had been made, Brunius emphasized the great difference be- tween the two in point of technique. The lines of the runes are slender and deep, while those of the tracings are broad and shallow. New Discoveries in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 1820-1840. However, since the beginning of these studies, the results of which have here been briefly sketched, many new discoveries had been made, and information about rock-tracings was spreading. It was now known also that there were similar monuments in Norway. I do not know just how far back in the century the first published accounts go that speak of foot-soles and hoof-like depressions in the rocks in various places in Norway. Their existence in many places was well known among the peasantry, and the lore about them was considerable. But the earliest account that played any part in the study was a report by Bishop J. Neumann of a journey in Sogn and S^ndfjord in 1823, which was published in Budstik- ken in 1824, Column 584.84 Then in 1828 W. F. K. Christie inspected and made drawings of these. It is the two groups of tracings of a total of twenty-four ships and two rings on two sloping rocks on the Leervaag farm on Atle Island, Sjzfndfjord. The situation is halfway between Vilnes church and Souesund, where at Nastvigen Bay was found the exceedingly interesting group of sixteen ships. Eight others were found in scattered places on a similar rock at Vardenaesset near by. Christie's drawings were first published in Urda, I, 1834, plate IV,85 14 Urda, I, p. 91. The Leervaag rock is also mentioned by J. Neumann in a report concerning a journey in Bergen Diocese printed in Nordisk Tidsskrift for Oldkyndighed, 1836, p. 256. u The references to this always say 1837. However, Urda began publi- cation in 1834, and the article and plates with the Leervaag rock-tracings ap- peared in the issue of that year. With the fourth number in 1837 the volume was completed and the title page bears that date.</page><page sequence="16">14 showing the relative position and the shape of the ships in the first group, as well as the shape of the remaining eight. They are regarded by Christie as records in stone of historical events, the identification of which, however, he thinks no longer possible.36 It is to be observed that in one case the figures are all ships, in the other also ships, but with these, two rings or circles. Christie supplements his account with a brief survey of simpler figures known from other parts of Norway, which makes a list of no less than eleven places. Among these may especially be noted that of foot-soles and round depressions on a rock near Moster church on the Island of Moster, S^ndhordland, which the populace explained as "the marks of human hands, knuckles, and elbows."37 In 1834 there was added a second Danish find, namely the Herrestrup stone from Grevinge Parish, District of Od, in the Island of Sealand. On the top and on one side of this huge cover-stone of a dolmen were observed a number of figures, comprising three four-spoked wheels and three ships with crew strokes. These figures were published as Plate X in Annaler for nordisk Oldkyndighed, 1842-1843.38 The tracings are here exceedingly shallow, and those of the ships were not at first observed. The figures are of the simplest ship-type of a curved line and rowers indicated by short lines; the combination of wheel and ship in this very primitive group is interesting and significant. Then in 1837 came to light the Ullerup stones, Northern Jutland. They are two slabs of a passage grave of the Stone Age. On these are seen the incised figures of a ship, an animal, a four-spoked wheel, a six-spoked wheel, a man * Neumann's more definite identification may be found in Urda,II,pp. 12-13. *7The other places mentioned are Smaalenene, Ringerike, Drammen, Kongsberg, Christiansand, Lister, Mandal, Romsdal and Stj^rdalen. A tracing of circles was reported from Hafslo, Inner Sogn, Norway, by J. Neumann in 1836, NTO, pp. 233-234. They appeared on a slab taken from a grave of which he says: "8 Alen under dens overflade (var) en firkantet Grav bedaekket med en Skifersteenshelle, hvorpaa var udgravetnogle temmelige regel- maessige Snirkler." I have not seen any published drawings of these and Nicolaysen does not mention it in his Norske Fornlevninger under Hafslo, pp. 456-458. 18 They are also shown in SkH, Plate A-B, figure 24, and in Revue Archlo- logique, I.e. p. 206.</page><page sequence="17">PLATE III • • o ® ® o I ••• .'. .'.'

A good drawing of these was made at the time by J. C. H. Steenstrup, which is reproduced in F. Magnussen's Runamo og Runerne*9 together with Steenstrup's description of them. The first publication of rock-tracings from Ostergotland, Sweden, also dates from 1837. They are those of Gars tad, Rystad Parish, District of Akerbo, drawings of which, furnished by Lektor Wallman of Linkoping, were published in Rafn's AnHqvUates Americanae of that year as Table XII (the two top left-hand figures). Better are those by C. F. Nordenskiold in Osigota Fornminnen, 1875.40 The latter differs considerably from the earlier one both in the shape and the relative position of figures. The prominent features are cups, four-spoked wheels, and a mass of angular hook-like objects. It is clear that these tracings contain both compound and reduced figures, and there is a square object made with cups, and a circle similarly made. Ships are here few, but it seems to me that the ships are actually represented symbolically by the hood-like objects corresponding to prows (and sterns) of ships. Finally the number of rock-tracings known within Sweden were materially increased in 1837 by L. Aberg's discoveries of fifteen such in Stangenas, Bohuslan, and in 1838 of four from the Hundred of Kville, Bohuslan. Drawings of all these were published by Aberg in the Annaler for 1838-39.41 They show a great variety of figures, some of them are among the finest of the Bohuslan collection. The unusual compound ones may be especially mentioned, as the concentric wheel-circles and the figure of three wheels connected by three furrows; the variety of ship forms is noteworthy. The Material at the Present Time. The foregoing survey takes us to the year 1839. It would be wearing to follow up further the individual discoveries. When Holmberg published his large illustrative work in 1848, which aimed to be com- plete,42 he was able to list 142 for Bohuslan, 18 for the rest of » 1841. Talbe VII, figures 5 and 6; description p. 519. 40 Pp. 34 and 103. 41 Plates V-VIII of the former, and IX-X of the latter. 41 It was, however, not quite complete.</page><page sequence="19">16 Sweden, 2 for Denmark and 2 for Norway. Of the 142 in Bohuslan 61 belonged to Tanum Parish alone. There are 28 for St&amp;ngenas, 19 for Sotenas, 16 for Vette, 10 for Kville, and 3 for Tunge. Also at the present time Tanum Parish comes first; it is almost literally true that here every rock that was suitable for the purpose has figures inscribed upon it. To-day there are known, and casts made of 267 numbered rock-tracings in the Division of Tanum, of which 265 are in Tanum Parish. We can get some idea of the mass of figures here found if we bear in mind that nearly every tracing is of a large group, com- monly as many as thirty or forty figures on one, in a number of cases over a hundred. In other parts of Bohuslan County there are numbered tracings as follows, taking the districts from the North: Vette, 16,48 Tanum, as above 267, Kville, 65,^ Sotenas and St&amp;ngenas together, 98, Tunge 3,43 and in South Bohuslan, that is south of Gullmaren Fjord, Tjorn, 25, farther south ca. 20. Here the southernmost rock-tracing so far found is one at Otterbacken, Askim Parish, District of Savedal, not far from the city of Gothenburg. The tracings here are almost exclusively of cups and ships, with a few foot-soles, but the three main types of ships are represented. The limita- tion to these three figures applies also to North Bohuslan as far up as Lane Hundred, with the foot-sole occupying a very prominent place. Thus in Langelanda Parish, Orust Island,44 there is a very unique one of fifteen soles and sixty-five cups. The complexity of the Tanum type is nowhere evidenced. Outside of Bohuslan, Sweden has, perhaps somewhat over fifty rock-tracings, for the most part in Ostergotland45 and Sk&amp;ne,46 with five in Upland,47 three in Sormland,48 seven in 48 So in SkH. I do not know of any later discoveries here. 44 In Ostra Division. « See especially Emil Hildebrand: AtfSv, II, pp. 417-432. 46 The interesting groups at Jjlrrestad are discussed by N. G.

Those in Upland are almost exclusively of ships, once with cups; there is one with five foot-soles and shoe-soles. In Sormland it is the same three figures mainly, likewise in Dalsland;51 in Varmland cups are ranged about ships.62 Finally a rock- tracing has recently been found also on the Island of Gothland58 and one on the Island of Oland. Only five actual tracings have been found in Denmark, but there is a considerable number of cupped stones from megalithic graves and from Bronze Age graves, mostly in Sealand and Laaland. All included, there were 56 known in 1875; they are listed and described by H. Petersen in AafnO. for that year. Outside of North Bohuslan, the adjacent county of Smaal- enene in Norway has by far the largest number. There are here 144 rock-tracings found in a relatively small area in the region of Sarpsborg to Fredrikshald. One hundred and thirty of these were discovered and copied by Martin Arneson in 1872- 1873. In their complexity they stand nearest to those of North Bohuslan; human figures with upraised swords, concentric cir- cles and various kinds of compound figures are conspicuous. In 1873 Oluf Rygh published a complete list of all definitely established rock- tracings in Norway; they were described and locality given but he gave no illustrations. The list numbers 164. A list published by A. L. Coll in 1901 augmented this to *9 At Kinnekulle especially. See, e. g., Emil Ekhoff : SvfT, VII, pp. 102- 126. The last discovery here is discussed by Marta Lejonhufvud in Fornv&amp;n- nen, 1908, pp. 87-92. In Faglum Parish there is a remarkable tracing of seventy-four foot soles and thirteen bowls, Fornvantien, 1911, pp. 196-203, described by Bror Schnittger. 10 Discovered by Brunius. 11 Those in Dalsland, as shown in SkH are very irregular and indefinite. I can find no later reproductions of them. M The cupped stones of Sormland show mainly masses of cups on a group of stones from Bronze Age graves. The single group from Smaland, Berge Parish, near Bergsjo, is reproduced in Fornv&amp;nnen, 1909. M This was an exceedingly interesting discovery. Holmberg once said that there were rock-tracings in Oland and Gothland, something that Brunius denied. They are illustrated and discussed by Fredrik Nordin in Fornv&amp;nnen 1911, pp. 144-152.</page><page sequence="22">18 176 as numbered; one of these, however, (number 169) repre- sents eight groups at Melung, Island of Aamoen, a little north of Stavanger, making the total of 183, less numbers 175-176 which appear to be of purely North Scandinavian type; hence actually 181. In recent years many new ones have been found in North Trondhjem Province, especially in Skatval Parish, Stjjrfrdalen.54 The total number for Norway, if I am not mis- taken, is at the present time 208, and the northernmost limit of rock-tracings in Norway so far found is Tjotta Parish in Nord- land. Here on the islands of L0v0 and Flat0 several were investigated and reported by K. Rygh in 1908; they are of numerous figures and considerable variety, including a double spiral enclosed in a flexed ring. Of the 208 rock- tracings in Nor- way, then, 144 are in Smaalenene, 11 in the rest of Eastern Norway (in districts about the Christiania Fjord), 20 in Western Norway, and S3 in Northern Norway (Nordm^re to Nordland).66 The last discovery comes from Rykkje, in Kvam, Hardanger.66 Fundamental Features and Local Developments. It has been indicated above that there is a considerable difference between the sculpturings of the different regions. There are certain out- standing features in the body of configurations as a whole; there are other things that are in the nature of departures from these. There are some things that are fundamental, evidenced from the examples in the megalithic graves, in the early Bronze Age graves also, from the simple groups everywhere, and as elements present extensively in the regions having complex groups. A view of the territory as a whole seems to suggest the following six divisions classified according to the general character of the material in them: 1. The Sk&amp;ne-Blekinge zone, with Denmark. The charac- 64 The last discovery here was reported and described by K. Rygh in VSS, Tr., 1914, pp. 1-8; also well illustrated. 66 These are treated separately by K. Rygh in VSS, Tr., 1909, pp. 1-35.

Bjjzfrn.</page><page sequence="23">19 ter is that of a general primitiveness, to which stones from the Kivik monument form, in a measure, an exception. South Sm&amp;land with one figure group belongs here. 2. Southern Bohuslan, Gothenburg, V&amp;stergdtland. Also almost exclusively certain limited figures; but a massing of these: the foot-sole occupies a prominent place. Dalsland and Varmland, with four tracings, may be included here. 3. North Bohuslan-Smaalenene. From Gullmaren in the South to Sandesund in the North. A region showing a great complexity of figures and the massing of a variety of figures on the same rock. Numerous animals, human beings, armed and unarmed, are conspicuous. Of the total number of ca. 750 rock-tracings (groups) ca. 595 belong here. 4. Ostergotland-Sormland- Upland. The chief development is in Ostergotland, where the interest centers around the ship figures. Gothland and Oland belong here. 5. Western Norway and Southern Norway (other than Smaalenene). The Norwegian coast from Sandesund to Roms- dalsfjorden. Primitive figures, but with these the prominence of compound circle and spiral forms are at once noticeable. 6. Trondhjem Provinces and Nordland. A northern region showing a beginning of the variety of the Smaalenene type of figures. To discuss the problems that suggest themselves here does not, however, come within the scope of this survey. Possibly on a later occasion I may be able to do so in connection with a review of recent views. In the meantime I hope that the above pages will serve to gain some interest, also among English speaking students, here in America, for these monuments from ancient Scandinavian times. Many of the figures are perplexing, and perhaps not capable of solution at this late date. But some of the figures have world- wide parallels, as have even some of the compound figures made up of these. And they are found, especially, in all parts of the Indo-European world, though nowhere else assuming such prominence as in the North. The earliest examples in the North go back to the period of the dolmens. The latest examples belong probably to the close of the Bronze Age. Hence they range over a period of ca. 2,000</page><page sequence="24">20 years. The real problem, as I see it is, in the first place, what was the original meaning or purpose of the cups? and, in the second place, what is the meaning of the combination of cup- and wheel-figures, in their later development? Rock Sculpturings in Other Countries. Attention has long ago been called to the fact of the existence of sculpturings of rock-tracing type in Stone Age and Bronze Age graves and on rocks in the open in other countries. They are found in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Northern Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Upper Austria, Bohemia, and India.57 In most cases they consist of groupings of a limited number of figures, but in some regions the character of the carvings is much more complex. The variety of the Scandinavian rock-tracings is, however, nowhere met with. Particularly in the develop- ment of the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures the rock tracings of the North are distinguished from those of other regions. The development of anthropomorphic gods (through zSomorphic deities) from primitive nature worship may have taken place earliest in the North. However, the question of the absolute chronology of the anthropomorphic figures enters here. The more primitive character of such monuments in the rest of Europe may have its explanation in the fact that elsewhere they belong for the most part to the end of the Stone Age and the beginning of the Bronze Age, whereas in the Scandina- vian North, while they begin, in the last centuries of the Age of Stone, the major portion of the rock-tracings probably belongs to the middle periods of the Bronze Age (1 600-800) ,58 Rock Sculpturings in England and Scotland. The reader will perhaps welcome a note on the nature and extent of the sculp- tures of England and Scotland. According to published listings there were 348 sculptured stones in the United Kingdom known in 1882. 69 Of these fully one-half were from cists, urns, cairns, 67 1 disregard here the cup carvings of the American Indians. 61 The accompanying Plates III and IV will illustrate the variety of bowl and wheel figures and the development of zoomorphic and finally anthropo- morphic sculpturings. •• Archaologia, LXI, Part 2, p. 373, and Pr .

Figures from Cup-and-Ring Sculptures of England and Scotland</page><page sequence="26">21 stone circles, cromlechs, etc., i. e., they are associated with various periods of ancient sepulture. I note however, that fifty-seven of those numbered are found on natural rock sur- faces, as commonly in Norway and Sweden. In England, the principal home of figured rocks and stones of the type in question is in Yorkshire and Northumberland. The first systematic presentation of the subject for Eng- land was, as far as I can find, that of George Tate: The Ancient British Sculptured Rocks of Northumberland and the Eastern Borders.60 There are cups, rings with central cups, and complicated figures with radial grooves; grooves enclosing rows or irregularly placed cups are characteristic. There are, further, concentric circles around a central cup, in many cases there is a double radial channel with transverse bars, forming a ladder-like figure joined to the circle figure. A fine example of this kind of a configuration is that of the Panorama Stone at Ilkley, in the dale country of Northwestern Yorkshire.61 The Northumberland sculptures numbered in 1865 fifty-three with about 350 figures, all of them more or less connected with ancient British remains.62 Of the 53 stones, four were from the covers of cists, four others are assumed to be from covers of cists, and two were within a few yards of barrows beneath which are similar sepulchral chambers. The others are shown to be from within or near ancient habitations. It will be noted that a larger number are connected with habitations than with sepulture. In the Parish of Kilburn, Yorkshire, more than twenty stones were found with round and oval cup-markings, connected sometimes by wide and shallow grooves.63 From barrow nr. 245 in the Parish of Folkton, Yorkshire, were taken in connection with examinations in 1866-68, three chalk objects with carved figures, regarding which I quote William Green- welFs words: "Behind the head and touching it was an object 60 Published at Alnwick, 1865.

All three are round and solid (formed like a round box, says Green well) ; the top shows in all three cases series of concentric circles. The largest ball has a figure of five concentric circles; projecting from the outside of this figure are four triangular points. We seem to have here again the flaming disk, with five circles. Cf. similar sun-symbols on Scandinavian rock-tracings. See Plate III. The middle sized object has four series of concentric circles. The smallest has a figure which is like the middle figure in the bottom row of Plate V here shown, except that instead of three there are two central groups of concentric rings. In Scotland cup and ring sculptures have been found near Ratho, Edinburghshire, at Moncrieff south of Perth, at Balv- raid and Clava, Invernesshire, at Dunbar, East Lothian, at Ardkeiling, Elginshire, at Laws, Forfarshire, at Conchieton, Borgue, in Kirkcudbright (here one cup on each of two stones taken from a cairn), and especially at Auchnabreach, Carnban, Argyleshire; further also Aberdeenshire, Banff, Ross, Sutherland, Orkney, other places in Perthshire and Forfar besides those named, in Ayrshire, Dumfries, Roxburgh, Dumbarton, Peebles, and Wigtown, and finally in the caves of East Wemyss, Fife- shire. The first seven of these are from dolmens, stone circles, and passage-graves, some are from monoliths; a number appear on isolated stones; and especially in Argyle on rocks in situ; they are all markings of numerous cups, round and oval. Those from the caves of East Wemyss are much more elaborate, and remind one strangely of some of the Swedish tracings.65 There are cupped rings, with closed and open rings, rings connected by grooves, large circles joined to a tree-like figure, a leftward branch of which ends in four lateral branches and a central squarish figure, a "spectacle ornament " M Archaologia, LII, Part 2, p. 14. * They are treated by John Patrick m article entitled "The Sculptured Caves of East Wemyss'* in The Reliquary and Illustrated Archaologist, Vols.

The ball is of clay slate, three inches in diameter and has four round projecting knobs, one being plain, the other three ornamented. They are repro- duced on pp. 102-3 of The Reliquary, vol. Ill, with discussion, to which I am indebted for the facts here given. One of the ornamented faces shows four groups of concentric circles, and the second three central double spirals enclosed in a series of concentric trefoils. The third face has concentric spirals, in the center curved parallel lines running out from this and along the edge, the space between being filled in by chevrons. On the second ball the whole surface outside the three circles is filled in with sixteen trefoils. The ball in question is dated as of the Bronze Age; another similar ball found at Walston, Lanark, is regarded as belonging to the early Iron Age. The ball here spoken of is the finest specimen of a group of ca. 100 similar balls found in (chiefly northeastern) Scotland. One has been found in Ireland. The raised faces number variously from four to fifteen, symmetrically arranged with depressions between each. Plate V will show the principal figures occurring in the English-Scottish sculpturings. George T. t lom University of Illinois May 23, 1921. 86 The so-called cresset stones have been found in Cornwall, Cumberland, Dorset, Monmouthshire, Yorkshire, and elsewhere. One of the stones has a cup and a long groove on the bottom; the four pits in its upper side are nipple- shaped.
