This volume is a Festschrift for the seventieth birthday of Ellen Hickmann, who has been a central figure in the field of music archaeology for several decades. It includes 38 papers from the third symposi um of the International Study Group on Music Archae ology held at Michaelstein Monastery in 2002, with an additional six papers dedicated to Ellen Hickmann. Divided into five sections, the contributions discuss: universals of ancient music; methodologies of music archaeology; traditions and cultural memory; musical instruments in traditional contexts and constructions; written evidence. The case studies cover a broad geo graphical range, encompassing the Near East, Egypt, Greece, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Papers are in English with German summaries, or vice versa. In addition, a short biography of Ellen Hick mann by Rüdiger Schumacher, and a bibliography of her work, is included. A selection of papers will be reviewed individually in the order and category in which they appear in the publication. The reviewers are Richard Dumbrill and Sam Mirelman, signing RD and SM respectively. I - Prerequisites: Universals in Music (Gen eral and Special Problems) Eckart Altenmüller, Singen - die Ursprache? Zur Evolution and Hirnphysiologie des Gesangs. The au thor has once more revived the old 'chicken or egg' debate. With early man the anatomy and physiology of sound producing organs, their accessories and their classification as either instruments or implements in respect of the function of the one or of the other, as having the fundamental purpose of producing either speech or song is axiomatic should one assume that the sounds first emitted could at all be qualified either as speech or as song. But in fact might it not have been grunt which came first - neither speech nor song. Then it was at a much later period when larynxes, sinuses and other sound appendages developed in rela tion to the intellectual psychogenetic demands of an improved thinking man that grunt organized itself into palaeo-linguistic/melodic systems or patterns and that as a consequence LV-speech could segregate itself Archiv für Orientforschung 52 (2011)</page><page sequence="2">368 Rezensionen from Ur-song, or inversely. It is from that period that Professor Dr. Altenmüller's researches in neuro-ana tomic/physiologic brain activity during singing and speaking sequences become of specific interest to musicology. His findings are particularly enlightening in his Fig. 2 where tomographic scans show different sectors of responsiveness according to stimuli of either singing or speech activities on a given subject and in given circumstances. Altenmüller's work is just the beginning of a new approach of a science which will certainly shake the basis of comfortable assumptions in the field of the anatomy, physiology and psycholo gy in the development of human mechanisms for the purpose of sound emission and of the nature of abili ties to perceive sound. RD Reinhard Kopiez, From Toddler's Headturn to Tchaikovsky and Haydn. A Review of Studies on Per formances for so-called Natural Musical Intervals. This paper examines the issue of 'natural' musical intervals in human perception. Kopiez discusses 'bot tom-up' and 'top-down' processes. 'Bottom-up' meth ods of analysing musical perception, where psycho physiological processes are treated independently from learning processes or listening experience, are con trasted with 'top-down' methods, where knowledge and expectation are paramount. Kopiez applies a healthy degree of criticism to existing studies of music percep tion, successfully illustrating the limitations inherent in methodology and interpretation of results. As Kop iez states, the area of cultural experience remains unexplored in his paper. Kopiez has succeeded in raising issues and problems inherent in this area of research. It is hoped that this study will form the basis of a comprehensive treatment of the subject. SM Eleanora Rocconi, Colours in Music. Metaphoric Musical Language in Greek Antiquity. The author analyses the metaphorical use of Greek in musical description and musical terminology. Rocconi claims that the Greeks had a synaesthetic association between music and colour. The first examples given are the associations of white with 'brightness', grey with 'dull ness' and black with 'imperceptibility'. These adjec tives are interpreted by Rocconi to indicate degrees of resonance. One can easily see widespread parallels here with other languages, such as modern English. Contemporary musicians routinely describe particular harmonic, instrumental or vocal qualities with adjec tives such as 'bright' and 'dull'. Therefore, the ques tion arises whether this feature is universal, or partic ular to ancient Greece. Furthermore, the precise mean ings of these adjectives, as they are used in Greece, remain unclear from the texts. Rocconi devotes a large portion of the article to a discussion of the terms 'chroma' and 'chroa\ Here, Rocconi's discussion of the development of these terms from metaphor into musical theory, is enlightening. However, there is a tendency to offer extensive quotations from sources without sufficient discussion and explication. It is undeniable that colouristic metaphors played an im portant role in ancient Greek musical terminology. Rocconi has offered an interpretation of some key terms which found their way into music theory; it would also be desirable to determine the precise nature of metaphors which never became theoretical, if such an enterprise is feasible. SM Anna K. Boshnakova, "From the Visible to the Invisible" - Musical Metaphysics from the 6"' and 5"' Centuries B.C. Here Boshnakova attempts at defining musical metaphysics by means of solving a riddle displayed as an 'open image', as she puts it, of a Panathenaic amphora where the visible has its invisi ble equation. The visible appears as the depiction of a young man whose invisible alter ego is Eros as his symbol, and also as the autos, the visible twin of the invisible, Pindar's aionos eidolon. Thus Eros is psyche and Boshnakova debates of this connection in terms of a narrative where mousike stands as the highest state of philosophy and where aulos and lyre have also their own symbols and metaphors. All of this is magisteri ally exposed with further debates about Eros being the soul of the philosopher leading the reader to the relevance of all of this with Classical Greek musical theory. She concludes in attesting that the Panathenaic amphora which she chose in illustration of her disqui sition is a brilliant illustration of the metaphysical and mystical ideas from contemporary Pythagorean philo sophical doctrine when music was the subject of phil osophical reflection and provided a real escape from the burden of becoming. There is a problem, however, in that the hare standing at the foot of the symbol of the invisible could well be Orion's and not Eros'. But would this change much of the riddle's purpose seems irrelevant since the aim, whether with Eros or Orion, is the cause of a philosophical reflection towards which Boshnakova has led us. RD II - Basics and Methods in Archaeology / Music Archaeology Thomas Götzelt, Schöne alte Weif. Archäologie beobachtet. Götzelt has produced an interesting disser tation stemming from Niklas Luhmann's concept of his 'Systems Theory' and suggests the acceptation of the autonomy of understanding focusing on communi cation and distinctions by observers whose communi cations structure their lives. His thesis is the debate of the method in archaeology for the discrimination of artefacts which may or not end up in the record. The second part is about the treatment of finds in relation to the concept of origins and is almost antithetic. A good debate between ontology and epistemology. RD</page><page sequence="3">Rezensionen 369 Graeme Lawson, Music, Intentionality and Tradi tion: Identifying Purpose, and Continuity of Purpose, in the Music-archaeological Record. This paper pro ceeds from a discussion of 'megalithic' acoustics. The current trend to examine man-made or 'natural' large scale structures, such as buildings or caves, for their acoustic properties, raises questions concerning inten tionality. Were the acoustic properties of these struc tures utilised and/or designed by humans, or are these properties incidental? Lawson examines this funda mental problem of music-archaeology using case stud ies, involving what are presumed to be instrumental artefacts and music-related sites. Lawson uses these case studies to examine issues of methodology, which may be applied to the study of intentionality and tradition in artefacts or sites in general. The instrumental case studies involve early Medi eval lyres from northern Europe, and European box wood pan-pipes, which are shown to demonstrate tra ditions of construction or tuning. Three case-studies of sites in Medieval England and Germany, two of which are clearly sites of instrument-manufacture, are used to demonstrate elements of tradition and continuity in the wider context. These case-studies, which are chosen for their 'ordinariness' are presented as a lucid and convincing demonstration of methodologies which can be applied to several areas of music-archaeology. As Lawson admits, problems arise the further back in time one goes. From the Bronze Age and beyond, we cross into a cultural realm which can be impenetrable from our contemporary perspective. Lawson's study features a detailed and careful examination of issues, which are certainly relevant to the study of 'megalith ic' acoustics, as well as the wider field of music archaeology. SM Alexandra von Lieven, Music Archaeology - Music Philology. Sources on Ancient Egyptian Music and Their Inherent Problems. Von Lieven's paper has firstly the purpose of encouraging Egyptologists to a better understanding of the musical life of the ancient Egyptians and secondly that they too should encourage the participation of musicologists in the apprehension of the artefacts, of the iconography and of the textual evidence as sources. Artefacts as sources in Egyptolo gy present a problem in that for the most they are mortuary and as such only represent part of life. The presence of musical instruments does not necessarily mean that either they belonged to the person buried in the tomb, or that they were only used as symbolic funerary elements and so forth. The iconographic sourc es must be taken cum grano salis because one cannot assume that even the most talented of funerary artists was also a skilled organologist and that as a conse quence any of his instrumental depictions equated to what the instrument was in reality, to scale. With textual evidence as sources it is another matter in the sense that an Egypto-philologist might not always, if at all, understand a philological value which would be immediately evident to a musicologist gifted with Egyptology. Therefore it is evident that more collabo ration is needed between them for the benefit of all. Then there is the matter of the shameful practice of 'intellectual protectionism' consisting in intently ob nubilating matters so as to discourage efforts of musi cologists, just to keep it all in the family. RD/SM Julio Mendivil, Flutes and Food for the Ancestors: From the Tradition of Discoveries to the Discovery of Traditions in Music Archaeology. This paper presents a remarkable case for cultural continuity from pre Hispanic times until the present, in the case of deer skull flutes in the Sicuani of Colombia. Using an early 17th century iconographic source, along with an ac companying text, Mendivil convincingly disproves earlier theories concerning the identity of the instru ment depicted. However, the textile from Wari, about 1000 years old, seems less convincing as an icono graphic source. Here, the images are highly stylised, and it does not seem obvious that deer-skull flutes are represented. Mendivil makes a brief attempt to com pare and contrast the usage and significance of the instrument in contemporary and historical sources. The second half of the article is concerned with an 'espistemological reversal', where music archaeology is considered as a field where its importance lies in its elucidation of contemporary musical cultures, as op posed to the 'traditional' concern with a discovery of the past. There is no problem with this approach. However, it would be preferable to demonstrate this position in the case study of the article, through great er ethnographic detail, and a more extensive consider ation of some of the extraordinary connections which can be made between contemporary and historical sources. SM Bruno Nettl, Some Questions on the Relationship of Music Archaeology and Ethnomusicology. Informal Comments on Constructing the Past from the Present. The author offers views on the field of music archae ology, from the perspective of an established eth nomusicologist. Nettl sees the concerns of music archaeology as of particular relevance to 'the kind of ethnomusicology most closely related to socio-cultural anthropology'. The study of musical culture can be pursued through either fieldwork, or archeological and historical records. However, there are indeed funda mental differences in methodology and interpretation which must be considered. Nettl makes various impor tant observations which are relevant to these closely related fields of research, and their areas of overlap and interaction. One cannot argue with Nettl's con cerns regarding music-archaeology's utilisation of material which is frequently isolated and fragmentary. Similarly, one can only agree that we have limited</page><page sequence="4">370 Rezensionen knowledge regarding the context and reception of ancient musical cultures. However, it must be borne in mind that the questions Nettl asks are those which are central to ethnomusicology, not music archaeology. For example, reception is fundamental to current eth nomusicology, and generally of less concern to music archaeology. On the other hand, historical organology is central to music archaeology, and generally less central to the concerns of ethnomusicology. SM III -Traditions and Cultural Memory III. 1 - Near and Middle East, Indonesia, Australia Amnon Shiloah, The Beginning of Things: Theories of Origins in Arabic and Hebrew Sources. This paper focuses on notions of musical origins which stem from Genesis Chapter 4. Yubal, 'the father of all those who play the kinnor and cuggav' was the son of Lamech, who was descended from Cain. Underlying Jewish, Muslim and Ethiopian Christian traditions, Shiloah demonstrates an association of music with Cain's prog eny, and music's associated moral degradation. Shi loah 's sources focus particularly on Arabic writings, from the 9lh century until the 19th century, including not only Muslim writings but also the Ethiopian Chris tian Book of Adam and Eve. Hebrew sources are confined to the Bible and Midrashim. It would be particularly enlightening to compare the development of this tradition in Muslim, Jewish and Christian texts, into the modern era. Instead Shiloah concentrates on the Muslim tradition, perhaps due to the undeniable fervour with which Muslim authorities have often attempted to suppress music, with the justification of music's disreputable descendancy. Muslim sources are also an exceptionally rich pool from which fantastic traditions concerning music can be found. One 10th century Muslim source claims Lamech, not Yubal, as the inventor of music. In this story of music's creation, Lamech's invention of the cüd is described as an anthropomorphic substitution of Lamech's deceased son. The sources and themes which are touched upon in this article are explored in greater depth in the author's various seminal publications, which have ap peared over the last forty years. SM Monika Schuol, Die Tradierung von Musik im ana tolischen Raum - Mündlichkeit versus Schriftlichkeif. The author examines issues of musical transmission in 2nd millenium BC sources from Anatolia. As Schuol states, the Hittites adopted many features of the indig enous Hattic culture. The influence of Hattic language and culture is particularly evident in Hittite ritual texts, where instructions involving music are given. Many names of musical instruments and cultic person nel are Hattic. Archaeological finds including cymbals provide evidence of musical activity in Anatolia be fore the arrival of the Hittites, which is probably Hattic. The instructions in ritual texts for antiphonal singing (more precisely, 'responsorial' singing) is de scribed by Schuol as a Hattic trait. Antiphonal or responsorial singing was, indeed, widespread in the ancient Near East. Whether this musical practice is a distinctive Hattic trait may be difficult to prove at present, although the existence of Hattic influence in the Hittite cult is undeniable. Schuol's discussion of oral transmission argues for the Hattic background to the Hittite cults. Schuol favours theories which claim that knowledge is passed down accurately through the centuries. Thus, Hittite musical culture may have recorded Hattic traditions which were many centuries old at the time of the Hittite texts' presumed dates of composition. Here, Schuol follows the work of Assmann regarding oral transmission. Schuol's argument is not implausible, although it would benefit from further discussion of the topic of oral transmission, and its various theories. SM Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, Memorizing the Names of Things, from Oral to Written: Mesopotamian Musical Instruments. Kilmer hypothesises that the methodolo gy of classification with which implements and instru ments were written down in the great Sumerian and Akkadian lexical texts, especially with HAR-ra = hu bullu, would be the consequence of mnemonics de vised in Mesopotamian pre-literate times for the pur pose of classification. However the premise is disput able on the ground of teleology since the memorizing of items for the purpose of their classification under the form of lists could only have been the consequence of a post-literate concept. Indeed the concept of listing cannot conceivably exist without the ability to write: They made lists because they could write things down on a medium which lent itself to listing and the categorisation of items of similar shape or materials of which they are made is axiomatically the consequence of their acrography rather than of their morphology. The acrography is the consequence of the determina tive which in turn is the consequence of the nature of the object of the determinative, and in the absence of an alphabetic system, the acrographic semasiography was the only practical scribal device for listing any thing. Of course one may argue that the determinative is to some extent the reflection of the morphology of the item but it will be found that in most cases it is only part of the item which inherits the determinative and that this is not sufficient to prove that a system of pre-literary mnemonics for the purpose of listing exist ed. Kilmer goes even further in professing that the urge Mesopotamians would have had of transcribing theo retical materials they had memorised in pre-literary times only arose ca. 1900 B.C.E., without giving any</page><page sequence="5">Rezensionen 371 sources for it. The fact that the oldest theoretical text (UET VI, 74) unearthed so far dates from about 1850 BC and that we have not yet found older ones is not evidence that they did not exist. Indeed out of over one million tablets excavated to this day, less than ten refer to music theory. The presence of the long neck lute in the list should have been sufficient enough an indicator against her hypothesis in the light that its design implies the understanding of mathematical ratios that are neces sary to approportionate frets or fret marks on the neck of the instrument and that this would not have been possible in the absence of a writing system. RD Kilmer's paper focuses on the Sumerian-Akkadian lexical list HAR-ra = hubullu in its first millennium recension. Kilmer's discussion describes methods of categorisation which are demonstrated in the text, proceeding from raw materials, to objects made from the materials, organised according to function, con tent, size and colour. A brief discussion of related texts follows, highlighting (in an unpublished tablet) an example of the categorisation of musical instru ments among other objects due to the shared use of cuneiform signs, as opposed to the objects' common physical characteristics. All this information is well presented, although more detail would be desirable. Nevertheless, there is no discussion of the context and function of these texts. Without discussion, Kilmer implies that these lexical texts reveal musical knowl edge; it may be argued that the texts reveal methods of scribal training instead. In fact, an argument can be made that these texts represent musical knowledge, as music formed an important part of the scribal curric ulum.1 But no argument is attempted here. Similarly, the discussion of oral transmission, with reference to these texts, is very brief. Kilmer's theories regarding, for example, the knowledge of instrument makers in pre-literate times, is not supported with reference to any sources. Kilmer's argument would benefit from detailed study of earlier recensions of HAR-ra = hubullu, from the Old Babylonian period onwards. The subject matter requires a more detailed treatment. It is hoped that Kilmer, who has made significant contributions to this field in the past, will develop this topic in future research. SM Regina Randhofer, Von zerstörten Städten und ster benden Göttern. Klage als Erinnerungsfigur des Alten Orient. In the general context of the lament form, Randhofer establishes a unique parallel between the liturgical repertory of the Jewish Babylonian tradition particularly with regard to the funeral service of tish'ah be-av and its equation with the Christian Syrian takheshfotho. Her Study is a good explanatory model based on the anthropological, cultural and historical shared sources for both forms. RD Rüdiger Schumacher, Epics as a Cultural Memory in Bali (Indonesia). Schumacher's thesis is about the relevance in the analysis of archaeological finds for the purpose of the understanding of orally transmitted materials such as the epic. His assessment proceeds in three steps which include the archaeological evidence; the literary heritage and the contemporary performance, in a Balinese society which remains the only predomi nant Hinduistic society in Southeast Asia. Schumacher's archaeological evidence resides in that the early epic tradition in Bali is indirect and only derived from secondary sources such as the iconogra phy and the epigraphy and takes for paradigm a stone relief dated around 800 AD portraying the famous Boddhisattwa Maitreya holding a manuscript, and phil ological evidence with Old Balinese from the 9lh cen tury up to copper plate inscriptions in both Old Bal inese and Old Javanese dated precisely from 1181. However, the epigraphy does not provide us with any word for 'poet' and the reason for this might be that this specific occupation would not have been a com monly accepted craft. Schumacher follows by the con tribution of the literary heritage and with the oral performance in contemporary Bali from which he concludes that Old Javanese and Balinese epic forms have made it, to a certain extent, to this day in relation to the archaeological evidence. RD Udo Will, Oral Memory in Australian Aboriginal Song Performance and the Parry-Kirk Debate: a Cog nitive Ethnomusicological Perspective. Will examines the oral transmission of music using a cognitive ap proach. Fieldwork conducted in the 20lh century has shown that Australian Aboriginal song is transmitted with a high degree of accuracy. Will examines aspects of the songs' textual and melodic structures, as well as their instrumental accompaniment, in order to explore the concept of formula. He connects the concept of formula with an analysis of psychological and neuro logical processes, in an attempt to explain the cogni tive processes underlying oral transmission. As Will concludes, it does seem plausible that habit learning, motor learning, sensory motor control, pattern extrac tion and serial pattern recall are factors in oral trans mission. It would be facile to criticise the premiss of Will's methodology, as treating humans like mechan isms, and divorcing transmission from context. In stead, cognitive approaches should be taken into ac count as one factor among many, which can be used to explore the highly complex topic of oral transmission.

These flutes have been used continuously from the 16th cen tury until the present, for hunting the Eurasian golden plover. The bird-call is imitated with the instrument, and the bird/s are caught with nets. Excavated samples made of bone, along with samples in use and extant above ground (usually made of wood) are discussed in detail, along with iconography and textual sources. The instruments themselves were and are made almost exclusively by amateurs, revealing a distinct culture, including peculiar terminology for instrument parts. This account is of considerable interest, firstly in the use of these flutes, and secondly in the description of a largely neglected amateur tradition of music-making and musical instrument construction. SM Joachim Schween, Verehrt und mißbraucht. Zur Rezeptionsgeschichte der bronzezeitlichen Luren im 19. und 20. Jahrundert. Schween's paper is a short history of the lur of its first exhumation and of its use as a socio-political symbol in the nineteenth and twen tieth centuries especially with regard to the Third Reich's claim to Scandinavia as an elemental part of the Germanic territory. In 1797 when Ole Petersen, farming in the small moorland of Brudevaelte un earthed the remains of six late bronze age lur little did he know that he had generated a very interesting and unique saga in relation to the socio-political symboli cal value of the items. A few decades later, in 1843, these horns attracted the attention of the Tsar's librar ian, a certain de Gille, who visited King Christian the Vllth of Denmark; then Frederick the Vllth ordered replicae, a copy of which he offered to Napoleon the Third. Schween continues with the debate of the posi tion in which the instrument would have been played, and even relates of attempts at using them polyphoni cally. The late nineteenth century even witnessed the apparition of lure poetics as well as its rendition in the plastic arts. This even spread to butter advertising still remaining to this day with the well known 'Lurpak'. In 1911 Germany, the philologist Oscar Butcher deliv ered a lecture in Koblenz having for his premise that the lur was an all Germanic instrument. Ernest Guido Naumann, curator of the collection of early instru ments in Berlin, composed music in support of this outrageous assumption. Schween writes about early replicae of the instrument. During the twenties and thirties, it was Denmark's turn to nationalise the in strument. Then Schween writes of its situation during the Second World War and then from 1945 to the present as a lur without ideology. RD John Purser, Listening to Picts. This paper general ly introduces the Picts; their toponyms; their three main stylistic classes; the musical instruments depict ed; an analysis of the river Erne instrument and its reconstruction. There is far too little iconographic material let alone textual and archaeological evidence to build up anything substantial. Line drawings of the instruments should have been produced for the pur pose of classification and comparative organological studies. RD John Curtis Franklin, Structural Sympathies in An cient Greek and South-Slavic Heroic Song. Franklin's premise for ascribing survival of ancient Greek song culture into South-Slavic heroic song mainly relies on the geographic proximity of both cultures and on that oral compositions survive best in a context of illitera cy implying that whilst the form has not survived well in Greece, it would have under the form of the Serbo Croat epic. Franklin further attests that the cement binding-up his assumptions is that both cultures share an Indo-European, and even a Pre-Indo-European lin guistic ancestry also shared with Germanic; Italic; Latin; Indo-Iranian; Sanskrit; Old Persian; Avestan; Baltic and Albanian, and extinct linguistic ancestry with Hittite; Luwian; Lydian; Tocharian; Thracian; Phrygian and Illyrian. But then what of the other unmentioned languages such as Hurrian, and then what about dispersion and influences. May it be asked, therefore, if it is only linguistic and geographic prox imities and affinities between Greece and South-Sla vonic cultures which are of any relevance without having to add the unnecessary burden of the proto- and Indo-European linguistic soup. Then Franklin introduces Indo-European metrics of which he says that ancient Indie, Greek and South Slavic are so specific that independent development is impossible - another radical assertion, one would say. The paragraph is fully documented with features which are shared between them in their metricity such as the dactylic hexameter of ancient Greek epic verse with the Serbo-Croatian 'diseterac', a ten syllabic heroic metre being lstichic\ i.e. a finite metrical grouping repeated ad infinitum. Follows another learned para graph on the Indo-European 'melodies' and the com parison with South-Slavonic heroic song where Frank lin disperses further from Hittite to Thrace, to philol ogy where he exposes a word play of nomos meaning both 'song' and 'law', with Herodotus' mention of ritual incantations and theogonic songs of the Magi leading into the Avesta of Zoroaster which like the Rgveda have very ancient elements of the Indo-Iranian proto-culture. Franklin goes further in his fifth para graph with Text, Time and Tone: The Theory of Indo European Accent Melody where he quotes Nettl: '// music can be analysed with methods that can be also applied to language, then we should be able to make parallel studies of the simultaneously appearing struc tures of text and music. In other words, methods that can be applied to both structures are the ones that ought to be first tried in a study of the relationship'. Franklin concludes that melodic traditions: Vedic;</page><page sequence="7">Rezensionen 373 Homeric and Serbo-Croatian can rightfully claim a common, if remote, historical foundation. There is, as he says, no question of comparing or reconstructing actual melodies and that his purpose is method rather than content with which we shall all thankfully agree. RD III.3 - Latin America Anna Gruszczyriska-Ziöikowska, Masculine Musi cal Instruments in the Andean Tradition. The author's introduction is that as a consequence of the Andean confrontation with the colonizing European culture in the 16lh and 17th centuries, and having for subsequence that Andean written sources appear only about the same period, researches into the Andean musical tradi tion should be undertaken with the appropriate speci ficity in its historical, ethnographic and archaeological contexts. We are reminded, to that effect, that whilst the antara pan-pipes and the kena flute are dated as early as the 5th millennium in the Andean instrumen tarium, chordophones were only introduced with the European colonization. It is at that time when four voice polyphony mingles with the Kechua language, as reported by Juan Perez Bocanegra in 1631. The author refers her paper to Olsen's model in that its focal point is the musical knowledge, the objective of the enquiry which leads towards four types of process es, namely the archaeological, the iconographic, the historiographic and the ethnologic. Enlightened in this respect, the author analyses her observation that all wind instruments at all periods and circumstances of the Andean culture are played by men. Her point of departure is a depiction on a Nasca culture vessel (6th BC to 6th AD) of a well known scene analyzed by Raoul d'Harcourt almost 70 years ago and it is one's privilege to allow the reader to discover for them selves the quality of Anna Gruszczyriska-Ziölkows ka's expertise without any further interference with it. RD Anna Gruszczynska-Ziolkowska's paper follows Dale Olsen's methodology of music-archaeological research. The four procedures are the archaeological process, the music iconographic process, the historio graphic process, and lastly, ethnographic analogy. Gruszcyriska-Ziöikowska succeeds in demonstrating the association of wind instruments with males, and the less consistent association of women with drums, at least in the archaeological and historical record. It is in the area of ethnographic analogy that this study is lacking, both in the level of detail and its discussion. As the author acknowledges, the area of ethnographic analogy is both difficult, and particularly problematic in the case of Hispanic South America. Perhaps this aspect of Dale Olsen's methodology is also not as essential to Gruszcynska-Ziolkowska's study as she seems to suggest. Neverthelesss, it would be revealing to find evidence in ethnographic fieldwork which would prove continuity in these aspects of sex/gender and its relation to musical instruments in the Andean tradi tion. SM Amd Adje Both, Shell Trumpets in Mesoamerica. Music-Archaeological Evidence and Living Tradition. Both introduces firstly archaeological evidence from three distinct periods, namely Teotihuacan, Classic Maya and Late Post Classic Aztec, and secondly living tradition with shells played by contemporary ethnic groups of the Huichol and the Maya-Lacandon. Both derives that whilst both Huichol and Maya-Lacandon have never been in contact with each other in their respective histories, comparable aspects in their usage of shells tend to indicate that Prehispanic traditions may have survived in both. The paper is most interest ing in its historic-ethnic discourse and in the iconog raphy but it is regrettable that there is no metrologic work in respect of the sounds produced by similar items in respect of the holes drilled through the shells and with regard to mouthpieces. In the addendum Both mentions only timbre variations dependant on the size of the shells with large specimina producing deep drone and that slow periodic amplitude vibrations may be heard when several shells of different sizes are played together. RD Jose Perez de Arce Antoncich, Ethnographic Anal ogies between South Andean Patterns of Dance-Music Traditions and their Pre-hispanic Evidence. The au thor advocates that the study of pre-Hispanic music implies a four step process, as he calls it, consisting firstly of the archaeological data, secondly of the ethnographic techniques for the purpose of compara tive research in musical analogies. The third step consists in the understanding of historical changes linking first and second steps and the fourth is the interpretation of the archaeological record in relation to the ethnographic model. These steps are defined prior to the apprehension of the ethnographic model which localises instruments in time and space before addressing to the matter of 'timbre-harmony' in their 'complex timbre' and 'harmonic amplitude concepts'. This study follows with 'Multi-Orchestral Polyphony' in relation to what Jose Perez de Arce Antoncich calls the 'Poco Varia concept', the 'Competition' and 'Ran dom Design'. Space in Southern Andean orchestral music is then considered in terms of 'Orchestral Walk Through' and 'Place Walk-Through'. Duality is con sidered with regard to 'Pairs of Flutes', 'Pairs of Rows' and 'Emparejado'. Trance is addressed prior to a summary of steps three and four. The conclusion is that the author's methodological tools allow for an articulation of a perspective of sound properties more appropriate to explain the use, manipulation, articula tion, variation and contextualisation of other cultures from the remote past.

This is a lucid description of a musical instrument's development from its earliest sources. The earliest example of the qin, from the 5lh century BCE, has come to light fairly recently. Despite the gaps in sources over the 1000-year period under consideration, Lawergren demonstrates aspects of con tinuity between actual and iconographic sources, so as to distinguish the instrument from other zithers like the se. For example, the qin is distinguished by its idiosyncratic tuning mechanism, which is located un der the instrument. Lawergren's discussion of the qin's development highlights an important change in play ing technique. The modern sliding technique is shown to have developed around 150 BCE, as earlier sources show the distance of the string from the soundboard to have been too great to allow the string to touch the soundboard. It could be argued that changes such as these represent a break, and therefore we are dealing with a different instrument. However, Lawergren dem onstrates this change to have been gradual, along with the instrument's gradual expansion in length. Lastly, Lawergren's point regarding knowledge of the qin informing our reading of ancient Chinese literature, in which various references are made to the qin, is in triguing. A much fuller treatment of these textual sources would be desirable. SM Margaret Bastin, The Yal of the Ancient Tamils. The author has provided us with a good abstract. Now is the time for her to produce both textual and icono graphic evidence in full along with rigorous and me ticulous explanations for the phases of her reconstruc tion of the instrument along with her reasons for each decision in this respect without which merit to her cannot be properly evaluated. RD Monika Zin, Die altindischen vinäs. This is an account of the term lvinä\ from second millennium BC sources up to 12th century CE. A wide range of primary textual sources, reflecting the various lan guages and cultures of ancient India, are utilised, along with discussions of secondary literature and extensive iconography. Zin traces the development of the term 'vinä' as a designation of instruments such as an arched harp, stick-zither and lute. It appears that the 'vinä' as a term for a lute is late, and that the term lvallakV was used instead for this instrument during the early period. Often in music archaeology, the issue of precise musical terminology and its complex rela tionship to iconography or instrumental finds, is avoided in favour of wider issues. Zin's study is exemplary for its detailed, critical analysis of a single musical term from all angles. SM IV.2 - Studies on Examples from Ancient Egypt, Ancient Israel, Greek Antiquity and Ancient Central and North Europe Ricardo Eichmann, The Design of Ancient Egyptian Spike Lutes. All that Eichmann says regarding his approach to the reconstruction of historical instru ments, or 'Historischer Nachbau\ is well put. It is certain that late 19th and early 20"1 century reconstruc tions of instruments, and here harpsichords and the good name of Arnold Dolmetsch spring to mind, have had their disputable moments. However, we would not be where we stand today had it not been for their mistakes and should be humbly grateful for they have taken the blame in our stead. And what of Leonard Woolley's aberration with his teratologic reconstruc tion of Pu Abi's Ur 'harp-lyre' which was still praised at the British Museum some years ago. But it was the same Woolley who was hagiologically inspired with his preservation of the Ur silver lyre without which it would have had vanished for ever. The history of preservation and subsequently of reconstruction of the instruments of the past teaches us one essential matter which is that we must at all times be humble for the mistakes all of us have and will make, without any doubt, as we shall have to face them in due time. Eichmann also says that we should avoid rebuilding instruments in an anachronistic way. This again is certain. However, sometimes and in the absence of sufficient evidence, subjectivist reconstruction will always reveal more than objective abstention. In the field of archaeo-organology there is only one rule which can be set in stone and it says that all that is not reversible must never be attempted on any extant material. All else has its merits because it allows for countless empirical experimentation from which much can be learnt if carefully assessed. Regarding propor tionality, the standard is man himself as indeed it is the comfortable playing of an instrument which is the key to good music, evidently. Thus the natural posi tion of fingers on a lute neck or on the body of a flute is the goal. Only then the laws of proportionality for scaling can apply and this is the reason why no two similar instruments of antiquity have identical patterns of proportion but would probably had they belonged to the same musician. The absence of textual or icono graphic evidence of workshops where instruments would have been made might indicate that instruments were made by their players. This would also account for the absence of any apparent standard in their making and that therefore the approportionating of the strings would be in function of the musician/maker's own anthropometry. RD Stefan Hagel, Calculating Auloi - The Louvre Au los Scale. Hagel's attempt at extrapolating some scal ing out of the Louvre aulös is somehow herculean in ambition. There are far too many approximations,</page><page sequence="9">Rezensionen 375 estimations, scribal errors, misinterpretations, proba bilities and even the possibility that the instrument object of Hagel 's disquisition might not, after all, be an aulös but two separate mönauloi. However, Hagel digs into this mass of inconsistencies and with admi rable discrimination manages firstly to reconcile Lan del's with his organological rules in that he vowed firstly in finding two finger holes likely to give a certain concordant interval of a fourth, preferably, on the ground that it constitutes the basic interval in Greek scales, secondly in calculating the effective length of the pipe from the distance between these finger holes and the ratio implied by that interval, e.g. the ratio of 4 : 3 for a fourth, and thirdly to calculate the pitches for the rest of the finger holes from their positions, using the effective length obtained in step 2. Then there was the matter of conciliating mathematics with the iconography, and then mathematics and ico nography with literary evidence, mainly with Plato's Laws for the enlightenment of his understanding of heterophonia. There has been a style of heterophonic lyre-music which Plato deprecated. As a conservative philosopher, he is orientated on the classical age be fore the composers of the New Music deteriorated everything. This 'real' Greek music did not depart from unison. Hagel introduces the Pseudo-Aristotelian Problem 19.9 and the Aristoxenian rhythmical theoiy, and a passage from Pseudo-Plutarch. From all of this Hagel derives that in the design of an aulös-pair it must have been of primary importance to have con cordant finger holes distributed between both pipes. Concords within one pipe would arise merely as a side effect of unisons and distributed concords. Thus it is confirmed that the traditional major assumption for the evaluation of single pipe scales must be met with suspicion. It might well prove even impossible except maybe sometimes on the ground of comparisons with extant pairs. Finally, Hagel agrees with Belis and West that the Louvre instruments are indeed to be paired as a single aulös. Hagel developed software in order to undertake his own metrology in respect of a series of parameters which he describes competently and from which he produces a series of graphics and figures which are very convincing despite of an initial infin itesimal likelihood of success. RD Maurice Byrne, Narrow Pipes and the Fourth. The generation of sub-harmonics is interesting experimen tation as brass players and composers know. However, these sounds do not come naturally to the player who will always favour the safest option when playing anything. Sub-harmonics might have been used in circumstances where their usage came from a specific request and in specific conditions. Furthermore one should take into account that the probability of anyone with the exception of the musician himself being able to say if a note were a sub-harmonic or not, is very unlikely. All of this is highly speculative and adding that we only have organological probability that cer tain wind instruments of antiquity might have pro duced sub-harmonics because of their structure but that there is no textual or iconographic evidence for the practice of such makes the whole assumption rather unsafe, as Byrne wisely says. RD Robert Gutmann, Die rumänische Panflöte nai. Geschichtliche, typologische und psychologische Bedin gungen. Gutmann's paper is about the Rumanian nai known to us as panpipes, and its origins. Gutmann leads us from Asia Minor origins of the Syrinx and covers some of the Greek mythology as well as Indian and other occurrences. All of this is very well docu mented with abundant references, robust bibliography and interesting illustrations. However, it is regrettable that the organological aspect is missing as indeed with the exception of some metrology in respect of the Rumanian paradigm nothing is said of comparative studies in this respect. RD Moshe Fischer, A Terracotta Harp Player from Hellenistic Yavneh-Yam {Israel). This is a very studi ous paper where an artefact is analysed in respect firstly of the location of its discovery; secondly in its general description; thirdly in the description of the instrument which is the object of the artefact and fourthly in its archaeological context. The description of the location is well put but could have been expand ed in relation to neighbouring ports to the North and to the South in respect of their contemporaneous eth no-historical trading routes. The general description of the object says that the terracotta statuette was made of two moulded halves which were then stuck togeth er, dipped in slip and dried prior to firing. This is of course consequential for dating in relation to the his torical development of kiln technology. Most impor tantly, because it was moulded, the object would have been replicated many times as the making of such a mould demanded time and skill. It is difficult to evaluate the number of pieces made. However, the atypicalism with regard to the position of the harpist's head is not as atypical as Fisher has put it but that it seems atypical because it is the first instance of exhu mation of a copy of the object of which other dupli cates will tum up, doubtless, in future digs. It is quite certain that in relation to Hellenistic studies the instru ment is a trigonon but that in relation to organology it is a medium sized angular open frame harp. It is regrettable that the line drawing of the statuette is of an inexpert hand and should be drawn again with all the accuracy the object deserves. Fisher then gives a satisfactory description of the archaeological context before concluding. RD Axel May, Ein hallstattzeitlicher Aulosbläser aus Venne bei Osnabrück.

RD V - Written Evidence: Musical Notations of "Beginnings" Stelios Psaroudakes, The Orestes Papyrus: Some Thoughts on the Dubious Musical Signs. The Orestes papyrus was extracted from the cartonnage of a mum my from Hermoupolis Magna in Egypt and dated from about 200 BC. This paper is about the interpretation of 2 musical signs, one a step-like sign and the other a hook-gamma-sigma. In 1892, Wessely published the papyrus for the first time to be followed by Crusius one year later, then by Monro, Williams, Clements, Reinach, Mountford, Reese, Martin, Wagner, Düring, Del Grande, Dale, Winnington-Ingram, Pöhlmann, Richter, Handerson and Wulstan, Marzi, Solomon, Neubecker, Chaillet, Akkeren, Mathiesen, Comotti and lastly West. This paper is an excellent synthesis of researches undertaken on this matter for over one century but the author's opinion remains inconclusive. However Psaroudakes' finds it attractive that '... the three notes are placed in an ascending order of pitch ... creating a melody resembling the movement of waves: the destructive, greedy waves of the sea, which rip aloft the sail of the swift craft, relentlessly toss it about, swamp it, and finally swallow it up, just as Klytemnestra's motherly blood tortures Orestes and destroys his prosperity.' RD Ralf Martin Jäger, Von der griechischen Antike zur Epoche des Christentums. Überlegungen zu einem notationstechnischen Paradigmenwechsel an der Schwelle zum Mittelalter. The author attempts to an swer very difficult questions surrounding the begin nings of western and Byzantine chant notation. Jäger's enquiry claims a prominent place for the survival of ancient Greek musical notation into the early Middle Ages. The most important sources used are Boethius' 6th century De Institutione Musica and the anonymous 9th century treatise Musica Enchiriadis. The latter's employment of 'Dasian' notation, which seems to be derived from Greek notation, remains controversial. Jäger asserts that both early western chant and Byzan tine chant employed relatively simple text-centred notations in the 9lh century, as a deliberate rejection of sophisticated Greek methods, with their strong pagan associations. It seems clear that text-based chant was favoured in early Christianity, at least partly in reac tion to the perceived depravity associated with secular instrumental music. Such music, which was originally transmitted orally, would indeed have had little need for Greek notation. Jäger's argument is not implausible. However, more sources from the period between the 6lh and 9"1 centu ries are needed to complete the picture regarding motivations surrounding the development of such a musical aesthetic, and the consequent adoption of 9Ul century chant notations. Furthermore, the development of western chant notation should be seen in the wider context of Jewish and Christian ekphonetic notations, dating from around the 6th/7th centuries CE. SM Max Haas, Notizen zur Möglichkeit, Musik in münd lichen Traditionen aus historischer Perspektive zu untersuchen. Haas firstly summarises the author's book Mündliche Überlieferung und Altrömischer Choral (Berne, 1997). Secondly, aspects of the author's recent research are presented. Essentially, Haas' article is concerned with the development of a methodology which can be utilised in the analysis of oral transmis sion, in the case of early Roman chant. Haas con sciously borrows 'distributional' methods from lin guistics, in order to explore the distribution of 'Silben strecken' (the melodic content of syllables) in the corpus of chant under consideration. A computer pro gramme is used for this purpose, the capabilities of which are demonstrated by the author. The most im pressive conclusions which Haas has reached include the notion that particular 'Silbenstrecken' appear in specific contexts. For example, one such melodic unit is shown to appear only as the closing syllable of a transitive word. Indeed, despite appearances that Haas' methodology is merely statistical and 'unmusical', the collection of data is usually context-specific. Haas claims to combine methods from diverse dis ciplines, which is clear in the case of linguistics,</page><page sequence="11">Rezensionen 377 although much less developed in the case of psychol ogy. Due to the difficult questions being asked, Haas' enquiry is unlikely to be conclusive. However, such considered and systematic investigations into theories of oral transmission hold much promise for our under standing of the beginnings of Western chant.

This is a consideration of a 12lh century text which is relevant to the construction of the cymbala and organ. Brepohl's article is a well-argued presentation and analysis of the text, written from the perspective of a contemporary instrument maker. Unfortunately, Brepohl does not refer to the argument which exists surrounding the cymbala in this period. The term 'cymbalum' was used for a monastic bell from the 1 llh century. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether the term refers to a practical instrument, or whether it is a symbolic term in the 12th century.2 Surely a consideration of this issue should precede any attempt to reconstruct the instrument from Theophilus' text, which would in any case be interest ing.

RD Ricardo Eichmann, Neuaufnahme einer Schalen Spießlaute von Deir el-Medina [Grab 1389] / Ägypten. This is a revealing examination of a lute which has been known for some years. Eichmann's careful exam ination of marks on the instrument demonstrate two important features which have hitherto been unknown. Firstly, marks on the neck are shown to be fret impres sions, which are analysed to demonstrate features of the instrument's original tuning. Such attempts to determine tuning by analysing instrumental remains are often extremely complex, especially with wind instruments. However, a fretted string instrument can be more reliable in this sense, as interval relationships are not as dependable on playing styles. The 'neutral third', which is a well-known feature of contemporary Arabic music (although much Arabic music has unfor tunately adopted Western tuning in the twentieth cen tury), is shown to have been a feature of this lute, as well as the Coptic lute. Eichmann also demonstrates that marks on the instrument probably result from the use of a plectrum. This was already thought to be the case, as a wooden plectrum was found near the instrument, and icono graphic sources also suggest the use of a plectrum.
