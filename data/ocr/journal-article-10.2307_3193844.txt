<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECIAL T H E M E ReCognizing Works urrently, there is a great deal of discussion in art education about teaching that facilitates the discovery and exploration of meaning in works of art. Discovering and exploring meaning in new and unfamiliar works of art, especially con- temporary ones, can be perplexing. This is especially true if our goal is to assist students in connecting works of art to their lives through knowledge of the past and present. This kind of knowing is not unidimensional, narrow in scope or importance. Rather, it requires diverse kinds of knowledge, past and present, that informs, illumi- nates, and broadens our thinking. Unfortunately, many students, on their own, do not take the time to search out the multiple dimensions of an artistic phenomenon. Either they accept, with- out question, the information or inter- pretations given to them by educators or critics or they only accept content that fits comfortably into their already existing knowledge base. When they do so, they function unidimensionally, from one perspective. For example, a student who, in discussing the official language for the state of California, decides that we need not concern our- selves with the Spanish language because California is an American state, has forgotten that historically California was originally and still is inhabited by Spanish speaking peoples. The students myopic view prohibits her from seeing the broad picture that involves more than what she sees today. She does not recognize aspects of what occurred in the past. This short- sightedness is even more apparent when studying works of art. As human beings, we often tend to place ourselves at the center of a situa- tion while the rest of the world recedes in its significance. This egocentric posi- tion often prevents us from broadening our perspective and accepting new and unfamiliar ideas. Since the novel and unaccustomed may inspire us toward wild imaginings and discomfort, we tend to embrace what we already know. When studying works of art, we are inclined to bring to our analyses this same limited view based primarily on our personal experiences, which are lodged in our comfort zone. While the personal knowledge we carry to a situa- tion may be helpful, it is sometimes inadequate, inaccurate, and misin- formed. This type of knowledge does not enable us to grasp the broader pic- ture of the object as it connects with its historical and cultural life (Chanda, 1992). Works of art are like written languages. They have symbols that communicate thoughts and feelings. Just as a foreigner may comprehend the words in an American idiom, such as "kick the bucket," but not under- stand that it means "to die," it is possi- ble to comprehend the visual language in a work of art but not understand the meaning. If we compare our experi- ences with works of art to the foreigner learning American idioms, we begin to recognize how we too might compre- hend an artistic phenomenon yet not be aware of its meaning. In short, we pos- sess physical knowledge of it, but do not grasp the contextual knowledge that surrounds this work of art. If we function only at the level of physical knowing, we may not allow ourselves the opportunity to more fully under- stand the work. Physical knowing is a form of unidimensional thinking that is often based on the relationship between the visual language we encounter and our own personal expe- rience. However, contextual knowing, which entails understanding meaning, requires that we expand our experi- ence by going beyond the words in the language to recognize the source of their origin to see their general, individ- ual, collective, conventional, and possi- ble hidden implications. In order to study and understand the general import or meaning of contem- porary and past art, we must consider the epistemological or knowledge base; that is, the origin, nature, and limits of knowledge as related to the work of art. Using the epistemological base as a paradigm brings another dimension to our thinking process and provides an alternative approach to teaching that can assist learners in grasping the process involved in a broader way of knowing. AN APPROACH TO TEACHING We teach to provide students with tools for learning that are transferable across and through life experiences. If our tools are limited, then our percep- tions and our knowledge will be limit- ed. Students should be equipped with tools that will enable them to think broadly and creatively. Thinking ART EDUCATION / MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="2">of Art: broadly, therefore implies looking at the origin, nature, and limits of knowl- edge. The tools to accomplish this are found in looking at the past environ- ment, present circumstances and future implications. Like other disci- plines, the study of art can be a vehicle for acquiring such learning tools. The world of art is replete with examples that draw from the historical and cultur- al context in order to provide informa- tion about the present and implications for the future. As an educational tool, art at its fun- damental level is multidimensional. It is multidimensional because it is time- less. Works of art seldom lose their meanings, but are like dynamic, organ- ic organisms that continually develop meanings over time and space, for their various contexts provide multiple truths (Chanda, 1998). Glazer (1994) indicates "history... should be contin- uously re-imagined, and thereby revi- talized, for each historical situation" (p. 411). We are concerned here with re-imagining historical and cultural meanings, meanings that are dynamic and consequently change over time and through space. These meanings draw from historical and cultural refer- ents in order to speak to a contempo- rary situation or environment. Once we see the multidimensionality of works of art, we are ready to move away from our personal, egocentric viewpoint and embrace a broader construct that relates to a collective history. The notion of collective history refers to various themes that people experience across cultures. Works of art can, thus, serve as a vehicle for moving away from the egocentric position to embrace a sense of collectivity. The Essences Understanding BY JACQUELINE CHANDA AND VESTA DANIEL MARCH 2000 / ART EDUCATION</page><page sequence="3">ReCOGNIZING CONTEMPORARY WORKS OF ART We are suggesting a way of teaching that explores the nexus between histori- cal and cultural content in works of art using examples of African-descended art as a paradigm for reCognizing. This word looks very similar to recognizing, however, recognizing refers to the act of perceiving, seeing something again or recalling an image. ReCognizing refers to the act of cognitively restructuring one's thinking, getting to know a previ- ously known thing in new ways or an unknown thing, like a work of art, in multiple ways. In order to reCognize we must: (a) go beyond the physical know- ing or comprehending to gain a contex- tual knowing that is constructed by time and place; (b) grasp the inherent char- acter of the work of art situated in time and space, present and past; and (c) rec- ognize its inner force which relates to its timeless ability to address us as a collec- tion of people. ReCognizing, therefore, demands that we take a broad view of the histori- cal and cultural genesis of images and icons, which link the present to the past. ReCognizing, consequently, entails con- sidering the present meanings in light of the past, past motivations in light of the present, and co-existing realities or truths across time. THE KWANZAA PLAYGROUND: A ReCOGNIZING PARADIGM An example of some of the compo- nents of reCognition can be played out against the backdrop of the Kwanzaa Playground in Columbus, Ohio. Created in 1993 by activist and art edu- cator Shirley Bowen, her young son Calid, and seven Columbus-based, African-descended artists, the award- winning Kwanzaa Playground is believed to be the first African inspired, Figure 1.

Photo courtesy of Shirley Bowen. didactic playground in Ohio and possibly the United States. It provides what we feel is an excellent example of how history and culture combine to clarify aspects of contemporary art. The permanently installed works of art are the African Tell-A-Story Board, by Larry Winston Collins, Thrones to the Earth and Sky, by Barbara Chavous, Tekken (obelisk), by Pheoris West and Nommo X, Ceramic Pedestals, by William Agnew, Baobab Tree and Adinkra Fence, by Andrew Scott, African Portal, by Queen Brooks, and the forthcoming seven Kwanzaa Plaques by Lavere Brown. The Playground is located on a cor- ner, in a historically African-descended community whose population is shift- ing. The playground is nested in an urban space characterized by a long history of visual and performing artists, writers, parks, recreation and arts centers, storytellers, alcohol and drug abusers, social service agencies, displaced small businesses, new small businesses, churches, spiritualists, professionals, and community leaders. An aerial view of the Kwanzaa Playground shows that its internal shape is anthropomorphic; it presents itself in the human form. The anthropo- morphic shape places the works of art, the people present, and activities con- ducted in the Playground into a human, relational space. ReCognizing would motivate us to ask such questions as how does the importance of the figure interface with the arrangement of the Playground space? Does the arrange- ment of the space encourage a perspec- tive and a type of interaction that is of a particular sort? The collection of art objects in the Playground supports the theme of "lessons for living" based on the "Nguzo Saba" or seven principles of Kwanzaa which are unity, self-determi- nation, collective work and responsibili- ty, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. Each of these principles has a Kiswahili language ART EDUCATION / MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="4">equivalent (umoja, kujichagulia, ujima, ujamma, nia, kuumba, imani). Although each artist created her/his piece independently, initially artists came together over the idea of the social and cultural significance of exploring these lessons for living through their art. Central to their collective motivation is the idea of African-inspired art created by African- descended artists in a familiar community space. Awareness of this relationship underscores the connec- tion between African and African- descended histories in a contemporary setting (Daniel, 1997). There are, at this point, in the Playground no signifiers that translate the space and its contents in literal, metaphorical, or symbolic ways. So how do we come to reCognize what the Kwanzaa Playground, and the artworks therein, are about? How does one build the foundation needed to know the art objects and the space in new and multiple ways? And, is the acquisition of an epistemological base limited to people who are more likely to be "contextual familiars," i.e., African-descended peoples living in the community that houses the Kwanzaa Playground, or is cross-contextual relevance possible? These questions, easily and satisfactori- ly answerable or not, are addressed by exploring the individual work of art such as the African Portal. THE AFRICAN PORTAL The African Portal by Queen Brooks marks the front entrance to the Playground. It is 8 feet tall and 11 feet wide, made of two joined layers of cedar and embellished with wood- burned and painted images on all visible sides. The images are of real and imaginary objects and animals inspired by Queen's study of African objects, sym- bols, and design elements. The African Portal, as a recognizable entrance, invites the exploration of creative paths to self-knowledge (a lesson for living) as you enter or leave the Playground. However, in order to understand this artwork and not just comprehend it physically, exploration of another dimension, the individual symbols created by the artist, will be necessary. There is a bird on one of the edges of the African Portal that provides insight into the significance of cultural and his- torical facts, which lead to the creation of contemporary meanings. On the African Portal the name of the red bird might not be known by either the artist or by the visitors to the Playground. The bird is part of an entrance that is contextually unusual and unique. It is placed amongst other colorful elements on the portal. The artist tells us that she hopes that children and others will be attracted to these colorful elements. Like multi- colored balloons tied to the doorway of a house, these bright designs signal that something special (like a birthday party) is going on inside. If generally recognizable items, such as a large red bird make the children curious, then Just as the Nike symbol found on tennis shoes points back to the essence of the character of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, so the red bird or Senufo bird points back to essential elements of community life within the poro society.

African Portal, close-up of the red bird. those who know more about the elements as symbols are afforded the opportunity to teach and to urge children to consider the meaning of the bird and other elements. The motif of the bird used on the Portal recalls the shape of a sculpture found among the Senufo people of the Cote d' Ivoire, a bird, which represents the hornbill. Through the study of the shape of the red bird we recognize its similarity to the hombill, a well-known tropical bird that resides in both Africa and Asia. The bird on the portal and the Senufo bird have one major feature in common, a large protruding stomach. Since we know that the visual elements on the portal refer to African imagery, we can infer that this hornbill represents an African hornbill and more specifically a ground hornbill. The stylistic quality helps us to recog- nize it as a two-dimensional variation of a three-dimensional Senufo bird. THE SENUFO BIRD The Senufo bird, called Porgaga or the great mythical bird, is a wooden statue that ranges from about 36 inches to 6 feet in height. According to myth the horbill bird was one of the first five animals to inhabit the earth and the first to be killed for food. In this respect, it helped sustain the physical life of man and woman, and thus became the symbol for life force or energy that pervades all creation. This bird has become an icon for the people of the Cote d' Ivoire and for the Senufo people in general. The significance of the hornbill icon is multidimensional. It refers to fertility and intellectual development through the lo orporo society-a male social institution that deals with initiation of young boys. As a symbol of fertility, it makes reference to the dual male and female forces of procreation. The long beak represents the male and the swollen belly is said to portray the pregnant female. As an allegoric form it stands for the continuity of the whole community. This object not only reflects the physical plane but also the intellectual plane, for the inscriptions (tortoise, monitor lizard, and python) found on the outspread wings relate to a body of knowledge that poro initiates must master as they progress ultimately through three initiation stages. Each stage leads to more knowledge about life. The statue is connected with ances- tors, family, and village unity. In this context, the bird is known as "mother of the poro child" (Holas, 1985). Holas indicates that the great statue of the bird may be seen in the sacred grove, a place where important ritual events take place in Senufo villages. As we contemplate the information provided about the original context of this bird we ask ourselves how does this relate to the present context? How has the icon been transformed and how do we reCognize it? ART EDUCATION / MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="6">The creation of the Kwanzaa Playground was a community act. The Senufo bird is con- nected with community acts. The bird in the tra- ditional Senufo culture provides lessons about the ancestors, social cus- toms, and future genera- tions in very much the same way that the Kwanzaa Playground provides lessons about community awareness. . The red bird is connect- ;' ed with the formal entrance into the play- ground, the Senufo bird guards the entrance to the sacred grove. Based on the information pro- Figure 4. Senuft vided, we no longer see de Civilisations the bird as just an African motif used by an artist to decorate a portal, but a motif empowered with meaning that is rele- vant to the historical as well as present day context. Just as the Nike symbol found on tennis shoes points back to the essence of the character of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, so the red bird or Senufo bird points back to essential elements of community life within the poro society. CONCLUSION In order to reCognize the image in its present context, we must transform our thinking by first moving beyond the physical knowing and into the con- textual knowing by making ourselves aware of the origin, nature, and limits of its historical and cultural setting. In short, as we contemplate the relation- ship between the red bird of the Kwanzaa playground and the Senufo bird, we must consider the epistemo- logical base of both: (a) Origin. They both have their origin within an African context. Queen Brooks was aware of the motif of the Senufo bird and used it as an African symbol. (b) Nature. Both birds are related to entrances, the entrance to the Kwanzaaplayground and the entrance to the sacred grove among the Senufo and they are both related to community activities. _ i-. (c) Limits ofknowledge. M The historical and cultural setting of the red bird are delineated by the African- American community that resides in the area of the Musee National Kwanzaa playground, n, Cote d' Ivoire. while that of the Senufo bird is delineated by the Senufo people and more specifically the poro society. The image and placement of the Senufo bird have been revised from the past in order to give meaning to the pre- sent. Queen Brooks has taken an object from another time and space and invested it with new significance for the community in which it functions. In reCognizing the original historical object we discover that its epistemolog- ical base is remarkably similar to that of our time. It is within these parameters that we reCognize its meaning and find in it our collective, lived or emotional experience. It is also within this con- text that we recognize that if our under- standing of a work of art is limited and its meaning unidimensional, then our ability to grasp its present context will also be limited. If our understanding is broad, meaning multidimensional, then we will see and study the work of art from its multiple perspectives. As we have seen, the red bird on the Portal has the potential to function as a symbol-a thing that holds meaning- for those who see it on the portal. The meaning is new, one that is contempo- rary. However, by seeing this symbol in multidimensional ways, the influence of a historic bird on the present-day red bird can contribute to a greater in-depth understanding of both the past and the present.
