LL Pgil " rr Editorial Note: In view of the specific nature of the case studies presented in this paper, the Editor offered Bruce Carpenter and Frank Wiggers, editors of the catalogue Mentawai Art (Singapore: Archipelago Press, 1999) accompanying the Chicago exhibition of the same name, the right to reply for simultaneous publication with this article. Their comment follows the article. Professor Jerome Feldman, who wrote the introduction to the catalogue, has been offered space to respond independently in a future issue. Other reactions are of course welcome as well. In the production of ethnic art, more and more ingenious methods are being introduced to make objects look antique and 'authentic'. A key factor in this development is the seemingly inexhaustible purchasing power of the market. Even experienced art connoisseurs are increasingly being taken in when evaluating objects manipulated to create the impression of authenticity. In this paper, I shall examine a phenomenon that takes this process one step further, pre- senting a case where in my opinion imitations are success- fully marketed as products of the inherited stylistic canon of an ethnic group, and where these subsequently distort that very stylistic canon. Authenticy and stylistic canon The term 'authentic' is one with positive connotations, suggesting that the item in question is 'genuine' and derived from a source held in high esteem. In the evalua- tion of ethnic art, it is applied to objects produced for local and, in most cases, ethnic-specific use, and contrasted with 'fakes' or 'forgeries' that intentionally pretend to have such provenance. However, even tourist or airport art can be considered 'authentic' provided that such artefacts have not secretly been modified at a later date (for instance, by artificial aging) with the intention of making them appear to be something they are not (Corbey 2000:84, Moss 1994:101). 'Authenticity' is therefore not based on some quality inherent in the object, as every object is authentic in its own right. Only when a producer, dealer or owner places the object in a feigned context can it be categorized as inauthentic, i.e. a fake. As the catalogue to the 1990 British Museum exhibition on fakes puts it (Jones 1990), such characterizations can alter over the history of an object: 'What is fraudulent in one context is quintessentially genuine in another'. This ties in with Appadurai's (1986) thesis of the contextuality of value in the 'social life' of an object. Nevertheless, the retrospective discovery that something is 'inauthentic' does appear to reduce its artistic value in the eyes of dealers and collectors. Jones (1990) furnishes some inter- esting examples of this phenomenon. Artefacts unmasked as forgeries are as a rule repudiated, however highly they had been valued - and also evaluated in financial terms - prior to their exposure as fakes. In general, there is little inclination to reappraise such objects in their own terms - a fact which may be exacerbated by the disappointment of having been deceived (Price 1991:21). 'Stylistic canon' refers to the particulars of an artistic heritage that producers of art within a particular tradition have handed down from generation to generation in ever new variations. As early as the 1960s, detailed investiga- tions of individual artists showed how important personal input can be in creating artefacts that expand the scope of an anonymous tradition.' It is precisely through such - no less authentic - innovative creations that a stylistic her- itage is enriched and its dynamics renewed. Every canon is subjected to individual artistic preferences and thus con- tinually in a state of flux. In addition, however, in ethnic art production the sty- listic canon is changing because of new creations for the market that reflect adaptations to presumed contemporary Western taste. Producers aim to turn a profit on pseudo-tra- ditional artefacts by anticipating what appeals to the buyers. Such apparently inauthentic developments some- times eventually exert an influence on local production. The external stimuli that had, in first instance, given rise to fabrication of forgeries can become detached from deceitful intentions and develop into a factor that turns into an inspiration for the further evolution of a style. This paper focuses on the manipulations of the Mentawai sty- listic canon in recent art production. Changes in a living artistic tradition Siberut, the largest island in the Mentawai archipelago, is situated to the west of Sumatra; I have conducted several periods of extensive fieldwork there over the last three decades. With a surface area similar to that of Bali but only about 25,000 inhabitants, it is sparsely populated. Siberut is one of few places in Indonesia where a flourishing tribal artistic tradition has survived into the present. Museums and collections have preserved some old documents from this tradition that date to the decades around 1900; these share features of a heritage that can be traced back to the South-East Asian Neolithic period and the early metal age (Dongson period). Many of these artefacts are related to headhunting, including spectacular, elaborately decorated shields, elegantly carved daggers and monumental human figures (see Fig. 1) which sometimes show certain similar- ities with better known representations from neighbouring ethnic groups (Nias, Sumatra, Sulawesi). The Dutch colonial government's ban on headhunting around the time of the First World War severely curtailed the motives for artistic creation on Siberut. Headhunting was not frequently practised on the island, but in religious terms it was conceived as a vital source of supernatural blessings. At the same time, because of its dangers, it was an outstanding opportunity for individuals and groups to win renown and prestige. The tensions involved created a strong incentive for all kinds of artistic manifestations.2 There is no tradition on Siberut of keeping artefacts that have lost their function. After the prohibition on head- hunting, most objects related to the practice soon rotted away in the tropical climate. Among the few artefacts that have survived are a number of shields, on which people had carved the contours of the hands of deceased relatives as memorials. The pride with which these shields were shown to me and the admiring comments of the people about these and some other relics of the pre-colonial period demonstrated how much they value their own 'heroic' past. Other reasons for the production of artistic objects remained, however. The artefacts which continued to be produced included attributes of the religious feasts of the communities, such as wooden birds created as 'soul toys' (cf. Schefold 1979/80) or the so-calledjaraik (see Fig. 2), an elaborate openwork carving with a monkey skull which This is an abridged version of a contribution to the European Association for Southeast Asian Studies (EUROSEAS) conference held at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, 6-8 September 2001.

Other objects which continued to be made were certain everyday utensils highly valued by the owner, such as bows, paddles and architectural decorations. It is striking, however, that the vigour of the products of headhunting times, with their competitive undertones, is rarely matched in later objects. This fact was recognized rather nostalgically by several of my informants of the older generation. The politics of the post-colonial national government dealt a further blow to artistic production, enforcing mod- ernization and imposing the adoption of either the Islamic or the Christian faith. The old rituals and the occupation of longhouses were forbidden. Thus, with the exception of a few objects for daily use such as hunting bows, the inher- ited stimuli for artistic creation were effectively lost. Only some remote groups in the island's interior managed to hold out until the advent of the somewhat more tolerant period that prevails at present. Among these groups, many old rituals and their associated artistic traditions persist to this day. A fresh impetus was generated by adventure tourism, which, as yet in modest numbers, has recently begun to penetrate to groups adhering to more conservative lifestyles and in so doing has suddenly invested the old way of life with an economic advantage. In order to meet the wishes of the largely young tourists, various conven- tional articles are fabricated for them. These are plain and usually rather carelessly made souvenirs. Generally, in this context there is as yet neither a demand for nor a supply of old ritual objects. The collector's quest for 'traditional art' When I first went to Siberut in 1967 it was still possible to acquire ancient disused objects, many of which were at that time slowly rotting away. These were featured, together with some more recent pieces, in the catalogue of an exhibition held in 1979/80 in Delft and ZUrich (Schefold 1979/80). I donated, and also sold, a few arte- facts to museums in Amsterdam, Dallas and Delft where they are now on display, and two items found their way to private collectors. In 1991 the catalogue was also pub- lished in Indonesian, and inspired an art-loving Batak trader from central Sumatra, living in the harbour village of Muara Siberut, to undertake some artistic efforts of his own. Some of these products were sold and later offered on the Sumatran and occasionally even the European art market as 'Mentawai art'. At the same time, a demand for old authentic pieces began to emerge. Indonesian dealers in ethnographic artefacts operating from Bali, the present- day centre of ethnic art exports (and in many cases of the production of ethnic fakes as well), travelled through the villages of Siberut and tried to purchase whatever was within reach. But apart from a few lucky exceptions, these traders had simply come too late. Foreign demand for art provided the impetus for the production of new artefacts. This was first brought to my attention through a letter from a museum in Linz in Austria asking my opinion about the photograph of a blackened figure of a squatting monkey that allegedly came from Siberut. I answered that the figure was clearly reminiscent of Mentawai, but probably represented a modemrn creation as such free-standing monkey figures did not belong to the long-established art of the island. My own impression was that of an unusually elegant variation of a house decoration made for, or at least influenced by, the demands of tourists or dealers. In the museum catalogue it was later described as a house decoration from southern Siberut, presumably of rather recent origin, and printed full-page (Leigh- Theisen and Mittersakschmiller 1999:111). A basically similar but much more elaborate figure is o I 0 11 w m shown as a 'centrepiece' in the glossy and substantial cat- alogue of a Chicago art gallery for a sale devoted exclu- sively to the art of Mentawai (see Wiggers and Carpenter 1999). The authors specifically refer to the equivalent found in the catalogue of the Linz museum. The figure's place of origin is listed as Sakuddai [Sakuddei]. The Sakuddei form a group of some forty people in the barely accessible western part of Siberut where I conducted most of my fieldwork in Mentawai. I can say with certainty that up to the time of my visits such figures had never been made there. I have shown the illustration to an acquaintance, a development consultant presently working on Siberut. He told me that he knew of several people in other parts of the island who were currently fabricating similar figures; these were made to be sold at a low price to dealers who happened to be passing through. He said local residents had been informed by dealers that potential buyers liked the pieces more if they had been subjected beforehand to an aging process that included hanging pieces above kitchen smoke, exposing them outside in the open air, or burying them in the ground. The reason for such 'preferences' was not quite clear to the carvers, however, as the experience of one of my stu- dents, Laurens Bakker, revealed.3 Bakker met another carver in Siberut who had sold his products in their pristine state, but now recounted with barely veiled anger that during a trip to Sumatra he had seen some of these in an art shop, where obviously they had been treated very disre- spectfully, displaying a considerable amount of damage and looking old and worn. In the meantime, the central piece in the Chicago cata- logue was sold for a considerable sum and now resides in a well-known American museum. It may be an indigenous product. In terms of imitations of their time-honoured art- forms, however, the people of Siberut have as yet not developed much initiative or talent for production for the market. The Batak trader in the harbour town of Siberut has helped fill this gap. At first purely for his own pleasure, he started to make some carvings that were inspired by old Siberut pieces he had seen, and also, he told me, by the illustrations in my Dutch-Swiss catalogue. These included house decorations, figures in relief and the like. When tourists and, in their wake, professional dealers gradually began to show interest, he started to sell these objects. Laurens Bakker showed the Chicago gallery catalogue to this trader who immediately recognized a jaraik carving, executed in a schematic and somewhat clumsy way but again labelled as coming from the Sakuddai [=Sakuddei], as his own work (see Fig. 3). He said that he had made it to order for the owner of a longhouse further upstream, who had mounted it in his house for a while and then sold it to a dealer. The French traveller Olivier Lelidvre photographed the jaraik while it was hanging in the longhouse and published it in his book on Siberut (see 3. Laurens Bakker was on Siberut from August through December 1996 for research on tourism, and from December through January 1999-2000 for a first reconnaissance of fakes and recent artefacts. He returned for more in-depth research on this question from December through February 2000-1; during that period he also researched possible connections in West-Sumatra and Bali. 4.

Comparing this photograph with that in the Chicago catalogue, it appears that since Lelievre's visit the paint has carefully been removed: the piece now looks older. Pertinently, the most sacred part, the original monkey skull, has apparently been replaced by another skull. Thus we can trace a remarkable 'social biography' of an artefact: from commodity via sacred object to - in my view - fake... The Chicago catalogue includes excellent photographs, extensive descriptions of the artefacts, and various intro- ductory texts. There are some good old pieces among the objects, including a shield with carved contours of hands, and a number of conventional artefacts. In addition to these, however, there is a group of objects that arouse sus- picion: they give the impression of having been made to look older than they actually are and yet they cannot simply be classified as recent imitations since their typical Siberut characteristics tend to give the impression of being a kind of 'quotation' in a foreign formal setting. Some of these are so bizarre that even minimal familiarity with local art forms should raise doubts about their real origins. For example, on Siberut there are elegantly carved paddles (Fig. 6), the balanced execution of which is the pride of their owners. But perhaps these are not spectacular enough. The Chicago catalogue boasts examples of a kind of super-paddle (Fig. 5), pieces on which, in my opinion, the exuberant handles contradict every Siberutan stylistic feeling and which, moreover, are completely unfit for use. Fakes and aesthetics Currently I am investigating several clear indications that we are dealing here with production external to Siberut. It is difficult to explain otherwise the alien and showy char- acter of many so-called Mentawai artefacts that have recently been arriving in increasing quantities on the Indonesian and international markets. Let me present two examples. The first example comes again from the Chicago cata- logue. One of the catalogue's most beautiful pieces is a carved door with the relief of a monitor lizard enclosed in a C-shaped ornamental design. On Siberut I have also come across doors with this design, but without figurative additions. Again, something purely ornamental like this was obviously too plain for the taste of the local dealers. This is the only explanation for one peculiar fantasy in the catalogue labelled as a jaraik, which as such is certainly not Siberutan. It was probably originally a door of the kind described above, sawn off at the top and bottom and rotated 90 degrees; five small monkey skulls, to all appearances belonging to different species, are decora- tively inserted into the - now U-shaped - ornament. 'Now, this is really too much' was, according to Laurens Bakker, the comment of a group of Siberut islanders to whom he showed the catalogue and who, on viewing all these half-familiar objects, had at first reacted with some amusement. Their anger was probably awakened by the diversity of the skulls.4 In a truejaraik, for religious reasons only one of the four native Mentawaian monkey species is permitted.' This is something the embellisher of the door did not take into account. In short, it is unlikely that people from Siberut would have executed such a fabrication. To call such a chimera a Mentawaijaraik is inappropriate. There are more artefacts in the Chicago catalogue that suggest production outside of Mentawai. This stands in contrast to the thoughtful and - some misunderstandings and speculations notwithstanding - competent introduc- tion to the background of Mentawai art by Jerome Feldman, a well-known ethnologist of art and outstanding expert on Nias, the neighbouring island to the north. Even in his comments, however, not a single word of caution appears concerning the unusual form of many of the arte- facts depicted. Feldman concludes his introduction by saying: 'There is some indefinable grace to this art which is to be found nowhere else.' He is not alone in this: even as well-informed an art ethnologist as Deborah Waite (1999) unconditionally follows Feldman's judgments, referring specifically to the jaraik.

When I questioned him about the meaning of the peculiar ground plan, he answered that he hoped that sooner or later tourists would come even to this remote region, and that he had prepared his house for them with a special tourist sec- tion. To this end, he had decorated one of the interior rooms with reliefs fashionably embellished with paint acquired from a Sumatran trader. Among the ornamental forms used, here and there were jaraik patterns (see Fig. 7). As an old friend, he allowed me to take photographs. Tourists, he assured me, would in days to come have to pay considerable sums of money to be allowed to do the same. His ambitions were not realized, as western Siberut proved to be too inaccessible to tourists. When we next met some nine years later my friend had again moved and settled in a new house in one of the villages supported by the local government. He did not mention what had hap- pened to his old house. All the greater was my surprise when I received the first issue of the new periodical Arts and Cultures, published by the Barbier-Mueller Museum in Geneva. There I found, as an introductory photograph (see Fig. 8) serving to add lustre to an interview with Douglas Newton (Mattet 2000), the picture of a piece from the Museum's collection, alleged to be from Mentawai, that triggered a feeling of djjc vu. Comparison with my Mentawai slides soon revealed that it showed one of the carvings with which my friend in western Siberut had wanted to embellish the walls of his would-be tourist home. Obviously a dealer had vis- ited even this remote region. Once again, for the local dealers the simple ornament was perhaps not spectacular enough. They had polished the relief up to become a pseudo-jaraik embellished with a number of monkey skulls. I would not be surprised if sooner or later some of the remaining wall carvings were to turn up in the art trade.6 Problems of appraisal How could an experienced collector like Jean-Paul Barbier, the founder of the Barbier-Mueller Museum, have been deceived by such a hybrid product? Of course Barbier is perfectly aware of the forgery problem in Indonesia.

In our case, however, it is clearly not just a matter of inferior copies but of a kind of imagined motif. Of course this does not mean that such an artefact cannot possess artistic value in its own right. But this is not BRUCE CARPENTER AND FRANK WIGGERS REPLY: In his article, Professor Schefold raises a number of complex and important issues (eth- ical, scientific, aesthetic and historical), each deserving careful consideration before serious conclusions can be made. Unfortunately, and in spite of its well-polished sur- face, he fails to establish the criteria, facts or methods necessary to achieve this. In his sudden rush to 'save' Mentawai art he has only succeeded in creating greater confu- sion. From the point of view of art history, Schefold speaks of the aesthetic canon of Mentawai art but fails even to begin to define it. He often justifies his claims that cer- tain pieces are fakes not on the basis of aesthetic observations, but of his personal opinions. Thus he suggests that freestanding ape statues never existed because he remembers none. Statues of ape-like human figures, animals (most notably birds) and near three-dimensional wood reliefs of apes do, however, exist - but these are apparently irrelevant. Culturally Schefold ignores the many anthropomorphic attrib- utes assigned to simians in ritual, myth and legend. Professor Jerome Feldman, a leading authority on Indonesian tribal art, clearly establishes the replacement of human skulls, used in an earlier period, by simian skulls, documenting the close link between both. On a scientific level it should be noted that all of Schefold's conclusions con- cerning the authenticity of the objects in our catalogue were made without the ben- efit of physical examination - a most unscientific procedure. Instead we are presented with fanciful stories of an artistic Batak, a member of a different ethnic group, who not only happened to live on Siberut but also was coincidentally inspired by the 1991 Indonesian edition of Schefold's Spielzeug catalogue to make copies. Without independent verification we will never know if this Batak informant actu- ally fabricated the heart-shaped jaraik, as photographed in a traditional Mentawai house by Olivier Lelievre before 1992. If we accept Schefold's premise, though, copies of the book must have travelled to the remote island of Siberut and the still anonymous artist must have developed his copyist talents in an extraordinarily short period of time. What disturbs us most is the unlikelihood that a Mentawai would commission a member of a different ethnic group to fabricate a sacred piece of ethnic-specific art (declared 'fake' by Schefold) for ritual use in a longhouse. Personally we feel it is far more probable that the informant in question misled the young researcher Laurens Bakker in 2000. Certainly, we do not deny the recent development of Mentawai-style art, not only on Siberut and Sumatra but also in Java, Bali and Lombok. Our objects, however, were collected between 1991 and 1996, and predate this industry. Unfortunately our catalogue may have actually stimulated it. Schefold and Bakker have chosen to overlook this chronology. Turning to the ethical issues, we may ask how is it that Schefold accumulated the largest private collection of Mentawai art? Isn't this, and his recent sales of two sig- nificant pieces from his collection to a major American museum, a conflict of interest for one who presents himself as a detached party? We make no comment on his claim to have saved these 'disused' pieces from destruction. A careful examina- tion of the panel in Fig. 1 reveals that it suffered little since it was photographed in situ by Beukering circa 1925 (KITLV#32652). Finally, we share Schefold's great love and concern for the people and culture of Mentawai. All of us mourn the vanishing tribal cultures and would like to save them. Shortly after the conquest of south Bali, the Dutch developed a policy that declared the island a living museum. Independence fighters denounced this as cultural impe- rialism intended to trap the Balinese in a romantic dream. Today we must all avoid similar errors. We acknowledge the profound issues raised by Professor Schefold but deplore his methods and failure to address them satisfactorily. In our opinion he has only added to the problem. We hope the noted scholar Professor Jerome Feldman will pursue this discussion in a future issue of AT. Until then we kindly request that readers suspend judgment. * The lower half of the back cover illustrates Reimar Schefold's article on Mentawai art: A shaman calls back the lost soul of a sick person with songs and the sound of a little bell. He has made an enticing decoration of leaves and flowers at the edge of the forest and invites the soul to return from the spot in which it has taken refuge. If he is not able to bring the soul back to its owner, the person may die. The people of Siberut relate to their souls as we might to a sensitive and somewhat wayward child. People should live in a way that is attractive to their souls, with long periods of leisure, good regularfood and beautifully staged rituals. They should avoid activities that could threaten the harmony of their relationship with the elements of their environment and observe the appropriate taboos when using them. The photograph was taken after a man had been hit by a tree he had felled during a taboo period. The frightened soul took flight and people feared that in the end it might settle with the ancestors. Decorations and carvings are used in such cases as 'soul toys' (umat simagere) to tempt the soul to return. In recent times, wooden 'soul toys', together with artefacts made for other occasions, have been appearing in increasing quantities on the art market. Many of them are recent fakes intended to entice not souls but wealthy buyers. This paper deals with these relatively recent developments. the issue that is at stake. The object is ascribed artistic quality under the assumption that it highlights an ancient local tradition. The value attributed to it - also in financial terms - stands and falls by this assumption. In his introduction to the Chicago catalogue, Bruce Carpenter, one of the organizers of the sale exhibition, voices his conviction 'that the beauty of Mentawai art proves the universality of aesthetics' (cf Waite 1988). The above examples demonstrate that things are not that simple. The objects I have examined in detail here may, along with others in the catalogue, fascinate the beholder with an 'aesthetic grace that mirrors their spiritual power' (Wiggers and Carpenter 1999), but such appraisals would be based on criteria developed within different artistic tra- ditions from the one under consideration. Without famil- iarity with Mentawai stylistic canon such criteria are not proof against artful manipulations directed towards satis- fying current external market expectations and demands. These appraisals are, I believe, flawed because these pieces were not submitted to systematic comparison. Of course, taste, intuition and general aesthetic sensibility are prerequisites for any appraisal, but these alone prove to be insufficient to get a sense of 'authenticity' in our example. Indeed, why did fundamental differences in the character of the formal creations mentioned not produce serious doubt? The conclusion is obvious: the question of which of the highly praised 'traditional' Siberut artefacts represent orig- inal variations of a shared artistic heritage, and which are in fact recent objects for sale that derive their value from suc- cessful deceit, can only be answered on the basis of a thor- ough acquaintance with the tradition itself. What has to be acknowledged, in other words, is 'the existence and legiti- macy of the aesthetic frameworks within which... works of Primitive Art ... [are] produced' (Price 1991:93). Conclusion It is somewhat ironic that Barbier (2000:167), in the same issue in which his jaraik-chimera is presented, emphasizes the need for careful comparison: 'Yet the collector must continue to base his or her decision on both stylistic analyses and personal experience patiently acquired by handling a large number of similar pieces.' It is precisely this 'patience' that has been lacking with respect to Siberut objects. It is not surprising, therefore, that people have been misled by elements of style that are in fact no more than 'formal quotations' in otherwise alien settings. One lesson to draw from this case is the need for better communication. All parties concerned - anthropologists, art historians, dealers, collectors, and of course the Mentawaians themselves - should share experience and knowledge. The purpose of this paper was 'to set the record straight'. If developments such as those sketched in this paper are not countered, fakes will enter into the rele- vant stylistic heritage. To quote Jones (1990:16): 'When a group of fakes is accepted into the canon of genuine work all subsequent judgements about the artist or period in question are based on perceptions built in part upon the fakes themselves.' This leads to a distortion of the canon that concerns not only art historians and collectors but also future generations of Mentawaians in search of their past. It would mean that the profit-oriented production of dubious art gains an influence that it certainly does not deserve. * 14 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 18 NO 2, APRIL 2002</page><page sequence="6">Now Available from the Superintendent of Documents... cc E a 0 c THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION'S Handbook of North American Indians Volume 13, The Plains The U.S. Government Printing Office's Superintendent of Documents has released the latest installment in the Smithsonian Institution's Handbook of North American Indians series: Volume 13, The Plains.
