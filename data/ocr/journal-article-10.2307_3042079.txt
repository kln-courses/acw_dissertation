<plain_text><page sequence="1">Towards a Map of Mis sed) Reading: The Pres- ence of Absence in The Color Purple [Some] receive the news of the death of God and the questionableness of authority with great enthusiasm. Like servants released from bondage to a harsh master or children unbound from the rule of a domineering father, such individuals feel free to become themselves. (Taylor 45)1 he Color Purple, Alice Walker's novel of black feminist awak- . ening, is also a model for the reconstruction of a black femi- nist literary tradition. If the existence of such a tradition had pre- viously been marked by the "white page" and historical silence, Walker subverts the space by embracing the absence. By attacking patriarchy (and patriarchal culture) at its Christian foundation, Walker celebrates the emptiness which is and has always been full. Working within and expanding the gaps, her work suggests new possibilities for the "sacred" as a tool in literary reconstruc- tion. Her novel is at once "holy," a celebration of "wholeness," and, indeed, a hole. It is the descent necessary for the resurrec- tion, the symbolic reversal of Christian tradition which makes last- ing change possible. If orthodox accounts of literary tradition and history treat in- fluence and "development" with simplistic and apolitical interpre- tations of "genius," contemporary theories, like that of Harold Bloom, retain an attachment to a patriarchal ground. Bloom's Freudian ordering of the literary universe, in a succession of anxi- eties and dissatisfactions in the rupture of communication be- tween fathers and sons, cannot provide even the briefest contex- tual outline for a black women's literary tradition.2 His "daemo- nic" reversal, however, can be appropriated: A "misreading," the creative failure of a son's writing/righting his anxiety, can be- come a 'mis(sed) reading," the creative success of the daughter's writing/rite-ing within the full emptiness of the page and history. Indeed, Paule Marshall has described her own literary output as writing those works that she would have liked to have read.3 Alice Walker has also textualized this 'desire" and has noted the forgotten power (and tragedy) of the silenced voice. Walker makes clear the relationship between the emptying of the literary space and the fulfillment of female identity through her novel's epistolary structure, which subverts the predomi- nantly male code of the Western literary tradition. This ground- ing celebrates an escape from history while retaining a faithful- ness to the transformative power of art. It is also significant that Western and African expressive traditions combine in the episto- lary mode, which is the literary/literal equivalent of call and re- sponse. Similarly, the revision of the sentimental tradition retains the importance of sororal connections and focuses attention on fe- male bonding. Walker's women transform their own lives as Alice James C. Hall is a graduate of the African-American World Studies Program at the University of Iowa.

Hall 89</page><page sequence="2">Walker transforms the tradition: Liter- ary codes and conventions are seen to parallel social and sexual relations. I would like to argue, however, that Walker's greatest accomplish- ment within The Color Purple is its claim for "space" through the critique of patriarchal theological structures that are, by implication, theocratic. If the adoption of the epistolary form subverts male codes of literary expres- sion, Walker continues the daemonic subversion, further directing her atten- tion to philosophical and political structures that are also limiting of black women. Even more compli- cated, perhaps, is her critique of an- thropomorphic thought and its cre- ative limitations. Walker's religious universe is "self-inventive"; it marks the clearing of debris through the em- brace of absence. Insofar as it directs attention to the creative process, Walker's text tends towards the realm of metafiction. It is indeed an anti- story: anti-patriarchal, anti-sexist, anti- Western, etc. But it is not an act of ni- hilism or desperation, not a celebra- tion of the end but of beginnings. It restates the power of literary creativ- ity in a profoundly social manner. XX Talker's novel begins with a threat: 'You better not never tell nobody but God. It'd kill your mammy" (3). The irony of the triple negative goes unrecognized, and the chief significance of the voicing lies, perhaps, in its threat to the matriar- chal bond. The emergence of a voice of challenge could result in the disrup- tion of the mother-daughter covenant. The threat (based upon the sexual vio- lation of the female) cannot be ac- knowledged through a cry for help or even sympathy. Celie must turn to- ward a personal, but distant, God. Celie's "Dear God" marks not only the emergence of a literary form (the epistolary novel) but also a ritual form (prayer). Walker immediately (if somewhat cryptically) directs our at- tention toward the efficacy of this rit- ual form: In Celie's "I am," Walker si- multaneously deletes/revises the pres- ent tense of the verb to be and the Bib- lical self-designation of the Hebrew God. This radical, yet subtle, transfor- mation is highly suggestive. Its dele- tion may signal a passionate turn from the Biblical religious tradition in which many black women have his- torically found self-definition. Equally as crucial, however, is Walker's em- powerment of her seemingly impot- ent protagonist. The "word" has been spoken; the refuge of the traditional ritual (and literary) form is temporary. Celie has also asked for a sign. At this point in her narrative she per- ceives herself as powerless, and looks for external authorization. Although writing God, she is unable to right her situation. Somewhat immediately, however, the beneficence and the righ- teousness of this God is called into question. "My mama dead" (4), Celie tells us in her next letter, despite her attempts to satisfy the demands of her father's curse. The victim of incest, Celie had told her mother upon the birth of her child that it was "God's" (4). Destructive patriarchal power is associated with God even though this same power is Celie's textual partner. Walker thus begins the process of clearing. Her protagonist has (in the first two pages) spoken the unspoken (the "I am") and radically revised the mythic story of Christ's birth. Celie's path to selfhood involves the evapora- tion of patriarchal Christianity. Celie's marriage to Mr. __ contin- ues the pattern. Her husband, in a fur- ther reference to the Old Testament God, is also unnameable. This textual deletion signifies her "partner's" abso- lute distance, his inability to compre- hend her history and future. He per- ceives her as livestock, and denies her not only love but humanity. She dis- covers her lost child in the posses- sion of a "Reverend Mr. " (15). From no Mr. - will she receive "God help" (5). In retribution, Walker 90 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">ironically denies identity to the power- ful, whom she playfully makes into objects of ridicule; they possess ti- tles of pseudo-respect, but lack "Christian" names. It is from Nettie that Celie first learns that resistance is necessary: "You got to fight. You got to fight" (17). But as that lesson is first being learned, Nettie's safety is called into question because of Mr. 's ad- vances. Nettie begins their goodbye: I sure hate to leave you here with these rotten children, she say. Not to mention with Mr. _. It's like seeing you buried, she say. It's worse than that, I think. If I was buried, I wouldn't have to work. But I just say, Never mine, never mine, long as I can spell G-o-d I got somebody along. (18) Celie's response is highly ironic, both in terms of her "never mine" com- ment and the silence of her respon- dent. It is true that that bond can never be hers. But Walker makes clear where the true bond should be. Their goodbye is completed: I say, Write. She say, What? I say, Write. She say, Nothing but death can keep me from it. She never write. (18) The connection (a "literary" one) is based upon female ties. And what is of greatest significance is that Celie must learn to be patient with Nettie's silence; she must discover that there never was a silence, that the nexus was interrupted. The literary space is full. It is also significant that Celie her- self seems to sense something. The sal- utation of her next letter is not "Dear God" but "G-o-d" (19). While clearly a reference to Nettie's farewell, the ex- pression also explores the "white spaces" between the "letters." Walker's revision of the textual form (of the generic convention) exposes the ritual partner as artifice. Although Celie must endure the indignities of her life without Nettie's support and aid, Celie's familial uni- verse is not to be without female nur- turance. Harpo's marriage to Sofia in- troduces Celie to an alternative mode of coping. Sofia "modifies" the re- quirements of marriage and child rear- ing. She rebels against the authority of her own father, and she is unwilling to behave deferentially to any man. Sofia's rebellion becomes a cause for Celie to reflect: I think bout this when Harpo ast me what he ought to do to her to make her mind. I don't mention how happy he is now. How three years pass and he still whistle and sing. I think bout how every time I jump when Mr. - call me, she look surprise. And like she pity me. (34) Jealous of Sofia's autonomy, and un- comfortable with her pity, Celie sug- gests that Harpo beat her. Harpo's lack of success in taming Sofia and her own conscience conspire to make her realize her "sin." Not even "think[ing]" about the Bible (37) re- lieves her anxiety. Sofia's confronting Celie with the fact of her betrayal leads to her consid- ering a new possibility. Celie tells Sofia how she perseveres: Well, sometime Mr. git on me pretty hard. I have to talk to Old Maker. But he my husband. I shrug my shoulders. This life soon be over, I say. Heaven last all ways. You ought to bash Mr. - head open, she say. Think bout heaven later. (39) Sofia's suggestion participates in the clearing of the patriarchal theological ground that is part of Celie's imprison- ment. Outright rejection of the future- oriented strategy is difficult, yet Sofia's combative personal style is not appropriate for Celie. Still, the sugges- tion introduces levity into a confronta- tional situation. It provides an occa- sion for the establishment of female bonds through the introduction of a maternal art form: TOWARDS A MAP OF MIS(SED) READING 91</page><page sequence="4">Not much funny to me. That funny. I laugh. She laugh. Then us both laugh so hard us flop down on the step. Let's make quilt pieces out of these messed up curtains, she say. And I run git my pattern book. (39) Whatever Sofia's contribution to Celie's enlightenment, it re- mains for Shug Avery to disrupt her world view radically. Shug, Mr. 's blues-singing lover, is clearly a threat to the patri- archal establishment, as the preacher signifies by taking Shug's "condition for his text" (40). Shug's lifestyle is a rejection of the values of the Christian-based com- munity, and suggests both marginalization and sur- vival. Despite her horrible condition when she enters Celie's household, she finds a way to endure: Ain't nothing wrong with Shug Avery. She just sick. Sicker than anybody I ever seen. She sicker than my mama was when she die. But she more evil than my mama and that keep her alive. (43) Despite Shug's "evil," her entrance into Celie's life represents the emer- gence of a new religious conscious- ness: 'I wash her body, it feel like I'm praying" (45). And surprisingly, Shug's presence seems to lessen the tension between Celie and Mr. their co-commitment to her health marks a new understanding in their relationship. Shug's presence also marks Celie's ability to conceptualize things differently, to imagine another real existence: 'First time I think about the world" (52), Celie considers, in clear opposition to the "other- worldly" orientation that Sofia has warned her against. Shug's attentions to Celie are cru- cial to Celie's emergent self-identifica- tion. Shug helps to make Celie aware of her own sexuality, and ironically "redefines" her as "virgin" (95). Signif- Walker's creative genius is the revision of vision, ask- ing us to see alternatively, to see where we have not seen before. icantly, Shug as "writer" draws atten- tion to Celie. Her "Miss Celie's song" punctuates her importance in Celie's growing self-awareness: "First time somebody made something and name it after me" (65). Still, Shug's contribu- tion to this naming and liberating pro- cess is limited. Like So- phia, Shug cannot provide Celie with her distinctive individuality. But by en- couraging Celie to provide this answer for herself and to reject the Biblical injunc- tions, Shug, like Sophia, participates in the theologi- cal clearing. There is still much rad- ical redefinition to be done. When Sofia gets into trouble for "sassing," Celie imagines a dramatic solu- tion: ... I think bout angels, God coming down by chariot, swinging down real low and carrying ole Sofia home. I see 'em all as clear as day. Angels all in white, white hair and white eyes, look like albinos. God all white too, looking like some stout white man work at the bank. Angels strike they cymbals, one of them blow his horn. God blow out a big breath of fire and suddenly Sofia free. (80) But Celie, Shug, and Harpo's mistress Squeak do not wait for this solution. They conspire to have Squeak con- front the warden in the hope of using her past to gain favor for Sofia. While their plan has limited success, it is their decision to combat patriarchal power with black female solidarity that is noteworthy. Their ability to "conspire" is significant; their "plot" is Walker's. The silence that is framed in otherworldly hope is replaced by a worldly female bonding. C elie's discovery (with Shug's as- sistance) of Nettie's letters marks the radical turning point of the 92 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">marks the radical turning point of the novel. Hidden by Mr. - (now named Albert), the letters are the pow- erful connecting metaphor for the re- construction of a black feminist liter- ary tradition. The text and the tradi- tion have never been missing. They have been disguised and sequestered because of the letters' liberating power. Albert's desire to "keep" Celie, to shape her for himself, to pro- scribe her existence, is most power- fully expressed in his attempts to break sororal bonds through the de- nial of a textual connection with Net- tie. The discovery of the letters, a product of ongoing self-redefinition, further promotes that process. Nettie writes in one of her first let- ters: I remember one time you said your life made you feel so ashamed you couldn't even talk about it to God, you had to write it, bad as you thought your writing was. Well, now I know what you meant. And whether God will read letters or no, I know you will go on writing them; which is guidance enough for me. (110) The artifice of Celie's writing struc- ture is revealed; "God" functions as a sardonic surrogate partner in the si- lence created by the very patriarchal power it represents. This "revelation" produces a most dramatic change in Celie's character; Shug must try to convince her not to kill Albert, in a rage even Sofia can't conceive: Don't kill, she say. Nettie be com- ing home before long. Don't make her have to look at you like us look at Sofia. But it so hard, I say, while Shug empty her suitcase and put the let- ters inside. Hard to be Christ too, say Shug. But he manage. Remember that. Thou Shalt Not Kill, He said.... But Mr. - not Christ. I'm not Christ, I say. (122) Celie distances herself not only from the "Christ[ian]" response, but also from the tradition itself. The convinc- ing part of Shug's argument is that Celie should not risk severing her tie to Nettie. The appeal to "Christ" is an appeal to an old rhetoric that has little hold upon Celie any more. Walker powerfully challenges her reader (and herself) in the demytholo- gizing of tradition by making Nettie a missionary. However, Nettie's experi- ence in colonial Africa, rather than being a retreat, further unravels the ties between institutional Christianity and black oppression. Nettie's letters tell of the power of being faced with "the Olinka God" (131), and of physi- cal and cultural destruction. The nec- essary ignorance of imperialism and the new vision of cross-cultural per- spective make Corrine and Samuel ap- pear provincial. Nettie's faithfulness in the face of such inconsistency and violence requires a radical reorienta- tion. The "rules," it seems clear, have changed, and this shift is linked to Nettie's tie to Celie. Nettie does recog- nize the negative power of the voca- tion she represents, and distances her- self accordingly. The "fact" of her one- way correspondence with Celie seems to speak to a gap in her call. "I would give anything for a picture of you, Celie," writes Nettie. ". . . the picture of Christ which generally looks good anywhere looks peculiar here" (135). Nettie has had to redefine her pur- pose: My spirits sort of drooped after being at the [Missionary] Society. On every wall there was a picture of a white man. ... We are not white. We are not Europeans. We are black like the Africans themselves. And that we and the Africans will be working for a common goal; the up- lift of black people everywhere. (115) Celie, similarly, ceases to write to God when she learns from Nettie that "Pa is not our Pa!" (150). While liter- ally representing the unraveling of Celie's complicated genealogy and the removal of the stigma of incest, this statement symbolically marks their joint recognition of the superfluous TOWARDS A MAP OF MIS(SED) READING 93</page><page sequence="6">demands of a restrictive theocracy. The Christian "father" is not their fa- ther, not their spiritual reservoir. But, as Nettie warns (". . . unbelief is a ter- rible thing" [158]), a retreat into nihil- ism is not the answer. Celie must re- learn belief in a way that replenishes the spirit as it redefines the self. Shug also recognizes the danger in absolute rejection: Just because I don't harass it like some peoples us know don't mean I ain't got religion. What God do for me? I ast.... She say, Miss Celie, You better hush. God might hear you. Let 'im hear me, I say. If he ever listened to poor colored women the world would be a different place, I can tell you. She talk and she talk, trying to budge me way from blasphemy. But I blaspheme much as I want to. (164) Celie's claiming the power of the curse is significant. It is the most dra- matic form of radical revision, but also the most dangerous.4 Shug's and Nettie's attachment to some "form" of a god makes clear that Celie's anger endangers her bond with them; an ab- solute negativity could shut them out. Celie herself recognizes the risk: All my life I never care what peo- ple thought bout nothing I did, I say. But deep in my heart I care about God. What he going to think. And come to find out, he don't think. Just sit up there glorying in being deef, I reckon. But it ain't easy, trying to do without God. Even if you know he ain't there, try- ing to do without him is a strain. (164) Celie and Shug try to renegotiate an identity and existence for "God." Shug's lesson for Celie includes recog- nizing that "God" isn't necessarily to be found in the institutional church, nor should "its" image be old, white, and male. Most radically, Shug rejects anthropomorphic conceptions com- pletely: Here's the thing, say Shug. The thing I believe. God is inside you and inside everybody else. You come into the world with God. But only them that search for it inside find it. And sometimes it just mani- fest itself even if you not looking, or don't know what you looking for.... It? I ast. Yeah, It. God ain't a he or a she, but a It. (166-67) Shug's rejection is the action that makes possibility; hers is a signifyin' theology that clears the way for Celie's selfhood. It reveals that Celie's writing has not been directed out- ward to a distant, uncaring entity, but inward, satisfying her own creativity. But Celie must still act for herself. If Shug's lesson has provided a fur- ther opening, Celie must enter it, and claim her inheritance. Well, us talk and talk bout God, but I'm still adrift. Trying to chase that old white man out of my head. I been so busy thinking bout him I never truly notice nothing God make.... Man corrupt everything, say Shug. He on your box of grits, in your head, and all over the radio. He try to make you think he every- where. Soon as you think he every- where, you think he God. But he ain't. Whenever you trying to pray, and man plop himself on the other end of it, tell him to git lost, say Shug. Conjure up flowers, wind, water, a big rock. But this hard work, let me tell you. He been there so long, he don't want to budge. He threaten lighten- ing, floods, and earthquakes. Us fight. I hardly pray at all. Every time I conjure up a rock, I throw it. Amen (168) Shug's ironic use of the orthodox ac- count of the Genesis story becomes a tool in Celie's liberation. "Man" has corrupted the creation, and Celie must resort to conjuration to protect herself.5 The "Amen" that ends Celie's account is a powerful one. It has been conspicuously absent from her other letters ("prayers") despite their traditional form. The "Amen" is not a note of ritual assent, but its nega- 94 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="7">tion. This a-men indicates the power of the "specified" rather than consensus. If conjuring provides the psychic power to prevent Celie's regression into total subservience, the 'curse" is the radical negation that makes self- hood possible. "It's time to leave you and enter into the Creation," (170) she tells Mr. _. More powerfully still: I curse you, I say. What that mean? he say. I say, Until you do right by me, everything you touch will crumble. He laugh. Who you think you is? he say. You can't curse nobody. Look at you. You black, you pore, you ugly, you a woman. Goddam, he say, you nothing at all.... I'm pore, I'm black, I may be ugly and can't cook, a voice say to every- thing listening. But I'm here. Amen, say Shug. Amen, amen. (176) Mr. 's inability to understand "what that mean" becomes definitive of a separate tradition of voice and text. Celie's curse brings havoc upon the patriarchal household, and makes a claim for her own space within cre- ation. Her acknowledgment of Mr. 's disclaimer negates its power and rejects its attempt to define appropriate roles and standards for black women. Fi- nally, Shug's recitation of the dissenting a-men reminds the reader of the the- ocratic ground being cleared. But Celie's curse is affirmative as well as negating. It instigates a new order. Not only is the restoration of Celie's family imminent, but signifi- cant changes in character are also pro- moted. We are told of Mr. 's new grooming habits and work ethic. Harpo's relationships with Sofia and his father are improved. We are even told of Harpo's going to sleep with his father in order to keep him company (191). Symbolically, the curse pro- vides the motivation for the lamb to lie down with the lion, while it liter- ally continues to revise gender roles. Now Celie's troubles can be con- fronted in a different way. When Shug is about to leave her for a young man, Celie responds, "I write" (212). As Shug's explanation becomes more desperate, Celie's response becomes like a chant, and Walker again directs our attention to the value and func- tion of the hidden tradition. The voice that empowers the curse also pro- motes and defines the tradition. Celie's "I write" (and, perhaps, I right) begins to provide the reader with ac- cess to that map of mis(sed) reading. XX Talker's clearing of the theolog- ical ground has not been ap- proved of universally. Indeed, the publication of her latest novel, The Temple of My Familiar, has heightened criticism that Walker has adopted a mushy New Age philosophy to con- front a historical Christianity that has misled and misplaced black women. Gerald Early may have been Walker's harshest early critic when, in respond- ing to The Color Purple, he suggested that Walker is guilty of a "fairly dim- witted pantheistic acknowledgment of the wonders of human potential that begins to sound quite suspi- ciously like a cross between the New Age movement and Dale Carnegie" (272). Such criticism would be appro- priate if Walker claimed her novel to be "real" in the mode of either Toni Morrison or Richard Wright. But Walker may more correctly belong in a tradition of black mysticism, with Rebecca Jackson, Jean Toomer, and Howard Thurman as ancestors, and Henry Dumas as contemporary.6 In- deed, Early goes too far when he sug- gests that ... what Walker does in her novel is allow its social protest to become the foundation for its utopia. Not surprisingly, the book lacks any real intellectual or theological rigor or coherence, and the fusing of social protest and utopia is really nothing more than confounding and blun- dering, each seeming to subvert the reader's attention from the other. One is left thinking that Walker wishes to thwart her own ideologi- cal ends or that she simply does not TOWARDS A MAP OF MIS(SED) READING 95</page><page sequence="8">know how to write novels. In es- sence, the book attempts to be revisionist salvation history, and fails because of its inability to use or really understand history. (273; em- phasis added) Early protests too much, and begins to be cast in the role of offended de- fender of the patriarchal ground. Walker has made no claim as an histo- rian; her self-identification as "me- dium" suggests that The Color Purple is clearly meant to be outside of the historical realm. Early is correct, per- haps, when he suggests that Alice Walker does not know how to write novels-at least novels directed or shaped by a male and Western para- digm. Walker is exploring the possibil- ities in the text as sacrament. "Profit- less play," suggests Mark Taylor, "can overcome the unhappy consciousness of the historical agent" (4). Walker's book is not "closed"; rejecting the telos of the historian for the "pur- poseless" wandering/wondering of the blues woman, The Color Purple in- vites the play of surfaces, the inter- pretation of interpretation. It dis- misses history to revise the present. To have access to a map of mis(sed) reading is to encourage a particular kind of historic consciousness. The challenge which confronts individuals interested in the establishment of a black feminist literary history is the necessity of enacting reconstruction and imaginatively identifying new historical categories, constructing the- ories of influence and theories of indi- vidual creation. Walker addresses this theoretical dilemma. Despite the im- portant contribution of The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers, Barbara Christian's Black Women Novelists, or even the work of the Afro-American Novel Project at Boston University to our de- sired historiography, we must also recognize the contribution of Walker's fictional transgression. What work can a new catalog of lost texts do towards the comprehension of black women's creative writing if we cannot also think through the problem of absent readers? If our historiographical model is to be complete, it must ac- knowledge a range of literary activi- ties and desires; it must document and imagine writers and readers, per- haps even texts, written and dreamed. Walker recognizes the wound in- flicted by canonical edict: literary si- lence, despite richness of artistic in- stinct, of human desire to creatively alter the world, immediate and dis- tant. Her response is to subvert the pa- triarchal and racist dimensions of our culture of the word by questioning tradi- tional theological and theocratic struc- tures, while retaining through playful revision the interrelationship of speech, selfhood, and creativity. The creative disorganization of our very no- tion of tradition, while retaining com- mitment to humanistic values and in- quiry, is no small feat. Despite a postmodern theology-an embrace of ab- sent fathers-Walker has no desire to do away with meaning. She is clearly a woman of letters. he reintegration offered in Celie's final letter draws atten- tion to the conjure; it suggests to the reader the closing of a special period of time and space. "Dear God. Dear stars, dear trees, dear sky, dear peo- ples. Dear Everything. Dear God" (249)-not only is there psychic recon- ciliation, but also a sense of ritual com- pletion, consistent with the notion of the text as sacrament. The reader emerges from the realm of the imagin- ary with a sense of new possibility. Most significantly, "Walker creates a new literary space for the black and fe- male idiom within a traditionally Western and Eurocentric form" (Hen- derson 18). We begin to get some idea as to how to inscribe and describe the newness-ways of celebrating genius. And as Celie discovers the letters, and recovers her "missed reading," we are directed toward a map of tradition. 96 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="9">This accomplishment is best marked by Walker's quote of Stevie Wonder: "Show me how to do like you/ Show me how to do it." Walker's attention to the vernacular song makes clear the ways in which her text is not a passive imitation of the Western literary form. The Color Purple is a demand for recogni- tion, for the acknowledgment of revi- sion within missed reading. There is irony in the source-the black and blind (literally "vision"-less) singer asking to be shwn as opposed to told. Walker's creative genius is the revision of vision, asking us to see alternatively, to see where we have not seen before. Notes 1Taylor's deconstruction of traditional theological conceptions is crucial to my reading of Walker. 2Dianne F. Sadoff's 'Black Matrilineage' offers an important consideration of the value of Bloom's work, particu- larly The Anxiety of Influence, for a black women's literary tradition. Sadoff also considers the value of Gilbert and Gubar's The Madwoman In the Attic. I wish to argue that the notion of 're-reading' or 're-voicing' can be appropri- ated without adopting the psychoanalytic model (and controversy). Sadoff's work demonstrates the danger inherent in confronting that tradition: Spending an inordinate amount of time delineating the complexities of one 'school' over another can divert attention from the insight's constructive potential within the literary tradition. More helpful are the essays by Marijorie Pryse and Hortense Spillers in Conjuring, by Mae G. Henderson in Sage, and most especially by Walker herself (see 'Saving the Life That Is Your Own,"Zora Neale Hurston: A Cautionary Tale and a Partisan View,' and 'Looking for Zora' in Gardens). 31t must be made clear that what is being asserted here by both black women writers and myself is not the non- existence of a rich tradition of literature by black women, but rather a matrix of circumstances which have in the past made (conspired to make?) unlikely the placement of black women's literary stories in the hands of a black female readership. Benignly, one might assert that a map of mis(sed) reading is an analytical tool for the use of sociologists of literature; more powerfully, I think, it should be seen as a interpretive tool for the use of sympathetic critics in the reconstruction of the unseen tradition. Again, as noted above, Alice Walker's own writing on models is crucial. 4Mark Taylor makes ciear why it must be dangerous: 'In a place of a simple reversal, it is necessary to effect a di- alectical inversion that does not leave contrasting opposites unmarked but dissolves their original identities. Inver- sion, in other words, must simultaneously be a perversion that is subversive. Unless theological transgression be- comes genuinely subversive, nothing fundamental will change. What is needed is a critical lever with which the en- tire inherited order can be creatively disorganized' (10). 5Pryse and Spillers have made specific use of Walker's use of conjuration in titling their text on black women's lit- erary tradition. I would further suggest that this is a clue to a further revision of Bloom's uratios'; for a black women's tradition of revision we might substitute signlfyin' for clinamen, dues for tessare, steppin'out for kenosis, spirit pos- session for daemonization, curse for askesis, and the blues for apophrades. Of course, any such revision would need to challenge more substantively Bloom's assumed historical and psychoanalyticconnections. Walker's challenge (and my own, I hope) is more than an assault on Eurocentric paradigms-it is a needed reassertion of American pluralism againstobjective theory. 6On Walker's knowledge of Rebecca Jackson, see "Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson' (Gardens 71-82). One of the most disappointing aspects of the most recent assault on Walker has been the inability of critics and commentators to contextualize her more recent concerns with reference to African-American religious history.
