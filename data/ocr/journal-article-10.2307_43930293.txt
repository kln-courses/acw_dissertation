Grummel University of Washington IN English A recent ("Of Gods article and in Men College in English ("Of Gods and Men in the Iliad" CE 14, 391-395), Professor Wallace E. Anderson, after some preliminary discussion of the diffi- culties which the mythological world of the gods presents to students who are getting their first taste of classical literature in one of the general edu- cation courses, addresses himself to the problem of the nature and func- tions of the gods in the Iliad. With his general conclusion that the gods are woven deeply in the texture of the poem and serve a multiple func- tion no one could reasonably quar- rel. The specific statement that the gods are "to a large extent respon- sible for both the moral tone and the tragic effect of the poem," how- ever, seems to overemphasize the moral influence of the gods on the actions of men. Homer is conscious of the manifold aspects of the deities which he uses, and uses them artisti- cally to serve various ends; but only rarely are the moral aspects of their relationship with men mentioned. The problems, both moral and the- ological, which fully anthropo- morphical gods raise for Plato do not concern Homer. Professor Anderson faces fully the moral character of the gods them- selves in stating his argument: "Al- though the gods themselves often are capricious and deceitful, they never- theless demand among men strict adherence to oaths, proper regard for and mercy to suppliants, respect for the aged and the dead, and obed- ience to the gods. There are some actions among men that may show lack of aidõs , respect, but violation of the rules mentioned above repre- sents hybris , overweening arrogance and lack of respect toward the gods, which is punishable by ate" He then proceeds to demonstrate that these considerations are central in the in- terpretation of the Iliad. Agamemnon brings the plague on the Achaeans because of the hybris he shows in re- fusing to accept ransom from Chry- ses in exchange for his daughter. Achilles is guilty of lack of aidõs in quarreling with Agamemnon, and Agamemnon is likewise guilty for his lack of proper respect for an infer- ior. Finally Achilles, in refusing to yield to the entreaties of the embassy sent to him by Agamemnon, is guilty of both aidõs and hybris . This interpretation of the Iliad has many upholders in our day, and a Greek of the fifth or fourth century would probably find little that is objectionable in it; but I doubt very much if Homer's audience had such a nicely worked out system of moral philosophy. Homer's artistic purpose is to prejudice the reader against Agamemnon and in favor of Achilles, so he presents Agamemnon as insist- ing on retaining his prize against the unanimous opinion of the army that the girl should be returned to her father, who had come offering shin- ing ransom. The girl was part of the spoils of war; Agamemnon was un- der no obligation to allow her to be ransomed. Chryses, the priest of Apollo, does not urge such a tenuous argument in his prayers to the god. His relationship with the god is al- most completely contractual and businesslike. He had roofed over a pleasant temple in Apollo's honor and he had burned the fat thighs of goats and cattle on the altars; for this the god is now asked to make some repayment. The question of moral- ity does not obtrude itself until after the plague has risen. Then it would have been a violation of the heroic code for Agamemnon to refuse to do that which would alleviate the suffering of the Achaeans, since he has certain obligations as the leader of the expedition. To prove that Achilles was moral- ly in the wrong in refusing proper respect to Agamemnon we would have to determine exactly what duty and what respect a sceptered king owed to the marshal of the host. This is an interesting question, but sufficient evidence for solving it is not given in the poem. Though Dio- medes does accept a rebuke from Agamemnon later, he does not hesi- tate to speak boldly to Agamemnon when the success of the expedition is at stake. Other leaders also use harsh words to the king. A better case might be made that Achilles was in the wrong in refusing the pleas of the envoys sent to him. But even here he is under no moral compul- sion to accept. Achilles held his hon- or high, and he wanted the surrender of Agamemnon to be abject and the Achaeans' need of him to be acute. Here Agamemnon is attempting to bargain with him, even though he is willing to pay a very high price for cooperation. There is no viola- tion of the heroic code in Achilles' desire that Agamemnon's humiliation be as public and as complete as he feels that his has been. Certainly Achilles has no sense of having com- mitted a moral wrong, even after he has heard of the death of Patroclus. His closest approach to such a senti- ment is an outburst against strife and wrath: "May strife be destroyed ut- terly from the midst of gods and men, and wrath, which causes even a very wise man to be embittered, which, far sweeter than trickling honey, increases like smoke in the breasts of men. Even so did Aga- memnon, king of men, stir my bile." Though he recognizes the evil con- sequences of the quarrel and wishes that such consequences had not been produced, he does not admit any moral guilt nor does he think that he had been or should be punished by the gods. The case against Agamemnon is somewhat different. He himself uses moral terms in discussing the quar- rel but disclaims personal responsi- bility: "I am not blameworthy, but Zeus and fate and the fury walking in darkness who placed wild atē in</page><page sequence="2">Page 78 THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK my heart in the assembly on that day when on my own authority I took away the prize of Achilles. But what could I do? A goddess accomp- lishes all things, the august daughter of Zeus, destructive Atē, who mis- leads all." Agamemnon admits an error, not a wrong. There is no feel- ing that he has sinned against the gods in any way or that the gods will take any notice of his action. The notion that the gods will send retribution for wrongdoing is severely limited in the Iliad. Men do expect the gods to punish those who violate the sanctity of oaths and those who give "crooked judgments in the market place and drive justice out, heeding not the regard of the gods." Here we have an adumbration of a later ethical system in which the gods will be regarded as the agents of moral retribution, but there is no development of this system in the Iliad. In fact, the few moral functions which the gods possess do not weigh too heavily upon them. It is the gods who instigate Pandarus to violate the solemn obligations of the truce. Hera, moreover, does not fear to swear falsely by earth, heav- en, the Styx, the head of Zeus, and her bridal bed. Though Zeus knows that she is perjuring herself, he merely smiles at the situation. We cannot use the conduct of the gods as a moral touchstone in judg- ing the human actors, because it is far inferior to that of the heroes. From the time of Xenophon of Col- ophon to the present there has been substantial agreement on this. We need not be concerned about their relationships with one another, re- prehensible though these be at times. But we do have the right to expect moral gods to deal justly with men. But even here their conduct is not only irresponsible but also malevol- ent. If the gods are really respon- sible for the moral tone of the Iliad, how do we account for the action of Zeus in sending a deceptive dream to Agamemnon, of Athena in inciting Pandarus to break the truce, of Hera in displaying a constant and almost insane malevolence toward the Tro- jans? The answer, of courre, is that the gods are not the guardians of the moral order nor the dispensers of justice to men. Their relationship with men is based quite nakedly on their power. They interfere in hu- man affairs entirely capriciously, without concern for the moral worth of the human actors. Their interference is frequent, for men are almost entirely dependent on the gods. The heroes generally recognize that their actions and even their thoughts are divinely inspired and that their greatest exploits are performed with divine assistance. Men take for granted that the gods will either help or hinder them: "Now Menelaus has conquered me with the help of Athena; some day I will conquer him, for we have gods on our side also," says Paris. Nestor speaks in like fashion to Diomedes: "For now Zeus, the son of Cronus, bestows glory on that man today; later he will give it to us again, if it be his will." This divine machin- ery which Homer inherited and de- veloped is used as the exigencies of the plot demand. Without the inter- ference of Athena, for example, it is difficult to understand how a man as sensitive to honor as Achilles would submit to having his prize taken. In like manner the activities of the gods throughout the poem are explicable on artistic grounds. To understand this, however, we must note that the gods are not al- ways presented in the same guise. Sometimes they are fully developed anthropomorphic deities, as is The- tis when comforting Achilles; some- times they are extensions of psy- chological factors within a man or mere metaphors to explain motiva- tion; sometimes they are the great cosmic forces; and sometimes they are the grotesque and comic deities of an earlier mythology. In Homer, as in Euripides, we have the gods presented with Protean complexity. To understand the function of the gods in the Iliad we must follow the advice of the critic who stated: "Sound criticism demands that each allusion and each attribution be con- sidered in the light of all that can be learned regarding the artistic func- tion of the episode and the problems of technique which it involves" (G. M. Calhoun, "Homer's Gods - Pro- legomena," TAPA 68, 1937, p. 22). Despite the interference of the gods, men are not mere puppets jerked this way and that by strings manipulated from the heights of Olympus. They can and do exert themselves to accomplish their ends, even in the face of divine opposition. Hector goes to battle with the sure knowledge that "the day will come when holy Ilium shall fall, and Priam, and the folk of Priam of the goodly ashen spear." The Greeks continue the battle even when it is obvious that Zeus is aiding their enemies. Thus the action is allowed to continue on a human level despite the interference of the gods. The whole motivation of the Iliad is hu- man. The quarrel between Agamem- non and Achilles allows the will of Zeus to be accomplished, but the human agents, not the gods, are responsible for the quarrel. Apollo furnishes the occasion, and that is what Homer means by the lines: "What god then set these two to contend in strife? The son of Leto and of Zeus." We would certainly not use Milton's lines: Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt? Th' infernal Serpent . . . to relieve Adam and Eve of respon- sibility. The moral code, too, which gov- erns the conduct of the Homeric heroes, is completely human. It does not depend on the example of a just god or on the sanctions of reward or punishment from the gods either in this life or in the next. This code is obviously less rationalistic than the moral philosophy of Plato, but it is not completely dissimilar. As we can see from the speech of Agamemnon quoted above, the obscuring of the intellectual faculty is blamed for his arrogant actions. He does not say that he chose the evil way in prefer- ence to the good, but that his affec- tive faculties had overweighed his rational faculties because the god had sent Atē, the spirit of blind madness. His hybris is the result of error, of the lack of intellectual clarity. The equilibrium of the soul was dis- turbed. Morality for the Homeric hero consisted in seeing clearly at all times and in keeping the affective faculties under the control of the mind. There was little danger that such a moral ideal would result in a cold and unemotional character, for it was precisely the tendency of the Homeric hero to indulge in violent emotion that needed restraint. The specific requirements of the code can be gleaned throughout the Iliad. Paris is the outstanding ex- ample of failure to abide by the code; he had violated the laws of hospitality, his courage is question- able, and he indulges his own desires even at the expense of bringing suf- fering on the whole city. Ajax, son of Telamón, gives instinctive obed- ience to the code. Odysseus is per- haps the best example of instinctive and intellectual adherence to it, but our own moral predispositions tend to make us less sympathetic toward him. Diomedes and Hector can be used as symbols of the heroic code in action. Much of the morality of the Ho- meric hero is purely personal, and, at times, goes far beyond the require-</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK Page 79 THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK Entered as second class matter Oct. 7, 1936, at the post office at Oxford, Ohio, under the act of March 3, 1879.

Outstanding examples of this are Priam's tenderness to Helen when she appears at the walls of Troy, Hector's selfless patriotism and consideration for his family, and Helenus' devotion to the gods. Achilles, too, has an aesthetic appre- ciation of candor and truthfulness which is almost unique in Homeric society. "Zeus-born son of Laertes, wily Odysseus, I must speak this word straight out without regard for consequences, just as I think and as it will be accomplished, so that you may not sit and coax me from this side and that. For hateful to me as the gates of Hades is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another." This speech, follow- ing upon the attempt of Odysseus to persuade him to rejoin the host, is not an insinuation that Odysseus is deceiving him - the speech of Odys- seus was straightforward enough - but an explanation of, almost an apology for, his own candor. Achilles has a personal code which differs from that of Odysseus, who often lies out of exuberance and for the sheer joy of it. Even Andromache is impressed by Achilles' code: "My father godlike Achilles slew, and completely destroyed the populous city of the Cilicians, high-gated Thebe. He slew Eetion, but he did not despoil him, for he had respect for him in his heart, but he burned him in his well-wrought armor and heaped a mound over him." The hero's acceptance of the gen- eral code and his individual exten- sion of it is motivated by the desire for glory. This life is at best short, and death constantly hovers over him. Life is valuable because it af- fords a man an opportunity to win glory among his peers and renown forever; thus the nobility of the hu- man spirit transcends the miserable fate which is the lot of all men. As Professor Owen expresses it (E. T. Owen, The Story of the Iliad , New York, Oxford University Press, 1947, p. 248): "The splendour of human- ity and the sorrow of humanity here meet under the shadow of death and are reconciled in a noble and uni- versal compassion that has no touch of resignation but is exhilarating, making the sorrow part of the splen- dour, plucking the splendour out of the sorrow." The success of the American Clas- sical League's teacher placement service depends upon the extent to which prospective employers are informed about this service. Heads of classical departments and directors of placement bureaus are earnestly requested to refer to the Director of the Service Bureau any prospective employer whose requests for teachers of Latin or Greek they themselves are not able to fill. Teachers in the schools or colleges are also requested to report any vacancies of which they may become aware.
