<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marx and Proudhon: A Reappraisal of Their Relationship Robert Hoffman* Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon were acquaintances for a short time when they both lived in Paris. Apparently they were friendly then, but later Marx engaged in energetic polemics against Proudhon and wrote one of his major works, La misère de la philosophie, as an attack upon him. This antagonism, originating in personal and ideological differences, was played out in the internal conflicts of socialist organizations, where Marx's chief opponents were followers of Proudhon. The French anarchist died in January, 1865, just after the foundation of the First Socialist International, and had little part himself in the controversy. This conflict between Proudhonists and Marxists led to the early demise of the First International in 1872 and continued to plague the socialist and labor movements long afterward. Given these circumstances, the issue of the two men's relationship and possible influence on each other has been the subject of numerous investigations and has become a basis of partisan polemic as well as an object of interest to scholars. Proudhon's more outspoken supporters have claimed that Marx acquired many of his most important ideas from the anarchist.1 The concepts most often claimed as due to the latter are surplus value, historical materialism, and the class struggle. Proudhon has been supposed to be * The author is Instructor in the Department of History and Political Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 1The most sustained argument for this claim is by Arthur Miilberger, Zur Kenntnis des Marxismus (Stuttgart, 1894), 19-34. 409</page><page sequence="2">The Historian either the originator of these notions2 or the stimulus responsible for Marx's conception of them.3 The Frenchman has also been held responsible for the young Marx's "conversion" to socialism.4 On the other hand, the German claimed to have taught Hegel to Proudhon,6 an explanation of the latter's peculiar "dialectic" method which has of course been accepted by Marxists.6 A few writers have also thought that Proudhon may have been somewhat influenced by Marx on the issue of historical materialism.7 An English historian, having examined the whole question and finding what he believed are close similarities in texts he quoted from each, concluded that they probably learned much from each other.8 Although the breadth of the gap between the final theoretical positions of the two men seems plain enough, there are some points at which their writings appear similar. Moreover, their differences were exaggerated by Marx for polemical purposes. These elements of similarity have contributed to the debate over mutual influence, although some scholars have insisted that any similarities in their ideas are less important than their differences in temperament, ■ Ibid..; Jeanne Duprat, Proudhon — Sociologue et moraliste (Paris, 1929), 288-96; Karl Diehl, P.-J.

The conclusion developed here is that the differences between the two men were too great for them to influence each other significantly. A common interest in socialism and the philosophy of Hegel brought them together briefly, but that was in reality a rather vague basis for close intellectual bonds. They had little else. Paris in the mid-1840's was a lodestone for German socialists, attracted by her revolutionary tradition, relative freedom, and celebrated socialist writers. Often they had been encouraged to leave Germany by unfriendly police. Many Germans gathered in Paris, and Marx joined them there in November, 1843. He planned with Arnold Ruge to found and edit a new journal, the Deutsche-Franzôsische Jahrbiicher; they tried to gain the collaboration of French socialists in this venture, but were unable to do so. The only issue of the review appeared in March, 1844, with just one non-German contributor: Mikhail Bakunin. The Germans were preoccupied with sectarian contro versies over idealist philosophy about which French socialists • Édouard Dolléans, "Le rencontre de Proudhon et de Marx (1843-1847)," Revue d'histoire moderne, XI (January-February, 1936), 15-26.

Furthermore, these Germans were usually insistently atheistic, coming as they did from a philosophical milieu of left Hegelianism and Feuerbach's ideas of an anthropomorphic God. Among French socialists some form of religious or pseudo-religious sentiment was common and militant opposition to religion in all forms was not. In France "rejection of religion" primarily meant anticlericalism and deviation from Catholic orthodoxy; in any case the abstractions of modern metaphysics had little or no pertinence for a French socialist's attitudes toward religion. There were other reasons for the non-participation of the French in this new journal, but their great differences from the Germans in philosophic approach seem to have been the most fundamental bar to collaboration. A partial exception was Proudhon. Since he was agnostic as well as anticlerical, German atheism did not repel him as it did many other French socialists. While he was in the main ignorant of the intricacies of left Hegelian controversy, he was fascinated by what he knew or thought he knew of German idealism. His reputation among socialists had been established by his mémoires on property. Published in 1840-1842, they had eloquently presented radical views on a wide range of issues, and Marx was to praise them extravagantly in Die Heilige Familie (1845).12 Apparently Marx and Ruge wanted Proudhon's col laboration for their review. Ruge gave Marx the task of contacting Proudhon, but the latter was unavailable, being in Lyon preoccupied with his studies and writing and very active in his work as a commercial agent for an inland shipping firm there. He was in Paris briefly in the spring of 1844, but he and Marx probably did not meet until shortly after Proudhon returned to Paris for a prolonged 13 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Die Heilige Familie, in Marx and Engels, Werke, II, 23-36, 39-56, 165, 166.

The outlooks and interests of the two men were in reality quite different, as subsequent developments were to prove, but initially their superficially common interests brought them together. On the one hand Proudhon was, as suggested above, receptive to German philosophy and presumably eager to discuss it. On the other, Marx apparently had at that time much admiration for Proudhon and his ideas. After all, Proudhon was celebrated and Marx's senior by nine years, while the latter was just another little-known intellectual in exile. Their mutual belief in the primacy of economic relationships was a good initial foundation for their acquaintance, although the very different way they regarded this primacy would soon divide them irreconcilably. In these months economics was a principal subject in their conversations, according to the later comment of Friedrich Engels: ". . . in Paris the two of them often discussed economic questions all night long."13 One can learn almost nothing from Proudhon about his association with Marx. He did not mention Marx at all in works written for publication. He wrote two letters to him and mentioned him just twice elsewhere in his published correspondence; his voluminous carnets include only four mentions of Marx, the first not until 1847, and none of the four revealing much. During the period when the two men were seeing each other in Paris, Proudhon made few if any entries in his carnets.14 Marx, on the other hand, wrote a few days after Proudhon's death: u Friedrich Engels, "Vorwort zur ersten deutschen Ausgabe Das Elend der Philosophie," in Marx and Engels, Werke, IV, 558. "Proudhon kept these notebooks from 1843 to 1860. Eleven in number, they were unavailable to most of those writing about Proudhon, but after the death of his daughter in 1947 they were deposited in the Bibliothèque Nationale (nouv. acq. franç., 14265-14275). Carnets de Proudhon, 2 vols. (Paris, 1960-61), includes all of the carnets through February, 1848. There are a few undated pages which may have been written at any time between lune, 1844, and February, 1845. None have anything to do with Marx. 413</page><page sequence="6">The Historian During my stay in Paris, 1844,1 entered into a personal relationship with Proudhon. I mention it here because I am somewhat to blame for his "sophistication," as the English call the falsification of goods. During long, often overnight debates I infected him to his great harm with Hegelianism, which because of his ignorance of the German language he could not study in the usual way. What I began Herr Karl Grun continued after my expulsion from Paris. As a teacher of German philosophy he also had the advantage over me that he understood nothing of it himself.15 W. Pickles has expressed doubt that the two men knew each other well, suggesting that there is no corroboration for Marx's reference to intimate acquaintance.16 However, Pickles ignores the testimony of Engels quoted above and attaches significance to the failure of others, such as Arnold Ruge and Alexander Herzen, to mention the supposed association. To argue from the lack of evidence is uncon vincing, particularly when Herzen had not yet emigrated from Russia at the time in question. Granting that nothing in Proudhon's writings suggests close acquaintance, the same can be said with respect to many other men whom he definitely knew well. Engel's comment, written after the death of his collaborator, could have been based on Marx's claim of close acquaintance, but in the absence of other evidence there is no good reason for doubting these statements of Engels and his mentor. Marx's remark about "infecting" the Frenchman with Hegelianism helped to create a controversy. From whom did Proudhon learn about Hegel's philosophy? Claims have been advanced for Marx, Grun, and for Mikhail Bakunin as well.17 By his own testimony Proudhon had not read u Marx, "Uber P. J. Proudhon. . . ." 25-32, first published in Der Social Demokrat, Nrs. 16-18 (February 1, 3, and 5, 1865). M Pickles, 240-41. " Droz, 139-41, suggests all three.

Except for his work on aesthetics, none of Hegel's writing was translated into French until after Proudhon's death. Yet Proudhon fancied that he knew Hegel well and that he had carried on the Hegelian mode of philosophy to new heights of perfection and final successful application to the scientific understanding of society.18 He felt that Hegel's philosophy was one of the most important influences on his thought. "My true masters," he said in August, 1848, "I mean those who have caused fecund ideas to be born in me, number three: first the Bible, then Adam Smith, and finally Hegel."19 The content of Proudhon's works makes it apparent that his appraisal is not valid, particularly with respect to Hegel. Nevertheless, his reiterated pretensions led many to take them more seriously than is warranted and stimulated the controversy over the responsibility for his initiation into the Hegelian mystery. The belief that Karl Griin taught Hegelianism to Proudhon does not seem to have originated with Marx's remarks in the passage quoted above but in an article written in 1848 by Saint-Réné Taillandier,20 whose mistaken transla tion of a comment by Griin was followed by later writers. Actually, in the passage Taillandier quoted, Griin had written that he confined his instruction of Proudhon to Feuerbach and related current German critical philosophy. He stated that Proudhon already understood Hegel per fectly,21 a judgment which lends credence to Marx's low "Proudhon, letter to Bergmann, January 19, 1845, Correspondance de P.-J.

Sainte-Beuve's correction of Taillandier's mistake was ignored by a number of later writers. 415</page><page sequence="8">The Historian opinion of Griin's own comprehension. Griin, whom Marx despised, probably arrived in Paris and met Proudhon around October of 1844; he was expelled from France by the police in April, 1847. Proudhon suspected Marx's friends Heine and Weill of responsibility for this expulsion and may have thought Marx was involved also.22 Marx himself had been expelled and left for Brussells on February 1, 1845. They never met again. Griin and Proudhon, however, remained friends until the latter's death twenty years after. Shortly before coming to Paris Griin had been converted to the philosophy of Feuerbach by Moses Hess, and he intended to play the role of Feuerbach's apostle in France. He felt that Proudhon was in effect a disciple of Feuerbach's humanism without knowing it, and thus he tried to enlighten him on the subject. However, the claim of Griin to have been Proudhon's Privat-docent in the passage referred to above excited the Frenchman to say with irritation in a letter to Marx that he had learned nothing whatever from Griin.23 Though the latter probably did limit his "education" of Proudhon to Feuerbach and related current criticism, it is unlikely to have had significant effect. While Proudhon's notions of anthropomorphism in religion bear some resemblance to Feuerbach's, they predate the friendship with Griin and show no obvious change after having met the German apostle. The Frenchman's entire intellectual approach differs so greatly from Feuerbach's that the latter could have had little effect on him. In fact, Proudhon directly attacked the thought of Feuerbach as wholly inadequate.24 In any event, the evidence does not warrant the conclusion that Griin 23 Proudhon, Carnets, IV, 162.

Mikhail Bakunin also is supposed to have played some part in Proudhon's Hegelian education. The two men first met at about the same time that the latter made the acquaintance of Marx. The Russian tried to enlighten his French friend by preaching Hegel to him, as he had earlier with the Moscow intelligentsia. His understanding of Hegel seems to have been shallow, but he was a magnificent speaker with an overwhelmingly engaging personality. Whether a missionary for Hegelianism or anarchism, whether philo sophically sound or dubious, this remarkable Russian was a powerful and influential figure wherever he wandered. Alexander Herzen's memoirs give the following anecdote about incidents which took place several years later. Until then I had not seen much of Proudhon; I had met him twice at the lodgings of Bakunin, with whom he was very intimate. Bakunin was living at that time with A. Reihel in an extremely modest lodging at the other side of the Seine in the Rue de Bourgogne. Proudhon often went there to listen to Reihel's Beethoven and Bakunin's Hegel — the philosophical discussions lasted longer than the symphonies. They reminded me of the famous all night arguments of Bakunin with Khomyakov at Tchaadayev's and at Madame Yelagin's, also over Hegel. In 1847, Karl Vogt, who also lived in the Rue de Bour gogne, and often visited Reihel and Bakunin, was bored one evening with listening to the endless discussions on phenomenology, and went home to bed. Next morning he went round for Reihel, as they were to go to the Jardin des Plantes together; he was surprised to hear conversation in Bakunin's study at that early hour. He opened the door — Proudhon and Bakunin were sitting in the same places before the burnt-out embers in the fireplace, finishing their brief summing-up of the argument begun overnight.25 While the night-long discussions between Marx and Proudhon may have been similar to this one, it is hard to imagine that 25 Alexander Herzen, My Past and Thoughts, trans. Constance Garnett (London, 1924), III, 219. 417</page><page sequence="10">The Historian they were as convivial or intimate. Actually, neither Proudhon's German friends nor Bak unin introduced him to Hegel. In Qu'est-ce que la propriété? (1840) he attempted to employ the Hegelian dialectic technique at one point; in his correspondence he mentioned Hegel as early as 1840 and discussed him at length in 1842.28 During the following years his conception of Hegel and a pseudo-Hegelian dialectic played an important role in his thought and writing. While he could not read the German's works, a number of commentaries on and critiques of them had appeared in French,27 and Proudhon derived an elementary and apparently faulty conception of Hegelian philosophy from these, a conception which was not much improved by Marx or Bakunin. Proudhon's "dialectic" derives more from the ideas of Charles Fourier and Immanuel Kant (he did read Kant in translation) and from his own mind than it does from Hegel, the books about him, or the conversations with Marx, Bakunin, and Griin. Marx was fair in saying that Proudhon had only the language, not the dialectic of Hegel. The truth of the matter would appear to be that Proudhon built his "dialectic" philosophy while affected by a number of influences, with Hegelianism a very minor one.28 Having for the most part fixed his concepts, he was made further aware of the ideas of Hegel by Marx and others. These ideas were too alien to him and he was too resistant to " Qu'est-ce que la propriété? (Paris, 1926), 324-25; Correspondance . . . , 1, 248, and II, 47. A letter to Tissot in Correspondance . . . , II, 230-32, dated December 13, 1839 and discussing Hegel, is cited by several writers to indicate a still earlier acquaintance. This date is clearly an error: it should be 1846. "For these sources, see Armand Cuvillier's introduction to Proudhon's De la création de l'ordre dans l'humanité (Paris, 1927), 19-20, and Cuvillier's "Marx et Proudhon," 165-66. 28 While developing his dialectic method, Proudhon stated that he had constructed this system at a time when he had scarcely heard of Hegel. De la création de l'ordre . . . , 212. Although the evidence does not permit accepting this disclaimer at its face value, Proudhon's method must have been devised when he knew virtually nothing of Hegel. 418</page><page sequence="11">Marx and Proudhon any persuasion or conversion to be much affected by the preaching of Hegelianism. However, he believed he discovered a close relation between his thought and Hegel's; no doubt this pleased him and encouraged him in his Hegelian pretensions. At the time he and Marx were having their discussions, he wrote: I can not yet judge the kinship between my metaphysics and the logic of Hegel, since I have never read Hegel; but I am persuaded that it is his logic that I am going to employ in my next work; now, this logic is only a particular case or, if you wish, the simplest case of my own.29 The whole controversy over Hegelian influence on Proudhon is a fine example of scholars brewing a tempest in a teapot. In the 1840's he tried very hard to develop a scientific method for discovering the truth about society; dissatisfied with the method he developed, he did not try to improve or use it as a serious means of analysis after 1848, although occasionally he employed its language. The view of society in Proudhon's mature work is one of dynamic balance and interaction between opposing interests of individuals and groups. Here his sociology approaches that of Marx, but he stresses dynamic equilibrium with little of the concept of creative dialectic process so vital to the German. Because of Proudhon's emphasis on achieving balance in social conflict rather than its elimination, his philosophy can be called dialectical, but this dialectic is clearly quite different from that of Marx or Hegel. This should be obvious from an intelligent reading of the three philosophers, but the superficial similarities can be misleading. When Marx left Paris after just a few months' acquain tance with Proudhon, he had not yet turned against the anarchist. Shortly before his departure he had written high praise of the Frenchman in a section of Die Heilige Familie, " Proudhon to Bergmann, January 19, 1845, Correspondance . . . , II, 176. 419</page><page sequence="12">The Historian which was published in March, 1845. For the time being Marx regarded Proudhon as the best of French socialists. Both men dreamed of an international association of socialists. The subject appears often in Proudhon's carnets, especially from 1845 to 1847. Despite his light regard for the leaders of French socialism and his polemics against them, he was quite serious about wanting to unite them and apparently had few misgivings about doctrinal differences interfering. It is possible that the two men talked in Paris about an international association or about a renewed attempt to establish a Franco-German socialist review. In May, 1846 Marx wrote Proudhon from Brussels explaining that he had often meant to write before and apologizing for not doing so. He invited participation in a sort of international committee of correspondence organized by himself with Engels and Philippe Gigot. The proposal envisioned extensive communication and cooperation between German, French, and English socialists.80 The project was a reasonable one, amicably presented. However, the letter had a postscript, probably composed by Marx,31 which violently denounced Proudhon's friend Griin as "a sort of charlatan who would carry on a commerce in modern ideas" and plainly attempted to provoke enmity toward him. This addition could not have encouraged acquiescence by Proudhon. His reply was polite in tone, but reserved in substance. He agreed that the proposal was a good one and that he 30 Marx's letter and Proudhon's reply are reproduced in an appendix to Proudhon's Les confessions d'un révolutionnaire (Paris, 1929), 432-37. The letter signed by Marx is written in another hand, possibly Gigot's. It was probably copied from Marx's original because his writing was difficult to read. 31 This postscript was signed by Gigot and has been taken to be his composition but is more likely to be Marx's. For a discussion see the editor's introduction to Marx's La misère de la philosophie (Paris, 1950), 420</page><page sequence="13">Marx and Proudhon would participate but said that he lacked the time to contribute much or often. Furthermore, he made the reservation that he had to maintain his independence of position. He deplored German ideological dogmatism, which by implication he attributed to Marx, and called for the reception of open and free debate in this organization by all wings of socialist opinion. Presumably he had in mind Marx's quarrel with Griin when he wrote this. Though a ready polemicist, Proudhon criticized opponents with little of the animosity or dogmatism characteristic of Marx. He added that he no longer shared the belief in the necessity of revolution for social change and now felt that such change could be accomplished without resorting to force. Finally, he sought to reconcile Marx to Griin. This answer to Marx's overture plainly shows the division in temperament and intellectual outlook between the two, and from the other's point of view it was hardly better than an outright rejection. This quality of rejection must have angered him, and the nature of Proudhon's objections should have made it clear to Marx that here was an ideological foe with whom he would never reach agreement. Although Proudhon sent Marx a copy of his Philosophie de la misère32 when it was published the following fall, there was, as far as is known, no further communication between the two men.33 Karl Griin had for some time been preaching Proudhon's ideas in socialist circles. Engels saw that he had achieved success in this effort among German workers in Paris, of whom there was a large number. Already opposed to Griin's advocacy of Feuerbach, Marx must not have liked to see him adding to the influence of a possible rival in socialist 33 Proudhon, Système des contradictions économiques, ou philosophie de la misère, 2nd vol. (Paris, 1845). 33 Apparently Proudhon wrote Marx a long letter shortly before the book's issue, announcing its forthcoming publication and asking for his criticism, but the letter seems not to have been preserved. Marx, "Uber P.-J. Proudhon . . . ," 27. 421</page><page sequence="14">The Historian politics. Marx waged a vendetta against Griin, of which the bitter postscript to his letter to Proudhon is just one example. Daniel Halévy has suggested that this postscript attack on Griin was deliberately calculated to divide Proudhon from him in order to stop Griin's advocacy of Proudhonism.34 Sending the Philosophie de la misère to Marx for criticism was not the most felicitous way for Proudhon to propagate his ideas. Even if Marx had not been personally antagonistic already, he would still have found the book's contents quite opposite to his own ideas. As Proudhon himself later admitted, this work had many faults, despite its sometimes eloquent rhetoric and occasional penetrating insights. Marx could only have had contempt for its weak points, as well as for those that diverged from his own views. He determined to make the book the object of general derision; though he did not immediately succeed in this, eventually Proudhon came to be known best in the terms of Marx's judgment made in his La misère de la philosophie, also known as Anti-Proudhon. Marx feared that Proudhon's book would mislead the masses, or, to put it less generously, he feared that Proudhon might gain the ascendancy that he himself wanted in any socialist movement. However one rates the question of possible personal jealousy, clearly Marx sincerely thought it necessary to block the propagation of what he believed to be grave error. Since Proudhon's writing style was impressively powerful and he was already a celebrity, the danger he represented was especially serious. In December Marx wrote a lengthy letter criticizing the Philosophie de la misère to Pavel Annenkov, a Russian exile and liberal who was well-acquainted with Bakunin, Herzen, and many others on the left. This judgment is severe M Daniel Halévy, "Proudhon d'après ses carnets inédits," Hier et demain, Nr. 9 (1944), 40-42. 422</page><page sequence="15">Marx and Proudhon enough,35 but the book he worked on during that winter was to be his public statement and would cut much more deeply. Temperate and reserved criticism was never one of Marx's practices, but this polemic is especially thorough and vitriolic. He spared little in attempting to destroy Proudhon's reputation. La misère de la philosophie was published in Paris and Brussels in the summer of 1847, its title a clever parody of Proudhon's. In his avant-propos Marx adroitly damns Proudhon at the outset. M. Proudhon has the misfortune of being singularly misjudged in Europe. In France, he has the right to be a poor economist because he passes as a good German philosopher. In Germany, he has the right to be a poor philosopher because he passes as one of the strongest French economists. We, in our capacity as both German and economist, wanted to protest against this double error.36 Marx tries to demonstrate here that Proudhon is wholly incapable of abstract thought, that he understands neither Hegel's philosophy nor Ricardo's economics, that his idealism is hopelessly out of touch with reality, that his economic concepts are quite fallacious, that his individualism is all wrong, as is his hope of changing the social system without first destroying it, and that he does not comprehend the historical process. Marx's assault was so brutal that it may well have served to arouse more sympathy for Proudhon than rejection of his ideas. Very few copies were sold. While Marx's initial attempt to form an international socialist organization was not at first successful, when one was established it was very nearly dominated for some years by followers of Proudhon, just the turn of events that La misère de la philosophie was 36 Karl Marx, "Lettre à Annenkof sur Proudhon," Mouvement socialiste, XXXIII (1913), 141-54.

Only when Marx's later work and political activity gained him ascendancy did this book help to achieve the virtual eclipse of Proudhon's influence. In the years after 1847 Proudhon's name appears repeatedly, but in hostile reference, in the works and the correspondence of Marx and Engels. The judgment of Proudhon made by Marx just after the former's death37 was moderated only by being less vitriolic, even though it was a kind of funeral tribute which was to be published. Marx was a man who nurtured hate for opponents and his hostility to Proudhon seems to have been all the hotter because of the formidable character of the opposition. At the London Conference of the International Workingmen's Association in September, 1865, a Proudhonist delegate, Ε. E. Fribourg, wrote that Marx had told him then "how he had sworn a profound hate for P.-J. Proudhon for his anticommunist opinions; how in response to a chapter of this philosopher: la Philosophie de la Misère, he had victoriously responded with his book Das Capital, chapters of the Poverties of philosophy."38 Proudhon remained singularly silent in the face of the attacks, despite his usual readiness to join in polemical controversy. His marginal notes in his copy of La misère de la philosophie have been preserved.39 They reject some of Marx's statements and accept others or comment that he, Proudhon, had really said the same thing. These are the only specific replies to the criticism that the anarchist is known to have written. There is just one comment on "The letter to von Schweitzer quoted above. " Ε. E.

It is a tissue of scurrilous remarks, calumnies, falsifications, and plagiarism."40 ("One doctor Marx" seems a contemptuous way to refer to someone so well known to him.) In 1851 he did write with distaste of Marx, Ruge, and Griin as the presumed leaders of German socialism, calling their manifestoes empty and hare-brained.41 His carnets contain a few minor comments. After having read Marx's attack he interjected in his carnet that Marx is the "tapeworm of socialism."42 Shortly afterward he included Marx in a list of critics of his Philosophie de la misère.*3 Near the end of 1847 he mentioned Marx in an outburst against Jews, apparently inspired by suspected intrigues against himself and Griin by German Jewish émigrés.44 In 1848, in a list of proposed articles for his newspaper, Le peuple, Proudhon included "Dr. Marx,"48 but no such item was published. There are several possible explanations for Proudhon's surprising silence. The best is that he lacked the time to compose a thorough counterattack, for the next months and years were the busiest of his life. Still, one may ask why a reply was not sufficiently urgent for him to take the time from other activities. Possibly he recognized sufficient validity in Marx's criticism for him to be less eager to respond to insults, for Proudhon later admitted the weakness of his Philosophie de la misère. He may also have been reluctant to join in a brawl, for while he was a ready polemicist, he did not make vitriolic or insulting attacks on his opponents. Finally, it could have occurred to him that a published 40 Proudhon to Guillamin, September 19, 1847, Correspondance . . . , II, 267-68.

After all, the Philosophie de la misère was translated into German almost immediately, Marx's La misère de la philosophie not until nearly four decades later. The question of influence of Marx and Proudhon on each other, like many such questions, can not be answered with precision. Both had formed their dialectical concepts before coming into contact with one another, and there is no reason to believe that any further development of the dialectic of either man resulted from their relationship. The late, distinguished sociologist, Georges Gurvitch, wrote lengthy and provocative comparisons of their dialectics; his analysis could suggest that the "new wave" of socialist humanism may find in Proudhon's work a fruitful comple ment to the Hegelian and early Marxist writings to which so much attention is given.46 Although there is some affinity between Proudhon's dialectic and that of the young Marx, this is significant only when drawn out of original context. The use each made of his dialectic renders any affinity unimportant by comparison with the differences, as far as the two men themselves and their followers were concerned. Aside from the subject of dialectic philosophy, evidence indicating influence one on the other is too meager for confident conclusions. It is necessary to evaluate influence in the light of each man's whole philosophy. Some have suggested that Marx's concept of economic materialism affected the French anarchist; in support they cite a letter written by the latter at the time he was seeing the German,47 " Georges Gurvitch, Dialectique et sociologie (Paris: Flammarion, 1962), 73-156; Pour le centenaire de la mort de Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, mimeo graphed Cours Public, 1963-64 (Paris: Centre de Documentation Universitaire [1964], 8 et passim; Proudhon (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1965), 15-70; Les fondateurs français de la sociologie contemporaine: II.

Here Proudhon places unusual stress on the fundamental importance of determining facts about actual material conditions and avoiding reliance on moral norms as sole standards of judgment. However, these instances are rare and their stress is no more than a variation in emphasis from that of his regular position as a moralist who thought objective conditions were also important. Marx's approach here was too far from his own for there to have been substantial influence. Proudhon always regarded economics as he did all subjects, in essentially moral terms, as matters of justice. His fundamental standard of judgment was a set of principles about universal human rights. These were the personal rights of individuals qua individuals — liberty and equality conceived in most absolute senses. His ideas about economics, politics, society, and history were all determined by his judgments on how personal rights could best be served. Although Proudhon attempted to construct a "science" of society and history he could not do so, for his ideals would not allow the "necessity of objective conditions" to be recognized as the principal determinant of the social order. Empirical considerations could have no more than secondary relevance for this essentially idealistic philosopher. Marx's materialism and determinism could never have had more than superficial import for Proudhon. Even if he had fully understood Marx's dialectic, which he probably did not, he would have rejected Marx's view of history as something foreign to his whole way of thinking. He might have had some sympathy for Marx's views on alienation resulting from labor; in fact he did consider the problem but in a different way. He could not think about it in anything like the terms of Marx. If Proudhon spoke of the primacy of economic relationships, it was only because individual rights were limited or denied in the existing 427</page><page sequence="20">The Historian relationships. Capitalism was objectionable to him, but not because it might be obsolete as an effective means of production. The means of production were irrelevant except as they affected justice. While Proudhon like Marx sought revolutionary change, he was sceptical about the process of revolution itself. Not only did he see no historical necessity for it ever to occur, he was afraid that violent revolution would not substantially advance the cause of justice, whatever new socio-political order it established. Thinking of the revolutionary events in France of 1789-99 and 1830, and later those of 1848, he believed that revolution would become perverted into a travesty of its intended form. Successful revolution, if possible at all, could result only from the evolutionary transformation of the moral character and philosophy of all men. Though he sometimes hoped sudden revolts could contribute positively though partially to such a transforma tion, the Marxist dialectic of revolution could be no more acceptable to him than his evolutionary approach and moralism could be to Marx. Proudhon's intellectual premises were basically those of the French Enlightenment; he adapted everything else to fit preconceived notions. He did not study German meta physics in order to understand it on its own terms; he saw there only what he thought he could fit to his own essentially different preconceptions. In consequence, he had no real comprehension of German philosophy. He was capable of understanding neither Marx's philosophy nor the German metaphysics which gave it birth. With regard to Proudhon's supposed influence on Marx, it is known from Marx's writing and correspondence before 1846 that he had read and admired the French anarchist until then. It is reasonable to presume that the latter had a limited and indefinable effect on the formation of his basic outlook; so undoubtedly did a number of other writers, none of 428</page><page sequence="21">Marx and Proudhon whom could be called Marx's preceptor. The claim that he owed key concepts to Proudhon can not be accepted. Most of the similarities between their views are best described as superficial; comparison of texts indicating such similarities takes their ideas out of context, ignoring important differ ences. While the two men shared some elements of belief, these elements fitted in their mature systems very differently. Most of these shared elements were part of the common intellectual currency of contemporary socialism. Where the anarchist's ideas were unique they were generally odious to Marx. Marx liked Proudhon's Qu'est-ce que la propriété? (1840), and praised it even in the otherwise condemnatory letter written just after the anarchist's death. This praise resulted from Proudhon having made the usual socialist criticisms in an unusually eloquent and radical fashion. The book is credited with making Marx's thought more radical; since he praised it so highly, the work could have been more important here than other contemporary writing, much of which contributed jointly to the maturing of the young German's ideas. That is all that can be said for Proudhon's influence on Marx. To suggest that he derived or stole ideas from Proudhon gives unwarranted importance to the latter. Ideas like those in question do not spring to life uniquely and independently in the mind of one man, even a Marx or a Proudhon; they arise repeatedly in variant forms among different men who breathe in the same intellectual currents. After their break the German rejected Proudhon as a mere petty bourgeois publicist. The "petty bourgeois" label is dubious; he was a printer by trade and his background was as proletarian as it could be in the pre-industrial and provincial Franche-Comté where he grew to maturity. More over, he was a vehement critic of bourgeois liberalism. However, from the other's point of view these considerations were largely irrelevant. Proudhon's attitudes, focusing 429</page><page sequence="22">The Historian around his extreme individualism, were in the other's terms essentially bourgeois in character. For the purposes of polemic, Marx may have made his former acquaintance more of a devil than even his standards required, but he could not have seen in the French anarchist a congenial ally under any circumstances. His antipathy was a necessary conse quence of their divergent outlooks and needed no personal contact to precipitate it. The personal relationship of the two men was a transitory one. Marx was attracted to Proudhon by the latter's early writings, at a time when his own ideas were not yet fully developed and the glamour of the celebrated Proudhon could appeal to him. His ideas at the time may have had a certain affinity with the anarchist's, but any such connection would soon be far outweighed by other concepts of the evolving Marxist system. Proudhon was interested in German philosophy and so was drawn to the émigré briefly. When they became well-acquainted with each other they must have discovered that their personalities were far too different for friendship to grow and their ideas too different for an intellectual or political alliance. The Frenchman probably could have remained on amicable terms had not the other attacked him, but close associates they could never be. There was no real common ground between the two men and little basis for either to influence the other substantially. In the final analysis, it must be recognized that the abyss between Proudhon and Marx and between the ideologies of each was too broad for there to be much interaction across it. 430</page></plain_text>
