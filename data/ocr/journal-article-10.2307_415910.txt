<plain_text><page sequence="1">Metaphysical community: The interplay of the senses and the intellect. By GREG URBAN. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1996. Pp. xvi, 288. Reviewed by JAMES STANLAW, Illinois State University The first thing any red-blooded field-practicing real anthropologist or anthropological linguist will do when confronting any new ethnography is look at the back of the book to see which 'people' it deals with. Is it about 'MY people', friends or enemies of 'my people', or, even-God-forbid-does it concern itself with some obscure group on the other side of the world from 'my people'? In reading this work, my frustration in- creased-page after mounting page-when it became obvious that no quick answer to this natural query would be forthcoming. However, the reasons for this mystery became clear as I came to understand the logic underlying the 'metaphysical community' de- scribed in this fascinating and ambitious project. To sum it up in a sentence, this is a discourse-based study of an indigenous South American Ge-speaking group in southern Brazil. That said, however, several comments must be made. This is not your average mainstream anthropological writing nor is it standard discourse analysis of the kind most linguists might be accustomed to. Also, while this book is an extension in some ways of Urban's earlier work on Native American myth and ritual (1991), the present work is as much a statement on cross-cultural episte- mology as it is about western culture theory, semantics, and the philosophy of language.</page><page sequence="2">652 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 73, NUMBER 3 (1997) The main tenets of U's thesis go something like this: among the people described here, the epistemological principle at work is that what is immediately perceivable is not explicitly talked about; individuals can-and, indeed, are expected to-make their own private judgments about what is readily apparent to everyone. That is, there are no publicly accepted interpretations or narratives about the visible, auditory, or tactile world. 'It [the "real" phenomenological world] is not the subject of interpretation through the referential aspects of discourse' (215). Conversely, that which is NOT sensi- ble-that is, easily apprehended by the senses-is the subject of much discussion, debate, and interest. Thus, dreams, the world of the dead, and the 'land above sky' are main topics of conversation and the subject of much publicly circulating discourse. U describes specific instances of this kind of activity in a variety of situations including ceremony and ritual (Ch. 6, 172-214), social organization (Ch. 5, 134-71), kinship termi- nology (Ch. 4, 99-133), dreaming (Ch. 7, 215-40), and mythology (Ch. 8, 241-57). Those who know their history of philosophy and social science well-especially of the anthropological variety-will immediately recognize that many of these cases just mentioned correspond to critical theoretical issues and debates in the West as well. And this is the second part of U's project: to make the findings uncovered in this specific case study challenge the basic assumptions and premises that circulate in Western academic discourse. Ultimately, U asks what it means to mean. What are the relationships between named categories and mental categories? What are the relationships between perceptual experiences and presumed underlying realities (issues that have puzzled philosophers from the Greeks to Nietzsche). And, most importantly, how are these relationships talked about in culturally standardized ways? An example of the type of discourse analysis U uses is found in his examination of kinship. In the early part of this century, the eminent anthropologists Kroeber (1909) and Rivers (1910) debated for years about the nature of kinship terminology. Are kin terms, as Kroeber claimed, part of a Saussure-like language system in which they have no meaning except in contrast with other terms? (For example, 'brother' is opposed 'sister' as it contrasts on the basis of sex). Or does kinship terminology somehow reflect an underlying social structure 'out there' that is simply mirrored by language, as Rivers and other British social anthropologists argued? (For instance, I might call my biological brother and the son of my father's brother by the same kin term, thereby reflecting the fact that we are in the same lineage, tracing our relations through our male relatives.) But U shows us the limitations of framing the problem in either of these two ways. In the South American case he is describing here, kinship is not thought about in the same biological way as in Western anthropology. 'What is the word for father's sister?' makes no sense-not only because there is no word for 'word'-but also because kinship terminology here is not constructed like some genealogical chart. People were hard pressed to even figure out what the anthropologist was getting at, and to bring these terms together in this way was both unnatural and artificial. As U points out (105), 'a father's sister might be in one instance a no (if she is sufficiently older than you), in another instance nigie~n (if she is more or less the same age or younger), and in still another mi (if she happens to have been involved in piercing your lip or tattooing your thigh).' Clearly other factors (like relative age) are at work. Thus, those who see kinship as purely a language-internal system based on biology may be imposing regularities of their own that do not exist in the culture they are studying. That is, kinship is something to be 'heard' in everyday speech rather than 'seen' or discovered (81). So it is through looking at naturally occurring discourse, U says, that we find how kin terms are really used. For example, we find that kin terms can be used to introduce new participants in conversations. But because kin terms also carry expectations about</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 653 the relations between the old and new participants, they dictate how the following dis- course will unfold. These expectations, then, are remarkably similar to what sociologists and others would call 'role'. And this brings us back to the arguments made by Rivers (i.e. that kinship terms reflect underlying social categories which exist outside of lan- guage and lie in the realm of behavior). But U has just shown that it is precisely through these inner workings of discourse expectations that behavior arises. By examining at great length both conversations and the texts of myths, U makes a strong case that role expectations actually reside in discourse rather than in the behavior merely described by the discourse. The important thing, then, is that this explicit analysis of discourse discloses ideas in the local consciousness that other techniques miss or obscure, because of either methodology or preconception. For example, we might assume that social groups natu- rally exist and are always indigenously named (even if the group only calls themselves 'the humans' or 'the people' or whatever). The folks discussed here apparently do not do so. U shows that attributions like 'Kaingang' or other names just do not work, and the people here seem unconcerned about this. 'In asking people what they call them- selves, we assumed the existence of the object to be named. But what if the object itself is not similarly intelligible from the other side?' (44). 'Not every discourse tradition produces a consciousness of itself as a "culture"' (64). Thus, U ends up referring to them as simply the 'Indigenous Post-Ibirama' community, causing no small degree of frustration to the anthropologist, as I mentioned at the beginning of this review. In other words, group distinctions are not necessarily always made on the basis of language, geography, or ethnicity, as is often taken for granted in the western tradition. All in all, this very provocative book will give anthropologists and linguists alike cause to both cheer and cringe. In spite of all the great things, however, the ending does leave us feeling just a little disappointed. In keeping with interpretivist or post-modernist styles, in lieu of a conclusion, U often just slips into anthropomorphism ('And so, empiri- cism, you must cede your throne. . . . yet there is life in you' 257). The implications of his intriguing project are many, and deserve to be more clearly explicated for those who may have missed some of the more subtle and finer arguments in the middle of the text. There is much food for thought here, and any linguist or anthropologist or philosopher with even a passing interest in how discourse operates in an actual cultural context for the construction of meaning and reality would do well to look at the meta- physical community so marvelously described here.
