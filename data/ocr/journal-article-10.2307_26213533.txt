In the context of the Counter-Reformation the Catholic Church closely supervised printed literature. Papal bulls were issued against proscribed books, and in dices were drawn up containing lists of prohibited books (Index Li brorum Prohibitorum), which also included Hebrew books.1 In addi * Bar-Dan University, 52900 Ramat-Gan, Israel - email (baruchsl@mail.biu.ac.il), (preborg@ mail.biu.ac.il). 1 A number of indices were published in Franz H.

The most important of the in dices of Hebrew books is "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" by Domenico Yerushalmi (Domenico Gerosolimitano).2 This is the most comprehensive index, both from the standpoint of the number of books mentioned in it, and also from that of the broad range of years in which the books dealt with in it were printed. In 1596, Domenico Yerushalmi completed the first updating of the index which was based on a prior composition whose author is un known and which was not printed until recently and was preserved in manuscripts only. Domenico Yerushalmi was an apostate rabbi, originally named Shmuel Vivas befor e his apostasy.3 Domenico was born in the land of Israel in Jerusalem, in 1555, and was educated in the Galilee, presum ably in Safed, where he studied Talmud and Kabbala and also officiat ed as a rabbi and rabbinical court judge (Dayan). He also studied medicine, and at an early age was appointed physician to the Turkish Sultan, Murhat III, and occupied this post for some 16 years. When he was 38, on 6 August 1593, Domenico converted to Christianity. Af ter his conversion, like many apostates in his day, Domenico worked as a censor of Hebrew books and continued to do so until 1621, a tion and the Venetian Press 1540-1604, «Journal of Modem History», XL VII, 1975, pp. 48-65; Id., Printing and Censorship, in The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosopy, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1988, pp. 25-53; Rudolf Hirsch, Pre-Reformation Censorship of Printed Books, «Library Chronicle», XXI, 1955; Id., Bulla Super Impressione Librorum 1515, «Gutenberg Jahrbuch», XL Vili, 1973, pp. 248-251; George H.

Prebor, F rom Jerusalem to Venice. The Life of Domenico Yerushalmi, his works and his activity as a Censor (heb.) (at the press).</page><page sequence="3">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 5 year before his death. Domenico was one of the most prominent figures who worked in the service of the Catholic censorship, and was one of the most active censors. According to his testimony he censored over 20,000 copies of Hebrew printed books and manuscripts. We find evi dence of his work as a censor in many Hebrew printed books and manuscripts which have survived from this period. In addition to his work as a censor Domenico also engaged in writing texts in Hebrew whose aim was to convince the Jews of the supremacy of christianity. The book contains an introduction which deals with the principies of censorship and contains twenty general instructions for expurgation, followed by a detailed discussion of 426 Hebrew books, and in addi tion an index of titles with reference to a further 46 books which ap peared in the index only, so that altogether the book discusses 476 Hebrew books. The book contains various quotes from these Hebrew books which contain passages deemed harmful to the Christian faith, which the writer considered unacceptable and recommends their ex purgation, or sometimes gives suggestions for emending them. The book demands extreme rigor in the work of expurgation, and to this end he used the expression "requires study", as is written at the end of the introduction to the book: «And ali this requires great study with understanding and knowledge, and particularly where idolatry is mentioned». The reference to the Hebrew literature in the book is de tailed and very thorough, and the book's author was well-versed in it.4 "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" refers in its instructions to specific éditions, and was apparendy designed to serve as a manual to assist the censors in censoring books that were printed, but the principies which appear in it could also be applied to other books and manuscripts, in particular by the rules given in the introduction. The aim of this paper is to examine the extent of the use and in fluence of "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" and its impact on the external and inter nai censorship in the Hebrew literature. The Problem of Censorship in Hebrew Literature The techniques of censorship directed towards the Hebrew litera ture evolved concurrendy with and as a part of the development of church censorship as a whole, and by the same bodies. Italian Jews who wished to save their books operated in two directions: on the one 4 The book was first published at G. Prebor, "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" cit., together with a de scription and detailed analysis of the dissertation (heb.).</page><page sequence="4">6 SHIFRA BÂRUCHSON-ARBIB AND GILA PREBOR hand, by the opération of an internai censorship of the Hebrew print ed books, and, on the other hand, by lobbying with the Pope and the Church leaders to ease the instructions for confiscating the books and forbidding the printing of the Talmud. This lobbying led to the opéra tion of external censorship.5 In order to avoid punishment in clashing with the Church, the Italian Jews undertook self-censorship of Hebrew books. The Church authorities tried to impose censorship on ali the books in order to prevent the printing of heretical literature, and in this con text the Hebrew books were also required to undergo examination prior to their printing, but they were not very successful in censoring the latter. Although increased rigor is noticeable in the expurgation of some of the books printed in Venice, but since the imprimatur testify ing to the book's approvai was found only in a few of the books print ed in the sixteenth century, we can conclude that the printers were not accustomed to presenting ali the books for examination.

Church supervision of the execution of the early censorship was not stringent, but the subsequent internai Jewish censorship left traces in Hebrew literature that cannot be erased. The censorship which the printers took upon themselves in the préparation of new éditions af fected the printed text, since the printers had to take into account the needs of their customers and their wishes, and they didn't want to have in their homes books which would be subject to confiscation by the Inquisition or which would be altered or arbitrarily disfigured. Therefore, the printers engaged in prior censorship of the texts. As mentioned earlier, the lobbying by the Jews of the Pope and Church leaders to ease the instructions with regard to confiscation of the books and prohibition of printing the Talmud, led to the external censorship activity. One of the concessions won by the Italian Jews was the introduction of censorship of books in manuscript and print possessed by the Jewish public, as an alternative to confiscation and wholesale destruction of almost ali the books they possessed. The term "purification" ("Ziquq") is the commonly used term in this context, parallel to the Latin term "expurgatio".7 To carry out the expurgation the Church put at the disposai of the communities censors, most of them apostates and experts in the Hebrew language, and the commu nities undertook to pay their fees. The involvement of the Jews in the purification work arose from the fundamental approach of the Church that the Jews were responsible for the "forbidden literature" in their possession. The owners of the Hebrew books were required in the name of the Inquisition to hand them over to the censors who kept them in the lo cai office. Hiding of books was punished by their confiscation and a 6 See M. Benayahu, Haskama Vereshut in Venetian Printed Books cit., pp. 167, 198-209, 229-235; Id., Hebrew Printing in Cremona, pp. 74-79. The approvai printed in the Cremona printing press was apparently that of the censor and not that of the secular authorities as was the case in Venice. The multiplicity of approvals towards the end of the century can be found in di Gara's books, see A. M. Haberman, The printer Juan di Gara and the list of books of his printing press 1564-1610, Jerusalem, Habermann institute for literary research, 1982, p. 12 (heb.). The approvai was called "Con licentia dei Superiori" and in Hebrew "Rishayon Haserara". 7 On the use of the term 'expurgation' see I. Sonne, Expurgation of Hebrew Books, «Bul letin of the New York Public Library», XLVI, 1942, pp. 977-981; M.

The books that were collected were examined by the censors, who destroyed the books that were forbidden and pun ished those who kept them. The books that were of a controversial na ture were expurgated and returned to their owners with the approvai of the censor. The Jews had to cover the cost of the censorship - the salaries of the censors. Therefore the censors were financially dépen dent on the Jews, and this may have influenced their activity. The censorship procedure included the erasing or replacing of ali the paragraphs which, in the view of the censors, contravened the principies of Christianity, its customs and rites, or those which con tained blasphemy, heresy or errors. When the work of expurgation of the book was finished, the censor wrote a short approvai in Latin or in Italian, sometimes also in Hebrew, or in Italian and Hebrew. The approvai was written for the most part on the last page of the book and sometimes on the title page. Proof of the activity of the various censors can be found in a large number of manuscripts and printed works which have survived until the present day, and in them can be seen erasures with ink, emenda tions, detaching of page and the signature of the censor. The most im portant and active of the censors was Domenico Yerushalmi, who op erated between the years 1595-1621.8 On 27 August 1595 the Bishop of Mantua, Francesco Gonzaga, ap pointed Lorenzo Franguello, Domenico Gerosolimitano and Alessandro Scipione as censors of the Jewish books in Mantua. At the same time the members of the community were instructed to bring their books to the Inquisition office to undergo expurgation. The community was al so obliged to pay a high salary, 400 scudi, to the expurgating censors.9 During his work in Mantua, Domenico Yerushalmi completed the first updating of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". It appears that the many 8 A list of the various censors is found in an appendix in Popper's book, The Censorship ofHebrew Books cit., pp. 131-144. 9 The document of the bishop's order was published by Stern.

In spite of the extensiveness of the expurgation campaign of 1595 there were apparendy those who maintained that the censor ship had not been rigorous enough in examining the books, and ten years later, in 1605, ali the books possessed by the Jews of Mantua and the surrounding région were reexamined.</page><page sequence="7">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 9 books which came under his scrutiny were the basis for composing the book. AlMS OF THE RESEARCH As we have said, the censorship activities were divided into two main components: the first component is the overt external censor ship, expressed by the action of the various censors, the tangible signs of which have been left in Hebrew manuscripts and books which have survived unti! the present day. The second component is hidden from the eye and it is more difficult to detect, but it is apparently far more significanti the internai censorship which the Jews conducted on their own initiative, in the wake of the Church's policy and their fear that the external censorship would include such acts as the destruction, the confiscation and the burning of books. The central questions which arise in this research are: To what ex tent was the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" used in the external censorship activi ty? And what was the book's impact on the printing of the Hebrew books and on the shaping of the reading culture? Or in other words: What were the characteristics of the self-censorship of the text and whether the printers refrained from printing certain texts.10 Methodology These issues have been examined in depth. In order to answer the first question a statistical analysis of the use of "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" in the ongoing work of the censors has been carried out, and the emen dations in the copies of the censored books mentioned in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" were examined. In order to answer the second question, the influence of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" was examined through a quali tative criticai analysis of several compositions which were printed after the writing of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" and mentioned in it, in order to assess the extent of its influence on the internai censorship. The statistical analysis was carried out on the basis of a study of copies of censored books which were preserved in library collections 10 As stated, the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" indicates in its instructions forbidden and problematic contents in the Hebrew books and how to deal with them. Nonetheless, the book does not pro hibit the use of these books or their printing, and there are many books which the "Sefer Ha Ziquq" even approves of unreservedly and asserts that there is nothing in them requiring proof reading. There is only one book which the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" disquaMed outright. This book appears only in the index and it says of it: «The Chronicles of France is almost ali bad and bitter».</page><page sequence="8">10 SHIERA BARUCHSON-ARBIB AND GILA PREBOR in Israel and throughout the world. And the criticai qualitative analysis was conducted by a comparison of several éditions of books discussed in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" and which were printed in the seventeenth century in Italy. Finding and discussion A. The use of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" in the external censorship activity Scholars are divided in their views regarding the question of the use made of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" for the purposes of external cen sorship. In the opinion of Sacerdote and Porges, the "Sefer Ha Ziquq" was used little or not at ali.11 Berliner notes in his article: «Over the years they did not take the rules of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" into considération, but the censors acted arbitrarily and as they saw fit».12 Despite this, Berliner quotes from a written request of the Jewish community in Rome to the Supreme Inquisition Tribunal, from about 1738, to return to it books that had been taken from it on 28 may 1731. From the letter it emerges clearly that the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" was known and familiar, and that use was made of it: If you see fit to permit the Jews restoration of their right to use their books, after they have already been expurgated and entended according to the détails of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". This book conforms to the censorship in structions of an anonymous Capucin convert, who began it in 1594, and its continuation was done in 1596 by Father Domenico Yerushalmi, who gave the book to a cardinal from Cremona who was at the time a commissioner of the Holy Office. After that, His Eminence Father Ridolfi, the court minister in the Holy, appointed the every eminent Father de Trevi,13 the preacher to the Jews in Rome - to the work of expurgation, namely to examine the books of the Jews, compare them with the aforementioned "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", and sign them. After a while, the letter of appointment for censoring the He brew books with the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" was given to Father Joseph Cionti, al so a preacher of Christianity to the Jews, and in that same book instruction for censorship five hundred or more Hebrew books. They followed this cus tom until 1641; and this book is today in the Vatican library n. 273 and Bar 11 G. Sacerdote, Deux index expurgatoires des Livres hébreux, «R.E.J.», XXX, 1895, p. 276; N.

Popper, The Censorship ofHebrew Books cit., pp. 102,145. And see below, in two books which we found with his signature there is great correspondence with the requirements of the "Safer Ha-Ziquq".</page><page sequence="9">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 11 tolocci wrote about it and so we are very willing to copy the above-mentioned "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", or to make it a permanent rule, so that in the course of time it will be fitting to censor ali the copies of the Hebrew books as was done with previous books. A further request letter sent by the community after not receiving ali the books again mentions the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq": Consequently, the community does not cease to approach His Most Gra cious Eminence, to be so good as to permit examination of the real truth and to determine especially the quality of those books which the above-men tioned Signor Costanzi has refrained from returning to the writers of this re quest. The list of the said books must be obtained from him after their pu rification according to the instructions of "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", and that he shall return them to us according to the previous régulations, either by the usuai arrangement, or if this should be necessary, with the addition of fresh emendations.14 And also in the words of guidance of Giovanni Antonio Costanzi, the inspector of Hebrew books for the Supreme Inquisition in Rome in the middle of the eighteenth century, regarding the attitude to rab binical works, the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" is mentioned: And if the Jews err therefore in thinking that ali the rabbinical books can be permitted without réservation, and just as some of the Catholics err in thinking that ali the books without exception are prohibited to the Jews, and they are incorrigible even with proofreading, examination ali of the books will represent a danger for the Catholic Church; absolute prohibition - will bring the Jews to heresy. Although it cannot be denied that in some places it is impossible to proof read Hebrew books because there is there no one suf fìciendy knowledgeable in the style of the rabbinical books, in their language and their use of abbreviations. To this end, a special toork has been prepared, which will act as a guide for the proofreading of these books, called "Sefer Ha Ziquq", in which are listed 450 rabbinical works, and next to each book are recorded those paragraphs which must be erased completely and those where altérations only are required. General instructions in the preface to this work also indicate the way in which to deal with books which are not listed espe cially in this composition.15 14 Ivi, p. 32. " Ivi, pp. 64-65.

Proof of this he found in two copies, o£ "Moreh Nevuchim" (Guide to the Perplexed) and of the "Sefer Ha-Ikarim" (Book of Prin cipies), which were censored by the censorship committee in Mantua in accordance with the instructions in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq".16 A. Raz is of the opinion that the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" was widely known, even though not printed, and served many censors. The work left its mark on the Inquisition's actions with regard to Hebrew literature.17 As far as is known the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" did not receive the offi ciai sanction of the Church, and therefore we came across books con taining the signatures of several censors in the same copy, and in other cases sections from one copy of a book have been erased, while the same sections were approved in another copy of the same work.18 In order to answer the research questions, a statistical analysis of the use of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" in the day-to-day work of the censors was carried out, and the emendations in the censored books men tioned in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq"were examined. The statistical analysis was conducted according to a study of the copies of censored books preserved in library collections in Israel and throughout the world.19 Of the 426 works listed in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" there are those of which no censored copy is to be found, and there are others of which several censored copies were found. Out of 1,082 books that were ex amined, 339 censored copies were found; 300 of them, comprising 189 cristiana religione contro le vane lusinghe de moderni Ebrei».

Popper, The Censorship ofHebrew Books cit., pp. 85-86. Popper wrote a comprehen sive monograph on the subject of censorship, but he didn't have the information which is avail able to us today, such as the manuscripts of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". According to him, the infor mation he had at his disposai about the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" was restricted to what had been pub lished in the article by M. Mort ara, Die Censur hebraischer Bucher in Italien cit., pp. 72-77, 96 101. Therefore, the only comparisons he could have made were based on the isolated passages from the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" published by Mortara. Popper himself says in his book, on p. 87: «Unfortunately, further comparisons of this kind are now impossible». And he was referring to comparisons between books bearing the signature of the censorship of Domenico and the text of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". But today we can continue to delve deeply and research the subject. 17 A. Raz-Krakotzkin, Censorship as a Regrettable Factor cit., p. 103. 18 Examples of this phenomenon were noted by G. Sacerdote, Deux index expurgatoires cit., p. 279; N. Porges, Censorship of Hebrew Books cit., p. 646. And many more examples were found in our research. 19 The books were examined in the following libraries: The National and University Li brary in Jerusalem, the Bar-Ilan University Library, and the "Ohel Baruch" collection in the library of Yeshiva University in New York.</page><page sequence="11">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 13 titles - about 44 percent of the works listed in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" - were included in the sample of the copies.20 In order to examine the extent of the use of "Sefer Haziquq" in the work of the censors, we systematically compared the copies of the censored books listed in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" page by page, with the censorship requirements in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". With regard to each book we noted which pas sages were emended or erased in accordance with the instructions of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", and also if uncalled for emendations were made. The 189 tides represent the totality of the subjects reflected in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" (Table 1).

This finding is in keeping with the energetic activity of Domenico in the framework of the censorship committee in Mantua. Books printed in from Spain and Portugal, Poland, Russia and Germany, represent about one percent of the censored works that were examined in the sample, as against 7 percent in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" itself. These data, together with the data of the books which appear in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" can add to our knowledge regarding the distribution of the books in that period. Most of the books which were in the possession of Italian Jews were locai books, the import of books from Orientai Jewish communities was relatively limited,21 and even more limited was the import from other places. On the basis of the examination of 300 of the censored books, we can divide the books into two groups: 1. Copies of books in which there are emendations without the sig nature of the censor - in 31 books, that is, 10 percent of them, the book was censored, there are clear marks of erasure and emendation, but there is no visible censor's signature at the end.22 2. Copies of books with the signature of the censor - in the other 269 books there appear one or more signatures with the following dis tribution: in 131 books there is one signature (43%); in 89, two signa tures (30%); in 36, three signatures (12%); in 11, four signatures (4%), and in two books there are fìve signatures (1%). A part of the joint signatures are the signatures of the censorship committee of Mantua which sometimes appointed two or three cen sors. However, a large part of the signatures were given with a big dif férence of years between them. Henee, even books which were ap proved by an officiai censor did not gain the récognition of the au thorities. Possibly, the reason for this was the fear that the Jews "cor rected" their books after the censorship; another possibility is that the Church did not officially recognize the work of the censors. 21 The imported printed books contained in the private libraries of the Jews of Mantua comprised only 4.9 percent of ali the books.

The main part of the activity was in the last decade of the sixteenth century and the first two decades of the seventeenth century, which were the years of Domenico Yerushalmi's activity.24 Table 2: The distribution of the signatures in the censored copies according to year (10 years) Distribution of years of signature by decades Actual years of signature in the censored copies 1550-1559 1559 1560-1569 1570-1579 1574-1575 1580-1589 1589 1590-1599 1590, 1594, 1596, 1597, 1598, 1599 1600-1609 1600, 1601, 1602, 1607, 1608, 1609 1610-1619 1610, 1611, 1612, 1613, 1615, 1616, 1617, 1618 1620-1629 1621, 1622, 1623, 1624, 1626, 1627, 1628, 1629 1630-1639 1640-1649 1640, 1641 1650-1659 1660-1669 1664 1670-1679 1680-1689 1687, 1688 In the examination of the censored copies we compared the actual emendations in the censored copies with what was required for these Actual years of signature in the censored copies 1559 1574-1575 1589 1590, 1594, 1596, 1597, 1598, 1599 1600, 1601, 1602, 1607, 1608, 1609 1610, 1611, 1612, 1613, 1615, 1616, 1617, 1618 1621, 1622, 1623, 1624, 1626, 1627, 1628, 1629 1640, 1641 1664 1£0"7 1£QO 23 Out of the 471 censorship signatures in the censored copies, about 20 percent of them appear without noting the year of signature. 24 The earliest signature which we found were two signatures of the censor Alexander Carii, dated 1559.

A statistical examination of the agree ment between the number of emendations demanded and the number of emendations actually done in the books. The censored books were examined page after page, and ali the places where there was agree ment between the emendation or erasure to that demanded in the book were listed; also listed were the uncalled for erasures and emen dations done in the book. In this examination it was found that in 154 books, that is to say in 50 percent of the books, no actual emendation was performed and the only evidence of the censorship act was the signature or signatures at the end of the book. Only in 42 books of the said 154 (27 percent) was there no demand for emendation in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". The researchers took note of this phenomenon. Gustavo Sacerdote argues that the Jews bribed the censors not to harm their books, and therefore nothing was emended or erased in these books. Carlo Bor romeo - a sixteenth-century apostate, who was a copyist in the Vati can Library, wrote that the censors were lax in emending the Hebrew books due to carelessness, indifférence, lack of knowledge and money they received from the Jews.25 Sacerdote's argument can be borne out by a number of sources. In about the year 1554 Giacomo Geraldino was accused of showing favor to the Talmud and was seen in the com pany of the Jews and conniving with them to save their books, and in order to cover up the conspiracy they were joined by the apostate An drea del Monte.26 In September 1556 Pope Paul IV terminated the work of Geraldino as censor, claiming that the Jews had bribed him.27 In a report of the Inquisition in the seventeenth century in Rome we also find accusations against Geraldino of not doing his work properly and being bribed by the Jews. Therefore the Inquisitional tribunal de manded that the books he had censored be re-examined, and that this time the work would be carried out by a wise believer with knowledge of the Christian faith28 Meir Benayahu is of a similar opinion. In his view, it is doubtful whether the censors studied the books thoroughly 25 G. Sacerdote, Deux index expurgatoire cit., p. 258. 26 M.

Actually, the books for which the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" itself required many emendations-liturgy, Midrash and Aggada, and Kabbala, here appear at the bottom of the list. (Apart from Midrash and Aggada which appear in the middle). This can be explained by the fact that the less emendations required, the easier it was to emend.

It should be pointed out that the erasures and emendations gener ally included words or isolated sentences, and only rarely were whole passages erased as the "Sefer Haziquq" demanded. The erasure of an entire page or its detaching were very rare. As a rule specific keywords or terms are emended, such as: idolatry, nation, Edom, the evil king dom - words which are mentioned repeatedly in the "Sefer Ha Ziquq". It must be understood that the censorship work was hard and exhausting, the examination of thousands of books and the search for isolated words in crowded pages filled with text necessitated a great deal of time. Therefore, it is possible to explain the small percentage of agreement also by technical reasons, such as a large amount of painstaking work and lack of time for examining each book properly. A direct link between the number of signatures and the actual number of emendations performed might be expected, namely that the more censors there were the more emendations there would be. And in fact there is a large degree of agreement of the emendations with the requirements of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" when there were one or two signatories, and particularly when there were three. However, sur prisingly, there is noticeable trend of réduction in such agreement in books where there are four or five signatures. Possibly this is related to the small number of books with four and five signatures available to us, but it is also possible that the censors who saw the signatures in them did not bother to check the books again and only added their signature at the end. In order to examine the work of the censors and the degree of agreement with what was required, not only the emendations meeting the requirement of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" were examined but also whether other things were emended which were not required there. It was found that the number of emendations not required in the book, and which were performed nevertheless is not great. These emenda tions were made apparently on the strength of the individual knowl edge of the censors, who were, as stated, apostates. Of the 300 books in the sample, in 180 books no emendations were found which were not referred to in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" (This number includes the 154 books in which no emendations at ail were made). In 68 books there were found between one and four emendations not referred to in it; in 29 books were found between five and ten emendations not referred to; and over ten emendations we found in only the following few books. Among the books for which emendations were not re</page><page sequence="17">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 19 quired there were only two which contained emendations. In one book, one emendation, and in the second book, two emendations.30 Parallel to the examinations in ali of the censored books we also tried to assess the nature of the work of spécifié censors, and especial ly to trace the work of Domenico Yerushalmi, the author of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". In an examination of the censored copies there were found the signatures of 22 différent censors. The censor with the most signatures is Domenico Yerushalmi. We compared the work of the various censors, the degree of emendations made in the copies and their agreement with the requirements of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". The examination was carried out in books hearing the signature of one censor only, representing a more accurate indication of the work of a specific censor.31 In this comparison were also included two groups of books in addition to the group with one censor's signature only: books hearing the signature of the censorship committee of Man tua and containing two or three signatures of members of the commit tee, and the group of censored books without any signature at ali. Si multaneously, a comparative examination was conducted of ali the sig natures of a specific censor in ali the books hearing his signature. As can be seen in Table 4, each censor has a différent number of censored books, and therefore it is difficult to compare them, howev er, also from the above data one may gain an impression of the work of the différent censors. At the top of the list is Petrus de Trevio, of whom only two books censored by him were found, but they agree to a great degree with what is required in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". This fact accords well with what was written in the letter of request of the Jewish community in Rome: «Afterwards His Eminence Father Ridolfi, the court minister in the Holy Palace, appointed the very exalted Fa ther de Trevi, the preacher to the Jews in Rome - to the work of cen sorship, namely, to examine the books of the Jews, compare them with the aforesaid "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" and sign them».32 The second place in the Table is occupied by Hippolitus Ferrarensis Purgavit of whom on ly two books censored by him were found. Hippolitus is also associat ed with the composition of a censorship index.33 30 For the full data see, G. Prebor, "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" cit., pp. 107-109. 31 The group of books containing the signature of one censor only contained 131 books. 14 of the 131 signatures were unidentified and therefore the next table refers to 117 signa tures only. 32 A.

We chose to include them in the sample, since the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" was based on censorship traditions which preceded it. And we were also interested in examining how the books preceding it were expurgated.</page><page sequence="19">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 21 which includes the work of two and sometimes of the three censors, was done apparently with greater thoroughness and with the aid of a copy of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", and therefore the percentage of the agreement is relatively high.37 The phenomenon of censored books without a signature at the end is interesting, and might possibly be related to the phenomenon which I. Sonne noted, that of Jewish censors who censored their books in or der to protect them but didn't sign with their name.38 This group consti tutes 10 percent of the censored books; this is a significant group, and the agreement in it is at a rate of only 35 percent. Domenico Yerushal mi appears only in sixth place in the list, with an agreement of only 32 percent. It is puzzling that that he, the author of the book which détails the requirements of censorship, does not actually carry out what is de manded of him. His signature is included, obviously, also in the 14 sig natures of the censorship committee of Mantua. Apparendy, the censor ship of the committee, which had a number of members, was more thorough, whereas in his work as a Ione censor he was less stringent. A detailed analysis of his work will be performed hereinafter. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the "Sefer Ha Ziquq" served as a practical manual in the everyday work of the cen sors, and despite this it was not greatly in use. In about fifty percent of the censored books examined, in actual fact no emendation at ali was done and the only evidence of censorship activity is the signature or signatures at the end of the book. Agreement of only 33.18 percent was found in the censored books between what was required in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" and what was done in practice. There is an inverse relationship between the number of emendations required in the "Se fer Ha-Ziquq" and the degree of agreement. It is precisely in the books in which many emendations were required that the level of agreement is low. The erasures and the emendations generally com prised words or isolated sentences, and only rarely were complete pas sages erased as the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" required. There were a number of reasons for this: Only a limited number of censors had access to the book; since the book was not printed, it may be assumed that most of the censors did not have a copy available for their use in their everyday work. The limited number of censors who 37 Lorenzo Franguello's signature appears only in two books out of the 14. According to the research findings it may be concluded that the main part of the work of the censorship committee was done in practice by Domenico Yerushalmi and Alessandro Scipione. 38 I. Sonne, Expurgation of Hebrew Books, «Bulletin of the New York Public Library», XL VI, 1942, pp. 975-1015.</page><page sequence="20">22 SHIFRA BARUCHSON -ARBIB AND GILA PREBOR did have access to the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" at a certain period did use it in their work. The censorship committee of Mantua did apparently use some version of the book in its work. At a later period it was also ap parently used by the censors: Renato de Modena who added to and updated the book, and Petrus de Trevio. A rather surprising fact, which the researchers have already noted, is that the author and com pléter of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", Domenico Yerushalemi, did not use it very much in his censorship work. There can be various reasons for this. As he himself asserted, Domenico censored over 20,000 books, and most of his work was done within a limited range of years. The work of censorship, as may be gauged from keeping track of the work of the censors, was very exhausting and complex, involving the exami nation of thousands of pages, and the search for isolated words, sen tences and passages was a very long and technically arduous process, and apparendy the censors were unable to keep up with the rate of work demanded of them individually according to the instructions of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". Another reason was apparendy the pressure that the Jews exerted on the censors through a special payment or some other form of persuasion. Against the background of these findings we can perhaps better understand the rejoicing of the Jews of Italy who saw in the decree of censorship an achievement. The censorship of the Hebrew books was the fruit of the lobbying of the Pope by the Jews, who sought to find an alternative to the decree of confiscation and destruction of ali the books they possessed. The rejoicing among the communities was so great that the Jewish communal leaders of Rome, in a letter they wrote regarding the acceptance of the new decree, noted that «there were no better days for Israel than that day... Because this day is a day of good tidings to satisfy the soul's yearning».39 B. Internai censorship - the influence of "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" on the print ing of Hebrew books The prior internai censorship of Hebrew Books was done on the initiative of the Jewish community, and it deleted words, expressions and matters which could be interpreted as being opposed to Chris tians and Christianity. Its aim was to prevent as far as possible the ex terna! censorship of books, their confiscation and their destruction and 39 See Z. Schwartz, Letters regarding the dlecree against the books in the year 1554, «Alim», II, 1932, p. 52 (heb).</page><page sequence="21">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 23 burning It was a more wide-ranging and thorough censorship than the external censorship, and it is far harder to discover and reveal its tracks. Prior internai censorship of this nature existed from the begin ning of printing, even in the period when there was no Church censor ship. The printers chose to exercise it because of fear of the Church, lest the sale of their books in the Papal State be adversely affected. Meir Benayahu dealt with this issue in his book "Copyright, Au thorizarion and Imprimatur for Hebrew Books Printed in Venice", and gives examples of textual altérations and deletions already at the beginning of era of printing, even before the decree of censorship came into effect.40 The Church's supervision intensified in the second half of the six teenth century and became more systematic. The results are clearly visi ble in the texts of the prayers in the daily and festival prayer books, and especially in the order of the penitential prayers (Selichot) in the Ashke nazi rite, in which there are many expressions condemning the nations and the Christian faith. Benayahu gives examples of deletions and emendations in the prayer text, and observes that «the development of the changes of the text is extremely important. The researchers paid at tention to the complete and exact versions in the manuscripts and did not dwell upon their development in the printed books which our fore fathers possessed and from which they recited in their prayers. There are many prayers and penitential prayers whose primary form is un known to us, and even when the Church's hands were not burdensome they kept to the distorted version».41 There are further examples of in ternai censorship in Venetian printed books. For about ten years be tween 1554-1563 no books were printed there; when they resumed printing the Venetian printers were careful not to include prohibited items. Therefore it is possible to find censorship omissions and blank spaces which were left. Some of the omissions resulted in many things being left without context and meaning, and these distortions of the censor were printed henceforth in ali the printed works until today.42 In his article, A. Freimann enumerated books in which the printers had been compelled to change several pages, thus creating différent 40 M. Benayahu, Haskama Vereshut in the Printed Books of Vertice cit., pp. 158-164. 41 Ivi, pp. 155-212. Although Benayahu is referring to the text of the prayers, this also holds true for other subjects. An example of this can be seen in the book "Tzror Hamor" which will be discusseci further on in the chapter, and where censored passages are missing from éditions which appeared in Bnei Brak in the years 1985 and 1990, éditions which were based on manuscripts lacking their beginning, and because they did not study the earliest printed versions they did not make good what was missing. 42 M. Benayahu, Haskama Vereshut in the Printed Books ofVenice cit., p. 203.</page><page sequence="22">24 SHIFRA BARUCHSON-ARBIB AND GILA PREBOR éditions.43 Zunz also dealt with the subject, and noted changes of text created as a result of the censorship, particularly in festival prayer books (Machzorim).44 One of the scholars who dealt with this subject at length is Sonne who insisted on the great importance of the internai censorship. In his opinion this was a thorough censorship, which left indelible traces in Hebrew literature. The censorship of individuai printed volumes was performed in part under the supervision of apostates sporadically, not continuously, and as a result of this it lacks method. Totally différent was the internai censorship prior to the printing of new éditions The publishers had to take into considération the requirements of their cus tomers and their wishes. The latter were not prepared to purchase books over which there hovered the threat of confiscation by the Inqui sition or those which had been arbitrarily altered or disfigured. And they employed famous scholars and rabbis for this work.45 From Baruchson's research on the reading patterns of the Jews of Italy to wards the end of the Renaissance, it emerges that the main part of the influence of the Church's policy can be seen in the destruction of the Talmud which is the basis for the study of Jewish law, as a result of which there was an increase in the distribution of the books of Halacha and the Posekim, which served as a substitute for the Talmud. In Baruchson's opinion, other Hebrew books were less significantly affected.46 Bonfil believes that the libraries of Italian Jews in the period be tween the sixteenth century and the middle of the seventeenth century contained less anti-Christian content and more contents not offensive to the Christian faith. This fact also necessarily influenced the new works of the Jews.47 An example of this is Isaac Abarbanel's book "Mifalot Elohim" in which, as a result of censorship, whole paragraphs were changed for others which were in line with Christian dogma.48 Joseph Haker found evidence regarding the nature of the internai censorship which the Italian printers and scholars took upon them 43 Aron Freimann, Uber Schicksale hebraischer Bucher, «ZFUB», X, 1906, pp. 173-175. 44 Léonard Zunz, Die Ritus des Synagogalen Gottesdienstes, Berlin, Julius Springer, 1859, pp. 224-255.

Most researchers present the censorship of the Hebrew literature as part of the oppressive mea sures enacted by the Catholic Church against the Jews, and as a limit ing factor, restrictive and an obstacle to the cultural development of the Jews. In Raz's view, the erasures in the censored texts did not ad versely affect them, but created fresh possibilities for reading which enabled both the Jews and Christian scholars to read them. The rea son for the need of the Church to intervene in Hebrew literature is the great interest which the Christian scholars displayed in it. In his opinion it is difficult to find many readings which were lost as a result of the censorship activity.50 Other researchers and bibliographers also noted the différences be tween the différent éditions, and over the years a number of articles were written dealing with this issue and even with specific books:31 however, until now no comprehensive research has been written on the subject, tracing the évolution of the text in différent printed édi tions. It is possible that the printed édition of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" will facilitate a more far-reaching and in-depth study of this subject. As mentioned above, the phenomenon of prior internai censorship in Hebrew books preceded the institutionalized Church censorship, and for certain preceded the writing of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". In the book itself this phenomenon is mentioned a number of times. For ex ample in book No. 306, "Sefer Habechayai", "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" refers 49 Y.

In cases where there are two éditions of the same book, both of which were printed in the period before the writing of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", but one of them underwent internai censorship be fore its printing and the second did not, the book refers to this by noting the emendations required in the uncensored édition.53 In this paper we have tried to examine the subsequent impact of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" on the printing of Hebrew books in Italy. Ex amination of the influence of the book on the printing of Hebrew books is complex and difficult for a number of reasons: the first rea son is that the considérations of the printers of new éditions are com plex, and it is hard to isolate the component of censorship as a factor in the printing or non-printing of a given work. Literary interest is a corollary of many factors: cultural traditions, religious requirements, methods of learning, subjective motivations, and so forth. The com mercial side of the book trade is dépendent on a number of factors, like the publisher, the printer, and the bookseller. Church supervision and censorship were only one factor in the context of a range of fac tors which influenced the printing and distribution of the books.54 The second reason is that the Hebrew press in Italy in the seventeenth cen tury was in decline from its previous greatness. In the sixteenth centu ry the largest quantity of Hebrew books was printed in Venice, but in the seventeenth century there was a marked decrease in the number of books printed in Italy overall and in Venice in particular. The reasons 52 For further examples see G. Pkebor, "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" cit., pp. 122-123. 53 One can see examples of this in the éditions mentioned in the "Sefer Ha-Zikquq" re garding: "Sefer Tzror Hamor", "Sefer Ha-Kuzari" and "Sefer Sheelot U'Teshuvot Haran". See ivi, pp. 123-126. 54 S. Baruchson, Books and Readers cit., p. 18.</page><page sequence="25">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 27 for this decrease are not connected with Church supervision alone but are related to politicai and social factors which contributed to the de cline of Venice as a center of commerce and the rise of a new center of printing in the city of commerce, Amsterdam. During the seven teenth century Amsterdam became the center of Hebrew printing and cast a shadow over the centers of Hebrew printing.55 The third reason is essentially technical, and it is that keeping track of the texts in dif férent printings is very complicated, because the différent printings were also printed with différent pagination, and it is very difficult to keep track of the written text. Comparison of the variations of the text in the différent éditions of a given work which was published in a number of printings, or of a printed édition as against the manuscripts of the work, constitutes a comprehensive research in itself, and there is no possibility in the context of this paper to discuss the whole of the Hebrew literature mentioned in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". Nevertheless, we decided not to ignore this topic, and we carried out a sample to examine books mentioned in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq and which were reprinted in Italy in the seventeenth century. Of the 426 books listed in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" we examined those that were reprinted in Italy in the seventeenth century.56 The ex amination showed that in about a quarter of the books mentioned in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq", that is 128 books, the édition which the book refers to is the only one which was printed and no further éditions of it were printed. Among the remaining books it was found that only 40 books, about 10 percent of ali the books mentioned in the "Sefer Ha Ziquq", were reprinted in Italy in the seventeenth century.57 The 40 books represent the whole gamut of subjects present in the "Sefer Ha Ziquq", but no connection was found between the number of emen 55 On the Hebrew printing in Italy in the seventeenth century see: David W.

On the contrary, for example, almost ali the liturgical literature was reprinted, despite the fact that in this literary genre far greater censorship was required. Af ter ali, it could have been possible not to print this literature because of the great bother and the danger that it would be disqualified, but since this was an important and sought-after genre, without which there was no Jewish life, the décision to print it was not influenced by the censorship. From the list of these 40 books, 15 were examined, copies of which are in the National and University Library in Jerusalem, and which represent the broad range of différent subjects.58 14 books were examined in a sampling examination which included examination in at least 20 percent of the places which required emendation in the book under discussion. The 20 percent were chosen at random from the be ginning, middle and end of the book. A comparison was made be tween the édition which the Sefer Ha-Ziquq refers to and the new printed édition, and it was checked to see if the éditions were "emended" in their reprinting. One of the books, "Sefer Ha-Ikarim", was chosen as a "case study" and subjected to a thorough examination which included comparison of ali the places in which emendation was required in ali the éditions printed after the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". In the context of this paper we have chosen to give the findings of the com parative examination together with a number of examples.59 In an analysis of the findings of the comparison between the différent édi tions it was found that of the 15 books examined60 only in two books, "Sefer Ha-Kritut" and "Sefer Ha-Midrash Shmuel shel Pirkei Avot" was no différence found between the éditions referred to in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" and the édition that was reprinted in Italy in the seven teenth century. In these two books only very few emendations were required.61 In the other 13 books examined, in which from 5 to 72 emendations 58 In the sample examination the liturgical books were not included. The censorship in the prayer books and Machzors is a broad subject deserving of a separate research, and we were unable to deal with it in the context of this research. 59 The full findings are detailed in the research: G. Prebor, "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" cit., pp. 131-166. 60 And they are: Sefer Ha-Ikarim, Sefer Kritot, Menorat Ha'Maor, Mishnayot with Ram bam Commentary and Rabeinu Ovadia, Sefer Sheelot Ve-Teshuvot of Rabeinu Asher, Yalkut Shimoni on the Torah, Yalkut on the Prophets, Torat Moshe, Midrash Shemuel shel Pirkei Avot, Mishne Torah, Pirkei Rabi Elazar, Iggeret Ha'Rambam, Ayin Israel, Seder Ha'Yom, Torah Or. 61 Three in the "Sefer Kritot" and two in the "Sefer Midrash Shmuel shel Pirkei Avot".</page><page sequence="27">29 SEFERSEFERSEFER HA-ZIQUQHA-ZIQUQ werwere required, changes were found in the sample examination which were made in the new editions which were printed.

Despite the fact that the in structions of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" require in many instances the era sure of a passage containing a sentence or a number of sentences, and sometimes even a full chapter, few deletions of this kind were found. The biggest deletion was found in "Sefer Ha-Ikarim" in which the deletion of an entire chapter was required - Chapter 25 in section 3 And indeed, in the censored editions, although the entire chapter was not erased, long and very significant parts of it were. Only six of the 24 emendations required in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" referring to the "Se fer Ha-Ikarim" were unchanged. Most of the changes which were made in the censored printings include changes of single words and expressions and sometimes their deletion. The words and expressions which were altered recur again and again in the various books: instead of "avoda zara" was written "avodat elilim"; the words "avodat elil im", "akum" (idolators), kutim (Gentiles) replace the words "goy/ 'im"; "meshumad" (apostate) is replaced by "mumar"; "Romi/iim" by "Aram" or "umot haoloam". "mausa hi haorla" was changed to the past tense, "mausa hayeta haorla". The emendations required in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" fall into three categories: 1. Emendations of topics interpreted as being opposed to Christianity or in mockery of Christianity. 2. Passages in which there is praise of the People of Israel and the Jewish religión and they can be again interpreted as condemnation of Christianity and evidence of the supremacy of the Jews over the Christians. 3. Forbidden ideas regard</page><page sequence="29">SEFER HA-ZIQUQ 31 ed as heresy, such as passages dealing with the anthropomorphism of the Creator, reincarnation and résurrection of the dead. In a comparison carried out between the changes that were made in the above expurgation contents, we noted that most of the changes are connected with censorship content from category 1, namely era sure of words and expressions interpreted as opposed to Christianity or in mockery of Christianity. It may be assumed that the reason for this is that it was easier to emend the most visible "problematic" ex pressions than to refer to the reqired emendations to catégories 2 and 3, where it was necessary to study the text closely in order to discover the "problematic nature". These words and expressions are also those which were generally erased by the censors in their work. Based on these findings it transpires that the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" did not influence considérations of printing or non-printing of the éditions of the books, since, as we have said, no connection was found between the number of emendations required and the printing of the books. Moreover, it was actually the liturgical literature, about which the cen sorship demands were severe, which was reprinted many times. How ever, the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" and the censorship requirements influ enced the internai content of books in Italy in the seventeenth century, and changes demanded in the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq" were introduced in part in these éditions. There is room for examining the changes car ried out in the Hebrew literature as a result of the demands of the censors, and it is hoped that this topic will be examined in further re search carried out following the publication of the "Sefer Ha-Ziquq". RIASSUNTO Nell'ambito della condanna dei libri proibiti, promossa dalla Chiesa cat tolica ai tempi della Controriforma, l'indice più importante relativo ai libri ebraici è il Sefer Ha-Ziquq di Domenico Gerosolimitano scritto in Italia nella seconda metà del Cinquecento: è il più ricco di titoli citati ma anche il più ampio per dimensione cronologica. Intento dell'articolo è quello di esaminare l'estensione e l'influenza esercitata dal Sefer Ha-Ziquq e l'impatto sulla censu ra, esterna ed interna, della letteratura ebraica. Gli interrogativi centrali cui gli Autori vogliono rispondere sono: in che misura Sefer Ha-Ziquq fu usato nell'attività di censura esterna? quale fu l'impatto di questo libro sulla stam pa di libri ebraici e nel modellare la cultura del leggere? Quali furono le ca ratteristiche dell'autocensura dei testi e se gli stampatori si astennero dallo stampare certi testi.</page></plain_text>
