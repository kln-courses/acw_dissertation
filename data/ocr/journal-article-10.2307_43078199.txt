<plain_text><page sequence="1">24 How Representations of Battles of the Gods Developed E. Douglas Van Buren - Rome Representations in glyptic art of gods fighting among themselves were a subject which aroused the interest of the earliest scholars of Near Eastern art who interpreted the scenes as depicting human sacrifices. Heuzey strongly opposed that theory (*), and saw in such a seal as A 141 a picture of the Sun-god accompanied by Gibil, the god of fire (2). Frankfort (3), rightly perceiving that it was not suffi- cient to explain a single example, proposed to see in the whole series representations of the contests between the older and the younger gods alluded to in the Epic of Creation, culminating in the defeat and death at Marduk's hands of Kingu, leader of the hosts oí Tiamat. At Babylon this tragic event was reproduced in mime as part of a ritual drama enacted at the New Year Festival. M. Pierre Amiet, the latest investigator of the problem (4), makes many helpful observations in an attempt to account for the origin and structure of these scenes. He accepts Frankfort's theory in principle, but sub- stitutes for Marduk as the principal protagonist Gibil, the Fire-god, " incendiary of the reed-beds ", destroyer of vegetation in the heat of summer, who was identified with Nergal (6). This theory would compel us to conclude that the figure with rays or flames of fire was a destructive force who must be opposed and destroyed. The rep- resentations, on the contrary, depict him as always victorious, and every ignominy is heaped upon his opponent. The examples in the series are numerous, and however diligently they may be sought some of them must inevitably escape notice. (x) Heuzey, Les Origines orientales de l'art , p. 359.

Therefore without attempting to settle the vexed question of what myths were illustrated and who exactly the protagonists may have been, a survey of as many specimens as possible may help to bring into prominence certain im- portant features, to suggest why the figures are grouped or combined in a particular manner, and to define the factors which influenced the structure and style of the compositions. In the Akkadian period the subject was frequently treated, and a survey of the material as a whole reveals the fact that the craftsmen did not copy or adapt a single model, but depicted various episodes with individual variations. Amiet very rightly observes that the figures in these scenes are arranged as a frieze composed in imitation of the friezes of struggling anthropomorphic and theriomorphic forms characteristic of the Second Early Dynastic period. As proof of such a derivation he points out that in these representations groups of heroes contending with bulls or lions were occasionally incorporated into scenes of fighting gods (*). This infiltration is not found, however, among what seem to be the earliest embodiments of the motive, and when it does occur the groups are not a reversion to type, for they are not treated in the distinctive Second Early Dynastic style, but in the style characteristic of the fully developed Akkadian period. How- ever arbitrary the few infiltrations of animals between the figures may appear to be it must have been with some special significance that a particular animal was inserted (2).

Douglas Van Buren ments are rare; the use of vegetable motives as terminals or filling motives is extremely restricted (*). It is usually implied in discussions of these scenes that they pictured the drama enacted during the ceremonies of the New Year Festival. But these Akkadian works of art do not appear to represent a staged conflict. Their object was not to depict a spectacle, but to record what was supposed to have actually happened. For that reason in what seem to have been the earliest examples the composi- tion is limited strictly to the figures of the combatants who are por- trayed on an absolute equality, all alike nude, or at best with the most meagre loin-cloths, and all alike armed with the same kind of primitive weapons. Amiet refers to a lack of respect amounting to cynicism with which the divine antagonists are sometimes treated (2). That judgment is mainly based on a single example (3). If all the series are considered it will be noted that, far from attempting to introduce a comic element, there is an earnest desire to convey the full seriousness of the events which were believed to have occurred. The scenes are represented with an uncompromising realism, and it is the defeated foes only whose bodies fall in the grotesque, but natural attitudes of violent death. In scenes where the victim is immolated on the pyre there is something pitiful in the utter helplessness of his figure, thus stressing the tragedy. It is difficult to ascertain when the motive originated. One of its forerunners may have been an only partly preserved seal impression discovered at Ur in Pit W, attributed to SIS 4-5 (4). What remains of the design represents a hero or divinity grasping the wrist of the hand in which his opponent holds a dagger, and at the same time seizing his enemy's top-knot of long hair. Both antagonists are clad in a short garment ending above the knee, but over it the divinity wears a long skirt opening in front, a type of garment often worn by the victor in the later Akkadian series.

As almost all these seals are of unknown provenance or come from unstratified finds it is only by presumptive evidence that they can be approximately dated. What seem to be the earliest examples are scenes in which small figures schematically rendered are arranged in a series of pairs of antagonists engaged in individual conflicts (^. Perhaps the earliest of the series is a somewhat rubbed seal of dark green jasper (Fig. 1) (2). It represents nude fighting figures who seem to be divinities because traces of horns above their heads are still visible. There are no extraneous elements in the field. The first pair attack one another with their weapons; the second pair are confronted but have not yet come to blows; beyond them is a fantastic being whose human torso merges into two leonine bodies. With each hand extended laterally this being grasps a serpent which seems to rise vertically from the root of the leonine tail. Similar fantastic beings were characteristic of the Second Early Dynastic period, but were almost unknown in later ages. Only one other example belonging to the Akkadian period can be cited, and it is rendered in the fully developed Akkadian style (3). Details, such as the tails which turn into serpents, demonstrate that both examples derive, with modifi- cations successively increased, from an Early Dynastic prototype in which the fantastic elements are forcibly emphasized (4). Evidently the monster played an important part in one version of the legend. Two seals belonging to the earliest examples are alike in that between the pairs of fighting figures a nude attendant stands holding what is described as a rope to bind the prisoners, or a gate-post from which trails the rope used to fasten the door (Fig. 2) (5). An attendant on another seal carries a big bundle on his head towards a waiting i1) Corpus I, Nos. 174, 176; Speleers, Cat. des Intailles, pp. 126-7, No. 571a; Mus. Guimet No. 28; Newell Coll.

Although it differs from the other examples in some parti- culars a somewhat damaged white marble seal belongs among the early specimens (Fig. 3) (a). These warriors have long hair hanging down their backs, conspicuous horns adorn their head-gear, and they seem to wear very short garments. Every pair of opponents is ab- sorbed in its own fierce struggle, unheeding of the little gazelle rampant with averted head between the first two groups. A rearing gazelle in exactly the same attitude is found on a fine seal showing the well- modelled figures of pairs of nude antagonists, all bearded and with long hair hanging down between their shoulder-blades and turned up at the end in a spiral curl (3). Another early example comprises two variations (4), a hero struggling with a lion, and the first of the nu- merous examples of a hero or divinity who launches his attack by seizing a bull-man by one of his horns, a gesture repeated in all sub- sequent examples (Fig. 4) (5). The representations on a few seals are akin to the series already discussed in subject, but not in style. The first shows two groups of nude antagonists whose bodies are summarily indicated, but their big heads with thick, short, cap-like hair are more carefully rendered. They show no signs, however, of being divinities (6). The anatomy of the combatants in another scene is well observed, and their actions are lively (7). Although they have no distinctive marks of divinity two of the assailants raise one long arm in the gesture often made in the other series when one divine combatant seeks to grasp the horned cap of his opponent. Another variation from the normal depicts three pairs of bearded figures with rather long hair which turns up sharply at the ends. P) VARS, No. 229. (2) CCO, A 127, p. 107, PL 70, fig. 8.

They are unarmed, and the chief sign of violence they display is that four of them endeavour to seize a horn of their opponent's headdress (*). This action can be noted in the majority of the examples, probably because to deprive an opponent of his horned cap symbolized depriving him of divinity. Works of art of the Third Early Dynastic epoch, and later monuments also, demonstrate that the usual archaic practice was to represent the victors draped, the defeated absolutely naked. In this represen- tation, however, the only nude figure seems to be that of one of the conquerors. This supposition is confirmed by the two pairs of com- batants in another scene; they all wear horned caps, but the two nude victors prepare to cut the throats of their two clothed adversaries (2). Incomparably finer is a lapis lazuli seal found at Kish in what was believed to be the grave of a woman of royal rank (3). The representation depicts all the warring foes clad alike with horned caps and long dividing skirts with vertical lines. The fierce contest is carried on by three groups, each consisting of two antagonists, but the hero of the second group, before engaging his present adversary has wounded one enemy and slain a second who lies prone beneath his feet. The evidence afforded by the various scenes seems to imply that the original " standard " method of depicting battles of the gods consisted of arranging a series of groups of two figures fighting on a basis of perfect equality, thus illustrating a generic contest in which either party might win. Gradually, however, a less impartial point of view began to prevail; the victors are clearly indicated and a growing spirit of ruthlessness or even of brutality makes itself felt. The successful warrior grasps his opponent's beard and wrenches up his head so that he may more easily cut his throat (Fig. 10) (4); (1) Delaporte, Intailles orientales au Palais des Arts de la Ville de Lyon : Mélanges syriens I, p. 909, Pl.

Very soon the need arose to illustrate some specific episode of the mythological legends. Of these, the most important was one believed to represent the defeat and death of Kingu, leader of the rebel hosts of Tiamat. According to the Epic of Creation his throat was cut, but indications in a ritual text imply that he was set on fire (2) . Akkadian seal engravers were evidently acquainted with both versions which seem to have been in use absolutely contemporaneously. Probably the seal engraver selected the version favoured in the locality inhabited by the patron for whom the seal was being made. Usually it is not as an isolated episode that the overthrow of Kingu is represented, but as an incident in the general conflict. He sits, or is forced to sit by his captor on a pile of stones which served as a pyre, but were intended to indicate the mountainous region in which the fight took place. Like the other divinities Kingu is nude, but is crowned with a horned cap, one horn of which is often grasped by his assailant (3). Sometimes pathetic details are added, as when his broken mace slips from his nerveless hand (4). In one instance the conqueror raises in his arms the feebly gesticulating body to hurl it upon the pyre, while a bird of ill-omen hovers above (Fig. 12) (6). Before long it was felt that to create an unequivocal pictorial rendering of the story the hero must be distinguished by special signs to ensure his instant recognition as a sun-god. Therefore he was henceforward usually portrayed with rays rising from his arms or other parts of his body (6). Often aided by a companion, who was (!)

A tragic scene shows Kingu immobilized upon the pyre and the sun-god with a triple torch about to kindle the fire which will consume his body (Fig. 6) (x). A more complete version shows the victor with a triple torch kindling the fire which is blown to fiercer energy by a small attendant with a blow-pipe crouching beside the pyre (Fig. 7) (2). The blow-pipe reappears in another scene where the sun-god does not seem to hold the triple torch (3). An interesting variant is depicted in the middle group of three pairs of combatants. The sun-god attacks his adversary who is still on foot, although he is already beginning to yield and his broken weapon falls from his lowered hand. The sun-god holds ready in his out-thrust hand the triple torch which is carefully delineated, but the god's arm is discernible only as a thickened line along the top of the two short columns of inscription inappropriately inserted between the figures (Fig. 8) (4). What may be a curious adaption or abbreviation of the motive is given by a small seal; of the two pairs of contending figures the vanquished opponents, although they still stand on their feet, are no longer capable of resistance, and flames spurt forth from their bodies (5). Once the sun-god stands in the unmistakable guise of Shamash, serrated blade in hand, watching a lesser god who holds the limp, outstretched body of the dead Kingu; he holds his burden awkwardly behind his own body, perhaps to avoid the tongues of fire which still leap up from the corpse (Fig. 9) (*). Twice it is not on a pile of stones that the doomed divinity is seated, but on a stepped base of two square-cut slabs of stone (7). It was not only as the pitiless slayer of the leader of the rebels that the sun-god was active. He contends with a foe on equal terms (8), or with an adversary beaten í1) CCO, A 143, pp. 109-10, PI. 71, fig. 11; Ur Excav. II, PI. 206, No. 199. (2) CCO, A 142, p. 109, PI. 71, fig. 10; Cyl.

It is obvious that versions of the ancient legends which are not related in any text which has come down to us were familiar to Ak- kadian seal engravers. One such version evidently described how the goddess Innin assisted at the slaying of Kingu. She is arrayed in a flounced robe and head-dress with four pairs of horns, and from her shoulders rise what have been described as rays, weapons, or verdure marking her as a fertility goddess (4). Sometimes a preliminary stage of the story seems to be depicted, for the enemy is not yet overcome. When he begins to totter under the assault the goddess seizes his arm to prevent him from using his mace (6) . The first of the two examples cited is preserved in a seal impression from Nippur; the second is a seal found at Ur; therefore the version illustrated must have been very well known if almost identical representations could be repro- duced in two separate cities. Once, more remotely, she stands with folded hands watching the god who attacks the foe (8). She is rep- resented clutching the shoulder of the victim on the pyre to steady his body so that the victor may the more easily cut his throat (Fig. 11) (7). Or she grabs one horn of his cap (8) ; or when the god raises Kingu's body to place it on the pile of stones, the goddess holds up the victim's foot (Fig. 12) (9). When the god with his triple torch sets fire to the vanquished, the goddess, her help no longer needed, stands apart in frontal attitude (Fig. 7) (10). In the treatment of this subject it is interesting to observe the evolution of more spiritual and less realistic ideas concerning the nat- (!) Mus. di Torino, Coll. Or.

Then she stands apart and watches the fighters. Still later an attempt is made to reconcile the legend of the bellicose Innin with other milder aspects of her nature which in the Akkadian period were more highly esteemed. The fight still rages, but away on the right Innin sits calmly, a little drinking bowl in her hand, ministered to by an attendant (x). Two late examples appear at first glance arbitrarily to combine unrelated mythological motives. The first pictures a nude divinity who has sunk to one knee and is forced backwards on to a pile of stones by his assailant who grasps a horn of his cap and kicks him in the groin. This violence contrasts with the right half of the scene which depicts the peaceful cult of a vegetation divinity. A man carrying a goat as an offering is escorted by a god preceded by another god from whose shoulders greenery rises who stands before a goddess seated, facing to left as in the previous example, on a pile of reeds; in her hand she holds sprays of verdure (2). A similar group of the defeated god appears on the second seal and is followed by a bull-man assaulted by a god (Fig. 13) (3). A serpent writhing vertically the whole height of the field divides those conflicts from a peaceful scene consisting of a god in an attitude of supplication who stands beside an altar placed before a goddess seated facing to left on the super- imposed imbrications which denote a mountain. Protruding from the base of the rocks are the head, shoulder, and arm of a being whose horned cap identifies him as a divinity. The goddess holds like a sceptre a stem which bursts at the top into bud and leaf. Two maces project from her back, last vestiges of her warlike character. Frank- fort thinks that the being protruding from beneath the feet of the goddess was the god who had been imprisoned in the mountain and here is resurgent to new life (4). Amiet proposes to see in all these scenes the vanquished brought captive in homage to the goddess (5). The best evidence for such a theory is a small seal which represents two nude figures who drive two others whose wrists are bound towards H Ball, PSBA XIV (1892), Fig. 6; B. N. No. 70; Amiet, Rev.

Douglas Van Buren a goddess seated with a drinking vessel in one hand and a verdant spray pendent from the other (Fig. 14) (*). On a similar seal from Tall Brak a man urges forward two men whose wrists are bound and whose legs also are shackled (2). Nothing, however, distinguishes either captors or captives as divinities; the former carry hoes not maces, and the latter are not indicated as prisoners of war, and con- sequently the scene may illustrate some other story. Possibly the interpretations of both Frankfort and Amiet may be true, although the nucleus of the theme seems to have been the battles of the gods. The participation of the goddess was an accretion made popular by a widely known version of the legend which was, nevertheless, incom- patible with later less realistic religious sentiments which, while not forgetting that Innin was a warrior goddess, preferred to honour her in her milder aspect as a fertility divinity. Therefore the connection with the fighting gods was minimized by representing her enthroned and aloof, separated by her worshippers from the turmoil of battle. The study of iconography reveals that the prototype of the char- acteristic figure of the warlike Ishtar, so popular in the Early Babyl- onian period, is to be found in the image of the goddess as depicted in the best worked examples of the Akkadian series (Fig. 11) (3) where she is portrayed arrayed in the apparel appropriate to the higher divinities, with the upper part of her body rendered in frontal aspect, and with weapons rising from her shoulders. Consequently it is pos- sible that to the earliest form of this once popular legend was due the original conception of Ishtar in warlike aspect. Occasionally, as in the contest witnessed so abstractedly by the seated goddess, when one adversary prepares to cut the throat of the other, a curious detail occurs. Between the antagonists stands a tiny figure with long hair and short, full skirt who is apparently female.

Finally, the dagger being now firmly in the grasp of the victor, she is shown seated quietly between the contending parties, holding in her hand an indeterminate object; the analogy of other figures seated in precisely the same attitude, combined with the shape of the object she holds, suggests that it may be a lyre (2), perhaps to accompany the chant of a paean of victory. The intro- duction of the little figure, several times repeated in every particular, evidently illustrated a secondary but well known incident narrated in the epic. Representations of the intervention of the goddess are never stereotyped, and they contain other details besides the dagger-bearer which lead on to further categories. A detail of this kind can be noted in a fine example of the goddess series, for the slaying of Kingu is there depicted in a manner which seems unique (Fig. 11) (3). His assailant has a big quiver hung on his back, an arrow from which has been aimed from the small bow he carries and it has pierced Kingu below the waist. Frankfort believes that the god is identified by the bow as Ninurta, god of war and liberator of the deity incarcerated in the mountain (4). The divine archer reappears in a scene where he aims an arrow from his bow at a bound prisoner driven towards him by another god (5). There are two variants of the scene which both stress the part played by the bowman (Fig. 16) (6). Two other examples evi- dently belong to the same category, although the victor has discarded his bow for a mace with which he menaces a prisoner whose body is so tightly bound with a rope wound round him that he has difficulty in moving (Fig. 8) (7). Moreover, in the first example the arrows previously aimed at him when he sought to flee still project from his buttocks. In this scene a bull rears near him, whereas in the first of the bound captive series a bull stands above a mountain be- (*) Legrain, Seal Cylinders (Ur Excav. X), p. 21, PI. 17, No. 244.

These scenes represent the episode of the bound captive as an isolated group in the general mêlée. An enigmatic seal illustrates a very curious version of the captive god motive (2). It represents a god with long hair hanging down his back, a four-horned head-dress, and a tasselled skirt, this last in itself an unusual detail perhaps intended to indicate the uncouth or demonic nature of the wearer, for the skirt is very strangely fashioned. His hands and feet are shackled, for they appear to be clamped in wooden frames like those used even in the present day to fetter the limbs of criminals in Thibet. On each side of him monstrous serpents rear vertically, and in front of him a man holds extended what appears to be a net. The first man is followed by a second who is completely nude and holds a great three-headed serpent. He precedes a god mounted on a dragon with an erect serpentine tail. The god holds in each hand a stem ending in three branches, which have been thought to identify him as a vegetation divinity. The object, however, bears an extraordinarily close resemblance to the triple torch with which the victor approaches the hapless Kingu (8). An abbreviated version of this scene is given on another seal, as Amiet has most acutely observed (4), where the man with the net is inserted into a procession of deities mounted on dragons (6); details are, however, too blurred to disclose their full significance. The affinity of certain details depicted in another scene with those seen in the representation of the shackled god seems to confirm the connection of the latter with the legend of contending gods. It represents a divinity standing facing to right with both hands thrust forward in the attitude of one whose wrists are bound (Fig. 17) (8); he watches a god who has sunk to one knee and seeks to defend himself by clutching at the mace of his adversary who kicks him in the groin and tugs at a horn of his head- dress.

It is likely that this restricted group of compositions illustrated a different version of the legend according to which the vanquished was not slain, but was bound and carried away captive. The last example of the former series shows a sequence of three groups. The first represents the group of the bound captive. The second, to which reference has already been made (Fig. 8) (x), pictures the god with a triple torch and his opponent. Lastly, on the left there is a group of a nude divinity reversing his foe by holding him up by one foot. A second god helps the first to hold up the van- quished in another scene composed of two groups, each of three figures; two lions rampant and crossed separate the larger groups (Fig. 18) (2). The group on the left consists of two figures who have captured a fantastic being, half bird and half man, an episode borrowed from the Legend of Zû which was, in essence, another part of the story of war in heaven. It links with the series another scene in which a god seems to incite one big and one small lion-headed eagle to attack a divine adversary who has fallen on one knee in his endeavour to defend himself (Fig. 19) (3). The defeated is pictured in still another scene in the same attitude of helplessness, for he is attacked on both sides by two strangely attired divinities apparently assisted by a bird of prey (4). The series ends with the divine bird-monster trium- phant, standing upon one prostrate man, and clutching with his talons the heads of two others. He surveys the scene of the dead Kingu being borne to the feet of Shamash as previously described (Fig. 9) (•).

On the left a nude god drives his captive enemy before him, for he grips the wrist of his lowered arm tightly and makes him advance by tapping him on the head with his mace. On the right two divinities strive with an elemental being whose head, neck, and arm or leg protrude from a mountain. The god on the left prepares to strike the foe with his mace, his companion on the right sets one foot on the mountain and tugs at the creature's protrud- ing limb. My earlier attempt to associate this scene with the Legend of Zû is perhaps rightly rejected by M. Amiet who believes it illus- trates a text of victory over the enemies of the Land typified by a serpent issuing from the mountain (2). The objection to that theory is that the head of the being is not reptilian, and there is no precedent in Mesopotamian art for a serpent with arms or legs. Neither can the interpretation that it represents the god incarcerated in the mountains, offered in explanation of A 131 (Fig. 13) (3), be here appli- ed, for they are not his liberators who stand on each side, but his bitter antagonists. Certain specimens belonging to the related mytho- logical cycle of Shamash rising above the mountains show a lion or leonine monster issuing from the depths of the mountains which the Sun-god surmounts (4). The best example depicts the head and shoulders of a lion freed from the rocky mass and spewing forth flames or venom. Perhaps a fine seal discovered at Ur should be included in this category, for it represents a semi-emerged lion against a background of mountains, crouching at the feet of the rising Sha- mash (Fig. 21) (6). These examples suggest that in this case also the elemental being might be a leonine monster. Akkadian glyptic artists were fertile in invention and very soon began to introduce other figures besides the combatants into the theme of the battles of the gods, to combine that subject with other myths, or even to reduce the original primary theme to the status of a sec- ondary motive. A few times a divinity without any special identify- ing characteristics contemplates the affray from one side, the earliest (*) Iraq Mus. 12050, Basmadschi, Landschaftliche Elemente , p. 139, Pl.

An unidentified enthroned deity to whom a man brings the offering of a goat (2), and a divinity astride an animal which looks like an onager (3), both appear to be without parallels. Innin was not the only one of the great gods to be incorporated into the scenes of conflict, although in her case the reason for the interpo- lation can easily be understood. Twice Ea, holding the flowing vase, is attended by his minister, the bifrons Usmû (4). On a seal from Ur the god Nannar, holding a reversed spear surmounted by a crescent, sets one foot on a crouching man-headed bull while he receives a worshipper, apparently oblivious of the contest raging in the back- ground (6). It has been suggested that when the chief protagonist carried a bow the weapon identified him as Ninurta (®). The attitude of the bow-bearer in a single example (7), however, is frequently assumed by a god characterized as a sun-god by darting rays, who appears to be closely akin to Shamash if not actually assimilated to him. It seems probable that whoever the original hero of the slaying of Kingu may have been, the rapid growth of the cult of Shamash in the Akkadian period caused him to be accredited with the heroic deeds which in earlier times were attributed to other deities. Owing to the active part taken in the series by a sun-god it is not strange that in seals belonging to the fully developed period of Akkadian art the figure of Shamash, the Sun-god par excellence , should be shown in his characteristic guise and attitude. The scene where the dead body of Kingu is brought to him has been discussed (Fig. 9) (8).

The scene representing a divinity conducting a man with a goat to Shamash rising between the mountains in the traditional manner (2) is connected with the series under discussion only by the figure of a god who has sunk on one knee beside the mountain with both arms flung wide in the attitude of utter abandonment often depicted in the battle series (3). L,et us hear the conclusion of the whole matter (4), which is reveal- ed to us by a fine seal which pictures the culminating episode and its results, for it depicts the death of Kingu and what happened in conse- quence (Fig. 22) (6). All the figures except one are nude and have horned caps of various types, thus indicating that the protagonists are divinities, and the events illustrated occurred in the world of the gods and not on earth. The narrative begins with the death of Kingu who has sunk down feebly on the stones, his arms trailing limply on each side of him. His adversary, drawn on a slightly larger scale, is designated as a god by the divine determinative close to his head. He grasps a horn of Kingu's head-dress, and makes ready to deal the death-blow with his mace. Behind him another god raises both hands aloft as if to express his astonishment at what he sees, but at the same time his feet are beginning to bear him in the opposite direction so that he may tell the news of what has taken place. All the remaining figures are on a much smaller scale, and are occupied in manual labour, for they are busied about the construction of a building. The first uses his hoe to rake up mud to mix with water in a big vessel and so make the mortar with which a second worker has filled a basket which he carries on his head so that he can take the mortar to the divine mason working on the roof who awaits it, and to accomplish this he climbs nimbly up a ladder leaning against a wall near a gateway. But both the climber and the first worker pause momentarily and turn back their heads to find out what has happened. The divine mason on the right edge of the roof kneels on one knee (!) B.

The only clothed figure is that of a small seated god who appears to pour something from a big vessel into the smaller vase visible near the body of the news-bearer; the big vessel resembles the one in which the mortar is mixed. Thus in a single scene a continuous narrative is unfolded, for we are shown the death of Kingu, and then how the gods, jubilant at the final overthrow of their enemies, decided to express their gratitude to the victor by building for him a palace in the heavens (*).
