(Harvard East Asian Monographs, v. 119.) 135 + xiv pp., 76 black-and-white figures, bibliography, and glossary. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985. $30.00. Shinzo: Hachiman Imagery and Its Development is the first monograph written in English on Shinto sculpture. Christine Guth Kanda introduces the Western reader to the problems of the long-neglected field of Shinto art by focusing on the Hachiman cult and its imagery. The appearance of the Shinto god Hachiman, commonly represented in the guise of a Buddhist monk with shaven head, underlines the syncretic nature of Shinto art and the importance of Buddhism in its formation. Kanda makes the point, however, that we can understand these works only by exploring the strands of native beliefs, commonly termed Shinto, that lie at their core. The multifacted approach taken by Kanda in this book, which is a revision of her Ph.D. dissertation (Harvard, 1976), introduces the reader to the methodologies of such eminent Japanese scholars as Naomi Oka, Shuichi Murayama, and Haruki Kageyama. Kanda divides her monograph into two parts. Part I provides a general introduction to Shinto imagery and places the Hachiman cult in its chronological context. The four chapters in this section survey Japanese attitudes toward the kami (Shinto gods), the rise of anthropomorphic images, the two main types of iconography (courtly and synthetic, or Buddhist), the formal development of Shinto wood sculpture, patronage, and devotional practices. A discussion of the Hachiman cult at Usa Shrine, Todai-ji, Iwashimizu Shrine, and Tsurugaoka Shrine provides background for the later examination of specific cult objects. Part II focuses of three important work of the Hachiman cult: a Hachiman triad in To-ji, another triad in Yakushi-ji, and a single statue in Todai-ji. Using these three case studies Kanda discusses the devlopment of Shinto wood sculptural techniques and styles from the ninth through the thirteenth century. The To-ji triad represents wood-core lacquer-style statues of the early Heian period; the Todai-ji image, dated and signed by Kaikei, exemplifies the naturalistic joined-wood style of the Kei school in the early Kamakura period. Many other sculptures from the Buddhist and Shinto traditions are also cited to clarify stylistic and iconographic points. The figures provide a wealth of material for reference that is difficult to find otherwise. Although Kanda's broadly based survey in Part I is espe- cially useful as an introduction to the subject, more detailed examination of certain problems included here still remains to be done. For example, Kanda discusses the origins of Shinto sculpture and classifies the earliest images into two broad types: courtly and syncretic (or Buddhist). Both ap- pear in early Hachiman triads, which are comprised of one male deity dressed as a Buddhist monk and two female deities appearing in courtly garb, and it would be useful to seek the sources of these iconographies. Hachiman, as Kanda notes, was probably not the only Shinto deity to be represented as a Buddhist monk. What do we know about some of the other early wood sculptures of Buddhist deities, such as Jizo and Monju, who also appear as monks? Are there grounds for believing that some of these figures, which appear outwardly as Bodhisattvas, were actually Shinto deities underneath? In his book on Shinto sculpture Naomi Oka repeatedly points out that the earliest Shinto sculptures appear to be linked to shrines assoiated with immigrant clans and that the images themselves may be tied to ancestor worship. Ongoing research on folk traditions in China and especially Korea may uncover possible sources of influence for these early life-sized wooden court-style Shinto images. A dearth of documentation and a lack of comparative materials stand as formidable barriers against establishing a precise chronology for Shinto sculpture. We can see this in the problems associated with the dating of the two Hachiman triads discussed in Part II. Although a consensus of Japanese scholarly opinion dates both the To-ji and Yakushi-ji triads to the ninth century, these two sets of images exhibit great differences in scale, technique, and style. The To-ji triad seems consistent with other mid-ninth century wood sculpture. The problem lies with accepting a late-ninth century date for the Yakushi-ji images. Oka, the leading authority on Shinto sculpture, attributes this triad to the late tenth or early eleventh century based on his reading of pertinent documents and stylistic comparisons. Kanda, finding that the documentary evidence does not fully support either opinion, assigns this triad to the early tenth century. Her view that this triad inaugurates the wood-style statuary of the late Heian period, however, suggests that Oka's later dating may have validity. Kanda's monograph on Shinto sculpture falls squarely within a newly developing trend in Western scholarship on Japanese religion and religious art. For many years scholars have tended to emphasize the continental Buddhist tradition, while neglecting the contributions of nature religious developments. Recently, however, scholars have begun placing more emphasis on the indigenous aspects of the Japanese religious tradition, specifically including the intermingling of the great tradition of Buddhism with native Japanese beliefs. The two go hand in hand and must be considered together. Studies on Japanese folk religion, the honji suijaku theory, and shugendo make up an important part of this trend. So, too, do studies on Shinto art. Shinzo: Hachiman Imagery and Its Development, complementing Kanda's other work in the field of Shinto art, makes an important contribution to the body of research that is leading towards a clearer picture of the early development of Japanese religious beliefs and a more penetrating analysis of the most definite statement of these beliefs, the visual arts.</page></plain_text>
