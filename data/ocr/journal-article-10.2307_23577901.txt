In this final volume of Telling, VR searches for understanding of the God whom we believe and experience. His work is neither a variation on classic treatises on the "One</page><page sequence="2">192 GREGORIANUM, VOL. 69 (1988) FASC. 1: LIBRI NOSTRI God", nor a full trinitarian theology. Throughout he considers Him/Them: Father, Jesus, and Holy Spirit. He treats here mostly the questions which figure in the theology of the One God, yet his work is distinctive in several ways. Preliminary considerations deal with the roles of naturai knowledge of God in Christian life and theology, biblical conceptions of God, and three philosophical develop ments. One is the abortive effort of platonizing Fathers. Two others are rich, positive contributions to understanding: an existential metaphysics, and a reflection on structures of human experience and the human way of being. The body of the work is organized according to the transcendentals, in a significant order. Every theme begins with a brief summary of belief and experience, and then is developed in two phases: philosophical-metaphysical, and theological. "He Is / They Are", in the metaphysical phase, grounds the affirmation that God is. VR freely reworks the classic "five ways", and adds two. Stili in the metaphysical phase, he performs the needed critique of metaphysical language, and points out the linguistic crisis of metaphysical language, in which one must fashion linguistic "monstrosities" at the pain of smothering metaphysics in "proper English." At the term of the metaphysical effort, regarding God as To Be itself subsisting, he reflects on the hybrid quasi-abstract infinitive and the existential corrective in the concrete participle. Here, as in treatment of the other transcendentals, a metaphysician opts for the abstract, to avoid any suggestion of composition in what we cali God. Asking whether this is philosophy or theology, and whether it suffices, he answers that it is purely metaphysical, and that it does not suffice for Christian theology. Moving into the theological phase, VR opts for the divine name, "I Am." Only God, in divine-human symbolizing, can affirm absolutely "I Am." Only by absolute concrete existential affirmations "He Is" and "You Are" can we express least imperfectly the "essence" of the God whom we believe and whom we experience in transcendent divine-human relationship. In the light of revelation and belief, reflecting on the unique world in which we live in Them, VR retraces the "ways" by which we come to affirm and understand somewhat the God who alone makes our transcendent Christian being and experience possible and intelligible. Having grounded the affirmation that God is, that He is / They Are absolutely, VR moves to questions regarding God in Himself/Themselves. He deals first with what is necessary for the understanding of aspects of divine knowledge and love: that He is / They are simple, immutable, and eternai. Ali questions regarding divine intellect, knowledge, and truth are treated under the transcendental true: He is / They are True, absolutely. Ali that regards divine will, love, and good are considered under the transcendental good: again, only of Him/Them can we affirm Good absolutely, transcendently, eminently. Theological treatment of divine intellect and knowledge, will and love, is to be understood of what He is / They are eminently, since in God ali real distinction of essence or nature, power, act, and perfection attained by act collapses. The transcendental one is treated last, for obviously the mystery of divine transcen dent interpersonal knowledge and love calls for an understanding of God's oneness which transcends ali purely metaphysical understanding. He is / They are One, not only absolutely in the simplicity, undividedness, indivisibility, and uniqueness of their being, but also in their transcendent interpersonal oneness of communion of mutuai knowledge and love. Having considered Him/Them in Himself/Themselves, VR deals with principal questions regarding Flis/Their operation: (1) power and presence, (2) eternai decree and execution, (3) rightness and mercy. In the second, he considers providence, universal salvific will, and predestination and reprobation. Finally, having come continually to the brink of trinitarian theology, VR asks whether another model could complement the classic psychological model which has prevailed for centuries. He suggests a transcendental model: not metaphysical, since we are concerned with transcendent divine interpersonal union and distinction, a mystery which lies beyond</page><page sequence="3">GREGORIANUM, VOL. 69 (1988) FASC. 1: LIBRI NOSTRI 193 more than a possible conjecture on the part of a metaphysician. The basic analogy of true and good would be retained, but the degree of residuai anthropomorphism could be reduced. Procession from intellect and will must be understood by more thoroughgoing application of the triple phase of ali human thought and language about God: affirmation of perfections of intellect and will, knowledge and love, procession of a word and outpouring of self in love; denial of the imperfections of the human mode, with its distinctions and real composition; and truly transcendent, eminent affirmation of Them as absolutely True and Good. Our very imperfect understanding of transcendent divine mutuai interpersonal knowledge and love must be extended to embrace the mystery of what we believe of the mutuai knowledge and love of Father and Son, Father and Spirit, Son and Spirit. VR compares and contrasts the two models and suggests and replies to possible difficulties regarding the transcendental model. A concluding reflection looks back on the course of the effort to understand, and ponders the role of theology in the continuing personal-interpersonal dialectic in which we are engaged. Beginning within Christian experience, the theologian comes full cycle in a deepening and enriching of experience. Setting forth what we can somehow understand, the theologian offers what should evoke a response in which we come together to deeper understanding, and to a renewed, more meaningful response: "You Are!"</page></plain_text>
