SZEMERÈNYI The name of the Dorians Having shown that earlier explanations are untenable, the speaker first examined the thesis recently advanced by several British scholars that the Dorians did not come to the Peloponnese after the collapse of the Mycenaean empire but were already present in it - as a subject population - and asked whether in that case their name could reflect that status (for example, do-e-ro ). If this view be rejected, he put the question whether the name represents do(h)eros "man" (now well documented from Indo-Iranian languages), showing a type of name-giving frequently encountered in history (as, for instance, allemand).</page><page sequence="2">184 BICS 30 (1983) 17 November 1982 DR ROBIN HÄGG Epiphany in Minoan Ritual Since the works of M.P. Nilsson, B. Schweitzer and particularly F. Matz it seems generally agreed that "epiphany" is a key word for the understanding of Minoan religion and ritual. Their conclusions were based on the analysis of numerous representations in art, especially in glyptic works, as well as on plastic representations and painting. In this paper I shall try to reconstruct something of the actual ritual connected with the epiphany of the Minoan deities, an aspect not treated in previous research. My main subject (since I shall not treat the epiphany of deities in the shape of birds or snakes) will be the anthropomorphic epiphany of the New Palace period, as illustrated in thé art and reflected in the architecture of the time. I shall assume that such epiphany in fact was of two kinds: ecstatic epiphany , a vision seen by an individual or a group of worshippers either spontaneously or through appropriate cult practices; and performed or enacted epiphany , in which the deity appearing to the worshippers is played by a human (a priest, or the king or queen), who acts in the ritual as the personification of the deity. (This phenomenon is known from other cultures and has been assumed by Matz and others for Crete.) The types of pictorial representations that may throw light upon the occurrence of epiphany are four: (1) cult scenes, where only humans are pictured, and no deity. There are many examples depicting the rites of klēsis, that were meant to call the deity to appear, most important the sacred dance. Typical are the "Holy Grove miniature fresco" from Knossos and many glyptic scenes, especially on gold rings. (2) Scenes where deities interact with human worshippers; the category on which Schweitzer, Matz and Furumark concentrated. Best-known examples are the "Mother-of-the-Mountain" sealings from Knossos and other glyptic scenes in which a small divine figure hovers in the air or descends to the worshippers (the Isopata ring, for instance). Common to groups (1) and (2) is the fact that human worshippers are depicted, with or without marked divine presence, and it is logical to assume that these scenes in fact represent the ritual performed in connection with epiphany. Since in most cases the locality of the epiphany is indicated, it was clearly of importance. Thus epiphany was a regular element in the cult; as such it was naturally bound to certain places and occasions, invoked through the appropriate ritual. A small deity depicted as hovering in the air could be understood merely as a sign of divine presence, a presence felt but normally not seen. It could also, on the other hand, denote a vision, perceived by the individual worshipper or the whole group of people present. This is what I term ecstatic epiphany, and here it does not really matter whether the divine presence was seen or merely felt by the worshippers. The remaining groups depict deities: (3) scenes with deities in the divine sphere, without humans but inter- acting with non-human attendants (demons) or fabulous animals (griffins). For the demons, there is a dilemma of interpretation: are they non-human attendants of the deity, or human worhsippers or priests disguised as demons? In the latter case, which appears less likely, such scenes would depict actual ritual, with both deity and worshippers as humans in disguise (enacted or performed epiphany). (4) Hieratic representations of deities in a stiff heraldic scheme, in which there is no action. The deity is usually shown frontally, flanked by griffins or lions in a symmetrical, antithetic composition. These representations may not be seen as cult scenes; the frontal figures, however, are reminiscent of cult images. Examples are found in glyptic art, especially a series of seals with a goddess holding, or appearing below, a so-called snake-frame. Certainly the accompanying griffins appear to indicate that no scene from reality can be depicted on these seals - what the artist depicts must instead be a vision or an imaginary scene. But in 1956, Helga Reusch published (in Minoica, pp. 334-358) an ingenious hypothesis combining the seals of this group with the idea of the enacted epiphany. She observed - as Evans had done before - that on several seals the flanking griffins are set at a higher level than the central female figure, and associated the seal representations with the frescoes on the north wall of the Throne Room at Knossos. If this throne was occupied not by a king but by a priestess appearing as the Minoan goddess, the scene of her standing in front of the throne during the ritual, with the</page><page sequence="3">BICS 30 (1983) 185 griffin fresco as a back-drop, would correspond well enough with the picture on the seals to be explained as the source of inspiration of the seal-engravers. In spite of some weaknesses, the hypothesis of the Throne Room as one of the places where epiphany was enacted is still worth considering seriously. Turning now to the architectural evidence, we must seek arrangements suitable for the enactment of epiphany, beside the Throne Room. We may perhaps assume that a suitable place would require the same criteria as a cult image, for instance, being marked as important architecturally by being at a higher level, in a niche, and/or centrally placed in a symmetrical arrangement. It is assumed that no cult images existed in Crete during the palatial period. Three buildings at Knossos fulfil these requirements: the Royal Villa; the House of the Chancel Screen; and the High Priest's House. All three contain a room with an approximately E-W orientation, in which the focus of attention, marked through axiality and elevation, is always at the western end. In one case, there was a seat of honour in a niche. Could it be that these three rooms - and perhaps the complete buildings, with pillar-crypts and lustral basins - were intended for religious ceremonies, especially of enacted epiphany? Another locality where enacted epiphany may have taken place is the so-called East Hall at Knossos, restored by Evans at the centre of the east side of the Central Court, where were found fragments of painted stucco reliefs, associated with a place of prestige. Among these remains were pieces identified by B. Kaiser as parts of a magnificent snake-frame some 3.5m across. Could it be that this snake-frame was impressive enough to have inspired the gem-engravers at Knossos when they were making the seals of category (4) above? In conclusion, I think that the anthropomorphic epiphany was a predominant element in Minoan ritual in the period of the new palaces, when there were no cult images. The ecstatic epiphany ritual normally took place outdoors and is known to us only through pictorial representations, whereas the enacted epiphany seems to have been mainly in indoor ritual, reflected both in pictorial art of various kinds and in architectural arrangements.</page><page sequence="4">186 BICS 30 (1983) 15 December 1982 GERALD C ADOGAN The first season of new excavations at Maroni in Cyprus The first season of a new excavation at Maroni Vournes in Cyprus ended just over a month ago. The work was carried out at the generous invitation of the Director of the Department of Antiquities, Dr Vassos Karageorghis, and with the unstinting help of the Department in all matters, large or small; it is sponsored by the Department of Classics of the University of Cincinnati and supported by the Semple Classics Fund of the University of Cincinnati: to all in Nicosia and Cincinnati I ám most grateful. Earlier work at Maroni of the British Museum, at Vournes and principally at Tsaroukas in 1897, found LC II tombs and evidence of LC I, with Minoan, Mycenaean and Near Eastern imports. The available information has been collected by Dr Jane Johnson in Maroni de Chypre {SIMA 59, Gothenburg, 1980). The principal aim of the new excavations is to establish the sequence of habitation at Maroni, and so to contribute to understanding the history of Cyprus around the time, and just before, the first settlers came from the Aegean. To this end, the first season at Vournes , a low hillock about 500m from the sea, has gone well. It has shown that the earliest use of the site belongs so far to LC IA, and perhaps even to MC III, the time when several other important centres on the south and east coasts of Cyprus were founded. A long sequence of habitation covering LC I and especially LC II is beginning to appear, with large buildings with fine ashlar masonry belonging to the latter phase. Many of the ashlar blocks had been robbed in later times, but the quality of what survives is comparable to that of Kition or Enkomi. The use of the LC II building(s) is not yet clear, but it may be that we have a shrine, similar perhaps to that at Myrtou Pigadhes . Five pithoi have been found sunk in the LC II floors, perhaps used to collect the winter rains. One pithos had two fragments of a yellow and blue faience goblet with relief decoration of stylised lotus petals. Other finds include a probable stylus, made from a cow's rib, which would denote literacy; parts of two or three Mycenaean kraters with horse and chariot scenes; and a loomweight with a Cypro-Minoan inscription. Four tombs were found, of which only one was well preserved: their presence could argue against the hypothesis that Vournes was a Late Cypriot shrine. An unusual find was what appears to be a lime-plasterer's workshop. Several recent pits were found, probably those dug by the British Museum team, and, at the top of the hillock, the remains of a sanctuary of Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic times. Little architecture is preserved, but there is some seventh-century pottery, a few Archaic terracotta figurines and some 45 small limestone statues of votaries, a few of which may be as early as Early Classical but most of which are Hellenistic, probably of the third century. The terracotta head of a pig may suggest that this was a sanctuary of Demeter. Work next year will concentrate on the Late Cypriot levels, to try to settle whether there really was a Bronze Age predecessor of the later sanctuary, and to uncover more of the ashlar buildings and of the LC I and earlier levels. It is interesting that no pottery that can immediately be assigned to LC III has yet been observed. On present evidence the ashlar buildings belong to the thirteenth century.</page><page sequence="5">BICS 30 (1983) 187 16 February 1983 DR O.H. KRZYSZKOWSKA Ivory Carving in the Late Bronze Age Aegean In spite of recent attention to the subject, several questions of Late Bronze Age ivory-carving still await satisfactory answers. Allied to the subject of ivory-working itself is the use of related animal by-products - bone, antler, and boar's tusk. Correct identification is vital, as it can reveal "substitution" of a local material for ivory. In the Late Bronze Age, pins often thought to be of ivory are in fact usually made from bone, a substance more resilient under stress. The source of ivory for Late Bronze Age Aegean carving is commonly held to be the Syrian elephant, an extinct sub-species of the Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus) rather than the African variety Loxodonta africana. Scientific evidence in support of this view is not good, but circumstantial evidence seems to indicate that Syria was the most likely source by the Late Bronze Age in the Aegean. For the earlier part of the Bronze Age, the use of African ivory traded via Egypt must remain a possibility. Hippopotamus tusk, notably the large lower canine teeth, may also have provided ivory for Aegean carvers. Two segments of tusk, one worked (from an EM context at Knossos) and one unworked (from the Citadel House, Mycenae), offer the first direct evidence that hippopotamus tusk was reaching the Aegean during the Bronze Age. Before the Late Bronze Age only Crete had any notable tradition of ivory-working, chiefly in the form of seals from the pre-palatial period. But it is difficult to trace the origins and development of Late Bronze Age Cretan ivory-carving due to gaps in the evidence for the First Palace Period. By the Second Palace Period the craft displays a high degree of technical expertise and considerable inventiveness in subject. The series of mainland ivories begins with the later Shaft Graves and burials of the LHI- II period, and may have developed without external influence. The forms of such objects as pyxides and combs change markedly in the LHIII A period, when all features of Mycenaean carving become standardised. The question of some Cretan influence (in forms, not motifs) at this stage in the development of mainland carving remains open. With the discovery and study of workshop material in the form of rough-outs, off-cuts and trial pieces, we can begin to build up a picture of the Late Bronze Age ivory-worker's tool kit and techniques. Nonetheless, far more attention must be paid to the kinds of marks produced by specific tool types (both in stone and in bronze), and experimental work must be undertaken before a satisfactory understanding of Late Bronze Age ivory working may be achieved. The identification of workshops similarly remains a problem, resting on the discovery of partially worked ivory, workers' debris or pieces awaiting assembly. Those sites which have yielded such material include Knossos (Royal Road), Palaikastro, Zakro; Ayia Irini (Kea); Nichoria, Thebes (Kadmeia), Pylos and Mycenae (Artisans' Quarter, Houses of Shields and Sphinxes, the Citadel House).</page><page sequence="6">188 BICS 30 (1983) 16 March 1983 LUCIA NIXON Settlement patterns and coastal development in LM Crete While archaeologists generally are aware of the importance of Crete's overseas connections in the Bronze Age, they have paid little attention to the problems of local communication on a mountainous island with few roads. The object of the seminar was to suggest that short-haul, on-island shipping played an important role in the transport of goods on Crete; and that accessibility by sea as well as by land should always be kept in mind when archaeologists consider Minoan distribution routes, as in provenance studies of items trans- ported from one part of Crete to another. The notion of marine accessibility might also help to associate subsidiary sites with the appropriate centre. The seminar concencentrated on LM I because the neo-palatial period provides the best evidence for diversified settlement types, as well as a distinctive form of material culture linking many parts of the island. Research in geography can shed light on some of these problems. Isochronic maps may be used to compare the relative land and sea accessibility of sites near a given centre; and ratios of coastal length to area to predict general numbers of ports, though not their precise location. Some theoretical work has been done on the hinterlands of large coastal centres. A brief discussion of short-haul shipping on Vancouver Island in the 1930s provides a modern parallel. Information is available from other ancient sources apart from Minoan archaeology, for example, shipping of the classical period; the investigation of wrecks, particularly that off Cape Gelidonya; and contemporary texts, such as the two Egyptian New Kingdom ship's logs. Much is known about ports and sailing directions for Crete in post-Minoan periods, from Ptolemy to Piri Reis to the Mediterranean Pilot . Similarly, comparative data on regional centres and administration exist for Hellenistic, Roman, Venetian, Turkish and modern Crete. The combination of geography, ancient sources, later Cretan history and the LM I archaeological evidence permits certain suggestions to be made. The existence of a formally organised "coastal highway" around Crete is debatable. There seems to be no specifically coastal type of settlement, although towns occur more often on coasts than inland. Larger coastal settlements are found on the north and east coasts; smaller ones on the west and south. The eastern end of Crete is more fully developed (in a relative sense) in the Bronze Age than in any other period to date. Coastal settlements in general are not evenly spaced - most are much closer than a day's sail apart; nor do "villas", perhaps serving as collection centres for agricultural produce, seem to be located at regular intervals. Most of the larger centres probably have mixed (coastal and inland) hinterlands; Kato Zakro, a neo-palatial foundation, apparently has an almost entirely coastal hinterland. While most of the island seems to have come under some form of centralised administration in LM I, the western part of the south coast may not have been under such direct control. Coastal traffic would generally have been seasonal, involving different kinds of ships and cargo, and possibly more than one level of organisation.</page><page sequence="7">BICS 30 (1983) 189 4 May 1983 MR D.J.L. BENNET The Linear B Administration at Knossos and the archaeology of Late Minoan III Crete: some considerations The paper was a summary of work in progress for a PhD from the Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge. Two bodies of data were considered: the Linear B documents from Knossos and the archae- ological information available for LM III Crete, the so-called "post-palatial period". Knossos alone was thought to have fulfilled the role of a central place in LM III Crete. The total absence of traces of a Linear B archive elsewhere on the island at the time was considered significant, particularly when the distribution was compared with that of Linear A tablets and roundels, and of Linear B texts on the mainland. The Inscribed Stirrup-Jars were not deemed to be part of an archive, and a more suitable term for this period would be the "mono-palatial period". The palace's interests in the rest of the island were recorded against toponyms thought to number a little over 100: probably close to the number in the original archive. Generally, toponyms could be assumed to belong to occupation sites, although about 20 (of rare occurrence) probably referred to cult sites. Six toponyms were accepted as identifiable ( ko-no-so, a-mi-ni-so, tu-ri-so, pa-i-to, a-pa-ta-wa and ku-do-ni-ia ), and these gave a rough estimate of the extent of Knossos' interests: Khania to Amnisos (west to east) and Amnisos to Phaistos (north to south). Archaeological evidence was of assistance here: for example, ra- to = Aarcj was rejected for lack of evidence of Minoan habitation, whereas ku-do-ni-ia = Xaviá and a-pa-ta-wa = " knrepa were supported by finds and by association with toponyms.thought to be West Cretan on grounds of clay analysis (see Catling et al, ABSA 75 [1980] 49 ff.). This was consistent with an estimate based on the land area required by Knossos' 100,000 sheep: one quarter to one-third of the island. The relative geography of the toponyms was taken up, using A.L. Wilson's isolation of five geographical groups among 29 toponyms of high occurrence in the archive (Wilson, Minos 16 [1977] 91). General locations were assigned to the groups on the basis of the identifiable toponym "fixes": a group extending from the western Mesara, west of Psiloriti, to the Rethymnon-Stavromenos region on the north coast (I); a group around Knossos itself (III); a group in the west, around Khania and the Apokoronas (IV); and a group probably to the east and south of the Knossos group (II). Closer examination of the toponyms in these groups showed two features: a tendency for the proportion of "owners" to increase with distance from Knossos (figures from Wilson), and a decrease in frequency of occurrence with distance, except for the closest group (III). The suggested reason was a greater administrative concern with areas at one or more remove from Knóssos, whereas the local region could be dealt with directly (for example, the ?taxation documents Og 833/E 749). The possibility that the "owners" were of some importance in the administrative system was suggested. The geographical status of Wilson's fifth group ( ko-no-so, a-mi-ni-so , se-to-i-ja ) was queried, and the suggestion offered that it represented a group of high-level places distinguished by co-occurrence with Knossos. An analysis of the documents As 40, As(2) 1510 and B 777 showed that other places were involved, which could not be geographically proximate to Knossos: pa-i-to, ku-ta-to and da-* 22- to. These were assumed to be second-order centres. Further evidence of their status was offered by their presence in the Sc, Sd and So texts, on which basis ku-do-ni-ia (Sd 4044) was added to the list. The archaeological history of three of these sites (Knossos, Khania and Phaistos), which shows continuity and re-use in LM II, suggested a mode of expansion for the Knossos system in the LM III period by incorporation of places which had already existed as centres in LM I. The limited distribution of LM II pottery in West and East Crete was held to support this, and the tentative proposals were offered that the existence of LM II in the Rethymnon region might indicate da- *2 2- to' s location, and its presence at Mallia might suggest a location for se-to-i-ja.</page><page sequence="8">190 BICS 30 (1983) After speculation on the origin of such an administration, the period of its operation was considered, taking three examples of known toponyms and relating them to archaeological information: 1 . Tylissos was probably an example of a third-order centre (perhaps a feature of the Knossos area alone). Some important LM III architecture supported this identification based on tu-ri-so' s presence on the Ce 59 oxen record (a specialised resource recorded by the palace at widely distributed sites) and on the list Og 833, which may represent a local tax record. 2. It was tentatively suggested that the pairing of pa-i-to and da-wo (Dn 1094) might reflect the proximity of Phaistos and Ayia Triadha, the presence of large LM III storage buildings at the latter site perhaps being linked to the 10,000 [units of grain recorded against da-wo on F(2) 852. 3. Khania's status was considered briefly. Its political links with Knossos were contrasted with its appearance as an economic centre. This was not seen as inconsistent, for the involvement of its area in the Knossos system appear to be /«direct. The emergence of a distinctive high-quality pottery style there, as in other areas of LM III Crete, might indicate economic importance rather than political in- dependence. Nevertheless, it was noted that there existed a degree of ambiguity about Khania's precise relationship with Knossos (especially with reference to the Inscribed Stirrup-Jars) as long as the dating of the Knossos archive remained unclear.</page><page sequence="9">BICS 30 (1983) 191 25 May 1983 PROFESSOR S. IAKOVIDIS The fortress of Gla : present state of research Unlike the better known Mycenaean citadels and palaces, Gla was not the seat of authority of a state, however small, but a fortress, containing a relatively modest residential building and several large utilitarian structures. It is situated in the north east corner of the Copais basin on a pear-shaped rock which dominated by its position the system of dykes and canals built by the Minyans to divert the water of the rivers flowing into the basin to the natural swallets in the cliff around it in order to drain the lake. The site is not mention- ed by ancient authors and its original name has been lost. It was partly investigated by A. de Ridder in 1 893 and by J. Threpsiades in 1 95 5-6 1 . Since 1 979 the excavation has been resumed by the speaker. The fortification wall, 3km long and 5-6m thick, is characterized by shallow vertical recesses which break up the face into short straight stretches. This technique is imposed by the local stone, which naturally breaks into slabs and makes building along curved lines difficult. The enceinte had four gates, one each on the west, north and south sides, and one near the south east end of the rock. They were approached from the plain by paths leading up the slope or by long inclines and ramps. The entrances were flanked by bastion-like thickenings of the wall, the space between being divided by strong wooden doors into outer and inner courts. The latter had guardrooms or walls on both sides. The west and the south gates had stone-built ramps leading to the ramparts. The south east gate had two entrances, one leading to the walled-off eastern part of the rock and the other to a centrally situated enclosure which contains most of the buildings: in the north part is the residential building, the melathron, consisting of two identical wings meeting at an angle and each having a megaron-like unit with no throne or hearth and a series of small apartments connected by corridors. The walls had a stone-built sockle and a superstructure of mud-brick, covered with painted plaster and decorated with fluted stucco colonnettes observed by de Ridder but since vanished. Doors had well-dressed stone thresholds and wooden jambs. The door leaves revolved on bronze pivot shoes: four are mentioned by de Ridder, and a fifth was discovered by Threpsiades. In the south part of the enclosure were two long building complexes separated by an open space. The east complex is now under investigation. The west, excavated by Threpsiades, consists of a very long narrow structure with rough stone bases along its axis for wooden columns to support the roof and of rooms and apartments at either end. Against the outer wall at the north end of the structure a pile of carefully-stacked roof tiles was uncovered, and more tiles were found in the fill that covered the buildings. The arrangement of both buildings in the south enclosure and the finds they yielded (storage jars, carbonized grain, for example) show that they were granaries and warehouses built to store the produce from the plain. The proximity of the main dykes and the vast storage capacity of the warehouses show that the fortress must have been the control point for both the drainage system and the harvesting of the crops. This suggests in turn that the occupants of the two wings of the melathron, clearly two officials of equal standing, may well each have been in charge of one of these important functions. The ceramic finds, both those found in context and those collected from disturbed layers, are surprisingly homogeneous and show that the site went through two periods of occupation only: first there is a fair scatter of sherds all over the rock belonging to the Neolithic Elateia phase (5000-4500 B.C.). Then comes the bulk of the pottery, consisting mainly of stemmed kylikes, stemless conical bowls, skyphoi, both with running and with panel decoration, and a few fragmentary stirrup jars. They show that the fortification and the buildings inside it were built at the transition from LHIII A2 to LHIII B1 and were destroyed and abandoned early in LHIII B2. In other words, the lake was drained and the plain was cultivated during the first 60-70 years of the 13th century B.C.</page></plain_text>
