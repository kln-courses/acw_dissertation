<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS "La pioggia nel pineto" is the most popular of the poems and universally rated as his best. The pine grove, as the poet and his companion Erminione stroll through it, is filled with the notes of the cicadas and frogs and the rustle of the pines, myrtles, and junipers. Their sylvan music is provided with orches- tration by means of a masterly choice of words, rhythms and cadences turning the whole lyric into a beautiful verbal symphony. Before the rain is over, both humans are magically transformed into arbores- cent creations. Here we have another type of myth-it might be described as a naturalization -the inverse of anthropomorphism, it, too, common in classical mythology (cf. the metamorphosis of Niobe into a stone and Daphne into a laurel). Approximately one half of the poems are repro- duced either fully or partially. Had its editor re- printed the entire collection, 303 pages in the 1939 Vittoriale degli italiani volume, its length would ob- viously have eliminated it as a classroom text. Overall, however, representation is adequate; only a bare minimum of outstandingly significant or favorite pieces are excluded. The twenty-page introduction consists of two parts, the first being a chronological-biographical exposi- tion leading up to the appearance of Alcyone. The second part contrasts and compares Maia and Elettra with it. Emphasis is placed on D'Annunzio's musi- cality and his use of many types of metrical forms and rhetorical devices. It is these experiments that have helped to make him the most influential poet in con- temporary Italy. For him, his summer sojourn in Tuscany "was a time of beauty. . . . Pleasure in that beauty is in itself sufficient reason for reading the book, but to the sensitive soul, D'Annunzio has a further appeal. He revivifies the sentiments of magic which are found in nature, and reintroduces his readers, with fresh spontaneity, to mysteries 'fashioned from earth, air, fire and water, and fer- mented with passion,' upon which our own age is turning its back but which still lie at the heart of our European cultural heritage" (p. 20). With reference to musicality, incidentally, it may be added that all of his poems are permeated by it. In Alcyone, as Ver- laine had done before him, D'Annunzio uses "versi- fied music" to evoke his sensations. A "Bio-Bibliographical Note" conveniently com- plements the data in Professor Woodhouse's introduc- tion and extends it to 1937. In the "Select Bibliog- raphy" we might note that Forcella's repertoire has been reprinted by Ben Franklin (New York, 1973). A word-for-word checking in a dozen poems has convinced me that the English equivalents of the Italian originals in the vocabulary section come as close to preciseness as equivalents can be. The notes are carefully chosen and illuminating. For certain poems, borrowings and echoes from other writers are indicated here and there. In "Ditirambo IV," where D'Annunzio presents himself as a modern Icarus, the composition is cited as a reworking of material in Ovid's Metamorphoses VIII. This is essen- tially correct. However, neither he nor any of the other annotators, as far as I can ascertain, hint that its real stimulus was very likely Tansillo's famous Icarus sonnet: "Amor m'impenna l'ale . ." (Here, too, the son of Daedalus personifies the poet.) The evidence is visible in the closing quatrain. Compare Icaro, Icaro, anch'io nel profondo Mare precipiti, anch'io v'inabissi la mia virtu, ma in eterno in eterno il nome mio resti al Mare profondo! with Tansillo's Che s'altri cui disio simil compunse die nome eterno al mar col suo morire ove l'ardite penne il sol disgiunse, il mondo ancor di te potra ben dire, questi aspir6 a le stelle e s'ei non giunse la vita venne men, non gia l'ardire. The notes on all of the pieces are further prefaced by brief aesthetic appreciations and other pertinent in- formation. Meters employed in them are also regis- tered. This facilitates the reader's approach to them. Besides providing us with a model edition of a text, Professor Woodhouse has for the first time made it possible for students of Italian in the English-speaking world to enjoy the poetry of D'Annunzio, a privilege which most students have hitherto been denied. JOSEPH G. FUCILLA Northwestern University TRETTEL, FLAVIO AND LILIA DANNENBERG. Le feste del calendario. San Francisco: Italia Mia, 1977. Pp. 59. Lefeste del calendario is something of a novelty in the area of Italian textbooks. The authors present a panorama of many of the holidays and festivals of Italy. In the introductory note they explain that the first part, Primo Corso, is intended for beginning stu- dents and the second part, Secondo Corso, for the more advanced students. Each part is divided into twelve sections, one for each month, from September to August, so as to parallel the academic calendar it- self. The selections, varying in length from a few lines to a full page, are written in an Italian which is gener- ally correct apart from a few expressions that are mis- used: "alla scuola" instead of "a scuola"; or "nella tua casa" instead of "a casa tua." A vocabulary list and a series of questions round out the format of each section. In many instances a reading in the Secondo Corso elaborates on a similar one in the Primo Corso. This arrangement of content can be pedagogically advan- tageous, but it should be pointed out that in Lefeste del calendario the stepped approach to grammar and syntax which we are led to expect is at best illusory. Such will be evident from the passages on St. 315</page><page sequence="2">THE MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL Catherine of Siena and St. Sylvester which follow: St. Catherine Primo Corso (p. 18) Secondo Corso (p. 48) I1 29 aprile e la Il 29 aprile e Santa festa di Santa Caterina Caterina da Siena, da Siena, patrona d'Italia. patrona d'Italia.

Though this reviewer finds the material uneven in that the appeal of certain selections may vary signifi- cantly from one age group to another, the authors rightly state that a knowledge of Italian holidays can enrich the students' lives. Unfortunately, there are several things which mar the good intentions of Trettel and Dannenberg and which prejudice the potential attractiveness of the book. To begin, the text is disfigured by at least twelve corrections in long- hand. (There remain two typographical errors besides those corrected: "bene ricevuti" instead of "beni ricevuti" [p. 10] and "Degasperi" instead of "De Gasperi" [p. 22].) In more than a few places the infor- mation is not completely accurate. For example: "San Francisco e patrono d'Italia perche fu il primo a usare il Vernacolo" (p. 28) and: "Palio significa premio. Si dice mettere in palio l'onore quando si rischia tutto" (p. 56). In the accompanying vocabulary the equiva- lent of "palio" is "award." It seems fair to presume that the students will come away with the notion that "palio" can be used interchangeably with "premio," whereas a brief mention of "palio" being "drappo medievale dato al vincitore di una gara" would have placed the term in its proper context. The description of certain customs tends to suggest erroneously that they are as widely observed today as in the past: the short piece on Easter in the Primo Corso (p. 19) con- tains the statement: "I1 sacerdote viene a benedire la casa"; and when Easter is treated again in the Secondo Corso (p. 49) the students are told that on Easter Monday everyone goes on picnic. The questions, as they appear in each section, are largely factual but do include a few which require the students to personalize the material read. As is true for other aspects of the book, an unevenness diminishes the intent also here. For example, there are several questions which are not really answerable by the selection on which they are based. With the limited knowledge of Italian that students would bring to the early pages of the book, it is difficult to ascertain the value of such questions as "Che e l'amore per te?" or "Perche cadono le foglie?" It is to be hoped that future editions of the book will reflect greater care and quality in their preparation. REMO J. TRIVELLI University of Rhode Island LEPSCHY, ANNA LAURA AND GlULIO LEPSCHY. The Italian Language Today. London and Salem, New Hampshire: Hutchinson and Co., 1977. Pp. 248. $29.95. Lepschy and Lepschy have given us the most impor- tant descriptive and historical work in English on Italian since T. G. Griffith in 1966 offered his abridgement and recasting of Migliorini and Baldelli, The Italian Language. The book consists of two parts: a historical account of the circumstances which produced sociolinguistic variation in contemporary Italy; and a reference grammar of contemporary edu- cated Italian, on a descriptive rather than prescriptive basis. Included in the historical section is an account of the contemporary dialects and some keen sociolin- guistic observations on their status and prospects. It is, then, a book which does not fall into a single genre; not a standard history, working from the be- ginnings to the present day, but emphasizing the past situations which produced contemporary reflexes. This approach is sound, as it avoids overlap with Mig- liorini and Baldelli, and since it addresses the needs of students and educated laymen whose main interest is in the language of today. Again, the reference gram- mar will appeal mainly to students and possibly to teachers seeking guidance on particular points. But there are drawbacks: the iniquitously high price will put the book beyond the reach of most students and many teachers, and is unjustified for a book on yellowish paper with indifferent typography and a poor, dull layout of the reference grammar. Contras- tive analyses and glosses are exclusively in British usage, and a gloss like Brit. Eng. "biro" for It. biro will leave the North American student none the wiser (the word here is ballpoint). Lepschy and Lepschy handle the phonology well; rather than laying down the law and enforcing a uni- tary, prescriptive standard, they suggest a phonologi- cal system which "foreign students of Italian may find it practical to adopt." They do not, however, deal clearly with the question of the incomplete phonologi- cal adaptation of learned words; they mention the dif- ferent phonetic reflexes of gli in, on the one hand, gli and on the other, glicerina and glicine; or of gn in gnocco and gnoseologia. Even if, from these few examples, the intelligent student perceives that it is learned, neo-classical borrowings which maintain [gl] and [gn], he may still not know how to deal with, say, 316</page></plain_text>
