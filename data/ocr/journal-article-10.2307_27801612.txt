<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aphrodite Cleopatra Wendy A. Cheshire Abstract Typological variants of a nude Aphrodite adorned with an Egyptian headdress appear frequently among the small bronzes of Hellenistic and Roman Egypt as well as in Syria. Bronze "Aphrodite" statuettes wearing a vulture's scalp as an independent diadem or in combination with a crown of feathers and a sun disc framed by cow's horns repeat a type made popular by Ptolemaic queens, whose assimilation to Nechbet, the divine mother and protector of the Pharaoh, became increasingly commonplace. In particular, Cleopatra III showed a close link to the vulture goddess of El-Kab (Eileithyiopolis) in Upper Egypt, where a sanctuary was decorated during her reign with scenes representing her eldest son and co-ruler, Ptolemy IX Soter II, in adoration of "his mother, Nechbet," presenting the vulture goddess as a divine counterpart to the queen. The Greco-Egyptian syncretistic form illustrated by a statuette of the Greek Aphrodite wearing an Egyptian headdress was brought to Syria evidently in the mid- to late second century B.c. via the Seleucid queens. Beginning in 145 B.c. with the marriage of the daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, Cleopatra Thea, to Alexander Balas, the Seleu cid queens were consistently imported from the Ptolemaic royal family, who were, in any case, by that time their close blood relatives. In certain regions of the Seleucid realm, i.e., Phoenicia and Syria, the Egyptian attributes would already have been familiar to the na tive populace on representations of the goddess Astarte or Ba'alat. A bronze statuette "from Syria" in the Louvre may probably be regarded as the initial iconographical type of a former Ptolemaic royal lady turned Seleucid queen, in an apotheosized representational form as "Aphrodite/Nechbet" or "Aphrodite/Astarte." The vulture scalp may well have been interpreted on some occasions in the Seleucid realm as a dove, the most characteristic bird found with Aphrodite. In Roman times, this syncretistic goddess, represented in several draped types, was used to express the apotheosis of Drusilla, the beloved sister of the Emperor Caligula, again in the medium of small bronzes. One bronze statuette of Faustina the Younger as Venus with Egyptian provenance and the diadem of an Egyptian queen or the divine mother of the pharaoh, Isis/Hathor, represents the Empress in native Egyptian terms as mother of the heir to power, the agent of the continuation of the dynastic line. A second bronze Venus with distinct portrait features of Faustina minor wears the crown of Isis flanked by ears of corn, a Hellenistic addition that makes reference to Egypt's role?under the auspices of the Empress, or possibly posthumously the Diva Faustina?in supplying the Mediterranean world with grain in times of need. One century ago, the Hungarian archaeologist Anton Hekler1 published a short article on a group of Hellenistic-Roman bronze statuettes typologically identifiable as "Aphrodite" but wearing on their 1 "Alexandrinische Aphroditestatuetten," Jd? 14 (1911), 112-20. 151</page><page sequence="2">152 JARCE 43 (2007) heads a vulture's scalp?the insignia of an Egyptian queen or goddess. The vulture cap is often sur mounted by an Egyptian crown, usually the diadem of two upright feathers behind a sun disc.2 On more Hellenized variants, this ensemble is flanked by a pair of ears of grain.3 The statuettes are frequently attested, not only from Egypt, but also from Syria, where certain differences in style and coiffure can be observed, even when the Egyptian crown is retained. Several statuary types, generally nude but occasionally draped, are used for representations of the goddess, but one particular type is remarkably common in Egypt. A bronze statuette in the Louvre, acquired in 1852 with a given prov enance "from Lower Egypt" (fig. la-b),4 is probably one of the earliest of the type. The figure is nude with the exception of the vulture's scalp diadem and the feather crown. Her hair is rolled back from a center part and bound in the back of the head in a thick braid, from which the lower section of hair falls loosely. This was an antiquated Greek fashion from the Early Classical Period but still seen, combined eclectically with other styles of curls and braids, on the caryatids from the Erech theion in Athens in the last quarter of the fifth century.5 The braid is also found on a small bronze replica of the Aphrodite type, undoubtedly Ptolemaic, in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.6 It occurs on a free bronze copy of Praxiteles' "Aphrodite of Cnidus" in New York,7 which probably dates to within the last half of the second century b.c.8 Two long, S-curved wavy locks, which hang loosely down to each side of the neck onto the shoulders of the Louvre statuette, have escaped from the thick plait hanging down the woman's back. In her right hand, she holds out a wreath. In her left hand, extended loosely out to the side, she holds an apple, one of her most common attributes.9 The type is repre sented by numerous replicas from Egypt, as Hekler10 demonstrated one century ago. Some replicas hold a mirror in the left hand instead of an apple.11 Variants from Syria often wear a heavy Oriental izing coiffure consisting of two rows of short corkscrew curls across the front of the head and long single ringlets falling down over the shoulders. The most curious aspect of the Louvre statuette is visible only from the back (fig. lb). The sepa rately sculpted vulture cap, which was fitted over the top of the goddess's head, breaks off before the beginning of the bird's tail, exposing her thick braid of hair. After a short segment of braid, the hair 2 Sabine Albersmeier, Frauenstatuen im ptolem?ischen ?gypten (= Aegyptiaca Treverensia 10 [2002]), 54f.

The coquette, loosely open composition of the Louvre statuette, with both its arms bent out at irregular angles and the wrists dangling freely, points to its creation in the Late Hellenistic Period. Such affected poses characterize the representations of countless dancing maenads and archaizing figures of deities on the Neo-Attic reliefs, which begin after mid-second century; the dainty manner of the left hand holding the apple with the tips of the thumb and forefinger is a particularly common gesture in Neo-Attic art.13 The goddess' unabashed display of nudity in an expansive frontal pose speaks for a date in the late second or early first century b.c., as well. The openness and rhythm of the pose, the great interest in the tactile plasticity of the flesh and the texturing of the thick masses of wavy hair place the Louvre bronze on the same stylistic level as a bronze Aphrodite figure in Prov idence,14 for which Marion True15 has brought similar arguments to defend a date of "150-50 b.c." The Cairo replica CG 2765316 is also typically "Alexandrian" in its vibrant plastic modeling of the chubby nude body. The large number of replicas of this type17 attests to its popularity. Another bronze, nude figure of Aphrodite crowned with a vulture cap, auctioned in New York in 2005,18 is represented in the momentary pudica pose more closely following the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles than the above-mentioned small bronze in New York.19 It can be ascribed to the freer variants of the famous type that were increasingly popular in Late Hellenistic times20 and were to be adopted frequently for portrait figures of Roman women.21 The hard modeling of the face with firm, standardized features and the stiff zigzag waves of hair divided by deep incisions point to Roman Period workmanship, although the statuette was undoubtedly made in Egypt. On this statuette, the vulture cap carrying the cow's horn and sun disc diadem has been executed in entirety over the hair on the back of the head. The date of the statuette is presumably toward the middle or into the second half of the first century b.c. The hard, globular face with smooth inner surfaces, symmetric features and full lips, as well as the arrangement of the waves of hair on the shoulders in precise semicircular curls, are strongly Classicizing and are closely comparable to several dancing women on relief slabs from a monument from the Via Praenestina in Rome,22 datable to ca. 50-40 b.c.,23 or a series of relief pan 13 For example, J.

M?bius'28 attribution of the standing figure of Triptolemus in the center of the scene to Marc Antony, supported by the generally accepted Alexandrian ambience of the patera, substantiates his dating of the piece in the 30s B.c., when the Roman triumvir was the consort of Cleopatra VII of Egypt. The bronze "Aphrodite" from the New York art market will also have been created during the reign of Egypt's last?and most notorious?queen. The vulture, equated to the goddess Nechbet of El-Kab in Upper Egypt (Greek, Eileithyiopolis) but also a representative figure of the whole of Upper Egypt opposite the cobra goddess Wadjet of Buto representing Lower Egypt,29 was established since earliest historical times in Egypt as a divine figure closely connected to kingship. A protective goddess of the pharaoh, she appears in the form of a bird hovering over the head of the king30 as an ever present symbol of divine support. The vulture in the form of a diadem is attested sporadically as an insignia of the queen since the Old Kingdom,31 but a closer association of the queen with Nechbet, first manifested on a significant scale in the New King dom, is particularly recognizable in the Ptolemaic Period. In the last three centuries B.c., the vulture cap is found exceedingly often as a headdress for the queen and may have been taken for granted, but it never lost its original meaning as a Pharaonic symbol for the "Lady of Upper Egypt," just as the coiled uraeus serpent worn on the brow of every ruler continued to refer to its very ancient symbol ism as the "Lady of Lower Egypt." An assimilation of the queen to Nechbet appears in the New King dom numerous times in the case of the royal mother (or "queen mother") of the pharaoh;32 this relationship is particularly explicit in scenes of the birth of the pharaoh.33 It is on the basis of this function, including a rather obscure manifestation of Nechbet from Pharaonic times identifying her with the divine midwife, Heket, that the goddess came to be equated by the Greeks to Eileithyia.M This equation corresponded exactly to the traditional character of Eileithyia, the goddess of child birth, who was allegedly present at the birth of Athena, the birth of Dionysus and sometimes of other 24 Athens, National Museum 259, 260: Werner Fuchs, Die Vorbilder der neuattischen Reliefs (Berlin, 1959), 99fF., 172, n. 16, pis. 99, 102, 103; Nikolas Kaltsas, Sculpture in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens: Catalogue, Engl, trans., D.

One Greek tradition reputing Eileithyia to be the mother of Eros37 would justify her appearance in Hellenistic times as the divine mother, Aphrodite.38 A clear historical connection of the Egyptian goddess with a particular queen can be observed at El-Kab, where the remains of a temple of Nechbet existed since remote antiquity.39 There was also built a small rock-hewn sanctuary for the goddess, which was renovated and expanded under Cleo patra III, as she ruled with her husband, Ptolemy Vili Euergetes II, and then as his widow.40 This time period was politically an extremely eventful one in Egypt. Upon the death of Euergetes II in 116 b.c., his own testament bequeathed Cleopatra III her husband's place on the throne of Egypt; she was to choose as her co-regent one of their two sons.41 She first appointed her eldest son, Ptolemy IX Soter II, as co-ruler, an arrangement which lasted from 116 to 107 b.c.; when dynastic squabbles reached a peak, he was expelled and replaced by the younger son, Ptolemy X Alexander I, who ruled on past his mother's death in 101 until 88 b.c.42 It is highly instructive about the co-regencies of these two Ptolemaic kings with their mother that, in official protocols of any nature, whether in Greek or Egyptian, the name and titles of Cleopatra III were always named before theirs, even though tradi tion demanded otherwise that the name of the king be cited first, due to his higher status.43 There was never any doubt that the mother was in charge! The enormously inflated propagandistic mea sures taken by Cleopatra III to secure her popular acceptance as a goddess and the recipient of a state-sponsored cult have left for posterity one of the more colorful epochs in Ptolemaic history.44 It is, then, symptomatic that, in two scenes on the fa?ade of the temple at El-Kab, the queen is represented alone, without a male consort, offering sistrums before the local patron goddess and carrying exceptionally lofty titles of sovereignty equivalent to those of a male Pharaoh: "Horus-Ra, strong bull, the female Horus (Hr.t), mistress of the Two Lands (= Egypt), Cleopatra."45 The decora tion of the speos of the temple is composed of a series of vignettes in which her eldest son, Ptolemy IX Soter II, brings offerings, all standard components of the daily rituals: libations, burnt offerings, wine, milk, victuals, flowers, and the symbol of Ma'at?a gift of appeasement particularly favored by the Ptolemies in the times of political instability of the late second century46?to the goddess.47 The basic legend inscribed in front of each representation of the king, "bringing (x) to his mother," facing opposite a figure of Nechbet, is so pointedly repetitive in the small chapel that it truly gives the impression of a devoted son obliging his parent. In presenting himself repeatedly as the son of Nech bet, the king is virtually equating the vulture goddess with his own, very demanding mother, Cleo 35 LIMC III/l (1986), 685fF.; /2, pis. 534-40, s.v.

Thus Nechbet, the patron goddess of Eileithyiopolis, became a divine parallel to the ruling Queen Cleopatra III on earth. Given the close association of the Alexandrian Aphrodite type in a vulture diadem with the Egyp tian queen, it may be asked whether some of the replicas do actually represent specific Ptolemaic queens. In no case is it obvious, since the goddess wears a Classical Greek coiffure and the faces are idealized to a considerable extent, a common phenomenon on both the Hellenistic and the Egyptian style images of queens of the late Ptolemaic Period.48 The Louvre bronze (fig. la-b) has a round face with prominent, broad-set cheekbones that differs from a typical oval, ideal Aphrodite head, but the variation is not necessarily ground to label the statuette a "portrait." The head does, however, bear a distinct resemblance to a group of monuments and objets d'art that are probably portraits of Cleo patra II, a queen whose long reign (175-115 B.c.) spanned much of the second century.49 That the Louvre bronze could represent Cleopatra II?and not her daughter, Cleopatra III?has no significant bearing on the conclusion that Cleopatra III exploited the Nechbet/Eileithyia iconography to the greatest extent. Some of the most notorious vehicles of religious propaganda of Cleopatra III were already claimed?on a far less flamboyant scale?by earlier queens.50 The association of Ptolemaic queens with Aphrodite is attested with some frequency since the beginning of the dynasty,51 but the state-sponsored introduction of a new eponymous cult in 107 B.c. of "Cleopatra Aphrodite" appears to have had a lasting significance. In that year, a new priest (Gr. hiereus, Eg., w%) was installed, serving "the Queen Cleopatra, the goddess Aphrodite, the mother loving" (Gr. basilisse Kleop?tra thea Aphrodite he kai Philometor); in Egyptian, "Aphrodite" was trans lated "the goddess (ti ntr.t, or simply ti) Hathor."52 Both the Egyptian and Greek versions refrain from equating the queen with the goddess outright; the name "Aphrodite" or "Hathor" is qualified each time by "the goddess," which in the case of established deities would have been superfluous and here reveals a touch of self-consciousness. The queen's common assimilation of Nechbet to other divine "daughters of Ra," especially Hathor and Tefnut, is clearly illustrated by the decoration of the El-Kab temple during her reign.53 In the Middle Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus, a "Street of Cleopatra Aphrodite" (agyia Kleopatras Aphrodites) is mentioned at least as early as 73 B.c., but probably beginning with the association of Cleopatra III with Aphrodite-Hathor in 107 B.C.,54 and is still cited as late as 44 B.c. (i.e., in the reign of Cleopatra VII),55 thus spanning the regnal periods of several Cleopatrae. Whether Aphrodite's link to the "queen Cleopatra," as implied in the street name, continued to be associated with the same historical queen, or was automatically associated with the contemporary queen of that name is not known. In the third century A.D., a cult of "Aphrodite Cleopatra" is attested in Memphis.56 Undoubt edly this goddess is a late echo of the Ptolemaic cult of a Queen Cleopatra Aphrodite, probably the cult that was initiated towards the end of the reign of Cleopatra III in 107/6 B.c.57 The name of the 48 As commented on by Helmut Kyrieleis, Bildnisse der Ptolem?er.

The coiffure and crown clearly resem ble the adornment of a Ptolemaic queen, wearing the familiar vulture cap, but the frequency of such statuettes from Hellenistic and Roman Syria?and even from mainland Greece63?leads to the ques tion what these pieces would have signified outside of Egypt. From the time that Cleopatra I Syra ("the Syrian"), a daughter of Antiochus III, married Ptolemy V in 194/3 B.c.,64 the Ptolemaic and the Seleucid royal families became in-laws and cousins and, despite intermittent military clashes, intermarriages arranged between the two houses became a more fre quent effort to establish positive relations.65 The most prominent Egyptian export of the second cen tury was Cleopatra Thea, the eldest daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, who was sent to Syria to marry the Seleucid king, Alexander Balas, in 150 B.c. After his death, she remained in the king dom to marry Demetrius II (146) and later Antiochus VII Sidetes (138-129).66 Unlike her sister on the throne of Egypt, Cleopatra Thea as Queen of Syria was not entitled to a significant political role in the ruling of the country,6' but as a figurehead she enjoyed an exceptional status as one of the only Seleucid queens to be represented with her portrait on coins; there her bust appeared beside that of her husband, Alexander Balas.68 After the death of her third husband, for a short time (126/5 B.c.) she held the throne alone, at which time coins were issued with her portrait on the obverse, and on the reverse a borrowed Ptolemaic symbol?the double cornucopia (fig. 3a-b).69 By late 125, she had b2 The author has not rechecked this detail on the original. 63 See infra and fig. 4a-b. 64 Whitehorne, Cleopatras, 80ff. 63 C.

(Cleopatra) Tryphaena, a daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III, was sent in 124/3 by her father to marry her cousin, Antiochus VIII Grypus, whom she then bore five sons and a daughter.71 In 106, back in Egypt, her younger sister, Cleopatra Selene, after being discarded by her brother and hus band, Ptolemy IX Soter II (doubtless at the bidding of their domineering mother), went to Antioch to marry, consecutively, three Seleucid kings.72 The Louvre bronze statuette (fig. 2a-b) shows certain individualized traits that suggest it reflects the image of a queen. The heavy pile of long ringlets, embellished with a double tier of shorter cork screw curls over the forehead, is precisely the coiffure that is seen on coin portraits of Cleopatra Thea (fig. 3a).73 Adequate comparison with other queens is lacking, as she was one of the only Seleucid women to have been represented on coins. The fleshy, rounded face of the Louvre "Aphrodite" is sculpted in large, clearly defined planes. Large, round eyes communicate an intensely focused expres sion due to the sharply undercut lower border of the upper eyelids and the diagonally sloped brows (unlike the flat lying, saucer-round and rigidly staring eyes of Ptolemaic royal portraits), and the pupils are pierced. The nose is short and thick, and slightly arched. The small mouth has full, fleshy lips, the upper lip curved in a dainty "cupid's bow," accentuated by a deeply recessed philtrum. The rendering of all of these traits is strongly reminiscent of the glyptic style found on Seleucid coins of the second century./4 For example, the large, dominant eye is common on the coin portraits of numerous Seleu cids of the later second and early first centuries.75 It is expressively shadowed by a deeply recessed diagonal band beneath the eyebrow and substantial shadowing beneath the lower lid and in a hollow between the eye and the nose, the pupil is decisively indicated, and the outer corner of the eye is still quite angular, in contrast to the distended, round "Ptolemaic eyes." In contrast to the often harm lessly (not to say "stupidly") smiling, additively applied mouth seen on portraits of Ptolemies, the lips of the Seleucid rulers on their coin portraits are plastically and firmly embedded in the surrounding flesh, evoking an emphatic and determined, sometimes dark expression. The wide-eyed gaze of the "Syrian" bronze Aphrodite, combined with the nervous pose of the nude goddess, evokes an expres sion of anxiety. Kyrieleis76 has explained this difference in official image from the serene and immo bile, iconic coin images of the Ptolemaic rulers as a necessity of a royal family ruling over such diverse territories as Iran, Syria, Babylonia, and parts of Asia Minor. He argued that a powerful and deter mined pictorial image of the king was designed to make a strong impression on peoples who were culturally not united.77 In Egypt, of course, the opposite held true; it was assumed by the Egyptian populace that their country was there for eternity.

The evidence for precisely identifying images of the Seleucid queens is extremely sparse,80 and our inadequate current understanding of Syrian bronzes makes it difficult to exclude that the figure could be Roman. Nevertheless, Cleopatra Thea was the only Seleucid queen of the second century to have achieved prominence on coins, and is thus far the most likely candidate for the attribution of the Louvre bronze, even though the characteristic upturned nose on that queen's coin portraits differs from the image on the statuette. That detail is also not consistently rendered on coins.81 The Louvre bronze statuette is far less likely to represent that queen's niece, Cleopatra Tryphaena, who some years later married Antiochus VIII Grypus;82 she is far more obscure in extant documentation and thus far nowhere visible in art. Cleopatra Selene is at least tentatively identifiable from portraits from Egypt and does not appear to have ever been so plump as the portrait head suggests.83 Never theless, since every Seleucid king from 150 B.c. on married a Ptolemaic princess or a discarded Ptole maic queen, the chances remain hopeful of eventually identifying them by comparison with the more plentiful Egyptian material. That the inherently Egyptian coiffure and headdress were adopted for the Syrian version of the "Cleopatra Aphrodite" type recognized the blood ties between the two royal houses via the export of princesses from Alexandria, but also attached itself in its foreign context to the Oriental roots of Aphrodite's cult and her early assimilation to Astarte.84 Aphrodite's Phoenician precursor, herself a goddess of beauty and eroticism, was frequently represented nude85?long before the Greek goddess was presented so by Praxiteles. The fashioning of a headdress out of the bird's scalp recalls a typical Egyptian diadem and was obviously borrowed by the Greeks of Syria. The bird closely associated with Aphrodite was the dove.86 The species of bird is often not clearly recognizable on the headdress. Hekler87 argued that 78 Thus one may argue, elaborating on B. Andreae's recent suggestion (RM 111 [2004], 69ff., esp. 78) that the "Alexander mosaic" from Casa del Fauno in Pompeii was copied after an original painting that was made in Antiocheia, that the head of Alexander the Great on that pavement bears a fiery facial expression familiar from Seleucid coins. The huge, wide-open and glaring eye with a jagged eyebrow is not, however, rendered in the style of the early third century, when the original painting of the battle scene was made; rather it can be compared to Seleucid glyptic ruler portraits of the later second century b.c., when the mosaic was laid in Pompeii. The mosaicist evidently worked after a copy of the original painting sketched at that time by an artist under the influence of Seleucid court style. 79 El-Kab, 12ff. 80 Fleischer, Studien, 127f. 81 Cf.

In his study on portraits of Seleucid rulers, Fleischer (Studien, 126, pl. 57?z) cites as the last Syrian coins of the capita jugata type an issue with the busts of Cleopatra Selene as Queen of Syria and her son, Antio chus XIII. The portrait features of the queen, who on these issues would be in her later years, are unfortunately barely discern able on known examples and it is almost impossible to make any portrait assessment from them. Certain individualized traits that seem to be represented?long cheeks, a short, straight nose and a large chin that appears to jut forward?might possibly be compared with the portrait in Alexandria (Grimm, loc. cit.) that has been tentatively attributed to Cleopatra Selene. 84 Roscher, Lexikon I, cols. 650-55 (E.

In the case of the first Louvre bronze (fig. la-b), the wings of the vulture lie compactly against the head in the manner of an Egyptian diadem. On the headdress of the second Louvre bronze (fig. 2a-b), the wings are ruffled or slightly outspread. One might conjec ture the bird is about to hatch an egg or, perhaps, that she is protecting her brood. Although the lat ter statuette is from Syria, the same bird with "ruffled feathers" occurs on numerous examples from Egypt as well,88 so it must be considered a Hellenistic variant rather than a Syrian interpretation. The neck of the bird is thick with softly incised lateral, S-curved striations which appear to indicate the fuller collar of feathers seen on a vulture but not on a dove. It is still possible that the attribute tacitly received a new interpretation in the Seleucid Empire, although a precise explanation may not have seemed necessary. Such had been the case with the motif of the double cornucopia, which was bor rowed from Ptolemaic glyptic art for Seleucid coins (fig. 3b),89 but did not include in its Syrian usage the original implication of an incestuous family bond. Whether based on an earlier myth or a late Roman tautology, a reinterpretation of the exotic Aphrodite type is reflected in a legend related by Nigidius Figulus90 that "the fish found a large egg in the Euphrates, and they pushed it to the shore, where it was hatched by a dove. Thus the Syrian Venus was born?a good and kind goddess, to whom mankind is indebted for many good deeds." It is thus possible that, outside of the sphere of Egyptian theology, the figure with the bird's scalp headdress was interpreted as Aphrodite, born of a dove, and like a dove, a charitable and benevolent woman?precisely those qualities that were valued in several Hellenistic queens who were revered as "Aphrodite" (see infra). A close physical resemblance of the Louvre bronze to a woman portrayed on at least one, or even several, of the clay seals found at Edfu91 is worthy of note in that it probably represents one of the Ptolemaic royal women, yet unidentified, who married into the Seleucid royal house. The broad dia dem worn over the coiffure of corkscrew curls of one of the portrait types,92 adorned with a lotus bud ornament, appears to identify the woman as a member of the Ptolemaic royal family, and the flat, simplified glyptic style with the large, wide-open and rigidly gazing "Ptolemaic eye" clearly repro duces the work of a gem cutter of the Alexandrian court.93 On the other hand, a seal image repre senting perhaps the same queen in a vulture's scalp headdress surmounted by a horned sun disc94 is rendered in a heavy-handed style with large, thick features and a dense clutter of details that appear to avoid the calm, empty spaces preferred in Egyptian art; the frontal representation of both breasts, which appear to be naked but may, in fact, have been covered by a thin sheath, and three rows of beaded jewelry make an optically jarring impression. The style of glyptic art may, in fact, come from Phoenicia where, in Classical times and earlier, relief and three-dimensional sculptural style was often marked by round, bulging eyes with thick rims, large features crowded into compressed head shapes, 88 Among numerous examples are: Cairo, CG 27652 (C.

Just as for the Greek Aphrodite, however, the bird sacred to the cult of Astarte was the dove.101 Despite some possible different nuances in interpretation, it can not have been exceptional for Syrian variants of the nude Aphrodite to wear, along with an Orientalizing coiffure of corkscrew curls, a composite, horned sun-disc crown that was originally Egyptian but meanwhile long since fa miliar on representations of her equivalent, Astarte. An association of numerous Hellenistic queens with Aphrodite is attested, sometimes evidently based on their generous public service, although the main role of the spouse of a Hellenistic king was almost always as an heir producer. Phila, the widow of the Macedonian leader Craterus who later became the wife of Demetrius Poliorcetes, financed of her own accord dowries for "the sisters and the daughters of the poor" as well as other charitable initiatives for those without means.102 Her exem plary domestic role as the caring wife is illustrated again by an anecdote cited by Diodorus (who tends to write of Phila in glowing terms)103 that she had once sent the proper royal clothing to her husband, Demetrius Poliorcetes, while he was at the battlefront. Athenaeus relates that the queen was toasted at a festive symposion in godlike terms as Aphrodite Phila,104 but he puts down a civic cult established in honor of Phila Aphrodite and the erection of a sanctuary?the Philaion?already during her lifetime as the work of "flatterers" (ton de Demetriou ton hastieos k?l?kon).105 The Seleucid queen Laodice, wife of Antiochus III, sponsored the financing of dowries for needy young women of Iasus 95 E.g., A.

Her stepson, the prince and later coregent Antiochus, fell?in the judgment of the court physician?dangerously lovesick for her. Another fer vently amorous youth at court, Kombabos, later castrated himself as a gesture of his devotion to the queen, following a custom of cult personnel in the service of Atargatis.112 It was said that Stratonice was commanded by the goddess Atargatis (the Syrian As tarte, although maintained by Luc?an to be the equivalent of Hera rather than Aphrodite) in a dream to build a temple to her; this appears to have been true, as this was the temple that still stood in the Holy City (Hierapolis) in Syria in Lucian's day (2nd century A.D.). Because of his self-imposed emasculation, Kombabos knew he could accom pany the queen to the Holy City to supervise the building of the temple without the danger of being tempted into a sinful act of adultery. Thus its construction must have proceeded according to the utmost wishes of the Syrian Goddess. Luc?an concludes his tale by stating that loyal friends of Kumbabos thereupon castrated themselves in emulation of him, resulting in the origin of the Galloi. From the fourth century B.c. on, Aphrodite became increasingly the goddess most closely associ ated with marriage and with wifely virtues, replacing Hera, in popular cult.m Hera, the true queen among the Olympians, had a reputation as jealous and manipulative, and threatening to the male self-esteem?a nature far too intimidating for popular appeal. Wiltrud Neumer-Pfau114 observed that the development of romantic plots in New Comedy and of the theme of romantic love in Hellenistic poetry reveals the shift in popular sentiment. Associations with the goddess of love and beauty can only have been flattering to any wife and the ultimate appeal to the feminine pride of a queen.115 The court poetry of Callimachus paints a romantic picture of the young bride, Berenice II, and the role of enormous political responsibility into which she was thrust in the first year of her marriage.116 The ocritus, in his Hymn to Ptolemy, portrays Berenice I, the wife of Ptolemy I who bore the heir to the dynasty, as a loving wife under the auspices of Aphrodite, the "Queen of Cyprus."117 It would not have been insulting to the queens that famous courtesans were also acclaimed as "Aphrodite,"118 but an intelligent queen's ability to use her feminine wiles to influence the king to make wise political decisions certainly also contributed to her being revered.119 The emphasis of the religious propa 100 S.

From Egypt in 135 b.c., there is mention of an inheritance tax that was to be paid to "the Goddess Berenice" (theai Berenikei),121 which at that time can only have referred to a deified queen, either Berenice I, the wife of Ptolemy I Soter, about whom little is known,122 or Berenice II, the Queen of Cyrene who married Ptolemy III Euergetes in 246 b.c. The fact that the latter queen brought with her to Egypt, quasi as "dowry," hegemony over the neighboring Libyan ter ritory123 was perhaps the origin of her figurative involvement with inheritances, but the interest of the Crown in imposing the tax may well have been purely fiscal. The legal arrangement regarding a tax on heirs must have survived in some limited form, since an inheritance tax from Roman Egypt is recorded that was paid into the cult of Berenice Euergetis.124 The significance of the Roman document is twofold; not only does it inform us that this goddess "Berenice" was indeed Berenice II, who, alongside her husband, carried the byname "Euergetis" but also that the deified Ptolemaic queen was still the recipient of a cult in Roman times. Evidence for Berenice II as a patron goddess of brides or of family law is otherwise lacking, although her glorification as a "royal bride" by the court poet Callimachus125 and an artistic presentation of her royal image as maternal or even matronly has been observed in her own lifetime.126 Her divine assimilation to "Isis, Mother of Gods" (Isis meter theon) is attested during her reign.127 The cult title was to be revived in the second century in grand style by the very pompous Cleopatra III, herself also carrying the epithet Euergetis, "the Benefactress."128 As it is only in 135 b.c., according to our sparse sources, that the "Goddess Berenice" is recorded to have received the payment of inheritance tax,129 it is possible that the tax was first implemented by Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II, to be directed into a cult of the deified third century queen. The maternal Egyptian Aphrodite type for Ptolemaic queens is supplemented by an interesting bronze Aphrodite statuette from Lower Egypt, now in the Cairo Museum, which, however, wears a Stephane rather than the Egyptian vulture's scalp headdress.130 The tiny, pinched features of the face, the rather jagged movements of the limbs and the densely packed, thin, rippling, vertical folds of the drapery over the legs and feet point most probably to a dating of the bronze in the Late Hellenistic Period, as L. Kirwan conjectured in the original publication of the piece. The contour of the goddess's mantle, which she holds up behind her right shoulder, is stylized in the form of a large wing; the man tle thus appears to have taken on the protective function of a large shield.131 In Greek iconography, 120 Cf.

The protective aspect of the Cairo Aphrodite statuette corresponded particularly closely to the role of the Egyptian queen as a royal mother,134 analogous to the parallel roles of Nechbet and Cleopatra III in the Temple at Elkab. In the transmission of this type of queen/goddess to a Roman public, the most famous "Cleopatra" of them all cannot be left out of the equation. In 46 B.c., in the Temple of Venus Genetrix on the Cam pus Martius in Rome, Julius Caesar erected a gold (or gilded) statue of Cleopatra VII in divine form near the statue of the goddess herself.135 Speculations about that particular statue of the Egyptian queen have been the subject of a recent exhibition in Hamburg, Germany;136 a theory of Bernard Andreae would identify the marble Venus of the Esquiline, an eclectic nude Venus standing beside a large vase encircled by a cobra and a box of rose petals, as that image of Cleopatra VII. This sugges tion has not gone undisputed137 and no doubt will be the subject of much further debate. In any case, the original monument of Julius Caesar's exotic royal lover was not removed after the fall of Egypt to Rome; it was there for Appian to describe it,138 and still in the early third century A.D., Cassius Dio139 commented on the permanent tribute to the Egyptian queen standing next to the cult statue of Venus Genetrix.140 The above-mentioned bronze statuette of Aphrodite/Venus, recently offered on the New York art market, represented in a pudica type but wearing a vulture's scalp,141 is an idealized image of the goddess of love appearing as the Queen of Egypt herself, probably made during the reign of Cleopatra VII. Marleen Flory has demonstrated142 that Octavian waged a program of counterpropaganda against Cleopatra in 35 B.c. by awarding his sister, Octavia, and his wife, Livia, public honorific statues along with the freedom from tutela (financial control by a guardian) and sacrosanctity.143 These privileges accorded them an exceptionally high status among Roman elite women. Flory144 concluded that the timing of this grant, probably enabled through senatorial majority vote, was above all intended to elevate Octavia's dignity in Roman eyes at a time when her husband, Marc Antony, had strayed off, engaged in an affair with the Queen of Egypt, established a family with her and an alliance against 132 Werbrouck, "D?esse Nekhbet," 127ff. 133 Werbrouck, "D?esse Nekhbet," 197; Capart, "Quelques observations," If., on Nechbet's common epithet iwt(.t), "with arms (i.e., "wings") outstretched." 134 Werbrouck, "D?esse Nekhbet," 198, 200. 135 App., bellciv. 2.102; Dio 51.22.5; cf.

The public images of Octavia and Livia were almost certainly discreetly clothed as Roman matrons, the epitome of staunch morals, wifely virtues and propriety. The goddess Venus Genetrix, a matriarchal figure, was not represented nude but rather clothed in a long, clinging chiton; the famous statue was said by Pliny (NH 35.155) to have been copied after a late fifth century b.c. work by Kallimachos, generally recognized in the type of the "Aphrodite Frejus."145 Repetitions were obviously not that strict, however, since Roman coins carrying a legend VENERI GENETRICI repro duce various Aphrodite types.146 On a fragmentary green turquoise cameo in Boston,147 a high relief bust of the Empress Livia sub specie Veneri Genetrici is portrayed with a smaller-scale bust of her "adop tive" son, Tiberius, both crowned with laurel wreaths. Livia is shown as the divine matriarch of the Gens Iulia, transmitting the continuity of the line to Augustus' successor by means of the adoption. The "Venus Genetrix" type, with its conservative and matronal image of propriety, was reserved in Julio-Claudian times for images of the Empress148 but was to become popular in the late first and second centuries a.d. for the funerary representation of Roman wives in a private sphere, as well.149 A fine bronze of a woman from Paramythia in the British Museum (fig. 4a-b), 150 clad in a long, clinging chiton and a mantle draped around her hips, and crowned with a bird's scalp headdress, was described by Walters151 as Aphrodite's mother, Dione?an interesting identification which has not, however, gained acceptance.152 The maternal Aphrodite type appropriate for viewers of the Roman world probably would have reminded them of the Venus Genetrix, which was similar, if not identical, in appearance.153 The vulture?or dove?cap worn on the bronze statuette, allegedly found in Paramythia in Eretria, is also not likely to have reminded the Western viewer of the Egyptian royal mother goddess, Nechbet; that deity appears to have been quite obscure in the Greek and Latin sources. Nevertheless, the substantial number of "Egyptianizing" and "Orientalizing" works of art from the Hellenistic and Roman Periods from Egypt and abroad shows that the vulture diadem was widely known as the attribute of an Egyptian queen or Isis. 1d4 Hence the appellative "Aphrodite Cleo patra," although sparsely attested155 and possibly rarely ever used in this specific form, is an apt char acterization of the Aphrodite types wearing that Egyptian headdress. 145 Bieber, Ancient Copies, 45ff., 93, 110, 176, figs. 124-49; A Passion for Antiquities.

A similar treatment of drapery and body forms occurs on the figures in high relief on the silver "Tiberius cup" from Boscoreale in the Louvre.156 Certain peculiarities in the rendering of the head of the Paramythia bronze?the long, thin and rather delicate face with high cheekbones, narrow eyes, a short nose and, especially, the tiny, but full-lipped mouth, of which the outer corners are pulled in tightly, distinctly resemble portraits of the beloved sister of the Emperor Caligula, Drusilla.157 Sculp tural portraits of Drusilla are datable by a typically Caligul?n hairstyle of tightly crimped and some what flattened waves emerging from a center part and framing the face, frequently embellished by a row of tiny snail-shell curls along the hairline, then bound into a large loop hanging down the back of the neck like a ponytail.158 Her images can be differentiated from those of her sister, Agrippina minor, in that she died at a mere 22 years old, so that all of her portraits represent her as a young woman.159 Unlike her sisters, she was elevated by Caligula to the status of a goddess, which was prob ably the reason why she was the only one of them to be represented wearing a crescent diadem, as she appears several times.160 She is represented in the Kore Albani type in a statue from the Theater at Caere,161 and a portrait head of her was discovered in a Temple of Kore at Cyrene.162 A marble portrait bust of the posthumously deified Drusilla in Munich (fig. 5),103 crowned with a Stephane, is similar to the London bronze statuette in its appropriate characterization of the youth of the Em peror's sister. Due to the Venus Genetrix type, the coiffure of the bronze statuette has been assimilated to the Late Classical/Hellenistic coiffure of Aphrodite, the crimped waves of the modish Roman coif fure having been replaced by crinkly, loose waves, which are then drawn to the nape of the neck and bound up in a similar little loop as is seen on Drusilla's portrait statue from Caere.164 Long, wavy strands of hair that escape from this arrangement and fall loosely onto the shoulders of the bronze statuette from the Greek mainland are a Hellenic adaptation of the long, loose locks that fall behind the ears of Drusilla's Roman coiffure on several replicas?or perhaps they revert to a true Hellenistic prototype.165 Unlike the contemporary Roman fashion, the ears on the Paramythia "Drusilla/Venus" are not exposed. 150 Fran?ois Baratte, Le tr?sor d'orf?vrerie romaine de Boscoreale (Paris, 1986), 69fF., figs. 72ff.; Frederike Fless, Opferdiener und Kultmusiker auf stadtr?mischen historischen Reliefs (Mainz, 1995), 24, 55, 71, 73, pl. 61.1. 157 Cf.

The bond between Caligula and his sister, Drusilla, was extremely close, but whether the statements by Suetonius166 that the Emperor regarded her as a wife (in modum iustae uxoris propalam), and to the same effect by Cassius Dio,167 literally meant that they had an in cestuous relationship has?in modern scholar ship as in the public gossip of antiquity?been the subject of some speculation.168 In inscrip tions she was named "sister" (adelphe) of the Emperor Caligula and "daughter" (thygater) of his father and predecessor, Germanicus. The honors Caligula bestowed upon Drusilla were exceptional and unprecedented in Roman politics and cult. He bequeathed to her in his will his entire empire;169 then, after her early death, he had her declared a "universal" goddess, Diva Drusilla Panthea.l/0 She was to be honored in all cities of the Empire.1/1 Games were to be held annually on occasion of her birthday, she was to receive a sanctuary and a staff of priests, and statues of her were set up in Rome in the Curia and in the Temple of. Venus Genetrix, as had been the gold statue of Cleopatra VII by Julius Caesar.1 /2 Oaths were henceforth to be sworn by the numen Drusillae.173 In Cyzikus she was equated to Aphrodite, and inscriptions from Athens and Asia Minor call her EA A , the "New Aphrodite."174 166 Calig. 24.1. 167 59.3.3. 168 Sec infra and n. 200. 169 Suet., Calig. 24.1-2. 170 Suet., Calig. 24.2; Dio 59.11.Iff.; cf.

Susan Wood, Imperial Women, 212f., assumes that the inscriptions dated to Drusilla's lifetime, the deification prematurely elevating her to a divine status that had until then only been accorded imperial women who had already given birth to an heir and successor to the throne; cf. Charles B. Rose, Dynastic Commemoration and Imperial Portraiture (Cambridge, 1997), 13, 25. As Drusilla died childless at a young age, the installation of her cult and erection of a cult statue in Rome post humously would, according to this reconstruction, have covered up the embarrassment of having prematurely declared her an incarnation of Venus and the Genetrix of the subsequent Julian line (Wood, Imperial Wo?nen, 213). 172 For a headless torso from Otricoli, possibly representing Drusilla as Venus Genetrix, see Gianna Dareggi, "Il ciclo statu ario della 'Basilica' di Otricoli: la fase Giulio-Claudia," BdA 67 ser. 6 (1982), 1-36, esp. 21f., n. 5, figs. 32-33; W7ood, Imperiai Women, 244, with . 109. 173 Barrett, Caligula, 87. 1/4 Hahn, Frauen des r?mischen Kaiserhauses, 152, 154ff., 158f.</page><page sequence="21">CHESHIRE 171 The only actual historical reference to Drusilla's cult in Egypt is, perhaps, the renaming of the second month of summer, the Egyptian Payni, to "Drusilleios" in 38, a change that was rescinded soon after Caligula's death in 41.175 Still, a definite effort by Caligula to present her posthumously as a god dess on Egyptian terms has been inferred through sporadic archaeological evidence. According to a theory of J.-C. Grenier,176 a colossal pink granite statue in pharaonic style of an Egyptian queen,177 imported in antiquity from Egypt to Rome along with a pair of strikingly similar statues of Arsinoe II and Ptolemy II,178 was a Roman copy made after the earlier Arsinoe statue, with the intention of forming a group monument. The third statue would, according to Grenier, have represented Caligula's sister, Drusilla, who, honored as Diva Drusilla Panthea after her death, was still portrayed alongside her two living sisters.179 Sabine Albersmeier180 has supported his thesis that the third statue is a Roman copy; the use of several blocks of granite joined together rather than one colossal block, the high degree of polishing and the more summary rendering of some details set the second "queen" statue apart and reveal the imitative style of an Imperial Period copyist. In explanation of the find context of the three statues, Grenier considered it significant that, together with these "matched" pieces found in the Gardens of Sallust, was also discovered a Nineteenth Dynasty Egyptian statue of Queen Touiya, the revered mother of Ramses II.181 The statue provides an interesting illustration of the assimilation of the "Queen Mother" of the Pharaoh to Nechbet in that finely incised lines fanning out from the face over the heavy wig represent the wings of the vulture, fusing her own being with that of the queen.182 In intentionally erecting in Rome a statue of the royal mother of perhaps the most illustrious pharaoh of Egypt's long history, "Ramses the Great," Caligula was underlining his own matrilineal descent from the royal house of the Ptolemies. As a seven-year-old in a.d. 18/19, Caligula is known to have accompanied his father, Germanicus, along with his mother, Agrippina, and newborn sister, Julia Livilla, on a mission to the Orient.183 Whether the family members were also present on the prince's excursion through Egypt?a sponta neous side trip outside of his own imp?rium consulare that incurred the displeasure of the Emperor Tiberius?is not known.184 Nevertheless, Caligula's own fascination with Egypt may well have been kindled through his participation on this trip, on which he doubtless heard a good deal about his own ancestral connections, through his great-grandfather Marc Antony, with the Ptolemaic dynasty. Diodorus wrote in his time (mid-first century b.c.) a description of the Ramesseum in Thebes that included three black (granite) statues of the mother of "Osymandias" (Ramses II),185 whom we know 175 Barrett, Caligula, 88, 275, . 69. 176 "Notes Isiaques, 1.5," BMonMusPont 9,1 (1989), 2Iff. 177 Vatican, Museo Gregoriano Egizio 22683.

Grenier186 has supposed that one of these could have been the statue that was eventually transported to Rome and discovered with the other pieces in the Gardens of Sallust. On Germanicus' visit south to Thebes, it is recorded by Tacitus187 that an Egyptian priest translated for the party of Romans the inscriptions on the walls of the Karnak temple describing the military heroics of Ramses (the Great). Thus it is thoroughly credible that Germanicus?or even Caligula?amassed a certain under standing of the pharaonic monuments and their references to historical events. Judging by the reports of the ancient historiographers and the monuments known to have been transported to Rome, the Great Ramses and his achievements appear to have been of particular interest to Roman tourists. Hence, the transportation of the statue of Touiya, Ramses' mother, to Rome was an obvious choice for a "souvenir" in the Julio-Claudian Period. Even the iconographical significance of the etched feathers of the vulture's wings on Touiya's wig could have been explained by a knowledgeable tour guide. Hence the Egyptian symbolism of the vulture's scalp diadem on Drusilla's statuettes from Paramythia (fig. 4a-b) and (possibly) Egypt (see infra) for a royal matriarch, comparable to Venus Genetrix, must have been familiar to Caligula. After his father suddenly fell ill and died in Syria later that year, and his mother Agrippina and his brothers were banished by Tiberius soon thereafter,188 the boy Caligula spent a good deal of time together with his sisters at the home of their grandmother, Antonia the Younger.189 Antonia, then considerably advanced in years, was the daughter of Marc Antony and his first wife, Augustus' sister, Octavia. Through Marc Antony's subsequent union with Cleopatra VII, Antonia had become the half sister of that couple's three children?the bloodline heirs to the Ptolemaic Dynasty?including Queen Cleopatra Selene of Mauretania. Cassius Dio190 writes vaguely about an Egyptian heirloom or inheri tance once in Marc Antony's possession that Caligula put up for auction in A.D. 39.191 The young Caligula's contacts in the home of his grandmother with princes of deposed kingdoms of the East led him, soon after becoming Emperor, to follow the precedent of Marc Antony in a magnanimous, pro Orient policy.192 According to Philo,193 Caligula wanted to be regarded in the manner of a Hellenis tic monarch as Soter, Euergetes, and Epiphanes.194 He thus began his rule with a typically Ptolemaic proclamation of amnestia and philanthropia for prisoners, exiles and other victims of the legal process of Tiberius.195 The historical, propagandistic and iconographical innovations set by the startling pre cedent of the marriage of Ptolemy II to his sister, Arsinoe II, the "Sibling Gods" (Theoi Adelphoi), were still well known to the Romans, and such motifs as the double cornucopia, jugate portrait busts and interwoven male-female attributes were adapted, at least in the sense of symbolism for tight fam ily bonds, for the iconography of Republican Roman and Julio-Claudian official art forms.196 Although the marriage of Arsinoe II with her brother produced no offspring, and the succession to the throne in Alexandria went in actual fact through Ptolemy III, Philadelphus' son from his previ 18(&gt; "Notes isiaques," 30, with n. 48. 18/ Ann., 2.60; cf.

The term "Brother-Loving" was perhaps not used because the Emperor realized that the allusion to incest was dangerous for his public image.

It is, then, not sur prising that the reports of Caligula's "incestuous union" with Drusilla stem from the time while the siblings lived together with their grandmother, Antonia.200 Presumably since childhood, Caligula was familiar with images of his remote ancestress, Arsinoe Philadelphus, through her commemorative coin issues, minted through the entire Ptolemaic Period,201 or from the large number of posthumous monuments to her cult.202 Such a portrait might have been included among the "Egyptian heirlooms" from Marc Antony's former possession that, according to Cassius Dio,203 Caligula put up for auction in A.D. 39.204 Caligula might even have noticed a certain resemblance of those antique portraits to his own sister, Drusilla. The delicate features of her bust in Munich (fig. 5) or the face of the London bronze (fig. 4a), for example, show basically a similar facial type to the narrow, frail visage, the slender, pointed nose, the thin, curled lips of Arsinoe II on her portraits in Istanbul205 and Mariemont,206 or to a lesser extent on a later replica at Kingston Lacy.207 All three of these posthumous images of the deified Arsinoe wear the Stephane, or crescent diadem, which also adorned several of Drusilla's portraits. The significance of the red granite statue pair of the "Sibling Gods," Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, and the creation of a twin statue to Arsinoe's, possibly representing his sister, Drusilla, in his own time may well have been an impression developing in Caligula's mind most of his life long, enhanced by the coincidental physical resemblance between the two adult women. Perhaps more important, the young Caligula will have heard of the spiritual ties holding Ptolemy II together with his sister even after her death. This was, centuries before in Egypt, the unique status of Arsinoe Philadelphus who, as a deceased queen declared a goddess, continued to function as a source of guidance and support for her brother-husband while he was still alive on earth and reigning 197 RE 32/2 (1959), cols. 1667f. s.v.

The three standing, draped figures are almost identical, and the group is undoubtedly to be interpreted collectively, as an indivisible triad, together with Caligula a close-knit Imperial family.211 Each woman carries a cornucopia, symbolizing the natural bounty or wealth of the Roman Empire, and wears an identical Greek costume of a chiton covered by a low-slung mantle. The figure on the left, labeled "Agrippina," is leaning against a pillar, the symbol of Securitas, while she extends her left hand towards her sister, Drusilla, or in the direction of both of her sisters. The assimilation of Drusilla to Concordia is attested elsewhere in its Greek form, Homonoia, on the island of Cos and in one inscription in Asia.212 In the middle of the coin image and represented slightly larger than the other two women, she holds out a patera in her right hand either towards Agrippina or toward her worshipers in general, welcoming them to offer a libation. The figure is typologically reminiscent of the appliqu? of a queen, holding a cornucopia, on the Ptolemaic faience oinochoai, beginning with 208 Serge Sauneron, "Un document ?gyptien relativ ? la divinization de la reine Arsino?

The image recalls the atmosphere of love and harmony that pervaded the family life of Germanicus and his wife, Agrippina the Elder, together with all their children.214 The picture of the happy family had been used by Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder as an instrument of propaganda to great effect during the reign of Tiberius, win ning over popular sentiment towards the once designated heir to Augustus' empire?in tacit prefer ence to the contemporary rule of Tiberius.215 Precursors to the allegorical figures representing Caligula's sisters occur singly on female allegori cal figures on Late Hellenistic gem carvings.216 An intaglio from Tortosa, the ancient port Antaradus on the Syrian coast, in Oxford217 is identifiable through the double cornucopia held by the female fig ure as Fortuna.218 Vollen weider219 dated a strikingly similar gem in Paris to the early first century B.c. and suggested it represented a Ptolemaic queen.220 Stylistically, nothing prevents the glyptic images from dating as early as the late second century B.c., so that they fall into the epoch when numerous women of the Ptolemaic royal family were being married into the Seleucid royal house.221 The two horns of plenty on the "Fortuna" gem carving are bound together by a ribbon, perhaps a royal dia dem such as that on the signature motif of Arsinoe Philadelphus and the Ptolemaic Theoi Adelphoi.222 The Paris intaglio, of which the present setting was perhaps an addition of a later period,223 could origi nally have been a keepsake of one supporter of the Ptolemaic or Seleucid court or decorated the ring of a priestess or devotee of the ruler cult. In this context, the cornucopia, coupled with Drusilla's gesture on the sestertii of holding her left hand out to touch Agrippina's shoulder, are doubtless symbolic for the sibling bond (which the three women incidentally also shared with Caligula), adapting a motif from Ptolemaic royal iconography. The suspicion raised by some of Caligula's contemporaries that he had had incestuous relationships with all three sisters224 would have meant that he had revived a notorious practice of the Ptolemaic royal family quite literally. 213 Dorothy Burr Thompson, Ptolemaic Oinochoai and Portraits in Faience (Oxford, 1973), 23ff., 74; Erika Simon, GGA 227, 3/4 (1975), 212f.

K?berlein, Caligula, 27f., connected the attributes of the three women with the goddess Isis, but Hellenistic parallels are more clearly associated with the iconography of Ptolemaic queens, such as the appliqu?d figures of Arsino? II and her immediate successors on the Alexandrian faience oinochoai (cf. Thompson, Ptolemaic Oinochoai, 23ff., 82ff., 125ff., pis. Iff.). The importance of the cults of Isis and Osiris for Caligula's religious policies and imperial imagery, as maintained by K?berlein throughout his book, is doubtful, as has been meanwhile corrected by P. Herz, Historia 3 (1981), 324-36. The critique of Herz is probably too categorical, however, since Caligula was definitely absorbed by the mystique of the Ptolemaic monarchs, and the pattern of sibling unions within their dynasty was closely linked to the assimilation to Isis and Osiris, or Horus and Hathor; see Cheshire, Bronzes of Ptolemy II, ch. 2. 215 Wood, Imperial Women, 203ff., 212. 216 Such as one in Paris, Biblioth?que Nationale: Marie-Louise Vollenweider, Cam?es et intailles, Li: Les Portraits grecs du Cabinet des m?dailles (Paris, 1995), 143f., n. 136, pl. 71, color plate VI; or in Oxford, Ashmolean Museum 1892.1515: Marianne Hamiaux, RA 1996/1, 145ff.; Marie-Fran?oise Boussac in La Gloire d Alexandrie (exhibition catalogue Paris, Mus?e du Petit Pa lais, May 7-July 26, 1998 [1998]), 161, cat. . 103 (ill.). 217 See . 216. 218 G.

Eileithyia, the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian vulture goddess, Nech bet,226 is found frequently in the company of the Moirai, the Three Fates,227 and was regarded as an equivalent allegorical figure. Thus the Ptolemaic symbolism of a bond between royal sisters, even when separated by geographical distance or death, remained alive in Caligul?n propaganda. Evaluat ing the motives of Caligula in putting his three sisters in the forefront of royal propaganda, Wood228 emphasized that the Emperor, until very late in his reign, remained childless?a matter of grave con cern lest the Julian ancestral line be extinguished. Although giving clear preference to Drusilla, he was preparing the populace for a possible continuation of the succession through one of his sisters. When Drusilla died in A.D. 38, Caligula sought to establish her, in religious thought, as a divine ma triarch of the Imperial family. This intent was memorialized by the statue of Drusilla set up in the "Temple of Venus," presumably the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum Iulium in Rome.229 Drusilla's image in that temple was said to have been as large as the cult statue of Venus itself.230 Certain provincial issues of the Caligula sestertii prefix the legend to Drusilla's figure with "DIVAE," indicating that these coins, at least, were minted after her untimely death in 38 but before the death of Caligula and almost immediate exile of Agrippina and Livilla in 41.231 Two additional series of bronze coinage from Apamea bear the bust of all three sisters?a frontal image of Drusilla in the cen ter and her two sisters in profile facing her from either side.232 This, too, was a posthumous series on which Drusilla is distinguished in the legend as "DIVA," a higher status that was also pictorially expressed on the coins with a star over her head. The liberty with which the artists of small bronzes interchanged poses, costume and heads of differ ent types while retaining the essential iconography of the Greco-Egyptian goddess is illustrated by a Roman Period bronze statuette of unknown provenance in the Louvre.233 The Paris statuette's verti cal (i.e., less voluptuous) contours and the position of the arms?the left held in front of the breasts and the right hand holding the heavy mantle in front of her hips?recall the frequently repeated, familiar gesture of the Praxitelean or Capitoline Venus. The head bears some resemblance to the Paramythia bronze (fig. 4a-b), including the long, thin and twisted neck and the stronger turn of the head to the left. The face appears more idealized; the full lips and straight nose recall nothing of the Roman Imperial family, nor a reflection of the Ptolemaic queens who preceded them, but the head might well be a more generalized repetition of the "Drusilla" portrait on the Paramythia bronze. The Hellenistic coiffure, in which wavy tresses are drawn back loosely from the face and bound in a small knot at the nape of the neck, lacks the long, loose strands of hair falling onto the shoulders that are represented on the London bronze. The style of the Louvre piece?with its fussy swallowtail folds and effusive frills in the edging of the garment, along with the soulful gaze?could also date to the Caligulan-Claudian Period.

The statue of the Diva Drusilla must date before the death of Caligula in A.D. 41. A bronze statuette of a draped Venus, poised nonetheless in a gesture of pudicitia, in Marseille (fig. 7a-d)235 is also devoid of Egyptian regalia, excepting the ambiguous bird's scalp headdress (vul ture or dove), nor is there a bored hole or traces of welding that would have indicated the affixation of an Egyptian crown on top of that head covering. The modeling of the drapery is simplified, the chiton lying smoothly against the goddess's back and only slightly articulated into minimal folds on the front through a few well-spaced, dull incisions into the soft wax of the casting model. Similar thick cuts into soft wax mark the simple division between feathers on the back of the headdress (fig. Id). A lightly sketched, scale-like pattern, executed likewise in the wax model before casting, indicates the layered smaller feathers covering the back of the bird. The piece was acquired without prove nance, although thought by museum authorities to perhaps have come from Italy. The smooth, "waxy" surfaces of the cast bronze and lack of cold-working are potential indicators, however, that the piece was manufactured in Egypt.236 The thickly incised outlines of the feathers on the bird scalp might originally have been filled with gold?a typical Egyptian metalworking technique to enliven the otherwise plain surface.237 The greatest interest of the Marseille "Venus" is in the individualized rendering of the head with slight undulations in the surface of the flesh and detailed incised articulation of the crinkly waves of hair. The face bears distinctive portrait features: a broad, squarish face with a low forehead, promi nent, widely set cheekbones and a squared-off chin and jaw of almost equal width. The large eyes are slightly down-turned at the outer corners and are framed by broad, sweeping eyebrows that begin low at the nose-bridge and arch slightly upward as they spread outward, then hooking around the outer corners of the eyes. The large mouth is set in a solemn frown, echoing the somber expression of the eyes. The hair is a thick mass of tightly crimped waves, center-parted and packed in layers extend ing out at a distance from both temples, ending at mid-ear level and bound in the nape of the neck underneath the tail of the bird (fig. Id). The bushy arrangement of stacks of crimped waves of hair, lying relatively flat on top of the head and piled out to both sides like a squat, wide cap ending at ear level, is characteristic for one prominent Julio-Claudian lady: Drusilla's older sister, Agrippina minor.238 The identification of this sister's portraits rests on firmer ground since, in A.D. 49, some eight years after the death of her brother, Caligula, she married his successor, Claudius, and conducted a very effective and ambitious career as Empress, which she continued beyond his death in 54 with her son, the Emperor Nero. The mother-son duo was short-lived; Nero had his mother murdered in A.D. 59.239 Her portrait appears on coins of Claudius, where she is identified by inscription,240 and together with the portrait busts of either Claudius or Nero,241 although her finest profile likenesses 235 Marseille, Mus?e d'arch?ologie m?diterran?ene 2258.

A mar ble portrait head in Tripoli,249 of particu lar interest because of its probable North African provenance (Leptis Magna?) not far distant from Alexandria, also lacks the fringe of tiny curls and presents a good parallel to the head of the Marseille Empress in the compact and slightly blurred rendering of the crown of tiny curls.

A sardonyx cameo with an Egyptian provenance ("from the Fayum") in Bos ton250 bears double busts in high relief of the Emperor Claudius in capite velato type and an Empress in a stola. Provincial Egyptian taste reveals itself in the plump, puffy faces of both rulers; this distortion makes the identification of his consort difficult. Unlike the square face shape, wide jaw, the widely spread, pronounced eyebrows and bushy coiffure of Claudius' most prominent Empress, Agrippina the Younger, the cameo shows a woman with a more compact, close lying coiffure, cheeks that taper toward the chin, the eyes are small and lie more superficially. Before he wed Agrippina, Claudius was married to Messalina, a more obscure empress who did not issue her own coinage and has not been identified with any security among the numerous preserved monuments. The attribution of the cameo portraits most frequently suggested to "Claudius and Messalina"251 is, however, through process of elimination to be preferred. 240 B?schung, "Bildnistypen," 74. 24/ Karin Polaschek, "Studien zu einem Frauenkopf im Landesmuseum Trier und zur weiblichen Haartracht der iulisch claudischen Zeit," TrZ 35 (1972), 170-72, fig. 9, nn. 2, 5-7; Trillmich, "Beobachtungen," 137f. 248 Ancona, Museo Nazionale: S.

The vulture cap and the Aphrodite/Venus type on the Marseille statuette are likewise explicable in the career of Agrippina the Younger. The motif was adapted from that of her deified sister, but also would have referred to the precedent set cen turies ago by a number of Hellenistic queens. A powerful empress as the wife of Claudius, Agrip pina II was reputed to have engaged in philan thropy, extending the financial means necessary for parents to have children or to provide a daugh ter's dowry.252 Portrait statues and honorific in scriptions dedicated to her in the provinces hint at the likelihood that she contributed to the build ing or restoring of the temples of deities whose cults sponsored a similar agenda.253 Similar ges tures of charity were known of Livia,254 but the true prototypes for the Egyptianizing Venus fig ures with the vulture cap of an Egyptian queen were, of course, created for various Ptolemaic royal women.255 Just as her siblings, Caligula, Drusilla and Julia Livilla, the younger Agrippina was brought up in the courtly ambience of her grandmother, Antonia Minor, where she would have been surrounded by reminders of her ances tral link to the Ptolemies.200 A bronze replica of Roman date in New York (fig. 9)25/ wearing a bird's scalp headdress is un doubtedly of Egyptian manufacture and is close in type to the Venus statuette with portrait fea tures in Marseille.208 The bloated face, expanded to an almost perfect globe, and the plump phy sique of this Venus, even down to the chubby, dimpled hands, conform to the image of a wifely and motherly figure in Greco-Roman Egypt.2 )9 The goddess holds her hands before her body in a superfluous gesture of modesty, while the upper edge 232 Dio 58.2.2-3; Wood, Imperial Women, 258f. 253 Sec n. 252. -?4 Marleen Flory, "Sic exempla parantur: Livia's Shrine to Concordia and the Porticus Liviae," Historia 33 (1984), 309-30, esp. 319. 255 See nn. 49f. 236 See nn. 203f. 2o7 Metropolitan Museum of Art 26.7.1475.

The plump, rather pop-eyed face is atypical for an idealized representa tion, and the specific rendering of the coiffure points to a fashion of the later Antonine Period. The mass of wavy tresses drawn in large crescent forms back from the face and bound in a small knot in the nape of the neck appears, on the small scale statuette, not very differ ent from the timeless "melon" coiffure of Aphrodite/Venus. The peculiar method of crimping each lock of hair in front upwards in a horizontally ordered roll, pushed up in the center against the lock above to form a sequence of scallops around both sides of the face, was, however, a fashion set by Faustina the Younger, the daughter of Antoninus Pius and wife of his successor, Marcus Aurelius. A statue group of Mars and Venus from the Isola Sacra261 is an allegory for the marital bliss of the young couple destined to succeed Antoni nus Pius. The head of "Mars" is represented with the curly hair, beard and mustache of Marcus Aurelius, as known from his coin issues A.D. 144-47, while the head of "Venus" wears the modish hair style of Faustina minor that is shown also on the New York bronze "Venus." The monumental example wears a high crescent diadem and has two long locks of hair falling freely onto the shoulders, allud ing to the divine Venus type, but the facial features?in particular the large eyes, slanted downward at the outer corners and masked by drooping lids, the full cheeks and the tightly curled, somewhat protruding upper lip?reveal that it is the Empress Faustina, repre sented in the divine Venus type. A marble portrait head of the Empress in the Capitoline Mu seum,262 dating obviously to late in her life, or possibly posthu mously, is one of only a few known sculptural representations of a Roman Imperial Art in Greece and Asia Minor [Cambridge, Mass., 1968], 388, n. 13 with the identification. Zsolt Kiss, Etudes sia le portrait imperial romain en Egypte [Warsaw, 1984], 46, fig. 78, doubts this attribution and even the authenticity of the small marble head). The veiled Empress portrayed on a glass-paste cameo in Alexandria (Greco-Roman Museum 28928: Marie Fran?oise Boussac and Paola Starakis-Roscam, BCH 107 (1983), 456, n. 53, 457, fig. 52) may well be Agrippina the Elder again with an unusually bloated physiognomy and the puffy traits characteristic for some Claudian sculpture from Egypt. A green basalt bust of Germanicus in the British Museum (inv. 1883: Kiss, Etudes, 41, figs. 59f., with review of earlier literature), beau tifully carved in a native Egyptian stone, is remarkable for its bloated facial forms, otherwise not attested for his portraits. 260 Cf.

The large knot of hair bound at the back of the head on both examples is characteristic for several coiffures worn by Faustina mi nor late in her life. The replica from Cyprus is a rather bloated interpretation of the Empress's por trait, comparable to the Egyptian bronze statuette in New York. The small size of the knot of hair in the nape of the neck of the bronze figure is not true to the Roman hairstyle but was taken over from earlier replicas of the "Venus" type. An 18 cm. bronze Aph rodite/Venus in Cairo,265 which is of the same nude type with vulture's scalp, Egyptian crown, apple and wreath as the Louvre bronze (fig. la-c), an evidently very popular type, wears the same coiffure as the New York "Venus/Faustina" (fig. 9). The styling of the hair by twisting the individual strands into stiff tresses and rolling them back from the face in a round bouffant mass, as it started late in the reign of Faustina minor, continued in variations through the end of the second and early third centu ries A.D.,266 and the Cairo statuette, maybe again Faustina the Younger (see infra) but possibly not a portrait of any individual, should be dated within that time. The head of the bronze Venus in New York may be said to bear some resemblance to Faustina minor in that the round, chubby face, evoking a matronly appearance, the large eyes and a slightly convexly arched nose are characteristic of her portraits in glyptic and in the round, particularly later in her life.267 Upon comparison with one of the Younger Faustina's typical portraits, a marble head in Copenhagen (fig. \2a-b),26S the New York statuette is hardly a convincing likeness, but the Egyptian sculptor may not have been familiar with the appearance of the Roman Empress aside from coins. Often it is difficult to differentiate between portraits of the Diva Faustina and contemporary ideal images of goddesses, particularly in the minor arts, where Imperial portraits proliferate. Thus a Late Antonine chalcedony cameo bust in the Biblioth?que Nationale,269 representing a woman wearing a Stephane over the same modish coiffure of layered, scalloped waves of hair as on the Metropolitan stat uette (fig. 9), has been attributed by Micocki270 to "Faustina the Younger," while Vollenweider271 con sidered it to be a goddess. The long, oval head shape with flat cheeks is not typical for Faustina II, nor is the small, full-lipped mouth a portrait trait of hers, although it is similarly rendered on the New York bronze Venus. The same physiognomic discrepancies are found on the head of the Cairo bronze Venus, CG 27652, mentioned above. The fullness of flesh under the chin imparts a matronly appearance to the gem carving, as it does to the Egyptian bronze statuettes in New York and Cairo, and it is possible that that this trait is a reference to the Fecunditas of the Diva Faustina. The facial features of the cameo bust are hardly distinctive, however, while the head of the New York statuette, as a portrait of the Empress, is more recognizable. 263 Fittschen, Bildnistypen, 37, 42f., 63, 64, pl. 7.9-10. 264 V.

In his study of the likenesses of Faustina minor, Fittschen272 postulated the appearance on coins of a new portrait type of Antoni nus Pius' daughter and Empress-to-be, based on the creation of a new coiffure on the occasion of nine specific historical events in her career as prospective heir-producer. The distinction between as many as nine variations in her coiffure and the coincidence of each new portrait type with the events cited by Fittschen have met with some skepticism in subsequent scholarship,273 but the gen eral chronological sequence of the Empress' hairstyles and the consistent theme of childbearing on the reverse of those coins, including images with increasing numbers of children around their mother, can hardly be denied. Thus Fittschen's theory, even if somewhat arbitrary in certain defini tions of new portrait types, presumably has a good deal of merit. Already in A.D. 145, the long awaited marriage between the approximately fifteen-year-old Faustina minor (her mother was Faus tina maior) and the Emperor's adoptive son, Marcus Aurelius, was commemorated with issues of coins bearing his portrait, on the reverse an image of Concordia presiding over the dextrarum iunctio of an allegorical couple with the legend vota publica.274 The next portrait type of the future Em press, according to Fittschen, was occasioned by the birth of the couple's first child, a girl named Domitia Faustina, in 147. The occasion of births of subsequent offspring, including the eventual suc cessor to power, Commodus, were each celebrated in special coin issues with a new portrait type of their mother on the obverse. The reverse of these coins consistently bears a pictorial image related to Faustina ITs fecundity and success as an heir-producer: an image of Venus Genetrix carrying a child, or an image of Juno Lucina, the Roman goddess of childbearing, or a woman standing or seated on a throne, carrying or surrounded by numerous little children.275 The close association officially claimed for Faustina with Venus on her coinage was symbolized in her own portrait on the obverse, and the predominance of Venus Genetrix on the reverse, which was, however, frequently replaced by the simple image of a dove, the bird of Aphrodite/Venus.276 Since the dove was so common a symbol on Faustina's coins, it may well be asked whether the bird-scalp diadem of the New York "Venus/ Faustina" is ambiguous in its significance, reaching out to the Egyptian as well as to the Greco-Roman devotee. The propaganda of Faustina the Younger in Egypt, presenting her as the mother of an heir to the former kingdom of the Ptolemies, figures only on a small number of the widespread issues of modest copper coins from Alexandria. These bear a finely modeled portrait of the Empress on the obverse, on the reverse showing an image of an Egyptian distyle temple, within which is, seated on a throne, the goddess Isis nursing the infant Harpocrates, who is sitting on her lap (fig. I0a-b).277 Both mother and son wear Egyptian crowns, thus embodying the divine counterparts to the Empress and her latest male offspring. More often on the obverse, the portrait bust of a woman is at first glance only identifiable by the inscription around the circumference of the flan: FAUSTIN E , sometimes followed by E E E THYGA, "Faustina, the Empress, daughter (thygater) of the pious Emperor (Antoninus Pius)."

The portrait type of the Empress that was adapted on the Egyptian issues continued to be used in Egypt throughout the reign of her father, Antoninus Pius. Reworked dies degenerate into an image that resembles Faustina minor clearly only with respect to the coiffure: waves of hair arranged in loops, subdivided from each other as in a melon coiffure, from a center part down the sides of the face to the ears, the hair behind the ears gathered up and bound at the back of the head in a large, flat chignon. A thin braid of hair run ning diagonally down both sides of the head catches the back ends of the loops framing the face and binds them in. The routinely repeated profile bust of the Empress (fig. 13) on the Alexandrian issues shows a more oblong face than her coin images and other portraits outside Egypt generally suggest: a more flattened?almost squashed?nose that hooks down at the tip, and long, flat cheeks with an abruptly offset, bony, protruding chin. With this caricature, the coin image appears to imitate the squared-off, choppy features found on some series of look-alike coin portraits of Cleopatra VII and Marc Antony?as Jocelyn Toynbee280 appropriately described them, "nutcracker features."281 Thus the Younger Faustina's role as heir-producer to the Roman Empire was commemorated specifically in Egypt as a continuation of the Macedonian lineage of the country's last true queen, who bore children of two Roman Triumviri. 278 Fasti Ostienses: Inscrit XIII 1 (Rome, 1947), 207, 236f.; Fittschen, Bildnistypen, 23, 38. 279 Fittschen, Bildnistypen, 23 (with bibliog. in n. 10), pi. 1.3, 4, 8. 280 Roman Historical Portraits (London, 1978), 42f. 281 E.g., Kyrieleis, Bildnisse, 124, pl. 107.3 (Antiocheian mint?); Cleopatra of Egypt, 233, nn. 215-17 (Chalchis); 234, nn. 221 2 (Antioch?); 238, n. 250 (Eastern mint); R.

Interesting results on the use of the relatively common statuettes of the Greek love goddess in their provincial context have emerged from a survey of the papyrological documentation of Aphro dite bronzes in Roman Egypt by Fabienne Burkhalter.282 Rather than appearing in the inventories of temples, the context of their mention is consistently a domestic one. They are cited with astonishing frequency in Roman Period marriage contracts of the second and third centuries A.D., within a conven tional itemized list of the articles in the bride's dowry.283 Only rarely do they find mention in other contractual dealings, such as when a woman's "Aphrodite"?and possibly her entire dowry?had been put up as a guarantee for a pledge, in necessity to be pawned if a said business obligation could not be met.284 Thus the means of transfer of the valuable keepsake seems to have traditionally been to a new bride from her mother. Burkhalter285 concluded that the Aphrodite statuette symbolized protec tion and provision of well-being for the woman of the household of Roman Egypt, as may have Venus or a inno (a female counterpart to a genius of the man of the household)286 for matrons in their households in Rome, and as the lar famili?ris offered an entire family of Rome at a household altar.287 As observed by Celia Schultz:288 "Each domestic deity had a public counterpart, thus underlining the close relationship between practices within and outside the home." Connections of these mementos of Aphrodite/Venus with the ruler cult or with established state institutions, although almost never mentioned, may well have been more significant than is apparent. It appears also quite certain that a second Roman Period bronze statuette of Egyptian manufacture in the Metropolitan Museum (fig. lla-d)289 represents a Roman Imperial lady. Despite the typologi cal variation in the wrap-around mantle and the position of the arms, the woman's momentary move ment of the hands in front of her midriff recalls the various types of Aphrodite undressing for the bath and is certainly to be interpreted as making reference to the goddess. On this figure, three thick, twisted tresses of hair to each side of the face, drawn back from the temples and bound in a large, flat bun against the nape of the neck, are clearly demarcated from each other by deep undercutting, resembling the popular "melon" coiffure of late Classical-Hellenistic fashion. These horizontally arranged plaits of hair form a fairly narrow frame around the face; behind them runs a long, tight braid?or two thin parallel braids?diagonally across both sides of the head from the center part back to the knot. Two holes bored into the hair on top of the head to either side of the center part allowed for the attachment of a separately made attribute, probably a Stephane of gold or gilded bronze. This diadem would have concealed the awkwardly high column of the uraeus ring supporting the feather crown, a feature that might have blended in better had the statuette been given the familiar vulture's scalp diadem instead. The wax model used for the crown base was undoubtedly originally intended 282 "Les Statuettes en Bronze d'Aphrodite en Egypte romaine," RA 1990/1, 51-60. 283 Burkhalter, "Statuettes en Bronze," 51 f., 54f., 60; Jane Rowlandson, ed., Women and Society in Greek and Roman Egypt: A Sourcehook (Cambridge, U.K., 1998), 66, n. 42, 181f., n. 136. Even when the material of the "Aphrodite" is not specified in the document, it can almost certainly be assumed that it was of bronze, since a terracotta figurine would not have had a relevant monetary worth to figure in these lists of valuables. 284 Burkhalter, "Statuettes en Bronze," 51, 52f., 60; Rowlandson, Women and Society, 258ff., n. 191 (ROxyA, 114). 28;&gt; Burkhalter, "Statuettes en Bronze," 59. 286 Celia E.

A bronze vulture cap was applied over the head of the Louvre statuette from Lower Egypt (fig. la-b), possibly after the entire coiffure had been executed on the cast bronze figure, but there is no evidence of that having been the case on the New York statuette. The head of the New York bronze merits closer inspection, as the tight-lipped little smirk and the unusual rendering of the large chin suggest the portrait of a specific individual. The Venus Genetrix, the Capitoline Venus and popular Aphrodite/Venus types were adapted for private portrait sculpture of Roman matrons,290 and various attributes of Isis could have been assumed for the private deifica tion of women, as well,291 but these usages wrere restricted to conventional monuments of funerary cult, such as grave statues and stelae. Thus an identification of the Metropolitan statuette with an exceptionally prominent personality, such as an Empress, is certainly more probable. The coiffure in itself is distinctive, even though its compacted form, artificially enhanced by the present worn state of the surface of the bronze, has been substantially assimilated to the standard "Praxitelean" hair style of Aphrodite/Venus.292 It is the coiffure worn by Faustina Minor on certain coin emissions that Fittschen293 categorized as "Type 8" among nine portrait types of that Empress. The braid?or two thin parallel braids?has been often misconstrued in descriptions of the coins as a strand of pearl like beads, but large-scale sculptural portraits of Faustina, such as the afore-mentioned head in Copenhagen (fig. I2a-b), reproduce this feature of the coiffure as thin, plaited tresses of hair.294 This coiffure occurs regularly on the plentiful Alexandrian coins (assaria and billons) of Faustina II consis tently rendered with remarkable clarity.295 The style consists of a combination of crimped or twisted waves around the face, behind which run one single or a pair of thin braids of hair, a flat arrange ment of hair combed from a center part diagonally forward from the crown of the head, all of which is bound up in a large knot lying flat against the nape of the neck. Despite the precise detail work on the coiffure, the portrait head of the Empress on these coins appears to have been physiognomically inaccurate but nevertheless incessantly repeated. On the latter New York bronze "Venus," however, not only the coiffure but also the carefully sculpted face is arguably identifiable as Faustina the Younger. The round, full-fleshed visage, an in flated sphere without wrinkles, appears matronal with heavy, sagging skin beneath the chin and chubby cheeks on all but the earliest of her portraits. The most easily recognizable trait on Faustina's portraits are the eyes: broad and almond-shaped, on most portraits the gaze somewhat veiled by drooping lids, the pupils generally bored. They are rendered similarly on portraits of her husband, Marcus Aurelius, and their son, Commodus, and thus appear to have been considered at the time a hallmark of the Imperial family.296 Due to the small scale of the New York bronze "Venus," this fea ture was imitated in abbreviated form through undercutting of the upper lids, giving them a heavy appearance. Also characteristic for Faustina IFs portraits and for the era in sculpture as well, the eyes 290 See . 149. 291 E. J. Walters, Attic Grave Reliefs that Represent Women in the Dress of Isis.

In his study of the portrait types of Faustina II, Fittschen (see nn. 272, 273) assumed that the series of types was dictated from Rome and, as far as con cerned currency, was reproduced verbatim in the Imperial mints outside of the city; on this problem, see also Szaivert, M?nzpr?gung, 77ff. The possibility of the creation of a specific portrait type in Egypt, where the Empress accompanied Marcus Aurelius on a visit in 175 (see n. 319), is an interesting question that has yet to be investigated. 296 Fittschen, Bildnistypen, 58, 62, 66.</page><page sequence="38">188 JARCE 43 (2007) Fig. 12a-b.

The tight and tidy arrange ment of the hair on the second New York bronze "Faustina," a com plex modish hairstyle that has been optically assimilated in its contours to the Greek "melon coiffure," contributes further to the appearance of a dignified Roman lady, whose waves of hair would have been neatly crimped and braided?in striking contrast to the bronze portrait figure from Paramythia (fig. 4a-b), in which the goddess Drusilla "lets loose" in a typically Greek manner. While the portrait bust on the obverse of these coins remains consistent, the pictorial image on the reverse takes on a remarkable variety of different themes, includine an array of female allegorical figures?Dikaiosyne, Eirene, Elpis, etc. (using Greek terminology in Egypt and other Eastern prov inces)?that are typically associated with the Empress.803 The frequently appearing image of lustitia ("Justice") as a woman seated on a throne and holding out a scale,304 was a statement to the Roman populace that the Empress provided oversight over the honest regulation of the grain trade and the related corn dole (see infra). Centuries before the association of the Roman Empress in Egypt with the allegory of "Justice" as well as with the divine mother, Isis, Cleopatra III was called thea megale meter theon (the great goddess, mother of gods), Nikephoros ("Bringer of Victory") and Dikaiosyne ("Justice").305 Provincial variations of the image on the reverse of the Faustina coins include Isis Pharia,30b the Pharos lighthouse,307 Isis,308 (Isis)/Tyche,309 Triptolemus on his serpent-drawn char iot,310 Amnion,311 Serapis,312 and the Nile313?all subjects that can be connected to Egypt's agricultural wealth and the corn shipment from Alexandria to Rome. After the death of Antoninus Pius in A.D. 161 and the succession of Marcus Aurelius as sole emperor, the Alexandrian mint issued a more mature, corpulent and matronly coin portrait of the new Emperor's wife, Faustina, with or without the thin braid woven through her hair in back of the bulk of crimped waves framing the face. Again, the repeated juxtaposition of a portrait of the Empress on the obverse with images of a variety of female deities and personifications on the reverse, in particular Tyche,314 implies a close relationship?if not direct assimilation?of Faustina to these figures. The New York "Faustina/Venus" statuette differs from the other examples discussed above in that it does not wear the Egyptian vulture diadem but probably instead a separately made Stephane. With or without that royal attribute, the circlet of uraeus serpents form the support for a separately cast, 302 See . 6. 303 Gei?en, Katalog II, 412-31, nn. 1943-94. 304 Gei?en, Katalog II, nn. 1944, 1949, 1959, 1969, 1975, 1981, 1992; idem., Katalog III, n. 2108. 3(b Otto and Bengtson, Niederganges, 151 ff.; Koenen, "Kleop?tra III.," 61ff. 30(i Gei?en, Katalog II, nn. 1943, 1970. 307 Gei?en, Katalog II, n. 1973. 308 Gei?en, Katalog II, n. 1960. 309 Gei?en, Katalog II, n. 1971. 310 Gei?en, Katalog II, n. 1958. 311 Gei?en, Katalog II, nn. 1962-63. 312 Gei?en, Katalog II, nn. 1980, 1982-83, 1986, 1989. 313 Gei?en, Katalog II, 1968, 1977-79. 314 Gei?en, Katalog III, 54-59, nn. 2108-19.</page><page sequence="40">190 JARCE 43 (2007) native crown of a sun disc framed by a pair of tall cow's horns, from behind which rise a pair of tall ostrich feathers, the most common pharaonic Egyptian diadem for royal women and goddesses, par ticularly, Isis. The pair of corn ears that flank the base of the crown are a Ptolemaic addition, men tioned specifically for the first time in the Canopus Decree in the description of a special crown to be made for the prematurely deceased daughter of Ptolemy III and Berenice II, a princess Berenice.315 On the statuette of the deified Empress Faustina, they symbolize her role as the protectress of the fleets carrying grain deliveries, the annona, to Rome.316 In the second century A.D., the success of state policy in the gigantic task of providing the populace of Rome, as well as the army deployed throughout the vast empire with adequate supplies of grain, was a consistent theme in the pictorial decoration of the Imperial coinage. Typically, a portrait bust of the reigning Empress on the obverse was paired with an image of Ceres or a personification of Annona on the reverse. 317 G. Rickman318 observed that, while Faustina II/Ceres coins were issued throughout the reign of Marcus Aurelius, a large supply of the Empress's coins were minted in A.D. 174/75, which he concludes was in response to a revolt led by Avidius Cassius in the Eastern provinces which threatened to endanger Rome's grain import. The image of Annona accompanying that of the Empress on these issues was intended to assure the subjects of Rome that their Egyptian grain supply was still in Imperial control.319 The Imperial couple traveled through the East, including to Egypt, in that year with the aim of quelling the revolt of Cassius; the Empress died in 176 in Cappadocia upon the trip back to Rome.320 After Faustina's death, Marcus Aurelius established in Rome a special relief fund for the puellae Fausti nianae, young women who were entitled to rations of grain from the state "from the Diva Faustina Iunior'321 The figurative role of Faustina the Younger with respect to Egypt has been confirmed in recent years by the discovery of an inscribed dedication from the dockyard area of Alexandria, set up by an association of attendants of the statues of the Imperial family, to Faustina the Younger, calling her as well Sosistolos (a savior of the fleet), Pharia (the goddess of the lighthouse of Alexandria, identified with Isis), and the New Augusta.^22 In the vicinity was located the Caesareum, a magnificent complex described in the first century by Philo.323 In his day, it was a sanctuary to the Kaisar epibaterios, "the Emperor (Augustus) at the wharf," but it is highly probable that the monument was built already under Cleopatra VII in memory of Julius Caesar and was redirected to the cult of Augustus after the Roman conquest of Egypt. The apparent assimilation of the bust of Faustina the Younger on Alexan drian copper assaria to earlier coin portraits of Cleopatra VII, as commented on above, may have intended to present the Empress as the successor to Egypt's last queen. The nude, Hellenistic version of Aphrodite in a standard pudica pose of a bronze statuette in Cairo324 was combined with a portrait head that can probably be attributed to Crispina, the ill-fated wife of Faustina's and M.

The nude Venus type was not uncommonly used for portrait statues of empresses and distinguished matrons throughout the Roman Empire and would have had no particular theological significance in Egypt. The pronounced curves of her hips, swinging out from a wasp waist, mark a departure from the Praxitelean prototype and its Hellenistic offshoots and are doubtless gauged to Alexandrian taste. This Oriental ideal of a womanly figure is illustrated time and again on the representations of the Goddess of Love and Beauty that were such a popular motif on late Roman bone carvings from Egypt, in particular as decoration on toilet articles such as combs.327 The diadem that "Crispina/Venus" wears imparts a similar symbolism to the "Alexandrian" Venus figures with the vulture's scalp or other royal insignia. The row of round tabs lined up along the top of the crown would, in actuality, have been decorated with miniature busts of deities to whom the wearer was particularly devoted or each with a portrait cameo or a portrait bust appliqu? of a mem ber of the ruling family and their immediate lineage.328 Examples of such diadems can be found in sculpture with particular frequency in the late second to third centuries a.D., but the small-scale appli qu? busts are often too crudely executed or poorly preserved to permit identification today. Thus the precise significance of these diadems is, to date, poorly understood.329 As is the case with the Egyp tian figures wearing the native vulture diadem, Crispina appears to be represented as Venus with a Roman crown symbolizing her prospective role?never to be fulfilled?as Genetrix of the Antonine line. An isolated attestation of a cult of "Aphrodite Cleopatra" occurring in Memphis in the third cen tury a.D.330 is probably a vestige of the Ptolemaic ruler cult, now transformed into the worship of a goddess, but it could reflect the nostalgic revival of a long dormant cultural icon. In the early third century in Rome, Cassius Dio331 viewed the statue of Cleopatra VII alongside the cult statue of Venus in the Temple of Venus Genetrix?a. proof of the longevity of the Egyptian queen's feminine mystique. The Memphite text provides an actual name for a syncretistic goddess that could be reflected?at least in the statuary type, if not in the portrait head?in several of these small bronzes.
