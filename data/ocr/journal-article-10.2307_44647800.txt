Hamon Laboratory of Physiology and Biomechanics Peugeot-Renault Association (France) C. Got and A. Patel I.R.B.A. Raymond Poincare' Hospital Garches, France J. Hureau Faculty of Medicine University of Paris France ABSTRACT. A series of fresh human cadaver and Part 572 dummy tests was performed under different conditions which were comparable to those of real -world accidents. A European car model mounted on a sled was used; a pair of knee- targets was fixed directly to the car body in front of the passenger knees. Test conditions are summarized as follows: h u man- 3- pt- bel ted cadaver with a sled impact velocity of 50 or 65 kph; 2-pt (thoracic )-belted-cadaver with a velocity of 65 kph, the legs being positioned normally or in an oblique manner. Since the knee-thigh-hip tolerance is re- lated to the shape and duration of the impact pulse, these interactions were the subject of a study. The tolerance to fractures depends to a great extent on the subject's bone condition. In order to predict the risk of fracture for the whole population from the tolerance found in the tested subjects, studies of mineraliza- tion and bone strength were carried out on the compact-bone-sections taken from the femurs of the tested cadavers. Tests were conducted also, using a Part 572 dummy, which enabled to predict a criterion for the knee-thigh-hip protection matched to this surrogate. Discussion of similar attempts, such as F.I.C. (Femur Injury Criterion) and K.T.H.I.C. is included. THE FEMUR TOLERANCE and the corresponding pro- tection criterion in frontal collisions have long been a controversial topic. There are great discrepancies between the values proposed by different countries and organizations. As mentioned in a recent paper (1)*, criteria ran- ging from 4 KN in United Kingdom to 10 KN were proposed. A reason for these differences could ^Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. be the test conditions. This led the authors to contemplate establishing a knee-thigh-hip pro- tection criterion from experiments performed under realistic conditions. Besides, the analy- sis of the results had to pinpoint the effect of duration on the tolerance and criteria, accor- ding to existing literature. A survey of available papers concerning the femur tolerance, and particularly the Femur Injury Criterion (F.I.C.) (12) yields the main facts. It can be summarized that the femur frac- ture tolerance depends on the methods and mate- rials used in the tests. Two principal groups may be classified as follows: - firstly, a set of important values for the compression forces sustained by the femur; they are associated with the shorter impact pulse durations. An impactor was used for stri- king the knees; it was actuated by free fall (2), air gun ( 3) ( 4) ( 5) ; a pendulum was also utilized (6)(7)(8). Peak knee forces up to 25 KN were recorded: the pulse duration was shorter than 20 ms . - secondly, a set of reduced tolerable for- ces, associated with the longer impact pulse durations. These data were obtained from sled tests with impact targets for the knees, fixed onto the sled ( 9) ( 10) ( 11). In this group, the tolerable femur compression force was about 6 KN (9) or 7 KN (10), and the pulse durations were evaluated at about 30 ms. To achieve a sensible protection criterion requires a realis- tic approach as regards the test conditions, on the one hand, and an in-depth analysis of the force-time history on the other hand. For realism, tests with belted fresh cada- vers were performed in a current car body moun- ted on a sled. Concerning the influence of the force-time history, severalrssearchers have already done some interesting work. Cooke and Nagel (2) concluded that the peak force must be associated with the energy absorbed. Mel vin et al. (3) suggested that the peak force could be used in conjunction with the impulse.

Another attempt made in this paper is to relate the force to the pulse duration and the impulse. Further, in order to predict the occurrence of femur fracture for the population at risk, cor- rection factors have to be applied. Muscle tension effect ( 3) ( 13) ( 14) ( 1 5) ( 16) and the anthropometrical data of the tested subjects have to be taken into account. For comparing the dead bodies used in the tests and the population at risk, studies concerning the mineralization and the strength of the femurs were performed . In order to define a femur protection criterion, runs with a Part 572 ATD were car- ried out. The method - a priori- was to make a comparison between the knee force-time history measured on dead bodies and axial femur-time history measured by transducers fit .to the upper legs of the dummy. Other factors had to be taken into consideration. METHODOLOGY. Runs were performed with dead bodies and dummies. The human surrogate is placed in the front passenger seat of a vehicle body mounted on a sled. Retarder tubes allow a car decele- ration to be simulated. A belt system is provi- ded for the restraint, and the knee impact forces are recorded. Two plane rigid disks are mounted on a bracket in front of each knee. They are covered with a 2.5 cm thick polyurethane padding, the density of which is equal to .115. The position of the disks may be that of a knee bolster in a car body. Its height can be adjus- ted. Spacing of the centerlines of the 2 disks corresponds to the distance berween the knees of a Part 572 dummy placed according to the procedure in FMVSS 208. Independent measurements of impact loads against each knee are obtained by means of half-bridge gauges. The measurement device is sensitive to the normal component of the impact load. However, due to the seat and disk height adjustments, the angle between the thigh axis and the perpendicular to the impacted disk remains small. Figure 1 shows a general lay-out of the test materials. Human subjects used are fresh unembalmed cadavers which undergo for other purposes spe- cial treatment before the test, already descri- bed (17). The experiments take place less than four days after death, the bodies having been stored in the meantime in a cold room at 2° C. For the subjects, a preliminary selection was made based on bone quality: subjects who were involved in accidents involving lower members, or who suffered from bone diseases were not submitted to tests. Autopsies were carried out, with particular emphasis on the knee-thigh-hip complex. Measurements made, beyond the usual ones, were of pelvis decelerations and restraint forces. These measurements added to the femur loads for the dummy and to the knee impact forces enable one to perform a better analysis of the results. This analysis is facilitated by the aid of films and by the bone characteri- zation of the subjects, explained later-on. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SUBJECT'S LEG SKELETON - If the tolerance level of the popu- lation at risk is aimed at, this characteriza- tion must be made as far as possible. The number of dead bodies considered here is still insuffi- cient for statistic processings; however, data are gathered as regards mineralization and mecha- nical resistance of the femurs submitted to runs . 1 ./ Bone Mineralization Analyzes - After the test, parts of the femur were taken from different areas and calcinated in the ove* at 700° C. The location of the samples is shown on Figure 2. They consist of: - A 3 cm fragment taken from the middle of the femur, - an upper fragment of 3 cm, taken near the lower limit of the trochanter minor, - a lower fragment, 3 to 4 cm long, the upper end of which is located at the start of the lower widening zone of the diaphysis; its lower end is supracondylar. The calcination yields the average weight of ashes per unit of volume, noted C/V. 2./ Mechanical Tests - They encompass com- pression and bending tests. For the compression tests, two tubular parts of the femur were taken. They are actually located between the parts used for the calcina- tion, and shown in Figure 2. Their length is about 8 cm, with a length /diameter ratio close to 5/1. The specimen is compressed longitudi- nally between parallel planes. The plunger velo- city is 5 mm/mn . Pictures of the surfaces of the cortical areas are taken before the tests. Ulti- mate compression force is recorded. For the bending tests, the specimens were undamaged femurs; they are loaded transversaly, as shown in Figure 3. Simple computations yield the ultimate bending stress.

TESTS AND TEST CONDITIONS - A first series of tests with dead bodies was performed at 50 kph with 3-pts belts. Knee impact severity proved to be insufficient, due to the efficiency of the restraint provided by the 3-pts belts. The 'belt slacks and the collision severities were there- fore increased in the later tests. A second series was consequently performed at 65 kph. In a third series, only a diagonal belt restrained the body. The fourth series consisted in reproductions of the previous runs with P. 572 dummies. Test conditions are summa- rized in Table 1 below. peak force would be a reasonable mean for the estimation of the injury potential. In 1977, Viano (12) studied in-depth, on the basis of the available results, how the force femur tolerance depended on the pulse duration. It can be easily understood that the peak force tolerable by a femur depends not only on the pulse duration but also on the im- pulse. It would be interesting, if a conventio- nal factor could be derived together from the total pulse duration and impulse. Such a factor called "conventional pulse duration" is defined as follows: Table 1 - Dynamic Test Conditions. Sled Knee-Target Subject No. Impact Deceleration Stopping Distance or Velocity max.

Cooke and Nagel in 1969 (2) from their drop weight impact tests on unembalmed cadavers, observed that the femur tolerance depended on both the peak force and the energy transmitted to the knee. Using an impactor actuated by an air-gun Melvin et al. conducted in 1975, impact tests on the legs of seated unembalmed human cadavers. They suggested that the impulse computed with the force/time history, in conjunction with the Corresponding to cadaver knee-impact tests, a general peak force-time profile is shown in figure 4. The impulse (I) can be calculated as time integral of whole force-time profile: I = ( T f (t) dt (1) Jo where T is total pulse duration. For defining the "conventional pulse duration", the same value of the impulse is expressed by the product of the peak force (F max) and the "conventional pulse duration" (Te ); that is:</page><page sequence="5">PROTECTION CRITERION 4 . 551 I = F max X Tg (2) where T¿is homogeneous to a duration. The quan- tity Té determined from the association of (1) and (2) is given as: Jo (T . Jo fit) dt (3) £ F max . The value of the peak force (F max.) is used for defining a criterion, when associated with impulse (I) and with pulse duration (T), as described respectively in (3) and (12). It would be appealing and preferable when defining the femur tolerance, if peak force as a function of "Conventional Pulse Duration" (Té ) could be used because Tt links the impulse (I) and the total pulse duration (T). The analysis of the available results will indicate if the tolerance definition is improved in this way. F F T_-__ T rmax Dm T Figure 4 - General Peak force Time Profile in Cadaver Knee impact Tests. RESULTS. HUMAN SUBJECTS AND TEST CONDITIONS - The anthropometrical data of the tested human cada- vers are presented in Table 2. The autopsies were conducted by the anatomist for all subjects after knee-impact tests. Descriptions of the in- juries are also presented in Table 2, only for the knee-thigh-hip system. The injuries found in other corporal parts and organs are not presen- ted here. The legs of each subject were positio- ned normally, excepting one (296) positioned in an oblique manner. The reason for testing this one is to obtain more information on the diffe- rent injury severities between the legs positio- ned normally and obliquely. . The test conditions such as restraint belt system, impact velocity and sled decele- ration are presented in table 1. They can be summarized as three different groups: - first group: subjects with 3-pt-belts at impact, V = 50 kph; - second group: subjects with 3-pt-belts at impact, V = 65 kph; - third group: subjects with 2-pt-belts (shoulder belt), V = 65 kph. KNEE- IMPACT TESTS WITH HUMAN CADAVERS - The results of knee-impact tests are given in Table 3. The peak knee-impact loads were recor- ded respectively for each femur by the knee tar- gets. They were normal components applied to knee targets. With the aid of mechanical analy- sis and motion picture studies, these loads can be considered to be the axial forces passing through the femur. The impulse (I) is calculated with the integration of knee -impact force time profile (I = Jo f(t) dt). The conventional pulse dura- tion (Te ) developed in this paper, as described above, is a factor associated with the impulse and peak force. Total pulse duration (t) is the period during knee contact with target. Peak knee-impact loads of human cadavers (F max.) versus conventional pulse durations (Te ) are illustrated in Figure 5. It is shown clearly in this figure that the fracture and non-fracture data points locate respectively at the right-upper corner and left- lower corner of the figure. The limit of the potential load to produce the femur fracture can be expressed by a line passing through 280L, 294R and 281R, and then turning at 281R, paral- lely to axis T. This line supplies basic values for defining femur injury tolerance. This for- mula is given as below: s I f(t) dt F = a - bT and where Tc c = ^ c - c c F max . where a = 23.4 KN, b = 0.72 KN/ms when TŁ&lt; 21ms, and F = 8.3 KN when Tg ? 21 ms. Its "shape" looks like the Viano's FIC (12) but the time definition is different. The accuracy of this limit is discussed later on.

Results are presented with cadaver test ones in Table 3. This table illustrates the discre- pancies between the cadaver and the Part 572 ATD responses in that type of test.

C. LEONG, ET AL. 6 cm. The area of the impact bone corresponding to the broken end during the compressive tests, were measured at BH section before tests. The ultimate load is a peak load varied from 4150to 6600kgf, with a mean value of about 5.4 KN. The mean strain and the mean ultimate compressive strength are about 1.9 % and 12.13 kgf/mm2. The compact bone area is the area measured at the middle section of the femur, about 490 mm2. Smaller strength found in this femur part, when compared to the intact bone result is due to the open ends of the compressed specimen. The ends of the femur, on the contrary, are closed. However that may be the two kinds of tests are not similar. BENDING TESTS - The specimens were the intact femurs taken from the knee-impact tested cadavers. The experimental method was used with a 3-point bending test, illustrated in Figure 3. The results are in Table 4. No significant corre- lation was found between the ultimate loads in compression and in bending tests. CALCINATION - The locations of the speci- mens are shown in Figure 2. The ash content C was obtained after calcination. The volume V of the compact bone was measured before calcina- nation. The unitfash contenti defined by C/V (g/cm3), varied from 0.99 to 1.27 g/cm3. Because the broken ends of all proximal specimens occur- red at the lower end (BH section), the results of the calcination presented in Table 5 were for the middle femur specimen (between BH and HB section) which was adjacent to the broken end of the compressive test specimens. DISCUSSION. Complementary studies aimed at determining tools for a better estimation of the tolerance of the population at risk. They are discussed firstly as follows. ULTIMATE LOAD AND COMPACT BONE AREA - Based on the available results presented in Table 4, the ultimate load of the femur versus the com- pact bone area is shown in Figure 6. A good cor- relation between these two parameters can be found. The ultimate load of the femur increases with the increase in compact bone area at the midpoint of the femur. This fact draws attention to the need to adjust the femur fracture toleran- ce. Actually, the difference in ultimate load between maximum and minimum already exceeds 60 % caused by different bone areas. From the view of general knowledge, it would appear that the po- tential load to produce the femur fracture isrela- ted with ultimate load which is a function of the compact bone area. Consequently, it is neces- sary to find a parameter, such as an anthropome- tric parameter of the subject which connects with compact bone area. Due to a lack of this knowledge, we are attempting to establish here a relationship between the compact bone area and subject weight. However, the relationship of compressive strength between a segment speci- men and an intact femur will be also investigated. COMPACT BONE AREA AND WEIGHT OF SUBJECT - Fron available results, the compact bone areas at mid-femur versus the weights of the subjects are illustrated in Figure 7. It seems that the compact bone area correlates somewhat with the weight of the subject. The latter is an anthro- pomorphic parameter found easily from the tested subject. The mean weight of the tested subjects is about 60 kg with a relative compact bone area of 400 mm2. Corresponding to 75 kg, a relative area is about 500 mm2. An adjustment for ultima- te load of the femur segment is to make a 20 % increase from 5000 kgf to 6000 kgf . Assuming a uniform increase in strength, the adjustment for the peak knee-impact load would be taken paralleli y with the rate, the minimum fracture load found here would approach 10 KN (from 8.3 KN of the subject 281 R) . This is just a hypothesis given here, further study for con- firmation is necessary. In this case, the conven- tional pulse duration (Tj ) should be also norma- lized using the dimensional analysis. ASH CONTENT AND ULTIMATE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTHS (U.C.S.) - As described previously by researchers (19, 20), the ultimate compressive strength (U.C.S.) relates strongly with ash content. Results support this statement. In Figure 8, one can also find this relationship, excepting point 281 beyond the cluster of points. Explanation for this point is that this subject had sustained relatively severe femur injuries during the knee-impact test. Consequently, the ultimate compressive strength was diminished in the axial compressive test. However, the results encourage us to conti- nue conducting the mineralization analysis of the bones which should be associated with the car crash test programs using dead bodies. Actu- ally, the mineralization analysis justified to eliminate No. 233 from our list in the knee- impact results program because of a very poor bone condition, as described in a previous paper (17). Average unit ash content is about 1.14 g/cm3 obtained from our specimens, corresponding to a value of 60 % for a normal bone with density of 1.9 (19) in air-dried conditions. Robinson (21) gave this value between 54.5 to 62.1 %. Mean ultimate compressive strength (U.C.S.) and strain are 12.13 kgf/mm2 and 1.9%. The ultimate compressive strength of 17.7 kgf/mm2 cited in reference (22) for Calabrisi (1951). The specimens were hollow cylindrical frag- ments in an unembalmed or fresh condition.

For the third series of tests, all data points locate in the "fracture" area, excepting 294 L. The most femur fractures occurred in this area. Actually, five fracture points are found out of six. It is easily under- standable, because the test conditions with a 2-pt (shoulder belt) and at 65 kph are more severe than for the first two series using a 3-pt-belt and at 50 or 65 kph. A peak knee-impact load of 8.3 KN sustained by 281 R is the lowest value among the fracture points. It is considered as a static test value shown by a line parallel to T t axis: a value of 8.4 KN was used by Viano (12), it is found that three non fracture points have a greater load value and shorter T £ in relation to 281 R. This case with the present criterion corresponds to a limit, as indicating that load value de- creases as T¿ increases (Figure 5). When load value is determined, T^ is a function of impul- se. From this analysis, one can recognize again that peak load level alone cannot indicate femur fracture risk. Present conventional pulse dura- tion might complement this insufficiency. The tolerance limit of figure 5 consists of two parts, one horizontal and one oblique. As previously mentioned, the horizontal part close- ly corresponds to static tolerance values, alrea- dy published, and is not deeply questionable. On the contrary, the oblique part is drawn from only a few points. No. 281 excepted, the corres- ponding subjects have a weight and a bone condi- tion which suggests no particular remarks. One can observe the similarity between the limit of the Viano's criterion ( FIC) (12) and the limit proposed here when the impact duration diminishes until zero. This similarity is due purely to chance; however, it supports the pro- posed values for the femoral complex tolerance. Remark: Muscle Effect - As described above, because of the estimates based on compact bone area, the load to regularly produce femur frac- ture would reach 10 KN. The authors of the paper believe that this value is sometimes and to a certain extent a conservative one for predicting the femur injury tolerance in a real accident. It has been recognized by research workers (22, 23, 4, 24) that the hip muscular effect would diminish the tensile stress in the femoral shaft when a force is applied from the knee to the head of the femur. Because of the eccentricity of the femoral head and neck from the long shaft axis, great bending stresses were concentrated at the late- ral region at the proximal part. This fact was demonstrated by the investigation in the knee-impact tests with human cadavers (22). In the living subject, muscular contraction occurs particularly in the tensor faciae latae. Consequently, the tensile stress would be redu- ced by the equilibrium of the muscular force action . Although no references can be found to prove and qualify this muscular effect allowing to predict a greater femur tolerance level for the living, but the fact of muscular action leads us to believe that the present proposed femur injury tolerance is conservative for "active" victims. PROBLEM OF THE CRITERION TO BE MET WHEN USING A DUMMY - At this step, let us assume that sufficient knowledge is got concerning femur complex tolerance, and let us consider the corresponding criterion for a given A.T.D. submitted to the same test. The correction factor depends largely on the type of test. As an example, 2 identical blows can be perfor- med by means of a pendulum against the knee of a seated ATD or cadaver and a correction factor is easily given by such a method for such a type of experiment. On the contrary, in a car body, the restraint, the differences in trajectories, in position, in distance bet- ween the knees and their stopping areas, make the point very different; concerning the tests re- ported here, the knee-impact speeds against the targets, estimated by film analysis, are repor- ted in Table 3. It appears clearly that the knees of the dummies strike the targets at higher speeds than cadaver knees. The mechani- cal response of the dummy knee is not the pri- mary cause, according to Figure 9. This figure is a plot of the forces exerted on the knee targets as a function of the quantity body mass X knee impact speed (as a matter of fact, the normal component of the speed to the target). The main difference between the forces exerted by Part 572 and cadavers on the targets is due to the knee-impact velocities. This is true even if the weights of the cadavers are close to the weight of a Part 572 ATD. Reasons for so important differences have to be analyzed. Presently, it is not sound to use the ca- libration factors obtained in tests where the knee impact speeds were similar for ATD and cadavers, due to the test conditions which concerned unrestrained human surrogates. A first calibration factor defined by the ratio: dummy target force cadaver target force could be infinite if the dummy reaches the targets and cadavers do not. No restraint was used in the tests repor- ted in (8) and (25), the results of which were utilized for defining calibration factors. On the contrary, the second necessary calibration factor: Dummy target force Dummy femur force can be roughly estimated (1). Available data are not sufficient to clari- fy the problems related to the first calibration factor. Consequently, two questions have to be answered: - Have different injury criteria to be defi- ned for the restrained and unrestrained dummies? - Is it possible to design an ATD, kinema- tics and impact response of which well duplicate</page><page sequence="12">4.558 Y.

Presently, due to the huge differences in knee-impacts of restrained P. 572 and cadavers in frontal collisions, a criterion based on tolerance estimates, corrected for the femur response of the dummy at the same knee impact speed is highly conservative. The tolerance limit proposed here could constitute a protec- tion criterion when associated to a really human- like ATD. TESTING THE VALIDITY OF THE VIANO FEMUR INJURY CRITERION (F.I.C.) USING CURRENT BIOME- CHANICAL DATA - In the femur injury criterion developed by Viano (12), the duration of the primary force exposure and the peak applied load are simultaneously taken into account. A permis- sible peak knee load dependence upon the duration of the primary force exposure is given following the formula (in which KN and ms are used for units): F = 23.14 - 0.71 T T &lt; 20 ms F = 8.90 kn T - 20 ms In figure 10, the limit corresponding to this femur injury criterion is shown in a force versus pulse graph duration. The points represen- ting the present test results are distributed on both sides of the criterion limit. Two points corresponding to two fractured femurs are situa- ted in the "uninjured" area and so are at varian- ce with the criterion. These two subjects have a normal bone condition (Table 4). Therefore it seems that the complete set of biomechanical data shows that the FIC is somewhat optimistic: nevertheless its principle can be kept for other studies and comparisons, regardless of the dummy problem. One can recall the similarity between the limit of FIC for T = 0, and the limit proposed here (Te= 0) drawing through. TESTING THE KTHIC VALIDITY BY MEANS OF PRESENT DUMMY TESTS AND BIOMECHANICAL DATA - A comparison, for two test series, of the results obtained in the dummy tests with the results of the cadaver tests, with reference to the inju- ries sustained by the cadavers in these tests, enables the testing of the validation of the KTHIC, the knee-thigh-hip injury criterion deve- loped by G. Nyquist (1). For the two Part 572 dummy tests, the avai- lable recorded femur forces exceed the 8450 N threshold, proposed by Nyquist, as a limit for the appearance of injuries. The Femur Number (FN) was computed for each force pulse, accord- ing to the KTHIC definition, with peaks in ex- cess of 8450 N. Only for the tests with a diago- nal belt system does the FN exceed the proposed 3.0 10^ lb^-S.s tolerance limit. That means: - the first series of tests with a 3-pt- belt system is considered as non injurious, according to KTHIC. - the second series (65 kph-diagonal belt system) is considered as injurious, according to the same criterion. If the injuries sustained in the correspon- ding cadaver tests are considered, the indica- tions given by the KTHIC regarding the severity of the two series of test conditions are confir- med (see Table 1) in these cases. However, the correction factors between tests with ATD and dead bodies are a questionable matter. Therefore, the "calibration factors" used for establishing the KTHIC have to be examined more closely. We have the possibility to analyse our cadaver data in terms of KTHIC. This method was developed with existing biomechanical data { 4) ( 24) ( 25) , for which the bone condition and anthropometry of the subjects were not availa- ble. If this method is used for our cadaver data, the direct computation of the C and K (Nyquist 's correction parameters) does not con- firm the previous indications regarding the severity of the two different series of tests. The second series of tests seems in this case non injurious. Besides, it seems that, among the biomecha- nical data used by Nyquist, some are matched to those human subjects with a poor bone condi- tion, the latter induce an increased scatter in the data of a same set. Further, it is recal- led that Nyquist used the center of gravity of the data set minus 2/3 standard deviation of peak force. CONCLUSIONS 1 . A good agreement as regards the order of magnitude is found between the tolerance levels when the femur is axial ly compressed by external blows on the one /land and under realis- tic car crash conditions on the other hand. 2. Based on the available experimental results, the Femur Tolerance can be defined as: F = 23.4 - 0.72 T when T &lt; 21 ms, F = 8.3 KN when T ^ 21 ms. Where T is the conventional pulse duration. 3. This conventional pulse duration is defined by: ( f(t)dt X . Jo £ F. max when F. max is determined, T g is a function of impulse. Using F. max associated to impulse enables to obtain a satisfactory explanation of the present results. 4. This tolerance is probably a conserva- tive one, anthropometric parameters, muscle tension effect and age are reserved for the necessary corrections. 5. Analysis of mineralization and more gerenal ly the bone characterization is necessary for the utilization of cadaver tests, and parti- cularly for the femur. 6. A good correlation between the mid-femur shaft area and the weight of the dead body was found. The latter may be a useful parameter, when used for the correction of the criterion. 7. A good correlation between ash contents and ultimative compressive strength was found in the specimens obtained from latter knee-impact tested subjects .</page><page sequence="14">4.560 Y. C.
