<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Papers in the first group by Kaj Birket-Smith and Helge Larsen may be singled out for comment. The former provides an authoritative and comprehensive survey of the current status of the problem of Eskimo origins, including a synthesis of the archaeology; and the latter, a concise summary of the Larsen-Rainey monograph on Ipiutak culture, together with a brief account of the more recent finds. Discussions by Fred- erica de Laguna and Diamond Jenness, respectively, bring out differences of viewpoint, particularly as re- gards the relationship of Ipiutak to Old Bering Sea. While Birket-Smith and Larsen consider Ipiutak to be ancestral to Old Bering Sea, their American colleagues argue that the two are contemporaneous, a position which is more nearly in accord with the subsequently obtained radiocarbon dates. There is agreement, how- ever, on the Asiatic origin of much of Ipiutak culture. The papers on the archaeology of the United States include 4 preliminary reports or summaries of research. Carlyle Smith gives a preview of his American Museum monograph on the archaeology of coastal New York; James B. Griffin presents a discussion of 6 Middle Mississippi ceramic forms, taken from a chapter in the Phillips, Ford, and Griffin monograph on the lower Mississippi Valley; L. Pendleton summarizes the Gallina culture, largely on the basis of Hibben's finds and publi- cations; and Herbert W. Dick discusses the findings at Bat Cave. Dick's paper is probably the most useful and significant of the 4, in the absence of the final report on Bat Cave and in view of the importance of this site for the problems of the origin of corn and the position of Cochise culture. Two of the papers are theoretical in nature. Com- menting on Mexican-Southeastern contacts, J. Charles Kelley proposes a route along the southern part of the Gilmore Corridor and thence eastward through the coastal plain. He suggests that Mexican traits were transmitted along this route by nonagricultural people of the Balcones phase during the course of their migra- tions to exploit seasonal concentrations of plant foods. In the other paper, Deric O'Bryan makes a closely reasoned survey of the theories that have been advanced to explain the abandonment of the northern Pueblos in the 13th century. He favors the hypothesis of nomad pressure, on the assumption that the Navaho were al- ready in the Southwest, pushing the Pueblo Indians southward, as early as the 12th century A.D. Volney Jones contributes an interesting paper, largely historical in nature, on the material from the Hemen- way expedition as a factor in establishing the American origin of the garden bean; and, finally, John Hall Moss discusses the antiquity of the Finley (Yuma) site from a geological standpoint. Moss's date of 7000 years ago, based upon climatic and glacial sequences, agrees nicely with the subsequent radiocarbon dates for the Horner and Long sites. There are 2 papers on South America which seem worth mentioning. In "Notes on Venezuelan Arche- ology" J. M. Cruxent describes recently discovered causeways, pot-holes, and stone walls, thus adding to the types of sites covered by Osgood and Howard in their survey of Venezuela. "Ancient Man in South America" by Theodore D. McCown provides both a succinct historical review of the problem and a critical evaluation of the most recent finds. Despite its pessi- mistic tone, this article shows clearly the advances that have been made since the author published his first review of the problem in American Antiquity in 1940. As a whole, the archaeological papers in this volume are inferior in number, if not in quality, to those in the first volume, on the Indian civilizations of America. In part, this may reflect the increasing interest of Amer- ican archaeologists during the past few years in the higher cultures, especially of the Andes, and in part it is probably due to the failure of our European col- leagues to pay much attention to the lower cultures, except in the Arctic area. IRVING ROUSE Yale University New Haven, Conn. Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Viru' Valley, Perii. GORDON R. WILLEY. Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 155, Washington, 1953. xxii+453 pp., 88 figs., 60 pls. $4.00. This volume is the fourth major report resulting from the 1946 Viru Valley Project of the Institute of Andean Research, having been preceded by monographs by Ford on the cultural dating of sites investigated, Bennett on the Gallinazo period, and Strong and Evans on the Formative and Florescent epochs. Thus the halfway mark has been reached in the publication of full reports by the 8-unit Project which had as its aim "a coordi- nated anthropological and geographical study of the human history of a single coastal valley in northern Peru." Willey's particular field of investigation on the Project was a study of settlement patterns in the Viru Valley throughout the course of its ascertainable prehistory, with objectives, in his words, First, to describe a series of prehistoric sites with reference to geographic and chronologic position; second, to outline a develop- mental reconstruction of these prehistoric settlements with rela- tion to function as well as sequence; third, to reconstruct cultural institutions insofar as these may be reflected in settlement con- figurations; and, fourth, to compare the settlement story of Viru with other regions of Peru. Willey credits Julian Steward with the initial impetus for this study, through the latter's "belief that arche- ology could best place itself in the position of contribu- ting to the interpretation of the nonmaterial and organ- izational aspects of prehistoric societies through a study of habitation and settlement types." Archaeological investigations with this particular focus and aim, on the scale of the Viru study, have been nonexistent in New World archaeology, and Willey, emphasizing the experimental nature of such a study, proceeds with care and discretion through this pioneering work. 297</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Field work for the settlement pattern study consisted of the investigation of a large sample of surface-exposed sites in the Virui Valley. Willey estimates that the 315 sites cataloged represent something less than 1/4 of all prehistoric cultural sites in the valley. Willey's work was carried out in close conjunction with that of Ford, the 2 units together comprising in a sense the Project's surface survey. After preliminary survey and mapping from aerial photographs, the 2 investigators visited each of the cataloged sites for more intensive study, Ford's task being the cultural dating of the sites primarily through his technique of seriational analysis of pottery collections from the surface, and Willey concentrating on settlement pattern and other habitation and archi- tectural features. Since all other archaeological units of the Viri Proj- ect restricted their investigations to the excavation of partial segments of the valley's prehistory, only the reports of Ford and Willey have the whole known pre- historic sequence of the valley as their purview. With Ford's report largely concerned with ceramic analysis and classification, the present volume by Willey, in its detailed architectural and settlement data supplemented by summary characterizations of each of the successive cultures in the valley's archaeological sequence, with an attempt at some degree of interpretation of the cultural processes involved, may be considered as the broadest in scope of any of the reports that have appeared or are yet to come, unless the tentative final synthetic report by all the members of the Project becomes a reality. The introductory chapter of the report is an exposi- tion of the methodology of the settlement pattern study. Here Willey gives a detailed description of the intensive use of aerial photographs by him and Ford in general orientation, location of sites, and site mapping. The work of the survey was immeasurably facilitated by this device. Many admirable field techniques at all stages of procedure were worked out by the Viru Valley Proj- ect, and this particular one might well serve as a model for future surface survey, settlement pattern, mapping, or other studies involving the cataloging and descrip- tion of sites, where aerial photographic coverage is avail- able. At the outset of investigation Willey considered sites as falling into 4 functional categories: 1) living sites, 2) community or ceremonial structures, 3) fortified strongholds, and 4) cemeteries. Public works such as canals and roads were regarded apart from these cate- gories, but described in connection with such sites as they were relatable to. As field work progressed and data accumulated, Willey then formulated various de- scriptive types and subtypes within the functional cate- gories: Scattered Small-house Village, Agglutinated Vil- lage, Compound Village, etc., within the living site category; Community Building, Pyramid Mound, etc., within the community and ceremonial structure cate- gory; and Hilltop Redoubt, Hilltop Platform, Castillo Fortification Complex, etc., in the fortified strongholds category. Dating, or rather cultural identification of sites, was almost exclusively by ceramic association; here Willey relied heavily on Ford's surface collection analyses. It is significant that even in a work of this type where the basic data investigated were architectural and settlement features, the ultimate reliance for cultural identification was on pottery, and, in fact, some of Willey's archi- tectural information was provided by ceramic reproduc- tions of house types. Of course, knowledge of Peruvian architectural data is as yet too scanty and unsystematic to allow their use as the major criterion for defining culture periods and their sequence, or even for the direct identification of sites, but there are also indica- tions in Willey's work that such features are not the sensitive registers of culture change that pottery is. Certainly settlement studies can eventually provide an- swers to a higher order of anthropological problems than ceramic analyses, but the evidence throughout Willey's work indicates that the spadework cannot be avoided. The first chapter concludes with a discussion of the problem of the cultural identification of sites investigated simply by surface survey, and the frequent difficulty of determining the original pottery-cultural association of these sites in a small area with large populations, a series of cultures, and 2000 years of ceramic develop- ment. These associational problems were such that Willey's final word on settlement study methodology is advice to future students to be prepared for at least some detailed excavation. The next chapter, "The Virui Valley: Environment and Inhabitants," gives a brief but comprehensive back- ground statement on geography, geology, climate, and present-day population, as well as a summary of the history of the valley since the conquest, and a concise descriptive outline of the prehistoric sequence of cul- tures that has been established through years of archae- ological investigation, culminating in the work of the Viru Valley Project. The chapter is an excellent pre- sentation of a variety of data on the valley, and con- cludes with an up-to-date consideration of radiocarbon and other estimated datings of the valley's archaeologi- cal sequence. The great bulk of the volume is taken up by the chapter "The Prehistoric Occupation of Virui," a de- tailed presentation of the data gathered on the 315 sites surveyed in the valley, provided with a large series of site maps, and arranged first by cultural period, and within the period by type and function. The chapter is a mine of information covering a practically complete developmental sequence of coastal Peruvian prehistoric architecture, and used in conjunction with the appendix listing the Virui sites in numerical order, the Peruvian specialist also has at hand an invaluable descriptive site catalog facilitating and complementing the study not only of the other unit reports of the Viru Valley Project, but those of previous investigators there as well. This section of Willey's work is the largest single body of scientific information on prehistoric Peruvian architec- ture and settlement patterning that exists in the litera- 298 [ XX, 3, 1955</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS ture, and is a great contribution on a subject heretofore neglected or at best haphazardly reported. Willey defines the next chapter, "The Development of Viriu Settlements: A Reconstruction," as the sum- mary of and conclusions from the settlement pattern data. It is largely a recasting of the basic data into narrative form, chronologically arranged, making clear the developmental trends in the various types of archi- tecture and their patterning throughout the valley's prehistory. In briefest outline, these trends were as follows: A few subterranean houses and villages of small conjoined rooms are the only architecture known from the very primitive and preceramic Cerro Prieto period, with nothing found that could be interpreted as ceremonial building or public works. In the succeeding Chavinoid Guafiape period in the valley, community or ceremonial buildings, simple temples or enclosures, are first found. Dwelling sites are of the scattered small house type. These Cerro Prieto and Guafiape period sites stick close to the beach, as one would expect from predominantly fish-subsisting cultures, although the in- troduction of maize in the Middle Guafiape subperiod allowed a move inland to some extent. The White-on- red Puerto Moorin period shows rather dramatic ad- vancement over the earlier cultures, with the introduc- tion of a number of features which remained basic to succeeding cultures in the valley--pyramid mounds, hilltop redoubt fortifications, agglutinated villages, the first clear indications of warfare, the. probable experi- mental beginnings of irrigation, and a major increase in population, evidenced by a much larger number of sites than previously. Willey's data on this little-known and unspectacular White-on-red period manifestation indi- cate an important role for that culture in the formation of patterns typifying later high cultures in Peru, and suggest the need for much more investigation of its nature and extent. The succeeding Gallinazo (Negative) period is the time of great development and working out of the forms adumbrated in the preceding Puerto Moorin period, the construction of vast irrigation systems, large agglutinated villages, great hilltop "castillo" fortifica- tions, and a continuing development of mounds, a long and stable period that Willey calls the "golden age" of Virui prehistory. The brief Huancaco (Mochica) period in the Virui Valley is the culmination of more or less autonomous regional development, the "Florescent" or "Classic" stage, artistically excellent, and with an extreme nationalistic quality. Although probably repre- senting an invasion into Viru from neighboring valleys, in architectural features and settlement patterning Hu- ancaco shows only a continuation of earlier traditions in the Virui Valley, and no great advancement over the Gallinazo forms. Following the Huancaco period, Willey found the sharpest break in the total developmental trend of cul- ture in the Viru Valley. With the Tomaval period, mound building, heretofore expressive of local politico- religious tradition since its inception in Puerto Moorin, -declines. The trend in dwelling sites, which had previ- ously been from small scattered houses into larger and larger agglutinations, alters into a quite different com- pound settlement type. The great "castillo" fortifica- tions, a development from the early simple Guafape hilltop platforms, and utilized in both Gallinazo and Huancaco times, are abandoned. Similarly, in ceramics a sharp stylistic break is found. Willey equates this interruption of relatively autochthonous local develop- ment by strikingly new forms with the Tiahuanaco spread over large portions of Peru, and the imposition of these new forms and traditions from the Highlands onto the Coast. Following the Tomaval period, the Viru Valley mani- festations of Chimu (La Plata) and Incaic (Estero) culture, in architecture and settlement patterning follow closely the lines of the Tiahuanacoid pattern, with no major new features in that valley. Although sites are fewer, and the Viru Valley seems to have become an unimportant backwater in these post-Tiahuanaco periods, the settlement data offer an indication that the Chimu and perhaps even Incaic periods owe a larger part of their heritage to forms laid down by the Tiahuanaco conquest than has been credited. Serving to set the stage for the next section, this chapter concludes with a discussion of community pat- terning, where Willey considers the distribution of sites in the valley in all periods, the grouping or clustering of individual sites, the growth of larger communities, orientation around ceremonial centers or "capitals," and the shifts in population concentrations from one part of the valley to another from time to time. These fea- tures are graphically illustrated with a series of maps. The chapter "Settlements and Society" is what Willey calls an "inferential essay," wherein he inter- prets the data previously presented to deduce facts of population size and growth through successive periods in the Viru Valley, with an attempt at explanation of growth and the movement of population concentrations through time in terms of a developing irrigation tech- nology, defense requirements, and the maximum sup- port potential of the valley. Also considered are certain sociopolitical phenomena suggested by the data, prin- cipally the governmental forms implied by the necessity for social control in the construction of large irrigation projects, and cities in the nature of ceremonial centers or "capitals." Willey's inferences are cautiously stated and unexceptionable. However, although the chapter is the only interpretive section in the volume, it is very brief, and in view of Willey's avowed objective of cul- tural reconstructions, has a parsimonious quality. For such a wealth of data, the inferences drawn as to the nonmaterial aspects of the societies represented are quite few and curiously restricted. For example, the field of social organization is notably untouched. Also one feels particularly that the order of phenomena here investigated by Willey, with their patent implications for the reconstruction of economic, social, political, and religious institutions, would lend itself well to the fuller 299</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY appreciation and support (or denial) of the several functional-developmental or evolutionary schemes post- ulated in recent years for the prehistoric culture se- quences of the Andean region, but Willey barely relates either his data or interpretations, if at all, to those schemes. On the other hand, this kind of criticism is only indicative of the great value of the work in presenting a large body of data of a new kind in Peruvian archae- ology, which opens the possibilities of a much more penetrating understanding of cultural institutions and processes in the Andean area. Willey pleads that the study is experimental, and it is perhaps with that cau- tion in mind that he has refrained from extensive infer- ence or speculation in this first work of its kind. The final chapter, "The Viru Valley in Peruvian Pre- history," places the settlement pattern data in Virui in relation to the rest of the country. The chapter amounts to a summary of the present knowledge of Peruvian prehistoric architecture, very valuable in itself, and serves not least to point up that the present work is unique in the advancement of knowledge of this phase of Peruvian archaeology. The work is excellently organized, with careful cross- referencing, summaries and recapitulations at all stages of presentation, and a wealth of site and valley maps. A series of plates, indifferently reproduced, illustrates the major architectural types in the valley. ROBERT STIGLER Columbia University New York, N.Y. The Civilization of the Maya. J. ERIC S. THOMPSON. Chicago Naturar History Museum, Popular Series, An- thropology, No. 25, 5th edition, Chicago, 1953. 96 pp. $.75. This is the fifth edition of a well-known handbook, first published in 1927. In accord with Museum policy the text has been revised for the most part, rather than entirely rewritten. I have compared this edition with the second edition, published in 1932. The general appearance of the handbook has been considerably improved, and the use of calendered paper has allowed the illustrations to be included in the body of the text. Changes and additions to the illustrations have provided a well-chosen coverage. The apportioning of space by subject matter has been scarcely changed; the greater part of the handbook is based on docu- mentary and ethnographic material. Archaeological dis- coveries have necessitated a rewriting of the historical account (12 pp.), Thompson's recent work on Maya hieroglyphics (Maya Hieroglyphic Writing: Introduction, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1950) must have suggested the rewriting of his chapter on religion (11 pp.). The other sections of the book show minor changes and additions which give evidence of careful and complete revision. The text is up to date. The author cannot be fairly criticized for faults in relative emphasis of subject material in a text which has not been completely rewritten for 26 years. In general the text seems to me long on mythological and episodic account, short on culture history, settlement patterning, economy, and on material culture in general. There has also been little effort to dissect historical develop- ments from the intricate mass of religious myth and ritual which characterized the conquest period. That these materials represent the results of Mexican main- land influence on the Classic-stage Maya is unques- tioned, and Thompson has long held a leading position in efforts to unravel this tangle. The Civilization of the Mayas can be recommended as a good first reading on the subject. Thompson's recent volume on the Maya (The Rise and Fall of the Maya Civilization, University of Oklahoma Press), gives a clearer view of his present interests and ap- proach. GEORGE W.
