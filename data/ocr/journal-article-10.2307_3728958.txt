<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDRE GIDE, E. M. FORSTER, AND G. LOWES DICKINSON Reviewing E. M. Forster's posthumous novel Maurice on its appearance in 1971 Cyril Connolly observed: 'Forster is closer to Gide than is any other English writer.'1 We may wonder whether this is in the strictest sense true but the two men undoubtedly shared a number of preoccupations and values, and it is no surprise to find Forster showing considerable respect for Gide when he came to survey the latter's career as writer and 'thinker'.2 There are two short pieces in which he does this. Both are collected in Two Cheersfor Democracy. Although they are well known, they provide a convenient starting-point for a study of the circumstances which brought the two men together.3 The first, entitled 'Gide and George', is a version of a talk Forster gave on the BBC's Eastern Service in I943. In this talk Gide and Stefan George are seen as neatly illustrating 'two contrasted reactions in this age of misery: the humanist's reaction and the authoritarian's', and Forster's sole purpose in his brief remarks is to stress the crucial importance, as he sees it, of Gide's position as a humanist. The humanist, Forster claims, possesses four principal characteristics, all of which are present in his French subject: 'curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race'. In illustration of his claim, he cites among other things, Gide's refusal to collaborate in any way with the Nazi invader, his fascination with the contradictions within both himself and others, his readiness to question causes he had previously adopted with enthusiasm, and, perhaps most interestingly one might think, what Forster calls '[Gide's] total lack of cynicism with regard to the human race'. . Forster's second essay on Gide - which in Two Cheersfor Democracy is given the title 'Gide's Death' - was originally published in I951 as a letter to The Listener. Once again, it is to the humanist that Forster is drawn. 'Gide', he says, 'is the humanist of our age.' He is ready to admit that Gide did not possess a great mind, but he goes on to say: 'He had a free mind, and free minds are as rare as great, and even more valuable at the present moment.' Such a mind, fascinated by life's complexity, 'has taught thousands of people to mistrust facades, to call the bluff, to be brave without bounce and inconsistent without frivolity'. On the other hand, Forster was well aware of the concomitant weaknesses in Gide's intellectual habits. In 'Gide and George', he concedes that if Gide is 'subtle' and 'elusive', he is 'sometimes annoyingly so'. Or, as he puts it in his later piece, 'as slippery as a trout'. The note adopted throughout these short essays is one of high moral seriousness. For all that, it is tempting to detect a streak of wistfulness when Forster emphasizes what he saw as Gide's contentment, and adds, 'I realized ... how much he had got out of life'. 1 'Corydon in Croydon', Sunday Times ( I October I97 ), reprinted in E. M. Forster: The Critical Heritage, edited by Philip Gardner (London and Boston, 1973), pp. 458-6i. 2 According toJ. R. Ackerley, Forster 'wept to hear of the death ofAndre Gide, not for personal reasons, he knew him only slightly, but because he felt that one of the few great props of his own civilization had been withdrawn'. This passage, written as part of Ackerley's obituary of Forster for The Observer was omitted from the published version (The Letters ofJ. R. Ackerley, edited by Neville Braybrooke (London, 1975), p. 319, n. 5). Ackerley, like Connolly, felt Forster and Gide to be kindred writers. He kept a pet sparrow in his flat and, as he said in a letter to David Sylvester: 'It sleeps in my bookshelf on the works of Morgan and Andre Gide' (p. 216). 3 See Two Cheersfor Democracy, Abinger edition (London, I972).</page><page sequence="2">Gide, Forster, and Dickinson As Forster himself states in 'Gide's Death', he never knew Gide well, but they corresponded from time to time. It might seem surprising that they did not become firmer acquaintances or enter into a more frequent exchange of letters. Gide was, after all, an indefatigable letter-writer who assiduously maintained contact with English literary and intellectual circles. There is, however, more to say about the connexions between the two men than existing biographies suggest. We are helped in this by a handful of their unpublished letters deposited in Cambridge and Paris, by a brief correspondence - also unpublished - between Gide and the then celebrated King's don, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson,4 and, to a lesser extent, by the recent publication of Gide's letters to his passionate admirer, Dorothy Bussy.5 The first letter in the extant correspondence between Gide and Forster is from Gide. Dated 29 September 1920, it is in reply to a letter of invitation that seems not to have survived and which was written after Gide had spent part of the summer in England and Wales: Nouvelle Revue Fran(aise, 35 rue Madame, Paris VIe Cher Monsieur, J'ai bien requ votre lettre, mais trop tard, helas, pour me rendre a votre aimable invitation. Deja j'avais quitte l'Angleterre; mais croyez bien que je ne retournerai pas a Londres sans venir frapper a votre porte. J'ai eu le grand plaisir de voir Lowes Dickinson avant son depart; lui ai confie un livre, le priant de bien vouloir vous le preter apres qu'il en aurait lui-meme pris connaissance. Veuillez croire a mes sentiments bien cordiaux Andre Gide6 Although, because of a printer's strike, Gide was only now distributing copies of La Symphonie Pastorale (for example to Edmund Gosse, Arnold Bennett, and, as will be seen, Lowes Dickinson), the work to which he refers in this letter was, as is made clear by one of Dickinson's letters quoted below, his dialogue in defence of homosexuality, Corydon, a volume he was then showing to selected friends and sympathizers, together with the original version of his autobiography Si le grain ne meurt. This was the second edition of Corydon, only twenty-one copies of which had been published, hors commerce and bearing the name of neither author nor publisher, just that of a printing firm in Bruges.7 A degree of circumspection had been felt necessary; Gide remarked to Dorothy Bussy that Corydon was a work capable of 4 All unpublished letters appear here with the kind permission of the holders of copyright.

The printer, Verbeke, who had produced some of the earlier issues of the Nouvelle Revue Francaise, La Symphonie Pastorale, and Numquid et tu, was chosen for his discretion. He had, in 1911 , also been responsible for producing, in a limited edition of ten copies, the first, shorter version of Corydon. The commercial edition, published by the NRF, was to appear only in 1924. By this time Forster had already written Maurice, and Dickinson, who admired his friend's homosexual novel and had known Gide since the summer of 1918, had presumably mentioned to Gide the interest Forster shared with them in homo- sexuality, if not the work itself. At this stage, Forster and Gide were not personally acquainted, although the latter had made several trips to England. Forster, it should be remembered, was in Alexandria throughout Gide's long visit to England during the summer and autumn of 1918 but, encouraged no doubt by Dickinson, had already taken a keen interest in Gide's work. Not long before, on 7 June i919, there had appeared in the Liberal Daily News his review of Lady Rothermere's undistinguished translation of Le Promethee mal enchazne' (see appendix, p. 831). Promethee was not much to Forster's taste and he warned readers of the Daily News that it was not one of Gide's best books, the basic idea being not 'well worked out'. He was also quick to emphasize what he was always willing to see as Gide's fundamental weakness as a writer: the latter's 'butterfly mind' and lack of staying-power. (Forster's criticism of Lady Rothermere's translation would not, incidentally, have brought him any enemies from the owners of a newspaper which was outside the Harmsworth empire.) But he reveals his familiarity with the rest of Gide's work when he urges his readers to turn instead to Les Caves du Vatican, La Porte Etroite, and Isabelle; we can only speculate as to why L'lmmoraliste does not feature in his list. This familiarity with Gide's work is further illustrated in February 1920 when, in reply to his friend Robert Trevelyan, who had announced his intention of writing a novel, he selects Les Caves du Vatican as one of two works Trevelyan might follow, though his thinking about 'realism' in the novel seems, to say the least, equivocal: 'Did you read, and having read admire, Norman Douglas's South Wind? That, and Gide's Les Caves du Vatican, strike me as a possible line of development. I see no end (in both senses of the word) to realistic stuff. All the same I advise you to try to be realistic!'8 Forster and Gide continued to exchange letters in the autumn and winter of 1920 but before their relationship is considered further, it is helpful to examine in some detail Gide's acquaintance with Lowes Dickinson. It was, as has been seen, through Lowes Dickinson that Gide first came into contact with Forster. Gide considered that Dickinson was one of the most interesting Englishmen he had met during his long stay in England in the summer of I918. In the letter he wrote to Dorothy Bussy in June 1920 announcing his intention of once more spending part of the summer in England, Dickinson is singled out as the person he wishes to meet again. It was through Dorothy Bussy that he had been introduced to Dickinson (Gide-Bussy, I, pp. 19I, I2I). A Strachey, she knew all the dominant Cambridge and Bloomsbury personalities of the time. Gide would, all the same, have been aware of Dickinson's existence through other friends and acquaintances. 8 This letter was first published in Selected Letters ofE. M. Forster, i, i879-I920, edited by Mary Lago and P. N. Furbank (London, 1983), p.314 (hereafter Lago-Furbank). The MS is in Trinity College, Cambridge. I have restored the exclamation mark which Forster placed after the second 'realistic'. 8I9</page><page sequence="4">820 Gide, Forster, and Dickinson Jacques Raverat, for example, who made many of the arrangements for Gide's stay in Cambridge in 1918, had known Dickinson for some time, though during the war he had kept his distance from the pacifist circles in which Dickinson moved. (A letter he wrote to Gide in February 1920 announces that he had been renewing contact with this milieu: 'Dickinson est charmant', he adds, 'mais les autres! ...' An unpublished letter from Dickinson to Roger Fry, dated 31 October I920, includes the statement, 'Jacques Raverat is at Vence, on the Riviera, and wants me to join him'.)9 Another go-between, if one had still been needed, would have been the artist and art-historian, Auguste Breal, son of the distinguished linguist and professor at the College de France, Michel Breal. Breal had been a contemporary of Gide and Pierre Loujs at the Ecole Alsacienne. Dickinson and he had been friends since I893, when he spent two terms at Christ's College reading for the Diploma of the School of Oriental Languages.10 An unpublished letter from Dickinson to Roger Fry, written on 29January 1893, records their meeting: I had a frenchman to breakfast whom I had never met before, &amp; Russel [Lord Russell] would do nothing but rot Withers &amp; stop all conversation. However the frenchman stayed till i. He is here for two terms to learn Indian languages, &amp; is very attractive; keen about music and literature &amp; knows Verlaine and Maupassant &amp;c. His name is Breal. If you come up p'raps you shall see him .... My outer room is really lovely. Breal said the colours must have been designed by an artist. He lives among artists in Paris; and said the 'tones' of your Failand sketch were good. Breal was also a friend of Simon Bussy, like himself a painter; Dorothy Bussy had translated his study of Velasquez, and it was he who furnished Gide with an introduction to the Bussys.11 Though, once again, this was hardly necessary, since Dorothy would have been well known to the Raverats,Jacques's wife Gwen having been a Miss Darwin. It may also have been the case that it was Breal who had introduced Gide toJacques Raverat in the first place.12 Dickinson, like many dons at that time, spent the vacations away from Cambridge and was, at least in principle, not in residence during Gide's sojourn in the Long Vacation of 1918. As Forster recorded in his biography of Dickinson: Except for two visits, to Holland, and to America, he remained in England during the war, and as much as possible in London. There he had the sympathy of his sisters, and could sometimes see the friend from whom he was never alienated - Roger Fry. Cambridge only increased his sadness. All that he cared for and worked for had vanished, and a grim obscene power took its place.13 As a result, Dickinson offered Gide the use of his rooms in King's. Gide subsequently claimed that the College Council had been opposed to such an arrangement, and 9 The Raverat letters quoted here are to be found in the Bibliotheque Doucet. Those from Dickinson to Fry are at King's. 10 Letters ofRoger Fry, edited by Denys Sutton, 2 vols (London, 1972), I, 704, incorrectly states that Breal held a Research Fellowship at Christ's College in the year 1887-88. My information on Breal is based on J. A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, Part ii, Vol. I (Cambridge, 1940), andJohn Peile, Biographical Register of Christ's College I505-I905, Vol. ii (Cambridge, I913). 11 See Dorothy Bussy, 'Quelques souvenirs' in Hommage a Andre Gide, special number of the Nouvelle Revue Franfaise (November 195I), p. 37. 12 See Tedeschi's remarks in Gide-Bussy, I, 90. It might be added that Dickinson and Arnold Bennett (Gide's correspondent since I91 I) were both members of The Writers Group. 13 E. M. Forster, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson and Related Writings, Abinger edition (London, 1973), p. 34. See also The Autobiography of G. Lowes Dickinson and Other Unpublished Writings, edited by Dennis Proctor (London, 1973), p. 196, and N. Wedd, 'Goldie Dickinson: The Latest Cambridge Platonist', Criterion, 12, no. 47 (January I933), I75-83 (p. I76).</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL TILBY this caused him to wonder whether his presence was considered undesirable on account of his own literary production or because of the reputation of his uncle (the economist and advocate of cooperativism, Charles Gide).14 The College records contain no mention of such a decision but it seems probable that, as so often in such situations, the victim was seeking refuge in an over-dramatic explanation. It is likely that the College was simply unhappy about a foreigner (or merely an outsider) occupying a Fellow's rooms in the absence of his host. The idea of living in King's clearly appealed to Gide. (In a letter to Jacques-Emile Blanche, he wrote: 'On m'offre un appartement merveilleux a King's College maisj'attends pour y pouvoir entrer l'autorisation du Prevost qui ne doit revenir a Cambridge que demain.')15 He had, it seems, written to Raverat telling him of the difficulties Dickinson's proposal was encountering, for the letter he received from Raverat on i August contained the comment: 'J'espere que vous finirez par trouver une solution pour l'appartement de Dickinson. Peut-etre lui-meme pourra-t-il vous aider s'il vient a Cambridge?' Whatever attempts were made to secure the necessary permission, two things are clear. First, Gide did not occupy Dickinson's rooms but instead, after a brief stay in Grantchester, went to live in Merton House in Queens Road, a property recently acquired by one of the Apostles, H. T.J. Norton. (Norton had already shown his generous nature in putting up the money for the publication of Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians.) Secondly, Gide and Dickinson did meet during the summer of 1918 (Gide-Bussy, I, pp. I20-2 I), though whether it was in Cambridge or London, we do not know. We can imagine that the two men had much of mutual interest to discuss. Dickinson's chief preoccupation at this time was with World Peace and the linking of nations. He worked steadfastly for the League of Nations, a body which, it has often been recognized, owed its birth very largely to his idealism. Gide, likewise, was becoming increasingly concerned with the future of the civilized world and we may assume that he and Dickinson welcomed the opportunity to exchange ideas on this most crucial of subjects. At the same time, Dickinson was always fascinated by the precise make-up of other homosexuals. (Thus, in letters to Roger Fry, we find him saying of Samuel Butler, on whom Forster had once planned to write a book: 'What interests me is to find that he had (emotionally) the homogenic temperament, though sexually he appears to have satisfied himself with women'; and on the death of an acquaintance: 'He had a nonsexual ideal passion for men, but sexually only for women. Gide is the opposite case as you know.') Yet it is impossible on the basis of the available evidence to know just how much was said at the meeting or meetings between them in 1918. A letter Dickinson wrote two years later suggests that it was only then that the two men had begun to talk on intimate terms. What is certain is that in the summer of 1920 Gide sent Dickinson a copy of La Symphonie pastorale, the recit he had been endeavouring to complete during his stay in England in 9 i 8. Dickinson wrote him a letter of thanks from King's on I 4 August: 14 'Dickinson m'avait aimablement invite a profiter de son appartement a King's; mais ma litterature ou la mauvaise reputation (bien immerit6e) de mon oncle m'a fait refuser par le conseil du college' (extract from a letter of i August 19 8 to an unidentified friend, quoted in the Bulletin des Amis d'Andre Gide, 27 (July I975),,59. 15 J.-E. Blanche, Nouvelles Lettres a Andre Gide (I89g-z925), edited by Georges-Paul Collet (Geneva, 1982), pp. 138-39. Gide's letter is dated 26July I918. The Provost at this time was M. R.James. 82 I</page><page sequence="6">822 Gide, Forster, and Dickinson My dear Gide, Very many thanks for sending me your Symphonie pastorale. I have read it - I do not know whether I ought to say with complete appreciation, for that is only possible to those to whom french is a native tongue, but certainly with much admiration for its beauty and tenderness. And I value the compliment you pay me in presenting it to me. It is possible I may be in Paris in the course of the autumn or winter and if so I should like to see you. I believe I once had your address, but I have it not by me, so must send this to your publishers. Thanking you once more for your book, and the gift of it I am Yours very truly G. Lowes Dickinson16 Gide was then holidaying in Snowdonia with the young Marc Allegret but, as can be seen from the letter he wrote to Forster, he did succeed in meeting Dickinson again, towards the end of his visit that summer. Not only did he on that occasion give Dickinson Corydon to read, he also presented him with a copy of the limited edition of Si le grain ne meurt, and it was at this meeting that their conversation seems to have blossomed. Writing on 15 September from his favourite prewar haunt in the Engadine, Sils Maria, Dickinson confided to Roger Fry the effect this meeting had had on him and in particular he mentioned his desire, in the wake of his reading of Corydon, to write his own dialogue on sexual love: If I could get peace of mind, I would try my hand at a dialogue on oQwo - Gide has lent me his, on homosexuality. But though it is better than anything else done on the subject, it does not satisfy me. We tumbled into a curious &amp; perhaps premature intimacy in an hour's talk. I don't know whether it will maintain itself. It seems that Dickinson did achieve that peace of mind. 'Body and Soul. A Dialogue', which Dennis Proctor attributes to the years 1928-29, is, Proctor says, 'a dialogue in which th[e] two contestants rehearse all the episodes of his sexual history in terms of the conflicts which have taken place between them' (Proctor, p. 20; see also pp. 271-83). Five days before Dickinson's letter to Fry and shortly before Gide wrote to Forster the letter with which I began, Dickinson had written to Gide at length, divulging his impressions of Corydon and, to a lesser extent, those he had formed of the auto- biography: Sils Maria Sept. io 1920 Dear Gide, I have read 'Corydon' and of course with great interest. But I find it very hard to reply to your question, whether, in my judgment, it has r6ussi. I am perhaps unduly pessimistic about the possibility of getting the 'normal' man to consider this question seriously and dispassionately. Which means, that I doubt anything succeeding with him. But he is the man one wants to get at, for it is no use our converting one another. However, that perhaps is not what you were thinking of. So I will merely put together some impressions of my own. I am interested in the biological aspect; yet I thought that section rather tedious in parts, and long out of proportion to the rest of the book. That is, no doubt, because I think (as I believe you do) that it is not easy to draw any conclusions from 'nature' to human conduct. It is certainly an astonishing fact that nature should be so unprecise in regard to an instinct which is commonly thought to have reproduction for its main purpose. Or perhaps I should say (since it may be mere anthropomorphism to impute purpose to nature) an instinct so necessary to the continuation 16 The letters from Dickinson to Gide are now in the Bibliotheque Doucet. They are typewritten and I have corrected the obvious typing errors.</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL TILBY oflife. Your theory of course is that the instinct is unprecise because, in fact, it has an additional purpose that ofluxe or art. That idea interests me too, and I should suppose it may be seminal and fruitful in biology. But I doubt its direct applicability to our question. Some one might argue thus: 'nature no doubt goes blundering about, but what she's really up to, is to make the instinct precise and concentrate it exclusively on reproduction. She manages this in some cases, in the animal world. In the human world, it is our business to assist her by our institutions etc. We should, therefore, do all we can to concentrate love on marriage, thus fulfilling nature's ultimate purpose.' I should not find that convincing. But I doubt the convincingness of any argument from nature to morals. Such arguments seem to me to have the value ofrhetoric rather than demonstration. I conclude that the other chapters ofyour book are the more important for your apologia. And here, putting myself in the position of the antagonist, there are some points I would like to see dealt with more fully. Your antagonist, I think, would bring up against your reminder of heroic male love, its accompaniment of male prostitution. He would say that the admission of the one opens the door to the other, and that the price is too high to pay. He would further inquire pressingly whether a removal of the social stigma, so that boys and youths could become avowed 'eromenoi ' of elder 'erastai' might not distract them permanently from heterosexual love, and marriage. From what I have myself been able to observe, it need not. But I don't think you deal with the point, which seems important. I am putting myselfin the position of advocatus diaboli, which indeed one must do, if one is to convince the devil. And we have to convince, not the devil, but most good men. There is another point you do not touch upon - the place, good, bad or indifferent of what you call 'mauvaises habitudes'. Mark Twain, I was told once made a public speech (at some dinner) on that theme. 'Queen Elizabeth' he said 'defended it as the protection of virginity!'. Where sex is thwarted in love it is a possible pis aller. And perhaps our 'good men' will say it is one we ought to be content with. I am anything but satisfied with what I have written, for indeed the subject does not lend itself to writing about. But I wanted to give some sort of indication why I think that your book might be revised and amplified, before you think of publication. You will perhaps think all this very stupid, but it is my reaction on a first reading. There is another point, perhaps not very important. But I think that if your interlocutor were a more sympathetic character the book would gain. One feels that he damages his cause by his crassness and brutality (those words are more crass and brutal than they should be) and that, in that way, the principal speaker has an unfair advantage. I have also read more than half the autobiography, and with great interest and admiration. Perhaps, in one or two places, it is a little tedious to the reader, who for example may not be an entomologist (I am not, and should like to be). But I find it very beautiful and real, and you get round the difficult corners wonderfully. Only one important passage, where you find Madeleine crying, leaves me puzzled. What was it all about? Are we not to know? or have you said, and I stupidly failed to hear?- We have had good weather so far, and I find the cowbells the streams and the lakes very touching and beautiful. It so happens that much ofthe romance of my life centres round this place, and round the people with whom I am staying. But only ghosts remain, beautiful ghosts. We shall meet again, I hope, before too long, for it is better to talk than to write. I can but hope I have said nothing to annoy or irritate you. Yours very truly G. Lowes Dickinson Dickinson's letter is in many ways the most interesting response to the second edition of Corydon so far available. Gide had apparently been uncertain of the way Dickinson would react to the work (Gide-Bussy, I, p. 199), but we learn from Maria van Rysselberghe's Cahiers de la Petite Dame that Dickinson's careful and intelligent reading of the dialogues brought Gide considerable satisfaction: 'Le soir, gros courrier: lettre de Bennett, lettre de Dickinson, a qui il a donne Corydon. Gide trouve son appreciation interessante, et sijoliment exprimee' (Cahiers Andre Gide, 4, p. 46). In contrast, Dorothy Bussy was lavish in her praise, claiming that although she had found Corydon a demanding work, the reward for her pains had been immense (Gide- Bussy, I, pp. 199-200, I August 1920). Much of her letter on the subject is taken up in 823</page><page sequence="8">Gide, Farster, and Dickinson a self-gratifying emphasis on her own open-mindedness and the lack of prejudice to be found in certain women with regard to subjects that are taboo. (She ends up, however, wanting to know the answer to a question Gide had failed to pose, namely: 'What are the real reasons for homosexuality being so widely condemned?') Martin du Gard, on the other hand, like Dickinson, was more critical. He made no secret of the fact that he found Corydon overly detached and impersonal.17 But his written comments are much less detailed than Dickinson's. He stresses his disapproval of Gide's choice of form and urges him to treat the subject in a novel or play: 'Faites de votre passion une oeuvre d'art, emouvante et profonde, atteignez le troublant probleme au coeur meme des faits, des sentiments.' Dickinson's brief remarks on Si le grain ne meurt again reveal a precise response to specific features of the book. By contrast, Dorothy Bussy embroiders upon her theme that the autobiography has left her 'dans un etat d'excitation indescriptible' (Gide- Bussy, I, p. 203). Martin du Gard, like Arnold Bennett and Leon-Paul Fargue after him, believed that Si le grain ne meurt was Gide's best work to date. Yet he still declared himself unsatisfied, since the book did not, he felt, fully express the genius the author displayed in his life: 'Il faut que le genie s'y eploie en totalite' (Gide-Martin du Gard, I, p. I58). So much however for the potentially rewarding friendship between Gide and Dickinson. We may assume that Gide replied to Dickinson but his letter is not among the papers of Dickinson's to have survived. There is, to my knowledge, no evidence, either, of the two men remaining in contact during the twelve years Dickinson still had to live. This having been said, I now return to Forster, and his correspondence with Gide in the closing months of 1920. It would have been interesting to know Forster's detailed response to Corydon. It is clear from a letter Gide wrote to Forster on 17 December I920 that the latter had written to him again that autumn, enclosing a copy of The Longest journey and commenting on Corydon. But, like the earlier letter, it seems not to have survived. This, on the other hand, is what Gide said in his reply: Cher Monsieur, Votre 'Longest journey' est sur ma table; etj'attendais de l'avoir lu pour vous ecrire; mais un inattendu surcroit de travail me force de remettre ce plaisir - etje ne veux pas attendre plus longtemps pour vous dire tout le plaisir que m'a apporte votre aimable lettre, et ce que vous me dites au sujet de mon petit livre. Etje crois parfaitement juste [4 or 5 words crossed out] votre crainte que la forme dialoguee, ait souvent plutot nui qu'aide6 l'etablissment de mes id6es .... Le livre dont vous me parlez, ce livre de vous que vous souhaitez queje connaisse-- et que, de mon c6te,je souhaite vivement connaitre - n'est pas the longest journey, n'est-ce pas? Mais comment me le procurer? Croyez bien cher monsieur que le desir de faire votre connaissance ajoute un attrait de plus au voyage en Angleterre - mais je ne sais quand je pourrai y retourner. Vous-meme, ne venez-vous jamais en France. Soyez assure de ma bien attentive sympathie. Andre Gide Forster's reply, written on 22 December from Harnham, his house in Weybridge, is the only letter of his to Gide that exists in the Fonds Gide of the Bibliotheque litteraireJacques Doucet in Paris. Gide's attempt to draw Forster out on the subject 17 Andre Gide-Roger Martin du Gard, Correspondance, 2 vols (Paris, 1968), I, 156-57 (hereafter Gide- Martin du Gard). (Compare the remarks of Delay, pp. 66-67.) 824</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL TILBY of his own clandestine work - which we now know to be Maurice - meets with only limited success. Forster is characteristically reticent: Dear Monsieur Gide, I was so pleased to get your letter, and to learn that one of my books was in your hands. The novel that I particularly want you to read has not been published. Only a few friends know about it (and I ask them to be so good as not to speak about it to others). There is at present only one complete copy (in typescript) so I cannot risk it much in the post. When you come to England - I do hope you will! - I will inflict it on you; or if I get it duplicated, I will send it to France. Myself I am seldom in Paris, but if your Saul is performed, I promise myself the trip: Duncan Grant told me of his hopes, and I have lately read the play - with the greatest admiration - I thought it a wonderful play. Yours sincerely, E. M. Forster Gide's current interest in the theatre, as he explains in Si le grain ne meurt, was of recent origin, having very largely been kindled by the work ofJacques Copeau at the Vieux Colombier. Copeau had for some time been talking of putting on Gide's play Sail, but the venture was the subject of more than one postponement. Not untilJune 1922 was it eventually staged, with Copeau andJouvet in the principal roles.18 For all Forster's enthusiasm for this early work, and that of Martin du Gard, who had, Gide claimed, led him to rediscover it (Gide-Martin du Gard, I, p. 182, n. 2), the production was badly received. In the absence of indications to the contrary, we should assume that Forster was not present. Nor is any mention to be found of Gide being given the opportunity of reading Maurice.19 Forster was already uneasy about the way knowledge of his clandestine novel had spread. To Robert Trevelyan he wrote (only months before this exchange of letters with Gide): 'I do not want news to get into quarters where it may do me harm. As it is, it's known of where I would much rather it was not known.' This latter remark is glossed by Lago and Furbank as follows: 'possibly Garsington Manor, with its free-flowing gossip, and Lady Ottoline Morrell's impulsive manipulations of her friends' friendships' (Lago- Furbank, pp. 314-I5). It was, he wrote to Florence Barger, only as a result of Trevelyan's 'importunacy' that he agreed to send him the sensitive typescript (Lago-Furbank, p. 315). Forster was not however to forget Gide.20 Indeed his most celebrated references to the French writer occur in the widely-read and often-quoted Clark Lectures of 1927, which were published under the appropriately modest title Aspects of the Novel. What he had to say in these lectures about Les Faux-Monnayeurs, however inadequate it may now seem, played an important part in securing for that work a prominent position in English critical thinking about the contemporary novel. And this was in spite of the fact that, as P. N. Furbank has pointed out, some English writers at any rate were 18 For references to the preparations for Sail, see Cahiers Andre Gide, 4, p. I26-27, and Gide's letters to E.-R. Curtius in Deutsch-franzisische Gespriche I920-I950, edited by Herbert and Jane M. Dieckmann (Frankfurt, I980). 19 As the Lago-Furbank selection shows, a select number of friends presumed to be sympathetic to Forster's views in Maurice had been given the chance to read the novel, beginning with Dickinson, Keynes, and Provost Sheppard of King's in I914. The other known readers of the typescript were Edward Carpenter, Edward Dent, Florence Barger, Hugh Meredith, Robert and Elizabeth Trevelyan, and Siegfried Sassoon, to whom should probably be added George Barger and Wilhelm Spohr. 20 Forster was drawn by William Rothenstein c. I92I (see the dust-jacket to Lago and Furbank). It is likely that Rothenstein, who had been one of Gide's hosts in 1918, would have talked of Gide with his sitter. 825</page><page sequence="10">Gide, Forster, and Dickinson disappointed when they went to read the novel for themselves.21 Nor was Forster himself without reservations. On 19 November 1926 he is to be found writing to Virginia Woolf: 'Les Faux-Monnayeurs proves not to be a new sort of novel after all - only the throwing-up of an old sponge. There is no punch or colour in it - only more and more interesting, most most interesting' (Furbank, II, p. I44). It was, rather, Si le grain ne meurt which impressed both the writer of this letter and its recipient; on Christmas Day 1926, Virginia Woolf informed Vita Sackville-West: 'Gides memoirs which I read voraciously renew the sense that I can read with pleasure.'22 It is perhaps strange, in view of the endeavour by Gide, du Bos, and others to make certain that Paul Desjardins's famous Decades at the Abbaye de Pontigny were truly international gatherings, that Forster was never one of the English intellectuals present. (Nor, as far as I can ascertain, did Dickinson ever attend.) Yet it was another international event, albeit one on a much larger scale, which brought Forster into contact once again with Gide, namely, the International Congress of Writers for the Defence of Culture against Fascism, which Gide, together with Malraux and other left-wing writers, organized in June I935 at the vast Palais de la Mutualite in Paris. Two hundred writers attended from fifteen countries. Forster, as is well known, headed the English delegation, which included John Strachey and Aldous Huxley. The English writers formed a striking contrast with the continental delegations, which were predominantly Communist in sympathy.23 As Forster wrote in an article on the Congress he contributed to the New Statesman: 'I was warned before arrival that, though the Congress was advertised as non-party, the preponderant element in it would be Communist. This proved perfectly correct, and being vaguely liberal, I should have preferred the preponderance to be liberal.'24 The Congress lasted more than a week, throughout which time the Palais de la Mutualite was packed - the audience was estimated at five thousand - the speeches being relayed through loudspeakers to those outside. Gide was at this time still thoroughly persuaded of the rightness of Communism. (The credit for his 'conversion', Gustav Regler recorded,25 was taken by Aragon, though in fact Gide was never a card-carrying member.) As Ilya Ehrenburg, one of the Congress organizers, recalled in his memoirs, 'Gide was the idol of the Western 21 P. N. Furbank, E. M. Forster: A Life, 2 vols (London, I977-78), II, 178. Furbank mentions by name Christopher Isherwood and the latter's Cambridge friend, Edward Upward. 22 The Letters of Virginia Woolf, edited by Nigel Nicolson andJoanne Trautman, 6 vols (London, 1975-80), III, 309 (compare VI, 368, and Furbank, II, 195). Virginia Woolf's correspondence also makes clear her admiration for Gide's Journal. 23 In his recent study, Andre Gide et I'URSS (Berne, I983), Rudolf Maurer has rightly observed: 'La delegation de la Grande-Bretagne n'etait pas sans lacunes .. ., avec l'absence de SHAW et des WEBB.' But, as David Caute has pointed out, 'the prevailing mood was of course that of the democratic alliance, and the star-performances were carefully reserved for fellow-travellers' (The Fellow-Travellers. A Postscript to the Enlightenment (London, 1973), p. 142). See also the same author's Communism and the French Intellectuals (London, 1964), pp. 15-I6. 24 New Statesman, 6 July 1935. Forster's understatement forms a curious contrast with the mixture of anger and disappointment registered by Huxley (see his letter to Victoria Ocampo, Letters of Aldous Huxley, edited by Grover Smith (London, 1969), pp. 396-97). Huxley also wrote to Gide; his views were summarized by Mme van Rysselberghe thus: 'Huxley deplore que ce Congres n'ait ete au fond qu'une longue parlote un peu vaine sans qu'on ait pris le temps d'aborder, de discuter tant de questions qui eussent pu etre interessantes' (Cahiers Andre Gide, 5, p. 472). 25 Gustav Regler, The Owl of Minerva, translated by Norman Denny (London, 1959), p. 230. 826</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL TILBY intelligentsia'.26 A young English woman anxious to make a career in journalism, Shiela Grant Duff, was also present - she had been recruited by her German Communist friends to help with correspondence and translations for the English delegation. She recalls in her memoirs: '[Gide] still thought of Russian communism as "an unprecedented experiment ... which fills our hearts with hope ... an impetus capable of carrying forward in its stride the whole human race." He looked forward to the day when, under Communism, "great literature could be made, not as till now out of men's sufferings but of their joy".'27 On the second day, in his principal speech, he paid tribute to 'le genie plebeien' of which Rousseau and Diderot, he claimed, were shining examples. But it was his allocution d'ouverture the day before, on the need to reconcile individualism and a sense of community, national cultures and internationalism, that earned him a standing ovation and, Ehrenburg recalled, the warmest response afforded any of the speakers. According to Gustav Regler, half an hour later, the text, already printed, was to be bought on the streets (Regler, p. 230). Forster's admiration for Gide's performance is vividly recalled in 'Gide and George', which is closely based at this point on his New Statesman article. It is from the earlier account that the following description is taken, since it is, naturally, less well known than the version contained in Two Cheers for Democracy: Gide's theme was the individual - who will never develop his individuality fully until he forms part of an international society. He began with airs and archery; gradually he forgot himself, his style became fluid as his thought soared and sentimentality passed into affection. He denied that humanity would cease to be interesting if it ceased being miserable, on the contrary he imagined 'un 6tat social oiu lajoie soit accessible a tous, et des hommes que lajoie aussi puisse grandir'. He had a tremendous ovation: the whole audience rose to its feet - an honour also accorded to Heinrich Mann, who has become the symbol in France of Nazi persecution. Gide is an elusive and sometimes an unsatisfactory writer; but as an orator that evening he was superb. It was strange to pass out from his eloquence into the disquietude of contemporary Paris, to find outside the Congress Hall, masses of police drawn up in case we gave trouble, and to encounter the lonely flood-lit dome of the Panth6on at the end of a deserted street. As he added in 'Gide and George', 'it seemed to us, as we listened to Gide, that there was a light which the darkness could not put out'. Forster, who had failed to persuade Virginia Woolf to be part of the English delegation,28 said to her in a letter of6June: 'I don't suppose the Conference is of any use - things have gone too far. But I have no doubt as to the importance of people like ourselves inside the conference. We do represent the last utterances of the civilized.'29 It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that to Ehrenburg he should have appeared 'the sceptical English novelist'. Shiela Grant Duff recalls that 'Forster 26 Ilya Ehrenburg, Eve of War z933-I94I, translated by Tatiana Shebunina and Yvonne Kapp (London, I963), p. 67 27 Shiela Grant Duff, The Parting of Ways. A Personal Account of the Thirties (London, I982), p. 91. For the texts of the two speeches Gide made, see Andre Gide, Litterature engagee, edited by Yvonne Davet (Paris, I950). 28 As a preliminary to the Congress, Malraux had been to England in March. Virginia Woolf went to a meeting he addressed in Hampstead. She had been taking French lessons from Dorothy Bussy's daughter Janie. When later she was pressed by Forster to be on the Committee of Vigilance, she frequently lamented the correspondence it entailed and claimed 'Gide and other famous French abused me' (letter to Ethel Smyth, 3 August I936, Letters, vi, 62). 29 Quoted by Quentin Bell, Virginia Woolf. A Biography, 2 vols (London, I972), II, I88, and by Furbank, II, 193. 827</page><page sequence="12">Gide, Forster, and Dickinson made a characteristic speech, gentle, timid and moderate, full of mea culpa not only about the limitations of British freedom but also of his own attitudes'. The speech was, of course, later incorporated in the collection Abinger Harvest. At the time, it must have struck many of the continental delegates as curiously parochial, as they listened, for example, to Forster's account of the prosecution ofJames Hanley on the grounds that his novel Boy was an obscene libel.30 (Assuming that they were able to hear, that is, since Forster 'proved unwilling or unable to make proper use of the microphone'.)31 To them, Forster's bogey, 'Fabio- Fascism', cannot have seemed as much of a threat as Hitler's Germany. Malraux's biographer adds the information that the Congress took place in a heat wave and that universally 'on tombait la veste', with the exception of Benda, Heinrich Mann, and .. . Forster.32 The Congress was also the occasion for the first of the very few personal meetings that occurred between Gide and Forster. The story has already been told ofForster's being taken out to dinner by Gide and Malraux. As soon as the meal was over, Forster's hosts got up and left, presenting him, as he said, 'with the spectacle of their distinguished backs' (Furbank, II, p. I95). From this and the rarity of their meetings and communications, we may assume that Gide's personal sympathy for Forster was not boundless. If Forster singled out for praise the speech Gide made at the Congress (together with those of Benda and Huxley), we may assume that Gide would not have been prepared to return the compliment. Yet any disappointment Forster may have felt as a result of his meeting with Gide was not allowed to diminish the interest he took in the latter's writings. Thus, in 937 we find him reviewing in The Listener, under the heading 'A Smack for Russia?', Dorothy Bussy's translation of Retour de I'URSS (Listener, 12 May I937). It is a respectful review and one which has the merit of refusing to see Gide's essay as a straightforward rejection of that writer's earlier position. What Gide has written, he insists, 'is not a disavowal of Soviet Russia. It is the confession of a partial disappointment'. Rather than being 'a smack for Russia', Retour de l'URSS highlights faults with the Soviet organism which will pass away,33 since, in Forster's view, 'they 30 Hanley's novel - dedicated to Nancy Cunard - had been published in 1931 but it was only in I935 that the Lancashire Police Authority brought a successful prosecution against the publisher, who was heavily fined. The case outraged liberal opinion (see, for example, Harold Laski's address to the Annual Conference of the Library Association, Library Association Record (i935), p. 360). Hanley, it should be noted, was himself present at the Congress, though not as a delegate (see the Left Review, I I (November I935), 463). 31 See Furbank, I, 194, who cites as his authority the American novelist Katherine Anne Porter, whose account ends: 'The applause at the end was barely polite, but it covered the antics of that part of the audience near me; a whole pantomime of malignant ridicule, meaning that Mr Forster and all his kind were already as extinct as the dodo.' Christina Stead, who reported the proceedings for the Left Review, formed a rather different impression: '[Forster's] long, cordial and characteristic speech on liberty of expression and of the safeguarding of the cultural tradition, expressed the ideas of many English people. ... Mr Forster was particularly applauded for the courageous self-abnegation, modesty and desire for truth in his statement, and, by the youth of the audience, for the remark, "You have guessed that I am not a Communist: perhaps I should be one if I were younger and braver, because in Communism I see hope"' (Left Review, I I (November 1935), 457-58). Also appreciative of Forster's speech, it has to be said, was the young Paul Krantz: 'Dank des ebenso geistreichen wie ernsthaften einleitenden Vortrages von E. M. Forster begann der KongreB in der verheiBungsvollsten Weise, natiirlich lieB sich dies hohe Niveau nicht funf Tage hindurch halten' (Ernst Erich Noth, Erinnerungen eines Deutschen (Hamburg and Diisseldorf, 197 ), p. 320).

I80. 33 For a useful discussion of Retour de I'URSS which emphasizes the common ground between Gide and the Trotskyists, see W.J.

A rather different reaction, this, from that of the American journalist Janet Flanner, who noted: 'Though he is famed as a thinker, most of Gide's comments are the materialistic observations of any visiting fireman'!34 Shortly after the appearance of this review, Forster found himself in Paris again, this time as the British delegate to the League of Nations Committee for Intellectual Cooperation, the sessions of which were presided over by Paul Valery, or, in his absence, by Gilbert Murray. It seems that Gide was not one of the participants. In his report for the Spectator on the apparently rather lacklustre proceedings, the only French writers Forster mentions are Jules Romains, Georges Duhamel, and J.-R. Bloch (Spectator, 13 August I937). But Gide was certainly in Paris duringJuly and it seems almost without doubt that it was during this visit that he and Forster came together at a second, somewhat uncomfortable meal. Also present at this meal was Forster's policeman friend, Bob Buckingham; he had accompanied Forster to Paris, perhaps because I937 was the year of the Paris Exhibition. The episode has been recounted by Francis King (who does not, however, assign a date to it): There is a story of a luncheon meeting in Paris between Gide and Forster, to which Forster took along Bob Buckingham, uninvited, in the mistaken belief so common among homo- sexuals, that the friend whom he found so attractive would prove equally so to his host. Buckingham was not of the type that Gide admired; and since he could speak no French, the conversation limped along.35 But if Gide appears not to have been greatly drawn to Forster the man, he eventually came to appreciate at least some of his qualities as a novelist. It was by no means, though, a case of finding Forster's novels instantly appealing. Although Gide possessed a copy of The Longest Journey in I920, he does not seem to have read it at this point. Four years later, Dorothy Bussy told him that A Passage to India was 'le meilleur livre paru recemment' (Gide-Bussy, I, p. 476) but it seems that he did not get round to reading it untilJanuary I937, prompted then no doubt by the fact of having met Forster. His response to the novel was equivocal. Once he had finished reading it, he wrote to Dorothy Bussy confessing: 'Passage ... ne me plait pas beaucoup, encore queje le tienne pour un livre tres remarquable' (Gide-Bussy, III, p. I 9). During the war, at Tipassa, he turned to both Howards End and The Longest Journey but once again his respect for their author is not equalled by his pleasure. His reaction is recorded in Journal 1939-1949: 'Je me plonge dans Twelfth Night, abandon- nant The Longest Journey, a quoi je ne parviens pas a m'interesser suffisamment. J'ai lu, le mois dernier, patiemment, Howard's [sic] End, dont il ne me reste a peu pres rien, qu'une grande estime pour Forster.'36 The following year he reiterates to Mme Bussy: 'A la fois avec ennui et estime Howards End de Forster', which leads his correspondent to declare her own disappointment in Forster (Gide-Bussy, III, pp. 316, 318). But in 1946 we find him coming back to A Passage to India and, although he finds Forster's English heavy going, for the first time he pronounces the word 'plaisir' in connexion with one of Forster's works: 'Je n'ai guere pris plaisir 34 Janet Flanner, Paris Was Yesterday I925-1939 (London, I973), p. I68. 35 Francis King, E. M. Forster and his World (London, 1978), pp. 81-82. 36 Journal 1939-1949 (Paris, I 954), p. 272. 829</page><page sequence="14">830 Gide, Forster, and Dickinson qu'a quelques lectures, en plus du Virgile quotidien: particulierement Passage to India (mais d'un anglais, d'une ecriture difficile a l'exces) qui me parait excellent, autant queje le puis comprendre' (Gide-Bussy, III, pp. 375, 378). This was also the occasion for a longish entry in his Journal: Je poursuis la lecture de Passage to India de Forster. Si je le comprenais mieux, ce serait, je pense, avec ravissement; car ce livre me parait, pour autant que j'en puisse juger, une merveille d'intelligence, de tact, d'ironie, de prudence et d'habilete. Mais trop de choses m'echappent; et peut-etre lui pretai-je a l'exces, meublant a l'avantage de Forster tous les blancs de mon incomprehension; car tout ce que je comprends me parait de la qualite la meilleure. J'aime, et plus encore que ce qu'il dit, ce qu'il suggere et insinue, comme incidemment et sans se commettre, dans des phrases d'apparence inoffensives qui con- traignent le lecteur a une sorte de complicite. Combien me plait, par exemple: 'There was a moment's silence, such as oftenfollows the triumph of rationalism'. (Journal I939-49, p. 290) At long last the linguistic barrier separating Gide from Forster's subtlety was crumbling, so when in I947 Dorothy Bussy asked Gide whether he would like to meet Forster when he came to London, the comparative eagerness with which he accepts is now more easily comprehensible: 'Pour l'amour du ciel, ne me faites pas connaitre trop de nouveaux visages: pourtant Forster tres volontiers' (Gide-Bussy, III, PP 457,459)- Gide came to England in June I947 and duly collected from the University of Oxford the honorary degree Enid Starkie had successfully sought for him. But he did not see Forster because the latter was still in America.37 The last document in this incomplete sketch of a sketchy relationship consists of an unpublished letter from Forster to Dorothy Bussy. Written from King's College, Cambridge, it is dated 4 April 1948: Dear Madame Bussy, How very kind of you to take this trouble! I am naturally delighted to have Gide's opinion: please when you write to him next; will you let him know how pleased I am. I will not trouble him with a letter direct, for he sounds unwell, I have sometimes written to him in the past, and he knows how highly I esteem him. I think we did meet once - many years back - and was very glad to hear from you. Yours sincerely, E. M. Forster38 37 Dorothy Bussy, in her letter of 12 May I947, had wrongly informed him that Forster 'est revenu recemment dans ce pays'. 38 This letter is also in the Bibliotheque Doucet, a clear indication that Dorothy Bussy sent it on to Gide. Since the completion of this article, I have been able, through the courtesy of the Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin, to consult a further, short manuscript in which Forster paid tribute to Gide's example. Asked in 1960 about the circumstances in which this text was published, Forster replied that he had no recollection ofthe article but imagined it was probably written for a Resistance paper and published, if at all, in French. (His supposition is likely to be correct, since there is at one point in the text a direct address to 'my Free French friends'.) The main thrust of the article is similar to that of the two other pieces Forster wrote on Gide, though he clearly felt that on this occasion it would have been inappropriate to dwell on Gide's shortcomings. Gide, he states, is admired above all as a free mind ('It is natural that, today, such a mind should be with the Free French'), but also for his attitude to conscience, his upholding of Taste, his being 'emotionally internationalist', and 'his absence of race-prejudice, his condemnation of defeatism . . his hatred of cruelty, his common sense about homosexuality, his dislike of fashion and smartness, his sense of humour, his dramatic and fantastic powers'. He ends by singling out what Gide had written about old age: 'Certains pourrissent et d'autres s'ossifient; tous vieillissent. Seule une grande ferveurintellectuelle triomphe de la fatigue et de la fl6trissure du corps.' For an account of Gide's visit to Cambridge in 1918, see also the study published by D. A. Steel, since the completion of this article, 'Escape and Aftermath: Gide in Cambridge 1918', Yearbook of English Studies, 15 (I985), 125-59.</page><page sequence="15">MICHAEL TILBY Gide's opinion on what? Probably Howards End, judging by the concluding sentences of'Gide's Death': No one could wish old people to live on in days like these, yet I wish he had found time to write me a promised letter on the subject of Howards End. Year after year I have heard through mutual friends that he was contemplating one. It would have been a precious and provocative possession. (Two Cheers for Democracy, p. 225) It is perhaps appropriate that the account of their relationship should end on a note of disappointment. The clear impression we gain of the relationship between Gide and Forster is not one of closeness. Gide certainly seems to have been more responsive to the company of Dickinson. It might appear that the story of his contacts with Forster was one of lost opportunities. If, for example, Forster had been more forthcoming on the subject of Maurice, Gide might have taken a greater interest in him. Yet not all the blame, if blame there be, can be laid at Forster's door. It was unfortunate that their meeting in I935 coincided with the peak of Gide's public enthusiasm for Commu- nism. The story might have been different if Dorothy Bussy had been one of Forster's acquaintances. In one of her letters to Gide she is clearly surprised that she does not know Forster well; for he was, she said, an excellent friend of several of her best friends (Gide-Bussy, III, p. 378). It should also be remembered, however, that in French eyes at least, Gide and Forster were not equals. Forster's reputation in France was slight. Until the appearance in 1947 of Charles Mauron's translation of A Room with a View, the only novel ofForster's available in French translation was A Passage to India, Mauron's translation of which was published twenty years before. Attempts to appreciate his work in the original were, as I have shown, not always successful. Dorothy Bussy may have expressed surprise that Gide should find Forster's writing difficult but it is by no means incomprehensible that what Christopher Isherwood described as Forster's 'tea-tabling' should have left French readers perplexed. Nor was it simply a confrontation of diverse literary manners. However close the two writers' preoccupations at times, Forster's diffident, self- effacing personality presented a striking contrast with the more flamboyant, self-confident Frenchman. M MICHAEL TILBY SELWYN COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE Appendix KILL YOUR EAGLE! (By E. M. FORSTER) Prometheus Ill-Bound. By Andre Gide. Literal Translation by Lilian Rothermere. Chatto and Windus. 7s. 6d. net. Andre Gide is a great figure in the literary horizon of France, but the English do not read him much. Both his merits and his defects alienate him from us. It is his merit that he cannot be labelled, and we have a coarse love of labels. Anatole France is 'satirical', Pierre Loti 'exotic', Paul Bourget 'reactionary', and each has secured in England the public that demands his particular brand. But Gide provides all three brands, and more besides, which we regard as unsatisfactory. Sometimes he is decrying religion and society, sometimes he turns out scented lyrical descriptions of oriental life, sometimes he upholds miracles and titles and other trimmings, new and old, that Authority assumes. His outlook is so subtle and personal that he 831</page><page sequence="16">832 Gide, Forster, and Dickinson cannot keep long to the paths of other men, nor indeed to his own. He is always veering. And this brings us to his defect. He lacks strength. His work is terribly uneven. He loses interest and vigour in the middle of a flight and falls disappointingly to the ground. Much has been written about his philosophy, but surely the truth is that he has none. He is like some exquisite screen perfectly designed but weak on its hinges so that it fails as soon as we stand it in front of the fire. The English like labels, but, very rightly, they like strength too, and Gide provides neither. (A Fantasy on Conscience) Le Prometheee mal enchaine, though full of originality, is not one of his best books. It is a fantasy about conscience. The eagle that feeds on the liver of Prometheus symbolizes the nagging moral force that each man carries in his breast and that drives him to idealism and unselfish- ness, and also to pity his fellows when they are unworthy of pity and to help them when they do not want to be helped. As the power of conscience grows, the natural healthy impulses decline. The eagle, which began as a small mangey bird, no better than a vulture, becomes in time magnificent; while Prometheus, originally a plump young Titan, shrinks into a sentimental neurotic, who abases himself beneath his tormentor and feels a morbid love for the terrific beak. The deeper his conscience stabs, the happier he is. The idea is brilliant, and characteristic of Gide, who is always hesitating between paganism and self-abnegation and unable to decide which is best. This time paganism wins. Prometheus in the end kills his eagle, and eats it at a Paris restaurant. It tastes delicious. Afterwards one of his friends ask him what is the use of having an eagle. He replies: 'You get a sport dinner and some beautiful feathers.' That is to say, conscience, though it preys on a man, gives him something good that he would not have had otherwise. And the lesson of the book is, firstly, the importance of having a conscience; and, secondly, the importance of stifling it sometime or other and returning, richer for the experience, to the life of instinct. It is the book of a pagan who has made a profitable excursion into Christianity; it is written, as Gide himself put it, with a feather from the dead eagle's wing. (Literal Translations) The idea is not well worked out. Led away by his fertile fancy, Gide tires himself by introducing other motives, until the main fantasy is enfeebled and obscured. Nor is he aided by his translator. Lady Rothermere has had the unhappy notion of rivalling the achievement of Ollendorf, and rendering her original literally. Gide is always a master of style, and it is sad that his delicate phrases should turn into 'but the introduction not having been asked for, without more ado the two men both sat down' or 'thus the reader will allow us to leave at present someone he will hear of sufficiently later on' or "'Ah bah!" cried Prometheus, "you interest me enormously".' Indeed, some of the sentences must be quite unintelligible to readers who know no French; one has to translate them mentally before the meaning dawns. To be literal and to be lucid are two different things, but Lady Rothermere appears to identify them. Nor is she more lucid when she writes English all on her own. Her preface contains sentences such as 'Zeus, the banker, poses this disinterested act because his thought refuses or hesitates to admit it.' Truly a poser! No, Gide must not be judged on this inauspicious little volume. He has written far better elsewhere on the death of eagles, notably in Les Caves du Vatican. He has celebrated their victory in La Porte Etroite. He has ignored their existence in Isabella [sic]. Let us get down our French dictionaries and grammars and tackle these originals. There are greater books in literature, but there is nothing exactly like them in French, and nothing the least like them in English. (From the Daily News, I7 June 919)</page></plain_text>
