<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MYSTIC ROSE. A Study of Primitive Marriage and of Primitive Thought in its Bearing on Marriage. By ERNEST CRAWLEY. New Edit., rev. and greatly enlarged by THEODORE BESTERMAN. 2 vOIs. Methuen &amp; Co., 1927. 8" x 5". Pp. xx+275; vii+340. 30s. IT is always invidious to review a classic,-and Crawley's Mystic Rose certainly has a claim to the title,- but, when a new edition appears after a lapse of exactly a quarter of a century, it is perhaps only natural to reconsider the book in the light of more recent work.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. 399 Crawley's theory is by this time both well-known and largely accepted. Crawley argues that each sex instinctively regards the other with psychological antipathy, and that " marriage ceremonies neutralise the dangers attaching to union between the sexes " (vol. ii., p. 34). To support this argument, he reviews the whole question of sexual relationships among primitive peoples, and perceives that there exists a system of taboo between male and female, implying a sense of " critical danger in contact". Marriage ceremonies, he thinks, were designed to neutralise this danger by lifting the taboo, or,-to adopt Sir James Frazer's happy metaphor,-by insulating what is electri- cally charged. The turning-point of this entire theory is, of course, the definition of " danger ". Crawley defines it as " the predication of evil influences and the imposition of taboo " (vol. i., p. 7). He then proceeds to demonstrate that evil influences are indeed predicated, and taboos imposed, at sexual crises, and en- deavours to shew that primitive sexual relationships are dictated and informed by them, and that marriage ceremonies " hansel " against them. A criticism which at once arises is that this definition fails sufficiently to realise that the predication of evil influences is merely a rationalisation of a psychological reaction. When, therefore, we are informed that evil influences are predicated in sexual crises, this merely means that Sex incites a variety of psychological complexes thereby rationalised. It follows from this that what are explained by Crawley as " neutralisations of danger " are rather to be regarded as " compensations for psychological complexes ", and as going back to a stage of thought anterior to the rationalisation of those complexes by the predication of evil influences. Nor is this a mere translation of Crawley's definition into terms of psychology. It involves at once a necessary widening of the whole field, for, by defining marriage ceremonies as " compen- sations for psychological complexes " rather than as " neutrali- sations of danger ", we avoid the precarious position of re- stricting the material and relevant complexes to such as may be rationalised by the predication of evil influences. It is in the tacit imposition of this restriction that Crawley's theory seems</page><page sequence="3">400 Reviews. to suffer a crucial limitation. It possesses the characteristic weakness of all monogenetic theories in explaining from a single psychological state facts which more naturally result from and reflect a whole congress and gamut of states. If we consider Crawley's material from this point of view we shall find, I think, that it is capable of equally plausible explanation, and certainly of greater illustration, from the conditions we actually know in the everyday world of human passions. For instance, the customs whereby the bridegroom wears female costume, or the bride male costume, need not be ex- plained as removals of " danger " by means of disguise, but as symbolising approximation to the partner's personality,-a one-sided method of " becoming one flesh ". Again, the custom of compelling a few days' post-nuptial continence may be rooted in nothing but the same attitude as inspires the common practice of sexual " teasing ", viz., a desire to enhance in a man's estimation the value of a woman's virginity, and, secondly, a desire on her part to compensate for her sense of inferiority by herself being mistress of the situation to the extent of subordinating to her own cruel whim the gratification of the man's excited passions. Again, the treatment of a bridal couple as royalty need not be explained as pure disguise in order to break taboo (vol. ii., p. 50) ; it may result merely from a desire to complement and fete the newly weds, as who should say that his love is a " queen " or a " princess ". Moreover, it could be explained as due to the influence of the tphs ypos in which the bridegroom was the king. (Incidentally, it may be men- tioned that this is also a Mandean custom.) Lastly, a distinction should be drawn between the definite sense of peril and the vaguer feeling of ignorant uncertainty, in which maiden-modesty has its roots, I think, far more than in the less vague and more definite shrinking from " danger " which Crawley postulates. Altogether, Crawley seems to take too little account of the complex character of sexual psychology. A particularly glaring instance of this is his adherence (vol. i., p. 216) to the old theory that secrecy in intercourse is due to fear of disturbance. Is it not more true to human nature to find its origin in a primitive feeling for the intimacy of this thing ? Is it not rather the idea</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. 401 of " procul o procul abeste profani ",-an appreciation, that is, of the immediate connection between sympathy and intimacy, as who would kiss in the dark or maintain that " two's company" ? A serious limitation in Crawley's argument is his failure adequately to appreciate the social aspects of marriage cere- monies. In this he is followed by Mr. Besterman, as when they vehemently deny (vol. ii., p. 32) that the ceremonies ever aimed at joining " together the man or woman.. . with the life or blood or flesh of the tribe ". They argue that " the mere existence of the egoistic impulse . . . is enough to discredit the suggestion ". But is it ? Surely, there is no reason why an individualistic act, accompanied by an egoistic impulse, should not have its communal implications recognised in the ceremonial confirmation of it ? The case of modern marriage would, indeed, seem to contradict Crawley. Moreover, that marriage cere- monies did sometimes aim at joining one party to the life or blood of the other's tribe is seemingly proved by the fact that in ancient Semitic marriage the bridegroom (hathan) was circum- cised by his father-in-law (hkten),-circumcision being a Semitic method of tribal initiation.' There are also a number of other questionable contentions. For instance, if, as Crawley maintains, intercourse was regarded as " dangerous ", (I should prefer " critical "), and if the jus primae noctis etc. were designed to avert the " risk " from the bride- groom, why is it that in many parts the bridegroom attaches such importance to finding his wife virgo intacta ? Moreover, if it was intercourse, and not, as I should suggest, the woman that was regarded as " critical " (or " dangerous "), how, from the bride's viewpoint, was the situation mended by the substitution of Harry for John ? Moreover, if it was intercourse and not the woman that was the " danger ", why did not the bride- groom more generally thanis known have a bride-substitute as the bride had a bridegroom substitute ? If intercourse was regarded as dangerous because of the acquisition of characteristics of the 1 The verb hatana means in Arabic " circumcise ".

Why should any initial act on the part of the woman serve to remove or neutralise the danger ? Surely, it would be implicit equally in every successive intercourse. Clearly the nuptial- night customs are rooted, not in the neutralisation of " danger attending the union of the sexes ", but in compensation for a bride's sex repulsion and other psychological complexes. One fears also that Crawley sometimes supports his views by misinterpreting customs. Thus, the Zulu annual slaughter of a bull as a strengthening of the king (vol. i., pp. 274, 331) is probably in origin no " neutralisation of danger by exchange ", but merely a humane development of an original king-slaughter. The bull is no surrogate, but an alternative representation of tribal vigour in theriomorphic instead of anthropomorphic form. The medial stage of this development is seen when the " tribal vigour ", i.e. its " divinity ", rests in a god-king as well as in a theriophormic deity, (e.g. Dionysus; the king is Dionysus incarnate, but Dionysus is tauriform as well).2 Incidentally, this taurobolium coupled with prayers for the king also took place at the Babylonian Zagmuk festival, and on the dies sanguis of the Attis-cult at Rome. (Tertullian, Apologet. 25 : taurobolium pro salute imperatoris). The present writer suggests that Psalm 72 ("0 God give Thy judgments to the king" etc.) represents the cult-hymn of a similar occasion (? New Year) in the Hebrew religion. So, again, the inversion of offices at the Saturnalia and Feast of Fools is explained as a case of neutrali- sation by substitution; but careful research shews that the object of this is to signify that the king, i.e. incarnation of tribal vigour, grows feeble at the end of the year. A few small points with which to close :- The " Mother-in-Law Complex ".-Mr. Besterman is to be thanked for his valuable tables illustrating avoidances. A suggestion which may be offered is that one motive of the complex, as far as the son-in-law's attitude is concerned, is the fact that he resents the children's seeing him in a subordinate position. 2 For the full working-out of this theme, I may be allowed to make reference to my forthcoming work " Kyklos ".</page><page sequence="6">Reviews. 403 Interchange of Dress.-Crawley does not appreciate the possibility of the psychological connection between religious and sexual neuroses. Although, in many cases, the donning of female dress by eunuch-priests symbolises mere loss of virility and association (in some cases) in the mystic personality of a female deity, yet in a number of instances,-as in that of the boy who joined the bote (vol. ii., p. 113),-I think it is rooted in a piece of sexual psychology. It seems to me possible that, the borderline between religious and sexual psychology being sometimes very narrow, the rites of a cult may very often be nothing but expressions of the closely allied sex-feeling.

The bride is called the " secluded one " (kallah, kallatu). Lastly, a word about this new edition. Mr. Besterman has done his work with painstaking application, and he is especially to be thanked for his valuable bibliography and tables and for the enlarged index. But one would have liked, in the re-edition after twenty-five years of a work of this importance, some more thorough treatment of the problems raised, in the light of recent research. Mr. Besterman does not satisfy at least one reader by merely adding sporadic references to support Crawley. He might well have helped us to a new orientation of mind in approaching Crawley's work after the advances made since its last edition. He might well have taken as a model Dr. Stanley Cook's re-edition of Robertson-Smith's Religion of the Semites. This, however, is a criticism of editorial outlook, rather than of a performance which is admirable. The only point in the editing which really jars is the somewhat disrespectful tone in which Mr. Besterman voices his objections to the criticisms 3 Cf. also the ceremonial bath in Arabian weddings, (zeffet el-hammam).</page><page sequence="7">404 Reviews. of Crawley's theory advanced by such pioneers and authorities as Van Gennep and Dr. Westermarck. This tends to take the scent from the Rose. It is a pity that the book appeared just too late to consider Briffault's The Mothers and Malinowski's Sex and Repression. Both works would, no doubt, have moved the editor from his conservative adherence to Crawley, and,-it is to be feared,-both works rather tend to " date " this book. In the bibliography one misses Leathy's History of Marriage (1916), and Oesterley's The Sacred Dance. I have noticed only two misprints: vol. i., p. 343, 1. 13, " kissed " for " kisses ", and vol. i., p. 354, 1. 16, " lord's " for " Lord's ". THEODORE GASTER.</page></plain_text>
