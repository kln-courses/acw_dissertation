THOMAS Art and Ecology in Nineteenth-Century France: The Landscapes of Theodore Rousseau Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000. 285 pp.; 91 b/w ills. $62.50 When a painter takes his easel, his paints, and his homemade lean-to and wanders through the countryside choosing a spot, what is he doing? Is he following some preconditioning that will lead him to select (or to assemble from scattered elements) a soothing pastoral scene or rugged, wild terrain? Are the forces propelling him personal, historical, cultural, social? How, in other words, are we to under- stand landscape painting in general and in the middle of the 19th century in particular? The difficulty, Greg Thomas contends, is that we have been taught to treat the latter as a stage in the development of realism-or its more free-spirited companion, naturalism-- with plein-air painting taking a pivotal role. Artists had long sketched out-of-doors, but the oil canvases they produced were com- posed in their studios. The midcentury inno- vation, it is commonly accepted, was that nature would now be captured more imme- diately (even if sketching and reworking were still practiced), and hence more truthfully.' The plein-air movement or new painterly techniques therefore receive scant attention from Thomas. Rather, he focuses on the in- tentions of the Barbizon school and, more specifically, what motivated Th6odore Rous- seau (1812-1867), the chef de file of French midcentury landscape artists, to paint what he did and to structure his paintings the way he did. These practices and often subconscious motivations, Thomas determines, can be summed up by the term ecological. By "ecolog- ical," Thomas means an inchoate perception of the organic unity of nature where man is more often intruder than participant. It is important to Thomas's argument that Rous- seau's approach to nature remain more intu- itive than articulated, because he sees Rous- seau's ecologism emerging from and through his art and not as a full-blown doctrine. His contention is that Rousseau himself was no more able to understand what he was striving for than contemporary critics who had only momentary insights into the new vision of nature he offered them. They were ham- pered-Rousseau included-by the fact that there existed as yet no conceptual language to express this new holistic approach to na- ture. Although he treats Rousseau as an innova- tor, Thomas is also intent on separating him from another tradition that fits him into a heroic mold as a romantic visionary perse- cuted by a philistine artistic establishment. For the fifteen years before the Revolution of 1848, Salonjuries rejected Rousseau's entries, earning him the nickname of the grand refus&amp;. Then his fame soared so that by the 1867 Exposition Universelle he headed the jury selecting paintings for the artistic display. He finally received the coveted legion of honor and in 1865 was invited to spend a week at Napoleon III's retreat at Compiegne. Rous- seau's conservationist battle to salvage the forest of Fontainebleau's oaks is treated at length by Thomas, but he refuses to align the artist with a political camp. Rousseau circu- lated in a radical, avant-garde milieu during the July Monarchy but was also adopted by Orleanist art lovers, as he would be by Napo- leonic industrialists and ministers. Hence, we may perceive in him a mixture of stances, perhaps more liberal in his younger days and of a more conservative bent later. Thomas prefers to see him as fundamentally apolitical. Even artistic battles were fought on his behalf rather than at his instigation, drawing him into camps that portrayed him as martyr to whatever artistic creed his heralds champi- oned. All in all, Thomas means to disentangle Rousseau from the stranglehold of previous interpretations and free him for his own. French landscape painting when Rousseau began his career in the early 1830s remained captive to the classicizing modes of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, privileging Ital- ianate landscapes, presented to the eye as prospects and bounded like a stage by fore- ground trees. In the 1820s, through Richard Parkes Bonington, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner, French landscape artists en- countered a different approach, inspired by Dutch golden-age painters, centered on northern climes and depictions of rural tasks. These examples stimulated a desire to paint</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 203 French landscapes. French artists were, of course, fully aware of the three standard modes of representation of landscape (devel- oped in the 18th century): the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque, each with its apposite mood and subject matter, which viewers were coming to expect not only from paintings but also from scenery itself and to which a new guidebook industry shamelessly pandered. Rousseau's paintings partook of all three, though he was more naturally wont, as a late Romantic, to toy with the sublime and to render country life in picturesque terms. Yet in both cases, Thomas insists, he devel- oped his own particular approach. Art and Ecology in Nineteenth-Century France is neither an exhaustive study of Rousseau's paintings nor a chronological one. It is the- matic and focuses on those paintings that Thomas deems significant: paintings of woods, ponds, marshes, mountains, and graz- ing grounds that contain what he considers an ecological message.2 This is perhaps as good a time as any to lament the fact that Princeton University Press has accentuated this discursive approach by providing only small black-and-white illustrations, rendering none of Rousseau's sensual feel and vibrancy (which, to his credit, Thomas does try to cap- ture). Thomas stresses two features in Rousseau's paintings: their formal construction and their message. It would seem that Rousseau bor- rowed his fixation on the middle distance from Dutch landscape artists, as contempo- raries like Charles Baudelaire were quick to recognize, but he used it to unusual advan- tage. Canvases, divided into three planes, pull the eye toward the middle ground, which is encompassed within an ellipsoid construction (even if Thomas hesitates to overstate Rous- seau's geometric proclivities). The fore- ground is typically shrouded in darkness, sometimes framed by trees, while the middle distance is bathed in light, revealing a forest clearing, a plain, a meadow with cattle graz- ing, a river or a pond, lit by fugitive rays even in the stormiest of weathers. Above the trees (for there are always trees), vast yellowish gray skies render the atmosphere almost palpable. Changes in weather, the effect of seasons and times of day mesmerized Rousseau. What is more, Thomas argues, the viewer's eye is drawn toward a smaller area within the el- lipse, represented by a person, animal, or clump of trees, that creates what he calls a central "reflection point." The effect of the oval motif was to grant the landscape greater independence than the stagelike vistas usually offered the viewer, which suggested that the landscape was both a spectacle made for him and one he built through his gaze. Since an ellipsoid middle ground does not alter with every movement of the head, it does not seem to depend on the viewer for its existence. This spatial organization both attracted the viewer and alienated him, and thus embodied per- fectly Rousseau's ambivalence toward man's relationship to nature. Not being a student of optics nor trained to understand perspective like an art historian, I had some problems following Thomas's argu- ment about inclusion and exclusion from the landscape. Perhaps in my ignorance I better represent the prospective viewer than the spe- cialist might. I no more desired to project myself inside Rousseau's pictures nor felt ejected than I do before Jacob van Ruisdael's Wheat Fields (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), which I use as my computer screen saver. The blocks to this penetration that Thomas describes, for example, for Un- der the Birches, Evening, also known as The Priest-the lack of a path leading the eye in- ward, the scrub brush in front, the half-hid- den solitary rider in the middle and the birches soaring above him, highlighted by a shadowed foreground and darkened sky above-did not leave me confused, anxious, or bereft. Rather, the sheer beauty of the scene, the autumnal glow of the reddish leaves, the warm tones instilled a sense of contemplative peace and contentment. Rob- ert Herbert forty years ago appealed to view- ers to take the time to study Barbizon paint- ings. "How easy to pass by a painting of Fontainebleau by Rousseau, but how reward- ing to let him transport us to the privacy of intense artistic experience."3 Thomas, too, sees Rousseau as a painter who requires care- ful study. What is one to make therefore of those paintings, like Under the Birches, that draw us in irresistibly because of their sheer plastic beauty and sensual effect? As Thomas demonstrates, Rousseau's pur- pose was to induce new responses to nature, in part by aestheticizing what had heretofore been considered either ugly or at best mar- ginal and certainly inappropriate subjects for high art-like marshes.4 "Do you understand now," he wrote, "that everything my intelli- gence reproves is in direct relation to every- thing my heart aspires to, and that the sight of human disdain and baseness is to me as pow- erful a vehicle of action in the exercise of my art as the depths of serene contemplation that I have been able to put in myself since childhood."5 Thomas discusses paintings from four places that he thinks were espe- cially important to Rousseau and to the de- velopment of his philosophy: the forest of Fontainebleau, the Jura mountains to the east, the Berry in central France, and the Landes on the southwestern coast. He visited the last three in the 1840s and spent most of his adult life in the village of Barbizon, bor- dering the forest of Fontainebleau. Rous- seau's travels in the 1840s were partly acciden- tal and partly intentional. He followed friends and invitations but was also keen to paint different kinds of scenery. It is while traveling, Thomas maintains, that Rousseau became keenly aware of the changes affecting French agriculture, and this realization fed his long- ing for a world gone by. Rousseau's percep- tion of the countryside (and that of the Bar- bizon school as a whole) resulted therefore from observation of changes, which then fu- eled an incipient urban tendency to romanti- cize the countryside (that which, borrowing from Nicholas Green, Thomas calls metropoli- tanism). Rousseau mingled private sensibility and observation; he did not come by his "ecology" from reading newspaper stories about reclamation projects or the current lit- erature in science and natural history. The latter, Thomas declares in the introduction, followed an independent path and did not influence the painter. It is therefore worthwhile to pause and re- flect on the changes that Rousseau would have been privy to and on the specific choices he made both about the locales he visited and the views he painted. The department of Seine et Marne in which Barbizon was located was one of the most prosperous in France, sensitive to market developments and agricul- tural innovations. For example, use of pipes to drain rainwater from fields was replacing traditional ditches as of the mid-1840s.6 There was growing specialization, with wheat as the principal crop, a switch from sheep to cattle, and a rise in market gardening. Thomas mentions the importance of fallow land, and Rousseau would have encountered some in Seine et Marne, where even in the 1830s 20 percent of the land still lay fallow. This rose to 40 percent in the Indre but fell to less than 20 percent in the Landes, where more of the land lay waste, despite the plant- ing of maize to replace rye. So, indeed, there might well have been remnants of the old economy around Barbizon. Leaving one-half or one-third of the land uncultivated each year had become a widespread practice in the Middle Ages as a way to restore nutrients. Thomas seems to misunderstand the place of the fallow, which he discusses in relation to the 1855 painting The Drawbridge, showing a cow grazing on what appears to me to be scrub around a gated farm. Cows did not graze on fallow land, which was reserved for sheep, so this painting should not be read as demonstrating a new chemical understand- ing of fallow's centrality (here presented as cutting edge based on two books by German and French chemists), when all efforts in fact tended toward reducing it, by planting nitro- gen-fixing clovers or resorting to marl, lime, guano, and eventually chemical fertilizers. Rousseau's fixation on threatened waste- land would seem more topical. Twenty to forty percent of the Landes in fact consisted in wasteland, the amount increasing under the July Monarchy (and not decreasing as yet during Rousseau's voyages), compared with 10 to 20 percent of the Indre and less than 2.5 percent in Seine et Marne.7 A rise in popula- tion and increasing demand for food in the first half of the century had stimulated mas- sive clearance of marginal lands and their conversion to arable. Plans for draining marshes were afoot, but large-scale hydraulic works in the neediest departments of Indre and Landes did not receive financial backing until the late 1840s and began in earnest only in the 1850s.8 By then, it had become obvious that it was pointless converting poor sandy soils or reclaiming heath for arable, and pine forests were planted instead. Perhaps aware- ness of these developments prompted Rous- seau to record the endangered marshland. Moreover, many of Rousseau's paintings fea- ture flocks, and he could see that grazing practices were changing around Fontaine- bleau, as sheep disappeared from the forest.</page><page sequence="3">204 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2003 VOLUME LXXX\V NUMBER I In France, overall, artificial meadows were slow in coming, and in many places animals still pastured on what remained of the fallow (sheep), on common land and wastelands (pigs and cattle), and in forests where the local population had been granted this right (cattle). The number of sheep had started to decline in Seine et Marne by 1837 with the disappearance of fallow (it was one of the departments where guano came into use), whereas the highest numbers were recorded in Indre and the Landes between 1852 and 1862. Cattle, pigs, and horses replaced sheep except in the Landes, where pastures had practically disappeared by the late 19th cen- tury.9 In other words, Rousseau would have witnessed far fewer changes during his travels than in the department of Seine et Marne, where he resided. Thomas underestimates both the mythic fears and practical medical concerns raised by marshland and hence the perception of drainage (think of the recent historical film Ridicule, 1996, which makes the point for nearby Dombes) when he comments that truly insalubrious waters lay fifteen miles north of the village of Le Fay in Indre (Berry), where Rousseau spent six months. The implication is that in painting Berry. ponds, Rousseau was not rehabilitating malar- ial pits. In the middle of the 19th century, disease was still widely linked to miasma, the foul air that arose where there was poor cir- culation, most vividly associated with stagnant pools.'0 Rousseau, who fled Paris during the cholera epidemic of 1848 to the safety of Barbizon, would surely have been aware of this. There is something ghoulish about his choice to visit two of the most benighted, underpopulated departments of France, where poverty and disease were rampant, to search out pristine nature in the primeval ooze, and to paint them as picturesque graz- ing grounds. During the trip -to the Jura, he had indulged in the more traditional strong sensations of painting the Alps (even if, as Thomas points out, he rescrambled the land- scape to suit his purposes, just as he did in Fontainebleau and elsewhere). He would now seek out a different kind of sublime, as he himself put it-what his intellect decried and his heart commended-the life force at work even in the most unpromising settings. As a whole, Barbizon school landscapes are sparsely populated, and Rousseau's even less so. Thomas attributes this to his rejection of social narrative, forcing the viewer to come to terms with nature. Depicting underpopulated picturesque rustic scenes had become com- monplace by the 17th century." Whether in- viting the urban viewer to see the countryside as a haven specially made for him, mapping the land, or embodying an anxiety about the peasantry, these paintings emptied the country- side. Recent literature on illustrations from explorations makes the same point: travelers and naturalists presented exotic lands as un- occupied, ready for European transplanta- tion.'2 Choosing to depict a mountain range or forest may excuse (in part) the excision of human beings. Choosing to represent culti- vated areas without people is always laden with social and cultural meaning. Rather than the nonsocial, nonnarrative that Thomas sees him as striving for, Rousseau was in fact at- taching himself to an established convention and "narrative." It is no accident that so few laboring peasants were depicted in the first half of the 19th century. After a century of "noble savage" idealization, the peasantry's violence during the French Revolution had reawakened fears of more "ignoble" savagery. It might be useful to recall thatJean-Franois Millet's Gleaners was received with shouts of horror, as the pitchforks in the background reminded critics of the "pikes of '93."' Barbizon painters as a group seemed to deplore the "massacre" of trees more than the conditions of the peuple (Millet excepted). For Rousseau truly loved the forest. He even wished he were a tree: Silence is golden. When I'm in my obser- vatory at Belle-Croix, I dare not move be- cause silence reveals the heart of things. The woods begin to stir. Silence has al- lowed me, as I stood as still as a tree trunk, to witness a deer in his dwelling and at his toilette. He who lives in silence becomes the center of the world.'4 Yet, oddly, none of this forest fauna appears in his paintings. It wasn't wilderness he was after but inhabited spaces where a very small population eked out a miserable living by grazing animals or collecting firewood in ways that were in fact harming the forest. Rousseau could not have posited a self-sustaining natu- ral equilibrium (usually associated with ecol- ogy), since he preferred places where plants, animals, and people struggled to adapt to damaged environments. Deforestation had generated concern since the turn of the century, when demand for firewood, clearance to extend arable land and vineyards, as well as degradation caused by overgrazing in the underbrush, led to sig- nificant soil erosion and flooding in many parts of France. Between 1852 and 1862, sixty- one departments recorded more felling than replanting, a situation that the Paris region had faced a generation earlier.15 A National Forestry School had been established in 1822 and a new Forestry Code had gone into effect in 1827, but it was not until the Second Em- pire that regions became designated for mas- sive afforestation, among them the Indre and Landes, which Rousseau had visited in the 1840s. These planting programs and the drainage projects that accompanied them were resented by local populations attached to an old grazing lifestyle to which Rousseau was sympathetic. The forest of Fontainebleau had been since time immemorial a royal forest and hunting ground managed by royal foresters. With the development of scientific forestry, concern mounted, at least among the for- esters, about the groves of aged, twisted oaks that were deteriorating fast. Oaks were replaced with northern pines, for which the soil was better suited (to be harvested for timber and resin), with some new planta- tions of oaks and beeches. The rows of pines obscuring the rocky vistas that they had once lovingly painted and the disap- pearance of the celebrated oaks infuriated the artists' colony. It was that forest and those trees that Rousseau would fight to save. He seemed to want the tortured two- to four- hundred-year-old trees to be spared "eutha- nasia" and be allowed "to die with dignity." In 1853, along with his journalist friend Theophile Thore, he petitioned the em- peror, as guardian of the nation, to protect the noble trees that symbolized Frenchness. Few moments embody so clearly Simon Schama's notion of landscape as memory. The oaks were supposedly the remnants of a primeval forest, site of Druidic rites, home to Gallic tribes, and emblems of justice- dispensing monarchs like Saint Louis. These historic treasures had to be pre- served. Two evils threatened to engulf them: profit-driven felling and planting, and tourism promoted by nature entrepre- neur Claude-Franois Denecourt, who cut trails in the forest, plunked down arrows and signs, and created "vistas" for visitors to absorb in a series of preset itineraries. Rousseau asked that that part of the forest be left unmanaged, preserved for true nature lovers such as the Barbizon artists. After a series of investigations and reports, he got what he wanted. Napoleon III's law of August 13, 1861, reserved untouched 1,631 hectares (among them the oak groves of Bas-Breau) of the forest's 13,724 hect- ares. Rousseau had painted oaks over and over, culminating in what Thomas considers his greatest painting: Winter Forest, begun in 1846 and reworked the remainder of his life. The ten-foot canvas shows a mass of twisted, bare trees, dark shades against a golden sunset, arranged around a rocky, frosted clearing. The actual site was reshuffled (compared with original sketches): the trees were made to seem taller by the inclusion of tiny faggot gatherers, trees were redistributed, the road was excised, and the pond enlarged, trans- muting the scenery into Rousseau's most dra- matic and anthropomorphic forest scene. As Thomas puts it, Rousseau turned his trees into heroic characters in a Greek tragedy. Once again the forest was granted an inde- pendent life force that energized Rousseau and bolstered his creativity. No geologic cata- strophist, Rousseau tried to portray nature's "deep time": the very slow changes that ac- company more visible seasonal variations. A generic peasantry living in symbiosis with the land, trapped in unchanging landscapes, helped to convey this message. Rousseau was so in tune with his own epoch that no one questioned this fantastic claim. As ever, view- ers would have concurred that all change originated in the city and not from "tradition- bound, passive rustics." How ecological is all this? Thomas uses the concept tautologically to mean what Rous- seau stood for. He needs to do this, he says, because Rousseau was fumbling his way to- ward a new consciousness that no one had expressed as yet. Although the term ecology was not coined until 1866, Thomas overstates</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 205 his case. To see this, one need only turn to one of the most popular natural scientists of the 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt, who devoted his life to studying and describ- ing ecosystems. His credo appears in the first paragraph of his final synthesis, Cosmos, pub- lished in 1845: In considering the study of physical phe- nomena, not merely in its bearing on the material wants of life, but in its general influence on the intellectual advancement of mankind, we find its noblest and most important result to be a knowledge of a chain of connection, by which all natural forces are linked together, and made mu- tually dependent upon each other, and it is the perception of these relations that exalts our views and ennobles our enjoy- ment. Such a result can, however, only be reaped as the fruit of observation and in- tellect, combined with the spirit of the age, in which are reflected the varied phases of thought.16 And, commenting on landscape painting: Every zone of vegetation has, besides its own attraction, a peculiar character, which calls forth in us special impressions. Refer- ring here only to our own native plants, I would ask, who does not feel himself var- iously affected beneath the sombre shade of a beech, on hills crowned with scattered pines, or in the midst of grassy plains, where the wind rustles among the trem- bling leaves of the birch? As in different organic beings we recognize a distinct physiognomie, and as descriptive beauty and zoology are, in the strict definition of the words, merely analytic classifications of animals and vegetable forms, so there is also a certain physiognomie of nature ex- clusively peculiar to each portion of the earth. The idea which the artist wishes to indicate by the expression "Swiss nature" or "Italian skies" is based on a vague sense of some local characteristic. The azure of the sky, the form of the clouds, the vapory mist resting in the distance, the luxuriant development of plants, the beauty of the foliage, and the outline of the mountains, are the elements which determine the to- tal impression produced by the aspect of any particular region. To apprehend these characteristics, and to reproduce them vis- ibly, is the province of landscape painting; while it is permitted to the artist, by ana- lyzing the various groups, to resolve be- neath his touch the great enchantment of nature-if I may venture on so metaphys- ical an expression-as the written words of men are resolved into a few simple char- acteristics.17 Vitalism was in the air, and it seems likely that Rousseau would have been as familiar with this philosophy as any other educated man.18 The French geographic school took it as its basis, and, as Jean-Marc Besse puts it, landscape aesthetics followed suit; "The visi- ble was not negated, but attributed a status and function above and beyond simple expe- rience. It was expressive: possessing a meaning that is not simply representation."19 For, as he continues, the issue was whether the landscape existed outside the viewer, his perspective, and his positioning. Such questions, in other words, were in the minds of contemporaries, and Rousseau's outlook can readily be linked to an ambient culture rather than resolutely placed outside it. Greg Thomas has provided a stimu- lating way to approach the work of Theodore Rousseau. Whether he is right in calling it eco- logical is another matter, but, however we might choose to describe it, he has reminded us forcefully and eloquently of the multilayered responses to nature and to agrarian transforma- tions in 19th-century France by one of France's greatest landscape painters.
