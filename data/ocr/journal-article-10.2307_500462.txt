<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Harbor of Pompeiopolis A Study in Roman Imperial Ports and Dated Coins* ALINE ABAECHERLI BOYCE PLATES 10-15 In the Newell Collection at the American Numis- matic Society there are twenty bronze coins of Pompeiopolis, the Cilician coastal city whose name was changed from Soli to Pompeiopolis after Pom- pey the Great settled a contingent of his conquered pirates there (pl. II, fig. 3).' This city had long before produced the dramatist Philemon,la the philosopher Chrysippus, and the poet Aratus, whose astronomical work was to be translated into Latin by Cicero and Germanicus Caesar. The old city of Soli had fallen into decay after its devastation by Tigranes of Armenia in the 70s,2 and the Pompeian settlement not only brought a new life and rehabili- tation to the pirates, but it revived the town, which as its coinage shows, continued to thrive for three centuries after its refounding. In the critical years of the third century A.D. Pompeiopolis was destined to be the city from which the forces of Shapur withdrew to the East when the Romans recovered their equilibrium after the capture of Valerian.' Sometime before this event the city had evidently ceased to strike coins. That it long survived the end of its coinage, however, is clear from its mention in Byzantine documents.' The modern name with which the site is associated is Mezetlu, a place near Mersin. The coins of Pompeiopolis, though scarce today, were struck at intervals from the late Roman Re- * This article is an expansion of the last part of a paper read before the Archaeological Institute of America at Princeton, New Jersey, December, I951 (see AJA 56 [1952] 171-72). I am in- debted to the American Numismatic Society for the photographs of the coins and to Dr. Enoch Peterson for permitting me to check some of my Alexandrian material against the coins of the Kelsey Museum at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I was resident when the final touches were put on this ms. I have had helpful suggestions from Dr. Frances Jones, who has been on the site of Pompeiopolis, and have had the benefit of discussion on some of the details concerning Egypt with Professors John Day in New York and Herbert C. Youtie in Ann Arbor; neither of these is responsible for my ideas or any errors of fact or judgment in the discussion concerning Roman Egypt. A very special word of thanks is due Dr. Marion E. Blake, who in the midst of her exacting studies in Rome took time out again and again to answer my questions on Ostia and Portus and provided me with a photostat of the Plan of Portus from Lugli-Filibeck, II Porto di Roma Imperiale e l'Agro Portuense, a work on which I was unable to lay my hands in this country. 1 Strabo, 14.5.8 (671); Plutarch, Pompey, 28; Dio, 36, 37; Pomponius Mela, 13, 71. Neither Appian, who names some of the pirate settlements (Mithr. 96) nor Florus I.41, mentions Pompeiopolis. For the general problem of piracy in the ancient Mediterranean see P. Groebe, "Zum Seeriuberkriege des Pompeius Magnus (67 v.Chr.)," Klio io (1910) 374-89; H. A. Ormerod, Piracy in the Ancient World (Liverpool and London 1924) pp. 235-41 on the settlement discussed here; E.

Lettres, 49, 1954), devotes a chapter, pp. 159- 81, to P.'s war vs. the pirates. xa Although Philemon is called a Syracusan by Suidas and an anonymous source (Kaibel, CGF i, p. 9, I6; see also RE s.v. Philemon, no. 7, col. 2137), the coinage of Pompeiopolis strongly suggests that the city in the second and third centuries A.D. agreed with the tradition recorded in the early Empire by Strabo (loc.cit.) that Soli was the birthplace of the comic poet. 2 According to Plutarch it had been "lately" (vaybXo,) devastated by Tigranes. Tigranocerta was constituted from twelve cities laid waste by Tigranes: Strabo, II. 14. 15 (532). - Script. Hist. Byz., George Syncellus, vol.

The com- mercial importance of the site from many centuries before the historical Soli, the inevitable aptness of its geographical position to trade, and the exclusively Roman nature of the ruins surviv- ing above ground, were indicated incidentally by Kurt Bittel in a recent article on a bronze age deposit found on the site in 1889 (Zeitschr. f.

Mellink).</page><page sequence="2">68 ALINE ABAECHERLI BOYCE [AJA 62 public to the middle of the third century A.D. Of the twenty-one pieces now in our collection,5 by far the most original is a large bronze of Antoninus Pius (pl. o0, i) bearing on its reverse the date G I = 209, the letter for "200" ([) following the letter for "9" (0), in accordance with the custom of cities in and near Syria. The 209th year of the Pompeian foundation has to be either 143/44 A.D. or 144/45, depending on whether the founda- tion year was 66/65 or 65/64 B.c.6 In any case the coin belongs to the reign of Antoninus Pius, whose laureate head appears on the obverse with the legend SAVK[AITAIAAAPAN]pTONEINOCC((V. The legend on the reverse is [nOMnHIO] nOAEITON * GE A AP. Although the identifying portion of the city's name is illegible, the identification can be taken as certain because the "f" on either side of the Emperor's head (only one shows here) was characteristic of coinage in the region of Tarsus, and the city for which our coin was struck must be a seaport whose name ends in nOAEITON. The coinage of no other city in the orbit of Tarsus meets these requirements. The stroke across the middle of the E is evidently the raised arm of a statue which forms part of the whole type, to which we shall now turn, for interpretation of the coin's reverse type is our particular interest in this paper. We see before us an elongated semicircular struc- ture apparently two stories high. Jar-like objects placed at regular intervals adorn the roof of the structure, and between the first two "jars" in the upper field is a single feather-shaped object rising above them. Filling the space within the structure is a figure reclining in the familiar manner of a river-god, though instead of a cornucopia or reed he holds a rudder6a at his right side, while his left arm rests not on the conventional jar pouring forth water but on a dolphin whose tail appears behind his left shoulder between the letters A and A of the legend.' Below this reclining figure are objects which may be either waves or fish. Their crude appearance suggests the latter, but the conventional representations of water deities, of which there are many,8 require that we regard these lines as waves representing water.9 There remain to be described the terminal points of the structure above and below the reclining fig- ure. On a base at the end of the structure above the figure's head is a male deity holding a long sceptre in his left hand. A base of a different nature, clearly circular, stands at the lower edge of the structure. This is higher than the base on which the statue stands and though it would seem to be a pharos or lighthouse, it may be an altar." A gouge in the coin crosses it obliquely at the top of this base and also mars the head of the dolphin on which the reclining figure rests his arm. The re- clining figure with rudder and dolphin as his at- tributes is, as we have suggested, clearly a water deity, and in a moment we shall try to identify him more exactly. His presence precludes the possi- bility that our structure is a stadium or circus:- for a stadium the building seems too short, and for a circus, too open at one end. The only other conceivable structure represented by this type is a harbor-the harbor of Pompeiopolis. This con- clusion surely receives certain confirmation from the existence of ruins of the harbor, which were sketched in connection with the expedition of the 5 Twenty coins came to us with the Newell Collection; an- other, published and illustrated by Imhoof, JHS i8 (1898) pl. xII, 13, was presented to us by Mr. Edward Ganz in 1954. 6 Though I may say here that I am inclined to accept the date-66/65 B.c. (67 is ruled out by numismatic evidence, vs. Pauly-Wissowa, s.v. aera, col. 645), in this paper we shall not consider the problem of the exact year of foundation. The extant monumental remains of the city appear to be from the middle of the second century and the third century A.D. (Pauly-Wissowa, supra note 4). 6a The occasional difficulty of distinguishing between rudder and oar is discounted in this paper as making little difference to the ideas discussed and because the rudder was certainly the adjunct intended in most cases. 7 '"A8pav4v" was an imperial epithet which P. shared with Tarsus and other Cilician cities, cf. BMCat. Lycaonia, Isauria, Cilicia, Index VII, p. 283, but its appearance on a coin of P. is exceptional. 8 See F. Imhoof-Blumer, Fluss-und Meerg6tter auf griech- ischen und r6mischen Miinzen (Genf 1924). 9 Cf. the waves on the coins illustrated on our pls. 14 and 15. 10 Cf. the altar at the end of the mole represented on a coin of Pescennius Niger struck at Caesarea Germanica (Bithynia), Recueil Gndral, I, 2 (Paris 1908) pp. 281-82, pl. 44, 5. In the Recueil this structure is called a pharos, but the photograph shows the carcass of a slain animal upon and dangling from the altar, perhaps the same creature as the bull lying in the foreground of the scene. The photograph is reproduced here, pl. 13, 10o. The structure on our coin of Pompeiopolis, if a pharos, is certainly simpler in form than the pharoi of Ostia (pl. 14, 5-6, 8-9), Alexandria (pl. 14, 7), Corinth and Laodicea ad Mare (pl. 14, 4 and 3). Careful consideration of these repre- sentations seems to be required. There appears to be no literary evidence to justify Anson's calling the tower of Hero on coins of Abydus (Numismata Graeca V, p. I6, pl. II, 107) a pharos, nor does it seem to me that the cylindrical object on the denarii of Sextus Pompey (BMCRep. II, 563-64) is unquestionably a pharos rather than a rostrate column with trophies of victory and a symbol-bearing, unmanned galley in the foreground.</page><page sequence="3">1958] THE HARBOR OF POMPEIOPOLIS 69 geographer Sir Francis Beaufort in the last cen- tury and published in Karamania, Sir Francis' account of the voyage along the southern coast of Asia Minor (our pl. II, fig. 4)." The rediscovery of the structure confirms the accuracy of our die- cutter in his delineation of the shape of the harbor. The "jars" on the coin may represent beacons set along the roof of the quai to light incoming ships at night or in bad weather. The "feather-like" object does not appear to have been intended for a palm leaf symbolic of games. Professor Gilbert Bagnani has made the very practical suggestion that it may be some sort of signal. It may be that it is really a sail acting as a weather vane and thus as a guide to incoming and departing ships.? Because the condition of the coin at this point is poor, the identification of the god on the base at the end of the structure is difficult. Our guess is that the statue represents either Neptune or the Emperor. The figure seems to hold a long sceptre rather than a trident and is comparable to the statue placed in a central position at the entrance to the harbor of Ostia represented on Nero's famous sestertii."3 But the identification of the figure reclining within the structure should be possible, for he is a general type most familiar to us as a river god though here associated with symbols belonging to deities of the sea, particularly the dolphin, but also the rudder. It is only natural to suppose that he is either Oceanus or the god of the harbor, and for this reason it will be useful to consider other represen- tations of water deities particularly connected with the sea or with harbors. Symbolic representation of the place where the river meets the sea seems to have found expression in anthropomorphic form on the coinage of the ancient Mediterranean only under the Roman Em- pire. The coinage of the Greek world knew many a river god, first part human, part animal in form (man-headed bulls, horned male deities, as, for instance, in Sicily); then there appeared later the famous little swimming figure, entirely human and particularly familiar from Cilician and Syrian coins, on which it was associated with the turreted Tyche or city goddess (cf. statues, J. Toynbee, The Hadri- anic School, pls. 28-30).""' Likewise gods of the sea other than Neptune were known from way back and appeared on the coinage. But deities specifically presiding over harbors seem to be comparatively late representations--of the Roman imperial period, in fact-and this, it may be said, would be consistent with the existence of city governments flourishing under conditions of relative prosperity and freedom to strike on their coinage types which permitted their self-glorification, as was the case under the Roman Empire. Except for Neptune, who is universal in time and place, river deities are more familiar to us from the imperial coinage than sea deities."4 They usually lay stretched out leaning on an overturned and overflowing urn or jar, and held a reed in one hand, a cornucopia against the opposite arm. Tiber and Nile are perhaps the most conspicuous examples both in statuary"5 and on the coinage. Less known rivers and springs such as the Sarnus in the wall- paintings of the domestic shrines at Pompeii" and the mysterious Pig? Sounias (pl. 15, I) on the coin- age of Pompeiopolis (Commodus and Caracalla)"7 11An outline form of the harbor (copied from a sketch in Sir Francis Beaufort's Karamania, ed. 2 [London i818] 249) appears as plan no. xxxviu in K. Lehmann-Hartleben's Die antiken Hafenanlagen des Mittelmeeres, Klio, Beiheft 14 (1923); Lehmann states (p. 204) that the form was a favorite with Hadrian. The fact that the city took Hadrian's name, which appears as AAP on our coin, and the assignment of monu- mental remains of Pompeiopolis to the second century, as well as the third (see Lehmann-Hartleben, p. 204 and note 4 above), suggest that Hadrian had a hand in the construction of harbor installations at Pompeiopolis, though completion and inaugura- tion may have taken place under his successor. For references to early works on Pompeiopolis see Lehmann-Hartleben's foot- notes on p. 204. 12 Cf. the wind-stockings at airports. There seems to be nothing in the pictorial representations of the ancient harbor of Puteoli (Ch. Dubois, Pouzzoles antique, Biblioth. des tcoles franfaises d'Athe'nes et de Rome, vol. 98, pp. 190-221) which would throw light on the "jars" and the "feather." 18 Similar figures appear on columns along the mole repre- sented on a glass vase in Lisbon (Ch. Dubois, above, note i2; H. Jordan, "Die Kiiste von Puteoli auf einem r6mischen Glass- gefass nebst einigen Reliefs von Capua," Arch.Zeit. 26 (i868) pl. II. s1a On this whole subject cf. J.

Our deity's dolphin associates him with the sea more truly than the rudder he holds, for some river deities held the rudder (pl. 15, 2, 3, 5, 6)."8 Rudder- bearing deities of the sea on Mediterranean coins of the imperial period were Oceanus and Thalassa, the former being named specifically at least in sev- eral cases, as at Ephesus and Tyre,"9 the latter's identification being clear from coins on which she is a foil to Ge, goddess of the earth, symbolizing land as opposed to sea (pl. 15, i8, 19).20 Both Oceanus and Thalassa seem invariably to carry the rudder, which is clearly a primary attribute. Thalassa invariably wears the crab-shell hat, while Oceanus only rarely wears it, usually being bare- headed like Neptune. As a secondary symbol Thalassa may bear an aphlaston or have a dolphin at her feet. Oceanus may merely be raising his free hand or holding an anchor. Thalassa usually stands (though not on pl. 15, 18 and i9), Oceanus lies. From evidence at hand it appears that water-deities bearing rudders were primarily associated with the sea;2" their names (sometimes given on the coins, as we have said), their secondary symbols, and their headgear point to this. But since it is also true that river gods sometimes bore rudders,22 the identifica- tion of our deity as a god of the sea results chiefly from the fact that he leans on a dolphin, not on an overturned and overflowing water jar, and from his position within the structure of the harbor. Now it could be said that any deity resembling Oceanus as does our god of Pompeiopolis must be Oceanus.22a But that there were harbor deities exist- ing in their own right is clear from the fact that on Corinthian coins of the imperial period two figures, each holding a rudder, are represented together, obviously personifications of the Corinthian har- bors on either side of the Isthmus, Cenchreae and Lechaeum (pl. 15, io and 13).23 With these per- sonifications as concepts separate from the general concept of "Ocean" can be compared their close relative Isthmus, who also holds the rudder, one when seated, two, symbolizing Cenchreae and Lechaeum, when standing (pl. 15, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14-16). A similar figure symbolizing "Fleet" (Stolos) is to be seen on coins of Nicomedia in Bithynia (pl. 15, 7) .24 As a consequence of the existence of harbor deities in their own right we may with confidence say that our reclining god is the presiding deity of the harbor of Pompeiopolis. Yet no other facsimile of a harbor known to me from the local coinage of the Roman Empire shows a rudder-bearing deity which closely resembles our figure. In fact other local coins which actually show plans of harbors reveal-and only vaguely-upright statues of deities such as we have at the upper right-hand segment of 1s See, for instance, pl. 15, I; 2-7. Cf. the observation of J. LeGall (note 13a) p. 29, note 5. 19 Imhoof-Blumer, Fl., p. 245, no. 560, pl. xviI, 2 (Ephesus); pp. 246-47, no. 563, pl. xvmII, 5 (Tyre; inscr. not very clear); the figure occurs on Roman Imperial coinage, e.g., a denarius of Septimius Severus, BMCEmp. V, p. 357, no. 5; pl. 53, 3. Of interest will be the appearance of a figure of Oceanus with rudder and anchor as a stucco relief in the Tomb of the Valerii found in the recently excavated Vatican cemetery (J. Toynbee and J. W. Perkins, The Shrine of St. Peter and the Vatican Excavations [London 1956] pl. 13). 20 See, for instance, our pl. 15, 18 and I9, zodiacal medallions with Zeus, Ge, and Thalassa, from Imhoof, Fl., pp. 243-44 (pl. xvni, 16 and 17); cf. pp. 241-42, 244 (pl. xvii, 12 and 18). It may not be irrelevant to note here that the point of contrast between land and water deities is different on the Badminton sarcophagus recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (published in detail by Christine Alexander, BMMA 14, no. 2 [Oct. 19551 39-47, who kindly provided me with a full bibli- ography), where Terra Mater lies at one end and a river deity at the other, symbolizing earth and water as life-sustaining powers. 21 The plentiful evidence for Scylla and the Tritons on coins and in sculpture supports this view. Tyche or Fortuna, the rudder-bearing deity most commonly represented on coins of the ancient Mediterranean, has no significance immediately pertinent to the present discussion. 22 See note 18. A noteworthy instance of a river-god bearing a rudder is to be seen in pl. 15, 2. Here, on a coin of Apollonia, dominating the scene which includes a ship above, i.e., in the background, and three men hauling an evergreen below in the foreground, lies a deity bearing a rudder and leaning on an overturned urn from which water flows. The figure must represent the Aous near its mouth, and the scene seems to symbolize the importance to one another of river, sea, ship- building and shipping. Mrs. Adra M. Newell has kindly allowed me to reproduce (pl. 15, 7) the rudder-bearing river-god among the reeds cut in the gem of a ring which belonged to E. T. Newell. Here is perhaps the place to ask what object is held in the r. hand of the figure representing the Pegai (sources of the Chrysorrhoas) on the third century A.D. coins of Damascus (pl. 15, 4). It has been called a number of things, among them "corn ears" and a "fish." That it is neither of these attributes seems to me certain; and while it might appear to resemble a torch, why should it not be a rudder (cf. Pege Sounias, pl. 15, I)? 22a And thus the figure is identified by J. LeGall (note 13a) p. 31, as well as by J. M. C. Toynbee, The Hadrianic School (Cambridge 1934) 139. 23 P1. 15, io shows their names clearly in an abbreviated form. The names are less clear on Imhoof, Fl., pl. xvIIm, 20. 24 Imhoof, Fl., pp. 242-43, regarded "Stolos" as the counter- part to a goddess he calls "Euploia," the goddess of navigation or fair voyage.

XIV, 917=IGRR I, 380, summarized infra note 64.</page><page sequence="5">1958] THE HARBOR OF POMPEIOPOLIS 71 our coin (see pl. io), but no reclining water deities leaning upon a dolphin (see pl. 13). A real parallel to our figure is to be found, however, in the strictly imperial coinage, on Nero's famous sestertii with their view of the harbor at Ostia (pl. Io, 2)."25 Here at the foreground of the scene showing the harbor filled with ships (the number of ships varies from seven to twelve)26 lies a figure similar to our Pom- peiopolitan figure, except that Deus Ostiensis holds the rudder before him, while Deus Pompeiopoli- tanus holds his rudder over his shoulder. The former was called "Tiber" by Sydenham (The Coinage of Nero [London 1920] p. io8), "Neptune" by Mat- tingly (BMCEmp. I, p. 221), "Oceanus" or "Hafen- gott" by Imhoof (Fluss- und Meerg6tter, p. 247).27 Whether or not this western and official evidence from the reign of Nero means that Nero's sestertius or an actual statue in the harbor at Ostia furnished a prototype for the deity of Pompeiopolis in the reign of Antoninus Pius, we at least have a second example of the reclining and rudder-bearing deity represented within the actual structure of a harbor.28 The evidence for Oceanus with a rudder as his symbol precludes the deity's being Neptune; the dolphin prevents him from being considered a river-god; our knowledge of the separate existence of harbor deities bearing the rudder therefore sug- gests that the deities of both Ostia and Pompeiopolis were the peculiar deities of the place where the rivers flowed into the ocean known as the Medi- terranean Sea.29" Striking confirmation of the identification of the deity as a harbor god can be derived from bronze coins of Alexandria, struck, oddly enough, under the very Emperor under whom our harbor piece of Pompeiopolis was struck, Antoninus Pius, in his eighteenth Alexandrian year, i.e., August 29, A.D. 154-August 28, A.D. 155, therefore ten years later than the Pompeiopolitan coin."3 To this date we shall return; for the moment we are interested in the type. The reverse of the Alexandrian coins seems clearly to have been intended to symbolize the meeting of the Nile and the Mediterranean, in other words, the harbor of Alexandria. Looking out toward the sea, which is suggested by a vessel under full sail, and away from the land, represented by a boat without sails (pl. 14, nos. i and 2) are two deities, one seated before the ship under sail, the other before the ship at anchor. Above and between these seated figures towers a statuesque goddess holding corn-ears and rudder, Euthenia in the form of the imperial Annona."3 The objects held by the goddess, like the ships on either side of her, symbolize the land and sea and their inter- dependence in the service of the imperial grain supply (annona). But it is not the rudder held by the goddess dominating the scene which is of chief importance for us here-for us this rudder is less important than the tiny rudder held upright within 25 BMCEmp. I, pp. 221-23, p. 235 note; pls. 41, 7 and 48, 2. The unusually fine specimen we reproduce in natural and en- larged sizes (pl. o10, 2) is a rare variety (eight ships) known to have been forged (see BMCEmp. I, p. 223, note) and which was not represented by a bona fide piece in the British Museum when BMCEmp. I was published. Two pieces with eight ships are listed in Cohen (Nero, 38, 40), another was in the Hall Collection (Glendining Sale Cat. Nov. 16-21, 1950, lot lo69). Our sestertius comes from the collection of the late Dr. Herbert E. Ives. It is a special pleasure to feature together in this article two unusual AE coins of former Presidents of the Society, Edward T. Newell and Herbert E. Ives. 26Cohen, Nero, 33-41; 250-54; BMCEmp. I, nos. 131-35; 323 and note on p. 223. According to this note, five and thirteen ships had been reported but apparently not authenticated. 27 Cf. A. W. VanBuren, "A Medallion of Antoninus Pius," IRS I (1911) 194, note 2 and L. R. Taylor, The Cults of Ostia, Bryn Mawr Diss. 1912, p. 35, where the special nature of the deity is recognized, though he is called Tiber. Counterfeits in our collection show that the forger was puzzled as to the identity of the rudder held by the god. 28 Perhaps too much should not be made of the fact that the tail of a huge dolphin and a colossal arm were found in the sea at Civitavecchia (G. Dennis, Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria [London 1883] II, p. 481), but it may well be that the ancient harbor of Centumcellae (see caption, plate 13, no. 12) had some such statue, too, an alternative possibility being of course a conventional representation of Neptune holding dolphin, a type particularly familiar from many coins. The arm and dolphin's tail are in the Bronze Room of the Etruscan Museum at the Vatican, as I have kindly been informed by Dr. F. Magi. 29 For harbor deities in general see Roscher, Lexicon, 2, 2, s.v. "Lokalpersonifikationen (Hafen)," cols. 2130-31 (the deity on Nero's coin is regarded as a harbor god, not Tiber) and the articles on Portunus in Roscher (cols. 2785-88) and in Pauly- Wissowa, 22, I, cols. 400-02. 30G.

Milne, Catalogue of Alexandrian Coins (Oxford 1933) 2288-2291 ("Isis Euploia," see p. xxix). 31 All other names for this goddess seem to me to fall away in the light of the imperial coinage, for "Annona" (Abundantia is of later date) is represented on the imperial coinage of Antoninus Pius with corn-ears, modius, and naval symbols, generally prow and anchor but also rudder and prow, in one case with the legend ANNONA AVG FELIX and prows, rudder, pharos, and tessera frumentaria.

What we evidently have on these Alexandrian documents is, if not a harbor god, the river Nilus unconventionally bearing a rudder in order to suggest the meeting of the river with the sea.32 What we see on these charming though homely coins of Alexandria appears to be the actual transformation of the river god into a harbor god who turns his gaze, along with another deity, per- haps Isis Pharia symbolizing the lighthouse in the harbor,33 in the direction in which his waters are flowing as they merge with the great Mediterranean. We shall return to these Alexandrian coins in a moment, for their date, as well as their type, is of interest to this paper. Why our remarkable coin of the Newell Collec- tion was produced at or for Pompeiopolis precisely in the year 209 of the Pompeian foundation of the city and in the reign of Antoninus Pius seems at first a mystery, but another Pompeiopolitan coin struck in the same year (209) may provide an ex- planation. We are lucky at this point to be dealing with dated coins, for the date is the only indication of the place of the coin in this series, since, instead of the Emperor's name and portrait, the obverse bears the name and portrait of the city's Roman founder, Pompey the Great.34 This exceptional feature makes the piece a commemorative, issue-- its date, the 209th year of the foundation perhaps need not be explained, but the combined facts of the date and commemorative obverse suggest that the coin was struck to honor the bicentenary of the Pompeian city's foundation. Since this anniversary actually occurred nine years previously, the delay between the actual anniversary and the issue of the commemorative coinage could be explained thus: that the issue came at the end of a ten-year period of celebration and coincided perhaps with the com- pletion of building projects such as the harbor represented on our coin of the same year. Such a ten-year period would have begun of course under Hadrian, who had in fact been travelling in the region about A.D. 130 and had left behind him projected building operations, among them new harbor installations.35 The appearance of his name on the reverse of our coin as a cognomen of the city-exceptional for Pompeiopolis-gives him some special relation to the issue doubtless connected with his travels." Our harbor coin, struck in the same year as an- other special issue honoring Pompey, may then be evidence for the exact year of the completion of a building program at Pompeiopolis, begun under Hadrian, possibly in anticipation of the Pompeian city's bicentenary. And there are further circum- stances to note concerning imperial harbors before we abandon the subject of the issue's occasion. We may remind ourselves, for instance, that the be- ginning of work on Claudius' harbor at Ostia took place a century earlier at the beginning of his reign (Dio 6o. ii); the building seems to have been well along in A.D. 46.7 The date of the completion of the harbor is uncertain, though there seems to be no sound reason to suppose that Claudius himself did not complete the structure just as the literary evidence, with other supporting evidence, indi- cates.38 In any case the date of our Pompeiopolitan 32 There is of course no inconsistency between the pairing off of a landward water deity with a sail-less boat and the fact that sailboats ply the Nile. 88 Vogt (see note 30) pp. 129-30, identified the deity as "Mediterranean," an attractive and proper concept comparable to Oceanus. But would "Mediterranean" be a goddess? A goddess is required for the figure under discussion by the evidence of good specimens I have seen. Isis Pharia, symbolizing the famous lighthouse on the island of Pharos, would be a fitting com- panion to Nilus in this setting. For fine examples of late im- perial coins linking Isis Pharia with a ship-bearing, reed-bearing Nilus, see A. Alfoeldi, A Festival of Isis in Rome under the Christian Emperors (Budapest 1937) pl. viii, I and pl. XIII, 23. 34 This coin-in the Newell Collection-will be published in the general catalogue of the coins of Pompeiopolis now in preparation. The commemorative coins struck under Antoninus Pius and M. Aurelius at Pompeiopolis, like the denarii of M. Aurelius and L. Verus commemorating the legionary denarii of Mark Antony, show the interest of the Antonines in honoring the great defeated men of the Republic. Under Domitian Pompey's portrait had already appeared on the coins of Pompei- opolis. We have recently been reminded of Pompey's reputation under the Empire by Pierre Grenade ("Le Mythe de Pomple et les Pompriens sous les C&amp;sars," Rev. 2tudes Anc. 52 [1950] 28-63). Hadrian visited Pompey's tomb, it will be recalled. 85 W.

The inscription is generally thought to have stood on the great travertine porticus of Claudius at Portus (see pl. 12). If this is correct, the construction of the harbor at that point at any rate must have been near completion-the date of the inscription is A.D. 46. That Claudius completed the harbor is stated by Suetonius (Claud. 20. 3) and Dio 6o. ii. 38 See note 37. Scholars persist in stating that the harbor was inaugurated by Nero in A.D. 54, recently, for instance, J. LeGall,</page><page sequence="7">1958] THE HARBOR OF POMPEIOPOLIS 73 coin of Antoninus Pius is a hundred years later than the period when the harbor at Ostia was under construction. Here is the place to note, moreover, that the Alexandrian harbor coins of Pius men- tioned above were struck in that Emperor's I8th Alexandrian year AD. 154/55, ten years later than the Pompeiopolitan coin,"9 and exactly a century from the date generally given as the date of the port's dedication, A.D. 54. This would appear to suggest that the Alexandrian coins had an anni- versary relation to Ostia. To this we shall return in a moment. There is more to the picture, however, than the possibility of an anniversary notion, for in the Alexandrian year of Pius just preceding (year 17, IZ) Alexandrian coins were struck with the legend TIBERIC OMONOIA encircling a scene in which Tiber, foot on prow, receives corn ears from Nilus.40 This concordia scene between the two river gods in A.D. 153/54 leaves little doubt that the Alexandrian harbor type struck in 154/55 envisioned the important relation of Alexandria to the imperial port at Ostia (Portus). What was the reason for the TIBERIC OMONOIA type, which apparently was never again used ?' 0 Why were the Annona coins with their stress on navigation and grain supply struck in 154/55? An anniversary re- lation to Ostia is a tempting reason for contempla- tion and intellectual sport, but we are bound, first of all, to search for a specific reason in contemporary history. And such a reason is indeed forthcoming. On the first day of the year 18 of Antoninus Pius in Egypt, August 29, 154, the prefect of Egypt, M. Sempronius Liberalis, issued an edict ordering the people to return to their homes under the security of amnesty (BGU II, 372; Wilcken, Chrest. i9). This act may or may not properly be linked to a revolt involving the assassination of Liberalis' prede- cessor,41 or to difficulties resulting from the failure of a harvest, but it seems certain that the edict was intended to effect as promptly as possible the re- sumption of production and the flow of grain and revenue to Rome. The command to the people to return to their homes (idia) without fear on the first day of the year 18 makes it clear that the dis- order which had brought about the decree must have occurred in the year 17, the year in which the TIBERIC OMONOIA coins were struck. Since the message of these coins is one of peace rather than of victory or triumph, it seems to me that their reference must be to the resumption of shipping or Le Tibre . . .dans l'antiquiti (Paris 1953) P. 130 and M. Stok- stad, Architecture on the Coins of Nero, Spink's Numismatic Circular, 1954, P. 391, remotely influenced mayhap by Dessau (CIL XIV, p. 6) who naturally made no analytical study of the coins or attempted to place them in their numismatic back- ground. Proof for a Neronian inauguration is, I believe, still wanting. In A.D. 48 Claudius went to Ostia sacrificii gratia (Tac. Ann. II. 26) and 7rpbs 6rlTKe/4Pv TTrou (Dio 61. 31. 4). These passages suggest an active harbor receiving grain ships and re- mind one of the medallions of Commodus and Diocletian show- ing the Emperor sacrificing at the lighthouse (pl. 14, 8 and 9). On the possible relation of Claudius' sacrifice to Castor and Pollux as gods protecting seafarers see L. R. Taylor, The Cults of Ostia, pp. 23-26. 39 The Alexandrian coin must be dated A.D. 154/55 (yr. 18); the Pompeiopolitan AE must be A.D. 143/44 or 144/45. 40 BMCAlexandria, 1167; Dattari, 2782; Vogt, p. 81. There is a specimen of the homonoia type at the American Numismatic Society, but its condition is too poor for satisfactory reproduction. A good reproduction (from Imhoof-Blumer, Fl. pl. xv, no. 26) can be found in J. LeGall's Recherches sur le culte du Tibre (Paris 1953) pl. xiim. TIBERIS, reclining with reed, jar, and prow, had appeared on imperial bronze struck at Rome in COS III (A.D. 140-44). It is worth noting that LeGall suggests a Hadrianic dating for the colosssal and recumbent statues of Nile and Tiber found in the region of the Iseum Campense in Rome (op.cit. pp. 3-4; 20-22). LeGall appears to be in error, however, in dating the Alexandrian issue of Tiber and Nile in A.D. I52-53 (p. 30). Pius' seventeenth year at Alexandria (IZ) was 153/54. 40a It had appeared ten years earlier in the year Z (Imhoof- Blumer, Fl. p. 214, no. 504, pl. xv, 26), a date (A.D. 143/44) which might suggest that the type was created for a centenary commemoration of the first steps taken by Claudius for the construction of the harbor at Ostia. Serious consideration of such a theory, however tempting, seems to me secondary to a search into the events of Antonine history for the issue's occasion- mayhap harbor construction at Alexandria itself! 41 For this picture the evidence of a passage from Malalas (11. 367, p. 280; cf. SHA Pius 5, 5) which mentions the assassination of a prefect of Egypt and a subsequent victorious campaign against the Egyptians is combined with the evidence of BGU. 372 (Wilcken, Chrest. no. 19, pp. 31-34), an edict of the new prefect, M. Sempronius Liberalis, A.D. 154 (cf. Grenfell and Hunt, Fayum Towns and Their Papyri [London 1900] 131, no. 24, A.D. 158) ordering the Egyptians to return to their homes under amnesty. For further discussion see the references in Krebs' edition of BGU. 372 and P. M. Meyer, "Papyrusbeitrige zur r6mischen Kaisergeschichte," Klio 7 (1907) 123-37. Against a revolt is F. Schehl, "Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Kaisers Antoninus Pius," Hermes 65 (1930) 193-208, who finds no need to explain Liberalis' edict or the Alexandrian coins thus but considers their issue the aftermath of a crop failure. Indeed part of Malalas' account, at any rate, seems to refer to Caracalla, not Antoninus Pius (cf. BMCEmp IV, p. xxxvi, note I), and an asssumption that Malalas was writing of Caracalla seemed to Schenk von Stauffenberg, after a comprehensive analysis of the documents ("Die r6mische Kaisergeschichte bei Malalas [Stuttgart 1931] 307-13 and 313, note 55a), "die eleganteste und iiberzeugendste Lisung des Problems." The evidence for the Prefect M. Sempronius Liberalis can be found in A.

In any case some such reason must be given the first, and, if neces- sary, only place in the search for the raison d'etre of these coins. If we knew the exact date of the completion or dedication of the port of Ostia, the story might be different, and an anniversary issue for Ostia might be postulated. For in view of the wide publicity that has been given the theory of anniversary issues in recent books on the Roman coinage,42 it is now impossible to refrain here from noting that the year 154/55 in which the Alex- andrian harbor coins of Pius were struck, the year after Tiber appeared with Nilus on the Alexandrian coinage, was one hundred years from the date traditionally accepted as the time of the completion or dedication of the Claudian port of Ostia. Yet since this tradition has been more precise and per- sistent than the evidence seems to warrant, it may be worth our trouble to review the evidence. Literary evidence says that Claudius completed the harbor. Now the traditional date for the com- pletion of the harbor or a dedication of it by Nero rests only, so far as I know, on the sestertii of Nero which show and name the harbor but give no in- dication of the occasion for the selection of the type (pl. io, 2). The sestertii are to be dated no earlier than A.D. 63/64, probably in 64/65, and from these coins having a date post quem through comparison with other coins of Nero,43 it has been concluded that Nero had more to do with the building of the port than our present knowledge admits. Al- most no Neronian construction has yet been found at Ostia or Portus; at Portus there is evidence for the building of Claudius, Trajan, and Septimius Severus. It seems hardly possible that Nero com- pleted the harbor,"4 though he is said to have dumped rubble from the fire of 64 into the Ostian marshes and initiated plans for further works, par- ticularly a canal to bring the ships to Rome through Campania (Tacitus Ann. 15.42-43; Suetonius, Nero 31; cf. 16) rather than by sea. Tacitus speaks of traces of the project surviving in his day,45 and remains of it have been found at Sabaudia. The inauguration of the Claudian port in the sense of its actual use can hardly have been postponed pending the fulfilment of Nero's grandiose plans4" -an unrecorded formal inauguration could have taken place under Claudius and may not enter into the Neronian numismatic picture at all. The exist- ence of plans transcending the work of Claudius, like the building of Porto in the reign of Trajan (pl. 12 and pl. 13, 12), may indicate that Claudius' harbor had not the necessary capacity for efficient use."4 In any case, the fascinating but perhaps mis- leading sestertii may be no more than one set of Nero's beautiful new bronze coinage rather than monuments of a late completion or dedication of the port, and the institution of the whole new bronze series may of course be a decennial affair of the reign.47a Yet since Annona types appear in the new AE series,"4 we know that the administration had the grain supply in mind, and the fact that this is Annona's first appearance on the coinage en- 42Especially M.

Strack, Untersuchungen zur r'mischen Reichsprdgung des zweiten Jahrhunderts, had previously made reference to the possibility of anniversary issues. 43 E.g., gold and silver with the numbers of Nero's tribunicia potestas up to X; a few bronze pieces bearing TR P numbers (cf. BMCEmp. I, pp. 214-17 and clxviii); silver of Alexandria, where the year Io (I) shows a distinct transition from the portrait of the boy to the coarser but more mature portrait of the young man. See note 49. 44 See note 37. 4 Ann. I5.42: manentque vestigia inritae spei. Nero evi- dently had other projects on his mind, such as a canal through the isthmus of Corinth (Dio, 62.16) and baths at Alexandria in anticipation of a visit to that city (id. 62.18). 46 See notes 37 and 38. The port of Puteoli of course con- tinued to function at this time and thereafter-we have in fact from the pen of Seneca (Epist. 10.1.77) a vivid description of the excitement caused by the arrival there of the advance ships of the fleet ("tabellariae," the packet or mail boats) during the period of Seneca's self-imposed exile toward the end of his life (A.D. 62-65): indeed the passage forms the introduction to his essay to Lucilius on suicide). 47 Coordination of the functioning of the harbors at Puteoli and Ostia seems to have been in the process of development under Claudius and Nero. Fire-protection agencies in both cities were established by Claudius (Suet. Claud. 25). The existence of an official distributor of grain whose duties evidently covered both Ostia and Puteoli under Antoninus Pius (CIL X, 1562) and the preponderance of eastern merchants recorded at Puteoli and western shippers at Ostia (note particularly the inscriptions in mosaic of the Piazzale delle Corporazioni; on the whole subject see Dubois, supra note 12, pp. 83-III) tend to indicate that coordination of the two ports for efficient docking and distribution was part of imperial policy in post-Neronian times, and it may be suggested that such coordination rather than complete madness lay back of Nero's abandoned project of a canal from Campania to Rome. Nero was not, after all, the only emperor to have advanced an impossible project: Claudius himself is reported to have failed in a project to drain the Fucine Lake into the Liris (Dio 60. I I). 47a Vogt (p. 31) points out that the introduction of Nero's large Alexandrian AE occurred in the year Io (A.D. 63164). 48BMCEmp. I, pp. 220-21, 260.</page><page sequence="9">1958] THE HARBOR OF POMPEIOPOLIS 75 hances her importance in the issue. It also suggests a meaning for the harbor coins. Claudius is expressly stated to have built the harbor as a statesmanlike act to maintain a steady grain supply for posterity as well as for the present generation (Dio 6o.ii). Annona's advent to the coinage would seem there- fore to be connected with the harbor. It may be that the coins simply celebrate the arrival of a grain fleet in the harbor-or more significant still-the steady arrival of the grain fleet. There are general circumstances into which these types fit which have no reference to the completion or inauguration of the port. They deserve consideration though their real merits will have to await the severe judgment of whoever becomes expert in the whole coinage of Nero and the last years of his reign. Along with the vast clearing and building program initiated after the great fire in the summer of A.D. 64 (Tacitus, Ann. 15.42-43) there must have been a tremendous increase in the production of aes coinage, heretofore neglected in the reign of Nero, though perhaps planned and begun before the disaster. Most of the AE coinage known to us certainly comes from the years following the fire. How the fire affected the supply of coin is not known, but that little bronze coinage had been struck before 64, is I think gen- erally admitted, so clear is this from general prin- ciples deriving from the coinage itself."9 The need for new coin cannot have been lessened by the fire. It may yet turn out that some at least of the types of the fine new bronze coinage, including the har- bor type, reflect measures taken to rebuild Rome morally along with the physical reconstruction. The necessities of life were to be provided, and the city was to be rebuilt and made safer."0 A vast city- planning program is described in detail (Tac. Ann. 15-43). It is easy to lose sight of what was happen- ing in a constructive way during these years when the Emperor's personal dissolution continued apace and unimpeded.,oa No more may be expressed through Nero's harbor type than the propaganda of a new harbor full of ships coming from Alex- andria to maintain the city's food supply at a time of dire distress. The meaning, then, of Nero's har- bor type must be derived first from its relation to other coins in the series to which it belongs. The type cannot in the present state of our knowledge be shown to have had reference more specific than one generally propagandistic in Nero's own day.50b There is then little evidence for anniversary mean- ings to be found in these coins, yet the possibilities are worth keeping in mind for those issues which bear dates, namely the coinage of Pompeiopolis and Alexandria. For the coins most likely to pro- vide evidence of anniversary issues are surely the dated coins. It seems to me that the search for anni- versary issues properly begins here. That the coin- ages themselves-both at Alexandria and at Pom- peiopolis-were commemorated by the immediate successors of Pius is clear from the existence of Alexandrian harbor types of Marcus and Verus dated exactly ten years after the issues of Pius, A.D. 164/65, the fifth year of the reign," and of 49 For the dating of Nero's aes, BMCEmp. I, pp. clxvi-clxx. Some fresh comment may be added: most of the bronze coinage of Nero-of which our harbor type is an example-shows the bangs of the Emperor turned outward and plastered closely to the forehead. This style of coiffure may be suggested in the earlier coinage, but it appears conspicuously and fully developed first in TR P X (63/64) on aurei and denarii; likewise it ap- pears in the year I(lo), A.D. 63/64, on the coinage of Alex- andria. It seems to be commoner on the Alexandrian coinage of the year IA (A.D. 64/65), and though after that date it is often disregarded by Alexandrian die-sinkers, who seem to have reverted to the traditional head, the brief appearance of this detail of Nero's coiffure at Alexandria provides a check for the dating of the imperial bronze with this feature. The few dated bronzes of Nero show it, and with rare exception, all of his bronze coinage shows it. The combined evidence of Nero's dated and undated coins in the precious metals, his bronze coinage, and the coinage of Alexandria, point to TR P X and Alexandrian imperial year I (not precisely synchronous but both covering portions of 63 and 64) as the first year of this coiffure in its fully developed form, to 64/65 and later (in other words, after the fire) as the period of its general use. 50 To the evidence of the annona and harbor coinage we may add Tacitus, Ann. 15. 39 and 43. soa Cf. C. H. V. Sutherland, Coinage in Roman Imperial Policy 31 B.C.-A.D. 68, pp. 162-64; M. Grant, "Nero; the Two Versions," History Today 4 (1954) 319-25. 50b The harbor and Annona types might have been intended to counteract reports such as Suetonius recorded in Nero 45: Ex annonae quoque caritate lucranti adcrevit invidia; nam et forte accidit, ut in publica fame Alexandrina navis nuntiaretur pulverem luctatoribus aulicis advexisse. 51 With Euthenia-Annona bearing cornucopia instead of rudder: Dattari, 3459-61, Marcus; BMCAlexandria, 8o8, Hunter Cat. 543, Verus; repeated in the year 9: Feuardent, 2071, Marcus; Dattari, 3725bis, Verus; cf. Vogt II, p. 0o2. At the ANS we have a coin of L. Verus, year 5, with Annona bearing rudder, apparently struck before the cornucopia was substituted for the rudder in Annona's arm in that same year. Its excellent condition, its size and the smoothness of its flan have recently given me some qualms about its genuineness, though I had published it for this reverse in Archaeology (1949) p. 183, 19. It is therefore reassuring that C. H. V. Sutherland, who kindly examined this coin at my request when he was in New York during this past summer (1957), has formed the opinion that it is to be accepted as authentic in spite of certain differences from the general run of Alexandrian pieces. "What seems to militate against that [its authenticity]," writes Dr. Sutherland, "is mainly the weight (and size); but this of course is mainly due to the fact that it is very little worn and totally uncorroded-</page><page sequence="10">76 ALINE ABAECHERLI BOYCE [AJA 62 Pompeiopolitan issues of the same reign honoring Pompey exactly twenty years after the coinage struck by Pius in honor of Pompey.2 The Alex- andrian harbor issue of Marcus and Verus was repeated in the year 9 (0)."3 Its first occurrence-in 164/65-is connected by Vogt (p. 140) with the famine which was a threat during and after the Parthian War (A.D. 163-66), just as he associated Commodus' later ship-and-Pharos type with a fam- ine of A.D. I89 (p. I54). Certainly the importance of the harbor and the anxiety felt about dependence on it for the "Alexandrina frumenta" resulted in the formation by Commodus of a new grain fleet plying from the African coast (SHA. Comm. XVII, 7-8).53a But was the scene on the coins of Marcus and Verus suggested to officials who selected the coin types by the fact that the series of Antoninus Pius on which it was based had been struck just ten years earlier? And were imperial officials conscious of the fact that these issues were being struck about a century after the issuing of Nero's sestertii show- ing the harbor of Ostia? All of the foregoing discussion affords interesting speculation regarding the chronology of imperial events based on the evidence of dated or datable harbor coins. Whether or not any or all of these coins have a real or intended commemorative qual- ity, we have tried to point out possible events repre- sented by them and relations between them, pur- poseful or accidental. Having disposed of the ques- tions of chronology, specific and speculative, we are now ready to assign our harbor issues their place in the reign of Antoninus Pius. Here we are on firm ground. Literary evidence and inscriptions show that the construction or restoration of harbors was part of a broad policy put into action by Pius, and that, far from being an isolated phenomenon of the reign, our coin of Pompeiopolis, though new evi- dence and numismatically phenomenal, is but one of the various kinds of documents showing that Pius, following in the steps of Trajan and Hadrian, had great concern for the condition of the Empire's harbors. Among the harbors to which he gave at- tention were Puteoli,54 Caieta,5" and Terracina." All of these were Italian ports. But he also restored "Farus,"" and since this name was primarily ap- plied to the great Pharos on the island of that name at Alexandria and there seems to be no particular reason to suppose that the lighthouse at Ostia (Portus) was meant,"8 we can only conclude that the lighthouse restored by Pius may well have been the great Egyptian one.59 There seems to be an extraordinary number of Alexandrian coins of Pius showing the Pharos. Attention to the rebuilding of the Pharos at Alexandria may have followed the cordial sentiments on the river and harbor coinages of 153/54 and 154/55. In any case, from literature, inscriptions, and coins we have a splendid array of unlike the vast majority of Alexandrian bronze. It is quite certainly a struck piece: its flan, as with Alexandrians of the same period, was cast in a chain of moulds: the portrait style is closely comparable with that of other coins of the period: the slight 'cupping' on the reverse, while unusual, can likewise be paralleled: and the phenomenon of a circular reverse die smaller in diameter than the flan is also to be seen in the same trays. That, then, leaves only the type-variation, which is surely not impossible to accept: incidentally there are no apparent signs of tooling." 52 Of several specimens known to me, one of the two Paris (Cabinet des M6dailles) pieces clearly bears the date OKC(229). 63See note 51. 53a See also Vogt, pp. 154-55 and infra note 64. 54 CIL X, I640 (Dessau 336), letters of original inscription recut in Renaissance times: Imp.

The date of the inscription, A.D. 139, as well as the precise statement of its content, shows that the restoration of the mole was the execution of a project planned in the previous reign. Nothing could illustrate better Pius' intention to complete works undertaken by Hadrian than the content and the date of this inscription. 55 SHA Pius 8, 2-3: opera eius haec extant: Romae templum Hadriani honori patris dicatum, Graecostadium post incendium restitutum, instauratum amphitheatrum, sepulchrum Hadriani, templum Agrippae, pons sub[p]licius; Fari restitutio, Cai[a]et- &lt;a&gt; e portus, Terracinensis portus restitutio, lavacrum Ostiense, Antiatium aquae ductus, templa Lanuviana. multas etiam civi- tates adiuvit pecunia, ut opera vel nova facerent vel vetera restituerunt, ita ut et magistratus adiuvare[n]t et senatores urbis ad functiones suas. 56 See note 55- 57 See note 55. 58 Unless the special Annona issue (ANNONA AVG FELIX BMCEmp. IV p. 267, I655, pl. 40, I, and Introd. p. lxxxvi) showing the lighthouse of Ostia is to be linked to this passage with confidence. The passage on Pius' building activities was quoted in full in note 55 in order that the reader may evaluate it for himself. There will be those who will argue that the lighthouse at Ostia (Portus) was meant because only Italian towns appear in the passage; but if the lighthouse at Ostia was meant, why was "Fari restitutio" separated from "lavacrum Ostiense"? And, so far as I know, there have as yet been found no traces of Antonine work at Portus. 91 I do not, however, find reference to the passage from SHA Pius 8, 2-3 in H. Thiersch, Pharos Antike Islam und Occident (Leipzig I909). On p. 1I, however, he notes that the coins of Pius show no change in the Pharos. He also points out that on some coins of Pius a small serpent appears on the sail of the ship of Isis Pharia, apparently indicating the home port, as presumably do the wolf and twins represented twice on the sail of a ship on the famous Torlonia relief found at Portus.</page><page sequence="11">1958] THE HARBOR OF POMPEIOPOLIS 77 evidence for an Antonine policy of harbor con- struction to which to add our coin of Pompeiopolis. It shows that Antoninus Pius was truly concerned for the harbors outside Italy as well as the Italian ports and in this respect he was continuing a Hadri- anic movement. It looks, moreover, as though a general plan of imperial harbor construction in the provinces, inspired by Hadrian and carried on by Antoninus Pius, was somehow being tied in with the history of the port of Ostia-itself recently ex- panded by Trajan,6O who also created a harbor at Centumcellae (Civitavecchia) and reconstructed the harbor at Ancona (CIL, IX, 5894). We seem to be in the full tide of a great movement of imperial scope the end purpose of which was to bring the eastern harbors closer to Rome and to one another. Since connections between harbor and harbor can be found in earlier tradition, there would be noth- ing inconsistent with tradition in our finding rela- tions between the various imperial harbors in the second century. For it is specifically stated that Claudius built the lighthouse at Ostia in imitation (the idea, not the exact form) of the Pharos at Alexandria,"6 and that the ship which brought Caligula's obelisk to Rome and Vatican Hill was sunk by Claudius to form the base of the mole at Ostia on which the lighthouse was established.62 These were the monumental links between Alex- andria and the first imperial port of Ostia. They were symbolic as well as practical links, reminding the Romans of their dependence on the grain supply from Egypt as well as on the delivery of that cargo in a safe port at home. Now we have already pointed out the similarity in form of the harbor god of Pompeiopolis and the deity lying within the harbor at Ostia as represented on our coin. This is the link between the imperial harbor at Ostia and the harbor of Pompeiopolis. We have no absolute certainty that the figures on the coins were real rather than symbolic, but just as imperial Rome borrowed the Pharos from Ptolemaic Alexandria, so the provincial city Pompeiopolis may have de- rived her harbor deity from the harbor of the im- perial capital, behaving by such an act with greater flattery toward the capital city than some of its ancestral pirates, who might well have been among the band which, as Cicero tells us, had made a raid on Ostia before Pompey put an end to their buccaneering."6 In any case, it remains a fact that the harbor gods of Ostia and Pompeiopolis were similar in concept, form, and position. That there might be a closer relation between harbors and gods than is obvious from the separate numismatic documents struck so far apart in time and space may be suggested by the fanciful but wholly prag- matic meeting of Tiber and Nile in the numismatic narrative of Alexandria in the year A.D. 153/54.64 The harbors saw the exchange of ideas as well as of goods, and it is clear from this single example that real truths of history may be derived from the 60 The interest of the emperors of the second century in adorning Ostia itself is clear from the city's buildings and inscriptions and was noted long before the excavations had reached their present state (L. R. Taylor, The Cults of Ostia, p. Io). 61 Suetonius, Claud. 20. 3: Portum Ostiae exstruxit circum- ducto dextra sinistraque brachio et ad introitum profundo iam solo mole obiecta; quam quo stabilius fundaret, navem ante demersit, qua magnus obeliscus ex Aegypto fuerat advectus, congestisque pills superposuit altissimam turrem in exemplum Alexandrini Phari, ut ad nocturnos ignes cursum navigia dirig- erent. That the form was different is clear from the evidence of coins, tesserae, and sculptural reliefs. It is worth noting here for the relation of harbor to harbor and the influence of the Pharos (destroyed by an earthquake only in 1326) through- out the Mediterranean that Thiersch (supra note 59) p. 5, compares the Campanile of S. Marco at Venice to the Pharos and says that the first relics in S. Marco were brought from Alexandria to Venice. 62 Suetonius, Claud. 20. 3; Pliny N.H. I6. 202. Pliny speaks of the wonderful fir which had provided the mast for this ship so fittingly immortalized by interment within the monumental harbor works. 63 Cicero, de imperio Cn. Pompei, 33: "Pro di immortales! tantamne unius hominis incredibilis ac divina virtus tam brevi tempore lucem afferre rei publicae potuit, ut vos, qui modo ante ostium Tiberinum classem hostium videbatis, ii nunc nullam intra Oceani ostium praedonem navem esse audiatis?" And just previously, "Nam quid ego Ostiense incommodum .... querar .... " In advocating the passage of the Manilian Law to extend Pompey's power Cicero recalled the recent piratical depredations to which Pompey had put an end and expressed in brief and simple terms the basic importance of their harbors to the Romans: portus quibus vitam et spiritum ducitur; cf. H. M. Tomlinson in London River, "the sea keeps us going, the tidal river is London's origin, life, and circula- tion." So for New York the East River, particularly at full tide, may be thought of as a symbol of the interdependence of harbor and river in their function as water bridges joining land of supply to land of need. 64 The close association between Ostia and Alexandria was noted by Lehmann, Hafenanlagen, p. 189. The following are some connections not mentioned in the text and chiefly later than the time of Antoninus Pius: the Serapaeum at Portus was modelled on the great Serapaeum at Alexandria (L. R. Taylor, The Cults of Ostia, p. 74); Commodus sacrificed beside the lighthouse in the presence of the fleet and Serapis (pl. 14, 8, this paper), whose temple was close to the sea (Minucius Felix, Octavius, 2. 4); the head of the whole Alexandrian fleet, a neocoros of Serapis, made a dedication near Portus for the Salus of Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Julia Domna, and their whole house, and for the fair voyage of the whole fleet, and dated the dedication, moreover, by the prefecture of the annona (IG XIV, 917 = IGRR I, 380).</page><page sequence="12">78 ALINE ABAECHERLI BOYCE [AJA 62 fanciful representation of dramatic episodes in the life of the Empire on its coinage. Though Nero and Trajan brought the harbor of Rome to the imperial coinage issued in the West,65 it was apparently in the Antonine era, a period of harbor reconstruction, that harbors of the East be- gan to appear on the coinage in a form comparable to Nero's type. These elaborate schemata of harbors on coins of the imperial period with their details of ships, lighthouses and statuary contrast sharply with the simple form of the harbor of Zancle on the early coins of that city, where the dolphin alone represents the sea within the encircling struc- ture or "sickle-shaped" band (pl. 13, I and 2). The Pompeiopolitan bronze of Antoninus Pius adds fresh evidence to the group of imperial coins which show us the schemata, the buildings, and the statues of harbors in the ancient Mediterranean world. It almost certainly confirms Lehmann's dating of the harbor as not much later than Hadrian (Hafenan- lagen, p. 204: "wohl nicht viel spaiter"). It provides evidence which will be helpful in a study of the city's dated coins as a group and for the study of dated coins in general. It contributes, moreover, through its reverse legend, on the one hand, and its obverse as a whole, on the other, to the tradition of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius in the East as re- vealed by the coins, and to the tradition of harbors as represented on all forms of ancient art. Finally, if confirmation were necessary, it would appear to confirm the identification of the ruins visited by Sir Francis Beaufort and his expedition as the re- mains of the ancient city of Pompeiopolis, the erstwhile Soli.66 Sir Francis' plan (Karamania, ed. 2, London i818, p. 249) shows the remains of Pompeiopolis as the expedition found them (see note ii and pl. ii, fig. 4)-a harbor closely re- sembling the form of the structure on our coin. We are told that the great beauty of the ancient harbor was the first thing that caught the eyes of the approaching English voyagers.67 The magnifi- cent mole was reported to be fifty feet in thickness,68 and from the noble structure a colonnade passed into the town. The site is now desolate. What further excavation might produce, and whether the sea or the sand might yet surrender any trace of the harbor's statues, may well be left for future generations to discover. It does no harm, nevertheless, to hope that something more may come to light in our day,69 if only a hoard of coins bearing perhaps new types, perhaps new dates. Meanwhile, I should appreciate receiving (c/o The American Numismatic Society, Broadway and i55th Street, New York 32, N.Y.) information about the coins of Pompeiopolis in public or private collec- tions, since I am compiling a catalogue of the issues of this city of the Roman period. THE AMERICAN NUMISMATIC SOCIETY, NEW YORK 65 In the late Empire Nero and Trajan are together associated with the port of Ostia on contorniates: the name and what is intended to be the portrait of the divine Trajan appears on the obverse, and Nero's Ostia type is crudely imitated on the reverse (A. Alfoeldi, Die Kontorniaten, p. 52 and no. 395, pls. 66, 9-II; 67, 1. For an example recently acquired by the Ameri- can Numismatic Society see Sammlung Apostolo Zeno Sale Cat., [Vienna 1956] pl. 8, 2634). 66 The destruction of the ruins of the city through pilfering and vandalism was decried by traveler after traveler in the nineteenth century and reached a climax in the woeful tale told by R. Paribeni and P. Romanelli as a result of their visit in 1913 (Monumenti Antichi, 23 [1914] cols. 87-90) when they found bits of two aqueducts, twenty-four columns flanking a road, and nomadic shepherds prepared to speed the destruction. In spite of the sad state of the ruins and the scarcity and poor condition of the inscriptions on the spot, trustworthy records show that dedications transcribed in the area or reported to have once been in the area were made by the people of Pom- peiopolis. No traveler seems ever to have doubted the identity of the site, and we may, on the strength of the inscriptions found in situ or reported to have come from these ruins, leave their judgment unquestioned. Our coin, with its reproduction of the general plan of the harbor, supports that judgment. 67 Beaufort, Karamania, p. 259. 68 The width of the mole, according to Lehmann (p. 205) is to be explained by its having carried the city wall, which appears to have enclosed the harbor. 69 Cf. K. Bittel, on p. 204 of the article cited in note 4: "Alle zusammen (bronze age finds on the southern coast of Asia Minor) entstammen fast durchweg Zufallsfunden und beweisen nur, wie aussichtsreich eine sorgfiltige archdologische Erforschung der Kiistengebiete wire, die bisher stets durch- widrige Umstinde verhindert worden ist." It is clear, then, that our hopes for further excavation at Pompeiopolis are shared by scholars interested in a period far more remote than the time of Roman domination.</page><page sequence="13">BOYCE PLATE IO ILI' V .!

III, Introd. p. civ, Strack's identification of the harbor with that of Ostia, i.e., Portus (Untersuchungen zur romischen Reichsprdgung des zweiten Jahrhunderts, 2, pp. 212-13) as against Centumcellae is questioned on grounds of insufficient evidence. But the schema of the remains of Trajan's harbor at Portus (pl. 12) is, in spite of apparent deviations, identical with that of the coin-hexagonal. This can be seen by looking at the inner outline of the harbor on the coin and comparing it with the plan of Portus in Lugli-Filibeck, II Porto di Roma Imperiale e l'Agro Portuense (Rome 1935) pl. ii (see our pl. i2). Cf. also the plans for Portus and Centumcellae in Lehmann's Hafenanlagen, plans xxx and xxxiii, 12, and p. 239 (the latter is clearly not a hexagon) and G.
