<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Svobodnaia veshch"'": Poetika neostraneniia u Andreia Platonova. By Ol'ga Meerson. Oak- land, Calif.: Berkeley Slavic Specialties, 1997. 137 pp. Appendix. Bibliography. Index. Illustrations. Plates. Paper. The criticism that comprises the burgeoning "Platonov industry" can be roughly divided into two camps: primacy is given either to philosophy and theme or to the author's inge- nious, deliberately clumsy style, while only the occasional exception (such as Thomas Seifrid's Andrei Platonov: Uncertainties of Spirit, 1992) manages to balance both. Ol'ga Meer- son's new book, "Svobodnaia veshch"', is such an exception. Basing her argument on close textual analysis, Meerson develops a model that does much to explain, not only Platonov's peculiar style, but also the ethical dimensions of such important works as Chevengur and The Foundation Pit. Meerson's approach is based on a neologism of her own devising: "neostranenie," which could be roughly (and poorly) translated as "unestrangement" or "familiarization." Unlike the well-known formal device identified by Viktor Shklovskii, the formal trick posited by Meerson does not force the reader to look at something familiar as if it were new; rather, neostranenie disguises shocking or unfamiliar phenomena and information by passing them off as ordinary and unremarkable. Meerson argues that neostranenie, which is at the heart of Andrei Platonov's poetics, is a strategy that acts upon the readers themselves, at times even rendering them complicit in the ethical lapses of the novel's characters (though perhaps ultimately in order to increase the moral shock experienced by Platonov's more attentive readers). To a large extent, Meerson's project is a struggle against neostranenie in that the very process of exposing the inner workings of this device reverses its effects. The result is that Meerson lets us know about Platonov what we already knew unconsciously but were perhaps never able to formulate properly: Platonov keeps his readers off-guard by presenting the most nonsensical (and at times, horrible) events as if they were everyday, and provides new information as if we already knew it. Meerson's examples are particularly instructive in that they explain some of the most puzzling moments in Platonov's work. As readers of The Foundation Pit will recall, halfway through the novel a strangely anthropomorphic bear appears; no one seems surprised that the bear performs the tasks of an ordinary human laborer, and none of the characters hes- itates to ascribe to the bear such unlikely traits as "class consciousness." Meerson pays close attention to the sentence that introduces the bear: "Kuznets kachal mekhom vozdukh v gom, a medved' bil molotom po raskalennoi zhelemoi polose na nakoval'ne." She notes that, according to the rules of Russian syntax, the sentence is structured as an answer to the question "What was the bear doing?" rather than "Who was working in the smithy with the blacksmith?" The word medved', which would normally be the rheme, is instead the theme, meaning that the proper English translation of the word should be "the bear"</page><page sequence="2">948 Slavic Review rather than "a bear" (23). Thus Platonov's syntax conveys and reproduces the attitude of the bureaucrat Pashkin and the hard-working Chiklin, who take the bear's presence for granted. For Pashkin, the identity of this "worker" is far less important than the function he fulfills, as well as his role in the "class struggle." Humanity (or the lack thereof) is of little importance. Meerson's book is filled with such insightful observations based on close textual analy- sis and her theory of neostranenie (particularly noteworthy is her discussion of the "bour- geois woman in the barrel" in Chevengur, as well as her treatment of the strange manner in which we learn of the deaths of Safronov and Kozlov in The Foundation Pit). Perhaps not surprisingly, Meerson's analysis of the ethical implications of Platonov's neostranenie in re- lation to death and murder culminates in a discussion of a slip of the tongue in Cheven- gur that has been noted by other scholars before: when Piusia explains to Kopenkin that the local bourgeoisie had been slaughtered by the Chevengurian communists, he says that this act was done on the order of the obychaika. Kopenkin immediately supplies the correct word, chrezvychaika, extraordinary committee, but Piusia's "mistake" is a textbook example of linguistic and moral neostranenie: he replaces the extraordinary with the ordinary. Such examples are useful, not only to Platonov scholars, but to anyone who has ever tried to teach the author's works in the classroom. In the course of her extremely convincing reading of Platonov, Meerson raises some fascinating questions only to dismiss them a bit too quickly. She argues that Platonov is not a satirist because "neostranenie . .. s ... satiroi prosto nesovmestimo, tak kak pri neostra- nenii ob"ekt smekha ne mozhet byt' vnepolozhen chitateliu" (26). Her definition of satire therefore excludes Nikolai Gogol"s Inspector General precisely because the object of laugh- ter is the audience itself. One hopes that the author will treat the ramifications of such a contrast between satire and neostranenie in a separate work. Meerson also raises hopes early on that she will discuss the connection between Platonov's neostranenie, which can- not be understood without taking into account the role of the reader, and Reader Re- sponse theory, but she never follows through on the comparison. Yet given the similarity between Meerson's analysis and such classics of Reader Response as Stanley Fish's approach to Paradise Lost (Surprised by Sin, 1967), Meerson seems to have missed (or at least post- poned) the opportunity to develop neostranenie as a broader critical tool whose applica- bility goes far beyond Platonov's work alone. Nonetheless, as an analysis of the stylistics and philosophy of Andrei Platonov, "Svobodnaia vesch"' more than lives up to its promise. ELIOT BORENSTEIN New York University</page></plain_text>
