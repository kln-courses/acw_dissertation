<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 56, NUMBER 2 (1980) M finds that Japanese attitudes are des- cribable quite exactly in terms of the charac- teristics of mysticism identified by William James in The varieties of religious experience. One surprising consequence is that, although a Caucasian who speaks a LITTLE Japanese is praised extravagantly, one who speaks the language fluently is apt to be treated with feigned incomprehension, as an invader of 'sociolinguistic territorial integrity' (82). M concludes that, since 'the Japanese approach their language within a mystical framework of beliefs about its structure and operation' (91), the foreigner must exercise unusual caution with regard to Japanese linguistic behavior; in particular, both the translator and the user of translations must be highly aware of the full sociolinguistic context. [WILLIAM BRIGHT, UCLA.] Mass terms: Some philosophical prob- lems. Ed. by FRANCIS J. PELLETIER. (Synthese language library, 6.) Dor- drecht: Reidel, 1979. Pp. xiii, 303. f80.00. A professor of linguistics once said to me that philosophers cannot teach linguists any- thing about language-regrettable chauvinism. Since Aristotle, and especially during the last decade, it has been impossible for any lin- guist worth his salt, if he professed an interest in syntax and semantics, to ignore develop- ments in the philosophy of language. Reidel's 'Synthese library series' provides useful hand- books for the purpose, and this volume is as good as any in the series; it will be of value to anyone interested in countability. It is a collection of nineteen papers on mass terms: all but three were originally published in philosophical journals, from 1970 on; ten of them appeared in Synthese 31 (1975). The new papers are by Sharvy, Pelletier, and Bunt (whose contribution is an extended version of his 'Formal semantics of mass terms', Papers from the 3rd Scandinavian Conference on Linguistics, ed. by F. Karlsson, 1976). There is an introductory survey of the field by Pelletier, who has also compiled a bibliography of 65 recent works on mass terms-including all the articles in this book and a number of US dissertations, but nothing from Europe (e.g. Bunt's 1976 paper is unlisted). The contents are grouped under three major topics: the linguistics of mass terms, the ontology of mass terms, and the logic of mass terms. The range stretches from the Quinean view that non-sortals are constituted of sortal parts to the antithetical notion that all sortals are instances of non-sortals, and from Parson's predicate logic to Montague's intensional logic and to Bunt's ensemble theory-which is remarkably similar to a set theory that uses the notion of an ensemble (corresponding to a mass term) in place of a set. So a wide variety of views and analytical procedures are presented in the book. There are indices of names and subjects, too rare in such collections. I noted an insignifi- cant typo on p. 8, line 5; and Gabbay and Moravcsik's names are re-ordered in the bibliography. Any other typographical in- felicities escaped me. I have two final comments, not about the book itself. By and large, the philosophy of mass terms takes for granted the traditional assignment of couniaoility to nouns, although the evidence clearly indicates that countability is a subcategory of NP's; congratulations should go to Bunt and to Pelletier for recogni- zing this. Finally, I suspect the assumed primacy of count terms, by a number of eminent philosophers, to be a consequence of the obligatory marking of countability in IE languages. Had these same people spoken, say, an Oriental language in which sortals are identified optionally and then periphrastically, would they have made the same assumption ?

This new collection of nineteen articles, all previously published (with one exception) during the period 1976-79 (again, with one exception), constitutes further evidence of S's prodigious production in the 'field' of semiotics. In accordance with its title, the book is divided into two main parts (followed by appendices comprising three miscellaneous pieces). Part I ('The sign') consists of eight papers (two co-authored), meant to exemplify S's 'absolute conviction that semiotics begins and ends with biology, and that the sign science and the life science ineluctably imply each other' (viii). While there is frequent reference to Charles Sanders Peirce, and a 476</page><page sequence="2">BOOK NOTICES judicious selection of quotations (mostly) from Peirce's Collected papers, it is clear that S's real heroes are the 'Baltic Baron' biologist Jacob von Uexkiill (1864-1944) and the French mathematician Rend Thom (b. 1923)- particularly the latter, whom S considers a modern-day successor to Peirce. The first half of the book is rich in material para- phrasing and drawing upon a vast bibliog- raphy of items in various subfields of biology, with a particular focus on the relationship between animal communication (' zoosemiotic systems') in general and human communication ('anthropomorphic systems') specifically. These essays all comport well with S's over-all research outlook, which seeks to widen the scope of what he insists on calling a field to include 'the whole of oikoumene, the entirety of our planetary biosphere' (63). The sheer number of names and works marshaled in support of this ambitious program is truly mind-boggling. (There are, however, three significant omissions: the linguists Henning Andersen and Raimo Anttila, and the ornithologist Luis Baptista.) Part II ('The masters') is a series of eight essays, all but one of which (on the connection between Peirce and Saussure) are calculated to memorialize scholars who have contributed to the 'science of signs' in greater or lesser degree and with whom S feels a particular affinity: Uexkiill, Gyula Laziczius, Roman Jakobson, John Lotz, and Joseph Greenberg. In the case of the latter three linguists (with one of whom S shares a Hungarian back- ground), the account relies on personal acquaintance of long standing. S motivates his singling out of men whose impact on inquiry into semiosis is hardly commensurable by (once again) widening the compass of the word 'masters', in a double meaning to embrace 'any agent that utters and any patient that interprets [a sign], any organism, be it man, woman, child, speechless creature ... in short, you or me' (xiii). One of the distinctive features of S's approach to his subject is an eschewal of critical controversy. The 'ecumenicalism' which he advocates (61-83) is evidently incompatible with partis pris. Nevertheless, he occasionally allows some sort of value judgment, albeit in attenuated form, e.g. when obliquely taking issue with Eco's utterly misguided attempt at 'debunking' Peirce's notion of icon (115)-or when assessing (though quite erroneously) Jakobson's grounds in taking sides in a dispute between two former students (227). The book is splendidly produced, and has the welcome feature of being supplied with many photographs and illustrations. [MICHAEL SHAPIRO, UCLA.] Language and style. By E. L. EPSTEIN. London: Methuen, 1978. Pp. xii, 92. Cloth $12.50, paper $5.95. Epstein's short work offers a concise discussion of a number of topics contained within the vast realm of literary 'style'. Chap. I is dominated by the question of the perception of personal style; here E presents a schema (6-7) whereby each apperceptive level of style 'acts as the identificative dimension of the succeeding level', enabling the perceiver to perform increasingly refined detective work and attribution. Chap. II, 'Types of linguistic criticism', relies on speech-act theory to help determine the characterization of styles through such features as 'rhetorical' questions. Chaps. III-IV grapple with the central thesis of the book, which is an attempt to demarcate public and private stylistic elements, often resulting in a conflation of privateness and uniqueness (which I would roughly define as a single instance of the 'public' elements). This commitment to the impossible task of clearly segregating shared, public patterns of articulation from intonation, phonology, and syntax leads E to assert, for example, the 'comparative lack of intonational structures in the acoustic texture of casual conversation' (40) as compared with those in poetry. (This statement is puzzling in view of the depend- ence of the casual utterance, such as Mm-hmm, upon intonation for almost its entire signific- ance.) According, to E, such features as transition difficulties, excesses of information words with a concomitant increase in major stresses, 'emergency' phonology (41), and a paralinguistic slowing of tempo explain the obstructed style of performance of difficult poetry (including that of silent reading). Insofar as the distinction between form and content can be clear at all, it does not actually coincide with, but cuts across, the distinction between what is style and what is not. Style would then comprise characteristic features both of what is said and of how it is said. If it 477</page></plain_text>
