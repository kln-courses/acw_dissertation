<plain_text><page sequence="1">ATHENIAN LITERACY IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C. BY ALFRED BURNS The question of the quantitative prevalence and qualitative level of Athenian literacy in the earlier part of the fifth century B.C. has been the subject of a lively debate during the last two decades.1 I shall attempt to show that from the end of the sixth century B.C. the vast majority of Athenian citizens were literate and that literacy, though not universal, played an important role in Athens' intellectual and cultural development by affecting thought processes in certain specific ways. The conceptual changes, beginning in the sixth century B.C. and maturing in the fifth, produced classical drama, art and architecture, democracy, the kind of self-image presented by Thucydides in Peri- cles' funeral oration, and a language capable of sustaining a high level of philosophic inquiry and scientific thought. Various book titles have indicated this development, e.g., From Religion to Philosophy,2 From Mythos to Logos,3 The Discovery of the Mind,4 etc. Such 1 I am much indebted to the works of the following authors who have more recently expressed opinions on the subject, and on whose compilations of ancient sources I have relied heavily. E. G. Turner, Athenian Books in the Fifth and Fourth Centuries B.C. (London, 1951), is the strongest advocate of fifth-century Athenian literacy. F. D. Harvey, "Literacy in the Athenian Democracy," Revue des Etudes Grecques, 79 (1966), 585-635, arguing for general literacy, presents the most systema- tic and complete review of the ancient testimonies. J. A. Davison, "Literature and Literacy in Ancient Greece," Phoenix, 16 (1962), 141-56 and 219-32, raised serious doubts about the extent and quality of literacy in the fifth century. E. A. Havelock, Preface to Plato (Harvard, 1963); "Pre-Literacy and the Pre-Socratics," Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies, 13, (1966), 45-55; Prologue to Greek Literacy (Cincinnati, 1971); The Greek Concept of Justice (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), in all his works is the most vigorous proponent of the case against Athenian literacy in the first three quarters of the fifth century. R. Pfeiffer, History of Classical Scholarship (Oxford, 1968), treating the subject incidentally, takes a middle ground suggesting a continuous progress of literacy throughout the fifth century; he presents significant references to ancient sources. L. Woodbury, "Aristophanes' Frogs and Athenian Literacy: Ran. 52-53, 1114," Transactions of the American Philological Association, 106 (1976), 349-57, presents a thorough study of references in Aristophanes. 2 F.

In spite of many insights into the achievements of older civilizations from which the Greeks learned much, most scholars were forced to return to the traditional view that the develop- ment of the methods and language of abstract thought was an original Greek ac- complishment, occurring nowhere else except through derivation from the Greek 371</page><page sequence="2">372 ALFRED BURNS labels have come under attack for various reasons, but it would serve no purpose to prefer one or to create yet a new one. There is, how- ever, general agreement that a unique intellectual advance occurred, though different reasons have been offered to explain why it hap- pened in that particular place at that particular time. For generations the "Greek miracle" had been accepted simply as a manifestation of a special Hellenic genius or racial endowment.5 Among more attrac- tive and more plausible explanations, various political, economic, and cultural factors have been suggested and undoubtedly played a part, but the primary catalyst, as E. A. Havelock proposed, seems to have been the first appearance in the world of widespread literacy and its interaction with a highly developed oral culture.6 Following Di- ringer and Gelb,7 he pointed out that the Greek adaptation of the Semitic alphabet was so superior to all previous writing systems that it made the democratization of literacy possible. Earlier ideographic and syllabic scripts, consisting of hundreds of signs, had been so complex and ambiguous that their mastery required many years of schooling and remained the monopoly of professional scribes who jealously guarded their privileged position within monarchical em- pires.8 Even the West-Semitic ancestor of the Greek alphabet and its Aramaic and Hebrew derivatives, because of the absence of a diacrit- ical notation for vowels, remained ambiguous and difficult to read, and the professional scribe is still much in evidence in the Gospels. The fully vocalized Greek alphabet for the first time allowed an essen- tially accurate portrayal of human speech by means of less than thirty signs. Reading and writing could now be learned in a relatively short time, even by children. The absence of a central monarchic or hieratic vested interest in literacy made a rapid dissemination of the art of writing possible.9 Goody and Watt have shown the impact of literacy on traditional "oral" thought processes.10 models as Snell points out (77); but cf. also: 0.

I maintain that this paradox is due to his underestimation of the extent of fifth-century literacy and an overly demanding definition of literacy as that state of proficiency in which reading learned in childhood through practice and habit has become an automatic activity requiring almost no conscious effort." Since this ability presupposes systematic schooling in childhood and the abundant availability of books, he believes, it could not have existed much earlier than the fourth century B.C.12 He classifies the situation during the fifth century as "craft literacy" confined to poets, dramatists, and a few other professions,13 discounting the literacy of the rest of the population as rudimentary at best or non-existent.14 He considers Plato's polemic against poetry in the Republic conclusive evidence that "the cultural situation described by Plato is one in which oral communication still dominates all the important relation- ships and valid transactions in life." 15 He concedes: Are there not a wealth of inscriptions? What of the public decrees inscribed and put up in Athens in the fifth century? What of the references to the use of documents in Old Comedy? Did not the reform, fairly recent when he wrote, which converted the Attic alphabet to the Ionic model presuppose a wide- spread use of documentation? As to the educational curriculum, does not Plato himself in the Protagoras, written presumably earlier than the Repub- lic, supply the locus classicus which attests to the teaching of letters in school? These are a sample of the objections which could be cited against the conclusion that Greek culture at the turn of the century was still essentially oral.16 Nevertheless, he ends: "Yet the weight of Plato's testimony is there, impossible to shake off ..." This statement fails to give sufficient weight to the objections it concedes. Since the appearance of the Preface to Plato and its sequels in which Havelock pushes his theory even further,17 the book has been reviewed repeatedly.

(2) The critics almost unanimously reject the assertions on which his thesis is based: that the Athenians were by and large illiterate and lived in an oral society almost down to Plato's time; that all Greek poetry was essentially didactic, the Homeric poems essentially an "encyclopedia" of prac- tical knowledge even governing political procedures; that the polemic against the poets in Plato's Republic, on which much of Havelock's argument is based, is not so much a conflict of philosophies as a conflict between the concrete affective language of the oral tradition which he identifies with Plato's "opinion" (doxa) and the objective "scientific" language of literate prose which Plato is just in the proc- ess of creating. Although the reviewers rightfully take issue with these premises, they fail to give due consideration to the central question, namely, the part that widespread literacy may have played in the transition from mythical to logical thought. Since that transition took place essen- tially during the fifth century, although it must have begun earlier and never came to an end, it seems appropriate to re-examine the evi- dence for literacy and some of its possible effects on the intellectual life during that period. The diffusion of the art of writing throughout the Greek-speaking world apparently proceeded quite rapidly after the acquisition of the alphabet. The Homeric poems were put into writing and the works of Hesiod were written probably at least as early as the seventh century. The oldest Greek law-code at Dreros dates to the seventh century.19 Inscribed law-codes in eight other cities of Crete, in Athens, and in Corinth during the late seventh or early sixth century followed. In- scriptions on all kinds of objects proliferated during the sixth century: epitaphs, dedicatory inscriptions on votive gifts, identifying labels on vase-paintings, graffiti,20 etc. The wealth of epigraphic material im- plies not only the literacy of the author or donor but also the expecta- tion that many viewers will be able to read. Lyric poetry flourished during the sixth century, and the more intimate kind such as Sappho's cannot have been meant for public recital and yet was preserved. Herodotus (5.59) mentions the use of leather as writing material in Ionia in the old times when papyrus was scarce, and Jeffery suspects from the early Ionic letter-forms that a cursive script may have been in use.21 There are, however, no literary sources or other adequate 19 Jeffery, The Local Scripts, 311. 20 Ibid., 61-63. 21 Ibid., 57</page><page sequence="5">ATHENIAN LITERACY IN FIFTH CENTURY B.C. 375 evidence to determine the extent or degree of literacy among the general population during the sixth century. A convincing case for widespread literacy from the beginning of the fifth century onward has been presented by a number of schol- ars,22 though the items of evidence are admittedly scarce and some- times ambiguous. Since none of the literary sources are directly con- cerned with the question of literacy, conclusions must be drawn from chance remarks by the historians, the implications of various state- ments in drama, inferences from certain political procedures such as ostracism, and the indirect evidence of vase-paintings and inscrip- tions. As is to be expected, the evidence for literacy increases to- wards and into the fourth century. The fundamental question that arises is how far back into the past we can project conditions attested for a later time. Since the advocates on both sides of the argument cite the same limited body of evidence23 and disagree mainly on the interpretation of some of the source material, I will confine myself to discussing those items which have given rise to the most divergent views. I shall try to refrain as much as possible from using late evi- dence from the early fourth or even the late fifth century. 1. Schools-The literary references to the earliest schools point to the first decade of the fifth century. Herodotus (6.27.2) tells us that 119 children were killed "while learning their letters" by the collapse of a schoolroof in Chios in 496. In 492 a boxer in an attack of insanity killed 60 children in a school in Astypalaia (Pausanias 6.96).24 Be- sides, although we probably cannot trust Pausanias' report (6.15.6) that Tyrtaeus was an Athenian schoolmaster, we do know that Sap- pho operated a sort of girls' finishing school and that it would have been strange had no male counterparts existed. The objection has been raised that the mere existence of schools does not prove that reading and writing were taught. Aristophanes mentions only the gymnastics teacher (paidotribes) and the music teacher (kitharistes)25; the grammatistes is not mentioned until the fourth century. The question seems decided, however, by the vase- paintings. As Immerwahr has pointed out, the first appearance of school-scenes on Attic vases coincides with the period indicated in literary references of later date.26 The compilations of vase-paintings presented by Birt, Immerwahr, and more recently by Beck and Webs- 22 E.g., Turner, Harvey, Pfeiffer (note 1); H. R. Immerwahr, "Book Rolls on Attic Vases," Classical and Renaissance Studies in Honor of B. L. Ullman (Rome, 1964), 17-48; E. Vanderpool, Ostracism in Athens (Cincinnati, 1970), 15. 23 Woodbury (note 1), 353-54, presents a summary. 24 Cf. H. I. Marrou, Histoire de l'ducation dans l'antiquite (Paris, 1948), 482 note 7; Immerwahr, 17 note 3; Harvey, 630. 25 Marrou, 74-77: Jeffery, 63. 26 Immerwahr, 17.</page><page sequence="6">376 ALFRED BURNS ter,27 show many school-scenes in which bookrolls and writing- tablets are associated with lyre and flute playing and with poetry recital. Webster observes in his study of vase-paintings that there are three objects which suggest a school-scene: "writing apparatus, lyres, flutes."28 These pictures are clear evidence that reading and writing were an integral part of music instruction, i.e., the teaching of mousike in the wider Greek sense which includes all forms of music, poetry, and the other domains of the Muses. That letters were part of music is confirmed by Aristophanes whose sausage-seller says: "I don't even know music except my letters . . ." (Knights, 188-90). Even if in the early fifth century specialization had not yet reached the point at which writing became the separate subject of the grammatistes, it was part of the music curriculum. The literary evi- dence thus confirms the testimony of the vase-paintings that reading and writing were taught in the early fifth-century schools, a date confirmed also by Plato's reference in the Protagoras (325d-e).29 2. Drama-The transition from an oral to a literate way of thought is vividly illustrated by several passages in the dramatists. Davison has noted that in epic poetry the invocations of the Muses before intricate passages (such as catalogues) seem to have been signals that the poet was about to quote an existing fixed poetic text. The poem was the Muse, the daughter of Remembrance.30 But in Aeschylus' Prometheus (460), the "combinations of letters" (grammaton syntheseis) have become "remembrance of all things, the mother of the Muses"; subsequently, Prometheus exhorts Io to inscribe his prophecy on the "tablets of her mind" (788). In the Eumenides (273), Hades observes everything with his "note-taking mind" (deltographo phreni). This image of the mental notebook ap- pears also in Sophocles (Phil. 1325) and in Euripides (frag. 506 N.2).31 The written tablet has taken the place of Remembrance as the mother of the Muses and has become the repository of knowledge. Furthermore, the use of writing in daily life is taken for granted by the dramatists. In the Hippolytus, Phaedra writes her suicide note and Theseus reads it as a matter of course. In the Palamedes Euripides calls the letters the medicine against forgetting (lethes pharmaka) and stresses their practical uses: "that one not present across the expanse of the sea may know well at home all things over there, that a man dying may write the measure of his possessions and tell his children, and he who receives may know. The evils that befall men in quarrel 27 T. Birt, Die Buchrolle in der Kunst (Leipzig, 1907); F. A. G. Beck, Album of Greek Education (Sidney, 1975); T. B. L.

This passage shows that the mechanics of society is no longer predominantly oral. However, Harvey, overly cautious, concludes that ". . . this tells us very little since not only could a will be dictated, but the only men likely to make a will would be those who were at least moderately well off and we would expect them to be literate."33 We have here a twofold argument: (1) a will can be dictated; (2) by implication it would con- cern only a few who are well off. Most people today have their wills prepared by lawyers. Can we draw from this fact the inference that our society is not literate? No matter who prepares the document, a society in which written documents regulate social, legal, and com- mercial relationships must be called a literate society. Letters, wills, and contractual agreements typify these three kinds of relationships, and that is exactly why Euripides chose them as examples. In some societies with very restricted literacy, the average person normally has recourse to a professional scribe for preparation of such docu- ments. As far as we know there were no professional scribes in Greece. How many people in Athens would have been sufficiently "well off" to be interested in making a will? We can assume that most Athenian citizens owned the houses they lived in; many owned farms; some were tradesmen producing various kinds of goods; a certain number of them owned slaves. It would seem that, especially before the Peloponnesian war, the people in all these categories would have been a majority of the citizens with sufficient property to be "at least moderately well off" and thus, if we follow Harvey's argument to the end, interested in a will and presumably literate. I believe Euripides' passage is a good indication of the function of literacy in Athenian daily life. In political life, too, the stress on written documentation is evident in the tragedies. The dramatists practically identify written laws and decrees with democratic government (Aesch. Suppl., 942-49; Eur. Suppl., 429-35).34 Furthermore, as Harvey and Turner have pointed out, the dramatists reflect their expectation that the Athenian audi- ence will be literate: Athenaeus (454 B-E) preserves similar scenes in plays by three dramatists, Euripides, Agathon, and Theodectes, in which an illiterate spells out the name of Theseus by describing the shape of each letter as it appears written on a ship. The fact that the scene was used three different times indicates its dramatic effective- ness. It could not have made any impact on the spectators unless they knew how to read.35 It seems to me that the inferences that can be 32 I translated the passage literally, though awkwardly. 33 Harvey, 617. 34 Ibid., 598; Turner, 9. 35 Turner, ibid.; Harvey, 604.</page><page sequence="8">378 ALFRED BURNS drawn from the tragedies strongly suggest an intellectual climate of widespread literacy. 3. Prose Literature-It has been repeatedly asserted that no books in prose existed before Herodotus' Histories.36 The writings of the Milesians, if any existed at all, could only be classified as memoranda, notes to themselves. Yet, there is convincing evidence for the existence of books by Pherecydes of Syros, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Hecataeus. The Greek tradition preserved the title of Pherecydes' book, The Seven Recesses (heptamychos), and claimed that it was the first book of prose. Diogenes Laertius in the third century A.D. stated that the book still survived, and he quoted the beginning words.37 An extensive quotation has been identified on a papyrus from the third century A.D.38 At least one passage of Anax- imander's book reached Theophrastus, whose report is quoted by the later doxographers39 in three almost identical versions with Theo- phrastus' comment on Anaximander's "all too poetic" mode of ex- pression. About Anaximenes, on the other hand, we are told by Diogenes, quoting from the same source, that he wrote "in simple uncontrived Ionic speech," a clear indication that Theophrastus must have known Anaximenes' book.40 Both Anaximander and Hecataeus were credited with having drawn the first maps of the world. Accord- ing to Strabo, Eratosthenes identified a map, presumably in the Alexandrian library, as the one by Hecataeus "on the basis of his [sc. Hecataeus'] other writings."41 Heraclitus' sayings were so widely quoted that they must have been circulated in written form. Thus, there cannot be any doubt that prose writings of the early Ionian thinkers existed for several centuries. They must have had at least limited circulation some time around the middle of the fifth century B.C. as Herodotus saw the maps (4.36) and many echos of their writings can be discerned in drama. Even more conclusive is the evidence for the existence of an extensive prose literature by the early historians who, following in the footsteps of Hecataeus, wrote more or less critically about the legen- dary past. They are commonly referred to by modem historians as the logographers. Kurt von Fritz has convincingly shown that the term as originally used in antiquity, e.g., by Thucydides (1.21) and by Aris- totle (Rhet. 2.7. 1388b21-22) meant specifically "prose-writers" and was coined to distinguish them from the poets who treated the 36 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Einleitung in die Griechische Tragidie (Ber- lin, 1889), 121-23; Havelock (1971), 59. 37 G.

The first, or older, group is comprised of nine writers who seem to fall into the late sixth and the first half of the fifth century; the second group is more or less contemporary with Herodotus and Thucydides.43 The older group includes Hecataeus and several others whose existence is confirmed by other ancient sources and numerous fragments. The following are the best attested ones: Acousilaos of Argos, also mentioned by Josephus, seems to have been contemporary with Hecataeus44; a long papyrus fragment of his work survives. Pherecydes of Athens is dated to the first half of the fifth century; many fragments of his work survive.45 Democles of Phygela (or Pygela), mentioned also by Strabo (who quotes Demetrius of Skepsis), related historical events to earthquakes and other natural events.46 Ion of Chios (ca. 483 to 423) wrote a local history of Chios of which Pausanias gives an ab- breviated content.47 From these few examples it should be clear that a considerable amount of prose literature existed during the fifth century. The objection has been raised, however, that since there is no evidence of a booktrade before the very end of the fifth century, no means of distribution existed and consequently no readership. This argument also seems an over-statement. Even a few copies can be circulated widely among relatives, friends, and acquaintances. They can be read aloud before groups, and people can make their own copies. Pindar states at the beginning of his fifth Nemean ode that his poem will go out on every ship, thus implying that numerous copies were written. Plato's Socrates (Phaedo 97b-98b), after hearing about Anaxagoras' book from someone who had read it, apparently ob- tained a copy without difficulty. We will disregard his statement in the Apology (26d-e) that everybody knew the book which could be bought for one Drachme because that statement belongs to a later period and might have been ironical. That books circulated and were read in the earlier part of the fifth century, at least one other example will show. Aristotle (Pol. 1267b22-68a14) gives us a summary of the theories of Hippodamus of Miletus (not much later than Hecataeus), the city planner who rebuilt the town at the Piraeus after the Persian destruction. Aristotle's account (in his Politics) is of the utmost inter- est to us as it sheds light on many aspects of our subject, as follows: 42 K. von Fritz, Die Griechische Geschichtschreibung (Berlin, 1967), I Anmer- kungen, 338-41. 43 Ibid., I Text, 77; F.

(3) According to Aristotle, Hippodamus' work is the first theoret- ical attempt to construct an ideal state (politeia). Hippodamus deals with all aspects of the community: physical, political, social, and judicial.49 Thus, he precedes Plato's Republic by almost a hundred years in this kind of abstract speculation which is supposed not yet to have existed in the earlier "semi-literate" period. (4) Hippodamus, like other authors mentioned in the foregoing, was a Milesian. His work seems to confirm the evidence that the writing of prose disquisition was a common practice in Miletus, a city with which Athens always maintained close relations. That his and similar treatises circulated widely in Athens seems confirmed by Aristophanes in the Birds (992-1010) where he parodies city planners and theoretical planning concepts. (5) But most important for us are Hippodamus' proposed judicial procedures which clearly presuppose general literacy: "Verdicts in law-courts he thought ought to be given not by voting simply for or against, but each member of the court was to have a tablet, on which he was to state in writing the penalty or damages, if it was a simple verdict of condemnation, and leave blank if a plain acquittal; and if it was neither one nor the other, he was to state this opinion on the tablet" (Aristotle, Pol. 1268al-5). Literacy of elected judges is thus tacitly assumed by Hippodamus. So far we have tried to draw inferences on the status of literacy mainly from the scanty earlier fifth-century sources. We have on purpose omitted most references in Aristophanes' comedies, not only because they have been repeatedly quoted in this context but also because they pertain rather to the last quarter of the century for which a wider spread of literacy has been generally conceded.50 L. 48 P. Foucart, "Constructions de Th6mistocle au Pire6 et h Salamine," Journal des savants, 5 (1907), 177-86, and R. Martin, L'urbanisme dans la Grece antique (Paris, 1956), 104, place the work of Hippodamus at the Piraeus under Themistocles in the seventies. E. Fabricius, "Hippodamos," RE, vol. 8-2, col. 1732, 47, and A. von Gerkan, Griechische Stadteanlagen (Leipzig, 1924), 47, favor a date in the sixties. R. E. Wycherley, "Hippodamus and Rhodes," Historia, 13 (1964), 139, proposes a date "perhaps towards 460." A. Burs, "Hippodamus and the Planned City," Historia, 24 (1976), 427, suggests the fifties. Thus, Hippodamus' book, which presumably provided his credentials as a planner and thus led to his commission at the Piraeus, must have been written well before 450 B.C. 49 Bus, ibid., 420-21. 50 Davison, 156, 219; Havelock (1963), 40; (1971), 60; Pfeiffer, 29-30; Woodbury, 354.</page><page sequence="11">ATHENIAN LITERACY IN FIFTH CENTURY B.C. 381 Woodbury after a thorough study of the pertinent passages in Aris- tophanes, and especially in the Frogs, concludes: The Athenian crowd must have agreed with him in setting little store by the intellectuals' new fondness for reading many books. In the same way, Dionysus' practice of reading at sea is probably meant to seem ridiculous in Athenian eyes rather than typical of their own habits. The earlier passage shows that it was possible to obtain a book containing a popular Euripidean tragedy, but both oppose rather than support the view that such books were in common use. On the positive side, it is implied that a minimal literacy consisting in the ability to read and write, as taught by the grammatistes, was common, though apparently recent. The Athenian citizen knew his letters and thought himself well able to judge both the traditional poets and the new intellectual class. Doubtless he read little literature, but he had no reason to regard reading as a recondite skill or readers as an alien elite from which he found himself altogether excluded.5' Those who argue that the situation which emerges from Aris- tophanes cannot be projected back into the earlier part of the century rely mainly on the argumentum ex silentio. But is there not a similar argument from silence to be derived from the later writers? In spite of their strong antiquarian and historical interests, neither Herodotus nor Thucydides, Plato, or Aristotle, who all expected to reach a literate audience, ever mention any turning-point in their recent history when reading and writing became common among the people. Herodotus takes it for granted that the Greeks have been literate ever since the Ionians acquired the alphabet from the Phoenicians when papyrus was still scarce and skins were the common writing-material (5.58). But no argument from silence can carry any weight as evidence. All that can be said is that limiting ourselves to the early sources, the tragedians, Hippodamus' treatise as reported by Aristotle, inscrip- tions and vase-paintings, we have found no evidence against literacy and many indications of the prevalence of literacy. Although none of the literary testimonies we have cited can be considered "proof' of general literacy, the cumulative weight of the evidence indicates that the mechanics of fifth-century Athenian society was no longer pre- dominantly oral. This seems true of the political life also. 4. Political Institutions and Procedures-The opinion has been repeatedly expressed that the very fact of the institution of ostracism presupposes literacy of the Athenian voters at the end of the sixth century.52 Against this view several objections have been raised. Plutarch (Aristides 7.7-8) tells the following anecdote: an illiterate who did not know Aristides approached him during the ostracism and 51 Woodbury, 357. 52 Marrou, 77; Jeffery, 63; Vanderpool, 13-15.</page><page sequence="12">382 ALFRED BURNS asked him to write the name of Aristides on his ostracon; Aristides complied with the request. This dubious story has been construed not only to confirm the prevalence of illiteracy among the Athenians but also to refute the view that ostracism was based on the assumption of general literacy since any illiterate could have his ostracon marked by someone else.53 If we knew that this anecdote came from a contem- porary source, we could draw the opposite conclusion, viz., that it confirms general literacy: the illiterate apparently assumed that al- most everybody knew how to write since he approached a perfect stranger to inscribe the ostracon for him. But as we do not know the source, or the date of the origin of the story which might be quite late, the anecdote provides no evidence on either side of the question.54 The evidence of the many hundreds of ostraca that have been found has been interpreted to show a low level of literacy. Primitive handwriting, erratic spelling, and the use of "prefabricated" ostraca are cited as evidence.55 E. Vanderpool, who has undertaken a most thorough study of the ostraca,56 takes a different view: the difficulty of writing on an intractable material with an improvised tool explains poor writing and the use of ready-made ostraca as a matter of conven- ience. Such ostraca, e.g., the famous 190 Themistocles-ostraca writ- ten by only fourteen different hands may also have been a means of electioneering. The variety of modes of writing, including retrograde, from the bottom up, and even boustrophedon, the use of Attic, Ionic, and many antiquated letterforms, and mixtures of all of these, indicate a wide dissemination of literacy among different areas, classes, and age-groups among the population. Similarly, the "erratic spelling," in the absence of any standardization, reflects different linguistic usages and different stages in the writing-conventions, e.g., contracted forms side by side with the uncontracted, presence and absence of aspira- tion, or the linguistically common transfer of the aspiration within the same word, masculine genitive endings indicated by omicron, omega, and rarely by the false diphthong omicron-upsilon. All this and the great quantity of "home-made" ostraca, some with added remarks, point to a widespread literacy rather than a poor level.57 Vanderpool concludes that the legislator knew the citizen was able, in the words 53 Havelock (1963), 54 note 10; Harvey, 592-93. 54 The story sounds like an apocryphal tale by a later writer. For Plutarch's sources see: Uxcull-Gyllenband, Plutarch und die griechische Biographie (Stuttgart, 1927); N. Barbu, Les procedes de la peinture des caracteres et la verite historique dans les biographies de Plutarque (Paris, 1934); G. Leander, Plutarch und die Geschichte (Lund, 1951). 55 Havelock (1963), 54 note 10. 56 Vanderpool, 13-15. 57 Ibid.</page><page sequence="13">ATHENIAN LITERACY IN FIFTH CENTURY B.C. 383 of Plutarch (Aristides 7.5), "to take an ostracon and write on it the name of the person he thought should be banished." Furthermore, many boundary-stones have been found at the Piraeus (connected with Hippodamus' layout of the new town) which show the same mixture of letterforms and spellings as the ostraca. There is one example where the letter H is used twice on the same stone, at the beginning of a word to indicate the aspiration and in the middle to represent the long E.58 This shows how much the writing and spelling conventions were in flux prior to the final adaptation of the Ionian system. Secondly, Cleisthenes instituted ostracism to gain favor with the mass of the people (tou plethous) according to Aristotle (Athena- ion Politeia, 22), thus adding credibility to Vanderpool's view that the legislator knew that the great majority were literate, since the law of ostracism was designed for their benefit rather than for the aristocra- tic elite. We find the same evidence of general literacy in most of the other political procedures from Cleisthenes' democratic reforms onward. Laws and decrees are engraved on stone and publicly displayed, apparently at great expense, while proceedings of decision-making bodies are recorded by secretaries. Some arguments like those used to discount ostracism as evidence for general literacy are used also in this context: the inscribed laws might have served only as references for officials,59 or they could always have been read by the literate few to the others. The secretaries might have been chosen (by either vote or lot) only from those able to write.60 From this line of reasoning one would almost infer that the part of the citizens who knew how to read and write spent some of their time reading and writing for those who were illiterate. Athenians seem to have had much more confidence in the literacy of their fellow citizens. As Meritt and Harvey point out, the phrase skopein to boulomeno, common in fifth-century inscrip- tions, expresses this confidence: the order for public display, "so anyone who might wish could see," is usually included in the de- cree.61 In addition to laws and important decrees passed by the boule or the assembly and inscribed in stone, there are numerous minor commissions, committees, and magistratures, all involving what we would call today paperwork: preparation and review of accounts, analysis and approval of proposals, drawing up and surveillance of specifications for public buildings,62 maintenance of membership lists 58 D.

All this presupposes at least a minimal level of literacy among a great number of people, and it is hard to see how such a system could have worked without it. Thus, the inferences to be drawn from the workings of the political institutions seem to con- firm the indications for widespread literacy which we have found in literature. This brings us to the crucial question: How far is Athenian literacy from "full literacy"'? The answer depends on the definition of full literacy. Generally, most of the European countries, the members of the British commonwealth, the United States, and Japan are consid- ered fully literate. At the same time nobody would deny that in all these countries residues of illiterates exist and that even larger per- centages of the population would fall short of the standard of effort- less, nearly automatic reading and writing ability. The U.S. Navy, for example, routinely rejects about thirty percent of its would-be re- cruits because of "functional illiteracy," i.e., the inability to function effectively in a given literate society. In the American environment functional literacy has usually been defined as the ability to read newspapers, to fill out employment applications, and to follow writ- ten instructions (e.g., Navy manuals). Thus, even in a modem "fully literate" society, a wide range of different levels of literacy is to be found among the population although the vast majority of the popula- tion is expected to be at least functionally literate. Obviously, a different standard must be applied to an ancient society. (Even the term "population" needs qualification: in the Athenian context it can include only the free-born male citizens.) The level of literacy which would constitute functional literacy can only be a matter of conjecture. We must try to determine as nearly as possible the most important functions the average fifth-century Athe- nian had to perform. Perhaps, if we could have asked him, he would have said that his function as a citizen of Athens was the most impor- tant. Many reflections of this attitude are implicit in such literary works as the Eumenides, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus, Pericles' Funeral Oration, the Apology, etc. The derogatory connotations of the word idiotes are also highly indicative. The success of the Sophists in attracting pupils was based mainly on their promise to teach effectiveness in political life. Aristo- tle had especially the Greeks in mind when he coined the phrase a hundred years later that man is a zoon politikon. If we consider the</page><page sequence="15">ATHENIAN LITERACY IN FIFTH CENTURY B.C. 385 importance given to political participation and the fact that literacy was a prerequisite to the exercise of many public functions, we can see that among a people as competitive as the Greeks the psychologi- cal and social pressures to acquire "functional" literacy must have been almost irresistible. It is hard to visualize an ancient Athenian revealing to his fellow citizens that he is illiterate. We do not hear of any illiterates in the history of Athenian politics. The anecdote, told some three hundred years later, about the illiterate who asked Aris- tides to write his own name on the ostracon and the episode of the illiterate in drama who described the letters in Theseus' name show that the illiterate had become the object of humorous stories, the butt of jokes. But he must have been very rare; we cannot even find him in Aristophanes who seizes on all faults and weaknesses among his fellow citizens. On the contrary, it is the "over-educated" who are Aristophanes' favorite target. It would thus seem that the average Athenian was almost forced to become functionally literate because of the demands of his society. In addition, as nobody has denied, there was the truly literate elite group of professional writers, poets, dramatists, and thinkers, and without a doubt a small residue of illit- erates also. Even if Athenian literacy may have fallen short quantitatively of general literacy and qualitatively of full literacy as defined by the standard of a universal and effortless reading habit, it nevertheless seems to have been a crucial moving force in the cultural achieve- ments of the fifth century. Goody and Watt have studied three specific effects of literacy on thought-processes.63 (1) In an oral society, the storyteller or poet, composing the tradi- tional tales anew each time he recites them, subconsciously reflects his own environment and adjusts his material to the taste and the expectations of his audience. In this way oral tradition keeps adapting to changing conditions and current perceptions. But once the material is written down it becomes fixed and loses its ability to change. With the passage of time gaps develop between things as they are told and as they are seen. Discrepancies between the inherited mythical views and contemporary experience shed doubt on the traditional verities. Literacy thus invites critical examination of tradition by freezing it in its tracks. Such criticism manifests itself from the beginning of Greek literacy: Hesiod's comment on lying Muses (Theog., 26-27), Ar- chilochus' (6) contempt of the stricture against losing one's shield in battle, and Anaximander's concept of an unsupported earth held in place by equilibrium are some early examples, followed by Xenophanes' criticism of the Homeric anthropomorphic concept of 63 Goody and Watt, 42-49, 67-68.</page><page sequence="16">386 ALFRED BURNS the gods and their morality, the Sophists' denial of traditional moral values, and Herodotus' criticism of the legendary history as well as Thucydides' attempts to distill historic facts from the mythical tradition. (2) The hearer is no longer face to face with the speaker. The reader cannot ask the writer to clarify his meaning. Therefore, much greater precision in expression is required; the need for definition of terms and more logical exposition makes itself felt. The Sophists were the first to raise the use of language to a much more conscious level and initiated the study of the exact meanings of words (orthoepeia); their exercises in semantics permeate the Platonic dialogues.64 Both Plato and Aristotle stress Socrates' concern with the definition of ethical terms. (3) When skeptical disbelief raises a question and the problem is stated in writing, it can be repeatedly contemplated for a protracted length of time. Many minds separated widely over space and time can be brought to bear on the problem and can offer and discuss alternate answers and solutions. The treatment of problems from different perspectives is prominent even in the Presocratics and throughout Greek philosophy. Perhaps the most outstanding early examples of such dialogue are the positive and negative reactions to Parmenides' denial of the void as non-being and his denial of the possibility of change and motion. Most subsequent thinkers tried to deal specifi- cally with Parmenides' tenets, either confirming or trying to refute them, e.g., Zeno, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus.65 To the above I add three more manifestations of Athenian literacy. (4) The formulation of written law raises concerns from the specific to the general. The writer must anticipate and categorize future cases. The lawgiver must define a class of events (A) and prescribe action (B) which will invariably follow any event which falls into class (A). This is a decided advance towards more abstract thought. Its magnitude becomes clear when we realize that the con- cept of codified law projected from the human to the cosmic sphere led eventually to the concept of "natural law" which marked the beginning of scientific thought. This anthropomorphic transfer is dis- cernible in the terminology even at an early stage. Solon (24) invokes Earth as witness "in the lawcourt (dike) of time." Anaximander applies a similar legal terminology to the balance of nature when he says, ". .. for they [scil. the opposites] pay penalty and restitution (diken kai tisin) to each other according to the assessment of Time" 64 K. von Fritz, Grundprobleme der antiken Wissenschaft, 228; Pfeiffer, 37-41; Marrou, 94. 65 Kirk and Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers, 319; Fritz, 64-82.</page><page sequence="17">ATHENIAN LITERACY IN FIFTH CENTURY B.C. 387 (DK 12A9). Parmenides, too, uses the legal image: ". .. therefore Justice (dike) does not, loosing her bonds, permit coming into being or being destroyed" (DK 8. 13-14). The frequently used terms cosmos (order) and ananke (necessity) imply also the belief in an orderly law-abiding universe.66 (5) While in other civilizations where literacy was restricted to a small professional group (such as the scribal classes of Mesopotamia and Egypt) the intellectual life remained static once it had reached a certain plateau, the wide spread of literacy in Greece gave anyone, interested and capable, access to intellectual pursuits, and thus al- lowed participation by a much larger percentage of the population. Descriptions of other lands and customs widened the horizon of the general population. The speculations of the philosophers stimulated independent and innovative thought. The literary parodies in Aristo- tle's Frogs, the ridicule of proto-scientific theories in the Clouds, and the spoof on city planning in the Birds could not have been ap- preciated by an audience that did not have some acquaintance with the pertinent literature.67 (6) The large and varied body of literature made systematic edu- cation possible and in the competitive climate of Greece almost a social necessity. General education (paideia) became an ideal, the criterion of civilized man from the fourth century on. But this evolu- tion had its beginnings in the literacy of the fifth century.68 Since one of the objections against previous presentations of the case for literacy in the first two thirds of the fifth century was the use of later sources from the end of the century or even from the fourth century,69 we have tried to confine ourselves to arguments drawn from the earlier sources, essentially the tragedians, the early prose- writers such as Hippodamus quoted by Aristotle, vase-paintings, os- traca, and inscriptions. I think we are entitled to draw the following conclusions: (1) Athenian fifth-century society functioned by and large as a literate society. (2) Even if popular literacy was to a certain degree impeded by the absence of standardized spelling and large-scale book production, its pervasive spread had a profound impact on the intellectual life of Athens and on the development of abstract thought.
