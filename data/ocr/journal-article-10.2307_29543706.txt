<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BARCELONA PAVILION AS LANDSCAPE GARDEN MODERNITY AND THE PICTURESQUE Caroline Constant 'A work of architecture must not stand as a finished and self sufficient object. True and pure imagination, having once entered the stream of the idea that it expresses, has to expand forever beyond this work, and it must venture out, leading ultimately to the infinite. It must be regarded as the point at which one can make an orderly entry into the unbreakable chain of the universe.'1 To propose that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe conceived of his German Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition as a landscape may challenge conventional readings of his architecture, although these have undergone con? siderable re-evaluation since 1986, when the Pavilion was recon? structed on its original site.2 To assert his debt to the Picturesque in this work is a more subversive claim. After all, the Picturesque is associated with emotive appeal, formal eclecticism and artifice, while Mies identified his aims with rationalism, the rejection of formal issues, and realism.3 Mies's debt to the Picturesque is not as precedent; rather, it provides a means to transcend the difficulty of his work. Positing the Barcelona Pavilion within the Picturesque landscape tradition thus elicits speculation about both the build? ing's significance and the repressed role of the Picturesque in modernism. There is only minor evidence in Mies's writings to support this claim, and it concerns a later project. Describing his Museum for a Small City (1943), he argued that 'the barrier between the work of art and the living community is erased by a garden approach for the display.'4 Similarly, the eighteenth-century English landscape garden sought to dissolve the visual distinction between garden and landscape. For Horace Walpole the ha-ha was 'the capital stroke, the leading step to all that has followed'.5 He credited William Kent with the genius to discern its significance: 'He leaped the fence, and saw that all nature was a garden.'6 In the Barcelona Pavilion Mies elaborated that earlier leap. Yet his challenge lay, not in the visual extension of space, as numerous interpretations of the Pavilion have claimed, but rather in the conceptual boundaries of the discipline. Any interpretation of the Barcelona Pavilion as landscape must transcend Mies's tendency, like that of Schinkel (who inspired his early work), to challenge the formal boundaries between archi? tecture and landscape. As Mies argued, 'Form is not the aim of our work but only the result.'7 Indeed, the Pavilion's tectonic means are unquestionably architectural. With no programmatic con? straints other than to represent the democratic Weimar Republic, the commission to design the German Pavilion in Barcelona afforded Mies the freedom to pursue the expressive possibilities of the discipline. During the 1920s he had begun to abandon the formal logic of the classical idiom, with its mimesis of man and nature, in favour of specifically architectural means. Many of Mies's con? temporaries resorted to imagery from other sources, such as engineering, an expedient that bases its claim to validity on that discipline's objective nature. For Mies, however, artistic objec? tivity derived from the assertion of differences rather than meta? phorical similarities. The meaning of the Barcelona Pavilion is not conveyed through a priori formal logic or the representation of some external reality but is given to sensual and temporal ex? perience.8 While immersed in the experience of Mies's pavilion, the spectator is simultaneously distanced from it. Such contradic? tions were nascent in the Picturesque. The Picturesque is an elusive concept.9 Certain discrepancies arise from the term's etymological origins in painting. Alexander Pope first used it, in annotations to his translations of Homer, to refer to a theme appropriate to a history painting ? one that represents a significant human action based on verbal narrative and conveyed iconographically.10 Pope conceived of his garden at Twickenham in analogous terms; it was a locus of human action, its meaning conveyed iconographically to the knowledgeable viewer moving from object to object. By the late eighteenth century, however, the term 'picturesque', as a result of its association with the genre of landscape painting, was more commonly used to refer to the aesthetic qualities of irregularity, roughness and complexity ? and thus to the type of English garden devised to imitate nature. In its appeal to the visual faculty, the Picturesque landscape depen? ded for its meaning on the interpretive powers of the individual imagination. The assertion of aesthetic distance was a primary accomplish? ment of the Picturesque ? an effect simulated by the Claude Glass, a darkened, concave mirror that could reduce a natural scene to fit into the palm of a hand. While it renders Nature an object of manipulation, the Picturesque garden is perceived, not as a thing in itself, but as a series of relationships that are gradually revealed to the moving spectator. For Mies, as for the Picturesque landscape designer, the lack of resolution inherent in such contradictions was the starting-point for the ongoing process of interpretation. The term 'pavilion' was first associated with garden structures for temporary shelter in the late seventeenth century;11 such buildings provided the architectural leitmotif of the English land? scape garden, which emerged in the following century as a vehicle of the new sensibility. Likewise, the Barcelona Pavilion lacked a 46 AA FILES 20</page><page sequence="2">specific programme; rather, it provided a momentary pause in an itinerary through the exposition grounds. Rejecting overt historical references, however, Mies undermined the object status of his structure. There are no fa9ades in the traditional sense. The need for boundaries between inside and outside, functionally necessary in most buildings, does not pertain. Thus the doors, positioned for security rather than to delimit threshold, were removed during exposition opening hours to preserve the spatial continuity. As a result, the Barcelona Pavilion is a labyrinth, a 'montage of con? tradictory, perceptual facts';12 its meaning is generated through the experience of a circuit that suggests parallels with those of the English landscape movement. Early plans (Fig. 1) indicate Mies's explicit use of Picturesque devices. He distributed three pedestals for statues throughout the Pavilion, each positioned to provide a focal point at the end of a major viewing axis. The sequence is analogous to the eighteenth century pictorial circuit ? a series of points at which a view is contrived to arrest the progress of the observer (Fig. 2). Moreover, these moments of stasis punctuate the experience and accentuate the discontinuities between sculpture and architecture, reflecting those between architecture and landscape in the earliest English land? scape gardens. Ultimately, Mies reduced the number of statues to one, that in the inner court (Fig. 1), to increase the continuity of the sequence. There is only one relative point of stasis, and it focuses, not on the statue, but on a wall of onyx doree, which Mies from the early conceptual stages endowed with iconic value. By eliminating these sculptural focal points, he rejected pictorial means and overcame a tendency common to the early Picturesque garden, that of focusing attention on objects rather than the landscape. This momentary pause relies, not on the contrast between architecture and sculpture, but between elements conceived as part of an architectural system and an isolated architectural element, elevated, like the single column in the Temple of Apollo at Bassae, to the level of the sacred.13 Mies's rejection of pictorial means goes beyond that of per? spective. Despite certain formal similarities between his plan for a Brick Country House (1924) and Theo van Doesburg's painting Rhythms of a Russian Dance (1919), Mies denied that there were any de Stijl influences in his work.14 The differences are funda? mental. In their efforts to avoid a static, perspectival vantage point, de Stijl artists sought a more 'objective' point of view, exemplified by the axonometric. Mies departed from this conceptual mode by studying the Pavilion, not in plan, elevation, or axonometric view, but in a three-dimensional model. This consisted of a plasticine base on which planes of celluloid and cardboard covered with Japanese paper, simulating the Pavilion's material qualities, were manipu? lated to capture the perceptual character of the spatial sequence.15 Mies accorded primacy to the temporal experience in three dimensions, rather than to any unified conception of the building.16 In his choice of site Mies also sought to overcome the static quality of a picturesque object terminating a vista. He therefore rejected the original site, the indented corner of the Palace of Alfonso XIII to one side of the exposition's main axis, in favour of a site ending the major transverse axis. It lies along the primary route to the Spanish Village, a popular exposition attraction. Thus the Pavilion acts as a threshold between the formal layout of the Exposition grounds and a picturesque pastiche of Spanish vernacu? lar house types. This role was accentuated by a line of free-standing columns that originally framed the site, testimony to a prior histor icist impulse. This colonnade was an essential element of the sequence, a portent of the discontinuities that lay within. Mies's desire to control the visual sequence, evident in his 1.

The site offered the possibility of an extended view in only one direction, that of the approach, yet Mies thwarted any such extension by devising a series of non-aligned, transverse walls, in order to limit visual expansion to the Pavilion's longitudinal dimension, which he bracketed with end walls (Fig. 5). For Mies the walls were the primary agents in the spatial sequence, unlike Le Corbusier, whose concept of the free plan relied on the structural and conceptual primacy of the columns. Mies's columns, intro? duced at a later stage in the design (Fig. 1), remained structurally ambiguous.17 His later recollection of the project reflects this difference: 'One evening as I was working late on the building I made a sketch of a free-standing wall, and I got a shock. I knew it was a new principle.'18 The distinction between 'object' and 'system' at the Barcelona Pavilion is relative, as there is no overriding geometric system. The cruciform columns delimit only approximate squares. Further? more, Mies used the paving grid to provide visual rather than mathematical order, adjusting the dimensions of the travertine blocks to align with the joints in the vertical surfaces. The spatial continuity is perceptual. The result is not 'universal' space, but space as a palpable entity ? a conceit that relies on separation rather than unity.19 While classical space results from the unified, hierarchical treatment of architectural elements, Mies gave priority neither to space nor to the elements, calling to mind Sidney Robinson's distinction between [classical] system and Picturesque 'connection': System, of course, clearly sets the terms for the connection of constituent parts. Discovering the rule explains everything. Picturesque 'connection' is always in the process of being discovered. Saying what it is, finally, is not quite possible without reference to a level of abstraction which strikes one as begging the issue.20 The podium and columnar grid are frequently cited as evidence of Mies's tendency to resort to classicism.21 Yet neither is perceived as a whole: the end walls and reflecting pools interrupt the podium surface, while the spurious reading of the columns as a classical colonnade is possible only in plan. As Jose Quetglas has noted, each column exists in a distinct spatial context.22 Mies's shimmering cruciform columns support a similar contradiction: their formal precision dissolves under the visual distortion of their polished steel surfaces (Fig. 5). Rather than refer to some external reality, these elements all serve, like the partitions or roof slab, as mute testimony to the symbolic essence of architecture. In its silence Mies's architecture is cacophonous.23 The Pavilion is a montage of independent systems: travertine slab and plaster ceiling, chromium columns and marble partitions.(of travertine, Tinian, verd-antique and onyx doree), together with various tints of glass (brown, green, milk, blue and black), all colliding visually in the polished, reflective surfaces (Fig. 5). The precision of the materials contrasts with their perceptual instability. Unlike the type of optical devices popular in the eighteenth century, which pro? vided an illusion of control over nature, the reflective surfaces of Mies's Pavilion simulate the temporal flux of nature. Mies subjected all natural elements in the Pavilion to archi? tectural control. Vines are captured in a continuous planter atop the travertine walls of the entry court, while the lustrous green Tinian marble in the inner court echoes the cluster of trees beyond, affirming the distance between architecture and nature. The rear garden, a semicircular swathe level with the podium, was con? ceived as an extension of the Pavilion: its origin is in architecture rather than nature. 'Nature' exists by virtue of architecture, a human construct, inverting Schinkel's famous dictum, 'Architec 48 AA FILES 20</page><page sequence="4">ture is the continuation of nature in her constructive activity.'24 Water was for Mies a material comparable to marble or steel. The inner pool, originally lined with black glass tiles, created the paradoxical illusion of limitless depth in the solid earth, contrasting with the outer pool, tiled with blue glass (Fig. 5), which appeared shallow and reflected the infinite sky. Glass was a material of similar paradoxes. Not simply a transparent medium, it was a means to condition perception and shape space, as he demonstrated with his Project for a Glass Skyscraper, of 1922, and his Glass Room for the 1927 Stuttgart Werkbund exhibition (Fig. 7). In a propagandist statement written for the Union of Plate Glass Manu? facturers, he extolled its material properties: 'Only now can we give shape to space, open it, and link it to the landscape, thereby satisfying modern man's spatial needs.'25 Recent interpretations of Mies's use of glass vary from that of Tegethoff, who considers it 'the single, absolute prerequisite for a new conception of space ... by means of which space-defining walls may be reduced to a mere transparent membrane',26 to Tafiiri and Dal Co, who see it as 'an insuperable boundary'.27 Although glass could be regarded as the modern equivalent of the ha-ha, Mies was concerned primarily with its phenomenal qualities. Describing his Friedrichstrasse Sky? scraper of 1921 (Fig. 4), he explained: 'I discovered by working with actual glass models that the important thing is the play of reflections and not the effect of light and shadow as in ordinary buildings.'28 His use of tinted glass in the Barcelona Pavilion ? particularly the subtle distinction between the green glass facing the inner court and the brown tint of that to the front and back ? is a reminder that knowledge is contingent on perception. Such 'insol? uble dichotomies'29 ground the Pavilion in reality and open it to creative interpretation. Mies's realism derived from his conception of order, which dis? tanced him from the Utopian aspirations of the Modern Movement. In his inaugural address at the Armour Institute of Technology (1938), he argued that 'the idealistic principle of order . . . with its overemphasis on the ideal and the formal, satisfies neither our inter? est in simple reality nor our practical sense. So we shall emphasize the organic principle of order. '30 This celebrates difference rather than imposing similarity, as he later elaborated: 'The real order is what St Augustine said about the disposition of equal and unequal things according to their nature.'31 Three elements fall outside this limited systemic treatment: the onyx wall, the luminous wall and George Kolbe's statue, Morning. The onyx wall (Fig. 5) is the Pavilion's only interior partition and the only one of this material, one of the world's rarest and costliest marbles. Its numinous quality derives from its distinctive colour rather than its material treatment, which links it with other elements of the 'inner sanctum'. Contrary to claims put forward by some critics, that the size of the onyx block determined a module for the structure, it merely determined the Pavilion's height and the length of the wall itself, which varies somewhat in the early plan studies. Indeed, Mies was careful to avoid mathematical correspondences among the Pavilion's components.32 The onyx wall marks the only relative point of repose in the composition, a deliberate departure from the conventional idea of shelter. The wall clings to the jet-black carpet at its base, as if by magnetic force. This is an attraction of opposites, for the carpet is a visual abyss, denying the possibility of occupation. This double paradox is underscored by its function as a dais for the white leather 'thrones' that Mies designed for the King and Queen of Spain, who were to participate in the opening ceremonies. The implied stasis of the onyx wall is further disrupted by the horizontal seam at eye level that splits the partition in two. It recalls the horizon, reinforcing the reading of the interior as a landscape, 5. German Pavilion, Barcelona, 1929.

Curiously, however, there has been little mention of an equally significant phenomenon: the luminous volume (Fig. 6) that lies closer to the Pavilion's geometric centre. It appears only peripherally in the published photographs; moreover, its sensual qualities seem to elude photographic representation. This inaccessible void bounded by etched glass was the only building element that Mies adjusted to conform to the paving grid (Fig. 1). Originally conceived as a thin, wall-like element, it was ultimately realized as a volume of light. Embodying an element of nature, it has certain attributes of a courtyard but, like the entry court and the inner sculpture court, it can be occupied only in the imagination. A comparable luminosity in the inner court (Fig. 6), which is continually bathed in sunlight, is visible upon mounting the podium and serves to draw the spectator in. In contrast, the ineffable qualities of the luminous wall can be perceived only from within. Its end walls of verd-antique marble and black glass (Fig. 6) render it invisible from the entry stair or rear garden, while the sunlight of the outer court counteracts its phenomenal presence from that direction (Fig. 5). There is a precedent in Mies's work for this 'garden of light'. In his Glass Room for the Werkbund exhibition, he included two inaccessible spaces: a sculpture court and a garden court. The first of these two spaces, bounded by glass walls and housing a female torso by the sculptor Leehmbruck (Fig. 7), accentuated the simul? taneously transparent and reflective properties of glass.34 The statue seems entombed in a world removed from human occu? pation. The second court, containing three ungainly potted plants (Fig. 7), was the only space in the exhibition not bounded by glass or capped by stretched fabric. While it provided a suggestion of open air within an enclosed volume, it was at the same time remote from nature, rendering it a lifeless relic, framed and isolated for the purpose of contemplation. In contrast, the luminous court of the Barcelona Pavilion has an ineffable quality. Its light seems to emanate magically from within, like the autonomous light source of a cubist painting. Nature is rendered as light within an architectural frame of steel and glass, a garden in the machine. The luminous court alludes to the spiritual otherness of nature, its objectification, in contrast to the naive aspiration for communion with nature that was associated with Modern Movement ideals. For Mies architecture was a vehicle for nature to reveal itself to man. Kolbe's statue (Fig. 6) is the Pavilion's only anthropomorphic element. Axially aligned within the innermost court, it dominates a space denied to human occupation. Rather than providing a goal in the sequence, it stands for the absent spectator. Like the contrived, scenographic effects of the Picturesque garden, Mies's architecture renders the spectator an active participant in the scene; yet here the stage remains empty, the actor/spectator distanced. Grete Tugendhat has described the effects of Mies's architecture on its occupants in similar terms: 'For just as one sees each flower in this room in quite an uncommon way, and every piece of art seems more expressive (for example, a piece of sculpture standing in front of the onyx wall), so too a person appears, both to himself and to others, to be more clearly set off from his surroundings.'35 Despite its overwhelming interiority, the Pavilion resists inhabitation. The role of the spectator is fleeting, transitory. The reflective surfaces of glass, polished marble and chromium-plated steel absorb any human presence, casting doubt even on the body's own substance, 50 AA FILES 20</page><page sequence="6">just as the Pavilion's architectural language denies its metaphoric presence. The self merges with the other as fleeting ephemera in the cumulative layers of reflection. Unlike the tendency of the Picturesque to miniaturize architec? ture, Kolbe's statue expands the Pavilion's apparent scale. The ob? server, measuring himself against the oversized figure (Fig. 6), is humbled. This experience of the statue within the labyrinthine con? figuration augments the Pavilion's material presence to overcome its seeming limitation of size. Mies's structure rivals the massive palace of Alfonso XIII on the hill directly above, yet it does so through anti-classical means ? denial of its object status and of symbolic references to man or nature. The luminous wall, the onyx dor?e wall and the statue are unique elements in the Pavilion: all participate in its hierarchical 'centre'. As a sequence they refer respectively to the metaphysical realm, the material realm and the realm of human occupation, representing the paradoxical means by which Mies strove 'to bring Nature, man, and architecture together in a higher unity'36 ? by asserting their mutual distance. Just as each element asserts its independent status, so the Pavilion asserts its independence from the context to which it is inextricably bound. Approached from the symmetrical transverse axis, the podium establishes a caesura with the classical space of the Expos? ition grounds, creating the world anew and celebrating architecture as a human construct. The podium is a boundary, a templum of space hewn out of the surrounding landscape, replacing the garden wall. Mies denied it any classical reference to the earth or to its axial approach; instead, the end walls ground the Pavilion in the earth, and the entrance is displaced to one side. Behind the Pavilion, however, Mies reversed this arrangement by raising the ground to the level of the podium and re-establishing the symmetry of the approach. In the transverse direction, travertine walls that echo the base of the adjoining palace terminate the expansive walls of green Tinian marble that reflect the canopy of surrounding trees. The Pavilion arises from the particular circumstances of the site, yet dis? tances itself from the classical conditions of its context. It is both a critical reinterpretation of its worldly situation and an affirmation of reality. Irreducibly architectural, the Pavilion was a vehicle for Mies to dismantle the dialectic opposition of the city and the country and to recompose a continuum conceived in terms of landscape. Mies's experience as a youth of assisting in the family marble atelier in Aachen, and his early admiration for the work of Schinkel and Berlage, undoubtedly contributed to his obsession with the visual properties of materials. A more direct influence, however, was his collaboration during the 1920s and 1930s with Lily Reich, a textile and fashion designer, and fellow member of the Deutscher Werkbund, with whom he designed a number of exhibition install? ations, including that in Barcelona. Their Silk and Velvet Cafe at the 1927 Berlin fashion exposition (Fig. 8), which celebrated the fluid, diaphanous and reflective properties of these fabrics, was a significant precursor to the Barcelona Pavilion, where Mies achieved similar effects with the solidity of marble, steel and glass. Yet this concern with materials also had a deeper, philosophical basis, for Spengler's The Decline of the West had inspired Mies to attempt to transcend the 'material' implications of post Enlightenment 'civilization' by reinstating the 'spiritual' dimen? sions of 'culture'.37 The material qualities of the Barcelona Pavilion parallel those of an element of early English landscape gardens ? the grotto, such as that of c. 1724 in the base of Alexander Pope's house at Twicken? ham (Fig. 9).38 This grotto incorporated an elaborate display of the poet's extensive collection of mineral specimens, modelled on the type of Italian grotto that eighteenth-century British visitors 7.

Ferrante Imperato 's museum in Naples, from his Historia Naturale, Naples, 1599. described as a cabinet of curiosities, an antecedent of the modern museum. Indeed, Pope proclaimed his grotto a 'Musaeum', or home of the muses.39 Moreover, his concern with visual effects is reflected in the two optical devices he incorporated in the grotto: it operated both as a 'perspectival glass' through which to view the river from the Shell Temple that stood in the garden opposite and as a sort of camera obscura which projected images of the outside world upon the grotto's reflective interior surfaces.40 These con? tributed to its power, like the garden itself, both to signify a world apart and to be a mirror of the larger world. A visitor of 1747 described its effects in terms that are startlingly reminiscent of the Barcelona Pavilion: To multiply this Diversity, and still more increase the Delight, Mr. Pope's poetic Genius has introduced a kind of Machinery, which performs the same Part in the Grotto that supernal Powers and incorporeal Beings act in the heroick Species of Poetry: This is effected by disposing Plates of Looking glass in the obscure Parts of the Roof and Sides of the Cave, where sufficient Force of Light is wanting to discover the Deception, while the other parts, the Rills, Fountains, Flints, Pebbles, etc. being duly illuminated, are so reflected by the various posited Mirrors, as without exposing the Cause, every Object is multiplied, and its Position repre? sented in a surprising Diversity. . . . Thus, by a fine taste and happy Management of Nature, you are presented with an undistinguishable Mixture of Realities and Imagery.41 It is well known that Pope and his circle, which included Lord Burlington and William Kent, intended that their gardens should serve a larger aim, that of embodying on English soil a classical civilization emulating that of the ancients. Unlike its antique counterparts, however, Pope's grotto ? like the Barcelona Pavilion ? incorporated no allusions to literature or mythology. Its effects were conveyed primarily through an appeal to the individual imagination. As John Dixon Hunt has argued, Pope's vision was distinguished by 'this very awareness of what could not be achieved, except in the mind's eye.'42 In the Barcelona Pavilion Mies deployed a similar strategy. Charged with designing a German Repr?sentationsraum, with implications for serving formal or ceremonial rather than utilitarian purposes, he rejected emblematic motifs or signs. The architecture alone expresses the Pavilion's role as a symbol of the modern, progressive state of Germany, represented internationally for the first time in Barcelona. Two flags flanking the entrance were its sole representational devices. There is another, more immediate parallel to Mies's use of materials: the Italian grotto as a conspectus of natural and artificial wonders had a counterpart in the Wunderkammer (Fig. 10).43 The collection was seen as a metaphor for the world. Its underlying order, like that of the Pavilion, was based on aesthetic rather than scientific criteria, with objects grouped according to material, for example. The Barcelona Pavilion shares with the Wunderkammer the aim of epitomizing a sense of mystery and wonder rather than offering rational explication. Where the cabinet of curiosities orig? inated in response to the crisis of values following the breakdown of Renaissance certainties, Mies's Pavilion reflects a comparable phenomenon during the post-Enlightenment era. Historically, the garden has been an essential form of expres? sion ? a reflection of man's relationship to nature and a re constitution of the world in microcosm. That role has been largely abrogated in the twentieth century. Once the art of garden? ing began to dissociate itself from architecture and ally itself with landscape, it attained its greatest cultural significance, yet simul? taneously initiated its decline as a fine art.44 Like the garden, the Barcelona Pavilion is a pure instrument of meaning: it represents 52 AA FILES 20</page><page sequence="8">11. Mies van der Rohe: Tugendhat |HHH| House. Brno, Czechoslovakia, 1930. ^^^^M Living room. ^^^^H I I ^^^^ ?y^^" "*"^* .^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ a break with reality, constituted historically, yet poses itself as an alternative reality. Here Mies revealed the possibility to transcend the decorative and sentimental limits of the modern garden and to recover its intrinsic value, without resort to mimesis, by reinstating its architectural essence. He created an architecture analogous to the fleeting understanding of a world where absolutes are no longer possible. His affirmation of the power of architecture to embody a fragmented, fractured world view is indebted to the reversal of the traditional hierarchy of architecture and landscape that took place in the eighteenth century. As David Watkin has argued, rather than conceive of landscape as an extension of architecture, the Pictur? esque provided the inspiration to conceive of architecture as land? scape.45 Mies's work transcends the eighteenth-century distinction between a rationalized and a representational view of nature, a formal debate that still has not subsided. The distinction between the geometric garden and the 'natural' garden was itself a product of the Picturesque emphasis on formal values. Each is contrived, the product of human action; each was inspired by the dialectic between formal and informal that existed in the gardens of antiquity and of Renaissance Italy. The differences lie primarily in diverging attitudes to nature and to man's role in the natural world.46 Mies rejected the myth of raw nature as a pure datum, independent of human action, that was being promoted by the Modern Movement; instead, nature exists only by virtue of being interpreted. Mies overcame the pictorial limitations of the Picturesque. Transcending the appearance of nature, he affirmed the power of architecture to achieve the status of nature. Mies's fleeting accomplishment depended on the idea of nature as something that is physically remote. With the conservatories of the Tugendhat house (Fig. 11) and the Nolde house, the gardens of the court-houses, and the scenic views from the Resor house and the Farns worth house, he returned to a pictorial treatment of nature. Nature was again enframed, its eighteenth-century status restored. For Mies the contemplation of nature from afar was superior to experiencing it directly: 'When you see nature through the glass walls of the Farns worth House, it gets a deeper meaning than [from] outside. More is asked for from nature, because it becomes a part of a larger whole.'47 Mies transformed the Picturesque dichotomy between stasis and motion into a dichotomy of form and perception, thereby dis? allowing any stable interpretation. Meaning is initiated rather than imposed, recalling the idea of the Picturesque circuit as a route to knowledge. If the Picturesque introduced the element of doubt, Mies recognized the potential for creative interpretation that accompanies a modern perspective of the limitations of knowledge. With the Barcelona Pavilion, he modified pur understanding of the Picturesque to invest it with a generative importance that it had previously lacked, exemplifying the aim of modernism not simply to break with the historical past but, rather, 'to attempt to equal its highest achievements under new and difficult conditions'.48 The Barcelona Pavilion fulfils Mies's dictum that 'Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space; living, changing, new. '49 Its shifting nuances of meaning reflect 'the central problem of our time ? the intensification of life.'50 Schinkel put it less succinctly: 'Striving, budding, crystallizing, unfolding, driving, splitting, fit? ting, drifting, floating, pulling, pressing, bending, bearing, plac? ing, vibrating, connecting, holding, lying and resting . . . these are the ways in which architecture must manifest life.'51 Notes 1.

Eighteenth-century discussions of the Picturesque vary, from focusing on the qualities of the object, to the psychological effects on the moving spectator. Such discrepancies were the basis of the 'Picturesque Controversy' carried on by Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price during the 1790s. Yve-Alain Bois remarks on the mutually exclusive moments of the Picturesque in 'A Picturesque Stroll Around Clara-Clara', October!*) (Summer 1984), p. 36. 10. Pope never applied the term 'picturesque' to landscape, although in other contexts he generally used it to refer to a setting appropriate to themes depicted in poetry or painting. John Dixon Hunt, 'Ut Pictura Poesis, Ut Pictura Hortus, and the Picturesque', Word and Image I, no. 1 (Jan-March 1985), pp. 88-90. 11. The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford, 1971), p.572. 12. Hays (1984), p. 24. Mies claimed that, when the German government first approached him about the commission, he replied: 'What is a pavilion? I have not the slightest idea. . . . I must say that it was the most difficult work which ever confronted me, because I was my own client; I could do what I liked. But I did not know what a pavilion should be.' Quoted in H. T. Cadbury Brown, 'Ludwig Mies van der Rohe', Architectural Association Journal (July August 1959), pp. 27-8. 13. See Ludwig Glaeser, Mies van der Rohe: The Barcelona Pavilion (New York, 1979), unpaginated. He deems the onyx wall equivalent to an altarpiece. Cited in Tegethoff (1985), p. 81. Tegethoff also finds analogies between the inner court and the cella of a Greek temple: neither can be occupied except by the cult figure ? in the Pavilion, Kolbe's statue. Ibid. p. 80. 14. On Mondrian's influence, Mies stated: 'I think that was a mistake that the Museum of Modern Art made. ... I never make a painting when I want to build a house. We like to draw our plans carefully and that is why they were taken as a kind of painting.' Quoted in Peter Carter, Mies van der Rohe at Work (New York, 1974), p. 180. 15. Tegethoff (1985), p. 75. 16. Mies's interest in repetition in the later work was a variation on this idea. 17. As Robin Evans notes, the columns, owing to their extremely thin propor? tions, appear insufficient to support the roof; indeed, the steel frame support? ing the marble walls contributes equally to the Pavilion's structural stability. Lecture, Harvard Graduate School of Design, 20 October 1988. 18. Interview, 13 February 1952: '6 Students Talk with Mies', Master Builder, stu? dent publication of the School of Design, North Carolina State College, vol. 2, no. 3 (spring 1952), p. 28. Credit for discovering the free plan must go to Le Corbusier; he first published 'Five Points of a New Architecture', in Alfred Roth, Zwei Wohnhauser von Le Corbusier und Pierre Jeanner et (Stuttgart, 1928), pp. 8-9, in conjunction with the housing project he carried out with Pierre Jeanneret for the Wiessenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart, which Mies directed. 19. In this Mies acknowledged the influence of Schinkel 's Altes Museum: 'He separated the elements, the columns and the walls and the ceiling, and I think that is still visible in my later buildings.'

The grotto survives, although the house was demolished in 1807; by 1760, Pope's successor to the property, William Stanhope, had mutilated the garden beyond recognition, according to Horace Walpole.

'From the River Thames, you see thru' my Arch up a Walk of the Wilderness to a kind of open Temple, wholly composed of Shells in the Rustic Manner; and from that distance under the Temple you look down thru' a sloping Arcade of Trees, and see the Sails on the River passing suddenly and vanishing, as thru' a Perspective Glass. When you shut the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the instant, from a luminous Room, a Camera Obscura: on the Walls of which all the objects of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats, are forming a moving Picture in their visible Radiations: And when you have a mind to light it up, it.aff?rds you a very different Scene: its finished with Shells interspersed with Pieces of Looking-glass in angular forms; and in the Ceiling is a Star of the same Material, at which when a Lamp (of an orbicular Figure of thin Alabaster) is hung in the Middle, a thousand pointed Rays glitter and are reflected over the Place.'
