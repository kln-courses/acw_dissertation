WALTER FEWKES The Assault on the Shield-bearer Unfortunately I missed, both at Walpi and at Oraibi, in 1897, that most interesting episode of the Soydlu'ia, the assault of the shield-bearers; but as my notes on the 1891 dramatization are ex- tensive, although not wholly satisfactory, I have quoted them from my account of the Soydlu'a in " Tusayan Katcinas," hitherto cited. I was able to examine several of the shields, which are ordinarily tied up in cloth and concealed in the pueblo. There seems to be some variation in the details of the assault on the shield-bearer each year, and considerable difference between the Oraibi and the Walpi variants, and their meaning can be deter- mined only by more exhaustive studies of the Soy"luia in these pueblos and in the three villages of the Middle mesa where it has thus far escaped the observation of ethnologists. During the ceremony most of the participants acted as a chorus, squatting on the floor of the room, filling all available space save that in the middle of the room, between the fireplace and the altar. They were naked save for a scant breech-clout, and were painted with white earth. The heat was stifling, and at the close of the dance the perspiration poured down their bodies and limbs. Notwithstanding this fact, however, many of them went out into the cold, frosty air from the heated room without covering of any kind, and several ran to Sitcomovi, the neighboring pueblo. The spectators then left the kiva, and a frenzied dance of strange character occurred. The societies from other kivas came in, and the chief of each declaimed in a half-chanting voice, 14 (101)</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST VOLUME XI, PLATE II ::i:-:: ::::: :::::: i:-i :-::i:i: ::::::::::: i:::::::-:: ::::::: Drawn by Mary M Leighter SUN SHIELD OF THE HORN SOCIETY</page><page sequence="3">102 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. XI which rose to a shriek at the close of a stanza. First he drew back to the fireplace and then with a shuffling gait approached the symbolic opening in the floor, called the sipapl. Anawita then shouted at the top of his voice, and the shuffler sprang in the air and vaulted over the sipapid. Then everybody in the room shouted lustily, and a song in concert followed. A moment later the visiting societies dashed down the ladder, each bear- ing a splendid shield ornamented with a rim of radiating eagle feathers. Each society had its own distinctive shield, which on entering was handed to the chief. As he received it he stamped on the sipapt4 and a vigorous song was sung. Meanwhile two members of the society stood apart from their fellows against the southern wall, facing each other, each holding a squash-flower emblem in a bouquet of spruce twigs and an ear of corn in his left hand. Suddenly the fifteen or twenty members of the society drew back from their chief, who then sprang upon the sipapi plank and, quickly turning, faced them as all burst forth in an ecstatic shouting, with wild flinging of their arms as they approached the shield-bearers. They naturally formed two clusters, and as the shield-bearer dashed his shield in their faces they surged back, to leap again toward him. This seeming assault, wild though it appeared, was maintained in time with the song. The two chieftains joined their men, all in ecstatic frenzy, and one of them, shaking his shield, sprang from right to left, drawing back his assistants in rhythm with the beating of the feet all on the floor. It has been suggested that this assault of the men on the bearer of the sun-shield dramatizes the attack on the sun by hostile powers, and that its object is to offset malign influences or to draw back the sun from a disappearance suggested by its southern declination. In this possible interpretation it is well to consider that immediately preceding it the archaic offerings and prayers to the Great Snake were made as described, in the pres- ence of spectators. Public Dance on the Day Following Totokya At 2 P. M. on December 21st, Supela, followed by a man dressed as a katcina and two others as katcina-maids, emerged from the hatchway of the Mofkiva, having previously performed their dance several times in the same kiva. The katcina wore the</page><page sequence="4">Apr. 1898] WINTER SOLSTICE CEREMONY AT WALPI 103 helmet which had stood on the stack of corn at the altar, and the two personators of the maids had their faces hidden by the two masquettes, also from the pile of corn. The katcina wore the prescribed ceremonial kilt, with sash, knit open-work leggins, and moccasins. In one hand he carried a staff consisting of a straight rod, to the extremity of which feathers, mammal skins, and red horsehair were tied. Each katcina-maid bore before her a tiiimi, the flat basket with vertical ears of corn arranged in a ring, as elsewhere described. The katcina carried in his left hand a flat slat of wood or moi~kohu, to which an ear of corn was at- tached. As they emerged from the kiva hatch the three masked personages stood in line, and Supela, who wore his ordinary clothes, was just in front of them. Supela then dropped a little sacred meal on the ground, and the katcina rapped the earth FIG. 2-EFFIGY OF THE PLUMIED SNAKE several times with his staff, after which the three began a song and dance, which lasted but a few moments. Supela then led the katciua and two katcina-maids to the main plaza in front of the Snake rock, where the same simple ceremony was performed twice, the personations in all cases facing east. He then led them to the neighborhood of the Tcivatokiva, and later back to the vicinity of the moikiva, from which they started. In all these halts the same song was sung and the same simple dance performed. The katcina and his attendant maids then retired to the Mo~kiva. A large crowd had assembled to witness the last presentation of this dance, and a line of women had crowded themselves into the narrow passageway connecting the two Walpi plazas, the covered court which extends between the Snake rock and the Wikwaliobikiva. This crowd tarried after the katcina had disap-</page><page sequence="5">104 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. XI peared, and soon the reason was evident. Supela and other priests came up from the kiva, each bearing many ears of corn, which were laid in baskets on the ground near the hatchway. The women pressed forward and each one received an armful. This corn was from the altar and will later serve as the seed- corn, which, in their belief, had been prepared for planting by this ceremonial fertilization. A large number of prayer-sticks were made by the priests on the days following the Soydluia, and a large quantity of these were deposited in shrines about the pueblos, especially in and near the shrine east of Walpi, or midway between that pueblo and Sitcomovi. The appearance of this shrine on the morning following the night exercises of totokya was most interesting, for it was full of the willow wands with attached feathers and pine- needles which had decorated the roof of the kiva. There were also many of these offerings in the shrine at the gap in the mesa, east of Hano. For four days after the night ceremonies the whitened elk- horns remained on the hatch of the Mofkiva, and a watchman was in attendance, but no ceremonies were witnessed. Interpretation of Soydluia It appears to me that we should guard against confounding the present object and the real meaning of rites in our attempted interpretation of ceremonies. The object of a ceremony may change when a people change their environment, or as their prayers change. Ancient rites are thus made to do duty for purposes wholly new and thereby become greatly modified, so far as their objects are concerned. The tendency always is to adapt old rites to new conditions, and interpret them accord- ingly. The true meaning of those rites is thus lost. The per- sistency with which ceremonials survive as compared with the changes in beliefs concerning their object makes the study of ceremoniology a most important aspect of religion. The identity of the man who personified a bird was detected early in the exercises, but I was not wholly sure of the truth of this identification until I had witnessed the night ceremonials at Oraibi. Anawita later confirmed my conclusion that the Bird- man was no other than the War-god, Kwataka, a cultus hero of the Warrior societies, of which Soydlu~a is the great festival.</page><page sequence="6">Apr. 1898] WINTER SOLSTICE CEREMONY AT WALPI 105 The Soydluia-mana or maid, who danced with the War-god on the plank of the sipapi, as described in previous pages, so far as dress and facial decoration are concerned, is the same female personification who appears again and again in so many great Walpi celebrations. This is the girl with the black chin and white band of pigment across her cheeks, identical with Teiia- mana, the Snake-maid; Lenya-mana, the Flute-maid; Lakone- mana, Mamzrau-mana, Calako-mana, the Corn-maid. She is here called Soydlu~a-mana, the totemic sacerdotal name of the Corn- maid among the Pdtki people. In the Oraibi celebration the dramatic representation of Kwa- taka was even more realistic than at Walpi, and there were many variations in his dance which I cannot now describe. Of par- ticular interest, however, was the fact that the personator was at a certain time in the dance furnished with bow and arrow which he pointed in sequence to the cardinal points. Kwataka is the patron of warriors, the War-god, and the bow and arrow are most suggestive in this association. The Soydlula-maid also danced with Kwataka in the Oraibi kiva, but she was not decorated or dressed as at Walpi, and the nature of her dance was likewise different. As I have elsewhere discussed at length the reappearance of this maid in different Hopi ceremonials, I will refer to my former writings' on this point. It is here sufficient to state that she bears the same relation to the Soydlu~a ceremony as the Snake- maid does to the Snake dance, or the Flute-maid to the Flute observance, and her name, Soydilua-mana, is simply a society name of the same personage. The studies of the Soydluwla which have been recorded in the preceding pages, imperfect as they are, have convinced me that they add new evidence that the Hopi ritual is composite, or that we have in this elaborate ritual a mosaic of clan totem rites, each one of which has its characteristics. While this analysis and reduction to clan totemism is not difficult in certain great cere- monies, as the Snake dance or Flute observance, where the lim- itation of the rites to the family or clan is apparent, it is more difficult in instances like the Soydluiia, where, as it would ap- pear, several religious societies, composed of all the important 1 " Morphology of Tusayan Altars," American Anthropologist, May, 1897; "Tusayan Snake Ceremonies," 16th Annual Report, Bureau of American Ethnology.</page><page sequence="7">106 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. XI families of the pueblo, are concerned. From an example where the priesthood is taken mainly from one phratry, to which, in ancient times, before consolidation with other families, it must have been limited, we have passed to one in which religious so- cieties are recruited from as many families as there are in the pueblo. Notwithstanding this composition and modification, which naturally must have resulted from the drifting together of several families and their intermarriage, the religious clan to- temism of the Pitki family predominates in this their peculiar ceremony. The totems of the PTtki peoples are partly vegetal, as the corn, but mostly inanimate objects, the highest kinds of clan totems. Here we find Sun, Rain-cloud, and like clans. There are Sun clans at Middle mesa and Oraibi which are associated with the Pakab or Reed people, and in Hano there was likewise a Sun clan ;1 but all these Sun clans are reputed to have come from the south. The religious totemism of Sun and Rain-cloud clans is sun and rain worship. The Soydluia, while containing elements foreign to zob-totem- ism, is mainly of the same nature, and is of the same general character as those instances of clan totemism in which the totem is some animal. The parent clan totem of this, as of other Hopi components, has taken a dual anthropomorphic form or male- and-female cult ancestors. The general features of the Soydluia and the nature of its clan totemism stamp it as the ceremonial of a people who have been agriculturists, under the influences of an arid environment, for a longer time than some of the other Hopi families. If, as I suspect, the nucleus of the ancient Hopi pueblo of Walpi, viz, the Snake people, were kindred to the rude Shoshonean people of the north, from which direction they say they came, we should not expect to find rain-worship so highly developed among them as among the Plki, who joined them from the far south," where rain-worship had reached a much 1 The last survivor of the Sun clan at Hano was Kalacai, who died a few years ago. 2 The most of the totems of the Pdtki people are powers of nature, appropriately wor- shipped by the agriculturist, rather than animal gods, more characteristic of hunters. Among them we find the rain-cloud, sun, lightning, and corn predominating. These totems we would expect to find among agriculturists and imply sedentary conditions of life. Among the Snake peoples the reptile is the clan totem, and, although they also are agriculturists, the intimation would be that they have not been so long in this con- dition as the Pdtki. They still preserve the animal clan totem, a survival of ancient non-agricultural culture, but we detect in them traces of a late adoption of an agricul- tural status, as compared with clans where rain-clouds and corn are more common.</page><page sequence="8">Apr. 1898] WINTER SOLSTICE CEREMONY AT WALPI 107 higher development, and where it was affected more profoundly by the higher Mexican culture. It will be seen from the preceding pages that the first god to arrive in the kiva in the celebration of Soydluia at Walpi was the War-god, Kwataka, personified by the Bird-man. In the Mexican variant of the return of the gods, called Teotleco, the War-god was also the first arrival.' There follow in the Soycdluia personifications of other supernaturals, as the Corn-maid and Eototo, the leader of the katcinas. The strange being Eototo is an important personage in the cere- monies called Powdmi and Nimdn, two leading katcina observ- ances. He is personated by K~tci, chief of the K6kop or Firewood people, and is regarded as a god of growth, a being connected with the metamorphosis and growth of corn, but his exact status in the Hopi Olympus is not evident. It is an interesting fact, in this connection, that the same man, Kitci, who personifies Eototo, makes the paho to Masauw4, the god of metamorphosis, growth, and possibly death. There are strong reasons, then, for the belief that Eototo has some intimate relation to Masauwid, and I suspect they may be the same person under different names. At all events, Eototo is the first of the katcinas to return to the pueblos, and at their departure he led them to their distant home in Nfivatikcyobi, the "Place of the high snows," or the San Fran- cisco mountains, at the celebration of the Nimin, or Farewell katcina, in July. There is little doubt that the return of the katcinas is cele- brated in the Soyluwla, notwithstanding I had some misgivings on that point when my memoir on "Tusayan Katcinas" was written. The association of the advent of the katcinas with the winter solstice will lead to our regarding this yearly coming and going of these totemic ancestors as intimately connecting them with sun-worship. The katcinas, or deified totemic ancestors of clans, which include not only animal, but also plant totems and those of inanimate objects, forces, or powers of nature, are thus con- nected with sun-worship, following the sun when, in July, he re- treats from the villages, and returning when he turns from his "house " to approach the pueblos and warm their fields for cul- 1 His advent in Mexico was known by a footprint in sacred meal. At Walpi the ar- rival of the War-god is preceded by balls of meal thrown on the kiva floor.</page><page sequence="9">108 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. XI tivation. The presence of katcinas in the Soydluia is due to culture contact, a later addition to the religion of the Pdtki people. There are, I believe, several aspects of the worship of PilIikoi, so prominent on the night of the Soydlu~a totokya. The main element which is embodied in the dance of the Bird-man and the Soydlu~a-maid is a dramatization of the fructification of the earth and of imparting virility to the seeds of corn. This is pos- sibly the reason for the much greater complexity of the Bird-man dance at Oraibi, where the snake effigy is absent, than at Walpi, where it is so prominent. The stack of corn on the altar is thus endowed with a vitality which it otherwise would not have. I have no new suggestion to make in regard to the meaning of the apparent assault on the sun-bearer, as a realistic dramati- zation of the hostile gods upon the sun to draw him back on his accustomed course. Yet there still remains much to be deter- mined in regard to this episode which eludes me, and I am con- fident that I am not yet in a position to interpret this part sat- isfactorily. There is no doubt, however, that sun-workhip in a most complicated form is one of the marked features of the Warrior ceremony of Soydluia. In other publications I have devoted much space, but not more than necessary, in showing that two dominant elements of the ritual-rain-making and growth of corn-are ihost impor- tant in all Hopi ceremonials. While I thought that the same would probably be found true also of the Soy6dluiia, I had not suspected that they would assume the prominence which they have in this celebration. The nucleus of the Soydluia is a ceremony of the Pdtki people, but at the same time it is a synchronous meeting of the religious societies of many other clans, which perform at that festival their own distinctive rites, which are only distantly connected with that of the Sun-priesthood. The prayers for increase of domestic animals, to which I have referred, are apparently of minor importance, but play a considerable r6le in the Soydlufa. The assemblages in the kivas, participated in by all the prominent families, and the display of their fetishes indicate that while the main part of the SoydluVL is controlled by the Pdtki family, the ceremonials at the winter solstice are more complex than limita- tion to one family would imply. I can therefore believe that while the events in the Morkiva are essentially characteristic of</page><page sequence="10">Apr. 1898] WINTER SOLSTICE CEREMONY AT WALPI 109 the priesthood of the Pdtki clans, and primarily belong to their religious clan totemism, there are parts of them, such as the Eototo episode, which are intrusive. The Soydluna altar and the dance of the Kwataka and the Soydluia-maid, with the prayers to Pd- liilikos, and the sun-shield dramatization, are pure examples of the component which the Hopi ritual owes to the Pdtki clans, and on that account I have limited myself in this interpretation more especially to their consideration. The presence of Eototo and other katcinas was not, I believe, originally a part of the Soydluwa, but these personifications were later additions, due to contact of the Pdtki and other families. The decoration of the Soydluna-maid's face is also a secondary modification acquired since her cult came to Walpi. The per- sonation of this maid at Oraibi is more archaic than at East Mesa.

The worship of the Great Snake was undoubtedly introduced by the Pdtki clans, to which also may be ascribed the Kwakwant?i elements. The sun-worship is likewise of southern derivation. The klatcina ad- dition is believed to be a secondary increment. PA3 The Walpi Flute Observance: A Study of Primitive Dramatization, Journal of American Folk-Lore, Vol. vii, No. 21, 1894.
