<plain_text><page sequence="1">120 REVIEWS of various kinds had been made in small diggings in recent years. These earlier operations had uncovered several gable-roofed tombs of the Twenty-second Dynasty, two buildings of the time of Ramesses II, a chapel of Sethos I, in which a number of objects of considerable interest had been discovered, and the Embalming House of the Apis Bulls. It was hoped that further excavation in this area would reveal some connexion between these various buildings and their relation to the Temple of Ptah. In the course of two months' work the following discoveries were made: (a) The south-west corner of the great Enclosure wall of the Temple of Ptah. From a stela of Merenptah found by Labib Habachi in 1948 in the neighbouring chapel of Sethos I it appears that the wall was probably built by Merenptah. (b) The Sanctuary of Ramesses II just outside the south-west corner of the wall was found to be part of a larger temple, the area of which was encroached on by the building of the wall. In front of this Sanctuary is a colonnade, and the excavations revealed that this area was occupied by artisans' dwellings and work- shops after the Sanctuary fell into disuse. (c) In the same area, in the south-east corner of the Sanctuary, were found three modest tombs built of re-used limestone slabs (some of which bear scenes which are not discussed in this volume) and mud-brick. They are all to be dated probably to the Lae New Kingdom and, as intrusive in the brickwork of the temple, may be compared with similar late tombs found at Medinet Habu. The thre6 tombs, X, Y and Z, yielded few objects of interest apart from Z. This tomb contained the remains of an old woman and with the body were the surviving elements of a necklace, including eleven pendants, mostly of gold and silver, one of which was a solid gold statuette of Amfin and another a solid gold figure of a scorpion. (d) A small excavation was made to uncover the southern part o the gateway that originally formed the entrance to the Sanctuary of Ramesses II. The northern part had been previously uncovered in 1948. (e) Further clearance was undertaken in the area of the Embalming'House of the Apis Bulls. Very adequate accounts of all these operations are given in Mit Rahineh 1955. Anthes contributes an introduction (which contains a brief account of recent work in the area by Labib Habachi) and a chapter of summary and conclusions on the excavations in the main area of work. The architecture is described by Monsieur J. Jacquet who in a remarkably lucid manner makes clear, as far as is possible, the confused tangle of stone and brickwork uncovered at various levels. Dr. Henry Fischer studies the finds of tomb Z, the pottery, and the flints. Other objects are described by Dr. Hasan S. K. Bakry; they are mostly very modest. Dimick provides a chapter on the Embalming House of the Apis Bulls in which he suggests that the whole process of the mummification of the dead animals was carried out at Memphis and not at the Serapeum. The descriptions of all these operations are somewhat inhibited by the fact that the work of this first season raised many problems that can only be solved by further work. It is to be hoped that the report for the 1956 season will be published soon and that the expedition may be able to resume work on the site before long. A most useful by-product of the first season's work was a new map of the central area of Memphis which is published loose with this volume. It can also be obtained separately. The new survey of the ancient monu- ments was carried out by Dimick and he has included all standing monuments as they are at present. Those that have been removed or are reburied are not included. The map is on a sufficiently large scale to be really useful. Two small necessary corrections have been pointed out to me by Fischer. The caption of fig. IA should read 'Alabaster vessels from Tomb Z'. The direction 'Looking west' for pl. 14a is misleading; the feet of the body point towards the west. T. G. H. JAMES The Tomb of Tjanefer at Thebes. By KEITH C. SEELE. University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications, Vol. LXXXVI. Chicago, I959. Pp. x+Io, pls. 41. The tomb, the scenes of which are published in this volume, is one of the largest and most conspicuous on the upper slopes of Dra' Abu 'n Naga' (no. I58). It is well known to visitors to the Theban Necropolis and has received some mention by early writers. The scenes in the Court and the inner chambers are much damaged, but many interesting parts remain. Reference to the new edition of Porter and Moss, Topographical</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS I21 Bibliography, vol. I, pt. I, in which all the scenes are listed, shows how little has been published previously; one of the few well-known scenes is that of a harper, the upper part of which is now in Berlin. The Tomb of Tjanefer derives additional interest from the fact that it is mentioned in the records of the investigations into the tomb robberies of the Twentieth Dynasty as one of those tombs entered and robbed. For several reasons, therefore, its proper publication is long overdue. It is a pity that the present volume falls short of what we may now expect in a full-scale publication of a Theban tomb. Here, principally, we are given good drawings of all the scenes, executed in the first instance by Professor Seele himself. He has used the now well-known technique of drawing on photographs developed by the Chicago Expedition for its work in the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu and elsewhere. The final inking-in was carried out by L. J. Longley, a former artist on the staff of the Chicago Expedition. Knowledge of the scrupulous care that characterizes the Chicago method, enables us to assume that the plates give as true a record as possible of the scenes and inscriptions that survive. For practical purposes, however, there are two respects in which the plates could have been improved. In the first place there is the problem of the indication of damage to the wall. In the case of walls where great areas are damaged or lost entirely it would indeed be unnecessary and certainly unsightly to hatch on the plates all the damaged portions. The problem is, however, different in the case of inscriptions where the damage may be confined to single signs or small groups of signs. There are many places in the texts of the scenes reproduced in this volume where damage of this kind has occurred. To the student using the plates some small gaps might appear to be due to the inadvertent omission of a sign by the ancient draughtsman or the modern copyist; the former type of omission is not uncommon in ancient inscriptions. Thus, on pl. 12, lower register, 1. Io, we find Q ; are we to think that the ancient draughtsman has omitted the stroke here or that the stroke has been lost? In a place like this a little discreet hatching (if the sign is lost) or a sic (if it has been omitted in antiquity) would soon satisfy the student. It should always be remembered in reproducing texts and scenes by line-drawing that the chief purpose is not to offer a work of art to a discerning public but to provide a form of the original that can be used with profit by the student. To that end the student should be given every assistance to interpret the drawings; hatching can be of great use, provided it is not used indiscriminately; so can the occasional footnote. The plates of this volume are unencumbered with hatching and footnotes. These omissions are the more to be regretted in a publication in which the introductory text gives so little help to the reader to understand the plates. A second deficiency of the plates is the lack of indications of joins when the scenes on one plate continue the scenes on the preceding plate. The scenes of the south wall of the passage leading from the Broad Hall to the 'Shrine' are reproduced on pls. 30-33; there are no overlaps from plate to plate and no other indications of how they should join up. The problem is particularly acute between pl. 32 and pl. 33. The tomb of Tjanefer, like other tombs of the late New Kingdom at Thebes, is decorated with scenes that are religious in character throughout. There are no representations of the activities of daily life. In the Court the subjects represented include the presentation of the deceased to various deities and other ritual activities such as the funerary banquet and the playing of 'chess' by the deceased. Further ritual scenes occur in the Broad Hall and these include parts of the funeral and burial ceremonies. In the Long Passage occur divisions of the Book of Gates. Pictorially, therefore, the tomb lacks much of the interest found in many of the earlier private tombs at Thebes; but there are, nevertheless, many things to interest the student, particularly the student of ritual matters. Some assistance, however, should have been given to enable the student to discover what the tomb contains. Many of the scenes, being badly damaged, are hard to interpret. On some walls it is not easy to discover the order of the events portrayed and the connexion between isolated, damaged, scenes. There are no explanatory captions to the plates and the introduction contains no summary of the scenes. In the case of a well-preserved tomb it is always helpful to provide the student with an account of what is represented. In the case of a badly damaged tomb it is quite essential to do so. The reader is therefore recommended to study the full summary of scenes in Tomb 158 to be found in the new Porter and Moss, Topographical Bibliography, vol. I, pt. i. The introductory text contains a description of the tomb and an account of Tjanefer and his family. The description is in two parts, the first dealing with the location of the tomb and its history in ancient and B 8737 R</page><page sequence="3">122 REVIEWS modern times; the second, longer part is devoted to the architectural arrangement of the tomb. Architec- turally the tomb is interesting because it possesses the only surviving example at Thebes of a stone pylon at the entrance to the forecourt. This pylon gives the tomb, externally, an imposing appearance which is greatly enhanced by its lofty situation on the hillside. Similar stone pylons, as Seele suggests, undoubtedly occurred in other Theban tombs of the greater nobles. The tomb also possessed a tall brick pyramid, only the lower courses of which now survive. A representation of this pyramid occurs in one of the better-preserved scenes in the Broad Hall. In the section devoted to Tjanefer and his family Seele discusses in the first place the true status of the deceased and concludes that he probably was ultimately First Prophet of Amun, although he is given the title explicitly only once in the tomb. He is otherwise called Third Prophet of Amun or ej ed . Seele suggests that the stroke in the latter title may represent tpy. This suggestion seems sound, whether the stroke be taken as a variant writing of or as a cardinal number used with ordinal sense. There are other good reasons, given by Seele, to confirm that Tjanefer was First Prophet of Amun, not least among them being the size, position, and quality of his tomb. In an interesting discussion of the relations of Tjanefer and their interconnexions with the high-priestly families of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, Seele concludes that Tjanefer probably flourished in the period from the later years of Ramesses II to the earlier part of the reign of Ramesses III. He was certainly a member of the priestly clan that did so much to weaken royal authority in the late New Kingdom, but in view of the difficulty Seele has in establishing precisely that Tjanefer was High Priest and the exact period when he exercised that office, we should be cautious about agreeing with h it is final paragraph:'Perhaps it is not too much to say that Tjanefer contributed as much as any single individual to undermining the pharaonic authority and eventually, in consequence, to the collapse of the Ramessids, from which Egypt never fully recovered'. T. G. H. JAMES Earliest Intellectual Man's Idea of the Cosmos. By SAMUEL A. B. MERCER, London, 1957. Pp. iV+ 122. 25S. Professor Mercer here discusses ideas current in ancient Egypt and Sumero-Babylonia (a term defended by him in his preface) about the cosmos. After an introductory chapter he deals with the 'background' and proceeds to discuss-I quote some of the headings-the gods; kings and men; the sky, the earth, water, air, trees, plants, and grain; astronomy; creation; death and the future world; the underworld; and the cosmos. His last chapter deals with calendars and general comparisons. Each exposition is divided between the two regions, but the sections dealing with Sumero-Babylonian matters are noticeably shorter; this, we are told, is 'because the same thing is often true of both Egypt and Sumero-Babylonia'. Professor Mercer states that he has 'used a minimum of references in the text, trying to make up for it by a comparatively full bibliography at the end of the book'. This makes a reviewer's task difficult, for there are many statements which appear to be questionable. For instance, in a discussion of what the Egyptians believed the shape of the e earth to be, it is said (p. 77; cf. 64 f.) that 'the earth to the Egyptians was a disk, personified, and represented as an outstretched man'. The latter part of this statement clearly refers to the familiar depiction of Geb, as in Bonnet, Bilderatlas: Agyptische Religion, fig. 2. One should, therefore, say 'god' rather than 'man', even though the figure is anthropomorphic. But what is the evidence that Geb here personifies and represents the earth as a disk? If the statement intends to relate the participles to 'earth' rather than 'disk', the question remains whether the Egyptians ever thought of the earth as a disk. None of the relevant hieroglyphs appears to suggest this. It is true that a common expression in Egyptian for the earth (which Mercer does not refer to) is snnt itn, 'what the sun goes round'; cf. snnt nbt itn 'all that the sun goes round'.' The most frequent writing, however, of this verb according to the Worterbuch is Q , where the determinative is oval rather than circular. Further, even if the action involved the describing of a circle, it would not follow that the object encircled was regarded as of that shape; it is possible, for example, to encircle a square. The Egyptians may, of course, have imagined the movement of the sun round the earth to be in a course above and below a flat object, in a two-dimensional pattern. If so, the shape of I For the two expressions see Wb. Iv, 490.</page></plain_text>
