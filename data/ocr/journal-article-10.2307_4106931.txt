<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAUGHTER Roger Scruton and Peter Jones I-Roger Scruton 1. Man is the only animal that laughs, but it seems that laughter belongs also to the immortals. A starting point for all enquiries into laughter must therefore be the hypothesis that it is an attribute of reason (which is the quality that distinguishes men and gods from animals). That gets us no further than our definition of reason. If all we can say is that reason is the feature which distinguishes men and gods from the humourless animals, then it gets us nowhere. As a matter of fact, however, it has become clear in recent years that much can be said about the concept of the 'rational being'. Although analytical philosophy has yet to give a theory of rationality that has the grandeur and consequence of those of Aristotle, Aquinas or Kant, it can nevertheless make gestures which carry some promise of system. In this paper I shall make such a gesture, and hope that the intimation of a distant theory will compensate for the sketchiness of my account. It is evident that a theory of sensation that said nothing about the nature of sentient beings would not be a theory of sensation. It should be equally evident that no theory of laughter can dispense with an account of the being that laughs. It is not a misfortune of animals that they are so humourless. The cackle of the hyena would not be turned into laughter by a little more effort on his part. However hard he tries, the day will never come when that dismal sound is irradiated by the spirit of amusement. It is not that he should try harder at what he is doing, but that he should do something else. And this something else lies outside his nature. The discussion of animal mentality frequently brings to light these mental capacities that are 'outside nature'. It is this which compels us to recognize the vastness of the gap between the animals and ourselves. To possess reason is not to possess a further sense or'capacity': it is to be systematically different in kind. Reason permeates our nature, and transforms even our pains and pleasures into states that are peculiar to us.</page><page sequence="2">198 I-ROGER SCRUTON 2. 'Laughter' is a misleading term. We use it to refer to the sounds emitted by someone who is being tickled, to certain expressions of scorn or dismay, to the 'hollow laughter' that accompanies the perception of one's ruin. In this broad sense (in which it denotes a sound produced through the mouth of a sentient being) we even use the term of hyenas. Hence the preference among philosophers for less symptomatic labels: 'amusement', which denotes a state of mind, and 'humour', which denotes one of its objects. Neither of these terms is fully satisfactory: an amusing holiday, like an amusement arcade, may contain little humour, and no amusement. To feel our way towards the mental phenomenon that concerns us, we must recognize that common usage will be an inaccurate guide. The first step towards imposing order on this usage is to stipulate that the phenomenon which we seek to describe has intentionality. It is not laughter, but laughter at or about something, that interests the philosopher. Given intentionality, 'laughter', 'amusement' and 'humour' may designate a single state of mind. Laughter is its full expression, amusement its essence, and humour its intentional object. As we shall see, this is not quite right; but it serves to introduce the topic in a more or less orderly manner. 3. One familiar account of intentionality is in terms of thought. A state of mind is intentional if it contains, or is founded on (recourse to metaphor is difficult to avoid) a thought.' 'Thought' here means what Frege meant by 'Gedanke': the content of a declarative sentence; the bearer of a truth value. In certain cases this thought may be a belief. I am afraid of you because I believe that you intend me harm. But not all thoughts are beliefs; some are merely entertained, in whatever mode of imagination or suspended judgement. One explanation of the humourlessness of animals might be that amusement contains, or is founded on, a thought of which animals are incapable. Thoughts that involve self-consciousness are peculiar to rational beings (which is why animals are never sentimental); so too are thoughts that involve morality (which is why animals never feel remorse). And so on. I make this suggestion not in order to endorse it, but in order to suggest an easy way in which rationality and amusement might be brought</page><page sequence="3">LAUGHTER 199 into connection. It is not the way that I shall recommend. Is it true that all intentionality involves, and is explained by, thought? Unfortunately there seem to be intentional states that do not (in the sense intended) involve thoughts. The nearest a dog ever gets to laughing is, I suppose, barking. But we make the distinction between barking simpliciter (a useless activity which most human beings deplore), and barking at an intruder or a friend. Is this second not an example of intentionality? It certainly seems that reference to the object of a bark can require an intensional context; in which case barking satisfies the most favoured criterion of intentionality. If a dog barks at a cat, it does not follow either that there is an object at which he is barking (he might be barking up the wrong tree), or that, if there is one, it is, so to speak, as he 'barks' it to be (it may be a mechanical cat with jaws of invincible steel, and he was certainly no such fool as to bark at that). Thus things barked at need not obey Leibniz's law; nor can one always quantify into a bark. Confirmation of the 'intentional in-existence' of the barkee is to be found in George Eliot: The sincere antipathy of a dog towards cats in general, necessarily takes the form of indignant barking at the neighbour's black cat which makes daily trespass; the bark at imagined cats, though a frequent exercise of the canine mind, is yet comparatively feeble. (Felix Holt, ch. XV). Whatever we say about the case, however, it is clearly not likely to provide us with a model for amusement. In the same sense in which dogs bark at cats, we can imagine hyenas laughing at each other. But it is quite another thing to say that hyenas thereby express their amusement (although we may hear them as expressing ours). This must lend weight to the theory that amusement is an expression of thought. So is there any specific thought, characteristic of amusement as such? If so, we will be able to characterise the 'formal object' of laughter-the description under which anything must be thought to fall if it is to be laughed at. 4. The case for the formal object has been admirably set out by Michael Clark in an article which also offers a theory of amusement.2 Clark rightly criticizes those, like Schopenhauer</page><page sequence="4">200 I-ROGER SCRUTON and Bergson, who have tried to provide sufficient conditions for something's being funny, and to explain amusement as the perception that those conditions are fulfilled. If there is a place in the analysis of amusement for such a perception it is, Clark argues, as a necessary and not as a sufficient condition. That is to say, it may be necessary to perceive, think of, or imagine an object in a certain way in order to laugh at it: but one might well so conceive it and not laugh. Clark argues that the traditional theories are more acceptable if regarded as attempts to give the thought that is characteristic of amusement-the 'description under which' an object is laughed at-rather than the whole character of laughter. Clark rightly points out that the thought which characterizes amusement does not have to be a belief: I can be amused by what is merely imaginary. Following Schopenhauer, he pro- poses the 'incongruous' as the formal object of amusement, and argues that whenever I am amused, I must 'see' the object 'as' incongruous, in a manner that he tries to specify. That is not sufficient for amusement, but it is necessary. In order to be amused I must also enjoy this incongruity, the incongruity must be the cause of my enjoyment, and (I here paraphrase radically) I must enjoy the incongruity at least partlyfor its own sake. I shall return to these further observations later. 5. I wish first to examine the suggestion that the formal object of amusement is to be captured by the idea of 'incongruity'. Clark, following Munro3, distinguishes three common accounts of amusement: superiority theories (exemplified by Hobbes's view of laughter as 'sudden glory'), 'relief from restraint' theories (such as Freud's explanation of jokes), and 'incongruity' theories, of the kind given by Schopenhauer. He rejects the first two kinds-rightly I believe. For either they cover all examples of amusement by being made so vague as to be insignificant; or else they are given a precise meaning only to exclude many of the things at which we are prone to laugh. But why is the incongruity theory not open to a similar objection? Clark, inspired by Schopenhauer, explains incongruity as 'incongruous subsumption under a concept', which amounts to some kind of striking discrepancy between the object subsumed and the standard instances with which it is thereby brought into</page><page sequence="5">LAUGHTER 201 relation. Is it likely that such an idea could be made precise without also excluding central cases of amusement? In order to test the theory I shall return to Schopenhauer, and attempt to gloss the idea of 'incongruity' in terms which are not Clark's but which capture, I think, Clark's meaning. Schopenhauer explains incongruity thus: 'two or more real objects are thought through one concept, and the identity of the concept is transferred to the objects: it then becomes strikingly apparent from the entire difference of the objects in other respects, that the concept was only applicable to them from a one-sided point of view. It occurs just as often, however, that the incongruity between a single real object and the concept under which, from one point of view, it has been rightly subsumed, is suddenly felt. Now the more correct the subsumption of such objects from one point of view, and the greater and more glaring the incongruity with it from another point of view, the greater is the ludicrous effect which is produced by this contrast'.4 This is not the place to embark on an interpretation of Schopenhauer. However, the passage makes several suggestions about incongruity: for example, that it is revealed or understood through a conflict of points of view; that it lies, or can lie, in an incongruity between object and concept. Neither suggestion is clear. I suspect that the real incongruity of which Schopenhauer speaks lies not between object and concept but between points of view: the reference to concept and object being no more than an attempt to squeeze his analysis into the brave metaphysical system of which it is designed to form a part. There is an instance, however, that could be held to illustrate Schopenhauer's meaning: that of the mimic. Mimicry is amusing partly because of its successful presentation of two things in one-the mimic, and the person mimicked. The 'funny man' presents his victim at the same time as distorting him, with the odd result that one sees the victim in the distortion.5 You might say that this is like the simultaneous subsumption of an object under, and exclusion of that object from, a single concept. From one point of view the mimic's gestures fit the concept 'indolent man'. From another point of view (that which does not penetrate to the representa- tion), the subsumption is absurd, for the very exaggeration of the gestures denies it. But the language of 'concept and object' belongs to the</page><page sequence="6">202 I-ROGER SCRUTON metaphysical theory, and looks plausible only because of its vagueness. Consider a caricature of the Prime Minister: it may represent a non-deviant example of a woman, but still be a caricature of her. So what is the concept with which this instance is compared? Should we say: the concept of Mrs Thatcher? Should we refer, that is, to the Leibnizian 'individual notion' which she uniquely satisfies and from which the caricature, in however minute but significant a way, departs? It may seem so, since what is funny in a caricature is its simultaneous proximity to and deviation from an individual. But then the reference to 'concepts' is no more than a ruse. And when this reference is dropped, it is no longer clear that we have a case of incongruity. The caricature amuses, not because it does not fit Mrs Thatcher, but because it does fit her, all too well. It is true that it must also contain an exaggeration: but the exaggeration is amusing because it draws attention to some feature of her. If one wishes to describe the humour of a caricature in terms of incongruity it must be added that it is an incongruity which illustrates a deeper congruity between an object and itself. If that is vague, it is because the word 'incongruous' is vague. The point of the example was merely to draw attention to the general difficulty: either you make the concept precise, and then risk leaving out important cases of amusement. Or you leave it vague, and content yourself with a vacuous characterization of the formal object of laughter-vacuous because to know what is meant by the 'incongruous' you would have to consult, not some independent conception, but the range of objects at which we laugh. Further examples can be adduced to confirm that thought. Consider the action which is so much in character that we cannot but laugh. Wit may not be quite what Pope said it is-what oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed-but satire at least possesses, when successful, the quality of accuracy, and satire has its equivalent in everyday life, when a character acts true to himself. What amuses us, it could be said, is the total congruence between the idea of the man and his action. We might be enraged or hurt by it: but I do not see why we might not also be amused. It would be wrong to expand those observations into a 'congruity' theory of amusement. For that would be to risk just</page><page sequence="7">LAUGHTER 203 the same kind of censure that I have been expressing. Rather I wish to suggest that the problems with Clark's analysis stem, not from a faulty identification of the formal object of amusement, but from a misleading implication in the idea of a formal object. 6. I have taken for granted a certain understanding of the phrase 'formal object' -a medieval term of Aristotelian proven- ance, recently applied to the discussion of intentionality by Kenny.6 When describing states of mind we transfer the idea from the material to the intentional realm. The relation between emotion and object is-to use the misleading term- 'internal'. It is not a material relation. In the material sphere the idea of a formal object is not so hard to understand: only what is wet can be dried, only what is solid can be thrown, and so on. But you can try to dry what is not wet: 'trying to dry' designates an intentional relation, and its object is characterized by what Brentano called 'in-existence'. So too with emotions. If the formal object of fear is 'what is harmful', then this designation must be understood to qualify only the intentional object. It specifies a limitation not on the material object of fear, but on the thought through which the material object is presented. I can fear only what I think to be harmful. It has been argued that many emotions have formal objects, since they are identified in terms of the beliefs on which they are founded. For example, we distinguish jealousy from envy by referring to the belief, present in the first, but not in the second, that the subject is cheated by another's possession of some good. Some, Clark included, go on to construe the existence of the 'formal object' of emotion as a product of our classifications of states of mind.7 It is necessary to distinguish formal from proper objects. The formal object of fear (say) is given by the description under which something must be thought if it is to be feared: it is what can be feared. The proper object is not what can be feared, but rather what it is right, proper orjustified to fear. The 'harmful' is (perhaps) the formal object of fear; its proper object is the fearful. To justify the description 'fearful' is to justify fear. Confusion between formal and proper objects leads many- including Sartres-to consider emotions to be a kind of judgement. Fear then becomes the recognition of the fearful, anxiety the recognition of the angoissant, amusement the recog-</page><page sequence="8">204 I-ROGER SCRUTON nition of the amusing. It begins to seem as if nothing of the emotion remains, other than this act of (admittedly passionate) appraisal. The characteristic of a formal object is that someone may think something to be an instance of it, and yet feel no prompting towards the emotion which it partially characterizes. The formal object is given by a description which falls short of embodying the peculiar emotional characteristics which it serves to focus. The proper object is not so given. It is my belief that the temptation to build into the description of the formal object ideas that belong to the proper object is responsible for many fallacies in ethics, aesthetics and the philosophy of mind. In particular it seems to have precipitated renewed sympathy for the philosophy of 'moral realism', according to which the possession of values resides in an ability to recognize peculiar (and peculiarly elusive') features of reality. 7. Does amusement have a formal object? How do we settle the question? We could, I suppose, list all the possible candidates and attempt to find counter-examples. One pleasing candidate is offered by Bergson: the formal object of amusement is life overcome by mechanism, or mechanism perceived in the heart of life (a special case of the incongruity theory).'" This seems vulnerable at once to the counter-example of the character who amuses because he is true to himself. But perhaps there is some better method than that of listing proposals and then attempting to demolish them. If the formal object is a merely nominal feature, if it results only from our attempts to classify, then the question would hardly matter. We could arbitrarily designate amusement as that form of enjoyment which has the situation described by Bergson as its object, and use Le Rire as a kind of extension to our dictionary entry on 'laughter'. But the subject would hardly have aroused such interest if there were not some real basis to our classifications, and if the choice of a formal object were not restricted by some independent reality that we are attempting to describe. It is important to understand, in this connection, a peculiar feature of amusement, which serves to distinguish it from the common examples of emotion: it is a matter of indifference whether the object of amusement be thought to be real. Most of our emotions are founded not just on thoughts, but on beliefs.</page><page sequence="9">LAUGHTER 205 We may also suffer them in imagination; but the imagined version is a derived case, to be understood in terms of the real, active emotion of which it is the shadow. Consider jealousy. There is no doubt that jealousy has a formal object: in order to be jealous of Alfred I must believe Alfred to be a rival. (That is only one part of the full description of the formal object, but it will do.) Without that belief I may hate Alfred, despise him, or envy him; but I cannot be jealous of him. The formal object is given by this belief. I can also entertain the thought of 'Alfred as rival' in imagination; and I may then feel some imaginative simulacrum of jealousy. But it is quite clear that real jealousy and 'imagined' jealousy are different states of mind. The first is necessarily terrible; the second may be titillating, even pleasant. The first involves a definite stance towards the world, and a tyrannical invasion of experience; the second is sealed off in a private reserve of fantasy. In the case of amusement no such distinction between the real and the imagined can be sustained. If I laugh at someone's remark, and if I imagine the remark and laugh, then in each case my laughter has the same object, and expresses genuine amusement. Whether the object of my amusement be believed or imagined, my amusement remains the same; it has the same consequences, and the same place in my experience as a whole. Belief seems to be irrelevant. Or at least, what relevance it has is not that of distinguishing imagined amusement from the genuine article. I think that this 'indifference to belief' is an important feature, and explains our reluctance to describe amusement as an emotion. In the case of normal emotions the belief which identifies the formal object has an important role in determining the structure and significance of the feeling. For normal emotions are also motives to action. Jealousy seeks not just to interpret the world but to change it. Amusement may cause us to do things, but it is not itself a motive. (I do things for amusement, but notfrom amusement.) We classify emotions not arbitrarily but according to their role in the explanation of behaviour. As motives they are intermediaries between belief and action. Human nature being what it is, we have fixed expectations concerning the actions that will follow upon certain beliefs. Our classifications of emotions therefore stem</page><page sequence="10">206 I-ROGER SCRUTON from our perception (however indistinct) of real and recurrent causal relations between certain beliefs and the desires and projects which express, confirm and purge them. It is not merely a nominal matter that jealousy has the particular formal object that it has. It is a matter of the real essence of a state of mind active in the generation of human conduct, in which a belief is found locked in the heart of a perduring motive to action. The indifference of amusement to belief suggests that we should not expect it to exhibit the kind of structure that we observe in fear, anger and jealousy. Sometimes, it is true, belief plays a role in precipitating amusement: amusement (if it is indeed such) that expresses Schadenfreude arises only in response to a belief that one's rival, enemy, or thorn in the flesh has suffered injury. The mere thought of him doing so is never satisfactory. But we hesitate to call Schadenfreude amusement, and this suggests that my thesis is correct. Such examples could not possibly establish, either that a belief is necessary to normal amusement, or that any particular belief is always active in producing it. It is partly this that makes it so difficult to attribute a formal object to amusement: for we lack the motivational structure that is present in normal emotions, and hence can never feel confident that anything is explained by our identifi- cation of this or that predicate as the description under which an object must be laughed. We should therefore hesitate to elucidate the intentionality of amusement in terms of some single directing thought common to its instances. It may be that there is such a thought; but it is hard to say whether its designation is a merely nominal matter, or whether, on the contrary, there is some real (and explanatory) essence that is being picked out by means of it. 8. Nevertheless the intentionality of laughter is not like the intentionality of a bark. Amusement is a mode of thought. What mode of thought? It is noteworthy that the traditional theories were not theories of the formal object of laughter. They were, for the most part, attempts to specify its proper object (the ridiculous): that at which it is appropriate to laugh. Laughter and amusement were described in terms, not of some basic thought that is necessary to them, but in terms of the pattern of thought which renders the object ridiculous in the subject's eyes.</page><page sequence="11">LAUGHTER 207 This is fairly obvious in the passage quoted from Schopenhauer: it is also evident in Bergson. Perhaps there is no formal object of amusement. Perhaps there is no general study of the intentional object that stops short of saying when it is right to be amused. There is a trivial sense in which every intentional mental state has a formal object: only the believable can be believed, only the thinkable can be thought. And these empty tautologies may be given content by a theory of the 'understanding', such as was envisaged by Kant. The Critique ofPure Reason offers a disjunctive account of the thinkable (you can think X only if you think it under the categories). But if this is all we mean by referring to a formal object-i.e. the a priori conditions of the thinkable-then the assertion that amusement has a formal object is highly uninformative. We should, I think, recapture the motivation behind the traditional theories. We should look for a pattern or structure of thought characteristic of amusement, without concerning our- selves too much with the single necessary proposition in which all our laughter is based. It may be that there is such a proposition, but, since amusement is not an emotion, it is hard to say how we might discover it. When we seek the pattern of thought characteristic of laughter, two peculiar features impress themselves on us. The first is that, while everybody likes to laugh, nobody likes to be laughed at. The second is that a direct connection exists between amusement and the aesthetic point of view. The second feature is illustrated by the contrast between comedy and tragedy. There is no difficulty in explaining why we laugh in the theatre: any theory of humour is also a theory of comedy. Aesthetic representations are as much objects of amusement as anything else, and amusement enters into the enjoyment of comedy without doing any violence to the aesthetic point of view. Tragedy, by contrast, creates a notorious problem for the philosophy of aesthetic interest. Why do we enjoy the representation of suffering? There seems to be no normal ('extra-dramatic') state of mind of which tragic feeling is a species: we do not feel grief, dismay or horror in the theatre (else why should we go there?). The experience of tragedy is, or seems to be, sui generis; some mysterious alchemy is at work in accommodating the representation of terrible things to the aesthetic point of view from which they become enjoyable.</page><page sequence="12">208 I-ROGER SCRUTON Hence philosophers have felt obliged to give some special account of tragedy, in order to explain the transformation effected by the stage. Comedy, however, has never seemed problematic in quite that way. I wish to comment on these two features and suggest a theory of amusement that will explain them. 9. To be amused by someone is not the same as to be amused at him; while the first is gratifying to its object, the second is not. Why is that? Here we should reflect on the peculiar importance of the human among the objects of amusement. One can be amused at animals, and even at inanimate things (for example, mechanical dolls). But there is a temptation to think that these kinds of amusement are anthropomorphic. One sees the object in human terms, either as a human being, or as the expression of human thought and action. (Thus there are amusing buildings, but not, I think, amusing rocks and cliffs, even though many rocks and cliffs are quite bizarre.) If I were to propose a candidate for the formal object of amusement then the human (in its widest significance) would be my choice. But I am certain that I should be quickly forced to withdraw the suggestion, and to content myself merely with emphasizing the importance of the human, its centrality, among the objects of laughter, and perhaps hazarding the guess that someone who could be amused at nothing human could be amused at nothing. If people dislike being laughed at it is surely because laughter de-values its object in the subject's eyes. This de-valuing may be much needed and it may even be desired by the object. It is difficult to love a great man with the warmth that characterizes normal human relations. In order to do so, it may be necessary to find in him that which can be (however gently) laughed at. A truly great spirit will no doubt be willing to exchange the absolute security of the unlaughable for the comfort of human affection. Else, like Christ, he must think of himself as divine, in order to bear his inner isolation. Without the mitigation of friendship it is painful to be the object of laughter. It is possible not to be afflicted only by feeling such contempt (or pity) for those who laugh as to count it a virtue to be de-valued in their eyes (cf. Christ's attitude to those who mocked him). 'Laughing at' has many modes. Absolute mockery and</page><page sequence="13">LAUGHTER 209 reviling scarcely constitute amusement. Here every merit is stripped from the victim in the subject's eyes, and the laughter has that quality of malice which can be heard or overheard only with revulsion. Sarcasm likewise de-values and rejects in an unkind way, and again we feel that this 'unkindness' distances it from the normal cases of laughter. But sarcasm must be distinguished from irony. Irony de-values without rejecting: it is, in that sense, 'kind'. For example, Joyce's ironic comparison of Bloom with the wily Odysseus de-values the former only to insert him more fully into our affections. His shortcomings are part of his pathos, since they reflect a condition that is also ours. Irony of this kind causes us to laugh at its object only by laughing at ourselves. It thus forces upon us a perception of our kinship. Flaubert called it 'l'ironie qui n'enlkve rien au pathetique'; it is the laughter between familiars, without which no domestic affection could arise. In referring to a process of 'de-valuing' that is integral to laughter I have spoken very imprecisely. But I am not sure how to remedy the defect. 'De-valuing', however it is to be analysed, seems to be neither a precondition of amusement nor the result of it. It is, rather, the amusement itself. It is difficult to encapsulate it in the form of a judgement or thought which might have existed without the disposition to laughter. This 'pattern' of thought is constitutive of laughter. Amusement may thus be described as a kind of 'attentive demolition'. It is no accident that this pattern of thought should be enjoyable to us, since it reconciles us to our own condition. The connection between attentive demolition and enjoyment is real. The conjunction of the two in the definition of amusement is not the arbitrary specification of a nominal essence, but an attempt to isolate the causal process which structures a part of our mental life. 10. It is open to the defender of the formal object to find some way of translating my 'pattern' of thought--attentive demoli- tion-into a specific proposition entertained about its object. If that could be done, then I concede that amusement has been provided with its formal object. But I am sceptical. For I am impressed by the complexity of this 'attentive demolition', which resides in no single thought, and which feeds insatiably on</page><page sequence="14">210 I-ROGER SCRUTON everything that serves to approximate the condition of its object to our own. What matters, in any case, is the peculiar complexity of the thought that underlies amusement, and its distance from the thoughts which focus our emotions. There is no 'discovery' at the heart of amusement. Amusement is, rather, a mode of reflection, which presents its object in a certain light. It might now be thought that I have committed myself to the traditional 'superiority' theory mentioned earlier. But my remarks about irony were intended to deny that charge. To lower the object is not necessarily to raise the subject; it might be to lower both together. It is by the universal lowering that one may come to feel 'kinship' with the thing at which one laughs. The mistake, of 'superiority' and 'release' theories alike, is to find the meaning of humour in what it does for the subject, rather than in how it represents the object. Humour is not, normally, self-directed. Indeed one of its values lies in the fact that it directs our attention unceasingly outwards. If we are repelled by the humourless person it is often because we think of him as interested only in himself. 11. I turn now to the second feature of amusement: its ready subsumption under the aesthetic point of view. We laugh at real scenes, and at their dramatic representation, but there seems to be no transformation in the nature or quality of amusement as we proceed from life to art. Whether we are interested in an amusing episode, in the recital of it, or in its theatrical representation, we laugh always at the same thing and for the same reason. If the last is an example of aesthetic pleasure, then so is the first. Conversely, if amusement at real situations is not aesthetic pleasure, then laughter in the theatre ought not to be so either: in which case, there would be a problem of comedy after all. We should have to explain just how and why amusement is transfigured in the contemplation of imaginary scenes, and how it becomes part of an aesthetic interest in what is observed. It seems to me that it is most plausible to say that amusement is a kind of aesthetic interest-or at least, that it belongs to the genus of which aesthetic interest is a species. This is suggested by the thought (which I attributed to Clark, although the words are</page><page sequence="15">LAUGHTER 211 not his) that amusement is a mode of enjoying an object 'for its own sake'. My suggestion can be formulated in four propositions: (1) Amusement is a mode of reflective attention to an object. (2) It does not have the purpose of discovery (it does not concern itself with the acquisition of new beliefs, or the verification of old ones). (3) It is not a motive to action (it does not regard its object as the focus of any project or desire). (4) Enjoyment is to be explained by the thought of the object, and it is not felt (as Clark puts it) 'for some ulterior reason'. It is, I believe, one of the major tasks of aesthetics to make that last proposition clear. We know that there is a difference between the laugh of triumph, which enjoys the sight of another's misfortune because of what it seeks in it, and the laugh of amusement, which takes pleasure simply in what it sees, and for 'no other reason'. But it is hard to say anything systematic about the contrast." But the task is a general one for aesthetics. To the extent that amusement satisfies the four conditions, to that extent is it already a mode of aesthetic interest. For the conditions are precisely those which must be invoked in order to elucidate that peculiar kind of 'disinterest' that has-since Baumgarten-been called 'aesthetic'. 12. The argument has touched on a subject that lies beyond its scope. So I shall end with a suggestion that returns us to the opening remarks of this paper. It is only rational beings who can be attentive without a motive; only rational beings who can be interested in that in which they have no interest. Whatever explains that fact explains why only rational beings have aesthetic pleasures, and why only rational beings are moral. I shall offer no theory. But it remains to point out that the humourlessness of animals is of a piece with their incorrigible lack of taste, and with their deplorable indifference to questions of morality.</page><page sequence="16">212 I-ROGER SCRUTON NOTES 'See, for example, Richard Wollheim: 'Thought and Passion', P.A.S. 1967-8. 2Michael Clark: 'Humour and Incongruity', Philosophy 1970. 3D.

With a proper warning that everyday language may not be a reliable guide to philosophical insight, Scruton suggests that we concentrate on the phenomena he designates 'amuse- ment'. I shall follow that recommendation, although the wealth of terms and phrases available to us should not be forgotten. Humour in general, and laughter in particular, is frequently found offensive; it is then taken as indicative of insolence, impudence, cheek, presumption, audacity, impertinence, dis- respect, disdain or contempt. The imputation of notions such as these is that a contrary stance has been detected and found objectionable. What is of importance, significance, note, moment, weight, value, worth must surely be treated in a serious, solemn, sober, earnest manner, since it is no laughing matter; the trouble is that such a manner may be stodgy, stuffy, tedious, tiresome and boring. Typically, wit is described as sharp, keen, pointed, but it easily becomes biting, scathing, or openly malicious; by contrast, gentle humour is benign, lenient, mild, restrained, even uncritical, but it easily becomes blunted and dull when the sting is drawn. What follows from all this will become clear later. Bergson incorporated into his own subtle and allpsive discussion of the humorous three important conclusions established by his predecessors. Firstly, humour involves thought about something. Secondly, the propriety of humour can be established only by appeal to a real or imagined fraternity which is capable of thinking of the phenomena in similar ways. Thirdly, both the creation and appreciation of the humorous involve celebrating ideas for their own sake, after the manner in which we can regard works of art. A further point concerned the fact that humour presupposes value systems,</page><page sequence="18">214 II--PETER JONES which themselves are frequently the product of broader meta- physical views about, for example, the nature of reality or man's place in things. In brief, to find something amusing entails thinking of it under certain restricted descriptions, because what is amusing is discernible only from certain viewpoints, to people with specific knowledge, beliefs or values. On the basis of these views Bergson then develops his thesis that inflexibility is characteristic of the humorous.' Scruton, in his paper, suggests that amusement differs from common examples of emotion in such an important feature that it might disqualify amusement from being an emotion at all. That feature is its indifference to belief. My amusement, in other words, is unaffected by my believing or merely imagining the existence of its objects; consequently, it cannot function as a motive to action. Because of this, it is unclear whether anything is explained by reference to the intentional object of laughter; and that doubt is a reason for the further doubt that we can clearly distinguish the formal from the proper object of amusement. Scruton suggests that traditional theorists, aware of these problems, were perhaps right to concentrate on analysing the structure of thought characteristic of amusement, even if they also sometimes, and unwisely, attempted to specify neces- sary and sufficient conditions for it. Two elements in those traditional discussions merit special attention, in his view: the fact that although everyone likes to laugh, no one likes to be laughed at; and recognition that there is an intimate link between amusement and the aesthetic point of view. We laugh equally at real events and at the dramatic representation of them, and in both cases aesthetic pleasure seems to be involved. Scruton distinguishes four features of amusement, all of which point to an overlap if not an identity with aesthetic disin- terestedness. Amusement, he says, (1) is a mode of reflective attention to an object; (2) does not have the purpose of discovery; (3) is not a motive to action; (4) is to be explained by the thought of the object. In this sense, amusement is a mode of enjoying an object 'for its own sake'. In addition, and this is crucial, amusement should be seen as a kind of 'attentive demolition' which, as it were, is enjoyable because it both directs our attention outwards, away from ourselves, and also recon- ciles us to our condition.</page><page sequence="19">LAUGHTER 215 Although there is an important distinction between the intentionally and the unintentionally amusing, the former approximating to the art form of comedy, in both cases responses can be assessed for their appropriateness. In order to throw some light on that notion and some of its associates, such as the objectivity and disinterestedness of our thoughts or judgments in the context, I shall begin by discussing Hume's essay 'Of the Standard of Taste'.2 Hume is rather careful, I think, not to commit himself on which utterances character- istically constitute or express what he would deem to be judgments of taste; he is certainly concerned with how people respond to works of art, and that includes how they think of them, estimate them, and feel about them. Moreover, by looking at Hume's position we shall be able to see what might be involved in taking an aesthetic interest in something, and also whether amusement can properly be treated as a mode of such interest. By substituting the term 'amusement' for 'taste', in Hume's discussion, we shall be able to see how close the conclusions about each notion should be. The first aim of his essay, Hume tells us, is to search for "a rule, by which the various sentiments of men may be reconciled". One can talk of a reasonable dispute only so far as it can be "decided" by appeal to "a standard", and in the context of taste one problem is to determine whether a "criterion" can, or need, be found "in sentiment" (G.I.268, 279, 281). One remark about Hume's terminology can be made here, since it may serve to dispel any inclination to exclude thought from our analysis of amusement. The ambiguity in the French term sentiment, deplored by French and English writers alike from the late seventeenth century onwards, is precisely mirrored in Hume's own term 'sentiment', by which he sometimes means a sensation, passion, or emotion, and sometimes a judgment, opinion or belief; indeed, the term covers both feeling and thought, which notions he had previously tried to keep apart. This fact should be remembered when we read his conclusion in the essay on taste that "the difference . . betweenjudgment and sentiment" is not as wide as commonly supposed, since each must contribute to any proper judgment, verdict, or sentiment (terms used with equal promiscuity in this context). Hume needs to "restrain" acceptance of the proverb that it is "fruitless to dispute</page><page sequence="20">216 II-PETER JONES concerning tastes" (G.I.269) because that view ultimately threatens to undermine not only his account of moral judgment, but also his central epistemological position. Hume begins by observing that although everyone approves of justice, no one agrees which acts are just. It would be a mistake however to think that Hume is here concerned with problems of casuistry. Rather, his point is to emphasise that the evaluative and prescriptive dimensions of certain general terms mask wide disagreement over the particular cases they cover. Social beings, he maintained, share a natural interest in whatever is found pleasurable. Moreover, if communal pleasure in certain things is a necessary, although not a sufficient, condition of harmony and progress in society, the social utility of shared critical judgments becomes clear. So Hume's first task is to establish the conditions of proper judgment. He lists three main causes of failure to feel 'the proper sentiment', and in each case he follows the French source of his essay; failure is due to lack of delicacy, lack of good sense, and prejudice, and to overcome or forestall these factors it is necessary to engage in comparison and practice. The necessary conditions for dis- cerning the qualities in objects which will give rise to the proper sentiments are "a perfect serenity of mind, a recollection of thought, a due attention to the object" (G.I.271). The "good sense" which guards against prejudice is explicitly an activity of thought, as it had been for all the writers in France and Britain who used the notion, and its task is to consider the proper "point of view" from which each particular work of art "must be surveyed". In the case of literature, such thought specifically considers the ends or purposes for which a work has been calculated, the effectiveness of the means to those ends, the relations of the parts to the whole, and the intelligibility of the whole (G.I.276-8). The central role played by thought or judgment in Hume's account is already clear, and only the apparent hesitation is surprising in his remark that "in this respect, as well as many others, reason, if not an essential part of taste, is at least requisite". One other factor should be noticed. In the case of art, as in moral and everyday cases of perception, "the first perusal of any piece" is unreliable; we must not only examine a work more than once, but it must "be surveyed in different lights with attention and deliberation" (G.I.275). But</page><page sequence="21">LAUGHTER 217 even that is not enough. Although Hume is concerned to establish the conditions of appropriateness in our reactions to art, it may be claimed that he is greatly exaggerating the role of thought, and that even if he were right, any analogy between taste and amusement has disappeared; for is not the element of unthinking immediacy characteristic of amusement? An answer to that objection is best provided by pursuing Hume's thought somewhat further. In the Treatise Hume argued that because "our situation, with regard both to persons and things, is in continual fluctuation", and because "every particular man has a peculiar position with regard to others", it is necessary, in order "to arrive at a more stable judgement of things", to "fix on some steady and general points of view". In our "general judgment" we must "over-look our own interests", and place ourselves "in our thoughts" in the general point of view (T.581-2).' In matters of taste, similarly, I must consider "myself as a man in general" and "forget, if possible, my individual being and peculiar circumstances" (G.I.276). This presupposes not only that a man is able to detect, and then discount, precisely what is peculiar to his situation and attitude, but also that a necessary condition of properly reacting to objects is thinking of them in agreed and shareable ways. "An infinite confusion in human society" would result if'men acted only on "particular judgments"; "the intercourse of sentiments, therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form some general inalterable standard, by which we may approve of characters and manners" (T.532, 603). Hume adds that our heart may sometimes not endorse these general judgments. In the essay on taste, Hume's proper, appropriate, or justifiable sentiment is not merely a pleasurable but otherwise indeterminable feeling. Rather, it is a complex response to something attended to in specifiable ways; the attention is or can be consciously controlled, and the required causal relations exist only between objects with certain dispositional properties and minds which think of those objects in restricted ways. The pleasures, if any are detectable, are tied to the beliefs and attitudes which constitute the viewpoint necessary for that causal interaction; and a critic's task includes the articulation of the viewpoint, as a means to bringing others to perceive, and thus to derive pleasure from, the work in his way. Since Hume</page><page sequence="22">218 II-PETER JONES held that cause and effect are uniquely tied in every case, there could be no question of the proper response resulting from different conditions, unless, in a particular case, a restricted range of similar responses is counted as equally appropriate. And because repeated experience is typically required to establish the truth of causal claims, it will take time to establish the proper viewpoints--understood metaphorically, as the proper beliefs and attitudes; and that is one reason behind the appeal, common in the eighteenth century, to the longevity of a work's reputation. Every verdict reflects a viewpoint, and different verdicts reflect different viewpoints; agreed verdicts, above all, require agreed viewpoints. Hume acknowledges, of course, that works of art are in fact taken in different ways, but he puts that down to the influence of prejudice, and he identifies the correct way as the one which is agreed. But by whom, and when? Hume may be right to assume that a work which is admired over a period of time must have escaped the malign influence of contemporary prejudice, but he never raises the question of whether long admired works are, in fact or of necessity, understood in the same ways at different times, or whether some works admit of significantly varying interpre- tations. More important for our purposes, however, is the question whether someone could not derive greater pleasure from a situation he does not understand in the agreed ways, or from works judged inferior by those "qualified" to say. Hume accepts but does not argue for a distinction between the quantity and quality of pleasure, and he is tempted to claim that whatever pleases immediately must be superficial. But he is uneasy about wholesale surrender to the alleged experts, and his anxiety reveals itself in an important question: how, in matters of taste, can one detect the pretender? Pretenders to revelation had been a longstanding problem for theologians, of course, and the issue arose whenever authority was claimed for private states. Hume has already set aside "the bad critic" who always insists "upon his particular sentiment", but he now raises the issues of deception and personal response. In all "disputable questions", he claims, we "must acknowledge a true and decisive standard to exist somewhere", and in every disputed case everyone must "produce the best arguments ... invention suggests" (G.I.279). In any given case, however, we</page><page sequence="23">LAUGHTER 219 may be ignorant of the relevant standard, or reject the standard judgments, and in neither event would it bejustifiable to impute pretence. Hume in fact drops the matter almost as quickly as he raised it, with the bland assertion that the best chaps, like the best works, float to the top. But he suddenly makes another move, and that, too, is instructive in our implicit comparison between taste and amusement. Diverse judgments may stem, Hume suggests, not only from avoidable prejudices but from personal quirks or from peculiar features of the social context; furthermore, personal preferences, as such, cannot be matters for fruitful discussion precisely because no standard can be appealed to. Hume claims that we learn how to praise and blame by implicit comparison of a given case with the best of its kind known to us, and that this will be a public, corporate effort, influenced by the procedures and traditions of the community. For much of his essay Hume has been concerned with the conditions for determining what a particular work is; traces of admirable qualities need trained perception, and merit according to species calls for comparative judgment. The overall merit of a work, however, stands or falls on an estimate of its moral stance, if there is one: this is a test for which Hume has not prepared us. It is possible and excusable to derive pleasure from works which express speculative opinions we disagree with; it is possible, but inexcusable, to derive pleasure from works which celebrate deviant moral views. Thought must be involved in grasping the moral content, of course, just as in determining the proper viewpoint, and in comparing the work with those of a like kind. The moral estimate of a work, however, is not made from 'the proper viewpoint', but from a standpoint essentially outside the work. The danger now is that 'the proper sentiment' can be taken to cover both judgments about the nature of the work, together with verdicts on its comparative merit typified by remarks such as 'The work is good of its kind'; and also moral estimates of the work, as judged by reference to the 'true' moral standards. Similarly, 'the standard of taste' can cover both the models against which particular works are measured, and, once again, the moral standards; confusingly, Hume sometimes almost conflates the notion with that of the conditions for determining what the work is. Aside from all this, Hume insists that</page><page sequence="24">220 II-PETER JONES expressions of personal likes and dislikes, if they amount to no more than that, are not open to rational discussion; although, to the extent that they imply some conception of what the work is, they are, perhaps, morally assessable. Hume never abandons his unargued assumption that people have feelings, and that similarly constituted and influenced people have similar feelings; it is significant, however, that in the essay on taste there is almost no discussion of inner experience, and the emphasis is firmly on the necessary public dimension of critical judgments. In his early attempts to discern the influence of thought and feeling over the minds and affairs of men, Hume is often in danger of leaving nothing to thought; by the time of his essay on taste he encounters the opposite danger, and 'proper sentiment' becomes synonymous with 'proper judgment'. One other feature of his position should be mentioned. Hume's appeal to qualified judges has often been criticised as circular, but I believe that criticism to be misdirected. Hume can maintain that when practices are already going concerns, we learn who the acknowledged experts are whilst learning those practices ourselves; what he does not discuss is how the first experts in a given field gain recognition, and how established judgments are modified or, exceptionally, overturned. He cannot appeal to the passing of time since, by itself, time does nothing to establish either the correctness or appropriateness of a judgment, and reference to the future can hardly function as a criterion in the present. We now have a convenient set of co-ordinates for plotting the position of amusement in relation to Hume's remarks on taste. We can readily concede that human beings are social, and do share an interest in whatever is found pleasurable; in addition, the evaluative and (possibly) prescriptive aspects of the language typically expressive of amusement may disguise wide disagree- ment over which situations are amusing or, indeed, over what it is to be amusing. Moreover, due attention to the object, involving the undistracted perception of its structure, must be a necessary condition for what I shall call, barbarously, 'a proper judgment of amusement'. I must set aside the objection that these concessions are worthless unless we have a fuller analysis of each constituent notion, in favour of the claim that Hume's next tenet does not apply to amusement. His view is that "the first</page><page sequence="25">LAUGHTER 221 perusal of any piece" is characteristically unreliable as a guide to the 'proper sentiment'. Surely, for some types of situation which cause amusement, and are thus described as amusing, the initial response is all that can be asked for. Furthermore, to the extent that the twin elements of surprise and incongruity contribute to our amusement, as many writers have suggested, are we not decreasingly amused by the repetition that renewed perusal requires? The same slapstick routine is rarely amusing on second sight, and jokes and cartoons which reward it do so only because they transcend a local context, or are conspicuously well made; these last can certainly be cherished over a period of time, but initial laughter normally gives way to a more contemplative pleasure, augmented by the quite different pleasure, sometimes, of being able to tell others and elicit their laughter. The apparent 'click' with which we suddenly see something as amusing does not necessarily accompany our first encounter with it; just as we can come to see the beauty of a thing, so we can come to see the funny side of it, and in neither case need the preparation diminish the intensity or extent of our pleasure. There is no reason to take slapstick, or topical jokes, as representative of amusement in general, anymore than there is to take The Mousetrap, despite its longevity, as representative of the kind of work to which Hume's analysis properly applies. The gestures, puns, jokes, cartoons which strive for immediate effect have to be relatively simple in order to achieve it; moreover, they stand alone, as it were, supported by no more than a general background of suppositions about the likely range of the audience's beliefs, interests, responses. By contrast, novelists or playwrights are able to control the contexts for their amusing situations; devotees of the Marx brothers, for example, are as likely to describe a whole scene as any line which may constitute its climax. Almost all the general observations made so far have been confined to art forms, or what might be taken to approximate to them-plays, jokes, puns, cartoons; in other words, to human products created for the purposes of amusement. Three caveats should be issued, therefore. Firstly, a limited range of examples may suggest a closer analogy between amusement and aesthetic interest than can be sustained by more careful analysis; secondly, it may be just their status as art forms which suggests</page><page sequence="26">222 II-PETER .JONES the analogy, and not whatever it is that makes them amusing; thirdly, and above all, no analysis of amusement has yet been attempted. An explanation of amusement in terms of perceiving in- congruity is vague because the notion of incongruity is vague, as Scruton says. But although he makes no reference to it in his own 'four propositions', Scruton is properly attracted to it. If incongruity is a relation of, say, mismatch or conflict between points of view, we need to know why only some such conflicts are a source of amusement. Moreover, the perception or belief that there is incongruity or mismatch presupposes some notion of congruity or match; but if emphasis is placed on the pre- supposition it is hard to avoid an implication of moraljudgment in seeing the incongruity as error. Aristotle suggested that what pleases us in cases of contrived incongruity, that is, in art forms, is the aptness in the incongruity; but attention to cases of this kind, when our intellectual blinkers are removed, weakens the justification for selecting incongruity as the focus of our amusement. Indeed, the error here lies not in the presentation, but in our own presupposition; and if our pleasure derives from the aptness of the presentation, it is hard to see what remains of our mistaken former beliefs. It may be objected, however, that we are making amusement too much an intellectual response, and that epistemic and moral issues are bound to arise as soon as emphasis is placed on appropriateness and inappropriateness. What replies can be made to these remarks? D. H. Monro4 attempted a partial classification of the things we laugh at, and on his list there occur the following phenomena: breaches of the usual order of events, including eccentric appearance and behaviour; indecency; 'universe-changing', or importing into one situation what belongs to another; anything masquerading as something it is not, as in mimicry; word-play, including puns; nonsense, including the kind popularised by Lewis Carroll; want of skill, as when we laugh at incompetence. Reflection on this list encourages Monro to contend that the laughable is a species of the inappropriate, but in which an element of appropriateness is also discernible. That qualifi- cation seems to disqualify some of his listed phenomena, however; one may well ask what appropriateness can be found in incompetence, for example, or even in nonsense. This aside, it</page><page sequence="27">LAUGHTER 223 is clear that a necessary condition of laughing on any of the occasions Monro classifies is thinking of the situation in certain ways; in addition, certain moods are palpably inimical to laughter, as actors and comedians know well. Many of our responses to situations are conventional, and learning to respond to them as others do involves learning how they think of them. Here, we can re-introduce Hume's question about pretending. In matters of taste Hume's pretender seemed to be someone who claimed to feel what he did not feel, or to perceive what was not perceptible, or to perceive what he could not himself perceive; and among the motives for such deception might be a desire to be thought, on the one hand, normal and like everyone else, or on the other hand, peculiarly perceptive. If others come to accept the pretender's remarks as just, they would have no grounds, so far, for suspecting pretence; moreover, their endorsement of his remarks might diminish his own self-doubt (although it could arouse his contempt). What would it be to pretend to be amused? Although laughter is a general characteristic of amusement, along with other be- haviour such as smiling, it can be simulated, and actors can be taught to make the sounds of spontaneous laughter, just as evangelists can be taught to look suitably cheerful and politicians suitably glum (or 'loving' and 'statesmanlike', respectively). To be judged humourless is to be judged unresponsive to what others find amusing; to remain unamused, for example, by what they deem to be incongruous, nonsense, and so on. In a well- known passage Hume remarks that if we read the works of Palladio and Perrault we shall find descriptions of architectural elements, but not of their beauty, as such. He adds that "they would readily reply, that the beauty is not in any of the parts or members of a pillar, but results from the whole, when that complicated figure is presented to an intelligent mind, susceptible to those finer sensations . . . from his sentiments alone arise its elegance and beauty".5 Seeing the beauty here is partly a matter of deriving pleasure from perceiving the phenomena under determinable descriptions; the evidence that someone does so perceive them normally consists in the ability to describe other phenomena in ways acceptable to the peer group. This skill, however, does not entail that pleasure is felt. Similarly, someone might not only follow descriptions in terms of incongruity or</page><page sequence="28">224 II-PETER JONES nonsense, but offer his own analogous descriptions, and yet not be amused in the sense that he does not enjoy thinking of things in that way. Perhaps some people described as 'sardonic' and 'droll' come into this category, for although they are sometimes themselves the object of laughter, their own perceptions of other things are often found amusing. There seem to be two main reasons why someone remains unamused, at least if Hume's reflections on beauty are accepted as a fruitful analogy. Firstly, our agelast may have an abnormal 'constitution', in Hume's words, similar to the physical defects from which the colour- blind suffer; secondly, and more interestingly, the agelast, despite appearances, has simply not adopted the proper point of view necessary for amusement. That suggestion requires elabor- ation. Since the eighteenth-century aesthetic interest in an object has been sharply separated from practical interest which leads to action. There is no reason to exclude knowledge from the aesthetic; rather, aesthetic interest can be characterised as the reflective or contemplative attention which survives or super- sedes inquiry-knowing what is to be known, or what we wanted to know, do we still attend to the object? Hume was one of the first thinkers to recognise that the effect a work of art produces depends not only on the work's properties, but on the responder's own nature, and the traditions and conventions for approaching works of the kind in question. The proper point of view is 'proper' in the sense that it is necessary for perception of the real properties of the work which cause our pleasure; it is called for by the work, and to a degree intended by the work's creator; and without it one cannot know what the work is. But works typically have content as well as form and, as we have seen, a merely contemplative attitude towards some content is morally reprehensible in Hume's view. A 'proper' response attendant upon the 'proper' viewpoint, therefore, might be one of repudiation. It is a moral tenet, of course, that aesthetic matters ought to be ultimately subordinated to moral principles. Here, we can take a further step. When laughter is deemed inappropriate, as schoolchildren quickly learn, a demand is usually made for explanation and justification: 'What are you laughing at? What is funny about that?' To snigger, giggle, titter or even smirk during a Latin</page><page sequence="29">LAUGHTER 225 lesson, Marxist meeting or psycho-analysis, would generally be deemed inappropriate, but not principally because such a response might be infectious; rather, laughter is found threaten- ing by those who either fail to grasp, or repudiate, the viewpoint assumed. In the cases cited laughter would be taken as subversive and belittling. The point is inadequately marked by distinguishing those who do not take things seriously, from those who take them only too seriously. The crucial notions are those of 'belittling' and 'detachment'. Fanatics, by definition, are single-minded, reluctant to contemplate alternative possibilities, hostile to opposition, and rarely beset by self-doubt; scepticism is not their hall-mark. Almost everything is sacrificed in the pursuit of the goals, and in this sense a fanatic's interests are intensely practical. Even when they are not egotists, it is no accident that fanatics are characteristically humourless, because wholesale commitment to a course of action naturally excludes any third-person viewpoint which might inhibit action and, worse, engender scepticism about the whole enterprise. The inflexibility of a fanatic can amuse others, of course, when viewed from certain positions, but those viewpoints must exclude moral consider- ation of his actions. Is laughter resented by its victim, then, because the agent sees his moral stance as discounted; or because the viewpoint implied in laughter represents a rival moral stance? Although there are many activities that can be pursued with pleasure, there are few that can be performed laughingly; and most of them are already associated with play. To be engaged in an activity is to be pursuing a goal, sometimes with concentration and energy, sometimes also with pleasure; if our attention is arrested by a thought that what we are doing is, say, pointless, or incompetent, or ill-adapted to our goal, we are likely to be discomfited and our resolve may weaken. Laughter is often and rightly taken as the herald to such thoughts. The victim of laughter is confronted by the reaction of a mere spectator; someone, usually, whose energies are not already directed towards the agent's goal, whose personal investment, so to say, is not at stake. Laughter is detached in the sense that it typically requires a spectator's viewpoint; and a man can laugh at himself only when he is able to adopt that relatively sophisticated viewpoint of himself. Moreover, to the extent that</page><page sequence="30">226 II-PETER JONES it is implicitly critical, laughter implies diminished endorsement of its object. Bergson, indeed, claims that absence of feeling is characteristic of laughter, and the notion of sympathetic laughter almost a contradiction in terms. The last claim can be re-formulated, perhaps, as insisting that when we laugh with someone we are endorsing their perception of something else as incongruous, or whatever; there is still an object of our amusement, albeit at one remove, and we are belittling that object. The art form which exemplifies my remarks about the moral dimension of laughter is satire, and Bergson suggested that satirists are often frustrated moralists disguised as mere analysts, their frustration revealing itself in their pessimism. The aim of satire is, indeed, often as much to instruct and reform as to entertain, and a common theme is the gap between appearance and reality. The pleasure we take in unmasking hypocrisy or duplicity would be unintelligible unless we held the truth to be preferable to falsehood, and satire cannot begin to succeed until we are convinced that what we are told is so is so. Satire differs from many other art forms, of course, in two important respects; firstly, it makes direct reference to something presumed to be within the experience or knowledge of its expected audience; secondly, its stance is avowedly partial, and its audience is normally expected to recognise that. If laughter typically inhibits action, however, it might be claimed that satire's goal of changing people's beliefs and attitudes is radically misconceived; displacement of views might be achieved by belittling them, but the task of replacing them remains. Victims of satire sometimes complain that it is merely negative in this way, but they fail to see that satire is a hybrid which claims the immunity of an art form to make moral pronouncements, and the right of a moralist to belittle opponents. Jokes, typically, are killed by explanation. At the other extreme, one's pleasure in satire is often augmented by explanation or commentary. In either case, of course, understanding is a necessary condition of amusement, although not sufficient; but what counts as understanding depends on the kind of case, and it is only and precisely something as thought of in certain ways that is found amusing. My interest and efforts to gain your endorsement of my responses reflects the value I place on those responses and their objects. About a pun or trivial joke I am less exercised than</page><page sequence="31">LAUGHTER 227 about Tartuffe. If, as Hume claimed, we share with our fellows a natural interest in anything pleasing, we not only want to know what pleases them, but also to celebrate with them what pleases us. In order to experience those pleasures we need to know, and to let others know, how to stand with regard to the situation in question; if others fail to see things in the way we do we inevitably begin to doubt the propriety of our view, and begin to experience social discontinuity. For shared responses are essential elements in mutual understanding and social harmony. Not to know whether to laugh on a particular occasion is unsettling; and our discomfort is rooted in our uncertainty about what responses are appropriate, and thus our uncertainty about what, in the fullest sense, is going on. Hume, it will be recalled, held that phenomena of certain kinds, if perceived in definable ways, cause normal people to respond in recognisably similar ways; and any change in the way the phenomena are thought of causes different responses. Only two more of Hume's observations on taste need detain us in our attempt to relate them to amusement. Firstly, he is right that some verdicts stem from personal, social or cultural idiosyncrasies; moreover, our own tastes do change as we grow older, and we are frequently incapable of regaining or even comprehending the enthusiasms of our youth. These remarks apply, pari passu, to laughter and amusement generally. Secondly, as we saw, matters of taste must sometimes be subordinated to matters of morals. This claim must suffice to remind us of the issues concerning the moral propriety of laughter itself, as distinct from the propriety or impropriety at which the laughter is directed. My reflections have been limited to the two insights Scruton selected from traditional accounts of laughter. Like him I have left unanalysed many notions which recur in my remarks, such as 'point of view' and 'pleasure', and like him I have confined myself to what seems to be characteristic of humour, rather than attempt to discern its necessary and sufficient conditions. But the result is a series of generalities which must be replaced, if the issues are to be pursued, by patient inquiry into each constituent notion and a sensitive scrutiny of the relevant phenomena. The occasions on which we laugh are so varied that it would be surprising if a single theory adequately explained and illuminated them all; I have implied that instances of joyful, defiant, and</page><page sequence="32">228 II-PETER JONES triumphant laughter, for example, merit separate treatment, and that cases of forced and hollow laughter fall outside the domain of amusement altogether. I have agreed that amusement is a mode of thought, in some ways akin to aesthetic interest. But I have suggested that it is characteristically detached and belittling; the former notion refers to the spectatorial viewpoint of laughter, and it implies a viewer's disengagement and (perhaps temporary) non-participation in the action; the latter notion implies partiality and, moreover, some measure of disagreement. Because it is disengaged but not disinterested, laughter is often resented on the grounds that it is merely negative and hinders the active pursuit of goals; in this sense it is essentially parasitic, depending on the prior and separate existence of going concerns, of decisions, actions, beliefs and situations. This is not to say that the comic is parasitic upon the tragic, but it does raise doubts about what a sustained comic view of life would be like. Philosophy is typically pursued in a humourless fashion, as has here been demonstrated, and the use of wit or irony by such writers as Voltaire or Diderot has sometimes been deplored on the ground that these devices disguise, when they do not militate against, sustained and precise argument. One remedy is to broaden one's conception of argument and its goals, and to acknowledge a wider range of activities as pursuing those goals, and thus as being philosophical. When Jung died, he was described on the wireless as having adopted a breuder view than fraud. NOTES 'H. Bergson, 'Le Rire' in Oeuvres, ed. A.
