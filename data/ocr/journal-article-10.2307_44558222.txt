KELSO Background Since the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which prohibited atmospheric detonations of nuclear de- vices, simulation techniques have been used to obtain information concerning blast and shock effects on mili- tary weapon systems and to further understand the phe- nomena associated with such explosions.1 Shock tubes and a variety of blast load generators have been used as small-scale simulation devices. The United States, under the sponsorship of the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA), formerly the Defense Atomic Support Agency, has par- ticipated in Canada in a series of high-explosive test programs beginning with a 5-ton TNT shot in 1959, fol- lowed by 20-, 100-, and 500-ton TNT tests in 1960, 1961, and 1964. In 1965, three 500-ton TNT charges were detonated on the island of Kahoolawe, Hawaii, and two additional 500-ton TNT tests were made in Canada in 1968 and 1970 - all to obtain data on basic blast and shock phenomena as well as to obtain target response information on military weapon systems, equipment, and structures. A large number of smaller yield high-explo- sive tests, ranging in size from 20 to 100 tons of TNT, have been conducted in the United States as well as sev- eral more using such explosive sources as detonable gases, ammonium nitrate/fuel oil, and others. IN mosphere, testing THE of continuing simulated a large-scale program nuclear high-explosive detonations of non-nuclear (HE) in the field ex- at- testing of simulated nuclear detonations in the at- mosphere, a large-scale high-explosive (HE) ex- periment called Operation Mixed Company (MC) was completed in 1972 under the sponsorship of the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA). The primary objec- tive for MC was to provide a simulated 1.8-kt air- blast environment for target response experiments for the military services and defense agencies; to obtain cratering and ground shock information in layered media (partly cemented silty sand over sandstone) not previously tested; and to confirm empirical pre- dictions and theoretical calculations for cratering, ground shock, and response of military structures, equipment, and weapon systems. A 500-ton spherical 1See "Project SLEDGE" [M.E. Sept. -Oct. 1966], "Operation Dis- tant Plain" [M.E. Jan. -Feb. 1968], "Operation Prairie Flat" [M.E. Jan. -Feb. 1971], and "Ammonium Nitrate/Fuel Oil Explosives" [M.E. May-June 1973] by the authors. TNT charge, resting on the surface, was chosen for this test. Following a year of investigation, a site was selected approximately 18 miles west of Grand Junc- tion, Colorado. The geology consisted of approximate- ly 5.5 feet of sand overburden with a layer of friable or weak sandstone to a depth of 12 feet where the competent sandstone started. EVENTS I AND II During the preparation for the main event (500 tons of TNT), two TNT charges were detonated to confirm ground motion predictions for the main event and to rate gages. In addition, data were obtained to correlate the crater size and ejecta distribution from previous explosions with the same charge configura- tion in different soil and rock media. Event I was a 20-ton spherical HE charge, half buried (Figure la), and was detonated on June 1, 1972 (Figure lb). A Figure la. Event I Charge Figure lb.

Event II Detonation 20-ton spherical charge resting on the surface (Figure 2a) , a scaled replica of the main event, was detonated on July 13, 1972 (Figure 2b). Both charges were built up of 32.6-pound cast TNT blocks. The Event II charge was supported around the lower half of the sphere with special high-strength polyurethane blocks which had been used previously to construct this type of configuration. They were also used on the main event. EVENT III- MAIN EVENT The main event (1,000,000 pounds) consisted of 30,600 blocks of TNT in a spherical charge 27 feet in diameter (Figure 3). Forty American projects, two from the United Kingdom, and four from Canada, were involved in this event and were divided into four programs. Program 1, Air Blast. - Various air-blast parameters as well as the structural response of aboveground structures and military equipment were measured. Three air-blast lines were installed to measure the free field environment on the surface and at heights up to 40 feet with overpressure and dynamic pressure gages. Hydrodynamic calculations were made that gave theoretical results which were to be verified later by the measurements. Military equipment exposed to the air-blast wave included model nose cones (Figure 4), helicopters inside revetments (Figure 5), full- scale aircraft shelters and doors (Figures 6a and 6b), tactical antennas and electronic shelters (Figure 7), and various Army weapons, such as the M-109 Self Propelled Howitzer (Figure 8). In addition, several projects included the measuring of the size and dis- tribution of dust particles picked up by the blast wave on the surface. Also, aircraft were flown through the mushroom cloud after the detonation to obtain information on the amount of dust carried aloft. Program 3, Ground Shock. - This program consisted of detailed measurements of the crater, ground shock, ejecta, and the response of underground structures. The apparent crater was measured by photography and surveying after the detonation. The dimensions of Figure 3.

Helicopters in Revetments the true crater were determined by excavating the colored sand columns which were installed prior to the detonation. Air-blast-induced and direct ground shock measurements were taken in two separate gage lines in the three geological layers from 90 to 1,430 feet from ground zero. Over 400 measurements were taken for later correlation with theoretical computer predictions. Newly developed ground shock gages were placed just below the charge and at various depths in the anticipated crater region. Some of the targets tested were model silos, underground electronic sys- tems, and personnel shelters. Most of the emphasis in Mixed Company was concerned with this program. Program 4, Biomedical . - Anthropomorphic dum- mies were placed in open personnel shelters and two- man fighting bunkers at different pressure levels. Their displacement caused by the blast wave was re- corded by high-speed photography. Program 9, Photography and Support. - High-speed cameras recording at rates up to 25,000 frames per Figure 6a.

Aerial photography was taken at detonation by an aircraft flying over ground zero at 20,000 feet to determine if any asymmetries of the blast wave were present. PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT The inhabitants of Grand Junction were some- what apprehensive concerning the effects from 1,000,- 000 pounds of TNT being exploded at a test site within 18 miles of their city. Numerous briefings were given to the local press and officials, including Con- gressional staff members in Washington, D. C. A de- tailed Environmental Impact Statement was filed in accordance with established procedures. In addition, two observation points were set up on the day of the shot - one for the press and one for the public - to observe the detonation. Press coverage included a na- tional television network crew. Over-all control of test site operations, before and after the main event, was exercised by the technical staff at a central station. The actual countdown was broadcast over loudspeak- ers at both observation points. TEST RESULTS The 1,000,000-pound spherical charge of TNT was successfully detonated on November 13, 1972 (Fig- ure 9) after a four-day hold because of inclement weather. The apparent crater diameter was 117 feet with an average depth of 11.9 feet (Figure 10). The crater had a somewhat flat bottom near the hard competent sandstone with fairly steep sides. This re- sult agreed with pretest predictions. Several anomalies in the blast wave, recorded by high-speed photogra- phy, consisted of luminous jets and nonluminous dust jets outrunning the main shock wave which produced nonidealized flow that affected some of the above- ground projects. Such anomalies have been observed from the other 500-ton TNT explosions and are con- sidered to be inherent with a charge of this configu- ration and size. The underground structures and the Figure 9. Detonation of Main Event ground motion gages were not affected by the anomalies. The air-blast instrumentation recorded the free field environment from 10,000 to 0.01 psi. An excel- lent gradation of damage levels, ranging up to severe, were observed on all structures and equipment, both above and below ground. There were some surprises in these results which confirmed the value of such high-explosive proof tests in the field to verify design hardness or predicted vulnerability to blast effects. The ground shock instruments functioned exceed- ingly well, including the gages just below the charge. High-speed cameras documented the fireball growth and shock wave expansion. Operation Mixed Company was a most successful experiment with most of the projects achieving their stated objectives. The results given here are, of course, but a small portion of the great amount of scientific data obtained. The experimental results will be cor- related with other high-explosive and nuclear infor- mation to extend and improve the knowledge of the effects of nuclear weapons on military weapons sys- tems and equipment.
