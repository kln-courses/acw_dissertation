<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Romance of Victorian Natural History. By Lynn L. Merrill. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989. Pp. x+ 288; 12 illustra tions. $29.95. The title of Lynn Merrill's book echoes that of the marine biologist-cum fanatical-creationist Philip Henry Gosse's best-selling Romance of Natural His tory (i860). "Romance" was one of the catchwords that suggested themselves most frequently when a Victorian author was choosing, doubtless with his publisher's assistance, the name of his new book that sought to popularize a subject, and it was particularly apposite in the case of that most widespread and longest-lived of all Victorian hobbies, the study of "natural history." "Naturalists," says Merrill, "are chroniclers of nature's romance. . . . Romance and high gratification is exactly what the Victorian public hoped for from its natural history books" (p. 71). Although such books understandably have no place in the literature of sci ence and do not constitute a formal genre of literature itself, their number was "almost beyond counting." So said Charles Kingsley in his own early con tribution, Glaucus: or, The Wonders of the Shore. This was in 1855, and the en thusiasm, which lasted roughly from 1820 to 1870, had not yet peaked. Most of the men and women who bought the books, and at least some of the chil dren who received them as "rational" gifts, were not content with reading about the ingratiating wonders of nature. The unconverted may have de rided them as "spider stuffers" and "bug hunters," but out to the woods and marshes and seaside they went, sometimes armed with these books as discur sive field guides, together with the apparatus of their respective specialties, nets for capturing butterflies and marine life, lenses, hammers, glass jars, vials, and, at the end of the period, cameras. Natural history was the layman's?and to some extent the laywoman's? version of empirical science. While professional scientists busied themselves in their laboratories and demonstration rooms, naturalists spent their leisure hours on what were essentially high-minded treasure hunts, bearing home their booty of shells, rocks, plants, insects, small aquatic beings. In a de facto cultural dichotomy that was formalized by Matthew Arnold and Thomas Henry Huxley in their celebrated exchange, scientists were men who were guided by their intellect, while naturalists, amateurs almost by definition and motivated by their imagination and their hovering love of the beautiful, be longed to the humanists' camp. Gosse said of his Romance of Natural History</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 419 that it was "an attempt to present natural history in its aesthetic fashion." But the naturalists and the supposedly unaesthetic scientists?chemists, physicists, geologists, biologists?shared a thirst to know more, the naturalists by obser vation and description that was more appreciative than rigorous, the scientists by experimentation and measurement. "An empirical age had no difficulty in reconciling true, objective facts with 'wonder' and 'curiosity'?two words that set the tone for Victorian natural history" (p. 88). In tracing the development of natural history as it became an entity that both was and was not separate from "hard" science, Merrill somewhat under estimates the influence of the early Victorian zeal for self-improvement and the accompanying institutionalization of that impulse in the mechanics' insti tute movement. It was especially there that the seeds of the naturalist's avoca tion, an exercise in the pleasurable and inexpensive combining of didacticism and piety, were nurtured. (Merrill might have done more with the piety angle: in the demotic intellectual history of the time, natural history repre sented a belated outcropping of Paleyan natural theology.) The benign infec tion was widely distributed, from working class to intelligentsia. Elizabeth Gaskell's description, in Mary Barton, of the Oldham weavers' devotion to bot any and entomology, however, grossly exaggerates its prevalence, above all when she begins it with an incredible allusion to workers who kept Newton's Principia "open on the loom, to be snatched at in work hours, but revelled over in meal times, or at night." More credible was the imposing real-life figure of the polymath George Henry Lewes, whose field practice of natural history "exemplifies many of its most typical Victorian manifestations," as Merrill demonstrates (p. 29). As a whole, the book well illustrates the expansive tendencies of present day scholarship, where the old arbitrary barriers that segregated one area of interest from related ones are being steadily erased. Merrill is adept at expos ing the numerous tendrils that relate the naturalist's pursuit to a variety of other social and cultural phenomena of the time. But she concentrates on natural history's literary associations and most especially on the style of the books it generated in such abundance. "The language they engendered em phasized meticulous detail, and their wide readership ensured that the lan guage of natural history influenced other forms of literature as well. A love of concrete natural specimens created a demand for particularity and specificity in both language and art" (p. 5). Scattered throughout the volume is a series of stylistic analyses, a supplement, in effect, to those found in George Levine and William Madden's Art of Victorian Prose (1968). In addition to the inevi table moralizing and sentimentalizing?including numerous excursions into anthropomorphism?the characteristics of naturalists' prose Merrill isolates are its participatory flavor (the constant use of the chummy "we"), its high incidence of metaphor, its subjectivity, and, of course, its particularity. Along the way one finds a chapter comparing the styles of Ruskin and his American antitype, the naturalist John Burroughs. Much of Chapters 8 and 9 is devoted to equally interesting dissections and evaluations of Gosse's and Kingsley's respective rhetorical methods. The self-taught Hugh Miller's famous contri bution to the popularized nineteenth-century literature of geology, The Old Red Sandstone; or, New Walks in an Old Field ( 1841 ), made him "one of the most beloved of Victorian naturalists because of the power of his style" (p. 238), but he is the only writer in Merrill's display case whose prose she admits she can</page><page sequence="3">420 Altick not stomach. Each to his/her own tastes, however. Lynn Barber in her enter taining The Heyday of Natural History (1980) finds Miller's prose "lucid, always finding the exact happy simile," full of powerful, sensuous visualization. Mer rill considers Philip Gosse "one of the consummate stylists of the period" (p. 18), which seems a bit much by anybody's standards and evidently does not take account of his Omphalos, which Barber finds "exceptionally dull." The psychology of perception and the ways it determines the "vision" of writers and artists is the subject of a chapter titled "Museums and Micro scopes," an able discussion of the manner in which natural history writing employed both the minute vision and the wide-screen view, which Gerhard Joseph has called, when it appears in poetry like Tennyson's, the "bifocal dia lectic." Here, once again, Merrill depicts the relatively constricted field of natural history as a focal point drawing together a mixture of outside tenden cies. "The ascendancy of the previously humble ?tude, the exhortations of Ruskin about the importance of careful sketching, the invention of photogra phy, the Pre-Raphaelite love affair with details, and the scrutinizing concerns of natural history?all interpenetrate" (p. 178). As in some other places, how ever, Merrill's partiality to her subject distorts relationships and values. Loosening the frame of reference to include painters only peripherally associ ated with the Pre-Raphaelites, she insists, contrary to received opinion, that "Pre-Raphaelite particularity falls within the discourse of natural history" rather than that of science and photography (p. 165). This is a case of revi sionism that may or may not stick. In general, whenever a choice is available, Merrill is prone to champion the claims of natural history as against those of science. To her, Darwin's Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural His tory of the Various Countries Visited by H. M. S. "Beagle" (a.k.a. The Voyage of the Beagle) is "natural history at its best," but its considerably greater distinction is that it is a classic of scientific writing. Merrill includes several pages on the place that simplified natural history books had in the formative reading of middle-class children. In that connec tion we learn, astonishingly, that natural history writing, for adults as well as for children, was not exempt from bowdlerization. "Accuracy is paramount, and one can never have a surfeit of details. Except that,?well, certain details might not be suitable for all readers, especially the young" (p. 24). The Rev. J. G. Wood, a leading popularizer, expunged from the text of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne "many passages . . . which, although useful to the scientific naturalist, might possibly have given offence to those whose studies in Natural History are not of a rigidly scientific character" (his words). One wonders what extensive cuts he would have made in that other classic of eigh teenth-century natural history, Erasmus Darwin's Loves of the Plants. The Victorian natural history cult had its mildly comic side. It naturally, so to speak, attracted a good representation of splendid eccentrics, such as the zoophagous Frank Buckland, proprietor of the wildly miscellaneous Eco nomic Fish Museum in South Kensington and a man whose palate and di gestive system were equal to whatever choice viands the entire animal king dom sent his way. The friction generated between rivals in a given specialty was sometimes carried to ludicrous extremes. But the movement's intentions were wholly praiseworthy, and, given the number of apparatus suppliers it required, from microscope makers to the manufacturers of aquariums, it even contributed to the national prosperity. Most important, perhaps, it pro</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 421 vided both to the lungs of devotees, driven from smoke-palled cities into the unspoiled countryside, and to the popular literature of the time, a welcome breath of fresh air.
