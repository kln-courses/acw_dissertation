Terry Terry Engineering ABSTRACT The goals of this NASA Phase II SBIR program were to develop design methodology to improve occupant survivability in small composite airplanes. Current technology small airplanes absorb crash energy primarily in the cabin structure. The current study tried to increase strength of the occupant compartment and design energy absorbing structure outside the passenger compartment. Dynamics of the crash event were analyzed using a PC version of DYNA3D. Four full scale tests in two crash scenarios were conducted at the NASA Impact Dynamics Test Facility with test parameters set to allow direct comparison with prior NASA/FAA tests. Results indicate that occupant survivability can be improved with moderate weight penalty. INTRODUCTION The crashworthiness of general aviation aircraft represents an important design consideration. In the years 1972 through 1981, more than 12,500 people were killed and more than 6,600 seriously injured in general aviation accidents [1-2] 1. More recently, there were an average of 756 fatalities per year in general aviation accidents for the years 1991 through 1995 [3]. The NTSB studied a number of accidents in detail and concluded that fatalities could be reduced 20% if all occupants wore shoulder harnesses and 88% of seriously injured occupants would have less serious injuries if shoulder harnesses were worn. Energy absorbing seats could reduce injury severity of 34% of the seriously injured occupants and reduce fatalities about 2%. A number of failures contributing to injury severity included such factors as: Seat feet or frame failure Seat track failure Seat pan failure Seat belt or belt attachment failure 1 Numbers in brackets indicate reference number. Structural design of the aircraft was not addressed. In 1 982, 77% of fixed wing general aviation fatalities were in single reciprocating engine aircraft, 19% in twin reciprocating engine aircraft, and 4% for all turbine powered aircraft [4], This indicates that the largest life saving potential is with single engine airplanes with improved survivability features but it is just this type of airplane in which it is most difficult to provide the necessary energy absorbing structure. In general, the emphasis of current airplane designs was placed on good handling characteristics, performance, and costs. Minimal emphasis was placed on crashworthiness and little or no crashworthiness data were available for this class of airplanes. The design of any airplane requires many compromises and some of these affect crashworthiness. The quarter chord of the MAC (mean aerodynamic chord) is generally located near or under the front seats for static stability requirements leading to a spar location under the front seats for many airplanes. Other airplanes have the spar located under the front edge of the rear seats with stability requirements met by locating the spar at 40 to 50% of chord, forward sweep to the spars, far forward or aft CG diagrams, or some combination of the above. Small airplanes have less than or non-existent under- floor space compared with larger aircraft. Space limitations also restrict the seat stroking space available in these designs. Some of the two-place homebuilt designs locate the seats between the spars with the bottom of the seat on the lower skin. Increasing the under floor depth increases weight, degrades appearance, and reduces performance with consequent loss of customer appeal. The accidents studied in [2] were mostly off-airport and into soil rather than on hard surfaces. The US Army Crashworthiness Design Guide [5] reports that nearly 75% of all aircraft accidents occur off the runway. A limited number of whole airplane, pendulum-type drop tests have been conducted of both high wing and low wing single engine designs by NASA and the FAA [6-7] and show very different airplane responses to soil than to hard surfaces. The results of these tests show that 45</page><page sequence="2">traditional single engine designs tend to dig into the soil upon impact, producing approximately twice the deceleration of similar crashes on concrete. This results in the catastrophic failure of the fuselage structure with a complete loss of cabin integrity and survivable volume. The airplanes tested, typical of many general aviation airplanes, had very little energy absorbing material outside of the cabin. A more survivable scenario can be envisioned where energy absorbing structure ahead of the cabin absorbs the initial crash impact and forms a sliding surface for soil impacts to minimize soil scooping. Recent developments in automobiles, both street and racing, have shown that fatalities and injuries can be reduced substantially by designing the structure outside the cabin to absorb energy while keeping the cabin relatively undeformed. Similar development of helicopters for the US Army has shown the same results. Figure 1 . Engine Mount Static Analysis The purpose of this project was to apply these concepts to a small general aviation airplane to extend the survival envelope and reduce the severity of injuries in survivable accidents. A combination of analysis, quasi-static half scale tests, and full scale tests were used in the development. Two crash scenarios were selected for this project to match two of the prior tests [7]. The two conditions were for flight path angles of -30° on concrete and the -30° on soft soil with zero roll, yaw, and angle of attack and an impact velocity of about 82 ft/sec. ANALYSIS Terry Engineering acquired a two part finite element analysis program capable of running on a PC. The first part was a static linear elastic analysis program and the second part was for dynamic non-linear large deflection problems. A variety of different material properties are supported in the dynamic program. ENGINE MOUNT - A number of mount configurations were analyzed by the following process. A wire frame drawing of the engine mount was transferred to the preprocessor using an IGES transfer. Nodes and elements were defined in the preprocessor. The tubes were treated as beams for the analysis with material properties of 4130 steel. Beam elements consist of a center line, cross sectional area, and the moments of inertia in two axes. Two 25,000 lb. loads (representing 20g deceleration for a 2,500 pound airplane) were applied to the initial contact points on the mount at a 30 degree impact angle (Figure 1) and the linear elastic solution obtained. The process was repeated with tube sizes adjusted to keep stresses for tubes not intended to fail first under 70,000 psi (based on as welded condition [11]) using linear analysis. The tubes intended to fail first were sized to have stresses over 70,000 psi. A dynamic analysis was then made using the same beam element and node layout as the elastic solution. Material properties were changed to resultant plasticity (elastic, plastic) with yield stress set at 70,000 psi. The firewall mount points of the mount were given a fixed boundary condition with the mount in the expected impact position of 30 degrees nose down. Impact was simulated by a "stonewall" weighing 2500 lb. having an upward vertical velocity of 40 ft/sec. The stonewall was initially in contact with the mount at the same nodes where the loads were applied for the elastic solution. The installed propulsion system mass (rigid body mass) was attached to appropriate nodes representing the engine mounts. This analysis doesn't allow the motions that an airplane has in an impact but the Vz scale tests don't either so the analysis represents these tests. Half scale tests were conducted in the Wichita State University Structures Laboratory for comparison with the analysis. Tests were conducted against a hard surface with only the engine mount and against soft soil with the engine mount and cowling. The Vz size models were pushed against the surface at a 30 degree angle to simulate the expected full scale test angle by a hydraulic actuation. Load cells recorded the actuator force and some of the tests had strain gages to record strains in various mount elements. These tests could not simulate the dynamics of a crash in that actuation was slow and the model was not allowed to rotate as the airplane does in a crash event. Engine mount analysis continued throughout the Vz scale test period with refinements trying to improve the correlation with test data. The simulated engine used in the tests stabilizes the engine mount rail whereas the early calculations without any engine simulation showed buckling in the rail. A real engine in a real crash would also be expected to provide some stability to the rail and it was thought important to match the failure sequence of the mount tubes as well as possible in the analysis. The first attempt to replicate the engine using rigid links supported on springs simulating the engine mount isolators was unsuccessful. It was found that a rigid mass, simulating the powerplant installation mass and moment of inertia, could be added to the calculations. This stabilized the rail but the overall failure pattern changed from that observed in the tests, basically the mass held the front of the mount down more than observed in the half scale tests. Mass was reduced to 1/100 times installed powerplant mass which retained the 46</page><page sequence="3">rigid mass characteristic but brought the calculated failure pattern closer to test (inertial loads are negligible for the stroke rates used in these tests). Material tests also showed that the tubing used had yield strength well above 70,000 psi and analysis was changed to 90,000 psi. A test mount that the half scale tests indicated had good energy absorption characteristics at the correct force level for the planned tests is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Half Scale Mount AIRPLANE - The engine mount analysis models were 3 dimensional and had run times up to 8 hours. It was decided to simplify the full airplane model by making it 2 dimensional in an attempt to get reasonable model development time and run times. The engine mount was simplified by taking the 2 dimensional view of the mount and treating all the elements as having twice the area and moment of inertia of the tubes for the design mount. Engine mount materials were steel elastic-plastic. The fuselage was modeled by the following process. Top and bottom beams areas were based on the fuselage perimeter measured between the 45 degree tangency's on either side of the section loft and material thickness' (.085 for two sides of the aft fuselage sandwich) for typical structure for this type of airplane. Frames (other than the door frames) were estimated based on typical frames. Internal structural beams were modeled similar to the engine mount elements except that material properties were for fiberglass. Sidewall shear was simulated by plate elements with material thickness of .080 aft of the rear door frame (based on two plies inside and outside and two sides of the airplane) and .170 forward where additional plies were used. Core materials were neglected. Four node quad plates were used for all shear elements, some elements look like triangles but the program uses one node twice to make them a four node quad plate. Areas containing doors, windows, and windshield were left open. It was thought that the low modulus of elasticity of the window and windshield material would make them ineffective and that the doors could open easily. Linear elastic properties for fiberglass laminate (+/- 45°) were used for the airframe elements except for the door frames. The vertical member aft of the windshield is actually the front door frame which more resembles a hoop than a post. Effective stiffness of that frame was calculated using a static analysis of the frame. The rear door frame was arbitrarily set at half the stiffness of the front door frame initially but later they were the same. Beam elements are shown in the model by rectangles where the width of the rectangle is representative of the beam moment of inertia so the relative size of the beams can be seen in the model. Figure 3. Dynamic Analysis Model, First Test Rigid masses (which do not show in the preprocessor drawing) simulated the powerplant installation, two front seat passengers, one rear seat passenger, and the empennage. Rigid masses have both mass and moment of inertia and are attached to nodes. Structural nodes did not exist in the model at the correct locations to simulate the engine and front seat passengers so small frames were added to correctly position the masses for the correct center of gravity positions and the correct moment of inertia. The rest of the airplane mass was simulated by nodal masses (which also do not show) placed according to a Cirrus Design weight estimate taking into account the structural mass of the model. Both horizontal and vertical mass locations were considered in the spread. Total mass represents three passengers and mid mission fuel (2500 pound gross weight). Some models contained a windshield post and parametric studies were run of variations in the windshield post, door frame, and cabin top including both straight and curved sections. Seat decelerations were sensitive to buckling of any of these members. If the element was stabilized by shear panels, modulus of elasticity and cross sectional area were found to be the important parameters with moment of inertia of little importance. Moment of inertia of the element was very important for unstabilized elements. Pictures from test 1 were analyzed to compare fuselage deflection to the analysis and fuselage deflection was found to be small compared to the analytical model meaning the model was not correctly predicting the fuselage flexibility. In developing the model, I had assumed that the windshield, doors, and windows were not effective in fuselage bending because of low modulus 47</page><page sequence="4">of elasticity and the following events. The windshield had popped out in test 1, the doors had come loose, and the pilot side window fractured. There was no window installed in the right side rear location to allow exit of instrumentation cables. The video of test 1 was reviewed carefully to determine when these events occurred and it appeared they occurred on the second impact, aft fuselage slap down. This could not be determined with 1 00% certainty due to camera motion but I believe it to be correct. The analytical model was modified to contain shear panels representing the doors and windows and a beam representing the windshield (Figure 4). Area and moment of inertia for the windshield beam was estimated as 90 degrees of arc of a 22 inch radius circle. Modulus of elasticity was set at 400,000 psi as shown on a data sheet for cast acrylic. The door in the model of Figure 4 was not separated from the rest of the structure while the doors of the test airplanes were attached at 4 points. Analysis with the door attached to the structure at 4 nodes showed no significant difference in airplane dynamics and internal loads were essentially the same except for cabin top loads which increased somewhat. This model took nearly twice as long to run so most of the structural loads development used the faster running model. Figure 4. Dynamic Analysis Model, Tests 3 &amp; 4 The design concept called for the floor to be the primary structural element in the lower fuselage with foam blocks under the floor in three locations for energy absorbers. Both foam blocks and edge loaded composite sandwich panels had been looked at in Phase I [8] of the contract. Data from a number of sources indicate that edge loaded panels work well only for unidirectional loads while foam blocks tend to work well for omnidirectional loads. Further, foam blocks are much cheaper to fabricate and install than panels. Springs representing these blocks used a general non-linear spring formulation which allowed user specified load versus deflection data both for loading and unloading. The foam blocks used for under floor energy absorption were thought to have little or no rebound under dynamic conditions so the unloading curve was quickly brought near zero and then to zero with a small finite slope to simulate the out of contact condition. The small finite slope was necessary for stability of the calculations. "Levers" are shown under the floor to position the springs since the analysis program did not define the line of action of the springs. The spring loading curve was based on the cross sectional area of the blocks and the spring rate given for rigid, closed-cell, polyurethane foam increased by 30% for dynamic loading as given by the manufacturer [12]. For the engine mount analysis, the mount had been stationary and the stone wall moving. The airplane model reversed this with the stone wall considered fixed in space and the model was given an initial velocity of 40 ft/sec downward. Model angle was set at 30 degrees to the stone wall. Engine mount tube sizes were varied to bring the forward part of the airplane to rest while keeping seat decelerations under 20 g for the initial impact. Spring loading curves were varied to keep seat decelerations under 20 g for the secondary impact. The design goal was to absorb the energy outside the cabin structure to maintain the people space undamaged. This means that the initial ground reaction will be farther from the center of gravity than if the energy is absorbed in cabin deformation. The result is higher angular acceleration of the airplane and a more severe secondary impact or aft fuselage slap down. Springs were initially located under the firewall, under the main spar, and under the rear spar. The rear spar location was found to cause a "jolt" at the crew seat location. Various positions of the rear spring were tried and moving the spring aft to a position just aft of the rear seat was found to eliminate the "jolt". This analysis (two dimensional model) can only simulate a symmetrical hard surface impact without ground friction. The engine mass has been included but the engine size and shape has not been included. Tests 1 and 4 (hard surface) both had the oil pan hit the surface early fracturing the pan. All four engine mount brackets broke in test 1, but the engine remained in the mount, and this cannot be simulated at this time. The analysis program is supposed to allow stopping the analysis, make changes in parameters, and restart. Attempts to do this were unsuccessful and more development would be needed to make this process work. Engine isolators were not modeled. One attempt was made to do this without success. 48</page><page sequence="5">, „i j - Movable bridge and AUX";at7orm , y „i A j - platform Umbilical plattorm Movable camera with camera mounts -v plal 1 Data transfer^//L--^*^^ U W Iß VV A'W^ Impact surface Movable photog^phic^J^^ ^ U' Camera '- Cameras Figure 5. Diagram of NASA Impact Dynamics Research Facility FULL SCALE TESTS TEST FACILITIES - The full scale crash tests were performed at the Langley Impact Dynamics Research Facility shown in Figure 5. The gantry is composed of truss elements arranged with three sets of inclined legs to give vertical and lateral support and another set of inclined legs to provide longitudinal support. The gantry is 240 feet high and 400 feet long. The supporting legs are spread 266 feet apart at the ground and 66 feet apart at the 216 foot level. An enclosed elevator and a stairway provide access to the overhead work platforms and catwalks permit safe traverse of the upper levels of the gantry. A movable bridge spans the gantry at the 21 6 foot level and traverses the length of the gantry. Shown in Figure 5 is an illustration of a test airplane suspended from the gantry in the release position. The reinforced concrete impact surface permits tests to be repeated and allows comparison between tests. A soil bed approximately 2.5 to 3.0 feet deep was placed on the concrete surface for tests 2 and 3. The soil bed was intended to replicate the prior NASA soil beds [9] but was somewhat softer. Detailed information about the facilities used and test procedures to carry out the full scale crash tests are reported in [10], An instrumentation layout is shown in Figure 6. Three cameras (not shown) were installed in the cabin. A wide angle lens camera was installed on the subpanel looking aft at the dummies. Two cameras (one for test 4) were mounted on the hat shelf behind the baggage compartment looking forward. Test 4 had one camera focused on the legs of the stroking rear seat. Two cameras were installed on the ground at each of the following locations: forward of the impact point along the flight path side of the impact point normal to the flight path behind the impact point along the flight path on the gantry above the impact point At each location, one camera had a long focal length lens and one had a wider angle lens. All cameras were 16mm with a nominal framing rate of 400 frames per second. Two 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummies were used in tests 1 , 2, and 3 and three were used in test 4. Each was instrumented with three axis accelerometers in the head, one accelerometer in the pelvis, and a lumbar load cell. 49</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7. Structural Concept, Airplanes 3 &amp; 4 DESIGN CONCEPTS - The program plan was to test two airplanes, one each on a hard surface and on soft soil and to apply the lessons learned from those tests to improve the design. Two new airframes would then be built and the tests repeated. The last two airframes were intended to represent nearly flight weight airplanes. The first two airplanes were based on early analysis and conservative design practice and were overly strong and over weight. Engine mounts were intended to have the correct energy absorbing characteristics and seats and restraint systems were intended to be representative of good practice. The following description of the structural concept will focus on the last two airplanes. These were intended to show that the same design could be used for both the hard surface and soft soil impacts The structure behind the firewall and the engine mount would be simplified if the engine mount did not have the two central posts to the firewall. A new analytical model of the mount was made eliminating these tubes and the analysis showed that the mount collapses inward at low load without those two posts. A cross piece between the two sides of the mount solves the problem but can't be used at the proper location because of the engine accessory case. Several types of cross beams designed to pass under the accessory case were evaluated analytically with poor results. Lateral support beams 50</page><page sequence="7">from the mount to the lower corners of the firewall were found to work well analytically. However, under high enough impact conditions the engine will tend to rotate up and back through the firewall. It was thought that the central tubes and the supporting structure behind the firewall would tend to keep the engine out of the cabin. An aluminum cross tube was located behind the firewall to take the engine mount loads and provide a ductile material to provide further resistance to engine penetration into the cabin. This square extrusion is not as light as a beam designed for the moment distribution but it was economical to acquire and install for this test series. Airplanes 1 and 2 had the lower engine mount firewall attachments in line with the floor to transfer loads directly into the floor. Dynamics analysis showed a significant difference in airplane response if the lower mount points were moved up to the break in the firewall. Basically, it gave about two inches more stroke before hitting a hard resistance point. The lower mount points were raised to the position shown in Figure 7. Loads were transferred into the floor through a firewall brace simulating a nose wheel well. This brace also resisted the vertical loads in the firewall. Solid sections were incorporated in the floor and firewall under the braces for shear strength. The upper engine mount loads were taken into the fuselage by support angles behind the aluminum cross tube which transferred the loads into the side beams under door by shear. These beams were small in comparison to those in the first two airplanes. The cabin top had failed in test 1 and analysis showed that a stiffener was needed to prevent buckling if the windshield carried any load. A stiffener was added. Both test 1 and the analysis indicated that the rear seat area had higher decelerations than the front seats in the hard surface impact. Two changes were made to try to improve survivability in this area. The rear under floor energy absorber was extended outside the loft for more stroke with a fairing as illustrated in Figure 7. And a stroking rear seat was installed as shown in Figure 8. This seat will be described more below. A partial frame was added to resist shoulder harness loads for the rear seat passenger. Loads from the rear energy absorber were taken by a "Z" section cross beam (Figures 7 &amp; 8) behind rear seat which formed the front edge of the baggage compartment. One of the wing rear spar attachment bolts had failed in test 2. While having parts separate from the airplane removes kinetic energy, it also increases the probability of breaking fuel lines and changes the loading on the energy absorbers. It is not known if this is favorable or not at this time since attempts to stop and restart the analysis with changes had not been successful. Rear spar attach fitting strength and the bolt size were increased for airplanes 3 and 4. Figure 8. JAARS Seat in Rear Location Two steps were taken to reduce the angular velocity of the hard surface impact with the first and primary step being the reduced engine mount strength. A very simplified analysis indicated that a stabilizer might provide significant aerodynamic resistance to rotation so a simple wooden horizontal stabilizer was installed for test 4. An aft fuselage stiffener was added, the core material for the upper aft fuselage was changed to provide better adhesion of fiberglass to the core, and an aft fuselage frame was added about midway between the aft of the baggage compartment and the empennage. These changes were all to delay the core to skin bond line failure seen in test 1 . HARD SURFACE TESTS Test 1 - The first full scale test was run at the NASA Impact Dynamics Research Facility on May 1, 1996. This test was designed to be a 30 degree impact angle, zero degree angle of attack impact on hard surface. The measured angle of attack was 6 degrees leading to an angle of impact relative to the ground of 24 degrees. Flight path angles were as planned for all tests. Roll and yaw were small. Impact velocity was about 85 ft/sec, slightly higher than planned . Primary data were recorded digitally with a limited time for data recording and the timing of the data collection was such that data for the secondary impact were not recorded. Backup data were recorded in analog format with a longer timing cycle which included the secondary impact. Timing counts were not coordinated between data groups so there is no way to accurately determine impact times for the different analog traces. A number of the analog traces were saturated and there are anomalies in the data which do not appear to be coming from the instruments reducing the ability to fully analyze the data. While there are problems in the analog data, the data show the characteristic indicated by the analysis that there are two impacts and that the second impact increases in strength going aft in the airplane. It also 51</page><page sequence="8">shows that there were two peaks in the copilot pelvis acceleration which appear to be of approximately equal magnitude. However, the data are misleading because the second peak saturated the data system so the real magnitude is not known. Figure 9. Engine Mount, Post Test 1 The engine mount (Figure 9) was expected to deform in a manner similar to the V2 scale hard surface tests in the WSU Laboratory (Figure 2). There is much less deformation in the full scale mount than the 1/2 scale mount and further, the deformation is of a different type. Whereas the tubes between the rails buckled on the half scale tests, they punched into the rails with very little buckling on the full scale mount. It appears that material strength and/or resistance to column buckling is higher under dynamic loading than static loading by a greater margin than expected. For example, the data show strains about twice the level at which buckling occurred in the half scale tests and this tube was nearly straight after the test. Data for mild steel [13] show that yield strength is increased by about 50 to 75% for strain rates comparable to these tests. Data are not given for 4130 steel. Airframe accelerations were consequently higher than expected. The half scale test indicated an acceleration of about 20 g while the data shows several times that much at the firewall (Figure 10). The higher than expected loads forward leads to higher than expected angular acceleration. The measured acceleration in the Z direction decreased moving aft and in fact changed direction between the baggage compartment and the tail. This characteristic is predicted by the analysis. One indication of the high angular acceleration is that aft fuselage fractured in up bending with the tail Z accelerometer measuring the order of 100 9- Figúrelo. Firewall Acceleration, Z Variations in engine mount yield strength were analyzed in an attempt to match the results of test 1 . Results were best matched by a yield strength of 150,000 or 175,000 psi although the model can't match the detailed failure pattern of the test 1 mount. The mount design was modified based on these calculations and resulted in a mount weighing about half that of the first mount. The half scale tests in soft soil had also shown the need for the lighter mount and the mounts for tests 2, 3, and 4 were based on this design. There was no loss of livable volume in the cabin with the film showing only small cabin deformation during the impact and neither dummy hit the instrument panel. It should be noted that there is more distance between the people and the instrument panel than in some current airplanes. There were fractures at the intersections of all structural members crossing the cabin at their attachment to the side walls which showed evidence of cabin deformation but the amount was too small to affect the occupants. The left hand seat, essentially a rigid seat with a rate sensitive foam cushion, gave a lumbar load approaching 3800 pounds. The right hand seat was also a rigid seat but had ä one inch thick rigid foam energy absorber under the rate sensitive foam cushion. Maximum lumbar load for this seat was about 2400 pounds. Both lumbar loads were well above the 1500 pound limit but the right seat results were encouraging in that they were well below the pilot's rigid seat data. Lumbar loads were not recorded for the second impact on either seat by either data system. There was no fuel spray from the fuel tanks. Fuel leaks were small and slow, well away from the engine compartment, and appear to have been from manufacturing flaws. 52</page><page sequence="9">Test 4 - The analysis described above and the test data from test 1 both show that the rear seat is subject to high acceleration during the second impact, "slap down", and that there is not enough stroke in the under floor energy absorber to attenuate the impact to the level required for a non stroking seat to limit the lumbar loads. Analysis shows the velocity of the rear seat at the second impact to be about 380 inches/sec. The stroke required to decelerate at a constant 20 g to zero velocity is 9.34 inches while the extended energy absorber only has a five inch stroke. Only about 3.5 inches stroke is available within the loft lines. It was thought that a combination of the extended energy absorber and a stroking rear seat could limit the lumbar loads to less than the allowed 1500 pounds. A JAARS "S" leg middle seat was acquired and mounted in the rear seat position (Figure 8) for test 4. This seat limited lumbar loads to less than 1500 pounds in sled tests to loading higher than the FAR 23.562, Test 1 requirements. While this seat is in use by two non- profit organizations, it is not commercially available. The pilot's seat was a developmental seat from a company which has since ceased operations. This seat was designed to meet the FAR 23.562 requirements when mounted over the main spar. The energy absorbing material was contained within the seat and the mounting was assumed to be rigid with respect to the airframe. It was planned to be adjustable fore and aft but was mounted to a steel framework fastened to the spar box for this test. The back angle was also adjustable but was fixed for this test. The restraint system was airframe mounted. The same copilot seat as used in the first two tests was used for tests 3 and 4. New energy absorbers were fabricated for each test with design (2 inches thick for these tests) of the energy absorbers based on sled test conducted at WSU for phase 1 of this project [8] Test 4 was planned as a repeat of test 1 with the addition of the rear seat and was conducted June 19, 1997. Impact attitude was at 26 degrees instead of the planned 30 degrees and impact velocity was 83.2 ft/sec. Roll and yaw were small. An impact sequence in shown in Figure 11. The windshield shattered at about 30 milliseconds after impact followed shortly by failure of the forward roll bar and side beams under the doors just aft of the forward edge of the door as shown in Figure 12. Both doors also came loose early. This allowed the forward fuselage to rotate upward approximately 12 degrees and the engine mount did not deform as much as predicted (Figures 13). Analysis had indicated the engine mount would collapse completely but the analysis did not allow for the forward fuselage failure, loss of the doors, or for the physical size of the engine and it's oil pan. This engine has a cast aluminum oil pan and the front portion was shattered by the impact. Forward mount brackets (portion attached to the engine) were broken but the aft brackets were intact. The mount did deform more than in test 1 and the deformation was more like that from the quasi-static tests. Figure 1 1 . Crash Sequence, Test 4 53</page><page sequence="10">Figure 12. Right Side Fuselage Beam There was no loss of cabin space and the deformation of the forward cabin was not enough to cause major damage to the legs of the front seat occupants. There was some fracturing of the slanted firewall segment on both sides but no penetration. There was no loss of structural integrity of the firewall at the braces near the floor but there was damage to the firewall beside the braces both above and below the cross tube as shown in Figure 14. There were bond line failures along the upper engine mount support beam and on both sides of the "Z" beam above the rear energy absorber. There was some failure of the side shear panels below the cross tube support angles and a number of other areas of failures of bond lines and fracturing of fibers in transition locations. Figure 13. Engine Mount Figure 14. Back Side of Firewall The aft fuselage failed in down bending and the stabilizer attachment failed on the second impact. These failures were neither unexpected or undesirable. Failures at this time reduce the energy available for rebound. The main wing spar lower cap failed by delaminatlon presumably on the second impact. The under floor energy absorbers did not show permanent deformation but the pictures indicate near full compression of them. The airplane did rebound into the air about one foot and out of contact with the ground for about 40 feet. It then stayed on the ground for the rest of the slide out. The airplane in test 1 had two rebounds but of less height. Accelerations at all locations were much lower than for test 1 including the tail post which was less than half that for test 1. The pilot's lumbar load was well under the 1 500 pound limit at about 1 1 00 pounds (Figure 1 5). Figure 15. Pilot Lumbar Load Figure 1 6. Copilot Lumbar Load Copilot's lumbar load was over the limit at near 1700 pounds (Figure 16) yet the under cushion energy absorber showed no permanent deformation. This is not understood since the same design had performed well in the sled tests at WSU. The foam material was from a different batch and it may be that there is enough variability from batch to batch to make the difference. There is a lot of high frequency hash on the pilot's pelvis accelerometer trace but changing the filter to delete this confirms that the pilot's pelvis had lower accelerations than the copilot's pelvis showing that the lumbar loads have the correct relationship. 54</page><page sequence="11">Lumbar loads for the rear seat passenger (Figure 17) were lower than expected, in fact, lower than tests for the same type seat in sled tests. NASA checked all the calibration factors after the test and could find no error. Figure 1 7. Rear Seat Passenger Lumbar Load It has been suggested that lumbar loads should be approximately 60 or 70 times the pelvis acceleration in g based on the weight of the portion of the body above the lumbar location. The first peak in lumbar load is approximately 60 times the acceleration but the second peak doesn't follow that relationship. The dummy leaned forward under the first impact and continued to move during the second impact. Some of the upper body weight was supported by the shoulder harness and the angle of the body and the motion of the body were relieving to lumbar loads. This is in contrast to sled tests for the FAR 23.562, Test 1 conditions where there is only one impact and the body has little forward motion. Harness loads were below the limit for all occupants and none of the occupants struck other structure. SOFT SOIL TESTS Test 2 - The second full scale test (first soft soil test) was conducted at the NASA Impact Dynamics Research Facility September 20, 1996. Design test parameters were test velocity of 81 feet/sec at 30 degree impact angle with zero angle of attack. Actual test conditions were 84 feet/sec with an angle of attack of approximately 2.7 degrees. Impact was on soft soil intended to replicate the soil characteristics of prior NASA tests [6-7] and of the Vá scale tests conducted for this project. An impact sequence in shown in Figure 18 and shows the airplane coming out of the crater at low speed coming to rest a short distance from the crater. The cowling and engine mount performed nearly as designed and very similar to the Vá scale tests, that is, the cowling maintained a sliding surface (Figure 19) and the engine mount deformed upward (Figure 20) to prevent the front of the airplane from simply sticking in the ground. Several engine components, such as oil cooler, magnetos, and starter, were closer to the mount posts than planned due to a somewhat idealized CAD model used in the design. These parts rotated up into the mount posts bending the posts as shown in Figure 20 so that energy was absorbed both in the lower part of the mount and in the posts. Figure 1 8. Crash Sequence, Test 2 55</page><page sequence="12">Figure 1 9. Cowl Figure 20. Engine Mount Design of the cowling incorporated an internal pad to prevent the engine and mount from penetrating the cowl and dig into the soft surface. Figures 21 shows the post crash cowl showing that the cowl maintained the sliding surface desired. Imprints of the forward engine mounts and some engine parts can be seen. The pad was four layers of 1/4 inch Nomex honeycomb with a single ply of fiberglass between layers. The cowling shell had been made before design of the cowl was complete and a skirt had to be added to extend the cowl to the slanted firewall surface. This made for a change in stiffness just forward of the firewall and the cowl broke on both sides at this location. This left a forward facing scoop but there was very little soil inside the cowling indicating this failure was late in the sequence. All accelerations were within the survivable range with the firewall longitudinal acceleration shown in Figure 22. Figure 21 . Inside Cowl Post Crash There was no loss of cabin volume. Both dummies hit the instrument panel because the pilot seat came loose at the rear attachments due to an installation error and the copilot shoulder harness Inertia reel bracket failed at about 3240 pounds. Shoulder harness force is limited to 2000 pounds in FAR 23 so it appeared a that a significant reduction in load for the harness was required. It can be determined from the pictures that the dummies were forward of the seat backs and there was some slack in the harnesses at impact. The airplane is suspended in an approximately 65 degree nose down position for several minutes in the pretest period. There were load cells on the harnesses and the weight of these cells tends to extend the harnesses and a slow motion of the belt won't lock the inertia reels. The dummies had been taped to the seats with tape fastened over the shoulder to the seat back. The tape was partially cut to initiate tearing at impact and it appears it may have released early. While the forward position of the dummies and slack in the harnesses may have contributed to the high harness loads, it was thought that a further reduction in harness loads was advisable for the next soft soil test. The measures taken will be described below. This test was thought to be survivable with minimal injuries assuming the seats and harnesses had worked properly. Figure 22. Lower Firewall Acceleration, X Soil was pushed forward by the forward part of the cowl but heavily compacted under the aft part of the cowling in our 1/2 scale tests. It did not appear to be this way after the full scale test. Airfield index tests [14] were run after the test both in the fuselage portion where soil appeared to have been pushed out of the crater and where the wing appeared to have compressed the soil. Readings were in the same range as before the test. We could find no evidence of soil compaction in the crater similar to that of the 1/2 scale tests. The crater depth was measured in a grid pattern and the volume of the crater integrated. Approximately 7 cubic feet of soil was ejected from the crater. Soil density measurements showed this soil to weigh about 80 pounds per cubic foot leading to the weight of soil ejected of 560 pounds or .224 times the weight of the test airplane. Figure 43, Volume III of Reference 5 gives the impulsive aircraft acceleration for these test conditions to be a little under 15g which is close to the data for the X axis. This tends to confirm that momentum exchange in ejecting soil from the crater is 56</page><page sequence="13">the primary factor in the X axis deceleration while the Z axis deceleration is probably the result of some combination of momentum exchange and energy absorption of the engine mount or airframe. Figure 23. Deployed Air Bag There was no visible deformation of the under floor energy absorbers in this test although test 4 shows that this may not mean there was no deformation. The airplane did not develop the angular velocity of the prior hard surface test. The right rear wing attach bolt failed allowing the right wing to swing well forward during the event. The left bolt was bent but did not release the wing. Fuel tanks did not rupture. Test 3 - Both dummies hit the instrument panel in the first soft soil test, one because of a seat attachment failure and one because of failure of the shoulder harness inertia reel attachment bracket. Two approaches were taken to improve restraint for the second soft soil test. An air bag was installed on the pilot's side and both shoulder harnesses had load limiters installed. In this way, there could be a direct comparison between the combination of air bag and load limiting and use of the load limiter alone. Both sides would see essentially the same loading since it was a symmetrical impact. Simula Technologies, Inc., provided a developmental air bag system for the third airplane drop test. The air bag system used in the test is a derivative of the Simula Passenger Air Bag System (PABS) developed for use in bulkhead rows for commuter aircraft. The air bag system used in the test consisted of two components: an air bag module mounted on the pilot's side instrument sub-panel, and a crash sensor mounted on the floor near the firewall. The sensor was mounted on the floor between the two braces near the center of the firewall behind the lower engine mount fittings. The copilot's position was tested without an air bag in order to provide comparative occupant data. The air bag module consisted of a molded plastic cover and metal housing from the PABS, a modified automotive driver-side air bag inflator, and an air bag designed specifically for this test. The assembled module measured approximately 2 inches deep by 6 inches wide by 7 inches tall and was mounted to the instrument sub- panel (represented by the wood 2x1 O's) by means of an adapter. The module weighed approximately 4 lb. Modules for a production air bag system could be integrated into an aircraft instrument panel or glare shield in the same manner as automotive passenger-side air bags are integrated into a car dashboard. Also, the packed size and shape of a production air bag module can be varied from the dimensions of the module used in this test in order to improve integration into the aircraft. The air bag itself was relatively small as shown in Figure 23, approximately 52 liters, which is similar in size to an automotive driver-side air bag. The shape, however, was a derivative of the air bag used in the PABS. Inflation of the air bag was provided by a conventional sodium azide automotive driver-side inflator specifically tailored for this test to insure proper air bag performance. The air bag inflation is initiated by an electrical signal coming from the crash sensor and the air bag fully deploys in about 50 ms. Because it is a derivative of the PABS, the air bag used in the test was vented. Vented air bags offer the advantage of rapid deflation, which is considered important for egress in transport and commuter aircraft. Non-vented air bags may be more appropriate in light aircraft, however, because non-vented bags remain inflated for several seconds to provide protection from secondary impacts. The crash sensor used in the drop test was borrowed from Simula's Inflatable Body and Head Restraint System (IBAHRS)-an inflatable shoulder harness developed for military helicopters. The IBAHRS sensor was used mainly because it was already at the NASA Langley facility for a previous AGATE drop test. A crash sensor similar to the one developed for PABS could be developed for a production light aircraft air bag system that would be lighter and less expensive than the IBAHRS sensor. The IBAHRS sensor weighs about 3 lb. A production crash sensor for a light aircraft air bag system would weigh less. The total air bag system weight for the test (air bag module, IBAHRS crash sensor, and wiring) was less than 8 lb. A two air bag production system integrated into the aircraft would likely weigh between 10 and 12 lb. There was no flight control system installed in the test airplane so the air bag could be installed without consideration of possible interference with controls. The production version of the test airplane is planned to have a side stick controller simplifying the task of preventing air bag and controls interference. Air bags are currently under development for military helicopters with control sticks and an inadvertent deployment without causing loss of flight control has been demonstrated successfully in simulators. More work is needed to determine the best way to install air bags with control wheels. 57</page><page sequence="14">Figure 24. Copilot's Load Limiter, Post Test The developmental restraint system included inertia reels and wire bending load limiters (Figure 24) which were designed to stroke at about 1600 to 1700 pounds. The load limiters were installed in the single strap between the inertia reel and the junction with the double shoulder straps. A bypass strap limited the extension to less than the wire bender stroke of about five inches. The third full scale test (second soft soil test) was conducted at the NASA Impact Dynamics Research Facility May 15, 1997. Design test parameters were test velocity of 81 feet/sec at 30 degree impact angle with zero angle of attack. Actual test conditions were 82.3 feet/sec with an angle of attack of approximately 6.5 degrees. Impact was on soft soil intended to replicate the soil characteristics of prior NASA tests [6-7] and in the Vz scale tests conducted for this project. Airfield Index measurements show the soil to be similar to the prior NASA tests near the surface but somewhat softer underneath. The impact sequence was similar to Test 2 shown in Figure 18 except that the airplane made a crater and then came out of the crater at low speed. It then slid off the soil bed and came to rest on the concrete surface. The crater depth was measured in a grid pattern and the volume of the crater integrated. Approximately 4.8 cubic feet of soil was ejected from the crater. Soil density measurements showed this soil to weigh about 80 pounds per cubic foot leading to the weight of soil ejected of 390 pounds or .155 times the weight of the test airplane. Figure 43, Volume III of Reference 5 gives the impulsive aircraft acceleration for these test conditions to be approximately 1 1 g. The data show two acceleration peaks approximating 20g with a central portion lower but above 1 1 g. The correlation between data and Figure 43 of Reference 5 is not as good as for test 2. As in test 2, airfield index readings were in the same range as before the test showing no evidence of soil compaction in the crater as was found in the Vz scale tests. Performance of the cowling and engine mount was similar to that of test 2 except that the forward portion of the engine mount broke free and remained attached to the engine as the engine was thrown forward away from the airframe. Strain gage data show that the engine mount absorbed energy for 140 to 160 milliseconds before breaking away and this time interval covered the primary event. Strain gage data from the posts indicate that the mount failure occurred as the airplane rotated up out of the crater which reverses loading on the engine mount. Several differences can be noted between test 3 and test 2 where the mount did not fail in this manner. Impact attitude was 3.9 degrees lower which was shown in the hard surface analysis to be a more severe impact. Engine mount post attachments to the upper rails had been moved aft one inch to increase engine accessories clearance and this nearly doubled the distance from the aft engine mount brackets to the post. The engine and accessories rotated upward bending the posts in test 2 which probably relieved loads in the rails. There was more clearance between the accessories and the mount in this test so the posts were not bent. The cowl worked well, similar to the cowl in test 2 except that it fractured where the forward portion of the pad met the central portion of the pad. The cowling pad for test 2 was made from honeycomb as described above and had a less abrupt intersection of the two portions of the pad. Foam was used for the pad on test 3 to allow use of wet lay-up fiberglass. Observation of the half scale tests showed the skirt of the cowl to be in compression and fastening the skirt to the belly skin is difficult with the energy absorbing foam in place so the skirt was not fastened to the belly for airplanes 3 and 4. Both wings broke forward because the fittings built into the rear spar pulled through the end of the spar. These fittings had aluminum inserts designed to increase bearing strength. The wing for test 3 was the same wing used in test 1 . This wing was refurbished to fix the visible damage prior to test 3 but it cannot be determined if there was prior damage to these fittings. It should be noted that test 1 on hard surface produced higher loads normal to the floor than parallel to the floor while test 3 on soft soil produced the opposite results. Upper main spar caps failed at the side of the fuselage while the lower spar caps separated from the web in what appeared to be a bond line failure, possibly with an incomplete bond. The slanted floor of the firewall was fractured toward the outside edges but was not penetrated so the foot space was not compromised. The air bag, shown deployed in Figure 23, appeared to work as designed. Film from the internal cameras show that the bag was fully inflated before the dummy contacted the bag. There was no head impact on any hard surface but the head data were lost because the instrument wires pulled out of the connector. Two particularly impressive results were that there was little pilot motion after initial impact compared to the copilot where there was considerable flailing during the slide out and there was much less head and neck motion. 58</page><page sequence="15">The load limiter on the pilot's shoulder belt stroked about 1 inch while the copilot's (Figure 24) stroked about 1.75 inches with the difference thought to be a result of the air bag for the pilot. The copilot flailed during the slide out apparently because the inertia reel released after the initial impact. His head hit the subpanel when the airplane hit the concrete surface. HIC was calculated to be less than 900 where 1000 is considered to be the threshold of injury. The lighter, less labor intensive airframe designed for the third and fourth airframes worked well for this test, as well as the heavier airframe worked for test 2. Both the air bag and load limiters appeared to have positive benefits for this crash scenario. The load limiter kept the occupant loads below limits but allowed more head and upper body motion than the combination of air bag and load limiter. The combination of air bag and load limiter would be expected to reduce neck injury potential due to head motion. The restraint systems should resist occupant motion during secondary aircraft motions after the initial impact. This was a survivable test with minimal injuries expected. SUMMARY OF RESULTS These tests indicate that improved survivability is possible, compared to prior NASA tests of conventional airplanes, for symmetrical impacts at approximately stall speed for this class of airplanes for a relatively severe impact angle onto both hard and soft soil surfaces. The airframe weight penalty is approximately 50 pounds with air bags adding another 12 pounds and load limiting shoulder harnesses an additional 1 pound. No single feature was responsible for the improved survivability, rather the combined effects of all the features discussed were required for the full benefits. The same airframe design is suitable for both hard surface and soft soil impacts. Dynamic conditions can't be simulated in quasi-static testing. Subscale static testing can help understand failure and energy absorbing patterns. Subscale soil testing was particularly valuable in understanding soil impact behavior. Absorbing energy in the engine mount, rather than in the cabin structure, increases accelerations at the rear seat for hard surface impacts by moving the ground reactions farther from the center of gravity. This leads to a second impact as the airplane rotates tail down with the strength of the second impact increasing aft. Rear seat loading is higher than front seat loading for this class of airplane during this second impact. Soft soil impacts have longitudinal loads higher than normal loads with the reverse being true for hard surface impacts. Both air bags and shoulder harness load limiters proved beneficial for the soft soil impacts. Loads applied at the seat tracks were higher than FAR 23.562 certification loads. Analysis indicates seat accelerations increase as impact attitude decreases for the same flight path angle and velocity. Off axis impacts were not tested or analyzed. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. An inexpensive method for the dynamic testing of materials and components needs to be developed and made available to the industry. 2. An inexpensive method for the dynamic testing of configurations, full or subscale, needs to be developed and made available to the industry. 3. The analysis should be extended to include seats, occupants, and restraint systems, three dimensional structures, soil impact, and off axis impacts. 4. These results have shown that survivability can be improved but it is clear that impact energy can exceed the design limits of any reasonable energy absorbing system. Further, the number of impact scenarios is infinite. Crashworthiness standards need to be developed that are achievable, reasonable, and that can be applied without full scale airplane impact testing. 5. While not a technical topic, some change in the product liability climate needs to be made that does not penalize companies or individuals for conducting crashworthiness research and development and for making product improvements.
