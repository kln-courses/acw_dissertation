<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENTER TEXTUALITY: ECHOES FROM THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL THOMAS A. SEBEOK Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies, Indiana Jorge Luis Borges once observed that every writer of fiction creates his own precursors by modifying each of his reader's conceptions of the past. The same retrospective axiom surely constrains every other sort of text fabricant, from scientist to, in the case in point, cinematic auteur. For purposes of this presentation, a "text" will be regarded as any significant object, or, more technically, as any autonomously blended string of signs. Although the internal simplicity or complexity such a string may display is not at issue here, multistranded strings tend to be more fascinating than single filaments, and syncretic aggregations - of which film offers a conspicuous example - even more so. The Janus-faced concept of "intertextuality," which, in contrast with Borges's dictum, works as much prospectively as it does in a retrograde scape - by extension of M. Bachtin's original, although hardly precise, formulation of heteroglossia, dialogism, and polyphony - denotes ways in which works of art - especially of literature - are produced in response not to social reality but to previous works of art and the codes and other conventions governing them. In J. Kristeva's reformulation: "tout texte se construit comme mosaique de citations, tout texte est absorption et transformation d'un autre text. A la place de la notion d'intersubjectivite s'installe celle d'intertextualit~.. ." (1969:146). Intertextual codes, which R. Barthes characterized (1974:10) as a "mirage of citations," are ultimately insubstantial, every reader having become a more or less representative embodiment of a vague, generalized intertextuality; as he went on to write in the same work: "Ce 'moi' qui s'approche du texte est deji lui-meme une pluralit6 d'autres textes, de codes infinis, ou plus exactement: perdus (dont I'origine se perd)" (p. 16). To the degree to which a work of art is "intertextual," it becomes distorted, opaque even, a darkly specular reflection of actuality - as, Poetics Today, Vol. 6:4 (1985) 657-663</page><page sequence="2">658 THOMAS SEBEOK for instance, a myth. It becomes a lattice of signposts, regressing into, effectively, infinity, and thus capable of sustaining many alternative interpretations. Yet it may become a dialectical (versus sequential) tool for furthering the study of typological goals far more tellingly than the more indeterminate conception of "influence," and, as such, may assume various shapes, including, notably, allegorical. I once argued (Sebeok 1979:xiii), modifying Samuel Butler's famous brocard about a hen and an egg, that a sign is only a sign's way of making more signs. I learned only recently that B.F. Skinner made an analogous claim, "that a poet is only a literary tradition's way of making more of a literary tradition, and ... that a scientist is only science's way of making more science" (1983:30). It is in line with these views that all texts must be regarded as "intertextual," although, of course, variations, by definition, do occur on all levels. These are the mechanisms for increasing information, the measure of novelty, with the passage of the ages. In 1859, Charles Darwin instructed the readership of his Origin of Species that "all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch," and we now have an impressive body of evidence that the direct-filiation hypo- thesis, as it has since come to be called (Margulis 1981:37), applies universally to the patterns of evolution of all animals and plants, indeed of all genomes; (true, the evolution of eukaryotes from prokaryotes seems to require the invocation of an additional principle of symbiosis, but, even so, the combined effects lead to the formation of precisely the same phylogenies). Note that the concept of "intertextuality," with its actual or implied groping for ultimate codes whose origins are lost, postulates a body of discourse assumed already to be in place, and thereby allows for the creation of the works in posse, envisaging the signifying practices of texts to be produced by some future weaver of yet another text. In fact, it is a tacit extension into the cultural sphere of the canon of direct filiation, so well recognized in the domain of our biosphere. If, as Peirce taught, man is a sign, or a text (Sebeok 1979:60f.; 1981:6), then each and every one of us is the "intertextual" product, in quite a literal sense, of myriad prior biochemical developments and innumerable precursors - minimal self-replicating entities, leading to polygenomic cells - that populated the Earth since the common ancestors of life, more than three billion years ago, arose from organic compounds on the surface of our planet, organizing themselves into macromolecular systems of signs capable of storing and transmitting information. In this paper, I propose to examine Steven Spielberg's artful and entrancing transfiguration of the archetypally familiar boy-and-his- pet story (the everyday carnal) into a sci-fi fantasy (the mythic supernal), as enacted in "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial," and attempt</page><page sequence="3">ENTER TEXTUALITY 659 to decipher how the unfamiliar trappings, transcendental reverberations, and subliminal currents thereof come into focus in consequence of a consistent application of intertextual techniques and effects (the ddjd-vu, as well as the dejd-lu, and even the dejli- entendu). The march of variegated visual and auditory metonyms - disembodied footsteps and jangling keys, unoccupied moving swings and toy soldiers, ominous breathing and musical notes, Reese's Pieces and clinical charts - which, together, and more, constitute the organizing pith of the picture, its energetic armature, if you will, is punctuated by Elliott's and E.T.'s ligamentary emblematic geranium: it wilts, but, in the end, it re-effloresces in its pot. The tropes are carefully balanced out on multiple planes, one of which is cast in a botanical idiom. The visitors, who touch down on a California forest clearing, densely begirded by tall trees and lush foliage, are back, we learn, on a plant-gathering field trip. As the crew of this peaceable expedition is about to be captured by depersonalized but ill-boding government agents, the aliens take off in their pumpkin-shaped spaceship - the film's texture is ingrained with carnivalesque images of, particularly, Halloween and Christmas - inadvertently abandoning one of their kind. The focal meaning of the geranium was underscored by Kotzwinkle (1982:183), who wrote a novel based on Melissa Mathison's screen- play, as he ends the book with this pregnant sentence: "He went into the misty light, with his geranium." The marooned "old botanist" (an epithet sometimes used to characterize E.T.), is left shuffling through the grass as the ship's hatch shuts, petals folding inward. He finds his way to the vegetable garden of Elliot and his family, rounded out by a teenage brother, a younger sister, and their mother, lately singled, dad having taken off for Mexico with Sally, a girlfriend. The lonesome alien, yearning for his home, three million light-years distant, and the fatherless (i.e., "alienated") boy, are united by a natural bond of companionship. The movie is obviously a direct, although undeclared, continuation of Spielberg's "Close Encounters." P. Kael (1982:119) remarked that "that's partly because [this film] has the sensibility we came to know in that picture, and partly because E.T. himself is like a more corporeal version of the celestial visitors at the end of it." The link, moreover, is nonverbally signaled by John Williams's variations on an unmistakable theme, the scores serving to enhance both scripts as well as those of the tripartite "Star Wars" saga released so far. With palpable deliberation, Spielberg intersows self-references to his own and kindred previous works. During the Halloween scene, among the costumed children fanning out to go haunting, there is a little figure dressed up as Yoda, the gnostic gnome</page><page sequence="4">660 THOMAS SEBEOK introduced in "The Empire Strikes Back." E.T., an "old monster" now in ghostly disguise, turns his head in recognition of the Jedi, along with the complicit members of the audience, as a colleague who has, as it were, strayed into this picture from a neighboring set. "Jaws" puts in a brief synecdochical appearance in the guise of a scoop in Elliott's fish tank, while the tub of live frogs he liberates during a biology class to prevent the chloroforming and dissection of these Kermit-like creatures - themselves reminiscent of the eye- boggling apparition of the extra-terrestrial ("Are you a Muppet?" Elliott's sister, Gertie, asks) - evokes the episode featuring Marion, the heroine in the snakepit, from the "Raiders of the Lost Ark," underlined by a comic shot of a schoolmate of Elliott's standing as if she were paralyzed in midst of the pandemonium of escaping frogs crawling over hands and feet. The climactic big chase sequence, the children and the space-goblin fleeing military vehicles on bicycles that sometimes fly high in the sky, by application of a low-level anti- gravity formula, recalls several high-powered cliff-hanger pursuits from the same 1981 film and similar tricky effects from still earlier Spielberg productions (notably, "The Duel"). The contrast between the sophisticated military vehicles and other lethal equipment at the disposal of the uniformed members of the search party - their space- travel gear, especially their gleaming head masks, bring to mind the terror of Darth Vader in carapace and his undifferentiated metallic troops - with the kids' ordinary yet bewitched bikes, is nearly captured as Elliott and "the ancient fugitive" soar in the dusk against the moonlight. This remarkable shot is another icon of Halloween, and one that instantly made me think of the Good Witch from '"The Wizard of Oz," with which the film shares still further implicit but deep figurations (as it does, if more tangentially, with "Meet Me in St. Louis"). In preparing for Halloween, by the way, Mary, Elliott's mother, actually plays the Good Witch: looking beautiful, like a star-creature, she carries a star-wand to touch trick-or-treaters on the head. "E.T." shares paradigmatic qualities perhaps most explicitly with J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, passages from which are read aloud in the movie. Tink's dying and getting well again if children do and declare that they believe in fairies - E.T. himself avers his belief - prefigures the extra-terrestrial's own revival. Such intertextual lineages are, I believe, rooted in Spielberg's sensibility; they could easily be traced out further: to Robinson Crusoe, for example (Kotzwinkle 1982:125), or Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel (again, the Reese's Pieces), and selected passages from the imagination of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.1 Although 1. Several auditors of this lecture have called my attention to a scene where E.T. hides from the children's mother in a toy-filled closet. As she opens the closet door, he blends so well</page><page sequence="5">ENTER TEXTUALITY 661 Spielberg supplied the idea for the picture, the screenplay was developed by three writers, among them Melissa Mathison, who was one of the scenarists for Carroll Ballard's 1979 film, "The Black Stallion." She is probably responsible for the emphatic development of the boy-and-his-pet theme, sparked by Walter Farley's 1941 novel, which inseminated numberless sequels. She also seems fond of lonesome boys who are bereft of their father, a motif that is auto- biographically congenial to Spielberg as well. The fatherless ten-year-old Elliott and his forsaken unearthly familiar are, however, much more than friends. In a profound sense, they are identical, as the boy's very name, EllioT, insinuates. Communication between the two of them progresses rapidly from sign language to Earth language ("the language center of his marvelous brain came fully on, a thousand stored tongues reappearing, as reference and cross-reference took place, so that Earth's language could be viewed in the round. He grasped its fundamentals, and then its delicate edges" [Kotzwinkle 1982:75]). It continues via two-way telepathic communications. When E.T. gets plastered on a six-pack of beer at home while his telepathic sender is in full force, Elliott suffers bizare effects in school, along with the loaded source. When E.T. - who, by the way, is constituted of DNA like all the rest of us - becomes mortally sick, Elliott does so in analogous fashion, as reflected by electronic scanners and displays. Kotzwinkle comments: "The boy and the monster were linked somehow, as if the monster were feeding on the child's life. The child came in and out of consciousness, hallucinating, babbling, sinking under again. I'd cut the cord that ties them, thought the doctor, if only I knew where and what it was" (1982:167). E.T., of course, recovers ("Do you believe in fairies?"), and so does Elliott; the wilted geranium blooms again, simultaneously. The "intertextual" pedigree of "E.T.," traced out so far to literary, filmic, musical, and autobiographical lines of descent, crisscrossing but controlled in a highly craftsmanlike manner by the omnipresent director, must be regarded as a pattern that works only skin-deep. Notwithstanding the fact that these interwoven elements of its surface structure may suffice to convey the gratification derived from wonted up-beat narrative constituents distanced by exotic trappings, they do not by themselves, I think, account for either the genuinely tearful cathartic enchantment many viewers report experiencing during this movie, nor its record-breaking box with the dolls that she fails to notice him. I am told that this sequence is intended to recall a mirthful pause in Chaplin's "The Circus," which opened in 1928, but which I have never seen. The sequence is briefly described by Huff (1951:213) thus: "Charlie freezes into a wooden statue among other figures on a Noah's Ark, as the cop dashes past." The principle involved, in both cases, is, of course, that of Poe's "The Purloined Letter."</page><page sequence="6">662 THOMAS SEBEOK office success. These must be ascribed to the archetypally subliminal religious infrastructure in which the film is soaked. It is thus turned into a calculated yet unpretentious allegory. Before ascending to this level of inspection, however, it might be worth pointing briefly to yet another reason for E.T.'s lachrymose allurement. The physical design and traits of E.T. enable us to descry him as an idealized bundle of what ethologists call biological "releasers." Although, to be sure, E.T. is not actually an animal, he is, as mentioned, a very special pet of Elliott's, exemplifying to perfection Morris's (1967:230) first law of animal appeal, which states that "The popularity of an animal is directly correlated with the number of anthropomorphic features it possesses." E.T. does so, in superoptimal degree. A preternatural creature descends to the Earth from his unearthly orb, inscribed with a delicate gothic design ("as if an enormous Christmas tree ornament had fallen from the darkness . . . the greatest heart-light the world has ever seen," Kotzwinkle 1982:182). He is found in a tool shed, arguably a suburban Southern California rendition of a manger. He is adopted and protected by a family, the mother of which is named Mary; (it is, incidentally, worth noting that Mary is the sole adult female in the picture, like Princess Leia Organa was in "Star Wars"). The visitor proceeds to perform magical deeds, like making mundane balls float in the air and rotate in orbit. He executes wonderful healings and levitations. Indeed, his presence is referred to several times as "miraculous." Love is the message E.T. brings to Earth, and, among the Earthlings, it is the children he attracts as his immediate disciples. He is hounded and persecuted by sinister legions of faceless pursuers, undergoes suffering, death, resurrection, and, at last, ascension, to his home. Holding on to his geranium, he embraces Elliott, and delivers an intricate wave-sign of benediction, "to release the child from the narcosis of the stars" (Kotzwinkle 1982:182). "I'll be right here," he finally pronounces, as his luminous fingertip glows over the boy's chest. We, who are left behind, can look forward to a Second Coming. REFERENCES Barthes, Roland, 1970.

POSTSCRIPT Fourteen months after I finished this essay, I had an opportunity to view, at a private showing, but only once, a minor, and, I think I could show why, flawed Spielberg movie, "Poltergeist," which was released at approximately the same time as "E.T." Note that the central theme of each of these three films is semiosis: "Close Encounters" deals with successful communication achieved between superior extraterrestrials ("from above") and humans, played off against a lack of successful familial intercourse among earthlings. "Poltergeist," by contrast, deals with failed communication between inframundane, undead creatures ("from beneath") and the members of a stable family, which, however, has been hornswoggled by the father's employer; the would-be exorcist, moreover, turns out to have failed. "E.T." lands "from above" amidst a disturbed family, but leaves those "beneath" fully restored; the success of this film surely has its roots in the satisfaction sensed by the audience at its mediational footing at that stage in the Spielberg opera. Incidentally, I was, again, struck by Spielberg's obsessive self- referentiality; e.g., at the very outset, he unmistakably alludes, both verbally and nonverbally, to "Star Wars" and "Jaws," as well as to "E.T." At times, it seemed that "Poltergeist" shared with "E.T." the same scenery and some of the gimmickry left over from "Close Encounters" or "E.T." His continuing preoccupation with the imagery of "The Wizard of Oz" did not surprise me, but the cross- references to Hitchcock - such as the portentous renvoi to '"The Birds," and a misplaced, insufficiently developed evocation of "Psycho" - did.</page></plain_text>
