<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Mexico expels distinguished anthropologist on trumped-up charges MEXICO CITY (La Jornada). On May 15, 1998, German cultural anthropologist Ulrich Köhler of the Department of Anthropology, University of Freiburg, was thrown out of Mexico after he presented copies of a book to the Presidencia Municipal and the Casa de la Cultura of the Tzotzil Commu nity of Pantelho in the highlands of Chiapas. The book was an ethnography of Pantelho, written in the years preceding by Ulrich Köhler and a group of his students. Presenting the book to the Community of Pantelho was an act of courtesy and respect. On his way back from Pantelho to San Cristóbal de las Casas, in the village of Chenalho, Ulrich Köhler was forced out of the public bus by employées of the Immigration Department. His tourist card was confiscated and he was subjected to a two-day interrogation. Finally, he was accused of having written "publicaciones (tanto) en este país como en el extranjero, sin autorización expresa de esta secretaría (de Gobernación)." He was forced to pay a fee of 1,000 pesos and to leave the country immediately. Ulrich Köhler has spent 35 years conducting research in Mexico, in particular on Tzotzil communities in Chiapas. His scientific work has received international récognition. His books and articles have been published in Mexico, the United States and Europe. Two of his books, Chonbilal Ch'ulelal (UNAM 1995) and Cambio cultural dirigido en los Altos de Chiapas (INI 1975) have been published in Spanish by Mexican institutions. His work is dedicated exclusively to cultural anthropology, oral traditions and cultural change. Since Ulrich Köhler did not conduct any research in May, the confiscation of his tourist card was a violation of Mexican law. Furthermore, the publications were written before Mexico's notorious law of censorship became effective (October 19, 1993), which prohibits any publication about Mexico by foreigners without the prior consent of the Ministerio de Gobernación. Even though Mexican and European colleagues have publically protested the expulsion of Ulrich Köhler, there has been no officiai reaction on the part of the increasingly xénophobie Mexican government. Visas to be denied to foreign scholars seeking to work in, or even visit, Mexico's predominantly Indian states MEXICO CITY (La Jornada). There are other signs that Mexico's thoroughly discredited PRI regime no longer wel comes foreign anthropologists, an attitude stemming largely from an unwillingness to have foreigners witness, and - worse still - report on, human rights violations against Indian communities, such as by the Mexican army and the local PRI dictatorship in Chiapas. According to information provided by the Mexican Embassy in Bonn and the Mexican General Consulate in Hamburg, no visas are to be issued anymore for any activities in federal states with an appréciable Indian population. As a conséquence, a long-planned field school in Guerrero by the University of Hamburg cannot be set up. In addition, the Visa Department of the Mexican Embassy has confirmed that ail scholars who intend to give public lectures or particípate in scientific symposia or Conferences need an "FN-3" visa. Tourist cards cannot be used any longer for attendance of Conferences, even if invitations by Mexican universities or INAH are presented. The new, repressive Mexican politics toward foreign scholars will have serious conséquences for scientific coopération and for Mexico's already gravely diminished international réputation. In Ger many, the Department of Foreign Affairs has been called on in order to establish clear guidelines and rules for future research. In the meantime, cultural anthropologists should beware of taking part in activities of any kind in Mexico and are asked not to particípate in congresses, meetings or other forms of scientific exchange which would require their prés ence in Mexico. mexicon • Vol. XX August 1998</page><page sequence="2">Mexican anthropologists protest xénophobie measures undertaken by the PRI regime who committed suicide a week after the break-in.

The symposium will focus on the "conservation of the architecture of the 20th Century" and will take place in the Faculty of Architecture at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in Mexico City, from October 20 to 24, 1998. The Maya ruins of Nakeb, Yucatan GRAZ (Karl H. Mayer). On March 27,1998 two members of the mexicon editorial staff, Stephan Merk and Karl Herbert Mayer, together with Susanne Schlegel, University of Bonn, and guided by Oswaldo Navarrete from the town of Muna, visited an archaeological site, Nakeb, in the Puuc Zone of the Mexican State of Yucatan, NW of the ruins of Uxmal. Schlegel had visited the site a few days before, accompanied by Navarrete. More than 500 m north of the ruins is a large, locally well-known aguada, named Chimez Akal. The site has obviously not been published previously. The exact geographical location of the ruins were established with a hand-held GPS navigator that gave the following readings: latitude 20° 24.03' N, longitude 89° 50.09' W; this places Nakeb 8 km NW of Uxmal (latitude 20° 21.52' N, longitude 89° 46.29' W), as the parrot flies. The access to the ruins from Uxmal is relatively easy. Nakeb consists essentially of two small architectural groups, the Central Group and the Northeast Group, which are approximately 40 m apart. The Central Group is domi nated by a pyramid, now a large mound; at its eastern side are Fig. 2. Interior of Structure I at Nakeb (Photo: Karl H.

To the west of the pyramid are the remains of a multi-room structure, originally rooms, there remains a relatively well-preserved room with a perhaps featuring four rooms; some wall sections and vault fallen, single doorway facing east (Fig. 1). The building with portions are still preserved.

In January 1998, the Museo del Fuego Nuevo (Museum of the New Fire Ceremony) was inaugurated. The muséum is lo cated on the plateau of the Cerro de la Estrella in the déléga tion of Iztapalapa, Mexico City. It was constructed with the objective of restoring the important Prehispanic ritual in Mesoamerica and recovering the important site known as a place where ancient Mexicans used to honour the sun. In the new muséum 160 archaeological objects are on display. Among them are projectile points, vessels for domestic and ceremonial use, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, malacates, metates and musical instruments. The objects are finds by people who live in the surroundings of the Cerro de la Estrella. Also, the muséum exhibits marquettes that repre Fig. 4. Sculpture fragment at Nakeb (Photo: Karl H.
