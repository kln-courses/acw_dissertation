FORUM Ghosts in the Machine "Ghosts in the Machine" an exhibition recently on view at the New Museum in New York City, surveys the constantly shifting relationship between humans, machines, and art. It examines artists' embrace of and fascination with technology, as well as their prescient awareness of the ways in which technology can transform subjective experience. International in scope, "Ghosts in the Machine" spans more than fifty years and incorporates works by a range of historical figures and contemporary artists from fifteen countries. Together, the works trace the complex journey from the mechanical to the optical to the virtual, looking at the ways in which humans have projected anthropomorphic behaviors onto machines and how those machines have become progressively more human. Eschewing a traditional chronological approach, "Ghosts in the Machine" was conceived as an encyclopedic cabinet of wonders, bringing together an array of artworks and non-art objects to create an unsystematic archive of humans' attempt to reconcile the organic and the mechanical. The exhibition features artists, writers, and visionaries whose works have explored the fears and aspirations generated by the technology of their time. From Jacob Mohr's influencing machines to Emery Blagdor√Øs healing constructions, the exhibition brings together improvised technologies charged with magical powers. Historical works by Hans Haacke, Robert Breer, and Otto Piene, among others, are displayed alongside reconstructions of lost works and realizations of dystopian mechanical devices invented by figures like Franz Kafka. "Ghosts in the Machine" takes its cue from a number of exhibitions designed by artists that incorporated modern technology to reimagine the role of art in contemporary societies, including Richard Hamilton's "Man, Machine and Motion" (1955). Exploring the integration of art and science, "Ghosts in the Machine" identifies an art historical lineage of works preoccupied with the way we imagine and experience the future, delineating an archeology of visionary dreams that have never become a reality. Many of the artists in the show take a scientific approach to investigating the realm of the invisible, dismantling the mechanics of vision in order to conceive new possibilities for seeing. Central to the exhibition is a re-examination of Op art and perceptual abstraction. Op art was unique in the way it internalized technology and captured both the ecstatic and threatening qualities it posed to the human body. Furthermore, the exhibition includes a number of kinetic and "programmed" artworks as well as expanded cinema pieces, which amplify the radical effects of technology on vision. A section of the exhibition presents a selection of experimental films and videos realized with early computer technology. As technology has accelerated and proliferated dramatically over the past twenty years, artists have continued to monitor its impact. A number of contemporary artists, including Philippe Parreno, are represented in the exhibition. These recent works, while reflecting technological changes, also display a fascination with earlier machines and the types of knowledge and experiences that are lost as we move from one era to the next, constantly dreaming up new futures that will never arrive.
