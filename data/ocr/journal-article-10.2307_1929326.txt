<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SUGGESTION TO AMEND CERTAIN FAMILIAR ECOLOGICAL TERMS In the course of a recent conversation one of the undersigned recalled that a speaker at the Kansas City meeting of the Ecological Society had made use of the phrase " xero- phytic animal." Consideration of this absurdity led to the realization that many of the ways in which we use the adjectives " xerophytic," " hydrophytic" and " mesophytic " are unjustifiable. We are accustomed, for example, to speak of a " xerophytic habitat," which, literally translated, signifies a " dry-habitat-plant habitat "-a ridiculous circum- locution. There is the further objection that the term applies solely to the plant popula- tion, without regard to the animal contingent in the community. A " xerophytic struc- ture," strictly interpreted, is a " dry-habitat-plant structure," at the best a roundabout expression of the facts we are attempting to present. The phrase "xerophytic species " is not open to serious objection perhaps, so far as plants are concerned, but is of course inapplicable to animals, and there is no corresponding term to take its place. Possessing the noun " xerophyte," the phrase " xerophytic plant " is unnecessary and redundant. 389</page><page sequence="2">390 NOTES AND COMMENT Ecology, Vol. VII, No. 3 " Xerophilous " and its companion terms are free from the objections noted, but, on the other hand, they are objectionable in their connotation of anthropomorphism. In order to bring about a closer agreement between expression. and signification, and especially to provide terms which shall be applicable to both plants and animals, we sug- gest that the adjectives " xerophytic," " hydrophytic " and " mesophytic " be entirely abandoned as useless and misleading. In their place we offer the terms " xeric," " hydric and " mesic," to be defined as follows: Xeric (hydric, mesic) : characterized by or pertaining to conditions of scanty (abun- dant, medium) moisture supply. These adjectives seem to be equally applicable to nouns denoting habitat, structure or organism. The terms " xerophyte," " hydrophyte " and " mesophyte " should of course be retained in their accustomed uses. W. S. COOPER UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA A. 0.
