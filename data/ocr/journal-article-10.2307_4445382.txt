<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION, by Paul R. Ehrlich, Richard W. Holm, and Dennis R. Parnell. 2nd ed., 1974. McGraw-Hill Book Co. (1221 Ave. of Americas, New York 10020). 378 p. $13.95 hardback. This is a significant book-an au- thoritative composite of scientific data and reasoned reflection on the evolu- tionary process. Readers familiar with the earlier (1963) edition will be pleased to discover that this edition incorpor- ates modern research findings through- out and includes many new discussions and perspectives while retaining the distinct intelligence of its predecessor. Although the book is ideally suited for use in evolution courses, especially at advanced levels, it seems likely that it will also be widely used as a source book by natural and social scientists who require an up-to-date assessment of educated thought on the "grand syn- thesis." Ranging from balanced polymor- phism to the evolution of culture, an ad- mirably complete list of topics is treated-and with a succinctness of style that is rare. Remarkably, the effi- ciency of the prose does not sacrifice clarity. In a few instances, some topics (neotony, for example) seemed to need expansion, and several discussions could probably have benefited from a looser, more rambling exposition; but, generally, this book contains more in- formation than many others twice its length. The most laudable feature of this work is, however, not its structure, style, or amount of data but probably its sophistication of thought. The au- thors are aware throughout of the dan- gers of compartmentalization and the perceptual limits that labels impose. They know the ease with which truth is lost and that creative reasoning is sti- fled by rigid definition of the myopia of teleology and anthropomorphism. Discussions are refreshingly un- hampered by time-worm stereotypes and certainties. A thoughtful, reflective objectivity is characteristic. The reader is frequently stimulated to probe the logic of principles described and is often made aware of the mental processes by which conclusions are reached. The book admirably separates evident fact from hypothesis and both from accul- turated assumptions and biases. Specu- lation by the authors on causes and sig- nificance of phenomena discussed is continuous and very useful inasmuch as opinions are always identifiable as such. Biological verities, whether re- garding the structure of DNA or the characteristics of population, are never treated as static. The authors in fact describe the basic properties of life as themselves products of an evolutionary process. It has long been recognized that evo- lutionary theory represents the great- est unifying construct ever developed in biology. It is gratifying to have avail- able such an intelligent guide to the subject. Thomas L. Shellberg Henry Ford Community College Dearborn, Mich.</page></plain_text>
