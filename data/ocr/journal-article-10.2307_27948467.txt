Collecting indigenous art objects and removing them from their country of origin is a questionable practice in today's so ciety, but no matter one's political or scholarly views of such activities, collections of this kind allow the viewer an historical perspective often not possible when viewing the objects in their original locations. The art of collection also creates questions for the viewer. What is it about an object that makes it important to the collector? Why are some objects selected rather than others? Are there intrinsic qualities about the collection of objects that make the collection important as an entity? These and other questions are brought to mind when examining The Intelligence of Forms. The book documents the collecting efforts of Belgian art ist Jean Willy Mestach, who, over a period of 40 years, assembled one of the finest African sculpture collections in Belgium, a country with many avid collectors of central African art. In the late 19th century, the indigenous peoples of central Africa came under Belgian control in what became known as the Belgian Congo. The Royal Museum for Central Africa, in Ter vuren, stands as the acknowledged center for the study of Zairian art and presents unparalleled collections of natural his tory and ethnography. Along with this fine museum collection, Belgium is home to numerous scholars, collectors, and dealers specializing in African art. Willy Mestach, artist, collector, writer, and philosopher, is among those living in the Sablon, the art center of Brussels. In Mestach's home the visitor will find the artist's own artwork mingled with his extraordinary collection of African objects. Mestach, born in 1926, grew up with an eclectic collection of art objects and antiques from China and Europe. He was ex posed to African art by visiting the Royal Museum and vividly recalls his first larger-than-life encounters with African sculp ture. He officially began collecting at the age of 17 when he bought an Egyptian ushabti figure for about 50 cents. Mestach began his professional career as a graphic designer and illustrator but turned to his own work in 1951. It was then that he began his close association with African art. He began studying the sculptural geometric representations of the human form as they related to his own work. Taking a cue from Picasso, Mestach explored the African sculptural tradition of construct ing three-dimensional forms from interrelated geometric units. Mestach deconstructed the sculptural volumes of African figures into two-dimensional graphic representations by using an ab stract system of lines. In 1984 Mestach began working three dimensionally with much of the work being an anthropomorph ization of found objects such as musical instruments or instru ment cases. The work visually and conceptually relates directly to many of the objects found in Mestach's collection. The Intelligence of Forms is composed of three parts: the first, a biographical essay by Evan Maurer, director of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts; the second, a collection of writings about collec tive memory and art by Willy Mestach; and the third, the cata logue of Mestach's collection. The initial biographical essay by Maurer reveals a great deal about the artist and provides excel lent background for the rest of the book. Details of Mestach's life, art, and motivations are provided. Illustrations include photo graphs of his two-dimensional and three-dimensional works as well as portraits of Mestach by other artists and photographs of his studio and apartment. The collection of Mestach's writings is</page><page sequence="2">156 Art Documentation, Fall 1992 intriguing and communicates Mestach's personal relationship with art and with the objects he deems significant and has col lected. The writings were translated from the original French that is included near the end of the book. The catalogue of Mestach's collection is organized to reflect Mestach's aesthetic and cultural point of view. He believes that objects gain value from their association and relationship to other objects. Mes tach's comments about the objects are included in the catalogue. While the collection is predominantly from Africa, there are also objects from Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Following the catalogue is a map showing the origins of the objects, the original French writings of Mestach, and a bibliography. While this book is about Mestach as an artist and about the objects he has collected over the years, it is also about the way in which disparate parts of a person make up the whole. Mestach's art is central to him as a person, but no less so than his writing or his collecting. Much is revealed about Mestach by examining the objects he has selected and feels are significant. It is the art of collecting that is used here as a window into Mestach's being. The Intelligence of Forms is beautifully produced with high quality illustrations and informative text. The value of this work lies not with the documentation of indigenous art but with the examination of the relationship between the art of collecting and the artist. Patrons may select this work because the photographs of the objects are clear and good, but hopefully they will explore the entire work and enjoy the complexities of Willy Mestach. This will be a worthwhile purchase for academic, public, and museum libraries. Mary Molinaro University of Kentucky, Lexington</page></plain_text>
