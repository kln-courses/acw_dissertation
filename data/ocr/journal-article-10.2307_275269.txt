<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE SCIENCES OF ANTHROPOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY Not only every archaeologist, but every school child knows what the his- torical divisions: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, mean. They are used in all our school books to denote early stages of man's culture. Very few people know that these divisions originate with Christian J. Thomsen, the first Di- rector of the National Museum of Copenhagen, Denmark. He first used these divisions in his works, thus laying the foundations for modern research, and they have since become part of our daily language. Every archaeologist has, in one or another book, found the word: kikken- modding, or in English: kitchen-midden. The study of kitchen-middens also originated with the staff of the National Museum in Copenhagen. The study of stratification and many other methods of archaeological investigation had their birthplace in Denmark, and we have enlarged and refined these early methods to suit specific situations. Likewise have they developed new methods at the Danish National Museum, methods which we are not as yet familiar with, as the reports in many cases have been published in Danish. From the 1st to the 6th of August, 1938, the INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY will hold its second session, in Copenhagen, and on this occasion H. M. King Christian X of Denmark and Iceland will open the new National Museum to the public. The famous stone, bronze, and iron age finds will be shown to the best of their advantage. In conjunction with the meetings of the Congress there will be made excursions to kitchen-middens, Viking graves, to a newly uncovered Viking ship, and to such historical spots as Kronberg Castle at Elsinor (of Hamlet fame), and those who wish can visit the grave of Bothwell, unfortunate husband of Mary Stuart. Of even greater interest will be a special exhibit in the Royal Library where the original of the Flateyarbook, with the text relating to Leif Eriksen's dis- covery, will be placed before you, together with the original manuscripts of the Norse sagas. In this same exhibit will also be the famous Pomo de Ayala manu- script from Peru, probably one of the most important histories written shortly after the Conquest of Peru. The meetings of the Congress are divided into the following sections: A. Physical Anthropology (a) Anatomical and biotypological anthropology. Subject: Mutual rela- tions-Inter-relations and affinities of fossil man; Methodology; The conception of the "race" in anthropology. (b) Physiological and hereditary anthropology. Subject: Geographical propagation of human blood types and their presence in the animal kingdom. 271</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY B. Psychology Subject: Influence of civilization factors on character; general discussion with Sections B and F on the subject of cultural changes. C. Demographye Subject: Population movements seen especially from the view of birth and mortality. D. Ethnology Subject: Origin and development of agriculture and the raising of cattle. Origin of cultivated plants and domestic animals. E. Ethnography (a) Ethnography and folk-lore of Asia. Subject: The nomadic-pastoral peoples of Asia and Africa; together with sections E(a) and E(b). (b) African Ethnography. Subject: See Section E(a). (c) American Ethnography. Subject: The inter-relation between the Central American civilizations and those of North and South America.

Joint discussions of Sections F and B on the subject of cultural changes. G. Linguistics and Writing Subject: Standardization of indigenous languages; formation of common languages-Creole languages and civilized languages spoken by indigenous peoples. Those who should be interested in planning their summer vacation so that they can take advantage of this most important and interesting happening in the world of the sciences of anthropology and ethnography should communicate with their nearest travel agency or the Danish Tourist Bureau, 28 West 48th St., New York City, regarding transportation and cost. For further information regarding the congress, they can write either to Dr. Kaj Birket-Smith, Secretary of the Congress, National Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, or to Frans Blom, in charge of the American Division of the Congress, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana. PACIFIC COAST AREA Cressman, of the University of Oregon, and a working party of ten have just spent six weeks excavating Catlow Cave. Part of the time they had Dr. 272 [3, 1938</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS Smith of the Geology Department with them, and he and the Geology in- structor spent more than a week on reconnaissance of the drainage problem of the Catlow Valley. This work showed there was no outlet, but that it was a typical basin lake bed which drew upon a vast area for its water. The further study by Antevs definitely established the lake as a contemporary of Lake Lahontan. Over two thousand specimens were collected, and these, added to those obtained in 1935, will bring the number of artifacts to well over three thousand. In one section of the cave, where it was dry and relatively free from roof debris, the occupation sequence goes clear back to the water-smoothed rocks in the bottom of the cave. In the more exposed portion of the cave, where the greater amount of excavation was carried out, the occupation goes down to a stratum which is marked by many large roof boulders. This stratum, because of the moisture held by the rocks, is moist; very few artifacts are to be found in it, and these largely in the upper level. Probably the reason for the lack of artifacts even in the upper level is the moisture. A storage pit penetrating into the stratum from the drier level above indicated that the moisture was suffi- cient to destroy perishable material, for basketry in this pit was almost too rotten to be moved. Under this stratum of roof material one comes to beach gravel, and in this were found parts of a human skeleton. The culture material consists of great numbers of pieces of basketry, many sandals, pieces of cane arrow shafts, arrow points, and perhaps some dart points, as well as a possible dart shaft. The basketry appears to be largely made out of tule, although some pieces, in which a twine and probably sagebrush bark is used, have an open-work pattern. This, except for the open-work pat- tern, suggests the soft bags of the plateau region around the Columbia. How- ever, there is probably no connection. The sandals show a change in style from those of the upper level toward the lower. They are for the most part made out of sagebrush bark. The style of basketry is the twined upon a two-ply twisted warp; the type has been found throughout the whole Basin region in southern Oregon and even on the northern stretches of some of the rivers draining into the Columbia. An extremely old culture is indicated, one that can be defined as lacustrine, based upon the great lakes in the Northern Basin region. A cursory examination of the bird and mammal bones indicate a rather marked change in the faunal types of the region, at least in those whose remains were left in the cave. Extended reconnaissance indicates other caves which give promise of even richer materials than that of Catlow. (E.W.G.) SOUTHWESTERN AREA An expedition under the joint sponsorship of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University and the University of Utah spent seven weeks during June and July excavating sites in the vicinities of Marysvale, Ephraim, and Tooele, Utah, under the direction of Dr. John Gillin. Thirty-five rooms or houses were 273</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY excavated at six sites, and a large collection of material culture was obtained, to be shared between the two institutions. The report is now in process of preparation. The field party included, in addition to Dr. Gillin, John M. Longyear, III, representing the Peabody Museum, who acted as surveyor and cartographer; Robert Lister, University of New Mexico; William Mulloy, Uni- versity of Utah, crew foreman; Arden King, Carling Malouf, James Marshall, M. S. Winder, Jr., McKeen Brimhall, Lawrence Angleman, all of the University of Utah; and Raymond Proctor, Salt Lake City, cook. (J. Gillin.) New Mexico Anthropologist The students and faculty of the Department of Anthropology of the Uni- versity of New Mexico wish to announce the new NEW MEXICO ANTHROPOLO- GIST. They have long felt that there is a genuine need for a news sheet of anthropology in general and of the Southwest in particular, as well as for a publication devoted in large part to student work. In the last semester of the 1936-37 school year, therefore, they published a mimeographed sheet intended primarily for departmental consumption. This was received favorably enough so that it was decided to attempt the printing and wider distribution of a magazine of greater scope and more general anthropological interest. This will be issued bi-monthly, and will retail for 35 cents a copy. Subscrip- tions will be $1.25 for one year of five issues. There will be no summer publica- tion, that is, for the months of July-August. Inasmuch as the publication must be self-supporting, if it is to continue to be printed, we ask that the anthropological world as a whole, and students in particular, give us the best of their support. Otherwise it may be necessary that we return to mimeographing. We earnestly solicit news of any anthropo- logical nature from the various departments and research workers, as well as contributions from both students and professional workers. The first issue (September-October) contains a summary of the Departments of Anthropology to be found in the Western United States, a paper on Hopi Ethnology, a calendar of the Season's Pueblo festivals, a paper on Pueblo land grants, a directory of the students of the Department of the University of New Mexico, and a summary of work done at Giusewa and general anthropological news of the summer. All subscriptions should be sent to James Spuhler, business manager of the NEW MEXICO ANTHROPOLOGIST, in care of the Department of Anthropology University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and contributions to Douglas Osborne, managing editor, at the same address. DOUGLAS OSBORNE Managing Editor NEW MEXICO ANTHROPOLOGIST 274 [3, 1938</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS GREAT PLAINS AREA The Nebraska Historical Society's Archaeological Survey spent nearly six months in the field during the season just past. Excavation was made in eight village and five burial sites along the lower Platte River and the Nebraska side of the Missouri River from Omaha to the Kansas line. While the manifestations at most of the sites appear to represent foci of the Nebraska Aspect, other complexes were also encountered. At the mouth of Salt Creek, in the vicinity indicated by Bourgmont in 1718 as being then occupied by the Otos, three different occupations were repre- sented. The materials present in three lodge sites and several exterior cache pits belong to the Nebraska Aspect, while an Oneota affiliation is indicated by the pottery and other artifacts from one house and numerous cache pits. European-contact articles were present in pits with pottery having such traits as were characteristic of the Pawnee. In addition, a few sherds were found six feet beneath the surface in a cut bank, but the conditions of their deposition and their affiliation are not certain. In Nemaha County on the Missouri River, several different manifestations were present, including a complex with shell-tempered, incised pottery. In the banks of a recently cut ravine, cultural material occurred at depths of as much as sixteen feet beneath the surface. Pottery recovered from a stratum in which a fireplace was observed, at a depth of about fourteen feet, has a Woodland- like appearance. In addition to the excavations, a fairly intensive surface survey was made along the two waterways. As a result of the summer's work, additional progress has been made toward the clarification of the archaeological situation along the southeastern front of the state. Study of the materials collected during the season is already begun, and the results will be written up by Paul Cooper for publication in the NEBRASKA HISTORY MAGAZINE. The Survey was privileged to have as visitors during the summer: Dr. J. B. Griffin, of the Ceramic Repository, Ann Arbor; Dr. Thorne Deuel, University of Chicago; Dr. Charles R. Keyes, Iowa State Archaeologist; Dr. Eric Douglas, of the Denver Art Museum; and Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, of the U. S. National Museum. (A. T. Hill.) Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, leading a U. S. National Museum party, spent approximately five weeks on a small but prolific village site about four miles northwest of Kansas City. No trace of houses were found, but thirty-six cache pits were excavated and some three thousand square feet of detritus were examined to a depth of about two feet. The most abundant remains were sherds, of which two distinct types were recovered. One is the Woodland type, identical with the sherds from several deeply buried sites in eastern Nebraska -large conical-bottomed jars with cord-roughened exteriors and rims decorated 275</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY with embossed nodes punched out from the inside of the vessel. Directly asso- ciated and to all appearances contemporaneous with these were rim sherds bear- ing cross-hatched lines and punctate units, below which was a wide plain neck band. The characteristic body decoration of this second type seems to have consisted of non-dentate rocker impressions, occasional roulette imprints, and alternately smooth and roughened zones. There were several clear instances of four-lobed jars. Work in stone included large stemmed points, a rather varied chipped-stone industry, three-quarter grooved axes, and ground celts. Bone work included split metapodial beaming tools, antler projectile points of rather distinct type, perforated animal toe bones, imitation bear canines (perforated), antler cylinders, and long weaving needles. Worked copper was also found in the site as well as in a hilltop burial mound nearby; from the latter prior ex- cavators had taken roulette-decorated pottery, a large fine chipped blade, and scraps of copper. The complex, certainly not characteristic Plains, seems to have a strong Woodland, and perhaps also Hopewellian, flavor. Similar incised and punctate Hopewellian-like rims and rocker-decorated sherds were found at two or three sites near Manhattan, 120 miles west of Kansas City; from a nearby mound earlier diggers had taken a biperforate bear or wolf canine. Still other recorded sites to the number of at least five or six were visited below Kansas City. At Doniphan, where the Kansa village is supposed to have stood in 1724 sixteen protohistoric caches and a dozen burials were excavated. All of the work here was on the hills surrounding the present town; no protohistoric house sites were located. It was noted, however, that as the investigations were carried down hill toward Doniphan, the proportion of contact stuff and of shell- tempered Oneota pottery increased noticeably. It is possible that the main part of the Kansa village stood where Doniphan now is. Two circular earth lodges nearby were opened, evidently belonging to the Nebraska culture despite certain anomalies in form and content. About thirty miles farther up the Missouri, forty-six cache pits and a circular earth lodge in an Oneota village were excavated. This is within twenty- five miles of the Leary Site but, unlike the latter, yielded quantities of copper, iron, and some glass beads. A half dozen rim sherds, all grit tempered and un- questionably assignable to the Lower Loup Focus, were secured. These pieces, while few in number, indicate that the Oneota on Wolf Creek were con- temporaneous with the protohistoric Pawnee on the Loup River in Nebraska. (W.R.W.) A University of Nebraska field party, under the personal direction of Dr. Earl H. Bell, and with WPA assistance, devoted the summer season to work at seven sites: (1) the Verdel Fort site, the remains of an old fortress attributed to the Ponca by G. Owen Dorsey, situated near Verdel, Nebraska; (2) the Ponca Fort Village site, near Site 1; (3) the Davis Mound Group, on bluffs one mile east of Site 1; the Larson site, near Niobrara; (5) the Pishelville site, on 276 [3, 1938</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS the Niobrara River in Knox County; (6) the Redbird Village site, in Holt County; and (7) the Hogan site, an old Ponca burial ground at the juncture of the Niobrara and Missouri rivers. The Ponca fortress at the Verdel site consists of a low wall enclosing an oval area 150X200 yards in dimensions. Excavations disclosed that there had been about the wall an outer trench about five feet deep and eight to ten feet wide. Post molds were found demonstrating the former presence of a stockade of large timbers surrounding the earthen wall. In addition to culture detritus representing the fort occupants, including historic trade materials, there was abundant evidence of an earlier occupation culturally related to the Upper Republican. A cemetery attributed to the later occupants produced the skeletal remains of people with brachycephalic skulls. Another cemetery produced, in addition to skeletal parts, associated trade goods: glass beads, copper, and lead; the bodies had been wrapped in bark and skins and placed in jug-shaped pits. Copper-preserved body tissues were obtained from these graves. Associated pottery was of the Upper Republican variety. Circular house remains were encountered at the Ponca Fort Village site, with hearths situated centrally on house floors. Artifacts of stone, bone, and pottery were found in storage pits. A few historic trade articles were present. An Upper Mississippi-like culture is indicated by the materials. Burials con- tained crania of the brachycephalic type. It seemed evident that this village site was occupied by the fort builders well within the historic period, and the possibility of their being Ponca is of outstanding interest. The mounds of the Davis group produced evidence of burials, and a few potsherds of Woodland-like variety. Although the skeletal material was in a very poor state of preservation, the crania were apparently dolichocephalic. Intrusive and therefore later burials in the mounds produced trade beads and the skeletal remains of people with brachycephalic skulls. A Woodland-like culture was represented by materials obtained at the Larson site. Adjacent mounds were found to contain secondary burials, with dolichocephalic crania, and Woodland-like pottery. At the Pishelville site a circular earth lodge, forty feet in diameter, was excavated. The culture detritus present resembled that found at the Ponca Fort Village site. Similar house remains were encountered at the Redbird site. Moreover, excavation uncovered what is believed to have been a sweat-bath house. The culture represented is similar to that apparent at the Ponca Fort Village and Pishelville sites. Skeletal materials in an excellent state of preservation were taken from graves at the Hogan site. There is no doubt that these are historic Ponca re- mains. The indications are that this region in Nebraska was occupied at an early period by mound builders possessing a Woodland type of culture, followed by people with an Upper Republican type who, to some extent, remained to be 277</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY contemporaneous with the last occupants, the Ponca, into the historic period. (E. H. Bell.) Mr. H. M. Sayre reports interesting results from the excavations conducted during the past summer in Inscription Cave, Montana. Thirteen and one-half feet of stratified deposits, partly wind- and partly water-laid, were found on the floor of the cave. From six to ten feet of slab rock, fallen from the cave roof, rested upon this deposit. This part of the cave appears to have always been dry, and a quantity of perishable material was found below the slab rock. Evidence of human occupation was plentiful and, since trade materials of European cultural origin and any evidence of the horse were lacking, a pre- contact era would seem to be exclusively represented. Materials found include: polished bone implements, together with stone knives and saws employed for cutting the bone; arrow shafts with the rawhide wrapping and bits of feathers intact; pieces of buckskin'showing the sinew sewing; sinew thread; peelings and fragments of cooked Indian turnip; kitchen refuse including the bones of many large and small animals. No pottery was found at the cave. The site was cross sectioned and mapped in great detail, and the material carefully documented and removed to the Montana School of Mines, Uni- versity of Montana. (H. W. Sayre.) NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AREA Under the Minnesota Division of State Parks and the National Park Service, exploration of the archaeological resources of the site of Fort Ridgely, Minnesota, was begun in November, 1936. Work on this site, which was of importance during the Sioux Outbreak of 1862, is concerned chiefly with the remains of the historic period of the niilitary occupation, but one portion of the site has furnished evidence of previous aboriginal occupation, one of the later buildings having been constructed upon a small habitation site. Remains of buildings comprising the post, where possible, are being stabilized as ruins, old lime mortar of the foundations being replaced with concrete. Only one building, the commiissary, of native stone, is to be restored; a portion of the original is still standing, which furnishes a working model, and many historical documents have been consulted in the preparation of plans for the restoration. This rebuilt structure is to be used as a museum and meeting place, where displays illustrative of the prehistory and the history of the area may be placed. Many objects useful for this purpose have been obtained in the course of ex- cavations thus far. Dr. John P. Gillin has joined the faculty of the Ohio State University as Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology, charged with the develop- ment of the courses in anthropology. Courses to be offered next year include Introduction to Anthropology and Archaeology, General Ethnography, Primi- tive Society and Primitive Religion, open to undergraduates, and a seminar on 278 [3, 1938</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND NEWS Cultural Theory for graduate students. It is hoped before long to expand the study of archaeology with the co6peration of the Ohio State Museum. NORTHEASTERN AREA This season Messrs. Douglas S. Byers and Frederick Johnson of Phillips Academy completed their excavation, begun the previous season, of the Nevin shell heap at Blue Hill, Maine. Ground slate and barbed flint points, gouges, plummets, and burials containing hematite are among the additional finds which appear to link this coastal component with the "Red Paint" graves of Maine described by Willoughby and Moorehead. The following comment on his activities is from Dr. Warren K. Moorehead, Director of the Department of American Archaeology of Phillips Academy: "Perhaps the readers of AMERICAN ANTIQUITY, and particularly my many friends, might be interested in a personal statement. I am gradually retiring from active work in American archaeology. As I am no longer young, I believe that past expeditions and studies should be put in shape for publication. With this in mind, and with the assistance of several persons familiar with archaeol- ogy and Indians of the Susquehanna Valley, we have virtually completed our study entitled: The Susquehanna Expedition of 1916. We are at work upon the surveys and manuscripts of Illinois archaeology. When Engineer Taylor, others, and myself ended our labors, Dr. A. R. Kelly took over the Illinois work. The University of Illinois has made a modest grant for the preparation of manu- scripts and conclusions. We hope to issue the report sometime this winter. "Beginning in early youth, I set down, in diary form, a lengthy record of personal experiences and observations. Much of this, being a narrative rather than a technical report, would not interest professional archaeologists. Yet, as I knew personally many of the men who later became famous in American archaeology, it seems proper to prepare and publish the personal record. This would also cover many years in the Indian Service, Department of the Interior. "Several scientists, whom I knew for many years, left us complete, learned, technical reports of their life's work. None of them, however, saw fit to present an interested public with a personal narrative." (W.A.R.) The newly organized Champlain Valley Archaeological Society, at Fort Ticonderoga, New York, headed by Messrs. H. Jermain Slocum and S. H. P. Pell, is conducting its initial field work in northeastern New York and western Vermont. John H. Bailey, in charge of the field parties, reports the discovery of about a dozen graves and pits containing punctate-marked pottery, and refuse deposits yielding sinew stones, projectile points, drills, pendants, gorgets, and potsherds, in the sand layer capping the clay deposit in which Olsen of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, recently found tube- bearing burials near Orwell, Vermont. This is one of the best examples of cul- ture superposition in New York State. Other sites in the region will be explored during the late summer and fall. (W.A.R.) 279</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY On Oneida Lake, central New York, the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences, under the directorship of Arthur C. Parker, is making one of its most important contributions to the archaeology of the New York area. William A. Ritchie, in active charge of the work, and four assistants, during the months of July and August, excavated two large village sites which for the first time established the association of a number of artifact types previously known only as surface strays over a large portion of the state. From deep refuse deposits a wide variety of distinctive notched, barbed, and triangular projectile points, the gouge, plummet, several forms of the bannerstone, native copper imple- ments, choppers, and other traits were recovered. A number of burials also came to light. One of the most perplexing problems of New York archaeology is thus approaching a solution. (W.A.R.) Since March, 1936, the New Jersey State Museum has sponsored a WPA project called "The Indian Site Survey," which has employed an average of sixty persons. The work is being supervised by Dr. Dorothy Cross under the direction of Mrs. Kathryn A. Greywacz, Curator of the Museum. The work is divided into four main departments: Excavation, Research, Site Survey, and Inventory of Collections; with the greatest emphasis, of course, being placed on the excavations. Throughout the past year and one-half, seven main and eleven minor sites in Burlington, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, and Warren Coun- ties have been excavated. During the coming year it is planned to continue operation on some of the sites now under excavation, and to open new "digs" in other parts of the state. Work will continue on the famous Abbott Farm which is situated on the Delaware River bluff one mile south of Trenton, Mercer County. This work will be supplemented by trial "digs" along the bluff above and below the Abbott site, to secure material with which to compare that from the present excavation. In conjunction with the main excavations it is planned to make a series of deep cuts into the bluff in an attempt to settle, if possible, the geological as well as the archaeological possibility of the occurrence of a glacial man. It is planned to continue also the excavations at Red Valley at the base of Sugar Loaf Hill, near Holmeson, Monmouth County, the site where eight perfect bannerstones have been found recently. In addition, work will be started in the spring in the rock shelter region of Sussex County and in the southern part of the state, near Bridgeton, Cumber- land County. The work of the other departments will continue. The located Indian sites are to be plotted on a master map. A companion map will be compiled contain- ing Indian trails and historical places, such as battle grounds, treaty places, and the like. This will be pictorial. The information collected by the Research Department has been arranged 280 [3, 1938</page><page sequence="11">NOTES AND NEWS in a master file at the State Museum. This information will be arranged into small pamphlets on vaiious topics: Food, Shelter, Dress, and so on, which will be illustrated and adapted to school use. (W.A.R.) The annual dinner address of the National Academy of Sciences, held at Rochester, New York, October 26, 1937, was delivered by Dr. Arthur C. Parker, Director of the Rochester Museum, who took as his subject, An Anthropologist Looks Ahead. A survey of the objectives of archaeology was included. (W.A.R.) MIDDLE AMERICA The University Museum, Philadelphia, prosecuted its seventh season at Piedras Negras, Guatemala (Maya "Old Empire"), with Dr. and Mrs. Linton J. Satterthwaite, Jr., Francis M. Cresson, Jr., and Miss Tatiana A. Proskouria- koff as staff, and Don Victor M. Pinelo as Guatemalan government Inspector. Six "palaces" were worked for information on the function of these long buildings. Six new thrones were encountered, each with the ornamental back- screen which is considered a safe throne diagnostic, together with two benches similar to many throne seats, one without the screen, the other possibly without it. A throne is a stone or masonry table or bench on which a Maya notable sat in state. This is deduced from relief representations in the Usumacinta, Puuc and central Peten regions. To date, out of seventeen known palaces, eight contained eleven thrones and two benches which may have been such. This number may increase with more complete excavation of four of these eight. Four palaces did not contain furnishings of imperishable material; five others have not been investigated for them. Among the palaces there is still no sign of the burned stone "column altar" which occurred, or probably occurred, in fourteen of the sixteen supposed temples. In only one temple is there a bench of the throne type, and that temple plan is atypical. It seems clear that in the temples the priest usually functioned as the servant of the gods, burning incense around the altar, the center of interest. In some of the rooms of many of the palaces the thrones made the priest him- self the center of interest, perhaps as civil or religious administrator. This is true also of the outer rooms of one, probably two, and possibly more of the eight known sweat-houses. Only two of the thrones are so placed that more than a few persons could gather in a court or plaza in front of the rooms containing them, as is the case with the temple altars; nor are thrones usually centered behind a doorway. Many of them could have functioned in no larger a gathering than that de- picted on Lintel 3, now in the University Museum. Since many of these thrones are secondary constructions, and thrones are absent in at least one-quarter of known palaces, additional uses for these buildings seem assured. There is no sign that this was ordinary habitation. A minor problem in palace design was attacked and perhaps solved. The 281</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY transversely placed end-rooms, so common in double or multiple-range palaces in Peten and Yucatan, are typical at Piedras Negras but rare or absent at Yaxchilan and Palenque, the two other important Usumacinta district sites. Three bits of evidence point to their introduction here under Peten influence in a middle period. These are the discovery of a double-range palace without the end-rooms, the late addition of the end-room to the predecessor of another, and the remodeling of a third to supply them where originally absent. Appar- ently this was an innovation rejected at the other sites. Excavations on nine temple substructures showed marked correspondences with central Peten design; this influence, established a year ago, was evidently strong for a considerable time. A stratification of inset rectangular over inset round corners was found. Two pyramids had a type of relief decoration new to the site and possibly to Maya architecture generally. The elaborate deity masks of Pyramid K-5 were shown to belong to the latest of three superimposed pyramids. A seemingly new type of geometric relief terrace decoration was found on the Acropolis. Apparently fairly early, this was incorporated in the base of a later pyramid showing Peten characteristics. Work in the group containing all the earliest dated stelae confirms the belief that this group originally consisted of buildings on low substructures, preceding the later pyramids and probably preceding the carved and the few well-made plain stelae on the surface. Finding an extremely small, crudely formed plain stela, broken and used in early masonry, suggests that the stela idea reached the site before it was ready for stone carving or the erection of moderately heavy monuments. An important series of late pottery shapes comes from one palace, where pots were left in profusion on floors and thrones. This collection was begun a year ago, but is now greatly augmented. Most were undoubtedly polychrome painted, but being in a non-vaulted palace with little protecting debris, humic acid has destroyed most of the decoration. Sherds in moderate numbers were collected from various superimposed building levels. Anticipating a proper study of sherds now available, it seems safe to say that two pottery periods will be distinguishable on the basis of bowl shapes and decorations. The moderate- sized, rounded-bottom, flanged tripod occurs in the earliest known deposits. Since similar flanged forms are typical of the third of four main ceramic periods at Uaxactun, in the Peten, a later beginning of occupation at Piedras Negras is implied. This does not impeach the architectural evidence that this was before the earliest carved Piedras Negras dates. For the first time figure carving is represented by satisfactory portions of several bowls, all surface specimens of flattened hemispherical form. Plumbate ware continues to be absent from the collections. In view, however, of the extreme rarity of carved ware-a dozen or so of finds in seven seasons-it may have been missed. (Report supplied by Linton Satterthwaite, Jr., Director of the Expedition; J.A.M.) Dr. A. V. Kidder has kindly prepared the following notes regarding the [3, 1938 282</page><page sequence="13">NOTES AND NEWS archaeological researches of the Carnegie Institution of Washington during the past season in Middle America. Copan: Gustav Stromsvik in charge, Aubrey S. Trik, Assistant. Mr. Stromsvik devoted the major part of the season to the assembling and studying, with the help of Dr. Morley who spent some six weeks at Copan, of the scattered stones of the great Hieroglyphic Stairway. The section of the Stairway still in place was consolidated and such higher steps as could confidently be re- assembled either on the basis of the old Peabody Museum photographs or on internal evidence, were replaced. Mr. Stromsvik also conducted excavations in a Ball Court adjoining the Hieroglyphic Stairway, finding three levels of reconstruction and recovering some beautifully sculptured markers. Mr. Trik continued study and repair of Temple XXII, the elaborately sculptured edifice which was originally excavated by Maudslay, but which was badly damaged by the earthquake of 1934. In the course of this work, Mr. Trik recovered from the fallen material below Temple XXII a number of very fine stone heads which originally formed part of the decoration of the facade. Mr. Stromsvik completed the diversion canal and constructed a dam which it is hoped will prevent the Copan River from further encroaching on the ruins. Uaxactun: A. Ledyard Smith in charge, E. M. Shook, Assistant. In this the, for the time at least, final season of excavation at Uaxactun, Mr. Smith com- pleted excavation of the great multi-chambered structure known as the Palace, recovering further data on the stratigraphy both of pottery types and archi- tectural practices. He also conducted minor excavations in a number of other buildings, the most interesting finds having been made in Temple A-XVIII, where there was unearthed a tripod vase containing an anthropomorphic jade figure some eleven inches high; and in Temple B-XIII, one of whose rooms contained a beautifully preserved fresco ten feet long depicting a ceremonial procession. Guatemala: A. V. Kidder in charge; Jesse D. Jennings, Assistant. Excava- tions were continued at the Mound at Kaminal-juyu, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, which was partly cleared in 1936. The tumulus was found to consist of eight superimposed structures, the five outermost of pyramidal form. In a line running from below the center of the earliest structure eastward to beyond the limits of the mound were six tombs, each of which contained a principal skeleton and the remains of several apparently sacrificed victims. Large amounts of mortuary offerings were recovered. Two similar tombs lying to the west of a nearby mound were also cleared. During the winter, Dr. H. E. D. Pollock conducted a reconnaissance in the Guatemalan Highlands and on the Pacific Coast, later in the season joining Messrs. A. L. Smith and Shook for a canoe journey down the Usumacinta, visiting Altar de Sacrificios, Yaxchilan, and Piedras Negras, where the party visited the University of Pennsylvania expedition under Linton Satterthwaite. Chichen Itza: No excavations were carried on. Dr. Morley, on returning 283</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY from Copan, devoted the balance of the winter and the spring to final revision of his compendious monograph on the inscriptions of Peten. Mr. Ruppert made studies of the so-called "Toltec" architecture at Chichen. Miscellaneous: Dr. Alexander Pogo is attacking the problem of the correla- tion of Maya and Christian chronology from the astronomical viewpoint. J. E. Thompson finished his report on the archaeology of San Jose, British Honduras, and later visited museums in England and Italy. Under the super- vision of F. B. Richardson, the Carnegie Institution is making as complete a file as possible of photographs of Maya sculpture, and is anxious to secure copies of all unpublished photographs of sculptures. Miss Anna Shepard was in Guatemala for two months making technological studies of the pottery from Uaxactun. This large collection is being written up for publication by R. E. Smith. Historical Research: Mr. France Scholes spent the year in Cambridge work- ing on materials collected by him in past years in the Archives of the Indies at Seville. He was assisted by Miss Eleanor B. Adams and Dr. Robert Chamber- lain. The latter went to Guatemala, Honduras, and Chiapas for archive study in the late winter. The archives of Guatemala are proving unexpectedly rich in materials bearing on the Colonial period. Non-archaeological researches conducted by the Carnegie Institution in- cluded ethnological and sociological studies by Drs. Robert Redfield and Sol Tax in the Guatemalan Highlands, linguistic researches by Dr. Manuel Andrade in the highlands, agronomic studies by J. E. Kempton and Raymond Stadelman, anthropometric and statistic studies in Yucatan by Dr. Steggerda, and studies on the distribution of Maya groups in the sixteenth century by Ralph Roys. (J.A.M.)
