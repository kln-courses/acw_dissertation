<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME EVIDENCE OF RELIGIOUS CONTINUITY IN THE GREEK DARK AGE by B. C. Dietrich This century has fortunately abandoned the idea of the Greeks as a unique people who suddenly appeared on earth, as if from another world, and magically at one stroke produced their singular culture. Nor was Greek religion born in a vacuum but represented the end result of a lengthy development in which the entire Aegean area had a share. What complicates this subject is the almost total absence of written records which might have decisively settled some apparently insoluble problems and controlled the frequently ambi- guous archaeological material. This lack of continuous and conclusive evidence carries with it two considerable dangers of which the first and most obvious consists in the admittedly glorious opportunity for unbridled conjecture. More insidious, however, are the risks involved in concluding from the absence of material remains that a particular period of Greek or pre-Greek history simply did not come to pass at certain sites. The inference therefore that in these instances one should postulate a cultural break, seems sensible and persuasive; but this method too has its faults. In Colophon, for instance, in the east Aegean, no Submycenaean level has been found, 1 but this does not mean that Apollo's Klaros oracle temporarily fell silent at the end of the second millennium and regained its voice only later.2 The same holds true for Artemis' cult at Ephesus, and for the oracle at Didyma near Miletus.3 The moral to be drawn from this type of instance seems to be that one should not unconditionally trust the archaeologist who pro- nounces on religious continuity from the presence or absence of ceramic remains alone. Therefore it is best to steer a course somewhere between the Scylla of rash hypothesis and the Charybdis of negative disbelief. This particularly applies to what is probably the most difficult period of Greek history, namely the so-called Dark Agę from about 1100 until 650 B.C. There can be no historical certainty for these five hundred years, which, however, remain a dark period through lack of records and not necessarily because they truly constituted a politically or culturally fallow era. In this state of doubt and conjecture the religious historian enjoys a few distinct advantages. He has some knowledge of Minoan and Mycenaean cults. He can trace the development of pre- Greek religion on the mainland from the beginning of Middle Helladic, that is from the probable 16</page><page sequence="2">time of arrival of the Indo-European Achaeans. He knows that religious beliefs represent the most conservative elements of society, and he can read on the Linear B tablets a number of divine names which, together with lists of offerings, were common currency in the Archaic and Classical sacral calendar. In other words, major gods like Zeus, Hera, Dionysus, Hermes, Demeter, Athena, and perhaps even Apollo, who throughout Greek history were recipients of cult, had even before the end of the Bronze Age become isolated with their various functions from a less clearly defined common Aegean religious background. It seems that the general concept of divinity, too, like that of the collective Olympians, was already known in Late Helladic, for the Linear tablets were familiar with the words theos and parités theoi. However stormy the political events may have been which marked the Dark Age, what little evidence there is does suggest that in essence Greek religion was a continuation of Bronze Age traditions. This period, in other words, most likely did not witness an interruption in the sense of a complete cultural break, although the Greek world experienced a time of need and suffering, a strong recession, which remained so firmly fixed in memory that centuries later Herodotus could still speak of poverty as the Greeks' constant companion.4 It is generally argued that the change from the flourishing culture of the Bronze Age to the decay and misery of the last millennium B.C. was brought about by a Dorian invasion. These barbaric tribes are said to have appeared suddenly in the south and, like a tidal wave, destroyed the palaces, put an end to the old theocratic city administration, and brought new masters who introduced their own system of government and celebrated cults which were alien to the tradi- tional Minoan-Mycenaean festivals. It was a clean break, then, and obvious to all by virtue of the roughly contemporary arrival of new modes of burial and forms of art. Unfortunately the history of events at the time must have been somewhat more complex if it is to explain the actual survival of so many religious and cultic traditions. There are three important types of evidence concerning the unrest which affected Greece at the end of the Bronze Age: the heroic tradition, linguistic studies, and the archaeological material. The turning point in Mycenaean affairs is said to have been the Trojan War which, according to the most reliable tradition and with the help of contemporary Hittite evidence, has been placed at c. 1250 B.C.5 Modern opinion is divided about the effect of this campaign: either it exhausted the Mycenaean world to such an extent that foreign invaders found it easy to overcome resistance on the Greek mainland, or the prolonged struggle caused revolution at home, at a time when the governing aristocracy was wasting its strength before the walls of Troy. However, heroic tradition agrees that invasions of Greece occurred after the Trojan War.6 Leaving aside for the moment the description of less important incursions, one reads in the traditional accounts of the eventual success in the Peloponnese of the three Dorian kings who conquered Teisamenos, son of Orestes and Hermione, and divided his realm into three parts of which Temenos and son received the Argolid, Kresphontes Messenia, and Aristodemos' sons Laconia. Thereafter Teisamenos drove the Ionians from Achaea, and these first migrated to Athens and subsequently to Ionia. The invaders are also said to have occupied the Megarid, but ultimately to have moved across the Aegean to Melos, Thera, Crete, the Dodecanese islands, and Asia Minor. In Attica, according to the story of Codrus, the Dorians had no success. Other migratory movements, reacting to the Dorians, are said to have occurred in the north of Greece, like Thessaly, but also in Aetolia and Boeotia. There is no need to dwell on the more obvious flaws of the traditional accounts, such as the addition of late elements, the admixture of myth to true historic memory, and the interpo- lation of legendary personages in the generations list whose chronology, therefore, is liable to be in conflict with the results of archaeological work. 7 It is rather more vital to establish two points from all of these stories immediately: first, the Dorians as a separate racial entity 17</page><page sequence="3">remain curiously elusive, and secondly their connexion with Heracles' family seems to go back some four generations before the irruption into the Peloponnese. 8 Herodotus' account in 1,56 implies that the name of these nomadic people was changeable according to their location at a given time.9 Immutable only were the names of the three traditional Doric tribes, the Hylleis, Pamphyli, and Dymanes,10 which successfully attacked the Peloponnese three generations after Hyllus' death. But the eponyms of these tribes were Heraclids, that is, of course, genuine Achaeans who traced their descent to Perseus, king of Mycenae. 11 It would be interesting to pursue further the close connexion between these 'foreign' Dorians and the Mycenaean Hera- clids, their common haunts in S.Epirus, Crete, and Rhodes, 12 but at the moment it must suffice to establish their proximity to the Mycenaean world. Recent linguistic investigations have revealed13 that Greek dialects, like Ionic, Attic and Aeolic, developed only after the arrival of West Greek. To the last dialect, of course, apart from the language of Locris, Phocis, Aetolia and Elis, belonged Doric which was spoken in Laconia, the Argolid, Corinthia, the Megarid, in the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, and in parts of the southern coast of Asia Minor. Therefore the spread of the West Greek language can be said to indicate the geographical distribution of the Dorian tribes. It seems equally valid to trace the migrations of Ionic, Aeolic and Attic peoples by means of the post-Bronze Age distribution of the East Greek language. The knowledge gained from such linguistic studies also agrees with what had already been learnt from the perhaps unevenly spread, but nevertheless valuable, evidence of the Linear B tablets. The language on these was in use on the mainland at least until 1200 B.C. and seemed to approach a kind of koine which, however, already showed the beginnings of a dialectal division destined to be completed after the arrival of West Greek. Linear B, for example, not only contains traces of Proto-Ionic and Proto-Aeolic, but provides evidence that the language of the Peloponnese, and southern Greece, was an ancestor of Arcadian. It seems possible therefore to prove linguis- tically that some mainland areas, like Arcadia, where the early language survived the longest, were spared from the unrests of the early Iron Age.14 However, linguistic studies tell even less than the traditional stories the magnitude of the incursions, the time involved in migration to and from Greece, and especially the impact of these events on established culture and religion. Finally, the archaeological finds on the mainland also give a clear impression of widespread upheavals. The palace at Iolkos in Thessaly was destroyed early in II IC, without proof, how- ever, of foreign occupation. 13 In Phocis the fortress at Krisa succumbed late in IIIB.1^ Gla in Boeotia was destroyed at about the same time,17 while Eutresis was abandoned in IIIB.18 Other destroyed sites, outside the Argolid, include the Messenian Pylos, Zygouries in Corinthia, and the Menelaion in Laconia. To these should be added those settlements that were abandoned during the same period, namely some places south of Thessaly in the Argolid, Laconia, Elis, Messenia, and a few in western Attica. Affairs on the mainland at the end of the second millennium were not exactly peaceful, but none of these obvious disturbances necessarily implies a clear break in the history of Greek religion, caused by the sudden irruption of foreign invaders like the Dorians. If new elements arrived on the scene, their appearance more likely took the form of a gradual infiltration. This seems a more reasonable way to explain the painfully wide temporal gap between the destruction of a settlement and its reoccupation. In the southern Peloponnese, and in the Argolid, this gap could occasionally extend over as much as two hundred years. At times, too, the destruction of a city was a protracted business: in Mycenae, for example, the end came in three successive waves which embraced the period from L.H. IIIB-C.19 Again some sites, like the Messenian Pylos, were abandoned after destruction, others, such as Tiryns, Amyclae and Iolkos, continued 18</page><page sequence="4">to be settled generally by the former Mycenaean inhabitants. How is it possible, in fact, that the Dorians did not themselves immediately occupy their newly won conquests? Thucydides says of the Dorians that they remained in the Peloponnese from the time of their arrival. He must have been wrong, however,20 because, according to the most recent archaeological inter- pretations, it seems that the Argolid was not completely resettled before 1075, while the S.W. Peloponnese apparently remained deserted until as late as the turn of the millennium. The effect of this type of archaeological evidence on the traditional genealogy of the Spartan kings is too drastic to contemplate. But there is more at stake than the hope of tearing down elaborate genealogical structures built up through family pride. Foreign elements should signal their arrival on the mainland by an evident break in cultural tradition. In fact, seemingly novel art styles and forms make their appearance during Submycenaean, that is the circa one hundred years from 1125 to 1035 B.C. which divide Mycenaean and Protogeometri c. As far as vase decoration is concerned, however, Submycenaean marks a period of decline, or degeneration, of preceding motifs rather than the introduction of new styles. In other words, Submycenaean continued old forms which directly evolved into Protogeometri c and Geometric without any outside intervention. The discovery of Submycenaean ware in graves in the Athenian Kerameikos and in Salamis21 led to the belief that this style developed in Attica. Importance was also attached to the fact that objects of this period were generally found in cist graves with single burials, a practice which contrasted with the common Mycenaean multiple burial in chamber tombs. Desborough accordingly concluded from this evidence that Attica too had been the scene of a Dorian invasion which is not reflected in the traditional records, because it preceded their irruption into the Argolid and Peloponnese. However, examples of cist, beside shaft and pit, graves from various mainland sites seem to show that this form of burial was in use as early as Middle Helladic.22 The archaeological material is fully discussed by Styrenius,23 and Desborough himself concedes that cist graves occurred in e.g. Eleusis from M.H.-L.H. 1 1 1 B/C. Admittedly no single mainland site so far shows continuity of cist graves from M.H. until Submycenaean; this may be due to the accident of discovery or, of course, to a temporary interruption, but tells nothing about foreign invaders. Single, as opposed to multiple, burial could also be explained as arising out of Mycenaean practice, for the larger tholos often contained separate cist-type graves which could occur in chamber tombs as well as a kind of individual burial in a, so to speak, multiple burial ground.24 In any case, single burial has already been attested in Mycenaean for Argos, Athens, and Perati.2^ The introduction of cremation usually provides the strongest argument for a cultural break and the arrival of foreign elements in Greece. Notable, though, in this connexion is the fact that cremation (for adults) during Protogeometric was almost universal in Athens, and possibly the rest of Attica, in Lefkandi, and Medeon in Phocis, as well as in parts of central Greece. But other sites continued to practise inhumation even in Submycenaean and Protogeometric. No one can say why Attica especially should have been the odd man out; perhaps Webster is right26 to suggest overcrowding bv refugees from the west as the cause, but again there is nothing in this temporary practice to prove foreign custom, particularly since cremation already occurred sporadically in Mycenaean times, e.g. in Pylos, Leucas, Argos, Rhodes and Attica, as well as in Knossos and Troy VI.27 It matters little in this connexion whether cremation had ultimately been brought to Greece from Cyprus or Syria, 28 or whether the custom came from Asia Minor.29 Similarly inconclusive evidence of northern invaders seem to be the finds of jewellery and other artefacts from Submycenaean graves. In Attica, for instance, while the multitude of Cypriote gold ornaments in Perati tombs came from Mycenaean settlers in Cyprus, new jewellery forms at 19</page><page sequence="5">that time in the Kerameikos could have been connected with northern elements like the Lausitz Culture. But beside these new fashions there usually continued older Mycenaean traditions, albeit in debased form. 30 Again, the use of iron, as opposed to bronze, in the manufacture of ornaments could not have been introduced to Greece by the Dorians;31 nor can the origin of the Submycenaean long dress-pins and arched fibulae be determined. It is quite possible that they were made by the Mycenaeans at home.32 It seems that much of the archaeological evidence turns out to be a mirage. If new people did arrive on the scene, their customs were no different from those of the natives. Granted, whole worlds lie between the bureaucratic administration of the Mycenaean palaces and the system of government in the classical polis. Who is to say, however, that such changes were not the result of an organic development which, like the evolving art styles, received its impetus from within? What seems even more remote is the assumption that the events of the Dark Age fundamentally disturbed the continuity of religious traditions. However, there is also a positive side to the archaeological evidence of this period. To begin with, the impression of an entirely deserted Peloponnese after 1200 B.C. seems exagger- ated. Indeed, a map showing those settlements which did not succumb to the catastrophes but continued, presumably with their cults, would cover much of the old Mycenaean world.33 In addition to the numerous examples of enduring settlement, actual cult continuity can pretty well be proved for Mycenaean sanctuaries by means of remains from offerings, sacrificial fires, altars etc. Such cult localities include the site of Helen's temple in Therapnae,34 that of Athena Alea' s temple in Tegea, and Athena Kranaia's in Elateia.35 In Thermos Apollo's Archaic temple was built directly over a Mycenaean sanctuary.36 The Aetolian Thermos was settled from at least L.H.II, and although remains from II I C are only few, many Geometric finds have been made, and there is no evidence of interruption at the end of the Bronze Age.37 Apollo Maleatas' cult in Epidaurus was celebrated at a locality which was sacred from Early Helladic.3® Amyclae, too, where Apollo Hyacinthus was revered in historical times, was an ancient cult site which concealed many Mycenaean, Protogeometric, and Geometric remains of offerings.39 This area was perhaps exclusively devoted to cult, because it is not associated with any Mycenaean buildings. This same point may account for the sparse Mycenaean remains in one of the three most important Greek cult sites, namely Olympia. Very little was found in the Altis, but recently some evidence of M.H. structures came to light on the Kronion.40 In Delphi an L.H.III settlement existed between Castalia and Apollo's temple which most likely had been built above a Bronze Age sanctuary, since numerous Mycenaean offerings were discovered on the spot. It is possible that some time during the Mycenaean period the sanctuary was removed to nearby Marmaria, to judge from the find of many Mycenaean idols beneath Athena Pronai a' s temple. Eleusis perhaps is the most brilliantly illustrated example of cult continuity on the main- land. This is a difficult and much debated site, but with a little patience it is possible to trace the development from the Megaron B to Peisistratus' Telesterion. On the Aegean islands cult continuity may be assumed for Aegina, Keos, and Delos. In each case a sanctuary or temple was erected at the exact site which previously had been sancti- fied by cult. This applies to Artemis Aphaea's temple on Aegina, 41 Artemis' Archaic temple on Delos,42 and the Bronze Age temple at Hagia Eirene on Keos.43 20</page><page sequence="6">The case for Samos is rather more problematical,44 because there is no conclusive evidence forSubmycenaean. A useful indication of religious continuity on Samos, however, is furnished by the persistence of the typical Bronze Age votive terracottas of the bull found in the open air sanctuaries, and the earliest of the great temples,45 and dedicated in honour of the same goddess whose classical name of Hera may have come to Samos with the Ionian immigrants from the Argolid.46 It seems to follow from what has been said already that continuity of settlement implies continuity of cult, particularly where a classical temple was built above a Bronze Age sanctuary, as e.g. at Athens, Mycenae, Tiryns etc. I should further like to suggest, albeit with some caution, that the cult form, too, fundamentally remained the same in the period following the end of Mycenaean, at least at those sites which clearly did not suffer interruption of settlement and worship. There is no written source to support this claim, but proof lies precisely in the fact that both the cult community and cult place did not alter. Neither should one expect the gods, who were bound to these localities, and whose names are mostly recorded on the Linear tablets, to have cast off their original nature and functions and become unrecognizable to the worshipper. This seems a reasonable assumption which can in fact be illustrated from a valuable recent study of Greek terracottas in the Dark Age.47 Appa- rently the typical Mycenaean 4 Psi' shaped figurine disappeared from mainland graves at the end of the twelfth century,48 suggesting to some that the cult associated with this goddess was interrupted during the eleventh and tenth centuries.49 That this was not so should become plain once the evidence from a wider area, within the Mycenaean ambit, is taken into account, especially from East Greece and Crete. In some cases, like that of Crete, local artistic tradition created individual styles, or types, but these only very thinly disguised the common underlying religious beliefs which continued from the end of the Bronze Age. In Crete, in fact, the Minoan-Mycenaean tradition of the goddess, as she was represented by the typical 12th/ 1 1th century idols from Gazi, Prinias, and Karphi, continued not only in the Protogeometric (10th/9th) period, as witness the wheel-made Kalokhorio head,50 and some statues from Phaestos,51 but throughout the Dark Age. This continuity applied to both the hand-made and the larger wheel-made images and can best be seen from the fragments of the three Vrokastro statuettes which span the time from Subminoan to the eighth century. 52 Associated with this goddess in Bronze Age cult was the figure of the bull, also represented by numerous terracotta votives which, with the possible exception of the Eteocretan region, also continued on the island throughout the Dark Age, e.g. at Kavousi,53 Vrokastro,54 Lato, 55 and at Gortyn.56 Most interesting for the history of cultic interdependence between Crete and the mainland is that the type of 13th/ 12th century wheel-made terracotta bull, usually found in association with open air sanctuaries, seems to have been introduced to Crete from Greece, but the actual tradition of bull votives was probably begun in Crete as early as the beginning of the second millennium and ultimately derived from common Aegean religious practice.57 Now the persistence of votive dedications of the goddess and her bull vouch for continuity of cult not only in Crete but in other areas like Cyprus,58 and it is this figure of the bull in particular that provides the connecting link between the end of the Mycenaean and Archaic Age in Greece where finds have been much less impressive. The number of votives at the moment is not especially great, and they seem to be confined in the main to Attica and East Greece, where they had been introduced, presumably by Mycenaean emigrants, to places like Samos and Emporio in Cos; but their survival through the Dark Age argues for continuity of cult whatever the archaeological evidence concerning individual settlements in these areas.59 If, outside Attica, other parts of the mainland do not show a continuous sequence of such votives, this 21</page><page sequence="7">may be due to accident and should not necessarily be read as negative evidence against per- sistence of cult, for by the end of the Dark Age the habit of fashioning these terracottas in the old technique was reacquired throughout Greece, as examples of which one may cite e.g. the two eighth century Amyclae heads,60 and the masks from Tiryns.61 Two important points emerge from a consideration of these Greek votives: firstly the strongest evidence of their survival comes from the Dorian areas in Crete and on the mainland, precisely where a change might have damaged our cause,62 and secondly the seventh century idols of the goddess in the traditional pose of raised arms had not only reappeared in Cyprus,63 Crete,64 Samos, 6^ Rhodes,66 Boeotia,67 and Lemnos,68 but in Athens, at least for a time, had become "almost as common as they had ever been in the Bronze Age".69 Obviously it is not always easy to decide whether a particular figurine portrayed a votary or a god. But in many instances we must be dealing with representations of divinities, espe- cially in the case of the goddess with raised arms. It also seems extremely probable that these votives were not unlike the contemporary cult figures, some of which - the so-called xoana - though fashioned from perishable wood, may have survived even down to Pausanias' day.70 There is one particularly striking illustration of this remarkable religious conservatism which emerges from a history of the Greek votive terracottas: in the Bronze Age sanctuary at Hagia Eirene in Keos, where cult endured through the Dark Age, the head from a sixteenth century statue was fixed on a makeshift base and still served as a cult image in the eighth century.71 If it seems justifiable to reject the theory of new cultural elements in Greece at the end of Helladic, then for the most part one is left with divinities who retained name and function until classical times. This is not to deny them the benefits of natural development over the centuries: individual divine spheres, like those e.g. of Apollo and Poseidon, extended and became moralized, but in this history there can be no question of fundamental change through outside influence. Not even the process of synoecism in the Archaic Age interrupted this essential continuity; each member of the Olympian family always kept his roots deep in the past. Time does not permit a discussion of the probable political history of the Dark and Archaic Age, but there is not much interest in these events for the religious historian. Admittedly the Mycenaean wanax disappeared from the mortal stage, and the basileus quite probably lost his political power fairly early. However, the administration of polis cults, even in the period of democracy, always remained in the hands of the aristocratic families from whose ranks after all the basileus, and probably the wanax, had been chosen. In the course of the Geometric period, during the eighth century, or slightly earlier, there appeared what seemed to be some architectural and artistic innovations. But none of these turns out to be very convincing evidence of cultural change either. It is strange, of course, that figures and anthropomorphic representations disappeared from vase decoration during the Dark Age until the ninth and eighth centuries. This curious Geometric fashion, and it is no more than that, has nothing to say about culture and religion. It has been tried, but without much success, to draw conclusions from such abstract designs regarding contemporary society. Even the Homeric hexameter has been compared with this regular style of decoration. The results of such lucubrations naturally are edifying but of no merit to any historical evaluation. Little more is to be learnt from the grand manner of Archaic temple building. Firstly the erection of separate cult structures was not a new fashion at the time, as witness the examples at Hagia Triada,72 Eleusis,73 Delos,74 and Keos,7^ and secondly the Doric order of the megaron- type temple continued and developed older forms on the mainland.76 It is possible and likely that the Greek temple evolved from the megaron building which was occasionally associated 22</page><page sequence="8">with early open air sanctuaries and designed to hold the cult image, like the twelfth century structure at Hagia Triada in Crete.77 In any case the site of the Heraion in Samos and the series of buildings in Aetolian Thermos afford the opportunity of watching the progress of this development in the Archaic Age.78 It is unreasonable to expect the impoverished Dark Age settlements to produce such imposing stone buildings. Economically this kind of effort was unthinkable before the eighth century, that is roughly the time when the Greek mainland was gradually recovering from the turmoil of the end of the Bronze Age. It seems plain, however, that the god inhabiting this grand temple was not a new one, nor, incidentally, was it a novel fashion, which came into vogue from late Archaic times, to honour this god by the dedication of large and life-size cult images. Examples that come to mind of a similar Bronze Age practice are the sixteenth century statues from Hagia Eirene, and the hand from a life-size statue in the Heraklion Museum.79 Recently Lord William Taylour uncovered a number of two-feet-high idols from a thirteenth century shrine at Mycenae.80 So far, then, one may hold on to two important facts: a) the continuity of certain cult sites and traditions, and b) the continuity of divine nomenclature. The question arises, how Mycenaean religious beliefs could have weathered the undeniable political storms of the period under dis- cussion. The Mycenaean world distinguished itself through its generally shared customs, practices and language. Such features, together with the excellent Mycenaean road system, give some indication of the outstanding state of communications at the time. This was lost in Greece at about the turn of the millennium; only the individual communities, or settlement units, sur- vived, and they were confined to their particular local areas. That means that temporarily contact may have been broken between neighbours, but each community, because it already existed in Mycenaean times, separately preserved its gods and cult until synoecism brought them together in the polis. But these communities met once more, well before this date, in order to join in the cele- bration of their common inherited cults. Signs of this process are the religious amphictyonies that sprang up as early as the tenth and ninth centuries in larger districts like Attica-Boeotia and Corinthia-Argolid. The difference between the Dark Age and polis communities lay in the tribal and clan asso- ciation which bound together the former, while the ties of a classical city depended either on geographical conditions or were forged by the argument of political convenience. Leaving aside as unprovable the question whether this clan association involved actual blood relationship, and quietly omitting the often preposterous arguments about Bronze Age matrilineal societies in Greece, one might consider the possibility that the Dark Age communities directly descended from similarly organized Mycenaean groups. In the Mycenaean city, exactly as in e.g. classical Athens, state and religion were one and the same. Unlike any Christian state, the Greek city practised a kind of Gesellschafts- religion , which means that both Mycenaean settlement and Greek polis were composed of units like tribes, demes, phratries etc., and that these units were associated with particular deities - e.g. Poseidon or Zeus - who received cult and in turn protected their communities, and, of course, survived together with the tribes and demes. Already in Mycenaean times god and tribe were such inseparable concepts that Nestor's Pylos, for example, would have been unthink- able as a unit without Poseidon: this much one may still gather from Homer's reference to the nine Pylian groups (hedrai) which were connected through the worship of Poseidon.81 The discovery of the tribal system as the instrument which transmitted religious tradition from the Bronze Age to classical times entails the acceptance of two consequential points. 23</page><page sequence="9">Firstly it becomes necessary to contradict the generally-held opinion that this system came into being in Archaic times, or not much earlier, and secondly the Mycenaean records should at least hint at the existence of some kind of tribal or group organization whether it was called genos , oikos , demos , or what you will. The nature of such organizations in the Dark Age is obscure. Inscriptional and literary evidence, especially from the orators, becomes plentiful only after the fifth century. Also Cleisthenes' reforms are not particularly revealing, because his division of Attica into ten tribes and thirty trittyes was politically motivated. This organization, according to Aristotle,82 was preceded by another system dividing Attica into four tribes with twelve phratries and thirty gene each, and therefore based on the annual calendar rather like the arrangement in a later Greek city in Egypt. 83 This kind of evidence merely reveals that tribal and demos division was an ancient institution and so firmly fixed by the sixth century that it lent itself to poli- tical exploitation. The most important units were the phyle , phratry and genos , which in historical times were so fully integrated that genos was subordinate to phratry, and phratry to phyle . It is a matter of dispute whether this system obtained from the beginning, but more interesting is the probable age of the various groups whose structure, it should be remembered, might have altered in the course of the centuries, particularly as the result of political action. The history of the phyle is wrapped in darkness, but in literature this term is usually con- nected with the Dorians. The three Dorian tribes had no obvious kinship relationship but operated as military units, and Tyrtaeus still speaks of the tribal arrangement of the Spartan army. 84 The typically Doric phyle- system is remembered in the Homeric Catalogue,85 but the actual word phyle does not occur in Homer, while the usage of his phylon is rather different.86 Phratry was apparently an old Indo-European term, which should indicate the antiquity of the community title. Only Ionic, however, used phrater for 'brother', while, apart from Cos and Argos, the Dorians seem to have been unacquainted with the phratry as a unit. Their name for a similar group was hetaireia . The phratry, too, does not seem to have been held together by ties of blood relationship, although subsequently invented common ancestors, together with the suffix -idae, resulted in individual phratry names like Achniadae, Clytidae, Alcmaeonidae etc. By the sixth century phratries had degenerated into purely territorial units useful only for administrative purposes. Phratry, like phyle , each individually possessed roughly the same rights concerning land tenure, property ownership, and the administration of cult. This point, incidentally, does seem to suggest that each group originally had been a separate entity, and that the Archaic Age was responsible for obliterating the boundaries between phratry and genos , and genos and other groups.87 There is no evidence, of course, to prove the existence of Dark Age phratries, but it is useful to remember that Homer knew of military units called phratries88 which also possessed certain family rights like exclusion. Now, it was precisely this type of community under discussion which continued traditional religious material into historical times. The administration of a community's cults was at first in the hands of the phylobasileus who, in the course of the Dark Age, was replaced by individual aristocratic families. With some possible exceptions, like the case of King Battos of Cyrene who managed to retain his land rights, this aristocratic usurpation appears to have been a general development in Greece that resulted in a kind of 'Priesteradel' responsible for community cult. Thus e.g. the Eumolpidae were in charge of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Lycomidae of those in Phlya, and the Phytalidae and Poimenidae each supervised a cult of Demeter. The effect of this kind of policy on 6th/5th century state religion was disastrous, 24</page><page sequence="10">despite occasional attempts, of which Philochorus' Law may be an example, to let the common people have a greater share in cult. But that is another story. What evidence is there in the Mycenaean world of comparable tribal or community organiza- tions which might have survived the Bronze Age as localized settlement groups and become known later under the names of phyle , genos , oikos , phratry, or orgeones ? Such communities must also have exercised the same rights concerning land tenure and cult, and possessed the legal power to sit in judgment on 'internal' community disputes like blood-guilt. I have else- where dealt with this subject in some detail and shall confine myself to summarizing the results.91 The most valuable evidence in this connexion derives from a series of tablets (the E series) discovered in the Archive Room at Pylos and dealing with land tenure, that is the administration of temene in the nine Pylian districts. Such land apparently belonged to special persons like the king, wanax, and the lawagetas, and is comparable e.g. with the temene of Alcinous in Scheria, and Odysseus in Ithaca.92 There was also public land in Pylos which belonged to the damos , i.e. the community, and could be leased from it. The usual Mycenaean title for the holder of such land was telestes (tereta) or ktoinetes', that is, he was a member of a ktoina , a word which, according to historical inscriptions from Rhodian Syme,93 described a community group. It can no longer be determined whether ktoina , telestai and damos referred to different or integrated groups; but this is an unimportant consideration, since in each case we are most likely dealing with technical expressions for communities with their land and sacral rights.94 It seems pro- bable, therefore, that ktoinetes meant the same as demotes or phy letes, i.e. a member of a com- munity with all that entails. 95 The leader of a damos was styled damokoros , 96 a title which most likely was equivalent to that of basileus ,97 and identical, or at least comparable, with phylobasileus . 98 The Pylian damos incidentally exercised the same juridical and sacral functions as the phyle and was also led by a basileus . It seems that phyle and damos were different titles of fundamentally similar communities. Damos , of course, described the community at Pakija, one of the nine districts of Messenian Pylos. Pakija , however, was a typical example of the scattered communities in Greece, which, as Thucydides, too, knew very well,99 survived the Bronze Age until synoecism. It would appear, then, that words like damos and telestai expressly point to the existence of Mycenaean community groups which, together with their legal and religious traditions, survived the rigours of the Dark Age. More research into the Linear B source material might well add other names to this list, such as orgeones and oikoi . With this kind of information enough evidence has come to hand, I think, to contradict the generally held opinion100 that the Attic phratries, gene etc. directly descended from military organizations which only came into being between the tenth and eighth centuries, through Dorian influence and because groups of loyal monarchists, or aristocratic hetairoi joined together in the common defence of the basileus . It is further argued that this kind of aristocratic military unit, whose activity is said to be reflected in the system of fighting in the Iliad, was obviously at variance with the picture of a bureaucratic army that emerges from the Mycenaean tablets. Bureaucratic or not, the Mycenaeans possessed precisely the same system of loyal, and tho- roughly militaristic, noblemen in the king's service; this much one might have gathered from the warlike history of the people. The name of such a person, however, was hepetes (eqeta) , which Palmer equates with the Homeric hetairos . 101 There is no doubt that arguments for the late development of community groups depend exclusively on a faithful belief in the Dorian monster, despite the evidence against a Dorian introduction of the phyle system with its subdivision into phratries and gene. Somehow, there- fore, the discussion of religious continuity in the Dark Age appears to be closely bound up with the defence of these much maligned people. 25</page><page sequence="11">The head of the phyle was the phylobasileus , a title that was also carried by the kings of the three Dorian tribes. 102 But the basileus happened to be an important member of the Myce- naean hierarchy, and this means that the Dorians either by accident independently coined this title, or they were familiar with Mycenaean customs before the end of the second millennium. The latter seems a more reasonable solution, for after all in the thirteenth century the Dorians and Mycenaeans spoke the same language.103 Consider, too, the Doric involvement in the Delphic myth of Deucalion and, of course, the Dorian connexion with Heracles. Both legends, as Ni Is son pointed out some thirty-five years ago, came into being in Mycenaean times, which signifies that Heracles' Doric ties could not have been invented by the Greeks in the Archaic Age in order to impose a common heritage on to the Dorians and Achaeans. Small wonder, then, that Zeus and Apollo, who had always been the special gods of the Dorians,104 were also worshipped by the Mycenaeans. Again a most sensible conclusion suggests itself from the literary evidence, once the old notion of the Dorians as destroyers of tradition is abandoned. In Homer, for example, the Dorians had settled Rhodes kataphyladon before the Trojan War, and it was from there that the Heraclid Tlepolemus sent his contingent of nine ships to support the Achaeans before Troy. 105 Further- more Herodotus' genealogy of the Dorian kings, from Deucalion to Hellen and eventually to Dorus,106 does not deal with historical personages so much as establish the rightful place of these tribes in the Mycenaean world. Traditionally the date for this presence may be as high as six generations before the Trojan War, if, as Hammond suggests, one correctly interprets another notice in Herodotus about Amphitryo, father of Heracles and son of Alcaeus. 107 No part of this discussion is necessarily intended to quarrel with the idea of the Dorians as trouble- makers late in the second millennium, but the concept of foreign intrusive elements at the time works no better really than Dessau's gold watch in Heinrich Heine's story. Should one wish to discover such an interruption in the development of Greek religion at all, the logical time would have been some thousand years earlier, at the beginning of Middle Helladic when the first Indo-European settlers may have arrived in Greece. But I am bound to admit that arguments produced at the recent Sheffield Congress have caused some grave doubts in my mind on this issue as well. 108 Rhodes University , Grahamstown NOTES 1 V. R. d'A.

Hammond, "Tumulus Burial in Albania", BS A 62 (1967) 104 and n.26. 14 An interesting linguistic reflection on historic events is the temporary influence - c. 1000 B.C. - of Doric on Ionic. Attica, according to tradition, also resisted the invaders from the north. The linguistic facts, however, would suggest that in this area, too, the Dorians left their mark. It seems that the features in which Ionic differs from Arcado-Cypriot are those which agree with Doric. The break, however, of Ionic into Attic and Ionic was a later internal development which has nothing to do with Doric dialect (Chadwick, G.&amp; R. 3 (1956) 44). For the theory that the newcomers to Attica, who infused the Doric elements into Ionic, consisted of a mixed population of Mycenaeans from the Argolid and Dorians see C. G.

Studies 125), Palaeokastro in Arcadia (Âlin, Ende 73; Styrenius, Subm. Studies 126). In Attica, apart from Athens, Salamis perhaps survived (Vermeule, Gr. in B.A. 324; but probable break during IIIB, Âlin, Ende 114; Desborough, L.M. 115), and cer- tainly Eleusis (e.g. Âlin, Ende 112 f.), Marathon (Âlin, Ende 110; 115), and Aegina (ibid. There may have been a regression of occupation during IIIB, but no complete break. But see Desborough, L.M. e.g. 119). In the Argolid continuity is probable for Mycenae, Tiryns, Argos and Asine (Âlin, Ende 10 ff.; 53), as well as, according to Vermeule, for Epidaurus, Nauplion, and Dendra (Gr. in B.A. 323). Persistence of settlement in Boeotia at present is certain only in Orchomenos and Thebes (S. Wide, "Gräberfunde aus Salamis", AthMitt 35 (1910) 17-36; A. Keramopoullos, "Thebaika", ArchDelt 3 (1917) 25ff.; Styrenius, Subm. Studies 137 f. But see Desborough, L.M. 122, for a different view).

The sites most important to the religious historian in Laconia and Phocis are Amyclae and Delphi, where apparently cult endured regardless of political changes. Outside the mainland sites we should add Knossos (e.g. Undergr. Spring Chamber, Evans, Palace of Minos II, 128 ff.; Desborough, L.M. 180), ' Phaestos (D. Levi, Annuario d. Sc.

Benton, BSA 35 (1935) 31 ff.; 40 (1945) 9 f.; Hope Simpson, Gazetteer 95; 96; Desborough, L.M. 108 ff. with reservations), and finally some Carian settlements like lasos and Halikarnassos (Annuario 39/40 (1961/2) 537; AJA 67 (1963) 185; 352. On the Dode- canese see also BSA 57 (1962) 154; Hope Simpson, Gazetteer 183 ff. Vermeule adds Tarsus, on the Cilician coast, and Enkomi, in Cyprus, to the list, Gr. in B.A. 270. For a different view on the last two sites see Desborough, L.M. 206; 198). This list would grow considerably if one remembered the important fact that interruption of settlement need not always imply the end of local cult.

II. 2, 362 f., however, is a potent argument against such a supposition unless one assumes that Nestor's phyla differed from the Doric phylai. Two examples will illustrate that most sixth century sources are not clear in their distinctions between phratry, genos , and a number of other groups in Attica: a phratry and genos may have the same law and carry a common membership register, Isaeus 7, 15-17, In the famous Demotionid decrees (IG II^ 1237) the oikos of the Dekeleies is understood as a phratry, although the former is usually counted as a subdivision of a phratry.

Phratries, he maintains, were instituted as late as 9th/8th century; but he does admit that phratries might have come to the mainland with the first Greeks but later disappeared. 89 ÓKppr|Tcop, II. 9, 63. 90 Herodotus, 4, 161. 91 4 4 Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Cult Continuity", Acta Classica 11 (1968) 153-69. 92 Od. 6, 293; 11,185. 93 IG XII (0.694; 157.9; XI I (3).1270 A13 . 94 E.g.
