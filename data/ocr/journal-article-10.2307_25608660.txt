Introduction: The discovery During the excavations in Nineveh carried out by R. Campbell Thompson on behalf of the British Museum in the years 1929 to 1932, many glazed Assyrian bricks were recovered and partly published in the excavation reports.1 Bricks were found in the years 1927-8 and 1929-30, respect ively, when the Temple of Nabu and the so-called Palace of Assurnasirpal II were being excavated. Bricks were said to have come from the South-East area of the Temple of Nabu, where the excavators thought they had found the palace of King Assurnasirpal II.2 Actually, as recognised then by Thompson himself, the area between the temples of Nabu and Ishtar, where the palace of Assurnasirpal was thought to be, is characterised by later installations that reused Assyrian materials and structures (Fig. la-b).3 Confusion is due to the frequent presence of the word e.gal ("palace") at the beginning of the inscription that was stamped onto the bricks. However, the word e.gal probably does not refer to a palace proper, but was used as a production mark: the brick was produced by and/or within the administrative structure ("palace") of the Assyrian king, whose name usually follows the word e.gal ("palace" of + Assyrian king's name), independently from its final location or use either for a palace or a temple.4 Thus, as reconstructed by Julian Reade,5 the Temple of Ishtar should be considered the likely source for the Assyrian materials found when excavating the South-East quadrant in the years 1927-8 and 1929-30, although the Temple of Nabu itself cannot a priori be totally excluded.6 Painted bricks should, therefore, be considered as possible decoration of the two main temples in Nineveh, as it was for the temples built by Sargon II in Khorsabad. The location of the bricks in the area between the two temples on the mound of Kuyunjik seems to suggest they were used for decoration of outer facades. Once the temples were no longer in use, the bricks on the outer walls probably collapsed and were reused as filling material in post-Assyrian structures. It is also possible that they were dismantled and taken from other places in the abandoned sanctuaries of Nabu and Ishtar, for example from the inner courtyards in front of the shrines.7 The bricks, now mainly stored in the British Museum in London, bear the registration TH 1929, TH 1930 and TH 1932, indicating that they were excavated by Campbell Thompson in the years 1929 to 1932 in Nineveh; although the date of registration of the museum does not always correspond to the date of excavation, it seems that, in this case, it does correspond. Some of them depict narrative scenes, very poorly and fragmentarily preserved, showing sieges, transport of booty, processions of prisoners, marching Assyrian soldiers and presumably the royal chariot.8 Others represent very characteristic geometrical features such as circles, chevrons and guilloche patterns, painted in black and white, that can be reconstructed either as decorations of architectural elements such as archways, external doors and gates, or as frames of complex narrative scenes composed of different bricks assembled together.9 All can be dated to the ninth century bc. Since these painted bricks date to the ninth century bc, they can be rightly considered part of Assurnasirpal IPs work on the Temple of Ishtar, as claimed by the Assyrian king in his inscrip * Sapienza ?

They were found by Thompson while he was excavating the South-East Quadrant of the Temple of Nabu (the supposed Assurnasirpal Palace) and they could thus also have belonged to the Temple of Ishtar.12 Moreover, textual references seem to show the existence of a bit akitu sanctuary on the main mound of Kuyunjik: texts referring to the construction, restoration and embellishment of the bit akitu of the goddess are registered as coming from the area between the temples of Nabu and Ishtar, exactly where the bricks were found as fill in post-Assyrian chambers. Evidence of the possible existence of a bit akitu on Kuyunjik dates back to Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1233-1197 bc). There are some bricks referring to Tukulti-Ninurta I as a builder of the house of Ishtar (bani bit Ishtar).13 E. Frahm has recognised a possible reference to the previous work of Tukulti-Ninurta I in a broken text dated to Adad-Nirari III (810-783 bc)14 which probably refers to the construc tion of the bit akitu.15 Moreover, an inscription carved on a limestone slab, recently dated to Sargon II by Frahm,16 refers to a bit akitu: Assurbanipal's inscriptions indicate that Sargon II was one of the first builders of the bit akitu of the goddess Ishtar in Nineveh.17 Finally, Assurbanipal himself records his own work and restoration, providing the bit akitu with glazed bricks repre senting his military deeds.18 Assurbanipal seems to devote particular attention to the reconstruction of the bit akitu of the goddess in Nineveh. In fact, he points out that "das Akltu-Haus das seit der Zeit meiner koniglichen Vorvater vergessen und nicht nach den alten Brauchen so wie fruher errichtet worden war".19 Assurbanipal's Vorvater is doubtless Sennacherib. An inscription dated to Sennacherib and found reused in the Nergal Gate of Nineveh mentions the construction of a bit akitu, Eshahullezenzagmukam,20 that Frahm suggests could have been located outside the city walls, north of the Nergal Gate.21 Thus, following Frahm's reconstruction, Sennacherib moved the bit akitu outside Nineveh, while Assurbanipal restored the bit akitu inside the city,22 the one that had been built by Sargon II. It is impossible to reconstruct Esarhaddon's contribution to the bit akitu of Ishtar in Nineveh: he merely states that he worked on the bit akitu of Ishtar.23 He gives no information as to which bit akitu (inside or outside the city), that is, if there was more than one. In fact, there is no archaeological evidence to support the existence of a bit akitu on the mound of Kuyunjik.24 Based on the place where epigraphic data were recovered on the site, it might be suggested that the bit akitu was "somewhere north or west of the main temple",25 but all this is hypothetical. Moreover, the epigraphic evidence just quoted is incomplete and merely refers to a bit akitu without any explicit indication that the bricks and stone slabs bearing such a reference belonged to the bit akitu of Kuyunjik. At the same time, the possibility that the glazed bricks found by Thompson could be related to a supposed bit akitu is also pure hypothesis. 10Grayson 1991: A.0.101.40, 11. 30b-37; A.0.101.45. See also the numerous bricks of Assurnasirpal II mentioning his work on the Temple of Ishtar. The inscriptions stamped on some bricks repeat the usual formula "palace of" at the beginning (see fn. 4); others specify that the brick belongs to the temple of the goddess in Nineveh (ibid.: A.0.101.112, A.0.101.126). Matthiae (2002: 578-80) recently suggested that Assurnasirpal IFs bricks representing scenes of warfare might also be considered part of the decoration of the palace restored by Tiglath-Pileser I on Kuyunjik, next to the terrace of the Ishtar Temple: Tiglath-Pileser I claims in his inscriptions that he restored a palace that an unnamed predecessor had built and that his father, Mutakkil-Nusku, had restored when it became dilapidated (Grayson 1991: A.0.87.10, 11. 71-88; Matthiae 2002: 569). Thus, according to Matthiae's hypothesis, Assurnasirpal II, who did not build any palace in Nineveh (1998: 51-6; 2002: 575), might have worked on a pre-existing palace embellishing it with narrative scenes depicted on glazed bricks. The choice of glazed bricks seems particularly interesting if we consider also that Tiglath-Pileser I records the use of glazed bricks in his inscriptions to decorate his palace (Reade 1979: 19; 1981: 147; Matthiae 1996a: 5-7; 2002: 569). 11 Reade 2005: 375-8, Figs. 16 and 19. 12 Thompson and Hutchinson 1929a: 81; 1931: 82-3. 13 Grayson 1987: A.0.78.33; Frahm 2000: 77; Reade 2005: 372. 14Thompson and Hamilton 1932: 103, No. 219, PI.

The bricks in detail: Iconography and subject-matter The most interesting characteristic of these bricks, despite their iconographical features, is the special way they are made. In fact, they are high-relief bricks and do not show narrative scenes; the pieces stored in the British Museum mostly bear representations of vegetal elements together with the lower part of a bull's leg. Other fragments, stored in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, represent the modelled frontal face of what is probably a large composite figure (a sphinx?),26 and the profile of a bare-headed male whose right hand is raised in the finger-snapping gesture.27 In the following short catalogue, we selected the high-relief bricks stored in the British Museum, and a single piece in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. All the bricks are marked with the registration TH 1929, that is they come from the first season of excavation (1927-8) carried out by Thompson at Nineveh. We do not consider here the high-relief modelled frontal face since it seems to have a different significance and cannot be linked to the other high-relief bricks showing vegetal elements. However, we decided to insert the Baghdad piece depicting the male figure since it fits with the possible meaning of the bricks, as will be demonstrated. No. 1. British Museum Number: TH 1929-10-12, 192 (Fig. 2) Width: 34.5 cm; Height: 13.5 cm; Thickness: 10.2 cm Preservation: fragment. Colour: yellowish-brown brick with meagre traces of yellow, white and blue paint. Subject: high-relief representation of a bull's leg. Notes: the representation shows the composite nature of high-relief bricks, many of which are part of a larger figure. In the excavation reports, it is said that the piece comes from near Assurnasirpal's palace, actually the area between the temples of Nabu and Ishtar.28 The bull originally faced right. No. 2. British Museum Number: TH 1929-10-12, 194 (Fig. 3) Width: 15.6 cm; Height: 13.4 cm; Thickness: 7.5 cm Preservation: fragment. The upper and lower surfaces as well as one side of the brick are preserved. Bubbles on the surface probably indicate a faulty glazing process.29 Colour: light yellow paint on yellowish-brown brick. Subject: high-relief representation of fig-tree leaves with round fruit painted in yellow. Notes: on the upper part and one side of the brick, the pencil annotation of the provenance is barely visible: XIX [...]. Because of the presence of the Roman numeral, the brick must come from Thompson's excavation campaign in the area of Nabu Temple in 1929, where Roman numerals were used to designate sections or slices in a radial system.30 Thompson's excavation in 1929 also covered the area between the temples of Nabu and Ishtar where the Palace of Assurnasirpal II was supposed to have been located. The palace was later excavated in the years 1929-30, when the radial system with Roman numerals was abandoned.31 No. 3. British Museum Number: TH 1929-10-12, 204 (Fig. 4) Width: 15.7 cm; Height: 11 cm; Thickness: 6.9 cm Preservation: fragment. Colour: yellowish-brown brick with orange, yellow and white paint. Subject: high-relief palm leaves painted in white with orange borders. Notes: the fragment can be associated with brick TH 1929-10-12, 212 (No. 7), also depicting a palm tree with leaves. The two fragments, moreover, share the same style and colours. 26 Thompson and Hutchinson 1931: PI. XXVI.2; Nunn 1988: 171, Taf. 131. 27Nunn 1988: 171, Taf. 132. 28 Thompson and Hutchinson 1929b: PI.

Campbell and R. W. Hutchinson 1931: PI. XXVI.4). Notes: a drawing of the brick was published by Thompson, who, however, does not give any information either about its preservation or paint. The letter B next to the caption identifies the piece as being in Baghdad.32 3. The meaning of the depiction: A hypothesis An interesting point is the fact that the human and animal representations face in different directions: the bull's leg indicates a figure facing right (Fig. 2), the male head faces left (Fig. 9). Thus, as suggested by the bronze bands of Sargon II at Khorsabad,33 the Nineveh bricks were probably part of symmetrical decoration, perhaps parts of decoration flanking the two sides of a doorway or of the stairs leading to a platform. Recently, Julian Reade compared the subject-matter of the high-relief bricks from Nineveh with those from Khorsabad dated to the time Sargon II. He went further in suggesting that these bricks from Nineveh "look like another royal name, from another temple facade".34 Indeed, the bricks from Nineveh share some interesting features with the bricks from Khorsabad,35 except that the latter are not in high-relief. At the same time, they also share many interesting features with Esarhaddon's symbols carved on the so-called Black Stone (BM ME 91027, Fig. \0a-h) and impressed on the ends of prisms in the British Museum (BM ME 78223 and BM ME 78247) and the Metropolitan Museum of New York (MMA 86.11.83).36 It is particularly noteworthy that they share the motifs of vegetal elements, a bull and a man. Taken together, and on the basis of the decrypted symbols of Sargon II, we can suggest that the vegetal elements of the Nineveh bricks with leaves and round fruit might represent the fig-tree that symbolizes the land (matu);31 then the two fragments of a palm, a subject we find among Esarhaddon's symbols, should be an indirect pictogram standing for Sumer and Akkad and, more generally, for Babylonia and "Lower Mesopotamia".38 The bare-headed man with his right hand raised does not appear among Sargon's symbols, but it seems to be exactly like one of Esarhaddon's symbols where a bare-headed man stands for the representation of the king, who is depicted without any royal headdress on both the Black Stone and the impressions on the prisms.39 32Thompson and Hutchinson 1931: PI. XXVI.4; Reade 2005: Fig. 21. 33 Finkel and Reade 1996: 253. 34 Reade 2005: 381. 35Miglus 1994: 182; Reade 1995: 234-6; Finkel and Reade 1996: 247-50, Fig. 1; Scurlock 1997; Roaf and Zgoll 2001: Fig. 3. 36Miglus 1994; Finkel and Reade 1996: 254-6, Figs. 21-4; Roaf and Zgoll 2001. 37 Finkel and Reade 1996: 249; Roaf and Zgoll 2001: 282-3. Although fragmentary, pieces No. 2 and No. 4 seem to represent fig-tree leaves and fruit, and not vines with grapes (Thompson and Hutchinson 1929a: 81; Nunn 1988: 172; see the bas-relief representations of vines, Bleibtreu 1980: 131-9, with pointed leaves and bunches of grapes): in fact, taking into consideration the representations on the bas-reliefs of the Assyrian palaces (ibid.: 142-7), leaves are round and not pointed and fruits are represented as single, and not as a bunch, the round fruits could be identified as figs (ibid.: 186-7). Nevertheless, No. 6 seems more likely to represent a bunch of grapes. As far as we know, no vines with grapes appear among the symbols of Sargon II and Esarhaddon. The tree on Sargon's bricks at Khorsabad has been identified as a fig-tree (Finkel and Reade 1996: 249, 251, Abb. 10; Reade 1995: 235, Fig. 14). 38 Finkel and Reade 1996: 260. 39 Finkel and Reade 1996: 256; Roaf and Zgoll 2001: 271-2. See Scurlock (1997: 85), who interprets the figure of the man on the Black Stone differently. Since the figure does not wear a tiara and diadem, she does not think that</page><page sequence="10">96 davide nadali Fig. \0a Black Stone of Lord Aberdeen, British Museum, ME 91027 (after Finkel and Reade 1996: Fig. 19). Fig. \0b Drawing of the Black Stone of Lord Aberdeen (after Roaf and Zgoll 2001: Fig. 1). Based on the known and deciphered examples of Sargon and Esarhaddon, the Nineveh bricks should express a royal name, using symbols ("hieroglyphs"), and be viewed in the following order: the man with bare head (No. 8), the palm tree (Nos. 3 and 7), the bull (No. 1) and the (fig-)tree (Nos. 2, 4, 5-6), following an arrangement similar to that on Esarhaddon's Black Stone.40 Thus, the inscription, although incomplete, if compared with the known examples of Sargon and Esarhaddon,41 can be interpreted as the name of a king followed by his title. We do not know exactly whence such a tradition of symbolic writing derived, although the Assyrians, at least from the eighth century bc, were well aware of the hieroglyphic systems of writing used by the Hittites, Urartians and, of course, the Egyptians.42 Indeed, writing by means of symbols is found throughout Mesopotamian history for the names of people, cities and deities on a variety of artefacts.43 The evident similarity of the symbols of both Sargon and Esarhaddon brings us to the next step in this research: the chronology of the bricks coming from the area between the temples of Nabu and Ishtar at Nineveh. the figure is a representation of the king. She interprets the pictogram as meaning "brother" instead of "king", forming the second element of Esarhaddon's name ("the god Assur has given a brother"). In Scurlock's reading (1997: 85-6, followed also by Roaf and Zgoll 2001: 271), the first three symbols represent Esarhaddon's name: the horned crown on the altar (= "Assur") + the man (= "brother") + the sacred tree (="has given"). Conversely, Finkel and Reade (1996: 258-59) reconstruct Esarhaddon's name with the first four symbols, thus including the bull (="has given") and interpret the sacred tree as the pictogram for "brother"; the horned crown on the altar and the man together produce the first element of Esarhaddon's name ("Assur"), written in the archaizing orthography an.sar (ibid.: 259). 40The fig-tree stands for mcitu ("land"), according to the reading of Finkel and Reade (1996: 249). However, the fig-tree is a symbol peculiar to Sargon IPs bricks and does not figure among Esarhaddon's symbols. Roaf and Zgoll (2001: 283) believe that the pictogram of the mountain, carved on the Black Stone and stamped on Esarhaddon's prisms, corresponds to the fig-tree on Sargon's inscriptions; thus it has the same meaning, matu ("land"). According to this interpretation, the fig-tree should be substituted for the mountain in the sequence of symbols. Compare Esarhaddon's prisms, which substitute lion for bull, both having the value of "king" (Finkel and Reade 1996: 255-6). 41 Unlike Sargon's glazed bricks, the bricks from Nineveh do not record the representation of the king himself, the lion, the bird, the plough and the human figure pointing his spear at the ground. The Esarhaddon symbols carved on the Black Stone and stamped on his prisms, include the horned crown on an altar, the sacred tree, the mountain, the plough and the square symbol that are also missing on Nineveh representations. Obviously, the presence or absence of pieces in the sequence of symbols can depend on the archaeological context from which they come. It is signific ant that the bricks were found by the British archaeologists in fill in post-Assyrian structures between the temples of Nabu and Ishtar. 42 Finkel and Reade 1996: 245; Roaf and Zgoll 2001: 291. 43 See, for example, the enigmatic symbols carved on the so-called "City Seals" of the Jemdet Nasr/ED I Period (Matthews 1993: 33-4, 48). Recently, J. S. Cooper, in a lecture he gave in Rome (December 2006), suggested that the symbols carved on the upper register of the Warka Vase could be interpreted as writing symbols. On the subject, see a recent essay by D. Schmandt-Besserat, When Writing Met Art, University Texas Press, 2007. On the use of symbols in the Assyrian religious world, see Oman 2005.</page><page sequence="11">assyrian high-relief bricks from nineveh and the fragments of a royal name 97 4. Chronology I: Sargon II or Esarhaddon? Since the symbols depicted on the bricks from Nineveh share common features with the symbols of both Sargon II and Esarhaddon, it is almost impossible to date them precisely. In favour of an attribution to Sargon is the fact that the Nineveh bricks depict the fig-tree as do Sargon's bricks from Khorsabad, whereas the fig-tree is totally absent from the known Esarhaddon examples.44 Furthermore, Sargon II is known to have worked in Nineveh on the reconstruction of the Nabu Temple, the restoration of the Temple of Ishtar and the building of the bit akitu of the goddess.45 Also, the use of glazed bricks to decorate the outer facades of the temples in Khorsabad would point to Sargon II as the author of the Nineveh bricks. However, based on both iconographical characteristics and on the peculiar high-relief of the Nineveh bricks,46 these should probably be dated to reign of Esarhaddon. Two iconographical features seem to favour such a dating: Esarhaddon worked on the Temple of Ishtar at Nineveh, as previously noted,47 and a comparison with the symbols carved on the so-called Black Stone and on the ends of some prisms of Esarhaddon indicate that the symbols from Nineveh could be interpreted as the writing of Esarhaddon's name on bricks from the facade of the Ishtar Temple. In particular, fragment No. 8 (Fig. 9) can be considered, in our opinion, as a distinctive mark in favour of an Esarhaddon dating. The argument goes as follows. On the bricks from Khorsabad, Sargon wears the typical royal tiara that helps to identify the figure of the king.48 Also, on Sargon's bronze bands, the human figure, depicted on fragment A between two bulls in the posture of the Master of Animals, can be identified as the king because he wears the tall fez.49 Now compare the human figure depicted in front of the altar on the Black Stone and Esarhaddon's prisms: he does not wear any headdress, and nor does the human figure depicted on our fragment No. 8. Also, both the figure on fragment No. 8 and the human figure on Esarhaddon's symbols raise the right hand in the same gesture and snap their fingers in a peculiarly Assyrian fashion. As interpreted by Finkel and Reade, the human figure in Esarhaddon's pictograms stands for the cuneiform sign lugal = sarru, "king",50 and, although there are differences in the use of the symbols between the Black Stone and the prisms,51 the human figure standing for the king is represented as bare-headed on all the examples.52 The second iconographical feature concerns the representation of the palm. The palm fronds of fragments 3 and 7 (Figs. 4 and 8) seem to fit with the depiction of palm trees on Esarhaddon's Black Stone and prisms.53 Palm trees are not, actually, among Sargon's symbols, either on the bricks or on the bronze bands, at least not on the known fragments. Thus, basing the analysis and comparison on iconographical features, the collective evidence brings us to the conclusion that the bricks from Nineveh can reasonably be dated to Esarhaddon's time. There is yet another aspect based on iconography that seems to confirm the dating of the bricks to Esarhaddon. The Nineveh bricks are all characterised by depictions in high-relief that have no parallels in Assyria. Sargon's bricks at Khorsabad depict similar symbols, as we have seen, but they are flat. As pointed out by Julian Reade, the high-relief bricks found at Nineveh by Thompson represent "a new technique in Assyria".54 Whence does high-relief moulding originate? Can we find this tradition elsewhere in Mesopotamia and link it to Assyria? High-relief bricks are, in fact, documented in southern Mesopotamia beginning in the Old Babylonian period. In the so-called "Treasury" of Ur, built by the king of Larsa, Sin-iddinam, were found a number of fallen high-relief bricks, with geometrical design. They were probably used as decoration of the upper part of the walls of the building, for example as crenellations.55 44 Finkel and Reade 1996: 254-61. See also fn. 40. 45Matthiae 1998: 57; Reade 2005: 380. 46Nunn (1988: 171-2, 184) erroneously dates the high relief bricks of Nineveh to Assurnasirpal II together with the bricks with scenes of warfare that are surely dated to the 9th century bc. She proposes Assurnasirpal II, because (moulded) semi-circular bricks, from recessed half-columns, have been found by Iraqi archaeologists in the excavations of the inner courtyard Y of Assurnasirpal IFs North-West Palace at Nimrud (ibid. : 172; Reade 1979: 20; see Nimrud, in Iraq 35, 1973, p. 193). 47 Reade 2000: 409. 48 Finkel and Reade 1996: 248. 49Ibid.: 251, Fig. 10. 50Ibid.: 258.

Contemporary Kassite high-relief bricks are also known from Ur, Dur-Kurigalzu, Nippur and Isin. These examples document the widespread use of the technique for embellishing the outer walls of temples (for example at Dur-Kurigalzu) and sacred structures (as in the temenos at Ur).58 Indeed, in Mesopotamia the outer facades of temples were decorated with alternating niches and buttresses from very early times and the enrichment of these with high-relief bricks in the Old Babylonian and Kassite periods was a continuation of this tradition. Also in the Kassite period, the kudurrus59 have symbols carved on them that seem to be part of this tradition of abstract representation, culminating in the use of symbols for writing the names of kings in the Neo-Assyrian period. The Kassite artists created and used symbols to represent deities in marked contrast to the anthropomorphic depictions of deities in relief on temple walls of the same period (Ishtar Temple at Warka).60 Such symbols represent the character istics of each divinity, from astral to chthonic. They document a marked progression towards abstraction and synthesis in the progressive, although not exclusive, route from anthropomorphic to non-anthropomorphic depictions of gods.61 Symbols are a syncretistic expression of religion. They summarize the main characteristics of a deity and stand for the deity. The tendency to represent deities with symbols was particularly widespread in the Kassite period, and is reflected also in some monuments of the Late Babylonian period, as in the stelae-fcwrfwrrws of Marduk zakir-shumi I (ninth century bc)62, and Marduk-apla-iddina II (dated to 715 bc ? a contemporary of Sargon II and of Sennacherib).63 Thus, Assyrian kings could have been influenced by the Babylonian tradition in both the use of high-relief bricks (Kassite period and earlier) and in the development of symbols to represent gods (kudurru reliefs). We should remember that Assyrian artists used symbols representing deities on most of the Assyrian stelae and rock reliefs.64 We now know that Sargon II and Esarhaddon also adopted the use of symbols, but these were different from those used to represent deities. On both Babylonian and Assyrian monuments, these kings wrote their names and royal titles in connection with temples, as documented at Khorsabad by the bricks and bronze bands of Sargon II, and at Nineveh according to the proposed dating of the Nineveh bricks to Esarhaddon advocated here.65 Therefore, if we take into consideration a possible Babylonian tradition of the use of high-relief bricks, starting in the Old Babylonian period, through the Kassite and into the Late Babylonian period, culminating in the famous high-relief bricks of the Ishtar Gate in Babylon, and combine it with the evidence for the use of symbols in Babylonian iconography, then the use of high-relief bricks at Nineveh could have been influenced by a specifically Babylonian practice. Moreover, historical evidence would further support a dating to Esarhaddon. Esarhaddon was involved in reconstructing Babylon, in favouring and protecting Babylonian citizens, and in presenting himself as a good Babylonian ruler, as is clearly indicated in the text carved on the so-called Black Stone.66 Indeed, Esarhaddon's Black Stone (BM ME 91027) emphasises, both iconographically and textually, how the Assyrian king cared specifically for Babylonian traditions and for Babylon itself, in contrast to his father's policy. The symbols carved on the upper part of the Black Stone, as well the material used (black limestone), explicitly recall a Babylonian kudurru. At the same time, as pointed out by Porter in her insightful analysis,67 although the Black Stone had been conceived as a typical Babylonian object (like a kudurru), it remained characteristically Assyrian 56 Reade 1979: 20. 57 Dolce 1988: 41-2. 58 Dolce 1988: 43; Baffi and Dolce 1990: 159-60; Woolley 1965: 64; Kraus 1952: Fig. on p. 74; Hrouda 1978: 87. 59 Seidl 1989. 60Dolce 1988: 46; Oman 2005: 18-19. 61 Oman 2005:20, 45-50, 171. 62 Seidl 1989: 57. 63 Seidl 1989: 107; Strommenger and Hirmer 1962: Taf. 274; Matthiae 1996b: 165. 64B6rker-Klahn 1982: No. 135-7,154,161,163-5,180-5, 202-4, 219. 65 Porter 1993a: 196-7. 66Porter 1993a; 1993b: 41-75. 67 Porter 1993a: 195-6.</page><page sequence="13">assyrian high-relief bricks from nineveh and the fragments of a royal name 99 as regards the text, the shape of the object and the symbols used. Thus, Esarhaddon adopted a Babylonian attitude but maintained a strong Assyrian character. For example, except for the horned crown on an altar, the other symbols do not find any parallels among those usually depicted on the Babylonian kudurru.68 In contrast with the practice on kudurrus, the symbols used by both Sargon II and Esarhaddon do not stand for representations of deities, but they assume different values to express the king's name and titulary. The symbols, used as a rebus-writing of Esarhaddon's name at Nineveh, as well as those of Sargon II at Khorsabad, are based on a strong Assyrian tradition, although the widespread use of symbols in southern Mesopotamia may have influenced Assyrian culture. In fact, Sargon's policy was also particularly pro-Babylonian with grants and privileges for the citizens of Babylon, as indicated in his royal inscriptions.69 After his twelfth military campaign in the south,70 Sargon also became King of Babylon, attended the New Year Festival in front of Marduk and offered important and precious gifts to the temples.71 As a result, he could well have been influenced by a southern tradition in his use of symbols to express concepts such as writing names in an allegorical way, either copying a Babylonian tradition or involving Babylonian workmen in Assyria, for instance in the construction of Dur Sharrukin. However, Sargon's bricks are flat, as are many other glazed bricks found in Assyria, thus adhering to a peculiarly Assyrian shape. In contrast, the bricks found near the Ishtar Temple in Nineveh are in high-relief, and we have suggested looking south where such a tradition is well attested in the second millennium bc. Esarhaddon, because of the iconographical features previ ously considered, seems to be a more plausible candidate. Moreover, he sponsored strong building activities in Babylon, commemorating his projects in many inscriptions. He wished to present himself as a good Babylonian ruler accepted by the Babylonians, particularly after the disastrous rupture caused by his father's policy.72 As a consequence, he employed Babylonian tools and traditions and transferred such an attitude to Assyria.73 5. Chronology II: Assurbanipal and the Elamite origin of high-relief bricks The use of high-relief bricks is not only a Babylonian prerogative of the Old Babylonian, Kassite and Late Babylonian periods. Contemporary with the Kassite artistic and architectural experience in Mesopotamia, high-relief bricks are also attested in Elam. Indeed, King Sin-iddinam of Larsa, who was responsible for the high-relief decorations of the "Treasury" of Ur, had ancestors with Elamite names.74 Thus the use of high-relief bricks in the Middle Elamite period (fifteenth to thirteenth centuries bc) seems to continue a tradition already attested in the Old Babylonian period. The most significant examples come from Susa, although in a disturbed archaeological context. A facade of the Temple of Inshushinak was decorated, during the reign of Shilhak Inshushinak (twelfth century bc), with moulded bricks representing a frontal female deity and a bull-man grasping a date palm.75 Other fragments of high-relief bricks, also dating to the reign of Shilhak-Inshushinak, depict a royal couple.76 All examples from Elam (Susa) are dated to the twelfth century bc, when the power of the Kassites in Mesopotamia started to decrease. It may be that the Kassite tradition of using moulded bricks as architectural decoration of temple facades passed to Elam. Perhaps the Elamite ancestors of Sin-iddinam of Larsa, who used high-relief bricks to decorate the "Treasury" of Ur, were the possible Elamite transmitters of the idea of the high-relief brick that then passed back to Babylonia and Assyria.77 As a result, it is impossible to ascertain the origin of high-relief bricks, although southern Mesopotamia and Elam represent the area of the invention and development of moulded bricks for architectural decoration from the second millennium bc onwards ? a tradition that continued 68 Ibid.: 196. 69 Fuchs 1994: 32, 45. 70Ibid.: 399-405. 71 Porter 1997: 256-7; Fales 2001: 29-30.

Assurbanipal's texts record that the Assyrian king restored and decorated with glazed bricks the bit akitu of Ishtar in Nineveh, specifying that the bricks represented his military deeds.80 However, the high-relief bricks found by Thompson, when he excavated the Ishtar Temple and the so-called "Palace of Assurnasirpal",81 do not show narrative scenes. The only narrative examples ? which must be dated to the ninth century bc (Assurnasirpal II)82 ? are not high-relief bricks. High-relief bricks were found by Rassam when working in the North Palace of Assurbanipal at Nineveh.83 Reade wrote that an unglazed moulded brick representing a sphinx (BM ME 138719; Fig. 11) should be part of Rassam's discoveries in the North Palace.84 Thus, Assurbanipal seems to have used high-relief bricks as architectural decoration, either following a tradition already introduced by Esarhaddon, or by himself borrowing this practice from Babylonia and/or Elam. In the account of his fifth and last campaign against Elam, Assurbanipal lists the captives and consigns the best to the gods:85 texts report that among the prisoners there were workmen that were probably employed as a work force in constructing and restoring temples (gods = temples).86 Thus, it is not improbable that workmen carried from Elam as prisoners of war worked for the king in Assyria, bringing with them their own cultural background and architectural practices, such as the use of moulded bricks as architectural decoration. Instead of a cultural influence from the south to Assyria, the introduction of high-relief in Assyria could be due to the presence of foreign builders who worked in Assyria and brought their experience and skill with them. 6. Conclusion The moulded bricks found by Thompson between the temples of Nabu and Ishtar (Fig. \b) represent a particularly interesting discovery if we consider all the arguments we have just presented. First, they document another case of rebus-writing in addition to those already known from the reigns of Sargon II and Esarhaddon. Second, they represent, as rightly observed by Reade, a new technique in Assyria, borrowed either from southern Mesopotamia (Babylonia) or from Elam. Third, they show the continuing use of such a decorative technique, suited for the embellishment of architectural features and the outer facades of temples and palaces throughout 78 Harper, Aruz and Tallon 1992: 223-5, No. 155-7, 165, 169. 79Strommenger and Hirmer 1962: Taf. 275-8, XLIII XLIV; Nunn 1988: 185-99. 80 See fn. 18. 81 Reade 2000: 416. 82 Nunn 1988: 169-70; Reade 2005: 378. 83Rassam 1897: 222-3; Reade 1979: 20; 2005: 381; Nunn 1988: 184. 84 Reade 2005: 381.

In this case, they were probably arranged in a horizontal line "spelling" the king's name and titulary. Some fragments clearly indicate that they were part of a more complex composition (for example, leaves and fruits appear together with tree-trunks), and fitter's marks were painted on the sides of bricks for the correct positioning.88 Despite their fragmentary condition and the difficulties in reconstructing their original location, leading to the proposal of different chronological interpretations, it seems to us that Esarhaddon can be considered as the Assyrian king responsible for the high-relief bricks found in Nineveh. Although Sargon's examples of rebus-writing of the king's name are known from Khorsabad, and Assurbanipal probably also employed high-relief bricks in his palace, iconographical details and the high moulding technique seem to point to Esarhaddon. Among the pieces recovered by Thompson, fragment No. 8 (Fig. 9) seems to confirm an Esarhaddon dating. The brick in high-relief represents the bare-headed man which is also among the symbols forming Esarhaddon's name carved on the Black Stone and stamped on his prisms. That figure, which was the subject of different interpretations and readings as a symbol,89 seems to characterize Esarhaddon's rebus-writing, while the human figure represented as worshipper on Sargon's bricks, and as master of the animals on Sargon's bronze bands, always wears the royal headgear and would seem to be a representation of the king himself in a specific context. I have proposed that the high-relief technique demonstrates southern Babylonian influence that came to Assyria particularly in Esarhaddon's time, when the Assyrian king devoted himself to the reconstruction of the city of Babylon, destroyed by his father Sennacherib, and to re-establishing privileges for Babylonian citizens. Indeed, the Black Stone seems also to point to this aspect of Esarhaddon's policy. Moreover, Esarhaddon himself refers, in his inscriptions, to the use of a rebus-writing system that he calls lumasi symbols.90 That term has been interpreted as "constellations"91 thus suggesting the new term "astroglyphs" in current studies.92 He also described as "black stone" and (baked) clay the materials of the documents on which he wrote his name using the lumasi symbols, and these can be linked to the material of the Black Stone, on one hand, and to the prisms, on the other.93 At the same time, we wonder whether baked documents of clay, apparently the prisms, could not also refer to (baked) glazed bricks. In conclusion, despite the chronological hypothesises proposed here relating to Sargon II (similar symbols at Khorsabad and Babylonian influence), and to Assurbanipal (the use of high-relief bricks),94 and despite the fact that both kings worked in Nineveh on the Ishtar Temple, the Nineveh relief bricks still seem to indicate that Esarhaddon was the king who embellished a temple at Nineveh with them. He used the rebus system to write his name, he made explicit reference in his inscriptions to this way of writing, and at least one iconographic motif is only attested among Esarhaddon's symbols (Fig. 9). As regards the origin of the use of moulded bricks in architecture, we prefer Babylonia as the place that influenced Assyria. Such a tradition goes back to the second millennium bc ? manifest from the Kassite period (or even earlier, in the Old Babylonian period) ? and seems to characterize Babylonian architectural techniques until the latest periods. Esarhaddon had close links with Babylon, and consequently Assyria's political ideology and religion were influenced by Babylonian thought.95 The moulding technique and the use of high-relief bricks in architecture, in particular for temples and religious edifices, can be considered one of the changes that occurred in Assyria and derived from Esarhaddon's active policy in the South. 87 Glazed bricks with narrative scenes are also attested next to the more common use of bas-reliefs (Nadali 2006). 88 Russell 1999: 97-9. 89Seefn. 39. 90 Borger 1956: 27-8, Episode 40. 91 Luckenbill 1925. 92Roaf and Zgoll 2001.

Reade (2005: 381) suggests they could be surplus stock from a temple (the temple of Ishtar?). 95 See, for example, the representation of Assurbanipal as "basket-bearing king" following a very ancient ritual and iconography of southern Mesopotamia (Porter 2003: 47-58).</page><page sequence="16">102 DAVIDE NADALI Acknowledgements This research has been funded by a scholarship of the Italian Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and by the British Academy.
