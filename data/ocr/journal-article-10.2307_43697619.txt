<plain_text><page sequence="1">Virtual Vision vs. Actual Show: Strategies of Visualization in the Book of Ezekiel Christoph Uehlinger Summary This paper addresses different ways of handling and manipulating visuality as displayed by the book of Ezekiel in reports on Vision' (especially chs. 1, 10) and so-called 'sign acts' (es- pecially chs. 4-5). In the central part, I summarize and update my previous studies, which followed a strictly historical-critical approach combining biblical exegesis with iconography and other ancient Near Eastern background materials. The introduction and conclusion ad- dress more theory-driven questions related to visuality, gaze, and visual culture. It is argued that ancient texts may reflect the particular visual environments in which they were au- thored or transmitted, and that the texts under review here display distinct visual culture backgrounds (roughly: Babylonian, Levantine, Egyptian), which may inform us on differ- ent locations of both authors/redactors and audiences; that ancient scribes may have been more or less exposed to such visual regimes, and hence their writings seem to be more or less familiar with visual features; that visualization serves different aims and strategies of communication when vision or 'sign acts' are reported; and that the reports also imply dif- ferent cognitive stances (prophetic insight based on scholarly knowledge vs. persuasive per- formance) towards the objects of vision which they put on show before their readers' mind. A personal, and epistemological, preliminary This article originated as an invited paper presented at the SBL seminar on "The book of Ezekiel in its Babylonian context", held during the SBL Annual Meeting at Chicago in November 2012. I am grateful to the organizers for inviting me to speak at that session, and to those who took on them the burden of editing the proceedings.1 Let me point out that I had accepted their invita- tion with mixed feelings. Having touched on the book of Ezekiel in occasional 1 I am grateful to Corrine L. Carvalho and Dalit Rom-Shiloni for taking the initiative, Madhavi Mevader and Martti Nissinen for witty and stimulating comments during the seminar, and to Bernd U. Schipper for having patiently but unremittingly insisted to get my thoughts pub- lished even in a somehow sketchy state of conceptualization. The paper has not been substan- tially modified, except that I have added some footnotes to point out how much my thoughts rely on the work of others. For more up-to-date scholarship, readers should turn to a vol- ume announced at the time of final editing: Paul M.

In that new institutional setting, concerned with History of Religions/Comparative Religion, other areas of study have since required my full attention.5 The book of Ezekiel did not remain a focus of my research, which implies that this paper cannot present genuinely new data or interpre- tations of the texts I shall address. Writing this paper did however give me the opportunity to look back at some of my earlier work from a distance, and to take stock of some criticism, alternative arguments, and further advances in the field. Advances in historical research depend in no small a measure on contingent matters which we don't really control - like war in Iraq, which probably pro- vided the background for relevant antiquities (in this instance, illegally exca- vated cuneiform tablets from the Nippur area mentioning Āl-Yāhūdu ["Judah- town", earlier: Āl-Yāhūdāya] and other places inhabited by Judahite exiles east and south-east of Nippur) to be smuggled out of the region before starting to profoundly affect present scholarship on the destiny of Judahites living in Babylonia during the Late Babylonian and Achaemenid periods.6 Our choice 2 Ch.

I have tried to write this paper in a way that would be open to discussion in either context, that is, beyond the discipline of Hebrew Bible studies. Consequently, I shall not be concerned with 'iconographie bibli- cal exegesis' in a narrow, discipline-focused sense9, but with aspects of ancient visuality , visual culture, visualizing strategies, scopic regimes etc. as displayed in selected texts from the book of Ezekiel. 10 When reading texts such as visionary reports (reporting something the prophet is said to have seen), accounts of so-called sign-acts (which, it is writ- ten, the prophets contemporaries would have seen) and many other texts which refer to objects the prophet and his contemporaries would have seen or at least imagined , the average reader is continuously urged to him- or her- self imagine what all these matters would have looked like and and how he or she, a modern reader, far removed in time, space, social background etc. from the texts early backgrounds and contexts should imagine them today. 11 If we are sensitive to such appeals to the visual and to imagination processes 12 9 See, e.g., I. de Hülster and R.

Whereas the object of inquiry seems to be a given in the former discipline, it generally needs to be conceptually construed and far more theoretically reflected in the latter.

The basic requirement for asking and researching such questions is familiar- ity with ancient visual cultures, that is, as much knowledge of primary evidence as possible. Needless to say, our attempts to reconstruct ancient visual cultures are fragmentary and hypothetical. But it seems a reasonable demand neverthe- less that biblical scholars, whose profession is to deal with the interpretation of texts, some of which are particularly imaginative, should care not only for how authors and transmitters visualized the world (or worlds) the texts imagine, but also how modern scholars themselves (and after all, other readers) visual- ize that world (or worlds) the texts make them imagine. The following paper may thus be read as an exercise in historically informed, iconography-based controlled imagination.

For practical rea- sons, I shall focus on the two literary units which I happen to have studied in more detail years ago (see n. 2-3) and which both have a particular relation to Ezekiels "Babylonian context": chapters 4-5 (the inaugural series of sign- acts) and chapter 1 (the inaugural vision). I shall investigate how the historical study of visuality and historical visual culture impacts on our understanding of these texts and of the relationship they entertain with the visual. Following the two case studies, we shall venture into a comparison of the different kinds of relationship the vision of ch. 1 and the sign-acts of chs. 4-5 entertain with the visual. The terms "virtual vision" and "actual show" used in the title of this article should be taken as a heuristic device to mark significant differences between two types of visualization. 18 See, e.g., S.

These titles alone make clear how much contemporary biblical studies could benefit from more sustained theoretical and conceptual groundwork, lest it remains constricted by emic categories and a normative order it should study rather than duplicate. The very distinctions of signifying vs. magical act, or of magic operation vs. prophetic word, betray the long-term effects of conceptual prejudice deeply rooted in the 'European' (or Christian 'Western') conceptual order, in which the con- cept of "magic" has been used to disqualify non-conformist religious (ritual, therapeutic, and scholarly) practices. See below, n. 27ff.</page><page sequence="7">68 Christoph Uehlinger Case study I: Ezek. 4-5 Let us start with what is arguably the most famous of Ezekiels shows, namely the inaugural series of sign-acts related in chs. 4-5. The two chapters display the following sequence: A. Non-verbal action (1) 4,1-2: model siege against an * unnamed city (2) 4,3. . .7: iron griddle, hard face and bared arm (3) 4, 4-6... 8: lying 390 days on the left, 40 days on the right side, with ropes (4) 4,9-11: rationed food 4,12-17 : ill-prepared, impure barley cakes (5) 5,1-2: shaving and dispensing the three parts of hair 5,3-4 : additional manipulation on part of the last third B. Verbal explanation (a) 5,5: "This is Jerusalem. (b) etc. Each unit of non-verbal action is introduced by an explicit address to the prophet: wo=atta "and you". The actions follow each other in a logical se- quence and gain in dramatic intensity: first, a siege is laid against a model city drawn on a brick (1); subsequent actions make clear that this siege is non- revokable (2) and that it will last over an extended period of time (3). As a result, food in the city will be scarce and rationed (4). Finally, the city will be taken and its inhabitants will die (5). Various commentators have provided good arguments that ch. 4 had a ra- ther complicated redaction history. This does not mean that the chapter can- not be understood without such an assumption (I would rather stress the con- trary), but a redaction-critical approach can best make sense of a number of ir- regularities such as sudden changes of focus, apparent internal contradictions in the account, attenuations (human excrements replaced by cow dung, spare portion of the third part of hair. . .), phraseological links which tie the account to other parts of the book, etc. As argued by many commentators, including some who are not generally inclined to literary analysis and redaction criti- cism, it seems very probable that the original account was somewhat shorter and presented a more straightforward progression from initial siege through starvation to conquest and annihilation of the cities inhabitants. Most im- portant in the present context, two namings of Jerusalem within ch. 4 should be understood, one as a scribal gloss (v. 1: ,et=yorūšālāim), the other as part</page><page sequence="8">Virtual Vision vs. Actual Show: Strategies of Visualization in the Book of Ezekiel 69 of a redactional amplification (v. 7: W9='el-m9sôr yorúsãlaim tāķīn pāneķā). Otherwise, it would indeed be difficult to understand why the verbal explana- tion of the performance should open in 5:5 with the divine statement: "This is Jerusalem..." ( koh ' amar 'ãdonây zo't yorůšalaim). In an article published in 1987 (see n. 2) I started from such observations in order to demonstrate some characteristic differences between visual and ver- bal communication: visual information is here encoded in a drawing of a city scratched onto a brick, a model siege and various typical actions that could easily be understood by contemporaries of the prophet and which appeal to stereotypical representations; language, in contrast, can attribute indexical in- formation and put a name even on the most stereotyped of images of a city.20 Against most commentators of the time, I argued that the scratch drawing on the brick did probably not represent a ground-plan but a vertical view of the city to be besieged, stylized according to the conventions of the time. Ground- plans of cities are attested in much earlier periods (early second millennium), but in the Neo-Babylonian period they are to my knowledge attested (or im- plied by texts) only for fields and individual buildings, not for cities. In this instance, then, the knowledge of historical visual culture allowed an educated guess about a detail which is simply not addressed in the narrative but which may be important insofar as, in contrast to a relatively technical ground-plan, the stylized vertical view of a city raises specific emotions: If the performance started with an isolated image of a city standing, this image would have had first of all a positive connotation and be understood as a symbol of strength and security - before being reverted into its opposite, fear. One of the most interesting aspects of the nonverbal actions in ch. 4 seems to be the contrast between their absolutely clear content (siege, starvation, an- nihilation ... after all, a sign or signifying performance is at issue here) and the large ambiguity of silence regarding the actual identity of the city and its inhabitants so represented. In a context of dispute among the exiled of the Jehoiachin (597) displacement, some would have regarded favourably the attempts of their Jerusalem relatives to resist the power of Nebuchadnezzar, while others may have held a more skeptical view. Until the very disclosure of the city s name, the siege enactment would not necessarily have pointed to one single political option. The prophets actions could well be viewed in different ways and even allow for the possibility that the city under siege might represent Babylon. Even the performer s own role long remained somewhat ambiguous insofar as it changed from setting the scene to preparing aggression, from non- intervention to sympathetic suffering and self-humiliation. Only with the ver- bal explanation would the referent of these actions become definitely clear. 20 Hence, the necessity felt by Assyrian craftsmen working on monumental palace reliefs to some- times identify a particular image of a city by adding its name in writing, in such cases where the correct identification of the city would have enhanced the understanding of its depiction.</page><page sequence="9">70 Christoph Uehlinger Kelvin G. Friebels doctoral dissertation published in 1999 studies "Jere- miahs and Ezekiel s sign-acts" as examples of "rhetorical non-verbal commu- nication".21 To the best of my knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and most important treatment of prophetic sign-acts and performances published over the last 40 years.22 I am lucky to report that as far as Ezek. 4-5 are con- cerned, Friebel seems to have accepted most of my 1987 suggestions, or come to the same conclusions independently: "In the representation of the model siege (4.1-2), there was no ambiguity as to what the nonverbal artifacts represented - they illustrated the siege of a city. But there was probably ambiguity over specifics of the representation, such as what city it was and who the attackers were. (...) Due to the schematized nature of the drawing, (...) the specific identification of the city may well have been very difficult to ascertain immediately. Because of the popular theology, the audience may have thought or hoped that Ezekiel was representing the siege of Babylon itself, and thus declaring a message like other prophets (cf. Jer. 27-29) who were proclaiming Babylon s imminent demise. (...) If the nonverbal displays by the prophet were thus erroneously misconstrued by the audience because of their being filtered through the popular theological beliefs, the impact of EzekieFs words 'This is Jerusalem' (5.5) must have been immensely shocking. It was a message the audience would not have anticipated hearing nor desired to hear. But their argumentative defenses would have been down, making the suasive impact more forceful."23 Like Bernhard Lang24 and others, Friebel regards the sign-act narratives as accounts on actual public performances, which served a "suasive" purpose, namely to convince the exiles of the Jehoiachin generation of the impend- ing disaster in Jerusalem. In the light of more recent studies by Dalit Rom- Shiloni25 and others, one might consider if Ezekiels public performances pre- 587 should be regarded not only as warnings against those among the exiles who sympathized with the Zedekiah party at Jerusalem, but as first steps in disconnecting the Jehoiachin exiles from their Jerusalem relatives and in con- structing a specifically exilic identity.

Another issue may be of interest when we address the "Babylonian back- ground" of the book of Ezekiel: the debate whether Ezekiels performances, or sign-acts, and specifically the ones related in chs. 4-5 have anything to do with the Mesopotamian tradition of so-called "sympathetic magic".26 Writing in 1987, 1 had an argument with well-known and influential Georg Fohrers study27 on what Fohrer had called the "symbolic actions" ( Symbolhandlungen ) of the prophets. Although according to Fohrer the symbolic actions of the prophets had much in common with actions known from Mesopotamian rit- ual series such as Šurpu or Maqlû 28, the German (and then, Protestant) scholar (and many others following him) would deny their 'magical' character be- cause of certain theological preconceptions: In line with dominating theo- logical thinking, he attributed the ultimate success of sign-acts neither to the prophet nor to the inherent power of prophetic communication, but to the di- vine will alone - thus assuming a tension that, to my own candid reading, is not so much inherent in the text but dialectically emphasized, and then resolved, by the exegete in the first place. This kind of argument seems unreceivable to me in a historically and theoretically informed close reading of the text. Friebel too, for whom the sign-acts are essentially acts of nonverbal commu- nication and whose epistemology is more sophisticated than Fohrer s, rejects any association or link with sympathetic magic. I would argue that whether or not a link between some Mesopotamian 'magical' tradition29 may be es- tablished or not will, on the one hand, entirely depend on the quality of par- allels that can be adduced; such parallels alone may help to evaluate whether Ezekiels actions are is better understood as an ad hoc or as a script-regulated 26 The concept of sympathetic magic goes back to James George Frazer s The Golden Bough. A Study in Magic and Religion , London: Macmillan, 1915ff (numerous reprints). While many of Frazer s views have long come under considerable fire, this concept continues to be widely used in humanities and social sciences.

On the other hand, and more importantly, we should be aware and acknowledge how much exegetical judgments on this issue are guided by theological prejudice and by the lack of adequate conceptual tools. Viewed from a distance, there is no need to make too strong a separation between acts of putative sympathetic magic (that is, ritually controlled and divinely induced actions which the performer is convinced to be in severe correspon- dence with divine will and thus of necessary consequence), and performances such as the siege sequence of Ezek. 4. While there is no hint in Ezek. 4 that the performance should be regarded as the causal movens of what would ac- tually happen to Jerusalem, it is quite obvious (and the verbal explanation of ch. 5 leaves no room for doubt) that the performance is meant to be in close correspondence to what would ultimately happen in Jerusalem. The basic as- sumption in both ritual and communicative performance is that the enactment represents a process unfolding in actual reality controlled by divine causality and ascertained by the performer. We should not exclude therefore that at least some of the prophets sign-acts (for instance, the shaving and manipula- tion of hair) should be understood in quite the same way as what scholars tend to call 'magic - all the more so since in this instance, "Ezekiel, a member of the Priestly family, was performing an action which as part of the priestly regula- tions was prohibited".30 Some of Ezekiel s sign-acts were severely transgressive with regard to social and ritual expectations towards a priest. They would have raised astonishment, perhaps even scandal, among contemporaries as much as they do so for any informed reader of the book. It would be interesting to inves- tigate further which and how many of these transgressions may have resulted from exposure of Ezekiel, a learned Judahite prophet and priest, to practices, procedures and background knowledge of Babylonian scribes, scholars, and possibly social activists. Let us turn now to another testimony of transgression - or acculturation, if you will: Ezekiels inaugural vision of ch. 1, which we shall study in its complex relationship to ch. 10. Case study II: Ezek. i31 The argument to be developed in this section can best be exposed in five theses: (1) Considered from a perspective of iconography, ancient visual culture and visuality, it appears quite clearly that the report on Ezekiels inaugural vi- 30 Friebel, op. cit.

(2) The earliest content of Ezekiel s inaugural vision can be recovered at least in its basic contours, which clearly place it in a Babylonian cultural envi- ronment. Some features of the vision, however, could not possibly have been imagined in Babylonia and must be explained otherwise. (3) Ezekiel s inaugural vision is not only a new and on first sight unusual de- scription of a deity y or of theophany, an aspect on which most commenta- tors put their strongest if not exclusive focus. It envisions the deity as the most eminent entity in a more complex system', which is itself consistent with Assyro-Babylonian (or Late Babylonian) cosmological conceptions more than with anything else we know from the Bible or the ancient Near East. As much as with theology, the earliest layer of Ezek. 1 is concerned with cosmology. (4) Such matters were of interest not so much to the average Judahite ex- ile, whose primary concern was to acculturate to Babylonian society in terms of a living, i.e. business, administration, and law - if anything, the newly-published documents from the Nippur area have confirmed this particular point.32 And it did probably not concern the average prophet or priest among the exiles. In Babylonian society, sophisticated cosmol- ogy mattered to advanced students and scholars only. It stands to rea- son that the author of the inaugural vision had considerable exposure to Babylonian cosmological scholarship, as retrievable to us in a variety of cuneiform sources and genres, including the so-called mystical and ex- Kabody and Cherub: Ontological and Epistemological Hierarchy in Ezekiel", in: id. and C.

The expanded Ma- soretic text itself, whose redactional growth I have tried to disentangle in a joint study with Susanne Müller Trufaut36, includes additions which try to be in line with the vision s original cosmological concern, while oth- ers seem more interested in imagining the fantastic world of intermediate beings and still others interfere in matters of mechanics to the result that later readers would look for a divine chariot, a rather traditional concept, as it were, but here perceived in a very particular way. 37 In short, I suggest that we consider Ezekiel s inaugural vision in its earliest form as a piece of scholarship as much as a testimony to the early and exceptional acculturation of a learned Judahite exile to the Babylonian academia.38 It is probably within learned circles as well that the author of Ezek. 1 would have been exposed, if ever, to actual iconography of the time related to what he expounded in the vision report.39 The complexity of ch. 1 has, on the one hand, always been acknowledged (compare the Toseftas laconic saying: "Many expounded the merkabâ and still, they, never saw it" [TMeg 3(4):28]), and it has, on the other hand, prompted numerous attempts to reduce the challenges of complexity of con- 33 A.

In addition, it can of course document the sometimes extraordinary career of a visually charged text in the visual arts, which may well be understood as particular responses to the text (as much as to other factors prevalent in their own particular context).</page><page sequence="14">Virtual Vision vs. Actual Show: Strategies of Visualization in the Book of Ezekiel 75 tent through diachronic literary analysis. Walter Zimmerlis approach has been the most influential especially in German-speaking scholarship40, but it did not produce consensual results because it relied on a quite heterogeneous set of criteria, some of them quite arbitrary. This is even more true for alter- native suggestions, for instance by Karl-Friedrich Pohlmann41, whose ober- vations are often acute but show no interest at all in ancient visual culture, visualization or imagination. Since it is easy not to be convinced by the lit- erary critics suggestions regarding Ezek. 1, it comes as no surprise that the chapter has remained a central piece in the architecture of so-called 'holistic' approaches, which claim literary unity for it in spite of all the textual evidence speaking against it. Interestingly enough, however, scholars who argue for the literary unity and for a single-handed authorship (for instance, Moshe Green- berg42 or Daniel I. Block43) regularly resort to explanations of the kind that since the object described is of mysterious nature, the alerted reader should not expect straightforward coherence or clear understanding of the details. I cannot but express my skepticism against such an interpretative stance, which in my view installs mysticism in the wrong place. When we modern scholars do not understand an ancient text, we should not put the blame on those who produced it; neither should we surround them with an aura of admiration or project on them modern or a-historical assumptions about the manner myste- rious realities would have been expressed in antiquity. Modern critics should be interested in the 'mysterious as a category for understanding and a key for disclosure only, rather than using that key to prevent critical analysis.44 The literary analysis and diachronical explanation of Ezek. 1 cannot operate without taking into account chs. 10 and 11, where in another vision report the 40 W.

Zimmerli s literary-critical analysis was flawed by two methodological limitations: He analyzed ch. 1 only for itself as a self-contained composition, and he assumed a one-way influence from ch. 1 to ch. 10 only but not vice versa. Once we analyze the parallel chap- ters synoptically, it becomes easier not only to establish an inventory of the commonalities and differences between the two visionary descriptions; it also becomes clear that there must have been some effect from ch. 10 on ch. 1 once the two chapters figured on the same scroll. On the assumption that the vi- sionary saw the same deity in a consistent cosmological environment, once in heaven and once moving from the temple, ancient scribes musing over these texts and copying them anew must necessarily have been inclined to add to their consistency.45 This is not the place to (re-)develop the details of a literary analysis and a model of diachronical growth based on the comparison of ch. 1 and 10. 46 Suf- fice it to recall the outlines of my understanding of the inaugural vision and its successive reworkings and amplifications as argued in the already-mentioned article published in 2001 with the assistance of Susanne Müller-Trufaut. Ac- cording to that analysis, the visionary nucleus, appearing to 'Ezekiel' from the midst of a dark mass of cloud and lightning, first consisted of four 'beings or creatures ( hayôt ) of human likeness with human face and arms, but straight legs and young bull s hooves as well as four wings each, "and they sparkled like burnished bronze" (v. 7). Above these creatures appeared the heavenly firmament ( raqîa?)y "shining like awe-inspiring crystal, spread out above their heads". Above this expanse appeared a lapis lazuli throne, on which was seated an anthropomorphic deity, whose precise contours were however difficult to ascertain to the visionary since they appeared again in an exceptionally bril- liant light of burning amber. The deity was enclosed by a shrine ( bayit , rather than just a "receptacle"), again of exceptionally glaring brightness.47 That this finds a remarkable parallel both in Exodus 24:9-10 and in the description of Bēl/Marduks abode in the Late Assyrian text KAR 307 11. 30-33 has often been noticed and was recalled at our seminar by Abraham Winitzer.48 I have noth- ing to add to his interpretation. My intent here is rather to make clear that 45 On the topic of divine presence, absence, and movement, see further J. F. Kutsko, Between Heaven and Earth .

This is the one "wheel" or "sphere" ( 'of an ' ehad , v. 15) appearing on the ground between the creatures (v. 15), a feature to which later expansions would add significant complexity. Such a feature occurs indeed in roughly contemporary iconog- raphy, though more often of early Achaemenid date, in the form of a wheel which sometimes seems to be stylized as a shining or brilliant entity (hence the rosette- or spokes-like representation).51 While this feature may appear together with other planetary and astral symbols in Neo-Assyrian glyptics, it also appears alone, and always so, on somewhat later seals. The latter con- sistently place this 'wheel' under the winged disk, which both represents the heavens and often one of its major inhabitants, whether the sun-god (the most visible to the human eye when appearing on the lower sky) or the major god of the middle sky above. Although these later images generally do not show the hooved sky-bearing genies anymore, such are known to have survived on other Achaemenid seals and sealings. In earlier glyptics, an anthropomorphic lunar deity may occasionally appear in a circle in the same position underneath the winged disk. In these instances it is not altogether clear whether we should understand the circle as just a halo or, like the wheel, as a feature indicating circular movement. The close and differential analysis of roughly contemporary iconography can thus give us at least a direction in which to search for a background and meaning for Ezekiels yofan 'ehad. However, it does of course not tell us the whole story. What is at stake in this concept of a wheel or sphere is, if you will, circularity y that is the regular movement of astral bodies visible to the hu- man eye on the lower heaven. This idea of circularity is further (maybe later?) developed in the text in the concept of four ' ôfanîm , a concept that goes be- yond what we know from contemporary iconography. In ch. 1, the ' ôfanîm 49 Note, however, that neither of which is designated with the appropriate Babylonian terms, but all four are grouped together as 'beings' or creatures' ( hayôt ). 50 I follow Keel's lead (n.4) with regard to the first proposition, adding to it a diachronic, redaction-historical dimension; instead of making a general claim, I depart from that lead with the second statement. 51 See Uehlinger and Miiller-Trufaut, art. cit. (n. 3), 168f figs. 5-12; also reproduced and aug- mented in a subsequent treatment of Ezek. 1 by O. Keel, mentioned below in n. 54.</page><page sequence="17">78 Christoph Uehlinger are related to the creatures and their movement; they appear alongside each creature, hence four wheels, which apparently are meant to have operated one inside each other (v. 16). The principle of circularity is thus brought to a higher level of complexity. In 10:13 (but not in ch. 1), this whole device will ultimately be identified with the galgai also mentioned in 10:2, 6, a feature interpreted by Pierre Grelot52 and others as once more some kind of circular halo. I would argue that the content matter of all this goes beyond what Othmar Keel, who highlights the theophanic aspects like almost all modern commen- tators, has called the "Herrlichkeitserscheinung des Königsgottes"53, which would essentially be a matter of theology. Rather than being concerned with the hierophany of a (the) deity alone, Ezekiel s inaugural vision provides an insight into a whole cosmological system. The supreme god is an essential part of that system which operates under his authority; but the system clearly op- erates according to mixed rules , combining technicality (the wheels), agency (the creatures) and a governing intentionality ( rûah ). Such a system implies a blending of mythology (as condensed in the figures of the hayôt and the concept of a supreme deity enthroned in a heavenly shrine) with elementary technical knowledge about planetary movements. Such a blendover based on canonical mythology, centuries of astronomical observation and the synthe- sis of both in compendia and learned commentaries is well attested from As- syrian and Babylonian scholarly literature. For the advanced Late-Babylonian scholar, canonical mythology and astronomy represented and provided dif- ferent levels of understanding of the same reality. The connection between the two was developed in the learned commentaries and so-called 'mystical and explanatory' works. Cuneiform scholarship had long developed over cen- turies as a multi-layered knowledge system within an epistemic culture that favoured cumulative knowledge and a "multiplicity of approaches" to reality. How much of this epistemic culture and knowledge system would be acces- sible to Ezekiel, the exiled Judahite expert turned scholar-student, in a basi- cally foreign environment he had to cope with and adapt to at least to some extent? We do not know for sure and lack well-grounded information about the availability and accessibility of Babylonian scholarship to a Judahite out- sider - surrounded as some of the more advanced scholarship may have been by rules of secrecy (that is an etiquette controlling access to sensitive material). We should not speculate too much in the absence of conclusive evidence, but I would postulate that the author of Ezek. 1 (in its initial version) had consid- erable exposure to Babylonian cosmological scholarship; that he clearly shows 52 P.

More than that: If we take seriously the place of this vision at the head of all that follows, both in the book and according to the books chronology, the enhancement of traditional theophanic motives with considerably more sophisticated Babylonian cosmo- logical knowledge seems to have provided to the prophet-priest the epistemic foundation for a new perspective on the supreme god s dominion, a god whom the Babylonian scholars called Marduk or Bèi but whom Ezekiel himself and his followers would recognize as Yahweh. The more I muse about this vision, the less I am surprised that the book of Ezekiel, unlike the books of Jeremiah or Isaiah, is devoid of polemics against Babylon and her gods or cults.55 To be sure, my account up to here rests on a hypothetical reconstruction of an early stage of the inaugural vision. This is not the place to tell in detail the further development and interrelated expansions of Ezekiel chs. 1 and 10. In- terestingly enough, the physical appearance of the hayôt and the coordination of their movements seem to have generated further reflection and extrapola- tion much more than the appearance of the deity himself and of His heavenly abode. Let me sketch the most conspicuous developments. In line with a more western iconographical tradition, attested for instance, in the tenth-century temple of Äin Dārā56, the four hayôt were physically in- dividualized by attributing them different faces, whether of a bull, a lion, a vul- ture or a human. The faces themselves were then multiplied to four each, which added vision on all sides to those beings. Other developments were necessary once the inaugural vision was brought together with the visionary materials of chaps. 8-11. Ch. 10-11 tells how the divine kàbôd left the Jerusalem temple before the city came to be besieged again. In an early stage of these chapters, the kãbôd was related to the korûbîm. Once brought into the same literary 54 A. Winitzer concluded on entirely different grounds (from Ezek. 4:4-8, Ezek. 28 and the Epic of Gilgamesh) to "an awareness of learned sides of the host environment. These, moreover, are impressive for their range: in terms of subject, contextual setting, size, technicality, and (alleged) date and location in the prophetic book, Ezekiel reveals an impressive knowledge of the Babylonian learned landscape. (...) the possibility that this early Jewish prophet reached the Babylonian schools and drank from the very source of Babylon s stream of literary tradition cannot be denied" (art. cit. [n. 39], 205f.). 55 Further differences have been recently discussed in K. M. Rochester, Prophetic Ministry in Jeremiah and Ezekiel (Contributions to Biblical Exegesis and Theology, 65; Leuven: Peeters, 2012). 56 A.

The hayôt were thus straightforwardly identified with the korûbîm , the ' ôfanîm with the galgai, etc., inducing an ongoing process of harmonization during quite some time guided by the need of scroll-internal consistency. That scribes working and reworking ominous literature should attempt to accommodate what they must have perceived as variant descrip- tions of one single divine reality comes as no surprise. As mentioned, one major effect of this coordination process was the iden- tification of the hayôt in ch. 1 with the ksrûbîm of ch. 8-11. In the context of our investigation on visuality, we should remark that such an identifica- tion would have made no sense to a Babylonian expert, whether craftsman or scholar, since the human-bovine kusarikkû and the more leonine korûbîm are really not of the same kind nor did they ever have the same functions in Mesopotamian mythological thought. That Judahite scribes could identify the two (and ultimately produce literary creatures which had no clear correspon- dence in contemporary iconography anymore) implies that their concern and task was not affected by actual visual culture and imagination, but related to the scroll and to ongoing debates about the latter s ominous meaning. To be sure, the iconographical repertoire of subsequent periods can provide occa- sional insights in the continuous process of hybrid formation. For instance, that the bodies of the korûbîm were covered with eyes may perhaps be re- lated to late-period Egyptian images of winged Bes, and sometimes Bes Pan- theos covered with eyes to demonstrate universal ocular control.57 For our present concern, however, what matters most is to recognize that such images were unknown in Babylonia and would for sure have been misunderstood as monstrous creatures in a Babylonian context. The same holds true for another feature, namely that each of the kdrûbîm (and by consequence, of the hayôt) should have had four different faces. Both developments must have occurred at a time (roughly the fourth century BCE) when the Ezekiel scroll was in the hands of scribes operating in Palestine, that is close to Egypt and the southern Levant, and not in Babylonia. Incidentally, the scribes' increasingly scroll-internal and ultimately 'inner- biblical' concerns would also lead to a progressive disconnection of our chap- ter from actual cosmological discourses, as they continued to be developed among Babylonian and Levantine scholars, and a growing tendency toward literary fiction. Step by step, the process produced a representation of Ezekiels inaugural vision that had more to do with the 'fantastic' (we might say, ana- chronistically, with science fiction) rather than with ancient cosmological sci- ence. An interesting feature of that kind are the eyes covering the ksrûbîrns bodies which in the final text of ch. 1 are said to cover the wheels (or spheres). 57 Note Keel's assent in Die Geschichte Jerusalems (n. 4), 698f.; id., "Die Herrlichkeitserscheinung" (n. 54), 146.</page><page sequence="20">Virtual Vision vs. Actual Show: Strategies of Visualization in the Book of Ezekiel 81 I do not pretend that this feature would not make sense at all, since the eyes on the spheres could easily be identified as stars. But this very idea is probably a secondary rationalization of a difficult textual feature; more important for our present concern, it has no relation whatsoever with iconography or visual culture. As we know, the ultimate result was merkãbâ , a term not attested in Ezek. 1 but consistently read into that chapter since the Hellenistic period (IChr. 28:18, Sir. 49:8, mHag 2:1 etc.) until this day.58 The very concept of merkãbâ (which of course draws on the archaic concept of travelling deities, especially storm-gods) provides emblematic proof that with the scrolls transfer from Babylonia to Palestine, and its removal from a sophisticated scholarly envi- ronment to a more parochial scribal community, mythological imagination would take the lead over once cosmologically interested knowledge, and this to the detriment of science. Commentators over centuries have been labour- ing to no avail to make sense, in terms of properly working mechanics, of the complicated movements of the hayôt , kQrûbîm and ' ofanîm according to the Masoretic text of Ezek. 1 and 10. In my view, the ultimate source of the prob- lem is the co-existence in these texts of two hardly reconcilable concerns for movement: cosmology requires models of spheres and circular movement; the displacement of kãbôd from the temple mount to the Mount of Olives and be- yond, however, is a linear movement. The two cannot be reconciled in terms of engineering, if only by the mystic. Far from showing the ultimate coherence championed by readers of the 'holistic confession, Ezek. 1 looks to me like a composite text which testifies to an intense and fascinating struggle for meaning by several generations of scribes. The original key of the ominous visionary message seems to have been lost at some time, probably when the scroll was disconnected from its origi- nally Babylonian background. One consequence in the later Jewish tradition would be the development of a cosmology in a new key' of sorts, that is, an 'esoteric' cosmology interpreting the cosmos according to putative revelation and mythology alone rather than in accordance with empirical observation. This far-reaching issue cannot be pursued further here. Visualizing strategies in the book of Ezekiel Let us come back to what I announced as the primary topic of this paper, the interest in ancient visuality and visual culture in their relationship to the one book in the Hebrew Bible which is most conspicuously concerned with im- 58 D.

To sum up squarely, we have observed both in sign-acts and in visionary texts some significant features which can only be understood with reference to the visual culture of a Babylonian background; others which can best be explained through visual culture, but not of Babylonia; still others which cannot be understood from visual culture at all, whether Babylonian or otherwise. We have seen that the sign-acts and the inaugural vision draw on very dif- ferent types of visual knowledge: The former operate with easily identifiable stereotypes, whereas the latter mobilizes much more elite knowledge. That knowledge seems to have been acquired through formal education and/or in- teraction with Babylonian scholars, but also apparently through the medium of cylinder seals. It may be significant to point out that the latter were at that time slowly running out of fashion, being more and more supplanted by co- noid stamp seals that could serve for sealing both clay tablets and bullae. Cylin- der seals continued to be produced but for a minority of traditionalists or high- level officials only. They seem to have had greater prestige though, and were considered so precious belongings that they would sometimes be transmitted as family heritage over several generations. Persian-period tablets from the Persepolis Fortification archives include sealings which were apparently made from Neo- Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian cylinder seals.59 Although Ezekiels sign-acts are known to us only through carefully crafted literary accounts, they seem to operate in the mode of actual performances ad- dressing a public audience. I am not quite sure whether the term "street the- ater" used by Bernard Lang is an appropriate label, since at least some of the sign-acts seem to go beyond pure show and operate with the seriousness of an incantatory performance. But they do seem to have been actual shows staged in public space. Moreover, in contrast to one Hananyahs or Jeremiahs perfor- mances, those described in the book of Ezekiel carry a certain ambiguity and reflectiveness which would well befit an 'intellectual', as David Vanderhooft put it during our seminar (although the concept may still be slightly anachro- nistic in the context of sixth-century Babylonia). Street theater is meant to raise attention in public, and the performance suc- ceeds if it captures its public. It is probably not by accident that Ezekiels sign- acts are presented more than once as openly transgressive operations. In con- trast, visions and vision reports function along quite different lines and codes of communication. Visionaries claim to have been granted special knowledge; their authority, the authority of the claim and of the visionary himself rest on the recognition of the medium by their audience or readership. Such recog- nition may be a matter of already well-established, non-transgressive prestige 59 See M. B. Garrison and Margaret Cool Root, Seals on the Persepolis Fortification Tablets. Vol. 1: Images of Heroic Encounter (Oriental Institute Publications, 117; Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 2001).</page><page sequence="22">Virtual Vision vs. Actual Show: Strategies of Visualization in the Book of Ezekiel 83 and social capital, or depend from the attractiveness, plausibility and cultural capital of the visionary content. I have argued that the inaugural vision of Ezek. 1 seems to draw considerable knowledge from Babylonian scholarship and elite visual culture. It comes with the full weight of higher education and cul- tural capital, something that may have more impressed the elders gathering in Ezekiel s house rather than the commoners in the street among the Judahite exiles. Sign-acts and visions (or rather, reports on visions) may be considered as two different genres operating on two different levels of communication be- tween a god and his Judahite subjects, a process controlled by the prophet- priest acting as the intermediary. While the vision is certainly meant to le- gitimate the medium, it still needs to be recognized by the latter s audience. The same holds true for the sign-acts. Martti Nissinen has rightly stressed at our seminar that we don't know much about Ezekiel s audience and that we cannot compensate this lack by just bringing into the picture other Judahites as we happen to know them from the Āl-Yāhūdu or the later Murāšū tablets. As it happens, the Āl-Yāhūdu, Murāšū and other lots of tablets are interested neither in cosmology nor in politics; the Āl-Yāhūdu tablets do not carry any iconography, nor the Murāšū tablets any motif of the specific iconography Ezekiels inaugural vision draws upon. This difference of concern certainly represents significant evidence to be pondered by the critical historian. But the sign-act accounts and the vision reports both have an implied audi- ence, in addition to audiences explicitly mentioned in chs. 12 and 24. The im- plied audience they require would presume considerable cultural knowledge and reflexivity, including visual competence. That we would not be able to read these texts were they not products of an actual history might be a common- place observation. But it raises the challenge for future studies to investigate whether the implied audience of the texts and the actual Judahites known from Babylonian cuneiform documents were people who inhabited and shared the same real world. King Jehoiachin himself provides an important link between documentary history and the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel s loyal attachment to the young exiled king of Judah, whose family is known to have been economically supported in exile by the Babylonian administration60, may well have been at the roots of the prophet-priests active and positive engagement with Baby- lonian high culture and learning, including his involvement with visual and scholarly culture, and with Babylonian political interests contradicted by the more domestic political options of Zedekiah. As Dalit Rom-Shiloni has con- vincingly argued, Ezekiel constructed' a peculiar new 'identity' to the mem- 60 See, e.g., M. Gerhards, "Die Begnadigung Jojachins - Überlegungen zu 2.
