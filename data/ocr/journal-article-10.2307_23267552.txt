<plain_text><page sequence="1">iv • OETELAAR James Roderick Vickers 1946-2011 Rod Vickers died in hospital in Edmonton, Alberta on Novem ber 30, 2011. A lifetime bachelor, he is survived by his brother Ted of Campbell River. Rod was born in Regina, and grew up in Inuvik, where he completed high school in 1965. He then attended McMaster University in Hamilton, where he completed his BA in Anthropology in 1968. He flourished in the archaeology department at the University of Calgary, where he completed his Master's degree in 197S. He cherished his time there, making many lifetime friends, and spoke most highly of what he learned from Richard Forbis, Jane and Dave Kelley, Barney Reeves, Charlie Eyman and the other professors of that department. Most particularly, he admired Forbis' articulate, gentle, but no-nonsense style. Rod emulated Dick's example in his pro fessional life, being polite yet firm even in situations of strong disagreement. Such situations arose fairly frequently in the course of Rod's career as Plains archaeologist with the Archaeologi cal Survey of Alberta from 1980 to his retirement in 2006. Rod oversaw the busiest area of the province when it came to archaeological resource man agement. For a considerable period of time, this was the busiest area in the country because of its accelerated eco nomic development. There were only a rew years when oil and gas, residential, transportation, reservoir and other major developments were not proceed ing at a rapid pace in southern Alberta. Rod participated in managing all of these projects, directing the activities of consulting archaeologists and dealing effectively with project proponents and government officials. Rod took his public service role seriously. Within the letter of the law, he viewed himself as the front line in seeing to the proper assessment and mitigation of impacts to the province s irreplaceable archaeological heritage. Rod's advice to consulting archaeologists was often fundamental to the success of many of the studies he oversaw. Back in the days when an in-box was a tray on your desk, the top of Rod's shiny head could sometimes be barely seen above the mound of proposals and reports that he had to review. In 1990 the Archaeo logical Survey moved to the (then) Pro vincial Museum of Alberta, where Rod loved being instrumental in the devel opment of the Gallery of Aboriginal Culture. Later years saw the Survey move back to Old St. Stephen's College on the University of Alberta campus, where he felt most at home. Rod was always careful and deliberate, came in on time, took his coffee breaks at 10 and 3, and went home at 4:30, at which time he might have a scotch, a smoke, and read some history. Rod didn't always agree with industry, consultants, or his managers, but he accepted his role, didn't take his work home with him and always found ways to make a valuable contribution. Rod s duties at the Survey allowed for both research and publication. He loved research, and his numerous professional publications attest to that. His greatest individual contribution was the "Plains Blue Book", a summary of Alberta Plains archaeology, probably the most cited volume in Canadian, if not northern Plains prehistory (Vickers 1986). His later paper (Vickers 1991) on the sea sonal round on the Plains extended his culture history contributions to a well Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="2">EDITOR'S NOTES • v reasoned perspective on a basic problem of human ecology for that part of the world. During his career, he worked at a variety of precontact and historic period sites, including Ross, Fletcher, Lan caster, FM Ranch, Fort Victoria, and the Chilkoot Trail. While at the University of Calgary he assisted Charlie Eyman in Fiji, as director of the Nadrau Archaeol ogy Project in 1979 and 1980. In 1982 he travelled to Peru with Ronald Wright, one of the highlights of his personal and professional life, equaling his experi enees in Fiji, where he had also traveled with Wright. Rod figures as the semi fictitious character "Derek" in Wright's book "On Fiji Islands" (Wright 1986). Rod was a character. Many can remember him strutting to work, heels hard on the pavement, in a three-piece suit, trench coat, and fedora, and in the summer sputtering by in his Triumph TR7. He was a killer backgammon player and often said that his gaming ruthless ness was learned in poker sessions with his father. In his spare time, he loved cer tain strategy games, in particular Squad Leader, a complex war board game. With the advent of personal computers, Rod quickly embraced early side-scrolling games that required dexterity, timing, and tactical considerations. He was the last person one would have thought at the time would become enamoured with computers, but in 1987 he bought a Mac Plus and a new world opened up. Not only did he use it for gaming and writing, he also taught himself Pascal, Basic, and C programming, and hoped to one day develop his own game. In 1990 he devel oped an innovative HyperCard stack on the topic of medicine wheels, based on John Brumley's (1988) comprehensive data. Using a primitive scanning device known as ThunderScan attached to the print head of an ImageWriter dot-matrix printer, Rod scanned medicine wheel drawings and 1:50,000 maps, wrote descriptive text, then programmed an interactive graphic database intended for resource management and educa tional purposes. It remains a fantastic piece of work, but technology evolved so quickly that plans to take it further and develop similar tools simply could not be fulfilled. A voluminous reader (he often read one or two novels over the course of a weekend), he held a special interest in classical archaeology and military, especially naval, history. Conversations with Rod would cover everything from heads-up displays and armament systems in the latest fighter jets to specific tactics of British ships of the line in the 17th cen tury. Over the past couple of years Rod required dialysis three times a week and found his mind turning to new interests, one of which, surprisingly, was writing poetry. An example of this work appears here as his final publication. Rod is dearly missed but he won t be forgotten, nor does his devotion to archaeology end with his passing. Rod has left his estate to the University of Cal gary, where the Department of Archaeol ogy will administer The J. Rod Vickers Plains Research Endowment Fund, to support Plains archaeology graduate students. References Cited Brumley,John H. 1988 Medicine Wheels on the Northern Plains: A Summary and Appraisal.
