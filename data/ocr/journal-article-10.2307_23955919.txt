<plain_text><page sequence="1">What Is Speculative Thinking? Simon Jarvis 'How do you know? That's what I always want to ask when I read some grand claim of Adorno's, like "the history of civilization is the introversion of sacrifice" or whatever.'1 Of course, I was ready with answers to my friend's objection. But I soon felt that they might be of incompatible kinds. I wanted to say that unlike some grand thinkers, Adorno always took the question of empirical evidence extremely seriously; that he thought of criti cal theory as demanding more, rather than less, attention to experience than classical empiricism; that the habitual absence from his work of any extensive penumbra of bibliographical footnotes did not imply a cavalier approach to evidence, but only an alertness to the risk of privileging bulk of information over precision of reflection. Yet I also wanted to say that there were certain topics concerning which fear of error might be the error itself; that generalized scepticism towards all non-trivial claims about the history of civilization might serve the cause, not of a finer discrimination, but the still emptier generalization that no generalizations can be made; and that part of the point of that kind of generalized scepticism might be to prevent events of any significance from being considered to have taken place at all, or even to prevent them from taking place in the future. Fi nally, I wanted to explain to my friend that he was reading too literally; that many of Adorno's sharpest claims were not descriptive attempts to formu late propositions adequate to states-of-affairs, but attempts to provoke read ers into just that critical independence of mind my friend had himself dis played; that just as the truth of a sentence would depend on the order of its words as well as on which words it contained, so the truth of an argument would depend on the order of its sentences, of a book on the order of its chapters, and so on: so that each such large claim would need to be read not in isolation but as part of a philosophical composition. 1. This is my effort to recollect exactly what Neil Hertz said to me one day early in 2001.</page><page sequence="2">70 SIMON JARVIS Where many reasons are given, none is likely to persuade. I later found it hard to get rid of this little question, 'How do you know?' I came to wonder whether there was not something essentially speculative, not only about this or that passage of Adorno's writing, but about his life's work - 'speculative', that is, not only in the sense that his philosophical writing might depend on some kind of account of a difference between, say, specu lative propositions and abstractly identificatory judgements, but also in the less dignified sense that it might be giving voice not to knowledge, but to "speculation": to beliefs, surmises, wishes, hopes, imaginings. What kind of a philosopher would do this? Fully to answer this question, and that in my title, would demand a more extensive treatment; this one attempts rather to show some of the contours of the question. 1. That feature of Adorno's writing to which my friend objected, its tendency to vehement and global judgement, was by one critic interpreted as essen tially related to what she regarded as a fundamental weakness in his think ing. "Adorno does not use the dialectic, but he does judge it; he cannot 'give himself up to it' - for then his thinking would become speculative. For reasons he gives himself, he is 'under the spell', which accounts for the remorselessly judgemental tone and style of his writing."2 Vehemence fig ures here as the tone of an unhappy consciousness, hoping to keep its self intact through judgement. Rose understands this as one element in a wider failure to move from merely dialectical to fully speculative thinking. When considering, in a letter to Niethammer, how schoolchildren might be intro duced to philosophy, Hegel set out a map of three 'stages', in which 'abstract' thinking is succeeded by 'dialectical' thinking and finally by 'speculative' thinking. Adorno is taken as as a thinker who stops short at stage two, thinking dialectically but not speculatively.3 Hegel's own understanding of the relation between "speculation" and "dialectic", of course, is by no means uniform. Elsewhere he speaks of speculative thought not as a successor to but as an aspect or 'side' [Seite] of dialectic.4 This way of talking about it comes in the context of a considéra 2.

Kant is praised for having understood dialectic as "a necessary function of reason": the general idea on which he based his expositions and which he vindi cated, is the objectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the contra diction which belongs to the nature of thought determinations: prima rily, it is true, with the significance that these determinations are applied by reason to things in themselves; but their nature is precisely what they are in reason and with reference to what is intrinsic or in itself. This result, grasped in its positive aspect, is nothing else but the inner negativity of the determinations as their self-moving soul, the principle of all natural and spiritual life. But if no advance is made beyond the abstract negative aspect of dialectic, the result is only the familiar one that reason is incapable of knowing the infinite; a strange result for - since the infinite is the rational - it asserts that reason is incapable of knowing the rational. It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of opposites in their unity or of the positive in the negative, that specula tive thought consists. It is the most important aspect of dialectic, but for thinking which is as yet unpractised and unfree it is the most difficult.5 The difference from the letter to Niethammer on dialectic for schools might not seem important. The distinction made there between dialectical thinking and speculative thinking is effectively the same as that made here between negatively dialectical thinking and speculatively dialectical think ing. Yet if, in the Logic's less abstract way of putting it, speculative think ing is an 'aspect' of dialectical thinking, it might be harder to use Hegel's idea of speculation to identify Adorno's "negative dialectic" with a think ing stopping at stage two, failing to count to three. This is all the more likely because Adorno in fact appeals on several occasions to the idea of speculative thinking as an important element even of his "negative" dia lectic; and because Adorno understands what he means by "speculation", "speculative" and their cognates not only in relation to Hegel, but also with the whole range of their history and current import in view. One of Adorno's few attempts to define what he means by "speculative" thinking - which we shall read in more detail later — mentions not only Hegel but Hölderlin's prose of around 1800 and also Schopenhauer.6 In others of Adorno's uses of the word, Kant is the critical figure.7 The long quotation from Hegel given above intends to displace both the description and the evaluation of the speculative given by Kant.

"A theoretical cognition is speculative if it pertains to an object or concepts of an object to which one cannot attain in any experience. It is opposed to the cognition of nature, which pertains to no objects, or their predicates, except those that can be given in a possible experience."8 The role of specu lative reason is thus carefully circumscribed. Where speculative reason attempts direct cognition of objects to which one cannot attain in any expe rience, it is in need of a restraint which Kant is capable of comparing to that which the police exercise upon violence.9 Anticipating in this a long current of pejorative applications of the word, Kant also follows a long (and especially a nominalist and then Protestant) tradition of reproof to "mere" speculation.10 Yet if Kant finds speculative reason legitimate only in a very restricted sense, that sense turns out to be an important one. Specu lative reason "has at least made room for such an extension [of our cogni tion of the supersensible], even if it had to leave it empty; and we remain at liberty, indeed we are called upon by reason to fill it if we can with practi cal data of reason."11 Speculative reason, as it were, keeps the seat warm for practical reason. This way of putting it shares something of the sleight of hand which often attaches to Kant's accounts of the relation between theoretical and practical reason. Its counterpart comes in the Critique of Practical Reason when Kant claims that practical reason of itself, without any collusion with speculative reason, furnishes reality to a supersensible object of the category of causality, namely to freedom (although, as a practical concept, only for practical use), and hence establishes by means of a fact what could there only be thought. By this, the strange though incontestable asser tion of the speculative Critique, that even the thinking subject is in inner intuition a mere appearance to itself, gets its full confirmation in the Critique of Practical Reason, and that so thoroughly that one would have to arrive at it even if the former had never proved this proposition at all.12 8.

Inner intuition - at once thinking and feeling — is disassembled into an "appear ance to itself'.13 This is necessary so that the distinction between thinking and knowing may be kept clean. Thinking may not have ontological con tent, and it may not know any. Hegel's defence and expansion of speculative thinking, however, is more Kantian than might at first appear. Hegel was ready enough to find Kant's notion of thinking "empty", of course; and, of course, to criticize the sepa ration between 'thinking' and 'knowing'. But in another way that empti ness is itself taken up into Hegel's own conception of subjectivity. As a number of recent readings of Hegel have approvingly emphasized, what ever might be decided with respect to Hegel's thinking as a whole, his concept of subjectivity, at least, is in no way more metaphysical than Kant's. The subject is nothing at all by itself. Indeed, by itself, it is negativity itself; which, of course, is just to say that it never is perfectly "by itself'. The importance of this idea about the subject to Hegel's idea of speculative thinking is visible in the long quotation given above, with its extraordinary paratactic identification of "the inner negativity of the determinations as their self-moving soul" with "the principle of all natural and spiritual life".14 The difference from Kant is not that Hegel allows to the subject a sub stance which Kant refuses it, but that for Hegel substance is to become subject. Instead, therefore, of offering a series of reasons for laying our hands directly on what Kant renounced - immediate access to metaphysical cog nition - Hegel is building on an insight of Kant's which he thinks has not been taken far enough. What distinguishes Kant's treatment of dialectic from its predecessors is that it treats illusion and error not as something merely accidental, but instead, in Hegel's slightly loaded language, "ob jective". The errors of which transcendental dialectic is to treat are not lapses of reason so much as part of what reason is like. At this point Kant engages in an act of self-splitting. Good reason, eternally, brings bad reason to heel.15 For Hegel, conversely, thinking is always experience. 13. Cf.

Ideas are not like spaces which can either be "filled" should they correspond to some object of experience or "left empty" should they fail to do so. Yet this also shows up how far Hegel's absolute idealism is marked by its genuinely critical, rather than a merely dogmatic or sceptical, character. For the consequence is amphibious. To an atheist encountering the texts' freedom with the word "God", the result can seem to be the restoration of metaphysics. To a Chris tian with "faith", it can seem to be a more thoroughgoing demolition of God's "existence" - in any sense whose meaning can at all be experienced - than Kant's. It is as though the antinomies of pure reason had migrated, from their carefully delimited place in a prolegomenon to metaphysics, to become the very element of a whole life's work. Speculative identifica tion, as the organ or element of this absolute idealism, distributes this amphibious character through the whole authorship, where it performs a series of crises and resolutions. It turns out, then, unsurprisingly, that what "speculative thinking" means for Kant and for Hegel is in each case closely tied to what "thinking" in each case means for them. It is deeply significant that Kant, noticing the delightful yet supposedly quite unforced harmony between the empty space which speculative reason leaves open for freedom and the reality supplied to freedom by practical reason, chooses to comment in particular on the way in which this confirms the essential emptiness of inner experience, "that even the thinking subject is in inner intuition a mere appearance to itself." Kant needs this to be the case because it is essential that thinking not be contaminated by objectivity: One should not be brought up short by the fact that I have an inner experience of this proposition, which expresses the perception of one self, and hence that the rational doctrine of the soul that is built on it is never pure but is grounded in part on an empirical principle. For this inner perception is nothing beyond the mere apperception I think, which even makes all transcendental concepts possible, which say "I think substance, cause, etc."...The least object of perception (e.g., pleasure or displeasure) which might be added to the general representation of self consciousness, would at once transform rational psychology into an empirical psychology.16 At first sight Hegel might seem to mean precisely the opposite by 'think ing': 16.

Paul Guyer and Allen W. wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 412-13.</page><page sequence="7">WHAT IS SPECULATIVE THINKING? 75 Thinking is the third and last main stage in the development of intelli gence; for in it, the immediate, implicit unity of subjectivity and objec tivity present in intuition is restored out of the opposition of these two sides in representation as a unity enriched by this opposition, hence as a unity both in essence and in actuality. ... Those who have no compre hension of philosophy become speechless, it is true, when they hear the proposition that Thought is Being. None the less, underlying all our actions is the presupposition of the unity of Thought and Being.17 For Kant, thinking is and must be empty of being; for Hegel, it is and must be full of it. Yet this difference about 'thinking' rests on an accord about subjectivity. The fullness which Hegel's 'thinking' has is by no means its own property. It is not something it has by virtue of an inner intuition. Subjectivity "as such" is "our entirely empty self, the self without any fur ther content".18 On the contrary, its fullness comes only on condition of an absolute relinquishment of the illusion that there are any properties which belong to thinking, of its plunging into externality. That thinking is to be everything requires that it not have any ontological content of its own. Even though thought is being, Hegel can thus still agree with Kant that "inner perception is nothing beyond the mere apperception I think." Or rather, inner perception only is so long as it is "at the same time" wholly external: "We only know our thoughts, only have definite, actual thoughts, when we give them the form of objectivity, of a being distinct from our inwardness, and therefore the shape of externality, and of an externality, too, that at the same time bears the stamp of the highest inwardness."19 Essentially linked to this is the decision that all the content of affectivity must come from outside: "[t]he content of sensation is thus limited and transient, belonging as it does to natural, immediate being, to what is the refore qualitative and finite."20 Does Adorno's understanding of 'specula tive thinking', we should now ask, share this idea of what 'thinking' is? 17.

What Kant thought of as the centrally necessary function of the first cri tique, its curb on the overreachings of speculative reason, was by Adorno, in a section of Negative Dialectics decisive for our understanding of what he means by 'speculative thinking', interpreted as Kant's "block". It is argued, in anthropologizing fashion, that human consciousness is as it were condemned to an eternal split in the forms of knowledge which happen to have been given to it; that that which affects those forms escapes all determination, that it only receives determinacy from the forms of consciousness. But the forms are not that Ultimate which Kant described them as. Thanks to the reciprocity between them and the existing content they themselves also develop. This thought is incompatible with the conception of the indestructible block. If the forms are moments of a dynamic, as would in truth already be appropriate to the conception of the subject as original apperception, it is just as im possible to stipulate their positive form for all future cognition as it is so to stipulate any of the contents of cognition - contents without which the forms do not exist, and with which the forms change. Only if the dichotomy of form and content were absolute would Kant be permitted to assert that the dichotomy prohibits any content which comes from the forms, rather than a material content. If this material moment itself appropriates the forms, the block is shown to be created by the very subject which it shuts in. Whenever the limit is transferred into the sub ject, into its transcendental-logical organization, the subject is both elevated and degraded. The naïve consciousness to which even Goethe inclined: we do not yet know, but perhaps the riddle will none the less one day be solved, is closer to metaphysical truth than Kant's ignora mus. His anti-idealist doctrine of the absolute restriction, and the ideal ist doctrine of absolute knowing, are not so mutually inimical as both sides intended them to be; even the latter ends up, according to the path of thought in Hegel's Phenomenology, in the claim that absolute know ing is nothing but the path of thought of the Phenomenology itself, that is, that it is in no way transcendent.21 This paragraph is quoted in full because it contains in nuce Adorno's idea of idealism itself. A context of immanence legislated in Kant's work - the prohibition on metaphysical experience, or the idea that metaphysical "experience" is a contradiction in terms - becomes at best, a context of immanence-transcendence in Hegel's. This is the sense in which Kant's prohibition on reason's access to the absolute, and Hegel's insistence on it, are understood as twinned rather than fundamentally inimical. Yet it is not 21. Negative Dialektik, pp. 378-79.</page><page sequence="9">WHAT IS SPECULATIVE THINKING? 77 just transcendence, but also immanence, that becomes null here. The sub ject may not overreach itself, to knowledge of any transcendent object; yet at the same time, it is to have no content of its own at all. The ontology in which "nothing plus nothing equals something" is not contested, but gen eralized, in Hegel's thinking. In this sense "the subject is both elevated and degraded" not only in Kant but also in Hegel. Central to Adorno's under standing of idealism is that it is not only the empire of the subject, but also the evacuation of the subject, and that the latter is the price of the former. Negative dialectic, then, is not trying to bring the subject together with the object. It is not trying to separate the subject from the object. It is trying instead to reformulate that ontology itself. Against the evacuation of the subject, against the phenomenalization of the object, Adorno thinks a sub ject which is already somatic, an object which might have a meaning. Speculative thinking concerns the "turn against itself' which dialectic is obliged to take in order to think in this manner.22 Thus Adorno himself by no means thinks of speculative thinking as something which his book sets aside. Indeed he devotes a substantial early section of Negative Dialectics to "the speculative moment". Given Adorno's criticism in the section "Cri tique of positive negation" and elsewhere of the way in which Hegel for mulates the identity of identity and non-identity, what he means by the "speculative moment" cannot, if it refer to any particular aspect of Hegel's thought, refer to this aspect, but must be something else. The power of prevailing conditions puts up the façades into which consciousness crashes. It must seek to break through them. Only this could free the postulate of profundity from ideology. Surviving in such resistance is the speculative moment: that which does not allow its law to be prescribed to it by the given facts, yet transcends those facts in the closest contact with the objects and in renunciation of any sacrosanct transcendence. That by virtue of which thinking exceeds that to which it is resistingly bound, is thinking's freedom. It follows the subject's drive to expression. The need to allow suffering to become eloquent is the condition of all truth. For suffering is objectivity weighing on the subject; what it experiences as its most subjective element, its expres sion, is objectively mediated.23 It is already clear that "speculative" here retains something of its every day sense. This is thinking which "does not allow its law to be prescribed to it by the given facts". What saves this from being merely wishful think 22. Ibid., p. 397. 23. Ibid., p. 29.</page><page sequence="10">78 SIMON JARVIS ing? First of all, the "given facts" are not the things themselves but real illusions, the apparently inalterable propositions of identity thinking. Sec ondly, the facts are to be transcended "in the closest contact with the objects". Here Adorno is thinking of the way in which identificatory propo sitions classify objects, rather than saying what they are. So far the account fits with well-known features of Adorno's thinking. Thirdly, the facts are to be transcended "in renunciation of any sacrosanct transcendence". This is undoubtedly the most puzzling aspect of "speculative" thinking as it is understood here. Just where we come to the point where we might expect to hear how the first two aspects of speculative thinking are to be made good, we run into a wall. How can anything at all be transcended in renun ciation of transcendence? This would seem to be an obviously self-defeat ing enterprise. What follows then perplexes, rather than clearing, the para dox. Something called "thinking's freedom" exceeds that to which it is resistingly bound (presumably, the 'facts' in the sense of real illusions adverted to earlier.) Yet towards the end of the passage, a clue emerges. The 'freedom' which thinking has is not, say, an arbitrary disposition over choices. Nor yet is it a freedom from entanglements or commitments. It is, instead, an expres sion of suffering. Thinking, powerless to make suffering go away, yet has this single freedom: to express, without legitimizing, its suffering. That is where 'speculative' thinking survives. Further questions rush in at once. In what sense does thinking suffer at all? Isn't suffering feeling, not thinking; wouldn't thinking be a reflection on suffering, the consideration of propositions about it, rather than the expression of it? Here it becomes clear that Adorno is not only working with an unusual sense of 'speculative' thinking, but also with an unusual conception of 'thinking' as such. The body thinks. The ontology in which the body provides data-sets ready to be formed or reflected upon or brack eted or given a meaning by consciousness is rejected. Just where Adorno is explaining how negative dialectic makes its "transition" to materialism - that is, just where he is explaining how negative differs from idealist dialectic — we find this developed more explicitly. That the cognitive achievements of the subject of knowledge are, by virtue of their very meaning, somatic, does not only affect the foundational relationship of subject and object but also the dignity of the bodily. The bodily emerges, at the ontical pole of subjective knowl edge, as the core of such knowledge. That dethrones the guiding idea of epistemology, to constitute the body as the law of the relationship be tween sensations and acts, that is, to constitute it as something intellec tual; sensations are in themselves already what systematic thinking would</page><page sequence="11">WHAT IS SPECULATIVE THINKING? 79 like to set out as the way in which they have been shaped by conscious ness.24 Pain is not an object of knowledge. Sensations are not givens, data proc essed by consciousness, but the "core" of consciousness's knowledge. The body has been thrown into the 'object' box of an ontology carved up between subject and object; there is no more reason why it should go there than in the 'subject' box. Philosophical and phenomenological conceptions of thinking have not merely bracketed out the phenomenal - everything whose reality it is possible for me to doubt. They have also, in a by no means consequent but fateful further step, treated all affectivity as part of this phenomenal realm. The body is therefore understood as part of what needs to be bracketed if thinking is to be thinking. Against this, Adorno is developing a conception of thinking in which somatic contamination is not merely not an impurity, but a condition of thinking's possibility. This explains why Adorno's sense for 'speculative' thinking is so unu sual. 'Speculative' thinking is customarily thought of as the polar opposite of 'materialist' thinking. For Adorno, by contrast, these expressions are two ways of saying the same thing. A thinking which just puts the object in the place which the subject occupies in idealism is still idealist. So a 'ma terialist' thinking faces just the same problem as what Adorno has called 'speculative' thinking: it has, not merely to promote thoughtless data to the subject's place of honour, but to allow bodily experience to speak.25 This requires a new conception of 'thinking' as doubly impure, doubly materially contaminated - and this, not as a permissible or accidental fea ture of thinking but as essential to its character as thinking. On the one hand, thinking is materially contaminated on the 'objective' side. "'Some thing', as a substrate necessary to the thinkability of the concept, even of the concept of Being, is the utmost abstraction of that matter at hand which is not identical with thinking, yet an abstraction which cannot by any fur ther process of thinking be done away with; without 'Something', formal logic cannot be thought. Formal logic cannot be cleansed of its metalogical 24. Ibid., p. 194. Here it is of interest that when Adorno was trying elsewhere to explain what he meant by a 'speculative' power in Hegel's thinking - a power by no means identical with Hegel's own understanding of the speculative proposition, etc., but also, Adorno claims, to be found in his critic, Kierkegaard - he wrote of the "spiritual body" which develops in their authorships. Drei Studien zu Hegel, p. 52. 25. In this collection see also Yvonne Sherratt, "Adorno's Concept of the Self: A Marriage of Freud and Hegelian Marxism" and Brian O'connor, "Adorno and the Problem of Givenness" for alternative readings of the complex relation between 'material and 'ideal' in Adorno's work.</page><page sequence="12">80 SIMON JARVIS rudiment."26 On the other hand, thinking is materially contaminated on the 'subjective' side. "The thought without a need, the thought which did not wish for anything, would be nothing-like [nichtig]...".11 Indeed, there is in reality no thinking without a need, only the chimerical idea of one. Yet the way in which this quotation (which is part of Adorno's discussion of the "ontological need" in Heidegger's thinking) concludes suggests the prob lems which immediately follow upon the suggestion that desire is essential to thinking: "The thought without a need, the thought which did not wish for anything, would be nothing-like; but thinking which proceeds from need goes wrong, when the need is merely subjectively represented. Needs are a conglomerate of true and false; that thought would be true which could wish rightly."28 Evident here is the extent of the transformation wrought by Adorno's reformulation of the body as cognitive. No longer brute data, its needs and desires may now be true, false, or a thoroughly entangled web of the two; just as formal logic is no longer something prior to or apart from the body but one of its most refined adventures. That all thinking is somatically contaminated does not mean that anything I think is true, but that anything I feel could be false. This problem, first stated with reference to fundamental ontology, is returned to at the close of the book: That the wish is a bad father to the thought has since Xenophanes been one of the general theses of European enlightenment, and is still undilutedly valid against ontological attempts at restoration. Yet think ing, itself a mode of behaviour, contains need - and first of all the need to survive - inside itself. Thinking proceeds from need even where wish ful thinking is rejected.The motor of need is that of the labour which thinking, as doing, involves. The object of critique is therefore not the need in thinking but the relation between the two. The need in thinking wishes for thought. It demands its own negation through thinking, must disappear in thinking, if it is to be satisfied in reality, and in this nega tion it persists, it represents in the innermost cell of thought, that which is not the same as thought. The smallest feature of the world would be relevant to the absolute, for the micrological gaze shatters the shell of what has been helplessly individuated according to the measure of the subsumptive cover-concept and explodes its identity, the deception that it is merely an example. Such thinking is in solidarity with metaphysics at the moment of the demise of metaphysics.29 26. Negative Dialektik, p. 139. 27. Ibid., p. 100. 28. Ibid. 29. Ibid., pp. 399-400.</page><page sequence="13">WHAT IS SPECULATIVE THINKING? 81 Here in the last sentences of the book we arrive at Adorno's most deci sive formulation of what he has elsewhere described as 'speculative' think ing. It is decisive because it brings together, speculatively, the two kinds of implicatedness under which thinking labours and which make thinking possible. Thinking may come to interpret what is not in any way the same as it, not in so far as it erases its own bodily character, but rather just because of that character. A thought which did not wish for anything would not be like anything, would not be a thought. The bodily, because it is at the 'core' of thinking, in its 'innermost cell', is what allows thinking to inter pret, without subsuming, the non-identical. Thinking's debt to the body allows it to own its debt to the object. 3. If 'the need to allow suffering to become eloquent is the condition of all truth', why wouldn't a cry of pain be the best philosophy? Adorno's clos ing pages do not solve a problem, but define a task. There is still an "object of critique". No longer is this object the overreaching of speculative rea son, but rather the relation between 'need' and 'thinking'. Wherever, as the earlier passage puts it, a need is "merely subjectively" represented, it becomes subject to this critique. So that the 'cry of pain' is indeed the standard for what the writing is trying to achieve. However elaborate the issues which philosophical writing must address, it yet must meet this test of crying out, rather than crying wolf. Just as not all pain is like toothache ■or a bullet-wound, so thinking's expression of suffering may be more ar ticulated than a shout. In truth, a cry of pain is already a complex shape of thinking: no pure reflex but an expression whose pitch, duration, intona tion, and cadence will all be parts of its meaning. At the same time, it is performative. It is not an attempt to provide a conceptual adequation to an array of facts. It expresses knowing-suffering at the same time as it wishes by that act of expression to bring it to an end. This performative character, at once expressive and therapeutic, is essential to what Adorno understands by 'speculative thinking'; and this, rather than some mechanism of alibi, accounts for what is found the "remorselessly judgemental" tone of his work. The thought which would "unlock", "shatter" or "explode" the con text of immanence is a favourite topic of Adorno's. It is a topic closely connected to the insistence that it is time not for first philosophy, but last philosophy, in the specific sense that the only ontology furnished by Nega tive Dialectics is the ontology of the wrong state of things. The book as a</page><page sequence="14">82 SIMON JARVIS whole can then be understood as an attempt to break this spell by naming it. It is true in one sense that this aspect of Adorno's work, the language of performative efficacity, of breaking spells, of opening sesames, of deci phering encryptions must be figurative: the magic which Adorno's thought compositions would dispel is not literal magic, but a 'second' magic, the false naturalization or eternalization of mutable forms of experience. Yet it is no mere superstructure. Nor is it sufficient to think of this kind of talk as a remnant of a procedure characteristic of Adorno's thinking and writing from an early stage: the chiasmic application of correctives. (An instance of such a chiasm is the way in which the disenchantment exercised by Xenophanes upon anthropomorphic religion can be admitted to be entirely justified, whilst at the same time the essentially performative conception of truth connected with such religion can itself be employed as a corrective upon, or "has a truth-content with respect to" the superstitions of an enlightenment which has turned into mass deception.) Nevertheless, the efficacity of these hoped-for second-magical powers is not the decisive test of this 'speculative thinking'. Were it so, the verdict could only be one of failure. This provides clues as to how such thinking can now renew itself. 1. Adorno's admirers are not obliged to agree with him that "only the exaggerations are true". "How do you know?" remains a good question wherever knowledge is asserted. The exaggerations - corrective, provoca tive, bracing - are there to protect fundamental questions about experience from being deleted on the dubious grounds of their (possibly temporary) unanswerability. They are there so that philosophical writing need not restrict its corpus to the sum total of perfectly certain propositions. Yet their own vehemence may become a smokescreen. "We do not know yet" is truer than "we do not know", Adorno remarks;30 speculative thinking concerns all those questions which can neither yet be answered nor yet proven poorly formed. Why may its moods of writing not be interrogative and subjunctive as often as they are indicative or performative? Suspend ing a prohibition on a question need not require the assertion, "provoca tive", "corrective", or otherwise, of an indemonstrable answer. 2. If it ever was 'time' for "last" philosophy it is no longer so. The account of thinking given above demands a new phenomenology of affect. A phenomenology: for what else is thinking which suspends "given facts...in 30.

In one sense, such a phe nomenology is intimated in a work like Minima Moralia. Yet in another, it remains properly to be begun. If it is true that "Consciousness could not even despair over the grey, did it not harbour the concept of a different colour, whose scattered traces are not absent from the negative whole",31 it can become a settled loss of nerve to tell ourselves that these traces are none the less in current circumstances too friable to be approached other than through despair; especially when current circumstances turn out to go on and on being current. That I think and feel this and this and this, I cannot in any case manage to doubt, however hard my scepticism tries to help me; whether I can utter a single word "true" to that experience even in the most trivial, yet alone in Adorno's complex and multiply articulated, sense, re mains uncertain. A phenomenology of affect might, if we can imagine this, owe at least as much to Proust as to Husserl. It would only ever suspend the phenomenon's objectivity, instead of expelling all singular affect to the phenomenon in order that singularity and affect might both be suspended. At least one element of the speculative "turn against itself' which negative dialectic requires is a material phenomenology.32 Robinson College, Cambridge 31. Ibid., p. 370. 32. Referred to here is Michel Henry, Phénoménologie matérielle (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1990). Left undetermined as yet is whether all such material phenomenology need finally take the shape initiated by Henry, nor is the author ignorant that not all aspects of the latter are freely reconcilable with all aspects of Adorno's thinking. The final sentence cannot be made good in this short text. It offers instead a clue to new thinking at the end of an interpretation otherwise conducted for the most part immanently within the horizon of Adorno's thought. I should like to thank Keston Sutherland, Ross Wilson, and the students who worked through draft translations of Adorno's "Meditations on metaphysics" and Michel Henry's "Material phenomenology and hyletic phenomenology" with me at the Society for the Humanities, Cornell University, Fall 2000.</page></plain_text>
