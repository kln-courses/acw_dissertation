<plain_text><page sequence="1">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION? CONSTRUCTIVELY RECONCEPTUALISING (HUMAN) SCIENCE AND THE STUDY OF RELIGION Lieve Orye Abstract In the study of religion there is much discussion, to put it simply, between those arguing for a humanistic or for other forms of a non-reductionist study of religion and those opposing "the humanistic manoeuvre" and what they see as attempts to retheologise the discipline. Donald Wiebe, whose work occupies centre stage in this article, participates extensively in these debates and is a fervent spokesperson for the latter group. In this article I want to inject in these debates Latour's constructivist perspective on science. Such a perspective involves a call to "go beyond the centrality of beliefs" and hence involves a quite different view on human beings and science fiom those underlying the debates. Similarities with Cantwell Smith's work are shown and a suggestion is made to jointly discover/ construct a symmetrical anthropology that will be useful to the study of religion. The main argument, however, is that from this new perspective, which should stimulate renewed debate about "the role of belief" and other issues, the warnings by Don Wiebe against the introduction of extra-scientific motives and against a blurring of the line between religion and the study of religion remain valid. 1. Wiebe's worries: a multiplication of identity crises A persistent and clear agenda can be found throughout the work of Donald Wiebe. His concern is with the study of religion as a scientific enterprise. The field of religious studies is facing some fundamental problems. He talks and writes about an identity crisis in the field, gen erating a lot of theoretical reflection. Recently, however, the crisis has intensified through the strengthening of the theological camp by those who want to dissolve rationality. (Wiebe 1997: 167) Whereas first an identity was formed but constantly undermined by those who let non scientific, religious motives interfere with their scientific views, this time the scientific identity itself is in grave danger. In humanities and phi losophy departments science itself seems under deconstruction. It is seen as just another social practice, while talk about its special status is © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2005 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion Also available online - www.brill.nl 17, 337-363</page><page sequence="2">338 LIEVE ORYE studied under topics such as "politics of silencing," "hegemonic strate gies" or "power struggles." A postmodern mood seems to hold hostage much of the human sciences, the study of religion included. As Wiebe notes: . . . the operational meaning of postmodernism in the study of religion appears to be roughly what it is elsewhere—a hostility to the possibility of objective knowledge of the facts about religions and their theoretical explanation and an espousal of the notion that knowledge of religions, as of any other social phenomenon, is always local and not general in that it is necessarily linked to a particular person in a particular culture at a particular time. (Wiebe 1997: 174) In what follows I want to support Wiebe's plea against a retheologisation or a humanisation of the field by injecting a quite different perspective on science into these debates. I will argue that his plea for "a particular kind of conversation," for the appropriation of "religion" in that con versation by scientists and for a clear demarcation between subject mat ter and discipline can and should be taken seriously. I will, however, seek support from "the enemy". That is, I will develop an argument in which I will first draw attention to Bruno Latour's work, showing that he rather sides with Wiebe against postmodernists and science debunkers; later I will turn to Cantwell Smith's work. Both these authors figure as antagonists in Wiebe's work. However, through their work an argument in support of Wiebe's main points will be developed, lead ing us into the non-modern world of a symmetrical anthropology and towards a view of human beings "beyond the centrality of beliefs". I will argue that in mapping this world religious studies can contribute much. Nevertheless, that will only be possible if the warnings by Wiebe against the introduction of extra-scientific motives and against a blur ring of the line between religion and the study of religion are taken seriously. 2. Bruno Latour, a debunker of science? Wiebe refers to Bruno Latour's work mostly through other authors. A first instance is when he mentions in support of his internal criticism of postmodernism the book Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science (1994), written by Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt. (Wiebe 1997: 182) The authors analyze and attempt to refute different kinds of critique of science and start with an evaluation of the cultural constructivist approach of science in its weak and strong form. The</page><page sequence="3">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION? 339 result is a chapter in which Latour's work with that of others is relegated to the dustbin as postmodernist hotchpotch. However, Latour seems to be an author bound to be situated in one's opposite corner. While Gross and Levitt (1994: 57) portray him as a debunker of science, with iconoclastic purposes, David Bloor, another of their targets and quite angry about their follow-up volume The Flight from Science and Reason (Gross et al. 1996), sees Latour as belonging to their own ranks, that is, the ranks of those "who have only to see the label 'sociology of knowledge' to conclude that its doctrines must imply the absurdity that knowledge is 'purely social'." (Bloor 1999: 104) For Bloor (1999: 91), Latour's ideas are just one more example of "direct realism" or "naïve realism". However, Gross' and Levitt's use of the term "iconoclastic" is ironic when seen against Latour's more recent work on "iconoclash" and "iconoclasm"1 and, when reading his responses to the literature in which the science wars are spun out, one soon realises that the goal of debunk ing or delegitimizing science is not his. In my view, a misunderstanding of his work often leads to this attribution. Gross and Levitt seem to realise that Latour isn't easily caught in one box. However, they turn this against him as well, when they write: Latour is always ready to recast and, in effect, retract what he has pre viously said. In other contexts he will, with an apparently straight face, admit that there is a natural universe "out there" and that scientific the ories are shaped by it in important ways. Simultaneously, he will censure rigorously the dogmatics of strict cultural constructivism. Just as he pic tures (literally) the mind-set of science as a Janus-faced dualist, he too is constantly springing from one side of a dichotomy to the other. (Gross and Levitt 1994: 59) It might, however, be a case of constantly springing from one position to another only to the critic who does not realise Latour's attempts to leave the dichotomy behind. Similar issues play in Latour's discussion with David Bloor. In his response to Bloor's "Anti-Latour", Latour thinks Bloor to be right in everything he wrote from his own point of view. 1 See his (1998) A Few Steps toward the Anthropology of the Iconoclastic Gesture, in Science in Context, 10(1), 63-83, his (1998) How to be Iconophilic in Art, Science and Religion in Picturing Science Producing Art by Carrie Jones and Peter Galison (eds), Routledge, London, his (2001) What is Iconoclash? or Is there a world beyond the image wars? Introduction to the catalog of the exhibit Iconoclash—Beyond the Image-Wars in Science, Religion and Art (edited by Peter Weibel and Bruno Latour) ZKM &amp; MIT Press.</page><page sequence="4">340 LIE VE ORYE There is no other way to see my work and that of my many colleagues who have, more or less quickly, abandoned the first attempts of the Edinburgh School at understanding science. The problem, of course, is that David's point of view is not the right one to evaluate our work from. What he sees as the main sources of obscurity, are the source, for all of us, of our main claim to analytical clarity. (Latour 1999b: 114) A second time Wiebe (2000) comes across Latour's work is when he reviews Catherine Bell's article on modernism and postmodernism in the study of religion. Bell (1996) reviews two books seen as exemplary for the modernist debate, Preus's Explaining Religion (1987) and Lawson's and McCauley's Rethinking Religion (1990); Asad's Genealogies of Religion (1993) is taken as a postmodernist example. For Bell different issues are tackled in modernist and post-modernist debates and, while the Enlightenment paradigm, interpreted as a model "pushing for the absolute polarization of religion and science" (Bell 1996: 179) figures cen trally in both debates, each has largely ignored the other. The modernist debate, with Wiebe as one of its participants, is about demonstrating the superiority of scientific methods and frameworks as against the the ological and confessional frameworks. The postmodern debate focuses on the Enlightenment model's problems: "the political, cultural, and epistemological dynamics involved in the generation of universal cate gories like "religion" and their application in explanations and inter pretations of other cultural practices." (Bell 1996: 179) In "Dissolving Rationality", Wiebe (2000) ignores this postmodern debate no longer and he claims that the situation has deteriorated considerably. Post modernists are seen to strengthen the ranks of those "small c" and "large C" confessionalists Wiebe argues against, causing not simply an iden tity crisis in religious studies but a crisis about the identity of science itself. Bell's resort to Latour's work as a way out only seems more of the same. She puts question marks on the modernist trust that science will provide us with objective knowledge. Non-rational influences upon sci ence undermine it, opening the doors for a theological framework in the study of religion. Nevertheless, Bell does not make a choice for the postmodern framework over against the modern one, claiming that in neither does the outsider-insider tension find resolution. "In both the modernist and postmodernist debates are variations of a fundamental polarization between "insider" claims to experience something in one set of terms and "outsider" claims to explain that experience in very different terms." (Bell 1996: 187) Bruno Latour's work on science is pointed to as a third option, suggesting that the absolute polarisation of religion</page><page sequence="5">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 341 and science and of insider and outsider might be historically situated. She is however aware of the difficulties that lie ahead: "It is one thing, of course, to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of modernist and postmodernist critiques of the study of religion; it is another thing to suggest what scholarship should look like." (Bell 1996: 188) She sees a starting point in Latour's guidelines for a new form of sociology that are designed to break down the great divide created by classical soci ology between them and us and between premodern and modern. Latour proposes a symmetrical anthropology that posits an initial sym metry between the studier and the studied, and for Bell this contains the promise for a different, non-modern framework in which there seems to be the possibility of some type of science of religion that is not universal or hegemonic. Wiebe is not convinced and takes a closer look at Bruno Latour's We have Never been Modem (1993). (See Wiebe 2000: 360-362) In that book he sees Latour as arguing against the idea that science is a modern phenomenon distinguishable from traditional thinking. According to Latour a distinction is unwarranted; there is no need to create a divide between pre-logical and logical cultures. Indeed, Latour maintains, writes Wiebe, that our culture must be studied in the same way archaic cul tures are studied—anthropologically—because there is no fundamental difference between ancients and moderns. Wiebe is surprised to find Latour arguing nevertheless that being pre-modern would hinder sci ence seriously. He seeks to keep the moderns' major innovation: "the separability of a nature that no one has constructed—transcendence— and the freedom of manoeuvre of a society that is of our making— immanence." (Latour 1993: 140, cited by Wiebe, 2000: 361) Latour appears again to dance from one foot to the other, rejecting, then affirming, modernity; in other words, Gross and Levitt's image of con stant springing is confirmed. It leads Wiebe to conclude that, since Latour's analysis of modern science shows many difficulties, it is hard to see how it can lead us to a possible alternative. Still, I will go down that same road, although I will argue that it does not lead us to a blurring of the line between religion and the study of religion. I will first show how Wiebe's own work makes room for a constructivist view of science. In a next step, I will outline one of the discussions often elicited by Wiebe's work and will show subsequendy how Latour's sym metrical anthropology can be seen as an ally in the struggle for a scientific study of religion.</page><page sequence="6">342 LIE VE ORYE 3. A cons true tivist study of meteorology In The Politics of Religious Studies (1999), Wiebe has collected together some of his articles that share a common purpose, namely, the defence of the academic study of religion as a genuinely scientific discipline. He defines "scientific" in the following way: "by "scientific" I mean the attempt only to understand and explain that activity rather than to be involved in it." (Wiebe 1999: ix) The book is presented as an attempt to change the balance, at present tilted in favour of a reappropriation of the field by religious forces and transforming what should be science into an avenue for the re-establishment of a religious agenda, completely the other way. Wiebe wants to re-establish a science of religion that eschews politico-ideological interference of any kind, to which he adds, "of any kind, even though the field of religious studies as a whole pos sesses an inevitably political quality." (Wiebe 1999: ix) For Wiebe the discipline is in such disarray that the political act of founding the science of religion is to be done again. This means amongst other things that, just as the study of political behaviour is to be demarcated from polit ical behaviour itself, a clear line needs to be drawn between the study of religion and its subject matter. Religious criteria and interference from religious and other non-scientific motives and goals with theory formation and methodology are to be banned. The last chapter of the book, "Appropriating Religion" can be seen as further argumentation for such a political act. Wiebe hopes to make a positive contribution to the discipline by directing attention to the study of religion as a scientific project and by presenting proposals for acdon. (Wiebe 1999: 280) The central goal is stated clearly: whereas the appropriation of religion for the benefit of self and society leads to the detriment of academic advancement, the first task is to reappropriate it wholly by science. Moreover, writes Wiebe: ... to go one step further, given the hold on the concept of religion by those committed to the humanistic study of religion, we might need to talk here not of the appropriation but of expropriation of religion by sci ence—that is, of wresting ownership of the concept from the humanists by using it solely as a taxonomic device to differentiate and explain a peculiar range of human behavior demonstrated in religious practices. (Wiebe 1999: 281) In his further argumentation Wiebe (1999: 281-283) makes use of "a constructivist reading of the emergence of the new meteorological science" by Robert Friedman. Important is the use of the notion constructivism, not social constructivism in the title. Wiebe quotes Friedman, who states that</page><page sequence="7">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 343 "[h]ard facts were not waiting in nature to be uncovered," rather, new concepts and models were created "by drawing upon analogy, metaphor, existing theory, and ad hoc construction [thereby transforming] insights, speculations, and hypothetical entities into stable scientific 'reality' by inte grating them into a structure of meaning and by devising analytical tech niques with which the constructs could be regularly reproduced." (Friedman, 1989: 243) (Wiebe 1999: 281, italics added) Wiebe's ideas about a political side to science harmonize quite easily with Latour's constructivist ideas about science. "A particular kind of conversation" might be interpreted as referring to that kind of conversation and activity in which facts are constructed (in the constructivist, not the social constructivist sense) and become stabilized, a phenomenon Friedman describes in the field of meteorology and a phenomenon Latour has analysed in more general terms, (e.g. Latour 1999a) In such a view on science the question is not whether the scholar can be freed from social, political, and cultural constraints as Phillip Lucas puts it in his review of the Guide in which Wiebe's article on modernism appeared (Lucas 2001: 437), but whether the instruments we use help us in getting reality to talk. Science needs its social surroundings, its interaction with society, as Friedman in his study of meteorology makes clear. He writes, "the concepts and models of the new Bergen school of meteorology "were not the inevitable result of observation and theory" (1989: 243) but. . . they were theory-laden and even practice-laden; they were the result not only of simple interaction with nature, but also of complex interactions between scientists and society." (Wiebe 1999: 281) In this light one could see Wiebe's plea for a scientific study of religion and against a retheologisation and humanisation of the field as a plea to take these interactions seriously and to evaluate skilfully their contribution, or lack thereof, in our endeavour to arrive at scientific knowledge. Introducing theological or humanistic concerns would hijack this endeavour or sideline it, safeguarding some theories, views and explanations against such an evaluation, thus turning science into a non-scientific endeavour. Nevertheless the constructivist language is a language we're not yet used to, and Wiebe feels the need to confirm that Bjerknes, the scientist who's work was studied by Friedman, was not merely engaged in subjective and constructivist work,2 that he pur sued scientific goals like rational predictions open to empirical testing, that he did not manufacture reality to fit into his theory. The creators 2 Though Wiebe makes ample use of Friedman's study, he's rather disapprov ing of constructivism, also when it is applied to religion. In the latter case, the</page><page sequence="8">344 LIEVE ORYE of the new science, Wiebe writes, "were not responsible for the reality commanding their attention; for there were indeed "hard facts" . . . Let me be clear: in seeing this science as constructive, Friedman is not nec essarily denying that meteorology made discoveries. But he seems to be asserting that the science is nevertheless in some sense creating the reality with which it is dealing." (Wiebe 1999: 283) For Wiebe (1999: 289) the moral of Friedman's story is the need for theory, for clear ideas about what constitutes scientific knowledge of religion and the need to frame a research program to unify the field. The exercise of "appropriating religion" should be understood in terms of reshaping the epistemic situation in the study of religion. Science studies, such as the one by Friedman, make plain that this is not a merely abstract philosophical issue, but, as Wiebe emphasizes, involves politics. Friedman claims that Bjerknes grasped the social processes of science and that, as conditions affecting his research program changed, he succeeded in taking adaptive measures to continue advancing his disciplinary aims. (Friedman 1989: xii) For Friedman the notion of "ap propriating the weather" is meant to make clear that the central theme of the book is that " [s] cientific disciplines are also social systems in which members pursue, negotiate for, and compete for authority and resources with which to participate in, if not direct, the production and circulation of knowledge." (Friedman 1989: xii) Rather than a history of a science in which a brilliant mind closes himself off from society and finds out what reality is like through meticulous deduction, induction or the use of any other philosophical model for knowledge production, a history of doing and developing a science is narrated, in which nature and society, theory and practice are inseparable, painting Bjerknes as a disciplinary entrepreneur. He is painted as a man, who becomes skilled in many aspects of doing science and who succeeds in transforming the explanatory scheme for weather from folklore to science as he, with others, sets forth simultaneously a new way of forecasting weather and a new cyclone model. (Friedman 1989: 177) It is important to see that Wiebe, in arguing for the appropriation of "religion", asks us not to be so much interested in Friedman's exer cise of studying a science, but in Bjerknes exercise of appropriating the weather. The latter has been a success story and a similar success is idea that "religion" is the product of the scholar's attention rather than an inde pendent reality, as can be found in Russell McCutcheon's work, is not an idea shared by Wiebe. (1999: 295) In my opinion, constructivism is interpreted here as social constructivism, that is, interpreted within the boundaries of those dichotomies Latour and others reject.</page><page sequence="9">RE APPROPRIATING 'RELIGION? 345 hoped for in the study of religion. We should identify with the subject matter, Bjerknes, the scientist doing science, not with the scientist study ing science, looking at science in constructivist terms and presenting us with an image of a scientist we can identify with. It was Bjerknes who saw his problems in political terms; it was he, writes Wiebe, who grasped the outlines of a political economy of institutionalized sci ence, and adapted his strategies to the ecological relations within and among disciplines' (1989: 237), and paradoxical as it may sound given my comments above, we too will need to be politically active in our own way within our universities and professional associations if we are not to see our field of research and analysis overcome by politico-religious forces. . . . (Wiebe 1999: 289) 4. Still traces of an ideological agenda? In arguing for the need to establish a genuine scientific study of religion Wiebe shows us the successful case of meteorology, uses some constructivist language in the exercise, and infers some general lessons from it. Some might have stopped reading his last chapter beyond the first few lines, thinking that once again a case is made for a social science that imitates natural science, and in a very general way, it is. Like Bjerknes we should understand the proper role of theory as a unifying framework and so end the rule of a polymethodism that is inspired not by theory but by the assumption of the goodness and value of religion and of a responsibility for the welfare of society. (Wiebe 1999: 284) The question is whether he is able to convince his opponents that this is the way forward. Those insisting on a fundamental difference between human and natural science might not follow his lead. Though Wiebe insists he is not arguing for an affinity between the weather and religion, others might still feel he is arguing once again for a reductionist approach, leaving out of the picture what is specifically human, specifically reli gious—his suggestion to reconsider evolutionary theory as a unifying framework most likely intensifies this feeling. Though Wiebe wants us to identify with a very human-like scientist, the fear might be that nev ertheless in the end a parallel is to be drawn between the weather as an object of study and religion as an object of study, things about which only the scientist has sensible things to say. As far as the weather is concerned, most people would applaud the transition from folklorist methods of forecasting to scientific methods, though some might claim it involves a denial of the skills in forecasting the weather they devel oped as sailors or farmers. But in the case of religion, things are different.</page><page sequence="10">346 LIEVE ORYE People are involved, people with a mind of their own that needs to be taken into account. This statement forms the nucleus of many an argu ment for a fundamental difference between the human and the natu ral sciences. And it leads many to conclude that though arguing for non-interference between extra-scientific goals and theory might be the way forward in the natural sciences, in the human sciences that road is blocked because of the nature of the subject matter. In other words, the path towards humanisation and retheologisation is once more open again. Not surprisingly, a lot of vigour in countering Wiebe has to do with his opposition to the humanistic approach and his claim that "personal explanations in terms of persons' motives and desires, such as are used by historians and lawyers and indeed in everyday life" are not to be seen as normative for human science. Rather, for him the subject matter "human beings" does not entail that the explanatory concepts must also be "human" but may be quite reasonably causal in form. (Sherry 1999: 102) As Pals notes in his review of The Politics of Religious Studies (1999), "the real source of Wiebe's distress lies in what we can call the "humanist maneuver" in religious studies". He summarizes this maneuver concisely as follows: Most religionists start from the assumption that the beliefs and behaviors they examine are products of human thought, intention and emotion. Accordingly, they judge religion to be a phenomenon that does not lend itself well to empirically testable social-scientific theories. Religious activity needs instead to be approached through humanistic categories. It is best understood when scholars apply to it the same rules of analysis, evidence and logic used in philosophy, history and literature. Like these subjects, religion invites both scholar and student to engage enduring human ques tions. (Pals 1999: 857) The issue has been the subject matter of an extensive exchange between Daniel Pals and Don Wiebe (involving Lome Dawson and Robert Segal) since the midst of the 1980's. Pals defends religious studies as an autonomous discipline by drawing the card of "humanistic explanations" and presents this, in contrast with Wiebe's views, as a non-theological approach that is nonetheless much more in accord with the "believer's point of view" and as such less reductionistic than non-humanistic approaches. They [believers] will reject it [humanistic explanation], to be sure, if it rigorously excludes any recourse to supernatural realities. But precisely because by definition the humanistic account admits the believer's self perceived reasons, desires, and thoughts as real causes of his belief, they</page><page sequence="11">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 347 will find it more acceptable, or—better said—less erroneous, than the psy chological reductionism of Freud, which rejects not only the beliefs, but discredits humanistic reasons for beliefs as well. In brief, humanistic expla nations are more likely to be compatible with belief, not because humanist explanation is theological, but because, almost invariably, theological self understandings happen also to be humanistic. (Pals 1990b: 35) Pals does not deny the affinity between theological and humanistic approaches, but is not prepared to see this as an argument for the theo logical or non-scientific nature of humanistic approaches. Rather, the affinity is for him one more reason for the superiority of the humanistic approach. He agrees with Wiebe that previously theological approaches were present in the field, arguing for autonomy in religious terms. It is, however, a category of scholars he does not belong to, since his own argument is not along religious, but "along modestly humanistic lines" (Pals 1990a: 10), as it was for many of the scholars wrongly accused of (crypto-)theological input. In other words, the focus has shifted from a religious reality to the religious person. This implies that religion is seen as a product of human thinking and acting or as institutions and tra ditions designed and developed by people. Autonomy is argued for, claiming that religious reasons, religious intentions and desires often suffice to explain a certain religious phenomenon. Such an explanation is identified as a humanistic religious explanation and is contrasted with theories "without appeal to agent intention" (Pals 1990b: 30). Pals sees himself as merely stating the disciplinary axiom—that no account is adequate until it makes recourse to humanistic categories—and seeks sup port from the larger human science community by drawing attention to larger issues involved: the perennial dilemmas of subjectivity and objectivity, of interested participants in a disinterested science. He argues that we ought not to see these discussions in religious studies in isola tion from the analogous circumstances of other disciplines. (Pals 1990b: 2) The verdict on his opponent is simple: Wiebe seems, as Michael Levine (1997: 385) argues as well, to lump together the issue of a religious agenda with that of a basically humanistic instead of "scientific" approach. As a consequence, he seems blind to the possibility of a third humanistic option, taken seriously across the human sciences. Pals' arguments do not convince Wiebe, even though he appreciates their thoroughness. Rather he concludes that without further reformulation and clarification of his arguments Pals can only contribute to the fur ther subtle insinuation of theology into this field and to the academic legitimation of a variety of crypto-theologies under the banner of Religious Studies. (Wiebe 1990: 28) Wiebe seems to have been more than right.</page><page sequence="12">348 LIEVE ORYE In his review of The Politics of Religious Studies (1999) Pals turns more extreme than ever, opening the central door to theology, arguing that cognitive dissidents, most of whom enter academic debate with prior motives and agendas, including theological agendas, provide the criti cal, adverserial edge science needs. "Wiebe wants confessionalism elim inated from the discipline. But one can just as reasonably be concerned that religionists are too little, rather than too much, animated by the ological interests. .." (Pals 1999: 855) However, the complaint of lumping together a religious agenda with the issue of a basically humanistic instead of scientific approach can be seen in a different light. Both a religious and a humanistic agenda opposing a scientific approach might still be examples of a similar under lying mistake. In both cases, the argument seems to take the following form: a reductionist science leaves something out, something specifically religious, something specifically human; to get this "something more" into the picture again a different methodology is argued for. Reductionist science is held responsible for many shortcomings of our society and through a different form of science in which the "something more"— usually "meaning"—is given a prominent place, contributions can be made to a better society. In other words, non-scientific, humanistic goals can easily interfere with theory formation and methodology. If "crypto theological" stands for this interference, Pals' argument turning theo logy into a special case of the humanistic approach can be turned on its head again, with the humanistic approach as one more instance of crypto-theology. Though Wiebe is, in the first instance, concerned with the study of religion and develops his vocabulary within this field, there is no reason to believe that the mistake he points to is limited to this field. The conclusion could be warranted that even outside the study of religion a large amount of "theology"—of non-scientific input and a safeguarding of assumptions due to interference from extra-scientific goals—can be found. Still, a convincing answer that such interference is indeed avoidable in the human sciences has not yet been provided. One seems to have to make a choice either for science or for humanity. In the first case, a rather inhumane view of human beings seems to be the consequence; in the second case, one has to accept that the human sciences are fun damentally different from the natural sciences. In my judgment, the persistence of proposals for non-reductionist approaches should be taken seriously. It might tell us that something is not right with what the scientific study of human beings has come up with so far. One can easily agree with Wiebe, paraphrasing Ernest Gellner, that "it is especially</page><page sequence="13">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 349 the discussion about the human subject around which obscurity swirls and in which relativism is, so to speak, established." (Wiebe 1997: 177) In the following section I want to show how a constructivist reading of meteorology or of science more generally can be of use here as well. Whereas Wiebe asks us to identify with Bjerknes in establishing a scientific study of religion through political action by drawing a parallel between the act of appropriating the weather and the appropriation of "religion", one can also value Latour's science studies for its merits as a human science and parallel religion and science or the religious person and the scientist. 5. Science "on the ground" in a symmetrical anthropology Latour's argument for an anthropology of science is in some ways sim ilar to Ninian Smart's recommendation that we study religion "on the ground". Science is to be studied empirically and "like all empirical work, such studies have the unsettling quality of forcing you to move heaven and earth in order to try to follow what happens in practice." (Latour 1999b: 115) In other words, his symmetrical anthropology differs from proposals for rehumanisation or retheologisation in that it does not try to exchange an out-moded normative model for science, seen as reductionist because it emphasizes either nature or society, for a new model in which, through the introduction of "new ways of knowing" (usually the kind in which one tries to bridge the insider and outsider perspective) room is made for "that which makes us human". Science studies leave the philosophizing behind for observation and analysis of the phenomenon in the field—"on the ground". When Latour argues that in such a study "on the ground" science should be treated in the same way as so-called pre-modern modes of thought, it is important to realise that Latour is once more constructing an anthropological argument. Treating two things the same way does not mean that one presumes them to be two of a kind. It is also important to realize that although Latour feels indebted to Bloor's symmetry principle, the program he proposes is very different from the Strong Program that Bloor advocates. Bloor sees the "sym metry postulate" as the main feature of the Strong Program: "Both true and false, rational and irrational ideas, in as far as they are col lectively held, should all equally be the object of sociological curiosity, and should all be explained by reference to the same kinds of cause.

(Bloor 1999: 83) The symmetry postulate, then, replaces the assumption that true or rational beliefs are to be explained by reference to reality, while false beliefs are to be explained by reference to soci ety and its distorting influence. This scheme is a familiar one for scholars of religion, often tempted to see religion as a case of the latter, or tempted to argue for its rationality, or attempting to escape the scheme altogether through arguing for the non-cognitive character of religion.3 However, as Bloor (1999: 84) correctly states, the symmetry postulate signals the rejection of such an anti-symmetrical approach, but the ques tion remains "what is the alternative?" Latour's Symmetry Principle—he sometimes talks of a "generalized symmetry principle"—is to be seen as an important step beyond Bloor's proposal as he argues for "one more turn after the social turn." (Latour 1992) The main difference Bloor sees between his position and Latour's is that the latter is asking for a wholesale opposition to the subject object scheme whereas he sees limitations but not a need to throw it out completely. But this is an understatement of the difference. Latour wants to leave the framework in which either nature or society is seen as a cause for some belief, for a scheme in which both nature and society are the very things to be explained. His symmetry principle sees the subjective and the objective, society and nature, as end-results (and as rather rare end-results needing processes of translation and purification to come into existence) requiring the same kind of explanation. Whereas the old views see the world in terms of purified categories and try to draw clear lines between them in order to arrive at understanding, Latour focuses on the mixed, hybridic, continuous, relational nature of phenomena and looks at the work done and the instruments used to create the purified categories of nature and society. It should be clear then, that the way both nature and society are explained differs dras tically from explanations in terms of either nature or society. Apart from seeing "nature" and "society" as explananda, another radical difference lies in what I call "a decentralisation of beliefs or representations in a relational world." In Pandora's Hope (1999a), Latour starts with the question "Do you believe in reality?" and promises some news from the trenches of the Science Wars. He takes issue with the view that science studies are anti-science and argues against it by decon structing the question. 3 Wiebe's first book Religion and truth: towards an alternative paradigm for the study of ion (1981) gives a very good impression and evaluation of the different positions oudined here.</page><page sequence="15">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION? 351 My compatriot Descartes had raised it [the question] against himself when asking how an isolated mind could be absolutely as opposed to relatively sure of anything about the outside world. Of course, he framed his ques tion in a way that made it impossible to give the only reasonable answer, which we in science studies have slowly rediscovered three centuries later: that we are relatively sure of many of the things with which we are daily engaged through the practice of our laboratories. . . . Descartes was ask ing for absolute certainty from a brain-in-a-vat, a certainty that was not needed, when the brain (or the mind) was firmly attached to its body and the body thoroughly involved in its normal ecology. (Latour 1999a: 4) Descartes found a positive answer claiming he could believe in reality because of God, but philosophers after him looked for different answers, culminating in the idea of "a world view," a system of beliefs and rep resentations given by society. (Latour 1999a: 6) This heritage of Descartes' question, of a centrality of beliefs and the proliferation of divides and dichotomies is still clearly present in Bloor's work. In his "Anti-Latour" article, he argues that Latour misrepresents the Strong Program: The aim isn't to explain nature, but to explain shared beliefs about nature. The enquiry is into the character and causes of knowledge, or what passes as knowledge and not (in general) into the objects which the knowledge is meant to be about. . . . both 'nature' (that is, non-social nature) and society will be implicated in the formation of belief. The symmetry to be insisted upon is that both types of cause, both our experience of the world of things and the world of people, will be implicated in all bodies of col lective belief. Systems of belief that is, shared and institutionalized forms of knowledge, are the medium through which people co-ordinate their shared interactions with non-social nature ... all cultures are equally near to nature. This means insisting that false systems of belief engage with nature according to the same principles as do true ones. (Bloor 1999: 86, 87, italics added) Rather than looking for yet another sophisticated answer to the ques tion "do you believe in reality" Latour questions it. The framework in terms of beliefs to be explained by nature or society or any combina tion of these is exchanged for a framework in which a very different view of human beings is outlined. His solution consists in a thorough questioning of the mind/body divide that underlies the Cartesian ques tion and replacing it with a relational view. He describes it in his own particular style as follows: This solution consists of taking only a part of the mind out of the vat and then doing the obvious thing, that is, offering it a body again and putting the reassembled aggregate back into relation with a world that is no longer a spectacle at which we gaze but a lived, self-evident, and unreflexive extension of ourselves. In appearance, the progress is immense,</page><page sequence="16">352 LIEVE ORYE and the descent into damnation suspended, since we no longer have a mind dealing with an outside world, but a lived world to which a semi conscious and intentional body is now attached. (Latour 1999a: 9) 6. Going "beyond the centrality of belief"—an enterprise across disciplines Latour's fight is not with science, but with certain conceptualisations of science. Developing a symmetrical anthropology, a new vocabulary still "under construction", is put forward that is no longer painted with the nature/society and mind/body brush. That is, Latour proposes a radically different way of envisioning the subject matter eliciting, as his discussion with Bloor illustrates, clashes with the "old paradigm" that "insists on assessing the new within the confines of the old, and by its standards." (Smith 1980: 247-8) The use of Cantwell Smith's language to talk about Latour's proposal may seem bold, even far-fetched, given that he is seen by many as an advocate for retheologising religious stud ies. Nevertheless, there are several interesting parallels between Smith's project in religious studies and Latour's in science studies, as well as in the way their work was/is received. Cantwell Smith's project is well known in religious studies. Like Latour he develops a new vocabulary to talk about human beings in a different way; in his case a vocabulary with strong religious and moral over tones. Whereas Latour looks for a non-modern anthropology that does away with the opposition of pre-modern versus modern, Smith searches for a non-secular human science that does away with the opposition between religious and secular. (See Smith 1994) His argument against dichotomies such as the subjective versus the objective shows many par allels with Latour's work. This heresy [the fallacy of the objective/subjective dualism] has gone far to divide up our world into lonely individualisms on the one hand and impersonal objects on the other—the kind of world in which modern sec ular culture has forced a distressingly large number of moderns to live. Much of what is fundamental to human life is omitted from this desper ately narrow theory, this mistaken categorizing. ... To be victim of some notion that the only alternative to an objective view of anything is a sub jective view, is grossly to misunderstand humankind. It drastically falsifies what it means for us to be persons. ... to fall into objective-subjective dualism is to accept a less close approximation to the truth, not only of ourselves and our fellow human beings but also of the world around us, which we are trying to understand, than could be ours. Both objectivity and subjectivity are derivative, almost arbitrarily from a prior and far richer reality. The relation between each of us and the rest of us, and the rest of the envi</page><page sequence="17">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 353 ronment, is not secondary but constitutive. (By appropriating this truth inwardly we do not diminish our own individual quality but greatly enhance it. Nor do we diminish our capacity for science, but significantly supplement it, or indeed enlarge it.) (Smith 1993: 221-222, italics added) In 1979-1980 a brief exchange went on between Don Wiebe and Cantwell Smith on the role of belief in religious studies. For Smith Wiebe's evaluation of his work (1979) is so massive a misunderstand ing that he wonders how, or even whether, to reply. The discussion is seen as an example of a radical failure of communication because his new way of envisioning the subject is assessed by Wiebe within the confines of the old "paradigm" proving only that "there it does not nicely fit." (Smith 1980: 247) The magnitude of Smith's proposal is rec ognized as Wiebe claims that it is extremely important to respond, "for the call to move beyond 'belief' amounts to a 'call' for a revolution in the study of religion." (Wiebe 1979: 234) For Wiebe, Smith's proposal regarding belief, of which he nevertheless comes to appreciate certain elements over time,4 is radical and would be costly. (Wiebe, 1979: 235) The fear, well founded in Cantwell Smith's case as I shall point out, that such a move ends up in the "re-theologisation" of the study of religion, turns Wiebe into a campaigner for "belief" as an analytical category. Like Latour, however, Smith's work is seen as a case of "con standy springing from one position to another," then denying a role for belief, then again using such terms as belief system, the intellectual side of faith etc. (See Wiebe 1992: 49-50, 56-7) It is my argument that like Latour, though with his feet in a different field, Smith attempted a move beyond the centrality of belief. As Kenneth Cracknell has noted, Smith throughout his career has been in search for theoretical clarity about the relative unimportance of "belief" in relation to what he referred to as "faith". (Cracknell 2001: 5) Smith himself points out that he does not "in fact attempt to dissuade scholars from using the con cept; only from using it unselfcritically, and/or ambiguously, and from making it central in religious interpretation, and especially from imag ining it anachronistically central as a concept for religious persons' self interpretation." (Smith 1980: 254) In my opinion a fruitful collaboration between science studies and religious studies in "going beyond the cen trality of belief(s)" is possible here. Nevertheless, in the last part of this article I will argue that Wiebe's plea for a scientific study of religion 4 Whereas Wiebe at first claims that the notion of belief is a central religious category, he later on agrees with Smith that it is not a religious, but a social notion. They strongly differ, however, about the implications of this assertion.</page><page sequence="18">354 LIE VE ORYE needs to be taken seriously. His notion of "the irony of theology" and his plea for a study of religion in which a clear line is drawn between subject matter and discipline keep their value in a non-modern world. The irony of theology and. a translation "beyond the centrality of belief" "A Failure of Nerve in the Academic Study of Religion", an article written by Wiebe in 1984, has evoked much reaction. However, Wiebe doubted whether the intent of the essay to draw attention to the pos sibility of a fundamental contradiction in the practice of Religious Studies was really appreciated. (Wiebe 1986: 197) It made him once more argue that the study of religion has to become fully "academically naturalized" and "detheologized" aiming at "public knowledge of public facts," by following the rules that govern such public discourse about public facts. (Wiebe 1985: 83,84; 1986: 199) However, the feeling might have con tributed to a major shift in his work. The absence of "appreciable gains" in his search for a compatibility system between religion and science forced him to take a look at the project and its underlying assumptions. He comes to realise that the search rests on "a rather significant, but as yet unrecognized, assumption. ... I was, that is, identifying theology with religion. To put the matter a little less star tlingly, I had been assuming that 'theology' and 'religious thought' were essentially indistinguishable and, therefore, that a harmony between sci ence and theology implied a harmony of science and religion." (Wiebe 1994: xi) Wiebe takes a closer look at the "role" and "relation" of theology in or to religious thought. Getting inspiration from Lévi-Bruhl, a story is told in The Irony of Theology ( 1991 a) in which two modes of thought, the mythopoeic and the scientific, figure centrally; two moments, the emergence of philosophy in ancient Greece and the moment of an axial shift in the twelfth century are the central events. Through the story, the ambiguous character of theology is disclosed, and it is shown to arise because there is something deeply ironical about theology understood as rational religion or as a process of rationalizing religion. To put it bluntly, it can be shown that, even though theology appears to emerge from within the matrix of religion and in aid and support of religion, it is in fact detri mental to religion and the religious form of life because its primary inten tion is at odds with fundamental religious aspirations. (Wiebe 1991a: 7) Mythopoeic or religious thinking and theological/scientific thinking appear as mutually exclusive. Wiebe tells the tale in terms of beliefs</page><page sequence="19">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 355 and believing and claims that with the rise of philosophic/scientific thought a differentiation in "believing" also emerges. That is, whereas in mythopoeic thought beliefs are present, these function "more as a social bond amongst the members of the group rather than merely to supply the group with knowledge" (Wiebe 1991a: 214). Such thought can be characterized as "local knowledge", simultaneously descriptive/ explanatory and evaluative/identificatory. Scientific thought on the other hand is only descriptive/explanatory and to be characterized as "translo cal knowledge". That is, the desire of "knowledge for the sake of knowl edge" introduced "a spirit of critical reflectiveness that refuses to recognize extracritical attempts to contain it and so, implicitly, transcends the tra dition that espouses it." (Wiebe 1991a: 13) As early as 1987 Wiebe reflects on the implications of Lévy-Bruhl's views of a radical difference between mythopoeic and scientific think ing.5 For the study of religion he concludes: Consequently, if "religious thinking" (archaic, ancient, modern or con temporary), conforms to the mythopoeic pattern rather than to that of sci ence, the only academically respectable knowledge about religion will be that gained via the social sciences and not via that received by revelation or gained through religious experience and teaching. A thorough under standing of Lévy-Bruhl, therefore, could setde, once and for all, the "tug of-war" between "insiders" and "outsiders" for methodological control of research on religion in our academic institutions. (Wiebe 1987: 29) Whereas in 1987, religious and theological thought are still seen as "all of a cloth", in 1991 a clear picture of the irony of theology appears. In attempting a rational defence of religion and therefore a knowledge about gods rather than religious knowledge, theology becomes detrimental to it. In searching to make sense of religion within the academic context, theology neglects the incommensurability in intent and runs into the incompatibilities in content. For Wiebe, things are clear. Traditional knowledge and scientific knowledge cannot be held together within one single coherent framework and attempts to forge such a compatibility only result in deforming and subordinating one or the other. (Wiebe 1993: 46) Moreover, a similar distortion is at work in attempts to intro duce religion's different intent, the provision of "meaning", into sci ence. For Wiebe, science is not concerned with meaning in a religious or mythopoeic sense. Rather, disenchantment is inherent to the very 5 A thorough study of anthropological and other literature is undertaken by Wiebe in defence of Lévi-Bruhl thesis, which is reformulated in the light of his findings.

Any attempt to re-enchant turns science into religion blurring once more the line between subject matter and discipline. Introducing Latour's symmetrical anthropology as a new starting point, Catherine Bell makes the important point that "Latour's initial symmetries promise to locate more effectively the relevant "asymme tries," that is, the differences that afford real comparisons—and some judgments—between science and other ways of knowing." (Bell 1996: 188) I fully agree with her that this is a crucial point, not only in debates about science, but also in studying science and human beings "on the ground". In Latour's non-modern world religion and science remain different practices, mutually exclusive, though no longer forming a dichotomy that fills up the whole picture. Whereas in Wiebe's story a mythopoeic mode of thinking, local and centring on meaningfulness, gave way to a non-local non-personal scientific mode of thinking, Latour tells a less encompassing, but similar story of a religious regime of enun ciation, centring on what he calls the creation of persons, that becomes superimposed by the scientific regime of enunciation, centring on the transfer of information through a chain of referentiality. Holbein's paint ing "The Ambassadors" (1533) is taken as an example to show the superimposition in the same picture of these antagonistic points of view, at a moment in history in which the balance is turning towards the age of representation and science. It is clear that in Latour's story as well both views are mutually exclusive. One cannot hold at the same time, and in the same relation, represen tation and re-presentation; one cannot be at the same time, and in the same relation, viewer and convert. Between new science and old religion, there is now an incompatibility of points of view. What is concealed from the eyes of one is revealed to the eyes of the other. What is presented by one is distanced by the other. What is formed and figured by one is deformed and disfigured by the other. (Latour 2001: 220) In my opinion, Latour's non-modern view on science and religion allows us to construct a similar argument for theology's irony and against blur ring the line between subject matter and discipline. However, the point to be made here lies elsewhere. I want to argue that the felt need to blur the line, to theologize or humanize science is a modernist need, felt when a discourse in terms of beliefs and representations abounds. The feeling that something is left out of the picture, something specifically human, something specifically religious, elicits attempts to humanize or even theologize science. It is however a response to a problem in human science that merely succeeds in reinforcing the underlying error. I suggest that thus far most solutions given are examples of "theology's irony,"</page><page sequence="21">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 357 distorting fundamentally the nature of the subject matter. In my opinion, Cantwell Smith realized the nature of this distortion when he argued against the use of religion as a reifying outsider term. Nevertheless, even though Smith realized an important source of distortion, Wiebe's criticisms are not without a foundation since he failed to appreciate the full consequences and got caught up in "a failure of nerve." 7. Cantwell Smith beyond the centrality of belief For Smith, the terms "belief' and "religion" as well as "religions" are secular outsider categories. These arise, he says, when one abstracts, depersonalizes, and reifies the various systems of other people of which one does not oneself see the meaning or appreciate the point, let alone accept the validity. [T]he practice of naming a religion and conceptualizing it systematically is appropriate primarily for outsiders, for those for whom it is not a medium of faith. (Smith 1978: 108) The participant can see very clearly that the outsider may know all about a religious system, and yet may totally miss the point. The outsider may intellectually command all the details of its external facts, and yet may be—indeed, as an outsider, presumably must be or demonstratively is—untouched by the heart of the matter. There is a difference between knowing a doctrine of salvation and being saved . . . To know 'a religion' is not yet to know the religious life of him whom one observes. (Smith 1978:134) For Smith religious life cannot be understood unless one understands that that life has necessarily and rightly looked different when viewed from within and viewed from without. (Smith 1978: 129) Unfortunately, for Smith this is reason enough to reject secular outsider terms and to resort to religious language to explain the difference between inside and outside as a difference between "having faith"—for which he takes great pains to distinguish it from "having beliefs"—and "being secular". Of the latter he writes, "[cjertainly my view is that this outlook, with its ontological, epistemological, moral, and personal implications is intel lectually in error." He see it as "seriously reductionist of reality, of value, of the process of rational learning, of the human; and seriously disruptive of community" and he concludes, "[fjundamentally, its fallacy stems from its loss of faith." (Smith 1994: 181) For Smith being human equals having faith and it is the latter word, as well as his frequent reference to the transcendent that for many makes his work, rightfully, hard to deal with. For Smith, however, this religious language seems to be the only one available to think about the insider-outsider issue without assuming the centrality of belief. Although it is impossible to</page><page sequence="22">358 LIEVE ORYE make a case for it here, in my opinion Smith, using religious insider language, attempts to capture the insider's experience of enskilment. In non-modern perspectives on the world, developed by scholars like Bruno Latour and Tim Ingold, a view of learning in terms of enskilment rather than receiving a set of beliefs comes to the surface: It is through a process of enskilment, not enculturation, that every gen eration grows into and beyond the wisdom of its predecessors. This leads me to conclude that in the growth of human knowledge, the contribution that each generation makes to the next is not an accumulated stock of representations but an education of attention. (Ingold 2001: 114) In the passage of human generations, each one contributes to the knowl edgeability of the next not by handing down a corpus of disembodied, context-free information or beliefs, but by setting up, through their activ ities, the environmental contexts within which successors develop their own embodied skills of perception and action. (Ingold 2001: 143) In light of such a view, Smith's statement that the various religious sys tems of the world are not fancy elaborations tacked on to human his tory as curiosities over and above the standard human, but rather, the principal attempts at being human, as well as his statement that a per son is not first a human being and then also a Jew, or also a Christian, or a Muslim but is a human being by being one or other of them (Smith 1979: 138) might be understood in non-religious terms and become available for further scientific reflection. However, the latter is only an option if Wiebe's warnings and criticisms of Cantwell Smith are taken seriously. 8. The irony of translating into "beliefs" In 1992 Wiebe writes a sequel to "The role of belief in the study of religion" (1979). This time he acknowledges Smith's "major empirical discovery". This discovery... is more than a simple discovery of the change of mean ing in the use of the word "belief". To put it in a nutshell, his discovery is that in the traditions he has examined religious persons did not ask anyone to believe anything; that is, that believing, in the modern sense of the term, was not a central religious category. . . until recent times, no one affirmed that it was religiously important to hold certain beliefs. (Wiebe 1992: 51) He takes issue, however, with the conclusions Smith draws from that discovery for the study of religion. It seems, writes Wiebe, that "the new way of looking at the religious life would require eschewing the</page><page sequence="23">RE APPROPRIATING 'RELIGION? 359 use of any and all concepts foreign to the discourse of the religious community because the concepts that are central to the scientific search for explanations and theories seem necessarily to stand at odds with the role of the central concepts in religious discourse." (Wiebe 1992: 51) The assumption underlying this requirement is that all concepts used in the study of religion must be religious concepts and hence, the out sider perspective is rejected. Wiebe takes Smith's objection to the mod ern concept of belief as symbolic for his rejection of any social-scientific approach to understanding human life. He places him resolutely into the humanistic camp, guilty of espousing a form of idealist metaphysics that exempts meaningful action from nature and therefore from causal analysis, hiding behind a cognitively incoherent principle of charity and indulging in an anthropomorphism that involves a "collective privileged access theory" of culture. (Wiebe 1992: 54-56) In my opinion, however, this is a good example of understanding Smith within the confines of the old paradigm. An idealist philosophy is not what one finds in Cantwell Smith's work. On the contrary, he—and Latour as well—is highly critical of such idealist and subjectivist views on human beings and sees them as still caught up in the secularist framework that trans lates religion into belief. Attempting a translation of Smith's view in non-religious terms, one might see the error involved in humanizing the human sciences as just another elaborate reinforcement of the modernist framework. Briefly, in a modernist world in which beliefs and representations figure cen trally, scientific knowledge, seen in itself without any attention for the practices of science, can be taken as the standard with which all other kinds of beliefs and representations could be compared (and found want ing). However, this comparison comes at a cost, irony is involved. In attempting to give a voice within science to "other kinds of knowl edge," one fundamentally distorts "ways of life," "ways of learning," "processes of enskilment" etc. One assumes that the only knowledge human beings gain in this world is a knowledge that can stand on itself in an explicit form and next to other bodies of knowledge to be com pared with. Such a view denies humans a direct engagement with their surrounding world. It denies the possibility of learning results that are not in themselves transmittable as packages of beliefs or statements from one person to another, or it relegates this possibility to the safe level of the body, safeguarding the mind from such a confusing reality with a dualism-slash and a kept-out-of-sight translation into beliefs. Finally, it denies what Latour shows in his work, the specific human work done in direct engagement with the world to arrive at what is very specific</page><page sequence="24">360 LIE VE ORYE and not at all superabundant, that is, stabilized facts and "knowledge beyond culture and morality." 9. Smith's failure of nerve Nevertheless, though not sharing the humanist view on the subject mat ter, Smith is still a humanist in a different way. That is, in "going beyond the centrality of belier' he does not arrive at a fully symmet rical anthropology, but draws a line around "us, human beings", as fundamentally different from animals and non-humans. It allows him to recuperate his different hypothesis in a kind of theological-historical narrative in which the record will be set straight again and humans will finally enter in a colloquium in which "we all talk (learn) together about ourselves." The asymmetry, the singling out of human beings, is in my opinion caused by interference from moral/theological motives, and allows for the easy transition from history to theology in his work. That is, the interference leads to religious language use and to a prescription of his view on humane learning as a methodology for the human sci ences. In other words, he as well attempts to get the insider experience in science, rather than scientifically mapping out a non-modern per spective on human beings and their processes of enskilment. As Wiebe rightfully noted, Smith suffers a "failure of nerve"; that is, he as well feels the modernist need to somehow bridge the insider and outsider position and succeeds in making his alternative hypothesis scientifically inadequate. The fact that the insider experience is different from the outsider's does not imply that "insider knowledge" or "insider beliefs and meanings" should be introduced in science and given a safeguarded status. As Cantwell Smith points out, a translation of the insider experience into a language of beliefs might fundamentally distort it. However, it also does not imply that a different hypothesis connecting the insiders' expe rience to their engagement with a tradition and to processes of learn ing/enskilment through tradition, should be prescribed for human science. This manoeuvre also only makes sense within the confines of the mod ernist framework in which certain assumptions about science and about the role of belief and knowledge in individual life and in social life are upheld. That is, whereas Cantwell Smith goes a few steps beyond the centrality of beliefs in his reconceptualisation of the subject matter, moral/theological motives not only limit him strongly in that endeav our, but pull him back within the confines of the modernist framework. It keeps him from studying thoroughly the role of beliefs and knowl</page><page sequence="25">REAPPROPRIATING 'RELIGION'? 361 edge in a non-modern world. If however human beings learn through engagement with a tradition, becoming enskilled rather than piling up beliefs in a mind-vat, and therefore learn while doing instead of learn ing before doing, it seems to me that the role of belief, of science and scientific knowledge is quite different from what the modernists have in mind and, at least to me, the modernist need to bridge the insider and outsider positions seems to disappear. In other words, it seems to me that in a fully worked out non-modern perspective, of which we have only an inkling in religious studies through Cantwell Smith's work and something more that than in Latour's work, Wiebe's statement that the study of religion is a matter of understanding and explaining an activity rather than to be involved in it, will only raise consent. 10. Conclusions The work of Cantwell Smith is interesting not only in its deconstructive aspect that has inspired many, but also in his attempt to work out an alternative. The similarities with Latour's work invite us to join the exploration and construction of a symmetrical anthropology having our feet in the field of religion. With Wiebe I agree that "religion" is to be expropriated from the humanists/theologians and like him I consider "the role of beliefs" a central issue in religious studies. As he writes in his more recent article on Smith's work, extensive discussion is needed to provide a greater clarification of the issues involved. Wiebe had hoped that others would enter the debate after his exchange with Cantwell Smith in 1979-1980, but saw his expectations for the most part unfulfilled. (Wiebe 1992: 48) I hope that with this contribution in which, through the work of Latour, an appeal is made to take a non modern perspective on the matter, ample questions emerge and that the debate on the role of belief and the concept of religion can be resumed in a study of religion without a distorting interference from extra-scientific goals and with a clear line between subject matter and discipline.6 Postdoctoral Fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research—Flanders (Belgium) Ghent University 6 The second part of Radical Interpretation in Religion (2002), especially the article by Catherine Bell, can be seen as another attempt to revive this debate.</page><page sequence="26">362 LIEVE ORYE References Bell, Catherine (1996).
