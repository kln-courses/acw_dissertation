<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRADITION IN THE TOPSY-TURVY WORLD OF PARODY: ANALYSIS OF TWO OBERIU PLAYS Anatoly Vishevsky, Washington University, St. Louis The oberiuty aimed at creating their own world of literary reality, different from and contrasting to that of preceding literary traditions.' But before creating the new world, they had to "destroy" the old one. The weapon they chose for this purpose was literary parody.2 Two plays-Minin i Poffarskij (1926) by Aleksandr Vvedenskij and Komedija goroda Peterburga (1927) by Daniil Xarms-demonstrate well how parody was employed as a means of rejecting concrete Russian literary forms, styles, and traditions.3 For the oberiuty a theatrical piece was not necessarily a play with a dis- tinct plot, staged according to strict rules of direction. Instead, theatre is everything unusual, strange, and different that can arouse the audience's interest and curiosity. Their understanding of theatre is actually close to the practice of the Russian medieval folk theater balagan, or puppet show, with its Petrulka hero. The task of theatre was not to provide a "mirror" image of reality: That is not at all what the theatre is. If an actor who represents a minister begins to move around on the stage on all fours and howls like a wolf, or an actor who represents a Russian peasant suddenly delivers a long speech in Latin-that will be theatre. (Gibian, 201) The obbriuty held that theatre had its own logic and laws, which did not coincide with the logic and laws of life. That is why, according to them, dramatic plot did not have to develop in a logical sequence. The narration of their own plays is constantly interrupted by incidental monologues or scenes that do not "make sense" in the conventional way. Both Minin i Poffarskij and Komedija goroda Peterburga are absurd, and both have universal scope. However, they are not international, which dis- tinguishes them from the tradition of the Western European "theatre of the absurd." They are based on Russian literature; parodying the traditions, styles, and forms of this literature by numerous allusions and references, they are locked inside it. It is as if the oberiuty Vvedenskij and Xarms took literally the anti-literary purposefulness4 and struggle against the old literary SEEJ, Vol. 30, No. 3 (1986) 355</page><page sequence="2">356 Slavic and East European Journal traditions characteristic of the Western "theatre of the absurd," although in fact they were unfamiliar with the phenomenon. They chose references to and lines from various classics of Russian literature and, by placing them in unconventional surroundings, sought to destroy their accepted images. Such surroundings provide ostranenie, which topples the idol and makes the reader look at familiar images, characters, and lines from a different point of view. The title Minin i Polzarskij might well suggest a historical drama. To rein- force the image of "historic reality," Vvedenskij actually fills the play with the names of historical figures. But they are all taken from different times and places. In this way the writer destroys the notion of time: the Roman emperor Nero talks to a tsarist Russian officer (praporsiik); the medieval Russian prince Monomax acts side by side with the eighteenth-century Rus- sian empress Catherine; General Ermolov of the Napoleonic wars appears as a friend of Prince Men'gikov, the most powerful collaborator of Peter the Great ("Ermolov byl knjazja Men'gikova drug" [Vvedenskij, 14]); Prince Kurbskij, who fled to Poland during the reign of Ivan the Terrible, coexists with Count Sermet'ev, one of Catherine's courtiers. At the same time we find mention of different nations, which at different times were at war with Russia-the Poles, the English, the Swedes, the Turks (ironically called "tureckij brat"). The absence of a particular place, the confusion of times, epochs, and historical figures aim at transforming the perception of history as objective reality. The lines given to characters with the names of historical figures have nothing to do with their historical identities. The words they pronounce are absurd and funny, and they appear even more so when we keep in mind who is speaking. Historical allusions are numerous, but it is the literary references which make a fascinating object of study. Boris Godunov is the character from Pugkin's historical play rather than a tsar. Pugkin is frequently referred to, but, of course, in an absurd context ("O Pugkin, Pugkin" [Vvedenskij, 7]; "tot Pugkin byl bez golovy" [Vvedenskij, 8]; "na eto Pugkin otveial" [Vve- denskij, 9]). An allusion is made to Pugkin's fairy tales: "gasnet sveika i Ruslana / petugkom v trave lelit" (Vvedenskij, 13). One can easily connect the first line with the scene of Ljudmila's capture by the sorcerer ternomor in "Ruslan i Ljudmila." In the fairy tale the event is also accompanied by the extinguishing of a candle. Only the name of the heroine appears here as the feminized name of the hero-Ruslan. The second line could be associated with another of Pugkin's fairy tales, "Zolotoj petugok." And again the twist occurs: it is the tsar who falls down, killed by the rooster. The distortion of the name in the first line and the inversion of the facts in the second aim at a humorous effect, destroying the image of Pu'kin's fairy tales. The play contains many clear references to Gogol'. Nuns remark to a certain Nencov: "Kak 6uden Dnepr pri tixoj pogode, tak ty Nencov zdes'</page><page sequence="3">The Topsy-Turvy World of Parody 357 zabem" (Vvedenskij, 6). A beautiful lyrical line from the description of the Dnieper in Gogol"s story "Stragnaja mest'" is combined here with an awk- ward tag-question. Both are put into a cause-effect relationship by the words "Kak ... tak." The full technique of the absurdists can be seen and under- stood from this example. Comparing logically incomparable things, break- ing the cause-effect relationship, the obWriuty destroy traditional common- sense logic. Using allusions to literature as the members of their absurd paradigms, on the other hand, they destroy the conventional images asso- ciated with particular literary works of the past. Another reference to Gogol' is connected with the novel Taras Bul'ba. In Polarskij's last monologue, pronounced from the top of a wardrobe,5 we find the following lines: H noniK CMHpeHHbIi o3sIpaeT OH Ha yTece nIOKOBOM HOA HHM KyCTbI CTOHT CapaToB B cBOM Oe6MaHqHBOM HORIKy OTeI! MyHInTyK! ICpHIaT Tapacy (Vvedenskij, 20) The words polk, utes, otec, munituk, and, of course, the name of the hero allude to the picture of Taras's burning on a cliff, whereas the place men- tioned ("stoit Saratov") as well as the immediate lines preceding and follow- ing the passage destroy this image and take us back to the absurd world of the play. At one point half a page is given exclusively to three characters from Revizor-Xlestakov, Gorodnitij, and Mar'ja Antonovna, who carries a flute. They sit on a Ural hill ("ural'skaja gorka"), having an absurd conversation. After using them in this scene, the author never mentions them again, which suggests that we have been given a variant of the famous Revizor, rewritten by an absurdist author. Alongside references to particular writers and their works, we find allu- sions to different genres. This relates to obdriuty ideas about theatre as a synchronizing art. In Minin i Pokarski] and even more so in Komedija goroda Peterburga, the authors mix up, as in a tossed salad, pieces of ballads, folk songs, eastulki, Ancient Greek tragedy, march songs, legends, Russian bala- gan, and modern poetry. We recognize the various genres through form (rhythm, structure): the context is absurd. For example, in Minin i Pokarskij Plebejkin has the following lines: Po6ecnbep Po6ecnbep KaTeHbKa H Bce lpoqee TaKOe CaM noiieT (Vvedenskij, 9) These lines apparently are supposed to be sung to the tune of a well-known military march:</page><page sequence="4">358 Slavic and East European Journal ConosBei conOBsei HlTameMKa KaHapeeMKa )Kano6Ho IIOCT. Or, in another example: BbImr a iKon6o09Ka 6ea cypHK BOCK H rie6fea nyTHHK rOpHHMHbIMi ropmOK SBoeHHbIi HOpomIOK (Vvedenskij, 13) The lines are similar to children's rhymes used in games (scitalki). In this case the author does not have to "make" the verse absurd-the children do it themselves.6 What Vvedenskij does in mixing different genres and juxtaposing various absurd texts can be illustrated by a simple example. One of the characters pronounces a line, "S volkami fit', rot ne razevaj" (Vvedenskij, 17). Com- bining parts of two perfectly "normal" proverbs, "S volkami fit', po volE'i vyt"' (When you live among wolves, you howl like one) and "Na Eu'oj karavaj rot ne razevaj" (Don't try to take a bite out of someone else's pie), Vvedenskij creates an absurd, humorous effect. In the same way, on a larger scale, the same effect is achieved in the play as a whole. Different genres, styles, and names, perfectly "normal" when used by themselves, turn into parts of an absurd whole when tossed together. Minin i Polarskij was written in 1926, and Xarms, Vvedenskij's best friend and literary companion, was surely the first to read it. It was proba- bly part of the impetus for Xarms's Komedija goroda Peterburga, written in September 1927. This view is supported by various direct references to Vve- denskij's play in Komedija goroda Peterburga. Like Vvedenskij, Xarms makes several references to Germans. Like Vvedenskij, Xarms uses the attribute "pale" (blednyj) when referring to Petersburg. Vvedenskij several times employs the name Katja, Katen'ka, Ekaterina; it appears as well in Xarms's play. The only difference is that in Minin i Polarskij the name is used at random and without any connection to a person. In Komedija go- roda Peterburga, on the other hand, Katja has a character. We know that she is a simple young girl, who is fond of nice clothes and behaves frivo- lously. She also likes Komsomolec Vertuxov. Unlike Vvedenskij's play, Xarms's Komedija goroda Peterburga has characters who do exist, though they act and speak absurdly. Like Vvedenskij's play, Komedija goroda Peterburga contains numerous folkloric and pseudo-folkloric passages (in the form of castu'ki, balagan-like dialogues, children's talk, folk songs, and byliny). However they are not of</page><page sequence="5">The Topsy-Turvy World of Parody 359 primary importance, but function to create a fascinating scenic ambience. Literary references are more numerous and more important. The allusions are clear, more extended, and more easily recognizable than in Vvedenskij. They serve to distort the image of a literary hero or work known to the reader. Occasionally characters in the play, named after well-known char- acters from Russian literature (e.g., Famusov), have no connection with the names they carry. More frequently, however, we come across the opposite phenomenon-a character whose name is meaningless to the reader, but who bears some features of a well-known literary hero. For example, Prince Meserskij becomes a reference to Prince Myikin of Dostoevskij's Idiot:' Prince Mescerskij lives in Switzerland, and comes to Russia by airplane. People refer to him as a "wise one," consult him, seek his advice. To make sure that the audience knows whom he means, Xarms provides Mescerskij with features directly opposite to those characteristic of My'kin. He has come to Petersburg to find and punish the abuser, who called him a scoundrel ("merzavcem menja svetlejsego nazval"). He is rude, physically strong, and healthy: Bcex pa3o6bmo OAHOHi PYKOro H K qepTosBOi MaTepH nomrno... ja TbI-TO 3HaeCb BOT 3TH pyKH rHyT rXITaK! (Xarms, 96) He is said to breed canaries ("razvodit kanareek" [Xarms, 91]), one of the characteristic low-taste features of petty bourgeois life. At the end of the play, in order to confirm the reader's guess that he has just met Myikin, the author gives us a clear indication of the origin of the character. Nikolaj II says, addressing Prince Mescerskij: "A ty leti k sebe v Svejcariju / tam lu0e. / Ujdi ot solnca, skrojsja ot ljudej" (Xarms, 102). As in Minin i Polarskij, in Komedija goroda Peterburga we find an allusion to Pugkin's fairy tale, "Skazka o care Saltane." The words of Nikolaj II, "carica rodit mne syna krepkogo kak buk" (Xarms, 85), are a clear parody of the well-known line: "i rodi bogatyrja mne k isxodu sentjabrja" (Puvkin, 1:176). The words of the dethroned emperor sound ironic and funny against those of his fairy tale counterpart. Another allusion to Pu'kin is: "Likuj 'erke'enka! Sverkaet" (Xarms, 108). The nationality (Circassian), exclamatory sentences-a feature of the ro- mantic tradition-and the word "to glisten"8 point to Pugkin's narrative poem Kavkazskij plennik. The frequent mention of a bird9 (in connection with the heroine, Marija, and death) in the Xarms play, as well as the following lines, likely allude to iexov's Cajka: "Marija kak-to uvidela pticu / i govorit: Kirill Davydovi6 / ubej na pamjat'!" (Xarms, 105).10 Unlike "common" Katja, Marija is present in romantically colored passages. She is usually associated with the chase, horses, piano, suicides, and daggers:</page><page sequence="6">360 Slavic and East European Journal ...

KHPHJInn asBbIJbIq - MbI CBO60oHbI!&gt;&gt; (Xarms, 92) On the one hand, the girl's name and several lines alluding to God, to whom she gave her soul, suggest a connection with the Virgin Mary. The line "Marija bogu dugu otdala" (Xarms, 113) has a humorous coloring because the expression Bogu dulu otdat' means 'to die, to pass away'. It is also ironic, for the name of the god-Obernibesov-contains bes 'demon'. Both romantic and biblical images of Marija contrast with some elements in her speech which are characteristic of the colloquial language (such as calling Obernibesov Kira). As opposed to Vvedenskij's play, where literary allusions are given only as labels, in Komedija goroda Peterburga these references are fully developed and so extended that they create a wide-scale panorama of literary themes and traditions in Russian literature. But this panorama is seen through the skewed mirror of the absurd. In the playful and cheerful manner of the 1920s, Xarms attacks and parodies the literary traditions of previous centu- ries, as well as contemporary ones. The following are just several examples: "A vot i P'janica i dama / i my s toboj i vsja zemlja!" (Xarms, 112). The allusion here is to Blok's "Neznakomka," where the lady (another manifes- tation of Prekrasnaja Dama) is contrasted to the brutal people surrounding her ("p'janicy s glazami krolikov" [Blok, 185]). The obvious parody of the symbolist poem is achieved simply through capitalization. The word "lady" is not capitalized, while the word "drunkard" is. The language of the so- called Prekrasnaja Dama is characterized by the idiom of a lady of easy virtue of the NAP period: laMa - Q~y KaKHe rJIynocTH roBopHTe! IHbIHHLa - 3TO eMy Harie nOBCeAeHHC He HeHpaBHTcR. )laMa - Camria, Mep3aBeu! He XBaTafi MeHR... IHbsHHLa - HOgJ~OcH c no~o)xOH c. .. laMa - HensR, He xoy. /OT6HBaeTcs. IbSlHHIa LenIyeT ee/. (Xarms, 112-13) Sometimes one line is enough to create an allusion to a certain literary tradition. For example: "I ne Zardar pr pr" (Xarms, 107). This line achieves</page><page sequence="7">The Topsy-Turvy World of Parody 361 two goals: it makes a clear parody of a well-known verse of the futurist Krudenyx ("Dyr bur MEil" [Krudenyx, 531]), and at the same time represents a love confession, expressing the intimate feelings and emotions of the character. In fact, there is more meaning (in the conventional sense of the word) in the line of Xarms, than that of Krudenyx. Zardar reminds us of landarm, pr pr-an abbreviation meaning 'et cetera'. Xarms often uses paraphrases of famous lines, but does so in such a way that besides being allusions, they are perceived by the reader as parody: "Nu ladno! pro6' iz htix mest. / Kakoj pozor! / Ja bol'ge tut ne budu povtorjat'sja" (Xarms, 106). These lines, pronounced by Prince Melterskij when he boards the plane ready to leave for Switzerland, are an ironic allusion to tackij's monologue from Griboedov's Gore ot uma: "Von iz Moskvy! Sjuda ja bol'ge ne ezdok. / Begu, ne ogljanus', pojdu iskat' po svetu" (Griboedov, 199). The same technique is used by the author when he creates a parody of Lermontov's short narrative poem "Borodino." Several words and expres- sions characteristic of Lermontov's work, thrown into the absurd mono- logues pronounced by Komsomolec Vertuxov, create a humorous effect: A nHOMHHIxIb eHb. .. S4paHTysc3.as myMena peb. .. Mocia nparoM 6bIna cnaneHa TbI HOMHHIIIb 3To? (Xarms, 90) Compare this to Lermontov's: - CKacH-Kia, ~IARA, BCb HegapoM MoCKBa, craneHHaR nox oapoM, ( paH~y3y oT~aHa?... HegapoM rIOMHHT BCs PoccHR rIpo geHb BopOIHHa! (26) In another reference to Lermontov" we have: "dalekij parus v 6udnom more" (Xarms, 85), referring to the poet's lyrical poem "Parus": "Beleet parus odinokoj / V tumane morja golubom! ... / to iMiet on v strane dalekoj?" (Lermontov, 449). The attribute dalekij is transferred from the word strana in Lermontov's poem to the word parus in the play, which gives the parody an additional humorous effect. The image of a sail appears at the end of the play, where Marija describes her journey across the sea, bringing back the reference to Lermontov's poem. Besides references to individual writers and literary currents, in Komedija goroda Peterburga we find examples of parody of particular Russian literary traditions, such as the Petersburg tradition, for example. Nineteenth-century writers connected the name of the city with stories about madness and nightmares (Pulkin), devils (Gogol'), crime (Dostoevskij) and decay (Belyj). The Slavophiles associated the city with the hated West, and the Western-</page><page sequence="8">362 Slavic and East European Journal izers did not like it for its damp climate and excessive austerity. For a Russian author wishing to write a tragedy or a drama with mystics and the supernatural, the ideal place would be Petersburg. That is why the title of Xarms's play Komedija goroda Peterburga'2 is absurd in itself, already a parody of a particular literary tradition.'3 Hardly anything connected with the Petersburg tradition in Russian literature escapes Xarms's creative imagination. The motif of contrasting Petersburg to Moscow, so popular among the Slavophiles, as well as other Russian writers (Tolstoj included), finds its reflection in the play. Petersburg is called "pale" (blednyj [Xarms, 87]) and Moscow--"sumptuous" (pygnaja [Xarms, 89]). Consider how a certain 96epkin describes his trip to Moscow: "Pribelal tuda a tam vse tak le kak i u nas. Takie le doma i ljudi. Govorjat tol'ko naoborot. 'Zdravstvujte'--to zna6it u nix 'prol6ajte'" (Xarms, 99). At the beginning of the play, words and phrases like "Neva gumela v more," "Velikij car'," "togda ja gorod vystroil," "skazal stolica budet tut,"14 "dremu6ij les byl do kornja ostrilen" (Xarms, 85), and others create a clear allusion to Pugkin's Mednyj vsadnik. The monologue is pronounced by Petr, who, unlike the characters of Vvedenskij's play, corresponds to the name he carries. The effect of the absurd is achieved by awkward paraphrases of the well-known lines, as well as by juxtaposing "normal" words in abnormal situations: "I gumnye karety 6asto bili v okna xilin" (Xarms, 85).15 In the play Petr is contrasted with Nikolaj II, who in addition to being absurd also appears ridiculously funny. From the first page of the play Xarms makes clear whom he means when he uses the name Petr. This is not the great emperor or even his spirit, but the monument-Mednyj vsad- nik. Nikolaj II constantly calls him "pamajtnik besbuvstvennyj" (insensitive monument) and complains that he is being haunted by the monument: "brolu li ja u xrama 1' u dvorca 1' / mne vse mereffitsja skakun na kamne dikom" (Xarms, 85).16 The monument to Peter the Great appears in two major works of Russian literature: Pugkin's Mednyj vsadnik and Belyj's Peterburg. The reference to the latter can be found in the character of Obernibesov. Like Nikolaj Ableuxov, Obernibesov is shown several times on a bridge: "von tam gagaet po mostu" (Xarms, 101); "puskaj ?agaet po mostu Obernibesov" (Xarms, 102); "Obernibesov i storol na mostu" (Xarms, 103). But the allusion created by the author is destroyed at the end of the play by a twist. Accord- ing to Belyj's novel the monument chases Nikolaj Ableuxov, as it chased Evgenij in Pugkin's Mednyj vsadnik. Nevertheless in the play the monument becomes the one pursued, and Obernibesov follows him with an axe in hand: "Petr - (belit) / Obernibesov (belit za Petrom) - / Aga! ja Bog no s toporom!" (Xarms, 106). Another major Russian literary tradition dealt with in the play is the theme of the "superfluous man." It is combined with the newborn tradi-</page><page sequence="9">The Topsy-Turvy World of Parody 363 tion-the theme of the new, active revolutionary man. Both of them are reflected in the dialogue of two officers and both are parodied: I og4umep -- / 51/ cpeua )HTeCiCKHX BonH cTan xopomuf s3eMneMep H pa6oTalO KaK BOn. )KH3Hb nosHaX Tpyga MHe npHXITHa H MHJIa TaK H TbI HAH Tyga Kya Bcex pesBOJwauHR npHBena.

(Xarms, 111) Mysterious Petja Pirogov is a reference to the type of the superfluous man in Russian literature, whereas the name itself is a source of irony-it belongs to porurik Pirogov, Gogol"s polljak in "Nevskij Prospekt." Sometimes Xarms's parody borders on a street joke, as in the line, "Mne ne skuino / no nekogo udarit' po zubam" (Xarms, 106), a clear reference to a well-known line from Lermontov: "I skuino i grustno, i nekomu ruku podat"' (Lermontov, 67). The same street variant of Lermontov's poem is still used by young people in the Soviet Union. In the play Obernibesov has a second last name-Trexetalnyj, an attribute associated in the mind of a Russian with the word mat (obscenity). Sometimes Xarms's parody borders on acerbic commentary about the political authorities. The writer had to be quite bold to give a character (even ironically) the line "ja tvoj bog i car' i vlastelin" (Xarms, 85) at the time when the whole country was singing enthusiastically the key words of the solemn "International": "Nikto ne dast nam izbavlen'ja, / Ni bog, ni car' i ne geroj." Jokes like these and the generally ironic and playful manner of approach- ing the "deadly serious" life of the first five-year plan brought to life the article "Reakcionnoe longlerstvo (ob odnoj vylazke literaturnyx xuliganov)," which appeared on 9 April 1930 in the Leningrad newspaper Smena. The authorities could not understand or accept the world of irony created by the obbriuty-a world without authority. There is nothing and no one in this world sacred for the author-neither Peter the Great nor the "Bronze Horseman," neither Pugkin nor Komsomolec Vertuxov. Upon closer examination, however, one notices that the Petersburg of Xarms is not the "reality" of life. It is not even the world of literary reality. It is an "imaginary and artistically created world," a topsy-turvy world, where literature and reality (history) merge. The last tsar, Nikolaj II, talks with the "Bronze Horseman" and spits under a table on a bet; the biblical Virgin Mary and Marija-a romantic character from the nineteenth cen- tury-are combined into a petty bourgeois woman (mellanka). Prince</page><page sequence="10">364 Slavic and East European Journal Myikin breeds canaries. Pirogov becomes a superfluous man. The Prekras- naja Dama is belittled, and a drunkard revered. The Bronze Horseman turns from the hunter into the hunted. This is an anti-world, and it has its creator in the play-Obernibesov, who claims: "ja sozdal mir ... / ja poet" (Xarms, 104), "ja bog" (Xarms, 105). The name Obernibesov-the name of a landlord briefly mentioned in Remizov's story Povest' ob Ivane Stratilatove-is linked with the expression obernut'sja Lem-to (kem-to), typically used in describing supernatural trans- formations. Literally, the name Obernibesov can be read as 'turn-devil'. 'Turning' and 'twisting' have always been the main artistic principles for Xarms, as he himself said." The devil Obernibesov reigns in Leterburg- another name used for Petersburg in the play (Xarms, 121). Leta (Lethe in English) is the river of oblivion in Greek mythology, which allows us by analogy to call Petersburg "the city of oblivion." The idea of forgetfulness, applied to the framework of the literary symbolism surrounding the city in the play, carries also the meaning of death. Xarms is not alone in taking upon himself the role of coffin maker for the old world embodied in Petersburg. The same thing was done by Kon- stantin Vaginov, a friend of the oberiuty. In the introduction to his novel Kozlinaja pesn' we read: "Teper' net Peterburga. Est' Leningrad; no Lenin- grad nas ne kasaetsja-avtor po professii probovffik, a ne kolybel'nyx del master" (8).18 But by rejecting the literary tradition of the past, the obbriuty unintentionally followed the tradition of rejecting tradition, being "coffin makers"-as they said-which was started by Pugkin himself in his story "Grobovffik" from Povesti Belkina (Bethea and Davydov, 16-18). Ironically, Xarms pictures himself in the world created and ruled by his character Obernibesov. The two officers mentioned above seem to play another quite different part in the play. They play an April Fool's joke on the Komsomolec Vertuxov, telling him that he dropped something. The komsomolec does not understand the joke, and no matter how hard the officers try to convince him that they just played a harmless trick on him on the occasion of pleasant weather and April Fool's Day ("Potomu 6to kogda xorogaja pogoda ... Pervoe aprelja"), the komsomolec does not reply, but leaves in grim silence. The dialogue continues: I oQ(uep Buen?. II o4mgiep BHuen. Ceno ApsHb. OH IlOHUlI KTO MbI TaKHe.

If so, the question arises: Why did Xarms include himself</page><page sequence="11">The Topsy-Turvy World of Parody 365 and his friend in the passing and dying world of Petersburg, in the town of oblivion? Did he feel already in 1928 that the new world that had replaced the old one did not need them-the jokers; did Xarms predict his as well as his friend's future? (Both perished during Stalin's purges.) Was it a random stroke of the pen by a light-minded fop or a deep and self-ironic prophesy? Or perhaps even foreseeing his grim future, the writer could not resist including it in the absurd structure of the play, and in this way he parodied his own destiny and thereby conquered it. NOTES 1 Il'ja Levin writes of Leningrad of the 1930s, presented in the skewed mirror of the absurd in Xarm's stories, as an imaginary and artistically created world (271). 2 Tynjanov states: "[V]sjakaja literaturnaja preemstvennost' est' prelde vsego bor'ba, razru- genie starogo celogo i novaja strojka staryx elementov" (6). 3 Parody is a frequent element in the works of Xarms and Vvedenskij. Into the structure of their works they incorporated names of Russian writers and well-known literary charac- ters, lines from and allusions to famous works of literature. The two plays chosen for analysis best illustrate the way in which the obkriuty employed the device of parody in their works. The number of parodic elements in the two plays as well as the vast scope of literary and folkloric forms, genres, and traditions that the oberiuty treat suggest that especially in these plays parody is linked to a strong theoretical message, eminent in the creative oeuvre of the writers as a whole. 4 Martin Esslin writes: "The Theatre of the Absurd is ... part of the 'anti-literary' move- ment of our time, which has found its expression in abstract painting, with its rejection of 'literary' elements in pictures; or in the 'new novel' in France, with its reliance on the description of objects and its rejection of empathy and anthropomorphism" (19). 5 Wardrobe (platjanoj 9kaf) seems to play an important part in the lives and work of the obkriuty. It was the scenic center and a character, one may say, in their show Tri levyx Yasa, which took place on the stage of "Dom Pedati" on 24 January 1928 (Semenov, 180-81). In real life the wardrobe (probably the same one) was a dwelling place for Xarms's imaginary "auntie" (Elagin, 203-204). 6 Cf.: BbifIeJ MecCgq H3 TyMaHa, BbIHynJ HO)IKHK I3 KapMaHa: &lt;(Bygy pe3aTb, 6ygy 6HTb; Bce paBHO Te6e BOAH1Tb&gt;. (Sorokin, 97) 7 There may be a connection with Prince MeSgerskij, minor novelist, journalist, and close friend of careviY Nikolaj, the elder son and heir of Alexander II. Nikolaj's sudden death on the eve of his marriage was rumored to be a suicide over his reluctance to give up his affair with MeSgerskij (Karlinsky, 26). 8 The word and its synonyms are used rather frequently in the poem: "pylal v sijanii" (Pugkin, 2:294), "v sijanii luny" (296), "lunoju 6ut' ozarena" (296), "rog luny ... blesnet" (297), "v vence blistaja" (298), "gagki grozno blegiut" (301), "blestit pila" (307), "sverkali russkie gtyki" (309). 9 E.g.: "Oej ne vskineg'. I kak ptica / umreg' ot laskovoj ruki!" (Xarms, 92). 10 Cf.: "Nina: Pomnite, vy podstrelili 6ajku? Slubajno pri'el 6elovek, uvidel i ot neiego delat' pogubil" (iexov, 58). 11 The appearance of a treasurer's wife (kaznaeejfa) in the play can also be connected with Lermontov-the creator of the most famous kaznacejfa in Russian literature--Tambov-</page><page sequence="12">366 Slavic and East European Journal skaja kaznaeejfa. But this is merely a mention which, along with others of the same kind (e.g., Famusov), creates the literary atmosphere of the play. 12 The name of the play could also be inspired by the line from Vvedenskij's play: "byla uzasnaja komedija" (15). 13 See Tynjanov: "[P]arodiej tragedii budet komedija" (9). 14 Cf.: "Zdes' budet gorod zalo'en" (Pugkin, 2:465). 15 Cf.: "Serdito bilsja doid' v okno" (Pugkin, 2:468). 16 "Skakun na kamne dikom" is Xarms's variant of "Kumir na bronzovom kone" (Pugkin, 2:471). At the same time the first line of the two alludes to the beginning of Pugkin's famous poem "Brofu li ja vdol' ulic 'umnyx." 17 See Aleksandrov: "Veduscim princypom Daniila Xarmsa byl princyp alogi'nosti, 'obrat- nosti,' kak govoril sam pisatel"' (297). This can be illustrated also by Xarms's words about Blok, poetic reminiscences of which can be found in the narrative poem Pamjat' by I. Elagin: B~or - Ha o6opoTHoio CTopOHe Toil MeganIH, -- o6"acHHJI OH MHe,- Ha KOTopoi (OH py6HynJ cnrieqa)- PbIno JIe6eAesa-KyMana! (202) 18 The title of the novel (like the title of the play by Xarms discussed here) contains a parody in itself. Kozlinaja pesn' is a calque of the word 'tragedy' in Ancient Greek Tpay(s6ia-a goat-song. At the same time the goat's song reminds us of the swan song, which brings irony into the original meaning of tragedy implied in the title of the novel. WORKS CITED Aleksandrov, A.
