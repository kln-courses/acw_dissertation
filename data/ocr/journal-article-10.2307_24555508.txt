<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTIST'S BOOK BEAT Ich kann nicht sagen was das war was ich gesehen habe. I can't say what it was that I saw. This chap ter heading for a recent artist's book by Rose marie Trockel could do as refrain for the cho rus of response to her elusive, fragmentary work. Jedes Tier ist eine Kiinstlerin (Lund, Propexus, 1993, edition of 1,500, $100), a beau tifully produced publication designed by the artist with writer Wilfried Dickhoff to accom pany a December 1993 exhibition at the Anders Tornberg Gallery in Lund, is both explanato ry and exemplary. It doesn't assemble all the pieces, but it does open à lucid window on Trockel's work to date. And it speaks volumes for the ways an artist's book can maneuver between imperative text and indeterminate image—or, put differently, between interpre tation, as a viewer's prerogative, and expressed intention, as an artist's. The book's title, Jedes Tier ist eine Kiinstlerin, every animal is a (female) artist, is a play on a Beuysian dictum, Jeder Mensch ist ein Kiinstler, every man is a (male) artist.1 One way to look at Trockel's book is as an extended meditation on Beuys and his legacy, especially as it can be answered from a female perspective. Talking to a dead hare, cohabiting with a coyote, and insisting generally on the universality of the art impulse, Beuys spoke resoundingly for the extension of the concept "creativity" to agents other than human consciousness. Trockel, who has herself made extensive use of animal imagery, comes to Beuys as an open-minded skeptic. Precisely how inclusive is the Beuysian embrace? she wants to know. Does it include the posturing of her pet dog? The meandering trail of a cohort of poisonous procession-spin ner caterpillars? How about the caterpillars' shit? The cover of Jedes Tier is, embossed with a black and white photograph of a few dozen caterpillars in a disorderly little snarl. It is a typ ically mute image; DNA amok, the innocent viewer might conclude. Or a magnified burin stroke. Inside, the endpapers are scattered with even less prepossessing gray blotches; they could be splashes of mud, or a scatter of ink. It seems safe to say that few uninidated read ers would know they are looking at larval excre ment, nor do we ever see the butterfly that is larva's natural aesthetic fulfillment. Indeed, tantalizing, but incomplete and sometimes mis leading, clues and withheld information are defining premises of Trockel's book. Jedes Tier's first segment, titled "Natural Iso lation," is a series of spider webs spun inside five handmade glass vessels, shown in black and white photographs. Trockel has used spiders before, notably in the 1988 sculpture that con sists of a man's shirt in a vitrine, labeled 'Jus tine Juliette, Collection désir," and bedeviled by a busily spinning arachnid. A more recent work, a 1993 portfolio of photogravures, shows eight webs spun by drugged spiders. In a ninth sheet, the eight form a grid with an addition al web, which Trockel drew by hand, printed in ink that disappears when wet, leaving the image of a captured fly. One critic has seen Trockel's entire oeuvre, from the machine knitted panels, sweaters, and balaclavas on, as governed in part by the metaphor of Arachne's toils.2 In "Natural Isolation," Trockel does with out the references to Sade found in the 1988 sculpture, or, in the knit pieces, the meditations on mass production as it intersects with tradi tionally feminine craftwork. She does allude, broadly and specifically, to Duchamp: to his interest in extra-conscious determinants of art and to his observation, cited later in Jedes Tier, of a "spider web as an example of 'natural' iso lation of a carcass...." There is a vigorous nod to Louise Bourgeois as well, in the shape of the first glass vessel in particular and in the use of spider imagery in general.' But basically "Nat ural Isolation" lets the spiders spin their own stories. Only one botde is shown in its entire ty; the other photographs focus on isolated fragments of webs, cropped and lit to enhance their drama.4 In the second "chapter," titled "I Love Him as Much as My Children," Trockel (who is child less) plays William Wegman, casting a beloved dog—a fox terrier named Fury—as protagonist in a very primal romantic triangle. Fury and each of two fellow terriers, a female friend named Hannah and a foe named Fritz, are shown in paired mug shots, frontal and profile. All three dogs seem staunchly impassive, though in fact they are busy sending canine sema phores, in the form of the position of their ears—properly down, indecorously up, or, as in the case of the nemesis Fritz, a litde of both. Again, these are beautifully realized pho tographs, crisp, rich, and this time in living color.5 For all the particularity of these images, however, their meaning, which lies in the dogs' identities and relationships and the arcana of their expression, requires explanation not given in the book itself. In the third and fourth chapters, the cater pillars return. First, under the title "Rallip Re Tac" (caterpillar, backwards), they appear in a series of studio photographs of the same vari ety as the cover image: single-file processions, like marching bands at half time, that create glyphic marks—some look like letters, others</page><page sequence="2">like figures—on the empty field of the page.

While clearly a visual parable about the sexualized gaze—looking is inescapably equated with a furtive kind of touching—Das Intus Legere also alludes to literacy as, historically, a form of exclusive political power, at a time when visu al rhetoric was a more broadly enfranchising form of expression. Though these ideas are treated here with lyrical concision, they reflect Trockel's ongoing concern with the limits and responsibilities of visual communication, which will again be addressed in Jedes Tier. If Trockel's first artist's book is preceded by her own hybrid approximations, it is also antic ipated by category-bending books about her work, including the recent Anima, accompany ing a summer 1994 survey of her videos at MAK Gallery in Vienna.9 The more comprehensive monograph accompanying a 1991 survey orig Rosemarie Trockel, Jedes Tier ist âne Kûnstlerin, cover (above) and pages of artist's book and pamphlet, 1993.

This kind of interpretive orchestra has become almost standard in exhibition catalogues, which over the past decade have increasingly found alterna tives to a single conclusively explanatory essay. In so doing, they approach the format of land mark artists' publications on which Jedes Tfrralso builds. Duchamp's several publications-as boxes—notably the one annotating La mariée mise à nu par ces célibataires même of 1934 (Boîte verte) and the Boîte-en-valise oî 1941, with repro ductions of other work in various mediums— were meant to cast a shadow on the auratic life of the originals. "I wanted that album to go with the "Glass" because, as I see it, [the glass itself] must not be "looked at" in the aesthetic sense of the word," Duchamp said of the Boîte verte. "One must consult the book, and see the two together. The conjunction of the two things entirely removes the retinal aspect I don't like."10 As is apparent in her "Natural Isolation" refer ence, Trockel approaches her own practice as a book artist in a distinctly Duchampian spirit, with the qualification that her work in other mediums must be understood as subversive. Duchamp's boxes have had innumerable progeny, most recently in two radically differ ent publications, one accompanying a current John Cage survey, Rolywholyover ACircus, and the other Nayland Blake's The Philosopher's Suite at Thread Waxing Space. The first is a hand some, metallic-boxed compilation of dozens of facsimiles of documents by and about Cage, distributed by Rizzoli, at $60; in the exhibition proper, the same materials are available in pho tocopied form, five each day, for free. Blake's approach to the problem of documentation is a kind of premium-priced press kit: visitors can assemble their own photocopied booklet from ANIMA 114 A N I M A documents of their choice, at $6 the set; addi tional color xeroxes of illustrations are $3 each. Like Jedes Tier, Cage and Blake draw direcdy on Duchamp, and their publications similarly con-1 cern issues of access addressed in their exhi bitions. Other publications close to Trockel's are Lothar Baumgarten's 1991 Carbon, which reproduces photographs from an installation , and has a book of subjective narrative insert- ( ed, indexwise, in its back cover, and Alfredo , Jaar's 1992 Two or Three Things I Imagine About.

But the risks Trockel takes with , intention's safe reception are, in degree and , kind, all her own. 'Anders Tornberg contacted Trockel in the spring of 1990 and asked if she would like to do a book in connection with her exhibition at his gallery in Lund; with the support of an anonymous donor, Tornberg had produced six exceptional artist's books under the imprint Propexus. A year later, Trockel told Tornberg she was ready. It turned out all she was sure of was the book's title. 2 Deborah Drier, "Spider Woman: Rosemarie Trock el," Artforum, 30, September 1991, pp. 118-24. 3 Spider imagery has appeared in Bourgeois' draw ings since the '40s; it reappeared in a spectacular new sculpture that was the centerpiece of her recent exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum. 4Two of these photographs, realized as greatly enlarged photoetchings, were shown in the exhib it at Anders Tornberg Gallery. 5These were also shown at Tornberg, in prints that were, à la Thomas Ruff, very large (40x40 in.). 6The Cocteau/Picasso/Satie collaboration, with choreography by Leonid Massine, involved a several typecast characters—a Chinese Conjuror, a little American Girl, and two acrobats—performing "real life" gestures, as well as three Managers of different nationalities performing ones grotesquely unlifelike; the rigid stereotypy built into this ballet, for all its radicalism, seems at odds with Trockel's work, and Tornberg says she named it independently of its precedent. 'Jutta Koether, "Interview with Rosemarie Trockel," Flash Art, 134, May 1987, p. 40. 8 This is standard procedure at Parkett, which produces a limited-edition multiple with each featured artist and generally blurs the lines between artist-initiat ed pagework and standard editorial copy. 9 Along with a variety of writing, in German and Eng lish, by Marietta Franke, Elfriede Jelinek, Holger Liebs, and Peter Noever, there are stills here of 13 videos, including Parade and Out of the Kitchen into the Fire. Many of Trockel's videos involve animals; perhaps the best known is Tier Film ( 1978-90), shown as part of her survey at the ICA Boston. It is assem bled from 43 grainy, under-or-over-exposed film fragments of animals and near animals—a mer maid, a wolfman, children playing with a pigeon as if it were a ball. 10 Pierre Cabanne, Dialogues with MarcelDuchamp, New York, 1971, pp. 42-43.
