<plain_text><page sequence="1">THERMAL BIOLOGY Temperature Biology of Animals. A. R. Cessins and K. Bowler. Chap- man and Hall Publ., London, 1987. 339 pp., illus. $57.50 (cloth). A. R. Cessins and K. Bowler stated that this volume was to provide a comprehensive treatment of the biol- ogy of animals in relation to temper- ature. They have satisfactorily accom- plished their goal. Considering the diversity of the biological role of tem- perature, ranging from molecules to the whole organism, and the resulting intimidating volume of literature, the authors have been dramatically suc- cessful in furnishing a critical synthe- sis of that role. While not a mono- graphical review, the contents of this book should provide a salutary source of information for the research worker in thermal biology as well as biologists in general. The early chapters provide an over- view of the concepts of thermal en- ergy, heat transfer, the thermal envi- ronment, rate-temperature curves, and Q10, and are especially useful as a foundation for understanding the physical aspects of thermal biology and recognizing potential problems. For example, the authors stress cau- tion in deciding which temperatures should be used in thermal studies, and they characterize the problems in- volved in placing an organism in its proper place within the diverse ther- mal environment. The chapters of badymetabolic (ec- tothermal) and tachymetabolic (endo- thermal) animals, albeit not acknowl- edging Pough and Gans (1982) who question whether the distinction be- tween badymetabolic and tachymeta- bolic are applicable to either ecto- therm or endotherm, are excellent reviews of the subject. Pough and Gans also suggest that the term pre- ferred temperature used in this vol- ume has an anthropomorphic conno- tation and should be avoided. I found the discussion of why body tempera- tures of both endotherms and ecto- therms are set between 300 C and 450 C especially interesting, as well as the sections on thermoregulation of honeybee swarms and endothermic fish. The treatment of temperature-rate compensation satisfactorily illustrates the adaptative responses of organisms to temperature. The contributions of Precht (1958) and Prosser (1964) per- taining to the compensation of rate processes are clearly explained and the schematic representation of Precht's terminology is useful. The authors discuss the caution that must be exercised when viewing the results of laboratory acclimation experi- ments, because the subjects of these studies are often removed from their normal field environment. Another commendable contribution is the effective and succinct coverage of the cellular mechanisms of compensation March 1989 197</page><page sequence="2">and the genotypic adaptation to tem- perature. The authors' selection of literature cited, given the vast spec- trum available, was appropriate, al- though occasionally inconsistent. In summary, the authors have pro- vided a welcome and needed contri- bution to understanding how animals are influenced by and adapt to their thermal environment. In their over- view approach they have successfully ranged from physiology to behavior and from molecules to whole orga- nisms. I would enthusiastically rec- ommend this volume to students, teachers, and researchers in the fields of physiological ecology and compar- ative physiology. DANIEL C.
