ROLLEFSON Abstract : Six excavation campaigns have been undertaken at ' Ain Ghazal since the last report on ritual and ceremony was published in Paléorient Of particular importance have been the past four seasons, which have produced some architectural remains that are probably best interpreted as shrines and temples. Résumé : Six campagnes de fouilles ont été entreprises à ' Ain Ghazal depuis le dernier article publié dans Paléorient « Ritual and Ceremony ». Les quatre dernières campagnes ont présenté un intérêt tout particulier en raison des restes d'architecture mis au jour que l'on peut interpréter comme étant des temples et des sanctuaires.

INTRODUCTION Two earlier reports have provided a summary of information concerning ritual and ceremonial practices at 'Ain Ghazal1, but much has happened since the last article appeared. In the first place, the previous descriptions dealt almost exclusively with Middle PPNB material, particularly with burials, human and animal figurines, and lime plaster human statuary. By 1985, when the more recent article was written, very little was known about the post-MPPNB events at 'Ain Ghazal. After the seasons of 1988 and 1989 2, which were directed principally to continue exploration of the newly defined PPNC cultural ensemble3 and to investigate the circumstances of the Yarmoukian Pottery Neolithic developments at 'Ain Ghazal, a break in the field work ensued during which laboratory work concentrated on analysis of stratigraphy, artifacts, and archi- tecture. In 1992 it was learned that the privately owned property on which 'Ain Ghazal existed was in immediate threat of sale for commercial and residential development, and in conse- quence four subsequent seasons of emergency salvage archaeo- logy excavations were undertaken in 1993-1 996 4. The field work in the 1990s was particularly informative about ritual and ceremony, as well as other aspects of so- cioeconomic life at 'Ain Ghazal, because two new areas of the settlement were intensively sampled, including the North Field and East Field (fig. 1). In contrast to the Central and South Fields, where PPNC residents had virtually destroyed Late PPNB strata, the North Field revealed intact LPPNB de- posits, including impressive two-story architecture 5 from the latter half of the 7th millennium. In the East Field, scratched by two tiny probes in 1984 6 , deep deposits of LPPNB underlay thinner PPNC accumulations, and PPNC domestic presence was not a major feature of this part of 'Ain Ghazal across the Zarqa River from the main site. Yarmoukian presence in the East Field (and the North Field) was negligible7. In the 1. Rollefson, 1983; 1986. 2. Rollefson, Kafafi and Simmons, 1990; 1993. 3.

ARCHAEOLOGY, CULT AND "RITUAL ARCHITECTURE" "The heroic loftiness of all the frescoes , for that remote epoch , had already led experts to suggest to Father Koeppel a cultic scope , and he records that he sought in vain evidence of the sacred architecture which one would expect in connection with them. On this point two warnings must be voiced : (a) we cqnnot know a priori what would have been the cultic implements of a civilization so different from our own , (b) Conversely , it has been a snare of every Palestine excavation to be too disposed to assign a cultic function to striking ob- jects... "9 "The identification, excavation and interpretation of a ce- remonial centre is one of the most challenging undertakings in archaeology today. Nothing may be assumed by the exca- vator : there is no body of theory relating to the archaeology of religion to aid him in his interpretation ."10 The remarks by North and Renfrew must be kept in mind every time one considers a set of archaeological data to represent potential cultic, religious activity, especially when such material emerges from deep in the prehistoric archaeological record. The rich Levantine record of modeled skulls, decapitated bu- rials, plaster statuary, and many (if not all) clay human and animal figurines from the Neolithic period raises few doubts as to cultic associations for the physical remains of such emor tionally striking symbolic activity, but the ascription of religious 8. e.g., Schmandt-Besserat, 1997. 9.

The bulk of the architectural remains recovered through all ten seasons of excavations at 'Ain Ghazal has reflected patterns of design that are generally redundant for all of the four major periods represented at 'Ain Ghazal, including the MPPNB, LPPNB, PPNC and Yarmoukian phases. The struc- tural redundancies are repeated both across the sampled parts of 'Ain Ghazal as well as the rest of the southern Levant, and it is clear that there are temporal developments in domestic structures through the more than two millennia at 'Ain Ghazal and its sister settlements. But the recent seasons at 'Ain Ghazal have produced notable exceptions to building designs that conflict with "standard" domestic forms, and these exceptions conform to a growing pattern of "special" buildings claimed to have been associated with ritual functions in Anatolia in the north and in several sites in the southern Levant. Before engaging in a discussion of the probable religious affiliation of such buildings from 'Ain Ghazal, the following sections present a description of the architectural components by period and location in the settlement. LPPNB ARCHITECTURE In the late 8th and early 7th millennia be12 deposits ex- cavated at 'Ain Ghazal, MPPNB architecture revealed nothing that could be interpreted as other than normal domestic hou- ses13. In the latter half of the 7th millennium, the area of at least some LPPNB domestic structures increased well beyond MPPNB norms, including some one-story and two-story houses with up to 22 rooms, counting both floors 14. But buildings of apparently non-domestic use also appeared, including several examples of a new ground plan that incorporated at least one apsidal end in an otherwise rectilinear design, as well as two related structures with circular floor plans and, finally, a rec- tangular building with exotic interior features and "furniture" not seen elsewhere at 'Ain Ghazal nor elsewhere in the Ace- ramic Neolithic of the Levant. Fig. 2 : View towards the south of the LPPNB apsidal building later used by Yarmoukian inhabitants. (Photo : H. Wada). THE APSIDAL BUILDINGS At least three (and possibly four) apsidal buildings have now been identified in LPPNB contexts at 'Ain Ghazal, in- cluding one in the Central Field 15, one in the East Field, and a minimum of one and perhaps two in the North Field. (The questionable status of the "possible" apsidal building in the North Field is due to problems of preservation : the area where the apse may have been is missing, due to erosion and sub- sequent construction, but the room proportions that are pre- served conform to the other three buildings). Central Field. The apsidal building in the Central Field (fig. 2) is best preserved in terms of floor plan, although later Yarmoukian use severely damaged the surface of the lime plaster floor. The measurements of the building are ca. 4.5 X 3.5 m. There is a wall near the northern end of the structure that creates two rooms of unequal size (3.4 m N-S x 2.25 m E-W for the apse room, and ca. 1 m N-S x 2.25 m E-W for the smaller "antechamber"), but at the moment it is not clear if this wall is originally LPPNB or a later Yarmoukian al- teration16. Entrance into the building appears to have been from the north (i.e., at the end opposite the apse), although no clear doorway was found. A low orthostat was incorporated into the center of the apse wall, and next to it is a "pseudo- orthostat" consisting of one large stone stacked atop another. 1 1 . I would like to express my gratitude to three anonymous reviewers for their candid opinions on an earlier version of this manuscript. One reviewer in particular offered very helpful suggestions for improving the arguments. 12. Note : all dates are expressed in uncalibrated terms. 13. e.g., Banning and Byrd, 1984; 1987. 14. Rollefson, 1997. 15. One of these was originally ascribed to the Yarmoukian period, Rol- lefson, Kafafi and Simmons, 1990: 110-111, but it is now clear that this was a subterranean discovery and re-use of an LPPNB apsidal structure. 16. In : Rollefson et al ., 1990 : 1 10-1 1 1, this was originally thought to be a single-room structure, and this may have been so in the LPPNB period.

The apsidal phases N-l through N-2b appear just above (west) and to the left (south) of the Circular Building (CB) I. A firepit probably contemporaneous with CB I is at the right. (Photo : Y. Zo'bi). North Field 1-2 (N 1-2). While the Central Field apsidal building gives us valuable clues to architectural composition, the sequence of architectural modifications in the North Field provide the best indications that these buildings were not used as simple dwelling places, but that instead they served some special purpose for the people at 'Ain Ghazal. One building in Sqs. 5317 and 5517 underwent several changes, two of them happening in rapid succession áfter the original building construction (fig. 3). The first version (N-l) was oriented E-W, with the apse at the western end. Unfortunately, the eastern end was thoroughly destroyed by both later LPPNB construction and by post-abandonment erosion, and all that is left is the apse part of the room and very short segments of the straight northern and southern walls. After some time, represented by a 6-9 cm deep fill of dirt and trash on the red-painted lime-plaster floor, the building was revitalized, with a newly formed interior face of the apse reconstructed inside the frame of the earlier building, and a new red-painted lime-plaster floor laid over the fill of the earlier abandoned structure (N-2a). This renovation, which used soft limestone or chalk blocks as wall construction material, was poorly designed and short-lived, for the SW corner of the apse began to collapse inwards 17 . This, in turn, required a major salvation project in the form of a new wall built atop the floor, closing off the apse shape and creating a rectangular room in the third use of this building (N-2b). How long the "strange" rectangular shape lasted is not known, but it was not long until the next phase of use of this special area was undertaken, and the final architectural expression of this buil- ding would introduce a new groundplan that was unique for its time (see "Circular Structures" below). All three uses of the apsidal structure were associated with a courtyard west (uphill) of the buildings; if the entrance to the building was from the east (at the end opposite the apse), then the courtyard would have been behind the structure. The LPPNB courtyard used the floor of an older MPPNB house as its first surface, bounded by well built walls on the west, north, and south. Over time the plaster floor became heavily eroded, and there are clear episodes of repair, but using mud mortar to fill holes, and eventually reverting to a mud surface across the entire area defined by the courtyard walls. The NW corner of the courtyard witnessed a succession of several firepits. Charcoal from the earliest produced a date of 6286 ± 81 be (KN-5054), and a stratigraphically later firepit gave a date of 6212 ± 62 (KN-5055). North Field 3 (N-3). It is possible that a third apsidal building existed in the North Field, just about 10 m to the NW of the one described above. In contrast to N 1-2, N-3 would have been oriented N-S, with the apse probably located at the northern end of the building. The southern wall, of which only a few stones remained, clearly revealed a straight line; the entire western wall was robbed out, and the northern end of the building was eroded away after bulldozer damage during highway construction in the mid-1970s, and the eastern part of the building was destroyed by leveling in the LPPNB period related to the construction and remodeling of the two-story house 18. Nevertheless, a short (ca. 25 cm) part of the floor/wall 17. The use of the chalky limestone for this new apse-area wall construction is curious, since the raw material absorbs water and becomes pasty and unstable as a result. Certainly none of the LPPNB domestic houses used this chalky resource for walls, and one must question why this apsidal building used such soft stone. 18. Rollefson and Kafafi, 1996: 11-14.

The floor would have been at least 5 m long N-S, which is about a half-meter longer than the apsidal house in the Central Field. If this is not an apsidal building, it probably is a room of a MPPNB house ; a radiocarbon date from a nearby firepit may help determine the status of this building. East Field. At the southern end of the East Field another apsidal structure was unearthed in 1995 and 1996. It was orien- ted N-S, with the apse at the north and the entrance presumably at the south end (which remains unexcavated). The building appears to have been a single-room structure exposed over an area of 4 x 3.2 m (NS x EW). A circular basin hearth occurred in one of the several reflooring episodes of this room, and if the "geometric rule" of symmetry from the MPPNB continued to hold true in the LPPNB, the room would have been ca. 4.8 m x 3.5 m (NS-EW), very similar to the Central Field example and to the possible apse building N-3 in the North Field. This building appears to have at least two major phases of use, and perhaps more. Several reflooring episodes of the earliest phase are represented by a thick accumulation of lime plaster, the latest bearing a broad (8-10 cm) red band painted along the curved wall/floor join of the apse itself. It may be that every one of the sequence of floor surfaces was decorated : the final floor had a large checkerboard pattern of white rec- tangles (instead of squares) in reserve on an otherwise red field ; the size of the rectangles was variable, but they averaged ca. 30 x 40 cm on a side. Plaster was preserved fairly high up the eastern wall, but beyond patchy evidence for the use of red pigment, any possible designs were too eroded for any interpretation. A posthole along the eastern wall contained a broad semi-lenticular block of soft limestone as a base for the post ; this stone had also seen use as a mancala-type game board 19 . THE LPPNB CIRCULAR STRUCTURES Two buildings in the North Field are of particular interest because of their interesting shape. Both are virtually identical in groundplan form and dimensions. They are separated from each other by only about 4 m, and it appears that the southern "twin" was erected immediately after the other one fell into disrepair, perhaps due to earth subsidence (fig. 4). Circular Building I. The older of the two buildings (CB I) is actually the latest phase of use of the apsidal building N 1-2 described earlier (fig. 3). Sometime after the N-2b straight wall was built on the floor to close off the collapsing N-2a apse wall, virtually the entire floor sequence east of the apses of N 1-2 was removed in order to build a circular room 2.5 m in diameter with a doorway that led into a small, probably rectangular antechamber. (The dimensions of this small room could not be reconstructed due to severe post-abandonment erosion). There are eight floors directly superimposed on each other, each of which bears clear indications of red paint. Due to the presence of a thin calcareous deposit on the latest floor, it is not possible yet to say if there are any painted designs. The small space inside the circular wall was dominated by a hole 60 cm in diameter and ca. 40 cm deep. Radiating from the sides of this hole towards the walls were two pairs of subfloor channels, one pair roughly on a N-S axis, the other NE-SW (fig. 5). The channels were built of two parallel rows of limestone slabs (ca. 20 x 30 x 7 cm) that bore "cap- stones" of similar size, giving the channels a dolmen-like cross section ; the base of the channels did not use stones and consisted simply of the dirt on which the channel side-walls were erected. It is likely that these channels served as ducts to bring air into the central hole, perhaps to feed a fire in a raised hearth or altar20. It is difficult to determine if the spacious courtyard behind N 1-2 continued to be used, at least in terms of its former firepit sort of association, while CB I was in use. The stra- tigraphie sequence in the courtyard becomes very confused in its later functional stages, but it is likely that a well-made circular firepit just to the NW of CB I was used by the prac- titioners operating CB I (fig. 3). Circular Building II (CB II). CB I appears to have fallen into disuse; several large cracks, radiating from the central hole to the exterior walls, outline large sections of flooring that separated and shifted like ice floes in a thawing Arctic river, and some sort of subsidence appears to have ended CB Г s utility. But there was an apparent urgent need for a replacement, and quickly, for Shrine II was built with evident speed, even negligence. Unlike CB I, whose walls used large (ca. 20 x 30 x 35 cm) blocks of hard limestone and flint, the material used for the walls of CB II tended to fist-sized cobbles, usually of soft limestone. The thickness of the walls were similar, but the surfaces of the later structure were much less regular. The 19. Rollefson and Kafafi, 1997: 46 and fig. 14; Rollefson, 1996; cf. Rollefson, 1992 for an example from PPNC 'Ain Ghazal. 20. At the edge of the hole, the floor plaster began to rise vertically, as floor plaster commonly did along floor/wall joins. This indicates that some kind of installation rose from the hole above the floor. Paléorient, vol. 24/1, p. 43-58 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 1998</page><page sequence="6">48 G.O.

(Photo: Y. Zo'bi). foundation layer of mixed lime plaster and gravel that sturdily supported the first and later floors of CB I. The floors of CB II bore some indications of red paint, but the surfaces were so eroded that no patterns could be detected. Although the dimensions and shape of CB II are virtually identical to its predecessor, there is a major difference in design : there is no evidence for any subfloor channels, although there likely was a floor-level hearth/altar in the middle of the room. The presence of only two layers of flooring suggests that CB II did not last very long. It is not clear if there was an antecham- ber and entrance to CB II to the east, since this area (downhill) was severely eroded, perhaps in PPNC times. The LPPNB "Special Building" In the East Field a rectangular LPPNB structure was exposed in 1996 that has no other parallels at 'Ain Ghazal, nor anywhere else in the Levant for that matter. Located somewhat more than halfway up the hill in the center of the East Field, it is situated near the lowest terrace of limestone outcrops that marks Paléorient, vol. 24/1, p. 43-58 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 1998</page><page sequence="7">'Ain Ghazal (Jordan) : ritual and ceremony III 49 Fig. 6 : Plan of the first phase of the LP PNB "special building " in the East Field.

Only 10-15 m to the NE and SE are filled rockshelters that appear to have been undisturbed for long periods of time. The building is oriented EW, and the steep (35%) slope is responsible for the destruction of the western end of the building. The preserved structure is ca. 5 m EW by 4 m NS. The walls are made of dressed limestone blocks and are ca. 40 cm thick. The floor of the building, uncharacteristically for the LPPNB period, is of dirt and not lime plaster (figs. 6 and 7).

The three standing stones are at the extreme left and the floor hearth is in the center. (Photo : B. Degedeh). The structure underwent two, possibly three phases of use. The interior originally had "furniture" that is unique to LPPNB architecture in the Levant. Near the center of the building was a row of three standing rectangular limestone blocks ca. 70 cm high and roughly 25 x 35 cm in cross section; the three stones formed a line oriented N-S, but at the abandonment the central standing stone was dislodged, tumbling towards the western (downhill) direction (fig. 8). The earliest phase also had a square, red-painted lime plaster hearth between the standing stones and the eastern wall ; the hearth was sur- rounded by seven flat limestone slabs that were arranged so that the perimeter of the feature was generally circular. Near the southern end of the axis formed by the three standing stones was a floor feature defined by two long (ca. 1 m) rec- tangular blocks on the northern and southern edges of a clay Fig. 8 : View to the west of the eastern room of the LPPNB " special building ". The floor altar is at upper left , the three standing stones upper center, and the low platform upper right. (Photo : B. Degedeh). Fig. 9 : View to the NE of the floor altar during excavation. The southernmost standing stone is at the upper center and the tumbled middle standing stone at the upper left. (Photo : B. Degedeh). fill bordered on the eastern end by several irregularly shaped slabs of stone (fig. 9). The clay fill within this feature was relatively free of gravel and burned with such an intensity that the upper 2-3 cm had become "ceramically fired" : the surface was clean of any ash, charcoal, or other burned material. A second phase of the structure is clearly signaled by the construction of a low stone platform between the northernmost standing stone and the northern wall. This platform (ca. 25- 30 cm above the dirt floor) was set off from the rest of the room by two narrow walls that formed a small (less than 1 x 1 m) rectangular enclosure near the center of the northern wall, virtually using the northernmost standing stone as its Paléorient, vol. 24/1, p. 43-58 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 1998</page><page sequence="9">'Ain Ghazal (Jordan) : ritual and ceremony III 51 Fig% 10 : View to the east of the LPPNB " special building " showing the floor altar (far right), the standing stones (center), and the anthropomorphic orthostat in the blocked doorway of the rear (eastern) wall.

It is not certain if a third phase - earlier or later than the construction of the low platform - is indicated by a blocked doorway, or if this happened during the second phase as well. An opening approximately 80 cm wide was situated near the southeast corner of the eastern room, leading towards the uphill side of the building ; the vertical lines of the passageway are visible along the left side of the orthostat and at the tip of the north arrow in figure 10. The orthostat is dazzling white and appears to have been shaped to a roughly oval cross section, and a bulge at the top of the stone produces an anthropomorphic aspect to the column. (The stone is covered with a layer of grey calcretion at the top, and it cannot be determined if this prominence was intentionally shaped). PPNC ARCHITECTURE It has already been noted that PPNC domestic architecture consisted of two types of buildings : one type was the normal one-room single-family dwelling used by farmers who lived at 'Ain Ghazal throughout the calendar year, while the second kind was the semi subterranean storage bunker, known also as a "corridor building", associated with part-time residents at 'Ain Ghazal who spent much - if not most - of their time away from the settlement with flocks of sheep and goats in the steppe and desert21. No non-domestic structures had been uncovered until 1995 in the East Field, and the building shows clear carry-overs from the earlier LPPNB "special building". The PPNC "Special Building" Like its LPPNB predecessor, the PPNC "special building" 22 is oriented EW and measures, in its preserved dimensions, ca. 6 m EW by 3.5 m NS; the western end of the building is missing due to erosion and the laying of a sewer line in the 1980s (figs. 11 and 12). The walls are 70-90 cm thick, standing to a preserved height of at least 1.8 m along the eastern wall. As was common in PPNC structures, undressed field stones and river cobbles were used to build the walls. Charcoal from a firepit outside an underlying LPPNB house provided a terminus post quern for the "special building" of 6133 ± 47 be. The structure also has two rooms; the West Room is so badly preserved that little can be said of any interior arran- gements. The East Room is virtually intact, on the other hand. The floor is made of clay laid over a foundation of smooth river cobbles. The clay is mostly devoid of gravel or trash and appears to have been obtained from the excavation into sterile basal clay of a semisubterranean storage feature (mea- suring 2 m NS by 1.25 m EW and just over a meter deep) exterior and adjacent to the southeast corner of the "special building" (Fl in figure 11 and figure 13). At one time there was a doorway about 75 cm wide in the southern wall of this room, but it was later blocked. 21. Rollefson and Köhler-Rollefson, 1993. 22. As this manuscript goes to press, a new radiocarbon date has become available for a small sample from the floor of the building : 6,130 +/- 65 be, which should be considered as the time of abandonment. In other words, this building dates to the latter part of the LPPNB and not to the PPNC. I would like to thank Dr. Douglas Donahue for providing this information, and I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the University of Arizona and the National Science Foundation.

Across the top of the photo is the " special building " retaining wall. In the center of the rear wall is the altar on three pairs of standing stones, in front of which is the floor hearth of plaster. The structure at the bottom of the photo is an earlier LPPNB house. ( Photo : B. Degedeh). The "furniture" in the eastern room parallels in several ways the situation in the LPPNB "special building". A raised altar of two large limestone slabs, each about 60 cm in maximum dimension, was built against the center of the eastern wall. The slabs sit on three pairs of standing stones from 30 to 50 cm high; the southern slab sits 30 higher than the northern slab. Directly in front (west) of the central pair of supporting stones is a floor hearth of unpainted lime plaster (one of the rare instances of the use of lime plaster in the PPNC) about 60 cm in diameter; the hearth is surrounded by seven flat limestone blocks, although the seventh was missing when ex- cavated. At the center of the northern wall was a low cubicle made of limestone slabs; the sides of the feature measured about 70 cm each, and there was an opening towards the eastern wall23; the feature was empty. In the wall between the eastern and western rooms is an irregular doorway from 45 to 85 cm wide, and perhaps this opening was made when the doorway in the southern wall was closed up. Leading from the doorway is a narrow (45 cm) wall that enters the western room for a distance of 60 cm, then turns 90° towards the north. The screen wall effectively eliminates any view of whatever activities may have been carried out in the eastern room and creates, in essence, "a holy of holies". The only artifact found in the complex came from the dirt floor of the storage chamber behind the "special building". It was a large quartzite or indurated sandstone block with a roughly triangular cross section and ca. 35 cm on a side. On one of the broad faces were two deep, parallel grooves 5-6 cm wide; on the opposite broad face were several arcs of worn grooves sweeping across the length of the face to the other, resulting in a rippled, stepped surface from the sharper edge of the surface to the higher edge. Both faces bore thick 23. Through an oversight, this cubicle was left off the plan in figure 11. Paléorient, vol. 24/1, p. 43-58 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 1998</page><page sequence="12">54 G.O.

It cannot be determined if this axe "machine" had any direct (and therefore ritual) association with the use of the "special building". THE "SPECIAL BUILDING" RETAINING WALL The PPNC "special building" represents a major undertaking and must have involved the labor of a large percentage of the community. The initial phase of the construction was the excavatipn through 2.5 m of LPPNB deposits down to sterile clay to provide a level surface for the building, an undertaking that involved the removal of a minimum of 150 m3 of earth.

Note that the wall crosses directly atop the altar above the standing stones ; in front of the altar is the lime plaster hearth. The large stone at upper left is nearly a meter in maximum dimension. (Photo: Y. Zu'bi). Along with the semisubterranean storage feature, the eastern room was also partially semisubterranean, although the western part of this room, as well as the entire western room, were built on top of underlying LPPNB sediments. To protect the "special building", a retaining wall of large boulders was erected against the newly exposed section. The height of the wall was 2.5 m and at least 20 m long (the southern end has not yet been excavated), forming a gentle arc behind (east) of the "special building" (fig. 12). The top of the wall is a single stone thick (25-35 cm), but there is a slight batter at the bottom, where it is likely that the wall is two or three stones thick. Its general construction resembles closely the 2.8 m high LPPNB retaining wall that runs beneath the PPNC "special building"25. THE "BURYING WALLS" It is unknown how long the "special building" remained in use, but it is clear why it was abandoned : the eastern wall south from the altar to the SE corner had begun to topple inwards. But the nature of the building apparently precluded a simple evacuation. Instead, the figuratively "dead" "special building" was "buried" by means of two huge walls that cut NS across the complex26. The first of these burying w^lls 24. L. Quintero, pers. comm. 25. Cf. Rollefson and Kafafi, 1997 : 30. 26.

Forming a chord inside (to the west of) the curving retaining wall, the first burying wall extended for at least 11 m in a NS direction, although its southern end was not exposed. A second burying wall was erected about a meter farther to the west, built up against the inner face of the eastern wall of the "special building" and crossing directly over the altar (fig. 14). This wall included stones up to a maximum dimension of a meter, and like the other aspects of the complex, it rep- resented a considerable amount of effort. The northern end coincided with the beginning of the "special building" retaining wall, but the southern end was not excavated27. This burying wall was preserved to a height of just under 2 m. "SPECIAL BUILDINGS" AND RITUAL ASSOCIATION Renfrew has noted four behavioral areas of ritual activity that can have archaeological correlates under certain situations. The correlates pertinent to the identification of ritual architecture include the use of buildings set apart for ritual observances that might "involve both conspicuous public display and hidden exclusive mysteries"28. Particular features could exist in the buildings, including altars, hearths, benches, special recepta- cles, and other attention-focusing devices. Symbols are likely to be present, often associated iconographically with deities29 and associated myths. Maintenance of the sacred area might have emphasized cleanliness. And such ritual buildings may reflect a "great investment of wealth and resources" in both the building and the interior features30. One element of architecture that is basic in terms of iden- tifying ritual function is the criterion of "exclusivity" : that a religiously used structure is "not explicable in secular terms in the light of what we know of the society"31. Renfrew also reminds us of a crucial distinction : that ritual activities can have a domestic focus or a communal one32. There is the possibility that structures (or rooms of buildings) may have undergone changes in function during their uselife33, and if such structures were domestic buildings where rites were con- ducted at the household level, architectural evidence of the ritual nature of the building or room may not be easy to detect34. The size, location and interior assemblage of features, then, are important factors in the identification of communally-orien- ted cult buildings. The situation for MPPNB architecture at 'Ain Ghazal re- mains uncertain : only c. 250 m2 of MPPNB deposits have been exposed, and until now nothing suggests any construction whose design was specifically directed towards ritual use at either the household or community level. The two groups of 27. While we were able to dismantle the eastern «burying wall», we had to leave the part of the second wall that ran from the altar to the southeastern corner of the building, otherwise the eastern wall would have collapsed. 28.

Rollefson MPPNB human statuary - which were patently associated with religious purposes, probably beyond the household level - were found in situations that conclusively reflect ritual treatment at the end of their use-life35. But while both statue caches were found beneath house floors, in both cases the relevant buildings had been abandoned long before the statues were buried. We expect that the statues and busts were displayed on a permanent basis36, but we cannot be certain what the circumstances of that display were. It is now clear that MPPNB sub-floor burials represent special treatment for certain members of a household, perhaps on a generational basis37. The distribution of burials around the hearth of a room and the burial of skulls in room corners indicates that some rooms took on a ritual character at times, even though there are no clear features to indicate this household-level observance. The redundancy of MPPNB domestic architecture at 'Ain Ghazal contrasts markedly with the variability of structural types during the subsequent periods in the settlement. In the LPPNB layers are single- and two-story buildings common throughout Jordan38. But the Apsidal Buildings, the Circular Buildings, and the Special Building are relatively rare (Table 1). The state of preservation of the LPPNB domestic houses that have been excavated so far is relatively poor, although some general observations about room arrangements and the functions of some house areas can be made39. The presence of five pairs of gazelle horns still articulated with skull frag- ments in one area of the two-story house in the North Field may be an indication that one part of the upper floor may have had a special role in ritual observances. The Apsidal Buildings are the most difficult to interpret, for they occur in several orientations and are scattered in "neigh- borhoods" across both sides of the Zarqa River. It is probable that they are at least partly contemporaneous with the two-story domestic structures, as the evidence in the North Field indicates. Since they are so much at variance with the "architectural grammar" for housing units, the Apsidal Buildings very likely played a different role in the social organization of the com- munity, and the elaboration of the floors (red-painted designs on lime plaster) and the presence of parabolic basin hearths are arguments against a simple storage function for them ; the presence of the orthostat and "pseudo-orthostat" in the Central Field example suggests some symbolic meaning that must be taken into account. Additionally, the superposition of the Cir- cular Building over Apsidal Building N 1-2 indicates a potential continuity in the purpose of the structures (see below). In general, one might conclude that Apsidal Buildings served a special function beyond the household level, but it is not yet possible to determine whether this role was associated exclu- sively or even in part with cultic activities. The Circular Buildings are absolutely rare, particularly if one of the known two was the direct successor of the other. Here, the principle of "exclusivity" takes on more weight in an argument for a ritual role for these small but imposing structures. The subfloor channels, the central fireplace/altar, the repeated reflooring episodes, and the rarity of the groundplan combine to signal a non-domestic use, and cultic activity is a strong candidate. The small size and the close proximity to domestic architecture might imply that it was a shrine as- sociated with several families or a lineage. The LPPNB Special Building (like its later PPNC coun- terpart) is simply - almost startlingly - unique. The absence of a lime plaster floor (perhaps symbolically represented by the flat, red-painted hearth), the absence of a "normal" parabolic basin hearth, and the presence of the floor altar, the three standing stones, and the anthropomorphic orthostat place the structure far outside the domestic sphere, and there is no in- dication (as in the Circular Buildings) that Hodder's admo- nition40 of a functional evolution is applicable here. The north-south axis of the standing stones segregated the eastern from the western sections of the structure, reinforced by the placement of the floor altar and the later platform addition against the northern wall. The eastern section, with the flat hearth and anthropomorphic orthostat, was clearly a special area and was probably restricted in terms of who could have entered there. The placement of the building, high on the eastern slope of the Zarqa River and in full view of the main settlement, definitely relates to the attention-focusing aspect cited by Ren- frew, and in view of the constellation of features of this building, it is logical to conclude that it was a cult building. Its size and location suggest it may have been oriented towards com- munal ritual activity, operating as a temple for the entire po- pulation of 'Ain Ghazal. The PPNC Special Building shares many of the striking features of the LPPNB temple. While it is not located high on the slope, it does occupy a spot isolated from the main PPNC occupational area. The large amount of labor associated with the construction of the building complex strongly favors 35. Rollefson, 1983; 1986. 36. Cf. Тивв and Grissom, 1995 : fig. 3 caption. 37. Rollefson, 1998. 38.

There was nothing similar to the LPPNB anthropomorphic orthostat, but the threatening collapse of the eastern wall of the East Room may have resulted in the removal of any symbol devices from being harmed. Once again, there is a strong likelihood that we are dealing with a temple. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS The "special buildings" from 'Ain Ghazal are not unique in the Levant : Neolithic ritual buildings are also known in Anatolia from Çayônû 41 , Nevalí Çori 42, and perhaps at Göbekli Tepe43 ; in the southern Levant Kenyon reported a shrine from Jericho44 and Kirkbride described three temples uncovered at Beidha45. Despite variations in specific details, all of these examples show that regardless of settlement size, PPN popu- lations set aside special structures for semi-public (in the case of smaller shrines that were oriented to groups of related fa- milies) and to public rituals that cemented community rela- tionships and identity. There are important aspects of social organization entailed in such religious edifices. It is clear from the archaeological record that the southern Levant experienced serious difficulties beginning in the mid-7th millennium46, and these stresses must have multiplied the centrifugal forces of individual family in- terests that increasingly threatened to split communities apart. While kinship groups were involved in securing economic security, even at the expense of competing kin groups in the settlement, the cooperation of unrelated families in the pooling of labor - sometimes a considerable amount - for the cons- truction of communally enjoyed religious buildings served to dilute the strength of self-interests, and the practice of rites directed towards the common good would have added to the feelings of community and to the bonds of social unity. Who was personally responsible for such ritual celebration remains unknown, but conjecture can provide a basis for dis- cussion. Family- and kin group-oriented rituals, such as burials, mate exchange, marriages, and other rites de passage , may have been undertaken and overseen by shamans who were themselves related to the different lineages or clans ; depending on the size of the groups, such ceremonial leaders may have served either on a part-time or full-time basis. Community- wide observances might have been more seasonally oriented, and here one could argue that some panel of full-time "priests" may have been in charge of the solemn rites and festivities; presumably they represented a cross-section of the kinship structure of the community, although it is also possible that they may have had no overt kin relationships at all with the rest of a settlement's inhabitants. But such speculation could go on endlessly, and at the present time there is no strong evidence to indicate who led what kinds of activities in the cult buildings in the Levant. More information to add better insights might be forthcoming by dismantling the structures, although with the arguments for the intact preservation of such structures for reasons of national heritage or tourism, such an approach must be co- ordinated closely with local antiquities officials.
