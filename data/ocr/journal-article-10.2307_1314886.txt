<plain_text><page sequence="1">Responses and Discussion Response by Gerald Graff Let me begin by making clear my own position: I believe that literature--or at least "eminent" literature--does make truth claims, and makes them in the same way non-literary statements do. This puts me in some respects in agreement, in some respects not, with Gadamer: truth as a property of literature, yes; but a special kind of truth, no. The problem of whether or not literary works possess any truth seems to me the central problem of literary criticism. It's the central problem because the authoritl of the humanities turns on how it is answered--as does the strategy by which the humanities defend their discipline in an often unpromising cultural environment. Twenty or thirty years ago, this problem was at the forefront of Anglo- American criticism. I am thinking of the New Critical debates over the "problem of belief," of Eliot and Richards' struggles with the problem, which were continued by the second generation of New Critics. This problem has lately been displaced by a prior problem: can the text be interpreted, and if so, how? But this is itself a variant of the problem of truth transferred to the level of criticism: can interpretation be true? As everybody knows, it was Plato who posed the problem in a fundamental way. One way of viewing the history of criticism is as a series of responses to Plato's argument in Book X of the Republic that "poetry" (or literature) has no truth--or at least no real truth. There are only two kinds of responses to Plato's challenge, and we can range critics according to whether they adopt the one or the other. 1. On the one hand, we can concede Plato's proposition that literature has no truth and then go on and defend literature on other grounds. 2. On the other hand, we can contest Plato's proposition and then try to say what kind of truth literature does have--if not truth to Plato's Ideas, then some other kind of truth. The first of these strategies, concession, became popular in the romantic period in theorists like Kant, Schiller, and Schopenhauer. It leads to twentieth-century formalism and art-for-art's-sake. The conceder says, in Gerald Graff chairs the Department of English at Northwestern University. He is author of Poetic Statement and Critical Dogma (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970) and Literature Against Itself: Literart Ideas in Modern Society (University of Chicago Press, 1979). Gerald L. Bruns is Professor of English at the University of Iowa. His publications include Modern Poetry and the lIea of Language (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974). Tom Conley teaches French literature at the University of Minnesota and has published articles in Diacritics, IMLN, Sub-Stance, and other journals. Donald G. Marshall teaches English and Comparative Literature at the University of Iowa. His publications include articles in Boundary 2, Diacritics, and The Partisan Review. Response by Graff 11</page><page sequence="2">effect, "yes, Plato is correct that literature has no truth; but it doesn't matter, since the value of literature lies elsewhere, in its 'coherence,' or some other property or power." In this strategy, you concede Plato's description of literature as far as it goes, but turn it from an indictment into an encomium. Literature has no real truth, but this is precisely what is good about it. This strategy is especially attractive in a bourgeois and technological age, where "truth" is often identified with reductive positivism, with fact-mongering, moralism, and bourgeois banality--finally with alienation and death. Gada- mer's remarks on Kitsch illustrate this identification of certain kinds of truth--propositional kinds--with such degraded forms of life. The alternate way of answering Plato is to face him down and say, "no, you're wrong; literature does too give truth." Here you are under the obliga- tion to decide what kind of truth you want to ascribe to literature, the same kind of truth as is claimed by other modes of discourse or some special literary kind of truth. Many critics from Aristotle down to Samuel Johnson thought of literary truth as of much the same order as the general truth given by moral philo- sophy, though presented in a different way. Some of the romantics thought of it this way too, but by the romantic period a problem had arisen that made it difficult to continue thinking of literature as Sidney and Johnson had. The critic who wanted to claim truth for literature had to deal with the problem of how this truth related to the objective truth of science. Those who defended literary truth had to deal with the question of how that truth differed from the truth of science--and some of them ended by making some contrast with the referential functions of science the defining principle of literature. By this logic literature became a kind of humanistic complement to the hard truth of science. This is the strategy of "refusal" which Gadamer has mentioned. The outcome of all this was a tendency to define literary truth as a form of truth that is not "about" anything, that does not correspond to or refer to anything outside its own symbolic form, the way a proposition does. Literary truth is lived in, not known as an abstract generalization, is existential rather than referential, and so on--through many permutations of this now very familiar antithesis between the truth of being and the truth of knowing. Gadamer espouses one version of this anti-scientific position, though he seems to be talking not about literary truth (or the truth of "eminent" texts alone) but about all deeper truth. "A word," he writes in Truth and Method, "is not an existent thing which one takes up and to which one accords the ideality of meaning in order to make something else visible through it" (377). In other words, Gadamer's truth is a truth without "aboutness," which is to say it is not an affair of correspondence or reference or propositionality. For Gadamer truth is something we inhabit, as we inhabit language, not a relation 12 Response by Graff</page><page sequence="3">between language and some extralinguistic object or order of objects, as in science. And yet, Gadamer seems also to strain toward a correspondence theory of language, for he speaks of literature as giving us access to an Other, of opening us up to Being--ideas that seem at odds with his apparent rejection of the correspondence model. Now when we look closely at such equivocal attempts to define literature (or in this instance, all profound forms of discourse) in terms of a special mode of truth, a curious thing happens: they become harder and harder to distinguish from the theories which assign literature no truth at all. The existential truth that is claimed for literature by those who contest Plato's denial of literature's truth begins to look like the non-truth or quasi-truth or mere coherence attributed to literature by the concession strategy. And any attempt to "defend" literature by appealing to such shadowy concepts of truth will only contribute to making literature even more ineffectual than it is already by grace of the indifference of modern society. But whatever strategy we choose in dealing with this problem of literary truth, we come up against a prior problem: how do iwe know how to deal with this problem? What basis do we have for deciding claims of literature's truth or lack of it? Theorists make various assertions about the truth or non-truth of literature, but are there any ways of testing these assertions? My view is that recent "reader response" criticism may provide a way out of the theoretical deadlock over this question. I suspect that an empirical examination of the way readers actually make sense of literary texts might confirm the theory that truth is a relevant factor in our experience of litera- ture. I have no time to develop this argument, but I suspect that thematization--the processing of literary data by locating thematic state- ments that integrate it--may be crucial to the way qualified readers read; and that readers tend to take these thematic statementsmore seriously as state- ments than formalist theory is willing to concede. Gadamer's theory moves in the direction of recognizing the importance of this truth function, though it fails even to raise the question of how we know it is there. And Gadamer, it seems to me, needs to resolve the ambiguities of his theory by taking the final plunge--into propositionality, correspondence, "aboutness," as qualities of the "eminent" text. In this direction lies the final demystification of literary meaning. Response b i Graff 13</page><page sequence="4">Response by Gerald L. Bruns Truth is a topic on which we tend to speak at cross-purposes, which is a sign that we haven't thought much about it. The subject in fact hardly ever comes up in academic literary study. I won't say the word is never used, but it does not have much status, which is another way of saying that it isn't of much use. It belongs to an array of topics on which we feel encouraged to throw suspicion: presence, for example, and knowledge of what things are. Thus people speak of validity rather than of truth. Or, again, we take truth to be chiefly freedom from illusion. Knowledge is not of things but is rather a condition of certitude in which one knows nothing officially beyond the fact that one is not deceived. Anyhow our concern is not with truth but with how things work--how poems are made, for example, or how words mean or fail to mean; how illusions are formed and how they are naturally invisible to the untrained eye. We are, in other words, concerned with the technology of literary culture, or the culture of writing, whereas truth is technologically incomprehensible. There is no knowing how it works, because in fact it doesn't work at all. It possesses no function. It cannot be contained within the categories of operations and results. We cannot conceive it as a problem to be solved--or, more accurately, when we attempt to conceive it as a problem it loses its reality and becomes what we suspected it to be all along: an illusion. In most cases people use the word "true" as an easy substitute for"correct." Gadamer belongs to and, indeed, clarifies and makes accessible a tradition that opposes such usage, not because such usage is false, but because it is incomplete. Thus a text is called "eminent," not because it accurately repre- sents this or that state of affairs--not because it lends expression to a particu- lar view of things or to a combination of indispensable ideas. An eminent text is never merely "correct": it does not depend on anything for its eminence-- that is, it does not stand out by virtue of its correspondence to anything, and certainly not because it agrees with any version of things that we may have settled upon or authorized as "true." A tacit recognition of this fact once threw people hard upon notions of form and beauty as ways of valuing and authorizing texts, or in order to retain them in the canon of received or written culture. Nothing is correct which is not also contingent, whereas form and beauty belong to a world of necessary relations. From Gadamer's point of view, however, the eminence of a text is never conferred by anyone; it does not repose upon a critical or aesthetic judgment. Eminence is not esteem but emanation; it is not an attribute but an event. Its truth resists, and survives, ideology and taste. Truth here is phenomenological in Heidegger's sense. It is not anything that is disclosed but disclosure as an event which occurs in or(as Heidegger might say) with the work or text. Truth is not reducible to an object or content or 14 Respon.se h Y Bruns</page><page sequence="5">theme of knowledge. The hermeneutical paradox, however, is that it is precisely this truth which we must try to understand. Gadamer's achievement is to have preserved this task from a perhaps eternal repose within Heidegger- ian mystery. Yet it remains the case that in literary study today it is hard to know how to describe the characer of this hermeneutical task. Literary study speaks the language of objects and relations, not of truth; nor is it easy to see, given its history, how it could do otherwise. We can hardly ask literary study to become something other than itself. Yet it appears that the mentality of our profession is so organized and conditioned as to make it impossible for us to imagine what it would be like to understand the truth of an eminent text. It is as if we had been programmed for the sniffing out of falsehood; it is as if our talent were not for the understanding of what a text says but for outwitting it by showing how in speaking its recourse is always to some unseen rhetoric. We try to arrive at truth by listening for and catching the lie. One has only to consider the fate of Scripture in literary study to see how we must alter a text before we can understand it. Perhaps the way out of this is to consider with greater care the notion of meaning. Heidegger says that the ancients had no word for language, but what they really lacked is a word for meaning. The Stoics, needing to fill a logical gap, produced a term "lekton" that would make it easier to explain how signs work (the Stoics seem to have been the first to understand that a sign need not refer to a thing in order to make sense). In the notions of meaning that we work with today we have hardly advanced beyond the Stoics. Wittgenstein alone seems to have produced a conception of meaning that, whatever its theoretical limitations (which Wittgenstein tried heroically to preserve), enables us to say more clearly what happens when we make sense. Nevertheless, our critical passions have led us away from Wittgenstein toward a comic condition in which we continue to make sense from day to day, thanks to the unkillable nature of practical knowledge, yet our theories persuade us that making sense is indistinguishable from the making of illusions. Defenders of intelligibility, minor disciples of Wittgenstein excepted, are of little help, fixed as they are on principles of intentionality, referentiality, and contextuality that even the Stoics would have found naive. The question I would ask of Gadamer is: How do you speak of the relation of meaning and truth? It could be that from Gadamer's point of view the question is beside the point. Yet since the beginning of the nineteenth century the interpretation of texts or statements has increasingly come to rely upon the separation of meaning and truth as an authorizing principle. "By Ben- tham," John Stuart Mill wrote, "men have been led to ask themselves, in regard to any ancient or received opinion, Is it true'? And by Coleridge, What is the meaning of it?" (Mill came to see that perhaps the wrong people were Response hb Bruns /5</page><page sequence="6">asking the right question.) This distinction, which in one or another of a hundred forms became the first principle of historicism, was a death blow to the ontological seriousness--one might say the eminence--of the human sciences. Henceforward a text, to be esteemed, had only to show a certain indefatigable interpretability, a sort of relentless or inexhaustible (because purely formal) intelligibility, even though its meanings were always histori- cally or aesthetically circumscribed: the text, however eloquently it might speak, never speaks to us. We eavesdrop upon its discourse, on occasion we admire the superior humanity of its values, and its language may provide an inventory by which we may voice our own concerns, but never would we propose that the text speaks in our behalf, nor would we ever so embarrass ourselves as to speak in its name. Texts are closed. They are contextual, and we are always beyond their contexts, unless we appropriate them to our cause, or value their use or correctness. The end of literary study is to understand what is said. Perhaps we need to know rmore about the nature of this understanding. Surely it cannot be merely decipherment. The end of literary study is understanding, yet from Heidegger we learn that this end is confounded by what we try to understand, because it is in the character of a work of art to withhold itself from understanding, that is, to reserve its most essential part of itself to itself, or to close itself up before every effort that we make to break down its reserve and to understand it as, presumably, it understands itself. It appears now, however, that truth and meaning are separated in another way, this time in behalf of truth as disclosure, unconcealment, aletheia--that which is not reducible to meaning, and which therefore cannot be made a part of literary study as we practice it today. It appears to be that on this matter we need a philosopher's guidance. Response by Tom Conley 'without going into comparisons and details, it should be realized that words consisting of only capital letters present the most difficult reading--because of their equal height, equal volume, and equal width.' an eminent text would therefore, if we grafted hans gadamer's "eminent text and its truth" to josef alber's preface (here and there signed ja) to the masterwork entitled the interaction of color, aspire to eminence with a melange of characters, where an elite of he looks over the platitude of the black forest of masses in Ic. without going into prefatory remarks to frame or describe our extension to his essay (now abbreviated in italic as etat), it should be evident that nothing would be more pretentious, indeed innocuously kitchy than printing our addendum in lower case, in one paragraph, without footnote to ground its remarks. can this form aspire to the function of critique? it smacks of academic, hesitant effort to wrangle out of the very mobile, plastic concepts 16 Response by Conley</page><page sequence="7">that enmesh thinkers born of the textual phenomenon bound and wound about the voice of truth in character. lowering the character would be tantamount to indicating another modest, half-lost eminence recalling the "little a" smothered under a svmbolique (borrowed for its instance of'truth' from the lacanian idiolect--hence in italic) that upper case surmounts by virtue of its monument. by drawing attention to the absence of eminence on a flat upper surface, our strategy would repress the proper name or german noun "disclosed" from the platitude of a sentence. our postface in Ic would be all the more a sign of kitch, reproducing the hierarchy of flatness so common to the script of fascism if we remember the lower case "effect" of upper case captions in italian railway stations (milano centrale), in tarzan comic books of the 1930's ("prince jagurt treacherously made the sign of peace only to draw tarzan within the circle of guards, then seize him. leccia was shocked by her fiance"s cowardly deceit, and she sympathized with his handsome victim," illustrated by alain rey in les spectres de la bande: essai sur la b.d., paris: 6ditions de minuit, 1978, p. 131) or in vitagraph glossy photos of golden age films of hollywood ("edward g. robinson marlene dietrich george raft in 'manpower,'" quoted from subscription to a still advertising raoul walsh's film of that title). yet through a visible strategy, invoking imminence-- echoing immanence if we mime a heideggerian manner--we realize that the capital-uncapital writing born of the bauhaus and theory of gestalt was in complicity with fascism to the extent that the capital letters, in drag of their identities in lower case, repressed projection of caudal forms below the line--which our essay in this number of the mmla proves in the example of the gj p in this sentence. in wholly upper case sentences majuscule shapes look as if they are minuscule; the leaders that are the noun are also the verb; the reading people has the illusive reflection of being its own leader and populace and at once vice-versa. so perhaps the eminence of a text seen from below, as is the case of our page, offsets the will to dominance in the power of eminence which hans gadamer sets next to and links with an and to truth, seemingly inherent to it because of its its arising, eminently, as if from nowhere becom- ing now here. so too the truth of an eminent text--an etat-- would have to be written all across, like the tarzan comic strip, in upper case in guise of a lower case. yet this would be difficult to read, as a noted, leaving us to speculate that the basic figure gadamer sifts from textuality, the weave and tissue, may be thoroughly illusory since the web and thread of this figure of the ground of an eminent text is mascara over a far simpler difference of projection seen solely in between two faces of type. the weave of a truthful text would be all the more alluring in german: a sense of weave would be visible in nouns jutting over the sentences and in barbs of the letters piercing the imaginary line we visualize as ground to the figures we follow. as metaphor "weave" would therefore Response by Conlev 17</page><page sequence="8">mythologize a zigzag course or recall the dog-tooth design traced from capitals to points below the line and up again. or we must note that the illusion of characters binding themselves in an arabesque, a tissue, really pulls the wool over our eyes. adding the effect of the weave, to form the effect of..brings to bear on the materiality of letters which are hardly woven, and woven all the less since graphics have long since abandoned the figure of the die and necessary cast, the puncheon and mold, hill and valley that had given an air of truth to print. no longer do we run our fingers over the mmla to recall the force stamping down a meaning on paper, as we now see immediately that photo-offset calmly offers the effect of meaning in the reproduction of types that formerly struck the paper. now, devoid of ridges, the text we see and feel is more 'truthful' when we touch the indifferent platitude of its photo- computerized design. the very process printing hans gadamer's text and our addenda all but disallows any figure to accede to meaning. at this point our critique would seem off-color, indeed malicious in an appeal to literalize etat as a montage of type. but no. etat threshholds the not-so-bold strokes of writing seemingly born of figure and ground (or mother and father, etc.) that wills to flatten the rapport between them. for instance, in beckett's molloy two sections of almost exactly 130 pp. meet each other at beginning and end. in the miles of gloss anglo-american readers have invested into the 'vision' of the text we must remember that the first half by molloy is cut from two paragraphs (one of two pages and the other of 128 pages), and the second by moran attempts with less and less success to cut and divide, to digest itself into an order of calm. molloy had had his character survey the fiction from an eminence, where he could make out a landscape, like the dakota plains, where capital a and b do not exactly trace the pattern of a weave, recounting when and where the text took place, how its words veered to truth would be the frame that gadamer or ja can provide for an adequate reading. so much the better until the narrator, at the onset, notes how "i've forgotten orthography, too, and half of the words. that has little importance, it seems. i hope so. he's a funny type of guy, he who comes to see me. he comes every sunday, it seems" (p. 8). the french version of the original undoes whatever metaphysical chiaroscuro the landscape would have offered, since the "guy", the editor taking the manuscripts, is an odd type: "j'ai oubli l'orthographe aussi, et la moitie'des mots. cela n'a pas d'importance, parait-il. je veux bien. c'est un drole de type, celui qui vient me voir" (paris: e'ditions de minuit, 195 1). it must be noted that the citation in lowercase falsifies the original. when however the stringent laws of copyright-profiting from the myth of "originality" of "ideas" or "style"--thwart the need to quote so basic to critical writing, various distortions, ellipsis or paraphrase must now supplement traditional means of quotation. a new type of purloined novel in the heritage of walter 18 Response by Conley</page><page sequence="9">benjamin may emerge from the exiguities that new means of reproduction have wrought. yet the false quotation above anticipates the lower case charac- ter of comment c'est and is hence somewhat faithful to beckett.) words fold back in a translative platitude of a text "woven" about syncopes of transfer, letting us proceed, from gadamer's point of departure, to recognize that the character for which molloy goes in search is constituted by his crutches. it is a french beckett, a pair of bequilles or y-like signs of ibersetzung inversely straddling a valley that lends an air of eminence to the tradition of allegorical voyage from which the novel is printed. "mais je suis tranquille, je ne les perdrai pas. mes be'quilles non plus je ne les perdrai pas. mais je les jetterai peut-etre un jour. je devais me trouver au sommet, ou sur les flancs, d'une eminence peu ordinaire, sinon comment aurais-je pu plonger mes regards sur tant de choses proches et lointaines, fixes et mouvantes. mais que venait faire une eminence dans ce paysage a peine ondule? (p. 18). ("but i'm ok, i won't lose them. i won't lose my crutches either. but one day maybe i'll throw them away. i had to be located at the summit, or on the sides of a hardly ordinary eminence, if not how would i have been able to plunge my attention into so many things near and far, fixed and moving. but what did an eminence happen to do in this scarcely undulating landscape?") that beckett uses eminence to reproduce a vantage point points to the fact that description can be either anthropomorphic or typographic in design. here we could note how molloy decaudes eminence in the very fashion that advertising recaudes it in phallocentric innuendo, since the largest selling brand of french jockeyshorts is eminence (with images of philippe de champaigne's cardinal richelieu in emblem). beckett's translative eminence devoid ot hill and dale--between body and page--serves, to be the thresholding of etat, to catalyze analysis of the proper name attached to merchandise which, as trademark, is conceived with energies and interest literature would otherwise like to possess. suffice it to repeat that beckett's platitudinous eminence undoes the desire pro- grammed in major media. (on these issues of typeface defusing the anticipa- tions of meaning, we refer the reader to kimball lockhart's handsome "figure of the ground," enclitic, 6, 1979, forthcoming, a text proving what hartley, burnhill and davis find in "the effects of line length and paragraph denotation on the retrieval of information from pose text," visible language. 12, spring 1978, 183-94.) to return to the point of our commentary, translation of two or more languages within one printed form typifies gadamer's figure of weave in etat andja's note on 'contexture' to the effect that "in reading we do not read letters but words, words as a whole, as a 'word-picture'. this was discovered in psychology, particularly in gestalt psychology. opthamology has disclosed that the more the letters are differentiated from each other, the easier is the reading" (ibid). poetic texts whose force depends on words cut up and across Response by Conley 19</page><page sequence="10">each other would make such a sentence another homage to the square: in its crossing over every which way, translation of a text within itself exacts decipherment splaying forth through words whose quadrature their letters, in any case, will undo. so we cannot but see in the discourse of gadamer and ja residue of the didact. in their essays the truths of relativity stand on the shine of weltanschauung which their teaching imparts by virtue of a sense of eminence. the remainder of self-containment in such sight of the world from above, as from the socle of a capital t, finds its debris in the after effect of computed linotype. if the pedagogue has the privilege of containment where he determines that a word or text is a whole, his move to do so forces the letters of literature, its calligraphical drive across and within sentences which appeal to platitude to strut away, with or without crutches, from the horren- dous rules of meaning and daily clarity, or to be withdrawn from the surface on which poets have always staked claim. if we are to make literature and critical gesture converge like beckett's a and b, we must run the risk of abandoning the foothold of truth in movement which has, as always, been the teacher's ground. Summary of Discussion by Donald G. Marshall The miracles of modern technology have limits, and so, even though Gadamer's replies to questions from the audience are recorded, most of the questions were lost in the large room where his presentation took place. This is a serious loss for a philosopher who has taken question-and-answer as the very model of humanistic thinking and knowing. What follows tries to reconstruct the dialogue that occurred. Where the speaker is named, the text is reasonably reliable, but has been slightly edited in accordance with that art of writing /or reading of which Gadamer spoke. Gadamer (to Prof. Conley): I have the impression that when you heard the word "eminence" or "eminent," you liked it. I don't like it. My purpose was much more modest, and your remarks transcend my competence by far. I want only to say that we can assert meaningfully that a text can be more or less a text and have more or less coherence. But a text can have so much coherence that one will never confuse it with an ongoing discourse, and will take it as a work. Now (to Prof. Graff) I believe you offered rather an alternative to what I said, and I'm not sure I understood you correctly. But I would say, "Yes, probably." An ordinary written text is written not just in the sense in which a transcript of a tape recording is written, but is written for understanding, for reading. This is the first step toward a special form or art of writing. But there remains a decisive difference between such a written text and what we call a poetical or literary work. That was the line of my argument, if we can accept--and indeed, it's an open question--that it was a good idea of mine to 20 Summary of Discussion</page><page sequence="11">speak about "truth" in this special sense. This was indeed what Professor Graff and Professor Bruns question when they ask, can we speak about truth apart from meaning? Certainly, in a way it is meaningless to do so. But what I tried to demonstrate is that even if we could have complete knowledge about everything through scientific investigation, still it makes no sense to say there is a competition between art---fine art, literary art---and the scientific approach. They are very different forms. But obviously there is something more involved here than pure formalism. And on this point, I think I am much more on your side, Prof. Graff, than you suppose. I am not a formalist at all. I spoke about the non-referential character of art simply because I had to begin with some general, received opinion. But my point was to go beyond this immanentistic, formalistic concept of non-referentiality. My question was, where is there nevertheless a reference? And this reference seems to me not alongside other possible objects, but has to do with the whole of our worldview and of our exposure to ourselves in life. "Being" is not an object--to reformulate Heidegger. Question: What do you mean when you say that all interpretations should "disappear"? Gadamer: The function of interpretation is to learn to read better. I think when we have this common basis for all our efforts, then we have also a common ground for agreement. Would you accept that the purpose of interpretation is to learn to read better? (Yes) What I called "disappearance" is, I think, an experience everybody knows. When we study the discussions about the interpretations of a particular poem and then one day we recur to the text itself, then after a certain sedimentation of all the overdone interpretations-and all interpretation is an overdoing; that is its definition and its function; it must be an overdoing; without that one would not enlighten anything--we begin to regain the balance and find the place of the different remarks and enlightening observations made by scholars, so that in the end, I think, the text begins to "speak," and that means: the text is understood without doubt or alternatives. The interpretation disappears in the sense that we did not unlearn to enjoy the text. Marshall: My question is concerned with the indefinite address of the written text. There is much in this conception to agree with, but I wonder whether this determination might be historically connected. If I think about the modes of discourse up until historically relatively recently, it seems to me that writing was not the normal foundation for the construction of discourse, but rather rhetoric was. And the assumption of rhetoric was that indeed someone was addressed. One of the important divisions of rhetoric has to do with the nature of the audience to which the discourse is addressed--whether it is a judicial body, whether it is a legislative body, whether it is a private or Summary of Discussion 21</page><page sequence="12">occasional audience. And there is in such discourse a built-in sensitivity to particular kinds of audiences. There is hardly in rhetoric, I think, a claim that one could address persons in general on no determinate occasion. There was always a sense of the determinateness of the occasion and the audience. And I wonder whether to a certain extent this possibility of seeing the written text as indeterminately addressed arises with printing. I think of Jonathan Swift, who in The Tale of a Tub is deeply concerned with the influence of printing on various kinds of discourse. And he sees that influence as disastrous, partly because one no longer has a sense of who the audience is, of whom one is addressing. So could I ask about the possible social and historical determi- nants of the idea that a text is not in fact addressed to any particular audience? Gadamer: In my written, though not in my spoken remarks I touched on the oral tradition of poetry. I think it is very interesting to consider the function of epic forms and epic figures of speech, the various poetical resour- ces, which suggest that even oral poetry is on the way toward a text. As to the relationship to rhetoric, that is a tragic history not only in modern, but also in ancient times. Without a special political constitution where free speech and free discussion is asked and demanded, rhetoric falls back on or down to a textual character. The classic rhetors of Greece began to write their speeches, and that was, of course, the decay of rhetoric. You refer to Swift, and I would refer to Tacitus, where we have the well-known claim about the reasons for the corruption and decay of rhetoric after the loss of the Republic and freedom in Rome. So I would say indeed the determinateness of the audience fades away necessarily in the moment in which the medium turns into texts. "Text" means "written or printed text"--printing is not so decisive as Walter Ong and Marshall McLuhan think--and that means, in the end, the audience can no longer be determined by the occasion and by presence, by participa- tion in present, living speech. And my question precisely is how that happened and what must be done so that the written text remains nevertheless a form of communicating and a form of exchange about serious things. So I think that indeterminacy or anonymity of the text's address remains true even in the perspective of historical explanations. No writer, I think, is so modest as to think that he writes just for a limited, contemporary audience. Question: Isn't the idea of its performance necessary to a text? I would say that you cannot dissociate the text from its performance. Gadamer: This question occupies me very much, and again, I touched on it in my written, though not in my spoken remarks. I think that reading is not a form of performance. It is not, to speak philosophically, a form of reproduc- tion. A performance is always the transport into, the re-embodiment in a new matter. Reading is not. On this point, Roman Ingarden said some very good things about the openness of the schemata in a novel: not everything is 22 Summaryt of Discussion</page><page sequence="13">determined, but everything can be filled out by the reader. I might call this the "offer" of the text, but it is very difficult to describe it. I would also say that reading need not be a continuous process. We are interrupted, we resume reading a book, and nevertheless we synthesize it in the end. So the whole temporal structure of reading seems to me very different from the temporal structure of a performance.--In the case of reading and poetry, I think it is correct to speak of what I call "the inner ear." One has in the inner ear how the poetical text is realli' speaking, and no performance can fulfill the expecta- tions of our inner ear. Question: When we speak of truth, should we not distinguish also a truth of universals and a truth of reference? If we follow through consistently on the claim that poetry is "untranslatable," how could we avoid the stronger claim that we never translate from an individual's utterance to the taking up of that utterance by another human being? And then, there would be no communica- tion at all. Gadamer: I think we should distinguish--and I don't think you did sufficiently--between an ordinary text and a literary text. There is no ques- tion that in ordinary life we are on common ground. Therefore, recordings of live speech can be translated quite well. The question is, how is it with a literary text? Even there I would not say that there is no tranlsation, but I would say there exist limitations of translatability. That for me is just an illustration of the fact that in this case the word is not only meaningful, but is also itself presence. And that is my point. I think it is a little too sophisticated to think we are not able to understand one another if we agree that poetry is only in a very derived and secondary sense translatable. Poetical speech is not like the normal form of communication. As a matter of fact, I think only a poet can translate a poem by making a new poem in his own language. Therefore, in some cases of poetical translations, we should not call them translations at all. They are new creations. For example, Stefan George's translations of Baudelaire are no longer Baudelaire, but are excellent George. Suninary' of Discussion 23</page></plain_text>
