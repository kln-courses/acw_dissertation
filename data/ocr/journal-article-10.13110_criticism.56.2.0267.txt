But I am convinced that it is precisely because of a  certain programmatic—others say, neurotic—consistency at the heart of  his queer anarchism that interest in him these days is so great. Intro Jack Smith’s world is rich. It is abundant, overwhelming. What does rich- ness mean? Not only an excess of objects and use values but also plenty of  options for using the objects efficiently and plenty of ways and means of  using them. the actors and performers in Smith’s films constantly pres- ent and perform an abundance of possibilities for using objects. Richness  in this sense also means that each usable object, which is full of possibili- ties, has been taken out of a stream of excess and luxury. there is always  an accessoire, a hat, a feather, or other details of a mask—if you want to  call it a mask—that seems to be completely arbitrary as if it were saying,  for instance, “I am a great, obscure, strange funny hat, but I could also be  another equally absurd, beautiful hat.” But, simultaneously it says, “Be- ware! this is not arbitrary at all. It has to be exactly this hat.” thirdly, it  says, “Where this came from, there are more hats exactly like it.” I have often wondered what is at the core of this rare and contradic- tory impression of mine—namely, that Smith’s world is at the same time  a maximum of disorder and chaos, as well as perfectly organized. When- ever we are presented with the accounts and anecdotes about his endless  performances with their continuous interruptions, about his inability to  Criticism Spring 2014, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp. 267–277.

Nonetheless, it is important  for my narrative that there are two seemingly antagonistic claims to be  dealt with: richness and precision. My point is that there is an economic relation between the two. the  artistic treatment of this relation is central to Smith’s critique of capitalism.  that his work harbors such a critique and that Smith felt—not in a theo- retically or morally mediated way, but directly and immediately—horrified  by capitalism is a fact we know from some of his own writings or from  anecdotes about him. for instance, in Sylvère Lotringer’s 1978 interview  for Semiotext(e), Smith argued that this was a bad name for a magazine.  Lotringer should have called it “hatred of Capitalism” instead.1 (twenty- three years later, Lotringer published Hatred of Capitalism [2001], a book  version of Semiotext(e), in honor of Smith.2) In his performances, there is  a reappearing cast of characters who embody the evils of capitalism, like  Uncle fishhook, and especially the evils of what he calls “landlordism,”  his own word for those evils of capitalism he most specifically abhorred  because they turned everything around him into a “rented world.” We can also try to localize Jack Smith’s anticapitalism in deeper   layers—that is, in the structural framework of his lifelong project. And  that is what I am trying to do here. the first level would address a com- plex of categories that includes concepts of richness, treasure, availabil- ity, use value and, above all, the critique of the commodity. the second  level would refer to the relations among temporal pressure, lack of time,  and real time in the aesthetics of his time-based practices (film and per- formances). this more generally includes the question of the extent to  which Smith interprets his works as finished or finishable. the third  level, finally, would address his relationship to those humans involved  in his  productions—his audiences and his performers—and the degree  to which they could be exchanged for one another or become each other.  Smith’s relation to machines and to objects and their value is included  here, along with, importantly, his relation to the means of production. Volume I: objects, Commodities there is an anticapitalist theory of art implicit in many artistic practices  that identifies the locus of capitalism and the cultural industry aesthetically  </page> <page sequence="3">  JACk SMIth, DAS KApItAl: VoLUMeS I, II, ANd III 269 within the objects, which in this discourse are defined as fetishes. In this  critique, artworks exaggerate or enhance the negation of use value and  the dominance of exchange value in regular commodities until the status  of a fetish is reached, which becomes something like the absolute and re- ligious other of use value. this school of artistic anticapitalist criticism of  art always favors a practice of aesthetic poverty, which either circumvents  objecthood completely or tries to contextualize its objects in such a man- ner that they cannot become auratic and, thus, fetishizable. I do not want  to delve into a considered debate about this school of criticism; I even  have something to say to its defense. I just mention it here because it has  become hegemonic within critical discourses by both artists and writers of  the last four or five decades and has been able to push a practice like Jack  Smith’s to the margin. But, thus far, this contradiction between practices like Conceptual Art,  on one hand, and Smith, the theatre of the Ridiculous, or early yayoi  kusama, on the other—to name just a few of Smith’s and Conceptual- ism’s contemporaries—has rarely been described or theorized. one  reason is that the discussion of Smith has tended to treat him as a per- formance artist or filmmaker rather than as a practitioner in the world  of the fine arts. even when these contradictions were mentioned, they  were almost exclusively debated against the background of a specific his- torical divide—the one between the American high Modernism of the  New york School, on one hand, and the more often than not queer tradi- tion of American Surrealism along the lines of Joseph Cornell, florine  Stettheimer, Pavel tchelitchew, Parker tyler, and Charles henri ford.  Although the juxtaposition of these two sides of a cultural divide has  many merits as historical description, it might be of additional interest to  stress a certain political critique in Smith’s work. Perhaps it makes sense  to say that Smith—naively, if you prefer—wanted to reconstruct the use  value of objects through his work in a completely voluntarist fashion, as  if against all capitalist odds it could be reconstructed. he thought it could  be possible for art to solve a political problem. Richness in his world is again neither the richness of saved or recon- structed use values, nor the richness of commodity fetishes. Smith ac- cepted fetishes. he truly liked the splendor of exchange value. But he  did not like glamour and splendor in the very context of the commod- ity, which is to say, a context that remains silent about the commodity  character of the glamorous commodity and that allows the gaze to be  misdirected, fetishistically, someplace else. Instead, Smith edits the com- modity out of the commodity fetish. he was not only a theorist of garbage  and trash and their aesthetics. he literally picked his favorite objects, his  </page> <page sequence="4"> 270 dIedRICh dIedeRIChSeN props, and costumes out of the garbage. he reactivated energies from ob- jects that had stopped circulating as commodities. Smith, like other artists  who compared the abundance of garbage with the excess of exchange and  surplus value, is interested in the projections and anthropomorphic quali- ties invested in these particular things, these objects. on the other hand,  though, he is not interested all that much, since in his performances he  liberates these very qualities from the objects at the moment when they  are no longer subject to exchange value because they have dropped out of  circulation. Smith is not only a predecessor of those trash methodologies that ap- peared in the music, Super 8, and later video underground of the late  1970s and early 1980s. this aesthetic methodology intentionally tried to  save mistakes—to leave traces of human imperfection or overachieve- ment in the production of especially lower forms of the cultural industry  and, eventually, to fetishize them. Smith additionally constructed a gal- lery of ancestors or, rather—and less patriarchally—goddesses, for him- self out of hollywood and other B movies. he attributed a certain truth  value to the misguided or tragically failed performances of people like  Maria Montez—a truthfulness that could not be delivered by the clean  critique of culture proposed by high Modernism. this truthfulness could  be achieved only by a criticism that had worked its way through love and  disappointment on its way to negation. Maria Montez is not critical, but  she’s also not a purely industrial product. She bears a visible difference  from the industrial product that she was initially meant to be. this differ- ence diverges from that of the sovereign modernist subject, which seems  to be able to comfortably choose its distance from the object of criticism.  this safe critical distance makes that other distance invisible, obscures it  with its false clarity, and cheapens it. It cools down its critical potential to  what you have always known or warms it up to a petit bourgeois struggle  over distinction. But there is another side to the aesthetics of involvement and disap- pointment, of love and hate. It opposes the romanticism of use value in  the ideology of media specificity in modernism with its dogma of an  enlightened, anti-illusionist use of means and media. It does so in part  because the normative anti-illusionism was connected to the general het- eronormativity of high Modernism through, for example, the not-so- far-fetched, shared pseudorationalist idea of normality as the opposite of  illusion. this anti-illusionist rationalism of high Modernism was thus  connected with a project of normality and normativity, which included  heterosexuality, a Protestant regime of discipline, and an historical belief  in technocratic efficiency based on technological progress. this was, of  </page> <page sequence="5">  JACk SMIth, DAS KApItAl: VoLUMeS I, II, ANd III 271 course, not the core of critical modernism, but even critical antimodern- ism was swimming with that flow because it had no means to identify its  difference from these forms of normality. even theodor W. Adorno and  other highly sensitive and skeptical high Modernists who opposed any  regime of normality saw homosexuals as victims of capitalism.3 Queer  and, later, hippie-based antirationalism had a lot in common in the, say,  early to mid-1960s, as you can observe in some of Jack Smith’s so-called  creatures, especially in Normal love (1963), who sometimes look as if they  descended from an album cover of the Incredible String Band. We are  now going to identify two differences between them: 1. the confrontational aspect of those people, who Stefan Brecht in his  1976 book Queer theatre calls free persons, meaning the actors and artists  in the films of Jack Smith and the plays of the Ridiculous theatre, as op- posed to the authoritarian phony, who would be the representative of nor- mality in the mid-1960s.4 hippies were not confrontational in that sense. 2. the source of the antirationalism of the hippies can be found, in  one sense, in a radical antimodernism as represented by esoterics, new  age, archaisms, etc. the queer-surrealist antirationalism is politicized  and thus can rather be understood as a correction of modernist normal- ism, which is based on shared positions with modernism and enlighten- ment thought. In this sense, I’m thinking, for example, of Robert Musil’s  sexual- political drag-multiplication-utopia from 1912, “das geschlecht  vertausendfachenden Unterschied der Persönlichkeiten” (the differ- ence of gender multiplied by the thousand differences of personalities),  which suggests that a radical fulfillment of human emancipation can- not be stopped at two genders or sexes, but should count each individual  position as a specific sexual orientation.5 Particularist confrontation plus  queer universalism make for an unconsoled but productive tension as op- posed to false consolation in historical hippie culture. Volume II: time/Work the economy of time and of lifetime is essential for capitalism. the dis- tinction between the time that the employed laborers works for them- selves and the time they work for the capitalist reinserts the delineation  of the entire day into production and the reproduction of her labor force.  this bipolar structure also reappears in the economies of time within  cultural production. time-based art tries to demark the artificially con- structed separations of time use as natural and to turn them into unchang- ing essentials. this is especially the case for music and feature films, since  </page> <page sequence="6"> 272 dIedRICh dIedeRIChSeN both artistic formats are meant for the periods of reproduction. Just as  loops, on the one hand, and extreme duration, on the other, seem today to  be extremely attractive attacks on this economy of time, especially in the  way it is currently organized as eternal work without reproduction, so  was it important in the 1960s and 1970s to attack the rules of temporality  in daily routines, as well as in artistic formats, as a crucial part of the great  negation of normality. Loop-based and/or phase-shifting minimal music,  endlessly improvising hippie rock but also ultrashort microdramas or  strobe-light shows and films like tony Conrad’s the Flicker (1965), with  their staging of the momentary, all participated in this all-out attack on  temporality. But there was also already work of an extreme slowing down  and duration, the best known, of course, by Andy Warhol. Both War- hol and the best-known director of slowing down, Robert Wilson, credit  Jack Smith as being the first great artist of slowness. By this, they are  not so much referring to the time of reception but to the time of produc- tion. After Flaming Creatures (1963), Smith never finished a work again.  the resistance against conclusion, which is definitely a common thread  in everything he did, does not need to be added as a third category next  to extreme duration and extreme slowness, for one can resist conclusion  already in short pieces. My observation from the introduction was that in Smith’s taste precise  choices were made from a large, rich set of possibilities. this implies a very  specific politics of time and infinity. on one hand, every decision has to  be for good or has to be valid for an unlimited, unforeseeably long stretch  of time. on the other hand, the richness is represented by the equally  imminent futurity of more and other decisions of infinity that linger in  the background waiting to be articulated. every decision is, therefore, for  eternity and relative at the same time. We are in a paradoxical sequence of  eternities, which might not be so different from actual astrophysical and  cosmological correctness. What do we know? finally, whatever happens in Smith’s endless performances is never set  in relation to a normal time span, not only in terms of daily routines but  also in relation to the conventional length of theatrical or musical perfor- mances. None of these peculiarities are the result of a conceptual under- standing of temporality in time-based arts, nor of staged and stylistically  legitimized stretching of the regular lengths of time for performances.  No, all of these slownesses appear as documents of a primary impossibility  to finish an artwork or close performances within the larger framework  of capitalistically organized time. It would be wrong to sacrifice the dig- nity of one decision to the pressure of coming to terms with conventional  temporal order, nor can there be any worthy criterion to accommodate  </page> <page sequence="7">  JACk SMIth, DAS KApItAl: VoLUMeS I, II, ANd III 273 a fit into the sequences of an ordinary day with its needs for breaks and  moments of entertainment. In and through his performances—and that  is what I am mainly discussing here—Smith clearly explained to his audi- ences that the time of art is longer than that of work and leisure together.  But his day, of course, only had twenty-four hours. It was not possible to  reach the twenty-fifth hour, although that was where he aimed to go. the  time he needed was the temporal equivalent of the messianic-like chaotic  richness and abundance of the objects and documents he had collected  in piles. If one were to transform these objects back into the time it took  to make them, including the soul time it took to make them containers  of lifetime and emotional energy, it would result in an infinity—an im- possible infinity—constructed out of human time that capitalist exchange  can not conceptualize.6 Again, there is a second level, whose time relations cannot be explained  as the excess either of the time of art or of the time of art in relation to  the time of life and work: this is the rhythm one finds in Smith’s films.  It is present even when the films are silent or when there is no original  music and the recipients add it through their sonic imaginations based on  the movements of the actors and performers. this soft, rocking groove  of gyrating pelvises and dangling penises often comes from exotic or ex- oticist records, not so different from Smith’s predecessor Joseph Cornell  with his groundbreaking found-footage opus Rose Hobart (1936). Cornell  had selected semi- or pseudo-Brazilian music that was used in the United  States in the 1930s as advertisement for tourism to Rio de Janeiro. the  different hawaiian, South American, and Polynesian musical styles used  in Smith’s films are extremely friendly and don’t force themselves upon  the sitting, listening, and watching bodies of the cinema audience. But  they also offer the dancing body moving along with them a lot of personal  possibilities. they are not challenging. the body does not need to make  an effort; it is taken by the music like a swimmer by the surf or the cur- rent. Like any rhythmic music, it still measures or structures time, but in  a definitely circular way and without leading to a conclusion. It supports  the endlessness of decision making, of never being able to decide for good. Volume III: Men and Machines Smith used technology in his performances—for instance, turntables and  film and slide projectors. he forced or motivated his audience to par- ticipate and to help with several subaltern functions on stage or even, at  times, to perform with or instead of him. According to Mary Woronov,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 274 dIedRICh dIedeRIChSeN among many others, there were performances during whose course the  entire audience was absorbed for hours with technical or artistic jobs and  no passive observer had been left.7 for a while, I pondered situating this  observation in relation to the term “relational aesthetics,” which has been  discussed so widely in the last decade, but I decided against it. the con- temporary perspective on the transformation of an artwork and its par- ticipating audience into a social event that overcomes social separation  by overcoming its aesthetically mediated symptoms aligns itself all too  well with a critical diagnosis of the function of art that was widespread  in the 1960s—namely, its compensatory function. I want to defend Smith  against that critique. Compensatory art not only does injustice to the po- litical reality of the problems it aesthetically solves or silences but also  harms the aesthetic dimensions of such artworks, at least beyond their  sociobureaucratic translatability of action and reaction. Subcultural posi- tions, on the other hand, based on new commonalities and communities of  art and culture, argued instead for noninstrumentalist relations between  politics and art, betting on rather loosely connected coextensive projects.  I assume, though, after all I know and have seen of Smith’s work, that he  was also skeptical about this position. the high-tensioned loneliness of  the one who worked with obsessions and highly invested objects was only  one side of a polarity. the other, of course, was the absurdity of this posi- tion and the sensing of the necessity of not separating any artistic practice  from any social practice. the incompatibility of these two poles cannot be  synthesized or postponed; the artistic, as well as the social practice, must  be constantly related to each other as incompatible. one way to do this,  as mentioned in the last section, is to force both the time of reception and  production beyond any reasonable time necessary for the management of  daily life. to work longer not only than an average workday or average  leisure time but than both combined means at the same time not to work  at all. In order to direct or organize contemporary production based on a di- vision of labor and specialized skills, one deals not only with living labor  but also with machines. Machines function not only to divide work pro- cesses into dignified and undignified human labor processes but also to  introduce standards. they cannot function on their own or in collabora- tion with humans without standards that translate between them. Jack  Smith did not have an agenda in relation to educating machines, nor did  he want to destroy them or have any Luddite ambitions. We can assume  that he was not trying to replace technology with nature but rather to  connect the two in an artificial third space or, better, in a third space of  artificiality in which relations were determined neither by mechanical  </page> <page sequence="9">  JACk SMIth, DAS KApItAl: VoLUMeS I, II, ANd III 275 standards nor by bodily nature. film and slide projectors, as well as turn- tables, responded to his input as if he were giving them a final object,  because external discrete objects are the only possible inputs they know.  thus, they oppose and stand in the way of the fundamental questioning  of socially produced temporality and objecthood in Smith’s work. their  insistence on standardized pitches and clearly defined beginnings and  ends interrupts the tension of impossible, but important, decision mak- ing, on the one hand, and endless postponement, on the other. over and over again, Jack Smith halted the smooth functioning of ma- chines during his performances. for example, he reedited films live and  constantly reorganized his slides. thus he continuously renegotiated—to  put it in more technical terms than it was—the order of preproduction,  production, and postproduction between unique performance and repro- duced screening. I never experienced this live and know of it only from  hearsay, from texts by Brecht and others. I saw Smith perform only once,  in hamburg in 1982, where he presented his stuffed penguin yolanda  and a slide show of partially found, purchased, or self-made images that  was interrupted and reorganized by him several times. Among the found  slides were images by Baron von gloeden, the famous german photogra- pher of beautiful nude boys on the island of Capri, where Smith had been  before he came to hamburg. even this relatively mild form of constant  revision and reconstruction of stage props and stage technology seems,  retrospectively, an early form of a practice that, only later with the au- tonomization of dJ culture and (even later) in some forms of live video  and video scratching, has become normalized. But it is normalized to  completely different ends. Whereas dJing with its attempts to elegantly  smoothen forms of synchronicity and its temporal control of industrially  preproduced objects is about a kind of accommodation to or insertion into  the flow, Smith’s art is about interruption. It is about a reconfiguration of  more basic distinctions and principles of organization, like the order of  making and inhabiting a world, writing and playing of a role, dancing  and choreographing. to unify performing and scriptwriting is the ideal of any aesthetics of  improvisation, but even this ideal would have been too easy an idea for  Smith. he would have preferred to retain all these different roles and hier- archically organized divisions of labor and to fuck with them, mix them  up, and switch them instead of reconciling them in an ideal art form. for,  in the end, this would just have been another attempt at consolation—a  consolation that would end in compensation because that is what happens.  one cannot reconcile (or console) on an artistic level what has never been  an artistic conflict. But the mixing up of the specific elements of divided  </page> <page sequence="10"> 276 dIedRICh dIedeRIChSeN labor is not only an appropriate but also a highly funny practice—a means  that holds every didactic and programmatic ugli ness at a distance. the  unavoidably true but also somehow embarrassing impression in art—in  Smith’s art, as well—that an artist could not have done something he or  she did differently, because he or she is “like that,” is complemented by  the visible fact that each of these fateful decisions arises form the depths  and abundances of a hyper-rich disorder. this indeed offers some mecha- nisms of consolation by gesturing towards life as a depot of objects and  energies, of which there are always more. “I Can’t Work that Way”: this is practically Jack Smith’s mantra,  but with all the nuances you discover by pronouncing it differently. “I  can’t work that way”: I am not controlling it. I am not dominating it.  everything has to be open, but that is equally horrible. “I can’t work that  way”: Not without money. Not with someone else’s money, not under the  dictate of someone else, not if I have to do everything on my own. “I can  work not that way”: Indeed, I am very good at not working, in the sense of  not producing results, not gaining surplus value, never getting anywhere.  But I do this especially well when I am doing something anyway. “I can’t  work that way”: If I consider all the things I know and feel, all the tastes,  smells, and idiosyncrasies that pass through me, this will never be a piece  of work; no one can buy it or use it. “I cannot work that way”: obviously. two Postscripts 1. these paragraphs have been singing the praises of unsolvable problems  and tensions, of naming, addressing, and acting out, but not closing up  or solving the central aporias of working in and with contemporary art.  Such praise always gravitates in an unpleasant proximity to a glorification  that delegates to others—earlier ones, dead ones—those tensions one does  not want to bear oneself. So, one watches others bearing it. however, one  could also view it in this way: If someone configures tensions in his or her  own life in such a way that he or she cannot stand them, it is not beautiful,  but rather a good reason not to act likewise in one’s own life. I am not sure  if this argument can be used against my way of discussing Jack Smith. 2. Normativity is constructed differently today than in Smith’s times.  An unforced, easygoing, open behavior is not only the new norm; it is  the implicit prerequisite for being admitted to a world of earning money,  making a career, and being productive. Some folks do believe that, by  having seemingly more human norms, the problem of normativity it- self has disappeared. this is an error, although it is true that normativity  </page> <page sequence="11">  JACk SMIth, DAS KApItAl: VoLUMeS I, II, ANd III 277 cannot be criticized only as a social form but also by its social content.  Although the social content is of high relevance, in relation to Smith  it is much more important to be able to realize that what is considered  valuable and desirable could also be decided completely differently. our  contemporary normative relaxedness, creativity, and openness cannot be  fought by a return to an old-school normality—something a lot of other  people seem to believe when they invest in a new bourgeoisie—but only  by the constantly increasing radical inventiveness, the super serious, non- relative humor and sarcasm, that Jack Smith was able to mobilize against  any form of molestation by an ugly, rented world owned by landlords.  And here I am not backing off from my heroism. —translated by daniel hendrickson  with Nanna heidenreich and Ulrich Ziemons Diedrich Diederichsen is a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.
