<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Prophetie, by Abraham Heschel, Krakow, Verlag der Polnischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1936, pp. vi +194. Here is an earnest, independent, original, and stimulating-not to say provoking--study of Hebrew prophecy, as represented by the pre-exilic prophets. Not the content or value of the prophets' message but the nature and structure of the prophetic consciousness constitute the object of inves- tigation, and the aim is not to give a detailed description but to determine what is essential and indispensable. Subconscious or unconscious phenomena are deliberately ignored as irrelevant. The author attempts to avoid both Theologismus and Psychologismus; actually he avoids the latter more success- fully than the former. Much comparative material is drawn into the discussion, and the use made of it impresses one as showing both wide reading and sound insight. The documentation, however, suggests reliance upon secondary sources to a considerable degree. The organization of the material is open to criticism. There is a good deal of repetition, and often the argument seems to be travel- ing in circles instead of getting ahead, so that one wonders whether the author has in mind some distinction not apparent to the reader. The style shows extraordinary facility in saying the same thing in different ways, and consider- able ability in effective statement of contrasts. It suffers from a fondness for abstract and compound terms, some apparently coined ad hoc. It must be admitted that the writer is wrestling with large and unwieldy ideas, yet there are times when his treatment brifigs to mind the definition of sociology as "the elaboration of the obvious." The argument may be summarized briefly, though no such summary can do it justice. A comparison at some length with religious ecstasy and with poetic inspiration leads to the conclusion that Hebrew prophecy is essentially</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 399 different from both. The basis of the prophetic experience is found in 'sym- pathy' with the divine 'pathos.' The revelation which the prophets received was not concerned with the nature of God but with his relation to the world characterized by concern for the world and reaction to it. This reaction was marked by a polarity of revulsion and attraction, of wrath and mercy. The wrath predominated, but not as an essential attribute; it was a reaction to man's conduct which could be changed by changing man's conduct, and such a change was the object of the prophetic ministry. The divine reaction to human history was reflected in the prophet's consciousness. The inspiration of the prophet was experienced as an event. Heschel sub- jects the concept 'event' to an exhaustive analysis, with much attention to Wendung and Ricktung. The upshot of it all is that the initiative in the trans- action is God's. Unlike revelation by omens and oracles, prophecy is the result, not of man's turning toward God (Theotropismus), but of God's turning toward man (Anthropotropismus). What 'pathos' is to the content of prophetic inspiration 'anthropotropism' is to its form. True as this is, it might have been said more simply. This portion of the argument in particular would astonish the prophets themselves beyond measure. The purpose of God's turning to the prophet is to make known how he feels about the way men are living, though Heschel does not put it so crudely. The result for the prophet is not knowledge about God's nature but understan- ding of His attitude. This involves a conception of God as different from that of the "Wholly Other" or the "numinous" as it is from pantheism or deism. At this point the discussion becomes definitely apologetic. The conception of the divine 'pathos' comes close to the offense of anthropomorphism which theology has striven desperately to avoid. Heschel insists, however, that it is not a projection of human qualities but an essential and original theological category. It is not a matter of Sosein but of Sobezogensein, not of God's being but of his relation to man. It means that God is concerned with everything: if that were a human quality, says Heschel with a rare touch of irony, anthro- pomorphism would be no blasphemy. What the Bible presents is not an anthropomorphic theology but a theomorphic anthropology. This, of course, merely begs the question, but Heschel's insistence on a realistic recognition of the prophetic idea of God is valid historically. There may even be something in it theologically. Significant from the historical point of view is Heschel's claim that the nineteenth century scheme of development in Hebrew religion from the conception of God as mysterious and fearful to the thought of him as kind</page><page sequence="3">400 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE and loving merely reflects the embarrassment of enlightened theologians at anthropomorphic ideas in the Old Testament, and that the two conceptions actually exhibit the essential polarity of the 'pathetic' character of God. He even undertakes to analyze the presuppositions of the aversion to anthro- pomorphism. Without losing sight of the real development in religion within the Old Testament we may recognize a large measure of truth in this conten- tion. The religion experienced by the prophets, as distinguished from the religion preached by them, was essentially a matter of feeling with God. Heschel distinguishes this 'sympathy' from the 'passion' of the mystery cults and the mystic's imitation of God. The prophet's experience was not an end in itself and could not be reproduced or induced. It was the sharing of specific divine judgments and attitudes, imparted by God for the purpose of changing human history. As may be seen from this summary, Heschel's approach is logical and analytical rather than inductive. Consequently it is not surprising to find a tendency toward schematism and broad generalization. Sometimes, though not often, forced exegesis weakens the argument. A rather dogmatic tone pervades the discussions, and an apologetic interest is sometimes in evidence, particularly in the last part of the book. In spite of these qualities, however, the richness and freshness of thought and the sincerity and thoroughness of the enquiry make the book well worth careful reading, and on the whole the conclusions appear to be sane and sound. Even though the reader some- times becomes impatient, he gains new insights. MILLAR BURROWS</page></plain_text>
