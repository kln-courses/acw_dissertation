JULLIAN'S first volume of lectures, intro- ductory to a study of Celtic and Roman Gaul, was reviewed in C.R. XLIV., p. 205. The second volume sustains throughout an elaborate vindication of Nationality and an uncompromis- ing condemnation of Imperialism, ancient and modern. The first five lectures, which were delivered during the war, refer in no measured terms to contemporary realities (cf. review in Rev. Et. anc., January-March, 1931, p. 89). But we turn to Gaul. After emphasising the antiquity of national consciousness in Gaul, as attested by literary and archaeological evidence, M. Jullian pro- ceeds to combat the orthodox view that the loss of Gallic independence before the advance of Roman Imperialism was inevitable; through internal disunion and fratricidal feud the Gauls brought (otherwise avoidable ?) destruction upon themselves. While Romanisation, or more truly 'la conversion du monde a l'Hellenisme,' intro- duced into Gaul the alphabet and script, re- presentational art, religious anthropomorphism, lapidary construction, and coinage, yet the lack of these cultural devices in pre-Roman Gaul in no way disproves the existence of civilisation among the Celts. Civilisation may exist with- out culture; and M. Jullian protests strongly against 'cette idWe injuste et dangereuse que culture et civilisation sont choses pareilles et solides.' Civilisation is the 'puissance de l'Ame en esprit et en morale,' and culture ' l'ensemble des modalit6s par lesquelles cette Ame traduit et transmet ses pensees' (p. 217). The mere- tricious majesty of the Roman Empire is not admired by M. Jullian. 'L'Hellinisme a 6te la lumiere du monde antique.' The sole justifica- tion of an empire lies in the fulfilment of its moral obligation 'preparer des civilisations affaiblies a recouvrer une nouvelle vie.' But the dull monotony of standardised existence under the Roman Imperial system crushed individual national aspirations, so that 'cet ouvrage de fondre des patries, I'Empire Romain s'y est montr' impuissant.' This enthusiastic eulogy of the 'culte de la patrie,' presented in a style both eloquent and lucid, is recommended to all who are interested in the life of ancient Gaul.</page><page sequence="2">44 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW In his third and last volume M. Jullian devotes the first two lectures to a defence of military history (cf. Aev. El. anc., April-June, 1931, p. 194) and a consideration of 'la valeur morale de l'histoire.' Then follows a survey of the material culture, 'tout le confort de la vie moderne,' of Romanised Gaul, succeeded in turn by an analysis of the emotional significance of its arts and crafts, and a rapid but penetrating glance at ancient magical and religious sym- bolism. Turning to ' la vertu du Christianisme,' M. Jullian asserts the importance of the episco- pate in early French history, and remarks that its functions were analogous to those of the Druids. The maladministration of the Empire is illustrated by the events contingent on the arrest of St. Paul and Pliny's governorship of Bithynia (pp. 158-6o). 'Jamais la France ne fut plus malheureuse que sous des empereurs romains' (p. 50o). The last lecture, on 'les forces 'ternelles de la Gaule,' emphasises the survival of the Gallic 'civitates' in the early Christian dioceses and in the modern depart- ments (approximately), 'le phinomene le plus surprenant de notre histoire.' In conclusion, we would affirm that these three inspiriting volumes of introductory lectures covering a period of twenty-five years are a further eloquent evidence of the work of a great historian.
