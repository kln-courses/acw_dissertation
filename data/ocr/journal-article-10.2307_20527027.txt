<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 649 ) THE NEW KORAN. BY REV. MICHAEL O'FERRALL, S. J. Are these the pompous tidings ye proclaim, Lights of the world, and demigods of Fame ? Then bind the palm thy Sage's brow to suit, Of blasted leaf, and death-distilling fruit! Ah! me! the laurelled leaf that Murder rears, Blood-nursed and watered by the widow's tears, Seems not so foul, so tainted and so dread As waves the night-shade round the Skeptic head. Pleasures of Hope, Part I. I'HE faith preached by Aiahomet was compounded, as Gibbon tells us, of two dog,mas, "the one an eternal truth, the other a necessary fiction-There 2s no God but one God, and Mahomet zs his prophet." The Koran, or book lately made pub lic by Professor Tyndall, and later still revised by himself, is, in like manner, compounded of two dogmas: the one the denial of an eternal truth, the other the assertion of a fiction. " There is no God but Matter," says the President of the British Association, "c and Tyndall is its Prophet."` Which of the two Korans contains the larger amount of truth is a question that after ages may decide. The scale, wve think, will incline in favour of the Arabian prophet, at least as soon as time shall have done its Nvork, and the disciple of Epicurus and Lange, t vacating the chair of the British Association, shall have lost some what of his charms and melted into the " azure of the past." Our reason for this belief is as follows. The message of the Arabian prophet recognises at least one truth-what Gibbon styles "ain eternal truth," to wit, the existence of a living God, while the Pre sident of the British Association denies or impeaches that one truth, and puts before us in support of such denial a multitude of errors, misstatements, and sophisms, designed, ve suppose, to win their way as credentials of the prophet Tyndall. We must be fair to the Professor. In the earlier portion of his address we recognise with joy one just statement. It bears the impress of a thinking mind, and may be credited with entire cor rectness. It regards the great Sir Isaac Newton, and is to the effect that the mathematical and physical researches of that illus * A Liverpool journal rightly reduces Professor TyndalTs address to the above formula. f We consider we have done Mr. Tyndallno wrong in styling him the disciple of Epicurus and o? Lange. He admits, indeed, the mastery of both over his studies and his views. Nay, he glories in it. Our readers know who Epicurus was. Lange is known to Germans, and a few Englishmen by his Geschichte des Materialismus (1862). Of the abject views and untrustworthy narrative of this writer we shall have abundant instances as we proceed.</page><page sequence="2">650 The New Koran. trious individual unfitted rather than fitted him for the study of history and divinity. "ThLus," says Professor Tyndall, "4theolo gians have been forgetful of the fact that the very devotion of his (Newton's) powers through all the best years of his life to a totally different class of ideas (not to speak of any natural disqualification), tended to render him less, instead of more competent to deal with theological and historic questions." We believe this statement to be objectively true. We believe it to be true as regards Newton; and it can be no disparagement to the high powers of Mr. Tyndall and his justly-acquired fame in the field of mechanical and physical research, if we generalize his own dictum, and apply it to Mr. Tyndall himself. We do so with all respect for the author of the " Lectures on HIeat, Light, and Magnetism." We challenge his competency to deal in anv manner whatsoever with questions of theology, ethics, mental philosophy, free-will or human destiny. We findin the address before us humiliating proofs that an able exponent of some phe nomena in the domain of physics may be a child (or less than a child) in history, logic, and the higher questions of philosophy those, we mean, that touch on existence, causation, responsibility, the duty of man, and its source, and altogether on the wvorld of nature, as embracing a complete intelligible scheme, self-sufficient and independent of any other. We are far from implying that Professor Tyndall's address con tains nothing whatever that is true. The address, especially the second edition which is now before us, toned down and modified as it is, would refute such an assertion. What we contend is, that neither in the double motto pre fixed to the last edition, nor in the address itself, as it originally stood, or as it has come forth from the press of Longmanss; neither in the presentation of the tenets of such persons as may be deemed Mr. Tyndall's adversaries, nor in the biographical sketches of his friends and the statement of their views, nor yet in attempts at inductive generalization and logical analysis, has Mr. Tyndall given forth any statement that does not err wholly or in part, by misstatement of fact, by omission of modifyino and limiting facts, or lastly, by misapplication both of assumed principle and of fact, and by undue inference from both. The plain oratorl of our immortal bard was content in a critical situa tion to " speak right on." In considering Mr. Tyndall's pamphlet, wve shall imitate the example. We shall begin at the beginning, and challenge the errors, and unweave the sophistries of Mr. Tyn dall " right on " as they occur. On the reverse side of the title page to the second edition of the Address the eye lights on two extracts. They are intended as mottoes or abbreviations of Mr. Tyndall's whole theory. * Mark Anthony.</page><page sequence="3">The New Koran. 651 Some intelligent atoms "self-moved," we suppose, and "self posited," would appear to have come into Mr. Tyndall's "gan glions "' between the dates of the first and second issues of his Address. The texts are, at least, wanting in the first edition. They are paraded in staring type and commanding position in the second. The first of these is from Xenophanes of Colophon. The tenets of this ancient philosopher are set forth to us with sufficient clearness by Diogenes Lalrtius in his lives of the philosophers (See Bohn's Class. Lib.), and by Cicero in his Lucullus. Mr. Tyndall is not accustomed to consult ancient writers. His " luminiferous ether" does not vibrate so far. His early instructors were deficient in this point. They taught the future Prophet of MIatter no more, as he himself tells us, than English grammar and scraps of Chil lingworth against the " Romanists." He is content, therefore, to take the opinions of his ancient demigods at second hand-as v. g. from Lange, Hume, and Dr. Draper, of New York. Under the influence of this amiable weakness he is content to read Xenophanes' maxims and gather the meaning of that archaic -worthy from the fresh letter-press of the author of " Supernatural Relztion."t We beg Mr. Tyndall to bear in mind that the two first hexameters of Xenophanes, reported by St. Clement of Alexandria and approved by him, express simply what every Christian and every theist believes of the true God. They may, therefore, set at rest all the apprehensions of Mr. Tyndall as to the charge of anthropomor phism against those who believe in a personal God. The remain ing lines, being, the satire of a pagan sage against the pagan poets Homer and Hesiod, concern us little. They may, indeed, excite pity for the anachronism of taste visible in a man who, in the nineteenth century, would adopt those lines as motto to a scientific book. * See Mr. TyndaU's Address, where the author speaks of the "nascent poetic thrill in the ganglions " of Mr. Herbert Spencer. We borrow with all reverence the sublime phraseology of the New Koran. f The theory of evolution is curiously illustrated in the two mottoes that adorn the first pages of TyndalTs (revised) Address. A certain unnamed, but able, writer published about three months ago an attack on the Christian Religion under the title of Supernatural Religion. The chief exponents of Christian dogmas in the view of this author, are Mr. Mansel, Bampton Lecturer, and his successor, Mr. Moseley. The latter is made to say {falsely if " Supernatural Religion" copies aright) that we must by moral consciousness conceive of personality in God as a limitation. The author of Supernatural Religion derives from this false admission some hard in ferences, and oratorically concludes by saying : "It almost makes me exclaim with Bacon, It were better to have no opinion at all of God than such a one as is unworthy of Him," &amp;c. Tyndall lights on this, p. 74. He drops the qualifying particle " almost," adopts the statement absolutely, erects it into a motto, and fastens it on the first page of his great Book to instruct Europe on high ques tions of Divinity. The anthropomorphism charge is borrowed from the same source. This truly is evolution from a monad to a monkey, and then to a man. This will not do in criticism nor in history.</page><page sequence="4">652 h/c New Kloran. It is worth while, however, to ascertain more fully the tenets of the man from whom the motto is taken. These somewhat resembled those of Mr. Tyndall as regarded theology-that is, Xenophanes was a Pantheistic Materialist. He held the substance of God to be spherical, or, as Cicero words it, conglobata figura ! As regards the soul of man, he moved a step in advance of AIr. Tyndall, and maintained the human soul to be spiritual.* He maintained all things that exist to be one and imn3utable, and that one and im mutable thing, he held to be God. "Cic. in Lucul. Brucker's Hist. Philos. in vit. Xenoph." In physics, Xenophanes did not quite agree with Mr. Tyndall. Not having been addressed by the President of the British Associa tion, that fantastic philosopher maintained " that there is in nature nlo real producztion, decay, or chanzge; that there are four elements; that the stars arise from vapours, which are extinguished by day and ignited by night ;t that the sun consists of fiery particles collected by humid exhalations, and daily irnezved; that the course of the sun is rectdzlnear; and appears curvilinear only from its great dis tance; that there are as many suns as there are different climates of the earth ; that the moon is an zinhabited world," &amp;-c. The advocate of such theories is the " demigod of fame," whose hexameters Mr. Tyndall makes use of to supplement the Belfast Address, and under whose auspices he essays to abolish the Creator of thin,s and the future existence of man, and to chant the mate rialist's song "low each sage atom laughs at me, Who think a clod inferior to a mian." AMr. Tyndall's address (second edition) is graced with another motto. It is, as we have before stated, from the illustrious Bacon. It seems to be taken from the apophthegms of that famous vriter, and states that in his idea " it is better to have no opinion of God at all than such an opinion as is unworthy of Ihim." The dic?-tu is intenided to serve bothi as a shield and sword-a shield to defend Mr. Tyndall, and a sword to smite his opponents. We observe, however, that whatever may have been Lord Bacon's merits or de merits as a casuist, and wvhether his Lordship held blasphemy or atheism to be the greater sin, no wvriter on systems or sciences ever set forth more clearly than he the " fatuity" and the " madness," as he terms it, of him who asserts or believes that God exists not. To Mr. Tyndall's special attention we commend the entire medziValo of Lord Bacoin, wlhich is entitled Dc Alhzeis7mo. For readers at large we crave permission to insert its last paragraph. It is designed for those wvho are engaged in researches of Natural Philosophy. "Thirdly," says his Lordlship, " with regard to physical inquiries, * Br?ck., ?? Hist. Crit.

Wherefore," continues the wisest of mankind, "Atheism on all poi2nts appears to be convicted of folly and ignorance, so that it is deservedly called the utterance of insane men." XVith this brief commentary of Bacon himself we have no objection to dismiss the second motto of Mr. Tyndall's revised Address. Mr. Tyndall's preface is moderate, and of moderate length. It informs us of some slight changes made in the new edition of the Address. These are generally for the better-that is for the diminution of the evil. The unexpected amount of criticism of which%the author complains, issuing, as it did, from every intelli gent publicist in Ireland, Great Britain, and America- made the strong man quail, and modify or withdraw his more offensive state ments. The Address, he tells us, was written under some disad vantaghs among the Alps-Lange and Dr. Draper, we suppose, being the only guides. The circumstances will in some measure account for the strange amount of error and, we must say, auda cious misstatement on which we are now about to comment. THE ADDRESS. The President of the British Association leads off his Address with a sonorous but rather needless truism. "An impulse inherent in primeval man turned his thoughts betimes towards the sources of natural phenomena.... The same impulse is the spur of scientific action to-day."t Man, that is to say, acted in ages past because he was so inclined; man acts and inquires to-day because he is so inclined. This is the child's reason for everything he does. We do not question that man acts ofttimes from the same motive as the child. Simple, howvever, and sterile as the statement appears, it suggests to a thoughtful mind inquiries which are of high inte rest, the answers to which are destruLctive of Tvndall's wvhole theory. The inherent impulse to refer events to their causes is known by phi losophers as the pn?czj5le of causality. The tendency is a fact or phenomenon of the huiman mind, manifest in every individual and in all circumstances ; and if facts ought to be referred, as Mr. Tyndall assures us they ought, "to causes congruent with them," + then we may ask what molecule of matter, be it angular or round, be it carbonorhydrogen, be it calcium or potassium, possesses and carries Thereis one exception, "The London Enquirer." The eulogies of that journal on the so-called atomic theory, are considered by Dr. Watts in his " Ireni cum." f Address, p. i. X Address, p. 2. VOL. II. 2 X</page><page sequence="6">654 TIlze New Koranv. with it as its natural propertv this restless tendency to ask w4y-this tendency to knozv things by thezr causes ? Experiment has failed to find, either in the primary or the secondary qualities of matter, any congruent and adequate cause of this princile of causality, any more than it can account for a wise system of legislation or politics by the inherent qualities of a particle of calcium or carbon. The cause would be both incongruous and inadequate to the effect. Human reason recoils before such hypothesis. The professor is farther in fault in this utterance. He narrows unduly the range of the principle of causality. He extends it only to what he calls phy sical phenomena. It reaches, however, to all phenomena, of what ever order, and in ascending the series of Nature's progression the principle of causality refuses to stop where Professor Tyndall would have it stop-at the threshold of the first cause. The question asking impulse, in fact, spurns all bars to its exercise, and Tyndall and his compeers are the only aspirants to Science who now-a-days seek to arrest human thought in its mid career-just there where its exercise is noblest and most necessary-at the threshold of the First Cause. The anthropomorphism charged upon early polytheists, as well as, indeed, upon the monotheist of modern and Christian days, would be simply unaccountable, had Professor Tyndall made any advance in the Philosophy of History as he has done in the Philosophv of Nature. We believe the Professor attaches no clear idea to the word an thropomorphism. It means " having the shape, form, and physical outlines of man." To charge Christians or Jewvs with literally as cribing human shape to the God they worship, wNere a simple and unbearable calucmny. Every Christian, from Clement of Alexandria to Petavius, and every Jewish writer, from Samuel to Maimonides, furnishes a refutation of such slander; and if, in the early books of Moses, from the povertv of Oriental speech, a few expressions are employed regarding the Deity, avOpwwroraOwv9-i. e. ascribing to Him human emotions, the maximn has always prevailed among Christians and Jews that such expressions are to be understood ecowrpcrww-i. e. in a manner becoming the infinite majesty of God. How far the pagans of old were chargeable with the sin of anthro pomorphism it is beside our purpose to inquire. We beg, however, to assure Professor Tyndall, in the words of the eloquent Dr. Watts, that neither Democritus, nor Epicurus, nor Lucretius, with all their atomism made the least advance towards banishing from the popu lace of Greece and Rome the crowd of invisible, and oftentimes anthropomorphic gods. That boon to philosophers and to man kind is due alone to the founders of the Christian religion. When the great apostle of the Gentiles visited the arena, illuminated by these physical and metaphysical speculators, he found the city given to idolatry. He found those speculators, in fact, 'where we now find ProfessorTyndall, standingbefore the record of their own ignorance,</page><page sequence="7">The New Koran. 655 proclaiming to the world that to them God was unknown. They would say, as the present head of the British Association expresses it-the question who made the starry heavens " still remains unanswered, and science makes no attempt to answer it." (" Frag ments of Science," p. 93.)'$ In truth, however, the polytheism of pagans was not so especiallv anthropomorphzc as Tyndall imagines. It was, that we may indulge the Professor with his favourite Greek words, of the zooduowphic type."t Deities were worshipped under every living form-that of the snake, the bull, the elephant, the ape, the frog. As to the nzumina magna, the mighty deities of the hieathen world, they were precisely of that kind which Tyndali, Lange, and others of their school now worship. They were not anthropomorphic, but anmor phic, that is of the cosmic and chaotic kirid. For the Latin race Virgil, in his sixth book of the Eneid, is sufficient witness: "Know first that heaven and earth's compacted frame And flowing waters, and the starry flame, And both the radiant lights, one common soul Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole. This active mind infused through all the space, Unzitesand minizgles with the mighty mass." The cosmogony of the Greeks, as set forth by the Hesiod, be gins with Nzght, whose first descendant is an Egg. Democritus is credited by Lord Bacon with having understood. this cosmogony better than any other philosopher. We may venture. however, to en roll the President of the British Association along with Democritus. The elder deities in this system were not anthropomorphic, i. e. of human figure, but of the atomic, and subsequently of the ornitho logical kind. Some colour is given by this cosmogony to the claim which the birds in Aristophanes? put forth as being deities older than Jupiter. Tyndall and Herbert Spencer will endorse the claim, and the ornithology of Mr. Huxley must be ennobled by it. As to the Buddhist cosmogony, Dr. Draper, the American oracle of 1fr. Tyndall, professes to be an unimpeachable authority on the point. He tells us that the early Buddhists ascended in their account of things to the sublime idea of eternal forces, dis joined from all substance, and existing, like Professor Tyndall's theories, independent of any basis.Ii * Dr. Watts' reply to Tyndall. f We beg pardon for the introduction of this new word. It is supplemental, however, to Professor Tyndall's anthropomorphic. It means having the shape of organic living thing. { Principio ccelum ac terras camposque ; liquentes Lucentemque globum Luna?, Titaniaque astra Spiritus intus alit ; totamque infusa per artus Mens agit?t molem, et magno se corpore miscet. \ See Aristophanes' Birds, Act I., 2. || See Draper's i( Intellectual Development of Europe." 2X2</page><page sequence="8">656 The Ncw Koran. Thiis certainly approaches much nearer to the " self-posited" and " self-moved " atoms of President Tyndall than it does to any system of early Divinities, anthropomorphous or other. The real origin of polytheism may be seen discussed at length in Petavius,* when Professor Tyndall has leisure to consult that invaluable work. Hume, whom alone the Professor quotes, and whom alone the Professor has read in all probability, is, as Mr. Smyth of Aberdeen observes,t opposed to the Professor on the very point he quotes him to support. If the Professor, however, spurns the evidences of history, and seeks to account for the notion of a personal God (or gods it may be) from psychological and empirical reasons, he should not fall back on the relation of mere proximityf as the cause of the sin in question. He should, unless he spurnediust analysis as well as history, have reasoned somewhat thus. If men in early ages gave attention to any facts, they must have noticed not only facts that lay " close to themselves," but those facts which transpired zn themselves. Whatever forces they may have observed impartinIg (transmitting) motion in the world around them, one force only did they or could they observe as orn,finaIing motion. That force lay within themselves. It lay in what is called the wvill-for the most part in theft-ee wYll of each and every observer. It witnessed itself perpetually to him. Others, without exception, bore witness to its operation in themselves. This phenomenon was personal volition-the acts of the human will. Outward forces conzmuntcated motion, this inward force cautsed it. Ten thousand instances vouched the fact, and induction extended the law of "the orzgina/ion of material phenomena from mind as its first source" to other being or beings than himself-to cosmic as well as to terrestrial pheno mena. Thus early human induction proceeded upwards. Pan theistic induction proceeds downwards, and " passing beyond the boundary of observation and experiment," worships in unseen enti ties " a potency and promise," admitted to be out of all analogy with what we know of Nature. Is the modern Pantheist, at the bar of reason, more logical than the ancient pagan who, from the phe nomena of mind, inferred that mind in one or more entities ruled nature's course and presided over all her movements ? Of the two, the Pantheist is certainly the less logical. The historical sketch of eminent atomists xvhich the Professor borrows from the German Lange,? is pronounced by two com petent authorities as " unaccountable, narrow, inaccurate, and defective; neither more nor less than an undiscriminating and uncritical summary of the usual handbooks of the philosophy of the Greeks."II Every moderately informed critic will endorse this * " Dogrn.

A specimen or two of the Professor's history-writing among the Alps wvill not be without interest.i The two leading oracles of the atomic systemt among the ancients are, according to Mr. Tyndall, Democritus and Empe docles. After bepraising the first in a manner neither in accordance with the modern manuals of Brucker and Tennemann, nor with the older notices of Aristotle,t Diogenes Laertius, &amp;c., &amp;c., the Professor introduces Empedocles as observing " a gap (the adjust ment of the'soul with the body) in the philosophy of Democritus," and importing (in order to fill it up) the doctrine now known as "' survival of the fittest."? The adequacy of this doctrine to fill up the Democritic gap is not quite evident, but the Professor must have strange notions of time and successioln when he makes Em pedocles follower to his hero Democritus. Every manual of history, save that, perhaps, of the " excellent!" Lange, places Empedocles before not after Democritus. Neno phanes of Colophon, whom Tyndall ostentatiously marks as living Coo years B.c., lived and spoke with Empedocles (see Diog. Laert. in vita Xenoph.) long before the year B.C. 460, the date of the birth of Democritus. The vision of Empedocles must have been keen in deed to detect " gaps" in the then unborn philosophy of Democritus. It is not true, as Tyndall asserts, tlhat Bacon preferred, in the main, any of the ancient philosophers to Plato andAristotle.jj He calls the atomic views of Democritus "a narrow and inadequate view of things." (Works, vol. ii., p. 7 I 3, Ed. Bohn, 185 I). It is not true that the principles enunciated byDemnocritus werethepeculiarproperty of that philosopher, nor is it true (if we credit so competent a wvitness as Aristotle Be Anz?ia) that Democritus barely asserted the sub stance of the soul to be like fire (as Tyndall, to cover his hero's blemishes, represents it). But it is true that he represented the human soul as consistincg of genzuine substantial fire.? * Among the "unaccountable" blemishes in Tyndall's Sketch so justly com plained of by Dr. Watts, not the least unaccountable is that the Professor nowhere tells us what atoms are, or what he means by the word atom. Are atoms such entities as are proved by experiment, or are they beings inferred by reason ? Are they the same as the monads of Leibnitz, or the minims of Bruno, or the corpuscles of Newton, or ?ie points of Boscovich, or the molecules of modern analysts ? The fact is the so-called atomic system or systems of Tyndall's ancient and mediaeval worthies had no more likeness to what we now call the atomic theory (i. e. Dal ton's " Law of the Combining Proportions of Matter" ) than an egg has to an elephant, or a triangle to a trumpet. The Professor must know this. f Brucker, Tennemann, and the English Cyclopedia place Empedocles at the zenith of his philosophic fame when Democritus, whom Tyndall puts down as his predecessor, was just ten years old !

When directed upon the field of history, the Professor's optic instrument is at fault; its range is scanty, its lens by no means achromatic. As he advances, however, to Epicurus and Lucretius he finds more congenial companions, persons whom he better un derstands.' Yet he fails to notice that by the expulsion of religious fear and the introduction of sensualism in its stead, those illustrious atomists degraded instead of elevating mankind-that the seething decomposition of society, so graphically described by Juvenal, and so fully admitted by the Professor, prevailed after and zn consequence of the lewd and reckless teachings of those writers. The Professor conducts his historical sketch onwards. The middle ages are, of course, as to the atomic theory, a blank and so were all the Christian centuries from the year one of our Lord to the days of Giordano Bruno. One would ask, Is the Professor utterly unaware of the controversies excited among the early Chris tians on the subject of creation-viz., whether God made things from non-existence or from atoms? t Did he never read in his early days of controversy in Ireland of the stoicheia (elements, monads, atoms), of the iAX of the Greeks, and the materia primia el informins of the Romans ? The truth is, the ideas and the names of what we now call atoms were as prevalent among Fathers and Schoolmen as among the followers of Epicurus. There was a dif ference, however. Neither one class nor the other were champions of experiment. They knew not the microscope of to-day. Other instruments of precision were equally wanting. In this not enviable position the pagan philosopher rushed with blind unscientific haste into guesses and ludicrous hypotheses, while the Chris tian writers were content to remain within the limits of Divine teaching- and ascertained facts. One ray of ligrht, according to our Professor, irradiated Christendom during the dreary mil lennium of the middle ages. It broke from the Saracens of the south. So the President of the British Association informs us; taking occasion thence to endorse the special fancy of his friend Dr. Draper, of New York, and to illuminate a page or more of his estimable Address with an apotheosis of the Saracenic race. Lord Bacon, who was acquainted with the Mahomedan exploits in science quite- as well as Dr. Draper, differed in this point from Dr. Draper and from his copyist Professor Tyndall. In We mean nothing uncourteous by this expression. Were we disposed, how ever, to look into the future and prophesy, as the Professor unsparingly does, we should be compelled to draw from the fate of Lucretius and his admirers a gloomy foreboding as to the future of the esteemed Professor. Lucretius put an end to his own life. His translator, Thomas Creech, hanged himself in his room at Oxford. "Watson, his other translator and admirer, was sentenced to death for wife-murder. We hope and trust that Professor Tyndall does not ad vocate this mode of solving the " mystery of life." f The words aroixsta, ?ro^toi, ?Xr? were quite favourites with the early Gnostics and the Fathers of the Church deal largely in their use.</page><page sequence="11">The New Koran. 659 the ATovum Organum (ch. LXXI.) he states his estimate of Saracenic services to science, " For what the Roman writers, ' or the Arabian, or modern' (not including Mr. Tyndall, we supp ose) " have done for science is not much, or of great value." We wonder Mr. Tyndall does not, out of love for Dr. Draper, turn aside from the course of his Address to bepraise the enlightened philosophy of the Buddhists.* For this omission atonement is made by the extravagant eulogy be stowed on Giordano Bruno. The eulogy is hardly deserved. The erratic and unfortunate man Bruno was a believer, as his extant works attest, in the most ridiculous conceits. He contended that the planets were lizving bezngs and deities (animali grandi e numi), "1 He was," to sum up his character in the words of Blakey (Hist. Phil. Mind, vol. ii., p. 145), " a man of rare and splendid talents, but his mind was unequally balanced. He is far removed from the sober and severe realities of life. The portion of solid knowledge we derive from him is scanty; and the contemplation of his intel lectual character and fate leaves a melancholy reflection that what is brilliant is not always useful; nor are the most splendid gifts of the mind a security against error and misfortune." (See also Hallam's notice of Bruno, Lit. Mfiddle Ages; also Maurice's Modern Philos., p. 163; and Bruno's works, edited by Bartho lomew, Paris, 1847). Such is the man that, next to Democritus and Lucretius, com mands the intellectual approbation and sympathy of Mr. Tyndall. Gassendi, flume, and Clerk Maxwell are next mentioned and dis senited from only as much as they admit an intelligent Creator as the cause of things. The same may be said of Charles Darwin, whose admission of a Creator and creative acts in his " Origin of Species "t gives manifest offence to our Professor. Bishop Butler is introduced in an imaginary dialogue with a Lucretian philoso pher, only to have his argument broken off when at the point of triumph, and the awkward and untenable doctrine of the survival of the souls of brutes fathered upon and accepted by his lordship as a necessary consequence from the doctrine that the human soul is immortal! Such is the travesty of men and facts, the unhistorical sketch with which the President of the British Association preludes to the message of death, which under the name of Science he felt himself accredited to deliver at Belfast. He speaks untruly when he boasts the commission of science to deliver that mes sage; and accordingly, like a man conscious of unmeet designs against his race, he endeavours to destroy little by little the great aspirations that are the Natur-al Gospel of the human soul, and by which man is, as Bacon styles him, interpres el minister naturw, the minister and interpreter of nature.

His parody of history has delayed us too long. We shall pass in our next paper to examine his scientific system, that is to say his unscientific and unphilosophical view of things. The observation we wish to make is this, that if Profes sessor Tyndall's view of things-his theory of life, death, man's origrin, and the origin of this universe-were demonstrably true, the President of the British Association, charged to deliver that mes sage, should have flung down the volume and resumed his seat in tears. He might have meditated a little on the words of the poet Campbell "Yet if such Voice the note of thunder roll'd, And that were truewhich Natutre niever told, Let Wisdom smile not on her conquered field. No rapture dawns, no treasure is revealed. Oh, let her read, nor louwdly nor elate, The doom that bars us from a better fate, But sad as angels for a good man's sin, Weep to record, and blush to give it in." President Tyndall is not such a man. No " compunctious visit ing of Nature " ever troubles the repose of the Prophet of Nihilism, or reclaims him for a moment to humanity. His " ganglions " are never the seat, to use his owvn expression, of "a nascent poetic thrill," or of a sentiment of loyalty to his race. Constructing a sys tem of historical and critical fallacy, as we have seen, and of logical and theolog-ical fallacy, as we shall see in our next number, this "veiled prophet" of destruction writes over the portals of his temple " Lasciate ogni speranza o voi ch' entrate," "Leave hope behind all you who enter in" (Dante, "Inferno.") and no thought of the ruin he works comes upon him. In the pre face to the revised edition of his Address he tells us that his Athe Address, p. 4 ; first edition. f The conduct of President Thiers before the French Assembly might have taught President Tyndall some " ethical harmonies," and shown him how to act if by stern necessity he is ever forced to annoance the ruin of his countiy, or sound the death-knell of his race. He would learn from him to fling down the parch ment and listen in tears while the hard message was read by other lips.</page><page sequence="13">The Necw Koran. 66I istic or Pantheistic creed vanishes in his "moments of strength," and recurs, as we should say like a sick man's dream, only in his "imoments of wveakness." The responsibility-if the Professor admits moral science as a branch of kinowledge, we should say the crbne-of giving forth to the world, from a high place, the product of his " moments of weakness," and giving- them forth not as con jectures, but as doctrine, beggars expression and passes calcula tion. Some new symbol or character must be devised, for human language has none adequate, to express the "incongruity," i. e. the moral turpitude, of flinging broadcast upon the world all the amassed errors and destructive sophistries that have come forth from the worst of schools, and doing this without subjective con viction as to their truth, and in opposition to the instincts, feel ings, and hopes of human kind. The author of what we designate as the " New Koran" has adventured this-with what success we have partly seen in the foregoing pages. A few pages in our next number shall complete the inquiry.</page></plain_text>
