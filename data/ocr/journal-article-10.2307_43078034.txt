<plain_text><page sequence="1">312 The Guardians of the Gate in the Akkadian Period E. Douglas Van Buren - Rome At quite an early period the greater gods of the Sumerian pantheon were thought of as being each one the head of a family or group composed of his wife, his sons and daughters, and numerous subservient divinities who acted as grand chamberlain, butler, master of the stables, superintendant of the flocks and herds, or in some other official capacity (4). Among these retainers were the Guardians of the Gate whose duty it was to guard the portals of the divine abode, to drive away any hostile force which might seek to penetrate into the sanctuary, and to introduce into the presence of their overlord those applicants who sought admission for a rightful purpose. Little is known about the guardians and their duties, but they seem to have belonged to a special group of divine twins known as talîmê (2). The office was one of great responsibility and was considered an honourable one, for the guardians were sometimes the sons of the divinity whom they served. The names of six pairs are known : 1) Lugalgirra and Meslam taea (3) ; 2) Lú-làl and Latarak(4); 3) Dumuzi and N i n g i z z i d a (5) ; 4) Kettu and Mēšaru (6) ; 5) Girru ( Gibi l) and Nusku (7) ; 6) Gilgameš and Enkidu (8).

Lugalgirra and Mešlamtaea, the 4 Great Twins', were known by the alternative names of Almu, Alamu or Birdu, and Sarrapu, and also as Mašmaš-Maštabba (2). They were acclaimed as " first-born of Anu " (3). They were assimilated to Nergal, and seem to have been warrior gods who are portrayed fully armed on a fine chalcedony amulet now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (4). Meslamtaea seems to have had a temple at Adab where he received offerings (5), Gudea erected a temple to him in Lagaš, and Šulgi another in Kutha which became his main cult site (6). Sacrifices were also made to him elsewhere (7). A nin-dingir dMes-lam- ta-é is mentioned (8), and date-formulae record the installation of a nin-dingir d Lugal-gi r-ra (f). In later ages sacrifices were . made to them (10), they were believed to cure fevers (A1), were invoked in incantations (12), and were regarded as apotropaic figures whose images of clay were buried to right and left of the door (18), or drawn on the walls (i4), as protection against demons. Moreover, they were assigned an important part in the New Year festival in the temple (l) AO. 6459, Obv. 26, Rev. 17; Falkenstein, Topographie von Uruk I, S. 19.

Douglas Van Buren of Anu and Antum at Uriik, for they, together with another door-keeper, Papsukkal, were sent to " take the hands of Anu " and lead him from the main court to his throne in his cella (4), and then, the rites accomplished, they conducted him back again (2). L ú - 1 à 1 , also referred to as G a 1 - 1 à 1 (3) or L u g a 1 - e d i n n a (4), and Latarak were identified in one text as Sin and Nergal (5). The literal meaning of the name Latarak (god-man-honey) suggests that the " tamarisk figures of... which carry honey and butter, on their sides write ' Wealth... ' " may have been intended to represent this pair of twins, the more so because the text continues " clay figures of Latarak, covered with green paste, bury in the corners of the back court. Clay figures of Latarak, covered with black paste, bury in the corners of the front court " (6). It is evident that the instruc- tions do not refer to two figures of Latarak both buried at the same spot, but in each case to one figure of Latarak and a second identi- cal figure of his twin Lú-làl. They were invoked in incantations (7), and " that nought evil might approach I set Latarak and Latarak in the gate " (8). Most of such information as we have about the Guardians of the Gate in the earlier epochs is derived from the account in the Epic of Adapa of the two gods Dumu zi and Gizzida who stood on watch at the entrance to Anu's palace in the heavens (9). When Adapa sought to enter the two guardians questioned him closely, but were finally satisfied with his answers and admitted him. Dumuzi-abzu, the later Tajnmuz, who according to the List of Gods was one of the six sons of Ea (10), was an ancient agrarian divinity, (4) AO. 6459, Obv. 27-9, Rev. 6-7.

Gizzida in his later aspect as Ningizzida, patron god of Gudea, was also a god of fertility and the blessings derived from moisture (4). The talîmê were, for the most part, rather indefinite and abstract figures. Gilgameš and Enkidu were certainly renowned characters in legend and possibly in history, if the accounts of Gilgameš as king of Uruk are founded on fact. They, however, were famous for their heroic exploits, but not, in earlier ages, as door-keepers. Dumuzi and Ningizzida, on the contrary, rose from the status of vague figures to become strongly individualized personalities. According to the Epic of Adapa they must be classed in the category of ' dying gods ' whose death and subsequent resurrection symbolized the decay • of vegetation and its return to life with the coming of Spring. They were divinities to whom sacrifice and worship were offered in their own sanctuaries or before their shrines in the temples of other deities. Hymns were chanted in their honour, and their powers and renown increased in proportion to the diffusion of their cults. The talîmê Kettu and Méšáru, , personifications of righteousness and justice (2), were also known as dNig-zi-da or dNig-gi-na and dNíg-si-sá (4), and are expressly stated in the Lists of Gods to have been the sons and squires of Šamaš (8). Even as late as the time of Nabûapalidinna the stone tablet which he deposited in the foundations of the temple of Šamaš at Sippar shows the two godlings leaning forward from the temple roof to pull taut the ropes which secured the sun-disk on the altar ; the accompanying inscription explains: " Between (the eyes of) the god Šahan are placed the ( 1 ) Van Buren, The God Ningizzida: Iraq I (1934), pp. 60-89; Jean, En marge du " Pantheon D e or um " ; No. 4 Ningiszida : AnOr 12 (1935), pp. 96-7.

In later ages sacrifices were offered to them (*). The chief cult site of Mêsâru was in the city of Hararati (3), and to the bít ilki-ti-tim money collected as tribute from the district Raljubu had to be paid (4). They were invoked in hymns (5), and in incantations (6). The reference to kakkab ilKittu u tlMéšárti in an astrological text proves that they were finally tianslated to the stars (7). Girru and Nus ku were reckoned as talîmê and must therefore originally have been door-keepers Nevertheless, they were fire-gods, and in later times the symbol of the god Gibil (Girru) seems to have been a torch (8), while a lamp became that of Nusku (9). They were appealed to for aid as " sons of Anu " (i0), and as fire-gods they were invoked in incantations to protect from magic practices and to burn up sorcerers and witches (4i). But their milder aspect was not forgotten, and it was as porter stationed at one of the door-ways of Anu's temple at Uruk that Nusku played a prominent part in the rites of the New Year festival (l2).

But they were not associated with the humble and pacific task of door-keepers, and in the Akkadian period were never pictured in that capacity. It was not until Neo-Sumerian and later ages that they were depicted in clay reliefs and engraved on cylinder seals on guard at the entrance to a temple or merely holding a gate-post. By that time, however, their fame as valiant heroes facilitated their transformation in popular belief into powerful protectors against all the forces of evil. Thus their duty was not to admit visitors into the presence of the higher divinity, but they were stationed at the entrance to protect the building from evil spirits and other foes who sought to gain access. Sometimes Gilgameš stands on one side, Enkidu on the other; more often one of them is represented, or the figure of Gilgameš or that of Enkidu is duplicated. During the first millennium the figure of Enkidu is rarely seen, although Gilgameš, in somewhat modified aspect, occasionally appears, almost always as an apotropaic figure rather than as a Guardian of the Gate. Presumably each pair of divine twins was characterized in some way so that they could be recognized at a glance ; but our knowledge is too limited to enable us to distinguish those subtle differentiations. It is at least certain that the aspect of the guardians who attended Enki was quite different from that of those who ministered to Šamaš. Starting from that definite point it may be possible to push our researches a little further. In the course of centuries religious beliefs became more sophisticated, and in conformity with more advanced modes of thought the talîmê were represented in a less naïve fashion. Their pictorial image seems to have been fixed in the Akkadian period, an epoch of wonderful artistic development and creative ex- periments in both form and content. The talîmê seem to be represented for the first time on a cylinder seal found at Kish (*) (Fig. 1). It may belong to the Early 21-2, 25; BIN II, 34 : 6 ; O.

Douglas Van Buren Dynastie III period rather to thé Akkadian era, and shows two identical, apparently nude men standing one on each side of the single panel of a closed door which they touch or hold with both hands. Behind them a gazelle rears upright with averted head. The meaning of the scene depicted is obscure, and, if it was really the talîmê who were pictured, there is nothing to indicate which pair of twins was portrayed. In Akkadian glyptic art the god Enki is frequently shown seated and holding a vase from which flow streams of water; sometimes the vase is not rendered, and the streams seem to pour forth from the god's body. He is attended by two officials, each holding one of the door-posts. They are pictured as mature bearded men with thick hair waved over their heads and long enough to be turned up and fastened at the back. Their only raiment consists of a girdle wound three times round the waist and tied at one side with short hanging ends spread out on one hip. Their attitude is always absolutely antithetical ; sometimes they kneel upon one knee, at other times they stand erect. A very unusual seal found at Tell Asmar pictures streams spurting from the person of the seated god, on either side of whom kneels a nude guardian with triple girdle who, however, does not hold a gate-post, but with both hands grasps a vase from which a stream of water gushes forth to form an arch over his head and then to fall to the ground behind him (A) (Fig. 2). In the more usual presentations of the subject the two guardians hold the door-posts and look towards Enki to await his commands, especially when they are represented alone with him (*) (Figs. 3, 8). If other figures are introduced into the scene the guardians turn back their heads to enquire why the newcomers desire to enter (8) (Fig. 4). Sometimes the guardians follow with their eyes the applicants whom they have allowed to pass (4) (Fig. 5) ; or, their duty done, they (A) IM., As. 32. 1276. (2) Legrain, PBS XIV, p. 189, pl.

A small group of seals represent the god Enki in his watery shrine, the gate-posts of which are held by the two guardians. In one case a worshipper appeals to the guardians (*), but more often the minister of Enki, the bifrons Usmu, seeks admission for himself (8), or for the divine or mortal worship- pers he wishes to introduce into Enki's presence (4) (Fig. 7). One guardian alone, kneeling on one knee, is depicted on two seals, the second example being the finest of the whole series (5) (Fig. 8). The rules applying to the representations of the Guardians of the Gate of Enki seem to be violated by variations from the normal engraved on one seal (6). The god Enki, identifiable by the jet of water issuing from the (invisible) vase he holds in one hand, sits in his shrine and raises one hand to greet three divinities who stand looking towards him. They all wear horned caps and long skirls with vertical pleats. The one farthest to left stands with clasped hands; so does the second from whose shoulders flames or rays rise. The third, nearest to the shrine, seems to stretch out both arms to grasp the door-post. But this divinity does not resemble the nude guardians of Enki, but is clothed and crowned, and is the type of guardian always associated with Šamaš. Thus it seems likely that he was not really a servitor of the seated deity in front of him,, but was intended to identify the god with rays who stood behind him and whose attendant he was. As stated above, the more frequent and perhaps earlier type of Enki's guardians portrayed them with hair waved and turned up at the back, and with a beard trimmed more or less to a points There is, however, another type which approximates to the figure frequently seen in the art of the period Early Dynastic III and usually described as Gilgameš or, more cautiously, as the ' Wild Man* (A) Weber, Altor.

Like the guardians of Enki his raiment consists only of a girdle wound thrice round his waist and tied over one hip. His hair, often in wild disarray, is parted in the middle and sticks out in three curls on each side of his head ; his fan-shaped beard is in separate locks, each one ending in a knoblike curl. The twin guardians of this wilder version stand (') (Fig. 6), or kneel (*). One guardian only, standing (3), or kneeling on one knee (4) (Fig. 8), is occasionally represented. This resemblance to the hero of an earlier age at once raises the difficult problem of the identification of this particular pair of twins. Earlier writers usually describe them as Gilgameš whose figure was duplicated for purposes of symmetry. In archaic Sumerian art, however, although the figures in a scene were usually arranged to make a balanced group, they were very rarely duplicated merely to obtain a symmetrical effect. Still less so in the Akkadian period when the prime object of the artist was to illustrate an event which was supposed to have happened. Akkadian art was fundamentally realistic ; if two figures were depicted, then two distinct individuals were intended. Sometimes only one of a pair was pictured because, from the very nature of their functions, these beings were thought of as inseparable, always working in unison, and consequently the unpictured brother would automatically be supplied by the imagination ■of the beholder. It is true that the so-called Gilgameš of the Early Dynastic III period was occasionally shown grasping the two door-posts between which he stands (5). But in such cases he is alone and not one of a pair, his attitude apparently being intended to imply that he (i) Ward, SC., fig. 284; BM. 89771, King, Hist, of Babylon, pl.

When enumerated among the talîmê Gilgameš was paired with Enkidu. Yet Enkidu is certainly not depicted as one of the Guard- ians of the Gate of Enki, neither is there any evidence that Gil- gameš ministered to the God of the Watery Deep in that capacity. Certain texts, however, state that Ea was a son of Anu, at the doors of whose palace Dumuzi and Gizzida stood on watch. Heidenreich was the first to suggest that Dumuzi, the later Tammuz, was the personage portrayed by the 'Nude Hero* of the earlier age (4). It was he and his faithful companion Gizzida who were believed to have acted as guardians at the entrance to Anu's palace, and then, transferred to the service of Anu's son Enki, were shown in the Akkadian period guarding the portals of that deity. In the absence of definite proof it might be suggested that the iconographical history of Dumuzi and Gizzida was as follows: They were very ancient fertility divinities whose anthropomorphic images were conceived in the simplest possible form as men or nude heroes. But in the Early Dynastic III period the ' Nude Hero' par excellence was the one who has been identified as Gilgameš. Therefore the images of the divine twins were gradually assimilated to that of the so-called Gilgameš, an assimilation facilitated by the fact that he also was numbered among the divine twins. Their hair and beard resembled his, they wore his triple girdle which has been explained by L. Curtius as a fertility symbol of running water (f). This more animated conception of their aspect gradually predominated over or absorbed the quieter presentation, so that eventually in succeeding ages it alone prevailed. Two guardians of a different type are represented on a seal found at Ishschali (3) (Fig. 9) On their heads are flat caps encircled by a single pair of horns, and they wear long skirts with vertical folds. They stand holding the posts, one on the right, the other on the left of a door-way. As the two halves of this door do not (4) Heiden reich, Beiträge zur Geschichte der vorderas.

A tree grows in the space between the backs of the guardians, as is very frequently the case in scenes portraying guardians of this type who were associ- ated with Šamaš (4) (Figs. 10-12). Although minor details in their dress and appearance might vary, the main characteristic of this pair of twins was that they were clothed. They were almost invariably bearded. Their hair might be turned up and fastened at the back with one or more bands (2); it might be combed straight down (3) (Figs. 11-13); or it might hang down between their shoulder-blades and end in a spiral curl (4) (Figs. 14, 18). A few examples show them wearing a pointed cap with several pairs of horns (5) (Figs. 17, 18), instead of the usual flat cap with a single pair of horns. There are several unusual details in a scene where one twin only is seen (*) (Fig. 12); he wears a curious horned cap and his skirt is fringed along the lateral and bottom hems, a peculiarity observable, however, on two other seals (7) (Fig. 13). A rope serves to pull the door open or to fasten it. (l) Basmadschi, Landschaftliche Elemente in der mesop.

The talîmê throw open the double leaves of the door, and there is almost always a tree in the back- ground. Sometimes one or both leaves of the door are rendered, but only one guardian is visible (4) (Figs. 10-14). A curious seal from Susa shows the doors thrown wide by one guardian to reveal Šamaš who does not rise above mountains, but between two recumbent man-headed bulls on whose heads he rests his hands (*). In the complete scene, however, both guardians are present; very rarely they look towards the rising god, but almost always turn their heads back as if to call the attention of beholders to the apotheosis being revealed (8) (Figs. 15-16). The rising god and the two guardians are essential elements in the scene, although other figures are occasionally introduced. Another god comes to salute Šamaš (4), or to introduce a worshipper (5) (Figs. 14, 18). A few examples show a man appealing timidly to one of the guardians (6) (Figs. 13, 17), or bringing a kid as an offering (7) (Figs. 15, 16). (£) Speiser, Tepe Gawra I, pl.

Douglas Van Buren A variation from the usual scheme can be seen on a seal stated to be in the Metropolitan Museum (4). The tiny figure of a god standing above (presumably in) a boat appears behind the two guardians who open the doors but look back towards him. It is perhaps temerarious to offer an interpretation of the scene without an examination of the seal or a good photograph to correct the sketch which possibly misrepresented details. It is tempting, however, to think that it may illustrate two episodes in the myth; the distant Sun-god traversing by night the heavenly ocean and eagerly awaited by the guardians who watch for him while he is still far off, as indicated by his reduced size; then, the voyage accomplished, his manifestation at dawn rising above the mountains. Among the seals representing Šamaš rising above the mountains a very few form a class apart because they are all well-worked and include a remarkable detail. The best and most complete pictures the god, facing to left, poised on ruggedly rocky mountains (f). Rays burst from his shoulders and even from his skirt, and he holds aloft his toothed sword. The doors are opened by two guardians whose long hair hangs down between their shoulder-blades ; they have flat caps encircled by a single pair of horns, and rather short skirts with vertical folds. The one on the left looks backwards to see if there are other worshippers besides the man carrying a kid, whose visit the guardian on the right announces to Šamaš. What is unusual in this scene is that the doors are a precise illustration of the doors made by Gudea for the temple Eninnu at Lagaš. 44 The doors of cedar-wood installed in the gateway,... the pivots were like a lion... placed above the doors he caused a young lion and a young panther to dwell " (3). Here the lions stand on top of the wings of the door with their tails hanging down inside; they face outwards and roar defiance at any unwarranted approach. Although the lower part of the seal is damaged the lions on which the doors pivotted can still be seen (Fig. 16). They also face outwards, and their long tails ending in a tuft stick up parallel with the inner edge of the wings of the door. In other examples of the class only the lions above the door are visible (4) (Fig. 1 7). The last example of the class (i) Ward, SC., fig. 245. (2) Delaporte, CCO., A. 139, pl. 71, fig. 7.

The doors are guarded only by the lions above them ; on the left two men, possibly the guardians, lead away a bird-man whom they have made pri- soner (4). Other scenes picturing the Guardians of the Gate with Šamaš are rare. In one the two guardians open the wings of the door to reveal Šamaš, with rays and toothed sword, seated facing to right upon a backless stool (*). Another shows Šamaš, again with rays and toothed sword, seated facing to left. The doors of his temple are opened by a guardian who looks back towards a divinity leading a man whom he has introduced into the presence of the god (3). The door is reduced to a post held by a guardian in a similar scene where, however, the seated divinity is not distinguished by either rays or toothed sword. To him a long-haired goddess presents a man followed by a youth carrying a goat (4). The seal, de Clercq No. 143, has already been mentioned. Šamaš seeks audience with Enki seated in his watery shrine. The divinity between them is of the type of the guardians of Šamaš, but it is hard to determine whether he touches the shrine or holds an independent gate-post to imply that the Sun-god quits his own temple to visit his divine colleague (5). This obscure composition has some affinity with the fine seal found at Ur which represents Enki in his shrine of rippling water, the door-post of which is held by a nude kneeling guardian (•) (Fig. 8). Beyond the shrine a god, presumably Marduk, with rays and armed with a mace, sets one foot on a zikkurrat. Behind him Šamaš, with rays and' toothed sword, mounts upwards, not over mountains, but with one foot on the shoulder of a kneeling godling, the other on the back of a roaring lion. The lion is thus placed below the left wing of the door, so that it is possible that the two small figures, godling and lion, typified the anthropomorphic and the theriomorphic images of the Guardians of the Gate.

Douglas Van Buren There may be some uncertainty as to the identification of the two guardians of Enki's door, but there can be no doubt that the divine twins who attend Šamaš are Kettu and Mēšāru. As personi- fications of moral qualities they were always decorously clothed, and as offspring of one of the greater gods they were entitled to wear the horned cap in token of divinity. It is, perhaps, surprising that these embodiments of righteousness and justice are not present in scenes which might be thought to depict Šamaš as the divine judge delivering his verdict (4). An obscure subject, represented only on Akkadian cylinder seals, is that of the ť Winged Gate'. The main elements of the composition are a bull who lies or, less frequently, stands in the foreground facing towards a seated divinity who is apparently feminine. Usually she holds the bull by one horn or by means of a rope attached to the beast. Above or behind the bull's back rises what seems to be a closed door, from either side of which near the top a wing projects. Many explanations of this subject have been proposed (2), but to most of them some objection might be raised. Dr. Legrain considers that the scene depicted the ' gate of night ' shutting in the Moon-god in his aspect as ' the young Bull of Heaven ' The female figure is the daughter or priestess of the Moon-god, and the attendant helps to keep the bull within the enclosure until the gate is opened at evening (3). Professor Henri Frankfort thinks the subject illustrated the myth of Ištar and the Bull of Heaven. Having promised Anu that the beast should not be allowed to reach the ' Place of Surjrise ' the goddess sits close to the gate through which the rays of the rising sun infiltrate in the shape of wings, and controls the bull by means of a halter. She and the attendant often hold the ends of the ropes which were fastened to the gate to keep it closed (4). Nevertheless, they hold them so slackly that the bull could at any moment burst the barrier, whereas he seems perfectly peaceful. All that can be said is that this enigmatic subject has certain elements which link it to the more easily interpreted one of Šamaš rising above (4) Delaporte, CCO., A. 147, pl. 72, fig. 2; Ward, SC., figs. 272, 274-5, 279-82.

Thus, here also, they were presumably talîmê who might be thought to perform their office in the service of the goddess. The Guardians of the Gate were not always present (*). Sometimes one only, kneeling or standing, is represented (8) (Fig. 19), in which case the goddess often holds the loose end of the second rope (4). When both guard- ians kneel and hold the ropes on each side of the door the seated goddess is omitted (5) (Fig. 20). Guardians and bull are suppressed on one seal, but the ropes are held by a figure seated on each side of the door; these figures, from their dress and head-gear, are evidently divinities (6), and this duplication seems to prove that it was not Ištar who was portrayed, but an ancillary goddess, perhaps, as Dr. Legrain believes, a daughter or daughters of Sin. One specimen is peculiar because it is the door which has disappeared, although the door-keeper, standing on the right, holds what must be a vestige of rope and not a spray of foliage (7). A seal from Susa has the unusual variant that a divinity seems to stand in front of the bull (8). The whole composition is altered (l) Ward, SC., fig. 246; Samml. Hahn Nr. 80, Weber, Altor .

Douglas Van Buren on two seals, for instead of the usual attendants two nude figures leap through the air away from the 'Winged Gate', one to right, the other to left ; below the one on the right and behind the bull, stands a fully clothed figure who, perhaps, represents the door-keeper (*). The theme of the ' Winged Gate ' is secondary on another seal, for it is reduced to the gate behind the recumbent bull, and is placed behind the main subject in which the god Enki sits with his back turned to the gate and holds the flowing vase while he receives a worshipper who carries a goat and is introduced by a goddess (2). The guardians usually wear a long robe and the head-gear of a divinity (Fig. 19). Occasionally when one of them kneels on one knee beside the doòr his raiment appears to consist solely of a girdle (Fig. 20). But the kneeling figure clad in a skirt of VA. 555 (8) suggests that the door-keepers were always supposed to be clothed, although the difficulty of drawing such a complicated attitude might cause the engraver to omit completely any vesture or to render the garment by a few simple lines which were soon obliterated. Evidently these figures belonged to the class of Guardians of the Gate and divine twins, but without more complete understanding of the subject depicted any identification of them must necessarily be theoretical. It is not even certain if they were in the service of the goddess, for she participates in their task and they pay less attention to her than to the door upon which their whole interest is concentrated, although their actions beside it might be susceptible of more than one explanation. The door is always closed and they do not attempt to pull it open. On the other hand, the safest way to keep a door securely shut would be to tie the ropes taut on each side. Ropes held as slackly as here pictured would be no barrier against violence from the bull in front or from somebody on the further side of the door who wished to enter. The attitude of the guardians, and of the goddess if she also holds one of the ropes, seems to be one of patient waiting for a later moment of action. The composition previously discussed revealed Šamaš rising (4) Ward, Cat . Morgan Coll., pl. XIII, No. 84; Contenau, RA XXVIII (1931), p. 43, fig. X. (2) Carnegie, Cat. Southesk Coll. II, pl.

Perhaps the contrasting myth was« here illustrated, and the moment awaited was that of sunset when the door was thrown open before the Moon-god Nannar in the guise of a bull. If that were true the door-keepers would have been, officials of Sin, and not of the goddess. Nevertheless, without more definite proof of their identity any attempt to name them must remain speculative. There is great divergence of opinion concerning the ambiguous- being, the upper part of whose body is anthropomorphic in form,, but below the waist becomes a sinuous serpent (*). He is described as the Snake-god, and generally identified as Šahan (Šerah) the Snake-god who, according to the great List of Gods, belonged to the family of Enlil (8), and whose cult centre was at Dêr. It is^ believed that the name Šahan signified ' fire and that Šerah meant ť grain', 'vegetation' (4). It has also been thought that the symbol of a rod ending in a triangular butt and tipped with a big star, often placed close to the Snake-god on cylinder seals representing him, was the ideogram for MUŠ, an alternative name for that divinity (5). Nevertheless, that symbol appears in scenes featuring other gods, above all Šamaš (6). Consequently, another school of thought holds that the star on a rod was a pictographic rendering of a group of signs which cannot be read otherwise than as the name of the Sun-god (7).

The hybrid being pictured -on Akkadian seals was, apparently, entirely beneficent; he received his worshippers kindly and seems to have been associated with fertility. Not only do some of the small number of scenes in which he figures represent him with a spray of verdure in one hand (*) (Fig. 24), or with a tree or plant near him (3) (Fig. 25-6), but numerous works of art representing snakes or a snake-god were found at Tell Asmar in the temple of the Fertility-god Abu (4). An altar from which flames rise is usually placed before the Snake- god in seals of this class (5) (Fig. 26). This has been taken to indicate -the association with fire. If that surmise is well founded it would imply that the characteristics of fire and fertility are not as incom- patible as might be supposed. Usually the Snake-god is placed opposite a seated divinity, and the altar stands between them (6) (Figs. 21-3). Occasionally he alone receives his worshippers (7) {Figs. 25-6, 28). Still more rarely a detail of great interest is added, namely, one or both wings of a double door (8) (Fig. 27), thus indicating that the god is supposed to be within his temple.

The guardian of the Snake-god's temple differs in aspect from those of the Sun-god, for his thick hair is uncovered, and he wears a long, plain robe fringed round the bottom. There is no evidence to prove which pair of divine twins were in the service of the Snake-god. His apparent association with fire suggests that they might be Girru and Nusku who were themselves fire- gods. Never- theless, as no authentic image of these two gods has come down to us it is impossible to be sure if in appearance they resembled the Guardian of the Gate of the Snake-god portrayed on the Ak- kadian seal. The talîmê are known by name, and in later ages certain details about their characteristics and cults can be gathered, but in earlier times their personalities are, in some cases, very indistinct. A little light may be thrown upon the subject by combining what information can be derived from the Epics and from religious and other texts with the pictorial representations, even if the latter are provisionally limited to those of the Akkadian period. It becomes clear that the talîmê were attached to a few of the great gods only, although they could apparently be transferred from the service of one deity to that of another. For instance, Dumuzi and Gizzida were originally Guardians of the Gate of Anu, but later became officials of Enki, just as works of art of the time of the Dynasties of Isin and Larsa show Gilgameš and Enkidu in attendance upon Ištar. One fact, however, emerges from the mist, namely, the close connection between almost all the divine twins and the god Anu. Lugalgirra and Mešlamtaea were acclaimed as " first-born of Anu", and to them were assigned important duties in the great yearly ceremonies in the temple of Anu and Antum at Uruk. Dumuzi and Gizzida were "Guardians of the Gate of Anu's palace" in the heavens. They were afterwards transferred to the service of Enki, reputed to be a son of Anu. Girru and Nusku were invoked as "sons of Anu", and at one of the doors of Anu's temple at Uruk Nusku, presumably accompanied by Girru, was stationed as porter, in which capacity he officiated in the rites of the New Year festival. Just at the period when there was a great religious movement to (*) Bibl. Nat. No. 78.</page><page sequence="21">332 E. Douglas Van Buren establish the position of Ištar as the beloved daughter of Anu and heiress of all his rights, Gilgameš and Enkidu were represented on guard at the entrance to her temple, thus suggesting that their services were part of the inheritance taken over by the goddess. These items of information, taken as a whole, lead to the con- clusion that originally all the talîmê were related to Anu by ties of blood or of hereditary service ; they were, in fact, components of the 'family' of Anu. When the prominence of Anu's position in the pantheon decreased this connection lapsed into abeyance. Nevertheless, it was never totally forgotten, and at a later period when Anu's cult was revitalized the talîmê were recalled to his service, and resumed their office in his temple as Guardians of the Gate.</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 1 : Ashmolean Mus.
