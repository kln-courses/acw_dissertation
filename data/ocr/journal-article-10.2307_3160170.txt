<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA CHARLES ARTHUR HAWLEY Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Omaha, Nebr. Gerald Massey, once hailed by Landor as comparable to Keats, to "a chastened Hafiz," to Shakespeare when at his best in his sonnets, has earned the reward of forgotten prophets. This poet, who espoused the cause of chartism in the England of his day, who worked for the common people, who helped shape democracy, was eclipsed by Tennyson, his contemporary and rival. Massey, who came to the defence of F. D. Maurice with these lines: God bless you, Brave One, in our dearth, Your life shall leave a trailing glory; And round the poor man's homely hearth We proudly tell your suffering's story, brought to America the seed of the social gospel. It was this same Massey whom George Eliot met and admired in London and later portrayed in Felix Holt, the Radical. Perhaps this last word, radical, gives the key to Massey's undeserved oblivion. His radicalism kept him from being ap- pointed poet laureate, a distinction which many of his contem- poraries believed he should have had. And yet his radicalism was of the mildest sort. It came from his own bitter experi- ence. The son of a desperately poor canal driver, Massey was born in 1828, in Hertfordshire; in his later years he de- clared that he "had no childhood." Growing up in a hovel, with illiterate parents, yet through his mother he learned to love the Bible, to value honesty, virtue, and self denial. In later years Massey used to tell of the struggle of his mother, during a whole winter when his father had no work, to keep the family of six on the pittance which the children earned in a nearby factory. At the age of eight, Gerald was put to work in a silk mill from five o'clock in the morning till half past six in the evening. For a week's work he received one shilling. Such conditions have been preserved in Dickens's novels and in Mrs. Browning's "The Cry of the Children." A brief respite came 356</page><page sequence="2">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA when one day the mill burned. Massey in his old age used to tell of the glee with which the children stood for hours in the stormy weather rejoicing at the fire. But worse slavery was to befall him. Soon after the mill burned he was sent to the marsh district where he contracted fever and for months lay burning with the dread disease, thinking continually of the story of Lazarus in Abraham's bosom. With the Bible and Pilgrim's Progress as primers, he learned to read. One day a Methodist worker left some tracts which the boy hungrily devoured. Then he secured a copy of Robinson Crusoe. With this background, at the age of fifteen he found his way to London, where in squalor and poverty he wrote poetry. But in London he found books and, standing long hours in second-hand book stores, he nournished his soul on Greek and Roman history, and on the poets and philosophers. Then came the French Revolution of 1848, and to the cause of freedom Massey dedicated his life. He now began to collect his poems, which he had constantly been writing since his com- ing to London. The next year he edited for the working class an inexpensive paper, The Spirit of Freedom. Massey now associated himself with Thomas Cooper who, influenced by the Old Testament prophets, later became a licensed Methodist preacher and publisher of Cooper's Journal. To this paper Massey contributed political and social verse. When the journal failed, Charles Kingsley turned Cooper to the lecture platform. In this manner Massey, too, came to the attention of Frederic Denison Maurice, and the other leaders in the Christian Socialist Movement. Kingsley had just writ- ten Alton Locke and commanded considerable power. In commending Massey to Kingsley, Maurice wrote that the young poet-reformer was "not quite an Alton Locke but with some real stuff in him." With this new inspiration, Massey brought out his second volume of verse, Voices of Freedom and Lyrics of Love. The book was favorably received. The third volume, The Ballad of Babe Christabel and Other Poems, put Massey in the front ranks of the new poets. The working- man-poet had become a teacher to his class. Here the "cry of the unemployed" became vocal. England paused to listen; the book became at once a best seller. The first year saw five editions. Ruskin joined the ranks of the young poet's admirers, reserving his praise, however, for Massey's efforts on behalf 357</page><page sequence="3">CHURCH HISTORY of the working classes. Dickens asked him to contribute to a paper he was then editing. At the home of John Chapman he met George Eliot, who studied him for her Felix Holt. Then Tennyson joined the ranks of his well wishers. About this time when Massey turned to lecturing, his reputation reached America; and Ticknor and Fields, the well known publishing house in Boston, brought out in 1857 an American edition of his Complete Poetical Works. James Fields, while on one of his many trips to England, sought out Massey and discussed with him the possibility of an American lecture tour. Dickens had become an intimate friend of James and Annie Fields. Massey's interests were similar to those of Dickens, and the latter's Boston admirers believed Massey should receive the same consideration in America as had Dickens. After 1860, Massey, however, turned his thoughts more and more to religion. In religion he saw poetry, the cry for justice, and the hope of realization for man's ardent desires. In 1869 he published his Tale of Eternity, which marked his conversion to Spiritualism, at that time a popular religion. At once he became the Sir Oliver Lodge of his time. It is likely also that Massey was, during this period of transition, influ- enced by the writings of Swedenborg, which had caught the imagination of William Blake, Coleridge, the elder Henry James, the Brownings, and had sent Emerson to England with his well known essay on the great mystic. Massey's interest in social reform was furthered also by the teaching of Sweden- borg, who had put forth very definite social and economic ideas which were at the basis of many groups in the nineteenth century which proposed to alter the prevailing social evils. By 1863, Massey had come to be recognized as a man of letters with a wholesome attitude toward both capital and labor. Christian Socialism had, at the time of Massey's recognition, become respectable in England, and Lord Palmerston put Massey's name on the civil list for a pension to the amount of seventy pounds. Massey now began seriously to prepare lectures for an American tour. He accepted Fields' invitation and arrived in America in September, 1873. II Massey made his first appearance in America as a lecturer, in October, 1873, a few months after John Tyndall had toured 358</page><page sequence="4">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to Maryland lecturing on the new science. Tyndall had received an invitation to the "West" and was disappointed not to have been able to accept. He returned to England leaving questioning audiences behind him. The stage seemed set, therefore, for Massey when he came in the following autumn. Massey's lectures went directly to the heart of the conflict of religion with science. The subject was by this time no longer a burning issue in England, for the influence of Darwin's Origin of Species had now permeated the English mind. American thought, however, lagged far behind. In 1850 Tennyson had published In Memoriam in which he grappled with the new theory and Browning had also given serious thought to the problem. In 1871, two years before Massey's arrival in America, Darwin had further elaborated his hypothesis in his Descent of Man. Thus in America Massey found an eager, expectant audience. Massey's first lecture in New York received much atten- tion. The New York Tribune on Monday, October 27, wrote a long article saying in part: "Gerald Massey, the English poet, delivered his first lecture in this country at Unity Chapel ... it was a history of the orthodox devil in different ages and with different races. Having proved the devil to be a myth, he proceeded to show that the only evil spirit now is one created by men themselves, and that Spiritualism throws the most light upon that subject. Mr. Massey is a clear, rapid speaker, with a good command of language and flow of thoughts." Then follows a long summary of the lecture, the main theme of which was an attempt to explain the anthropomorphism of the Old Testament, its "myths" and their relation to the thought of other ancient peoples. "Out of all this came the idea of the Devil which has plagued the human race for ages. In modern times Luther, Calvin and Milton resuscitated the Devil, but he really does not exist." In conclusion, Massey made an appeal to his audience to know Christ: "Surely, no human be- ing has been so much misinterpreted as the man Christ Jesus. He came not to preach a sermon, not to write a novel, but to live a life, a life that is an example to us. It was a full-length, straightforward laying down his life for others." But what have men done? Have they followed His example? "Instead of following that example they have actually rested all their hopes of salvation on that death. They have erected churches, 359</page><page sequence="5">CHURCH HISTORY splendid tombs in which they have buried Him. It is so much easier to set up a God for worship at a far-o-ff distance .... The reason then why God does not kill the Devil is because man has unconsciously created all that is the Devil, which here and hereafter is constantly destroying his own work." This lecture seems to have been Massey's favorite. He delivered it from New York to California and always to eager audiences. Massey's second lecture in New York as reported by the papers was entitled "Concerning a Spirit World Revealed to the Natural World" and was reported by the New York Times at length. Without any preliminary words, Massey went to the "two theories of man's origin-one which held that he had been struck out perfect from the hands of the Creator, and the other that he has been evolved from the animal kingdom, of which he is the crowning work." Then he elaborated his own theory. Massey had no fear of the theory of Darwin, "and he believed that the spiritual nature of man was graduated in the same way, growing out of small perceptions into force and maturity, and assuming its way from that which was merely objective to the subtler and more subjective forms of spiritual life." And then Massey turned to his religious experience, his conversion to spiritualism. "Darwinism could only be com- pleted and clinched by Spiritualism." But how does the in- visible "first make itself known to the human mind?" He then went on to speak of the resurrection of Jesus, who "took the material and objective form under which they had known Him in life." Before Jesus, Socrates had been "the greatest medium of the immaterial and invisible world." Massey proved to be at home in Greek thought, culling from Hesiod to Plato, as well as from contemporary thought. He referred to the state- ment, then common, that Dickens had said that "every word spoken by his characters was distinctly heard or overheard by him." Since 1848 Spiritualism had been thriving in the United States. Abetted by the "mysticism" of Swedenborg, pop- ularized by Emerson, a great curiosity had swept the country as to its meaning and purport. Massey with his synthesis of science, Spiritualism, and the social application of the Bible, attracted many curious as well as deeply serious inquirers. His first attempt as a lecturer in America seemed success- ful, although he was disappointed in a lecture bureau which 360</page><page sequence="6">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA failed to arrange an acceptable itinerary for him. He com- plained of this to Fields, for he seems to have desired to lecture through the West during the fall months, coming to Boston in the winter. Since the visit of Mr. and Mrs. Fields to England in 1859, Massey had been in correspondence with Fields and had looked forward to his American visit. Dickens had told Massey about his trip in 1842, when he went as far west as St. Louis, and got stuck in the mud at Cairo. Massey wanted to plan better. In December, Massey appeared in St. Louis under the auspices of the "Star Lecture Course." According to the St. Louis Globe, he lectured at the Mercantile Literary Hall on December 11. He was heralded as "a popular lecturer, poet and literator." But St. Louis in 1873 was conservative in its re- ligious thinking, and when Massey announced his favorite title, "Why Does Not God Kill the Devil?" the lecture was "not so well attended as many others of the course . . . in as much as the very title carried with it the idea of something bordering on infidelity. . . . The lecturer entered at length upon com- parisons between Old Testament narratives and the mythological narratives of the Persians and other Eastern nations, from which he deduced an argument that the Old Testament is nothing less than a compilation of mythological accounts which the Jews derived from more ancient nations differing from them only in matters of chronology . . . The devil of theology was the offspring of theology, and not the result of any spiritual revelation . . . The question 'why does not God kill the devil,' was not answered by the lecturer. Judging from the line of his argument, there is no devil to kill." Thus ended the lecture career of Massey in St. Louis. The city was not ready for comparative religion, nor was it ready to examine its theological presuppositions. After the lecture at the Mercantile Literary Hall, Massey left at once for Chicago, where better things awaited him. III In Chicago the way had been prepared for Massey through the work of Emerson and other far seeing leaders. Since 1853, Emerson had paid periodic visits to Chicago, and there had grown up about him a group definitely committed to new ideas. One result of this spirit of liberalism was the founding of the 361</page><page sequence="7">CHURCH HISTORY Chicago Philosophical Society in September preceding Massey's arrival. The officers of the club included those who had been most active in promoting Emerson's lectures. Massey lectured before the Free Religious Society on December 14, 1873, coming directly from St. Louis. Because of some delay the lecture advertised for the morning was de- livered in the evening. General I. N. Stiles, who introduced Massey, paid a glowing tribute to England's lecturers to Amer- ica, mentioning Thackeray, Dickens, Tyndall, and others. Turning to Massey he said: "One of the distinguished names I have mentioned is with us tonight. A determined enemy of opposition and wrong, and a life time friend of the weak and defenseless. Though an Englishman, he is more than an Englishman. Self-made, self-taught, and self reliant, he be- longs not to England alone, but to America, to the world...." Massey's first lecture in Chicago was entitled "Christ, A Medium." He struck out boldly into liberal theology, disclaim- ing belief in miracle. The sun did not stand still "in order that certain armies might polish off their enemies before dark." Again, as in his earlier lectures, he attacked the historicity of the Old Testament but spoke always with reverent praise for Jesus. Massey's position as to miracle was that of the deist, or perhaps that of Emerson. "Jesus Christ had no notion that a miracle was law-breaking . . . Christ recognized the fact that his miracles were not intended to break God's law . . . There were degrees of spiritual power then as now, and Jesus Christ was the greatest spiritualist that ever lived." Jesus came "to create a reign of the Holy Spirit." Massey then went on to announce his decided disbelief in the doctrine of the Trinity, tracing the idea back to Egypt. According to all reports, the house was full. Massey had won Chicago, the city of ideas. Massey next appeared before the Chicago Philosophical Society. The schedule of lecturers for the Society had already been made out, and Massey's lecture was an "extra lecture, admission free." The chairman of the committee on "moral philosophy," who arranged for Massey to lecture was the prom- inent Methodist minister, the Reverend Hiram Washington Thomas. Later, when Thomas was being tried for heresy, his ecclesiastical enemies taunted him with the charge that he 362</page><page sequence="8">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA had brought the liberal-minded Massey to Chicago. Dr. Thomas was also the leading spirit in the Philosophical Society as well as in the Chicago Round Table. This latter group was limited to the clergy of Chicago and was the first religious group in the Middle West where Jews and Christians met on an absolute basis of equality. From Chicago Massey went to Boston. He had spent two months studying the West and afterward expressed him- self as much more optimistic about the future of the West than of the East. In Boston Massey was met by his old literary friends, James and Annie Fields. Another admirer in Ames- bury, the Quaker poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, awaited him. Whittier kept Massey's Poems in his study, and the books, preserved to this day, show that they were much read. But Whittier had not been drawn to Massey merely through the latter's poetry; it was his humanitarianism, his reliance on the spirit rather than upon the written word alone, that attracted W?hittier. Massey delivered his first lecture in Boston at Music Hall, January 5, 1874. He was scheduled to give four lectures at the same place on four consecutive Sundays. The subject of his first lecture was "Why Am I a Spiritualist?" He believed New England to be intensely interested in Spiritualism, and apparently it was. He was greeted by "a full house." The Boston papers gave much space to his published works, praising him as a well known literary figure. He told his Boston audience frankly that he wanted to talk about himself first, since "it took him years to reach his conclusion." His theory caught the attention of the literary people, many of whom were dabbling in "spirits" at the time. "Man has united in himself," he told Boston, "the spiritual and natural, and the boundary line between them could not be drawn . . . A man's real, spiritual self is his will and his affections personified. I prefer to think of it thus, just as I prefer to think of God as father. to all chemical considerations of his nature or metaphysical mysteries of his attributes . . . Let men but truly realize that the better angel of themselves, when in the shape of a loving wife, or mother, or child gone before, can see them still; that they look at their sins and failings, their worldliness and greed with rebuking eyes, divinely grave, filled with their larger purer love, they would try not to do that which would make 363</page><page sequence="9">CHURCH HISTORY them veil their eyes with anguish." And Boston went home largely convinced. The following Sunday, Massey spoke on 'The Universal Church to an audience larger than a week ago." This was the lecture given in New York, but Boston was more enthusi- astic than New York had been. The third Sunday he lectured on "Jesus Christ, the Great Misapprehended Spiritualist." Again Boston applauded. The fourth lecture was his old favorite, "Why Does not God Kill the Devil?" Boston was interested, where St. Louis feared and stayed away. While in Boston, Massey was feted by the literati of the city. One of the most important dinners was given on Janu- ary 17 at Odd Fellows' Hall to observe the semi-centennial of the Franklin Typographical Society. Among the speakers were Governor Washburn, Edward Everett Hale, Judge Russell, and the guest of honor, the celebrated poet and theologian, Gerald Massey. Three hundred invited guests heard Edward Everett Hale give the invocation, but their attention was on Massey. The president of the society introduced Massey with a quota- tion from his Songs of Labor: Build up heroic lives and all Be like a sheathen sabre Ready to flash out at God's call, O chivalry of Labor. That night in Boston Massey proclaimed his social gospel. The reporter of the Boston Daily Advertiser, the paper made famous by Edward Everett Hale's father, wrote: "It appeared as though he (Massey) had come to America to discover him- self. It was like looking in a mirror, but the man he saw there was not himself. It was the boy rather of twenty-five years ago .... It was true that he was called a poet of the poor, but indeed he cared little for what was said of him as a poet." This was precisely the attitude taken by Whittier, who declared that his work as an abolitionist he counted above all his poetry. "He (Massey) referred to those 'dainty ladies, who looked as though they hacd just come through a shower of jewels' who congratulated him on his poem, 'Little Willie,' innocent of the fact that little Willie was his own brother's child who had died a cruel death in the workhouse and lay buried in its grave. Such facts from the life of the poor could never be forgotten. But now he declared he wanted action, to do 364</page><page sequence="10">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA things rather than set words to music." That January night Boston heard as never before the social gospel. Massey con- tinued, "Poor Hood sang his 'Song of the Shirt' some thirty years ago, and the world wept and dried its eyes. Something, doubtless, was done. But whereas the shirt maker then made shirts for five cents a day, I saw a case later in London in which a poor woman was making shirts for three cents a day! Mere sentimentality and charity do not touch bottom and never will! . .And if you ask how, I answer that the first practical attempt at practical Christianity is the cooperation of capital and labor and the unification of these interests in one. No rise in the rate of wages will ever solve the problem." After Massey's address, the toastmaster read a letter from Whittier, who wrote that illness kept him from the dinner. "As I cannot be with you, permit me to say that I should be glad to see my place filled by a gentleman well and honorably known on both sides of the Atlantic, Gerald Massey, of England. ... In his lyrics he had written well of labor, and I doubt not, he can speak well." That night while Boston heard the social gospel applied to capital and labor, Whittier sat in his study in Amesbury and read Massey's lyrics of labor. IV At the end of his stay in New England, Massey told Fields that he liked the West best of all the parts of the states he had seen, and that he was going back. From Boston he re- traced his steps leisurely across the United States, observing the social and religious conditions. In the first week of April, he lectured three times in San Francisco at Platt's Hall on "The Man Shakespeare, with Something New," his old fav- orite, "Why Does Not God Kill the Devil?" and "The Com- ing Religion." Crowds turned out to hear Massey, but his lecture on the Devil was rather critically received: "It was what might be called a spicy lecture, from the method in which he went rough-shod over everything that many millions of people hold sacred." One paper hinted plagiarism from Miil- ler's Chips from a German Workshop. ". . . One difference there is, however, and that is while Miiller is very slow and cautious in his generalizations on the facts which he believes are re- vealed to him in general religion by means of his philological studies, Massey dashes out uncurbed, and on the most super- 365</page><page sequence="11">CHURCH HISTORY ficial grounds upsets creeds, rends the history of thousands of years, and generally swaggers around the theological field with all the daring of one of those of whom Pope says: 'For fools rush in where angels fear to tread'." The comment on his third lecture by the Alta California concluded: "The finish of the sentences, and the picturesqueness of the periods, was the only thing that appeared to be Mr. Gerald Massey's own. After the lecture the lecturer held an impromptu reception, receiving a large number of both male and female radical believers. Mr. Massey expresses himself as well pleased with his visit to Cali- fornia. He goes east in few days." San Francisco was too conservative theologically to accept Massey's comparative re- ligion. He did, however, make an unforgettable impression, and ten years later on his second visit to California he was received as a prophet. From California Massey returned to Ohio. The Cincinnati Daily Enquirer on Monday morning, April 27, 1874, carried the announcement that "Gerald Massey the great English poet, author and orator, will deliver his three celebrated lectures at Melodeon Hall, April 28, 29 and 30. Subjects: 'Why Does Not God Kill the Devil?' 'A Spirit World Revealed to the Natural World from the Earliest Times by Means of Objective Manifestations,' and 'The Coming Re- ligion.' " Wednesday morning the Cincinnati Daily Enquirer re- ported the first lecture in a rather humorous vein: "Gerald Massey. How he demolished the devil and all his works last night. An answer to the Man Friday's conundrum." Follow- ing this announcement, the lecture was reported as follows: "Mr. Gerald Massey, the Spiritualist, poet and free lance on all religious questions, delivered his lecture entitled 'Why does not God kill the Devil' in Melodeon last night. Mr. Massey's audience was not nearly so large as was to be expected from his fame which had preceded him, but it was one which made up for its lack of size, perhaps, in quality, and embraced among its two hundred, or, may be, even less, a good part of the independent thinkers on religious subjects in the city." Massey began his favorite lecture this time "by quoting the question of the man Friday to Robinson Crusoe, 'If God much strong, much mighty as the devil, why does God not kill the devil? So make man no more wicked?' Defoe, the writer of 366</page><page sequence="12">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA Robinson Crusoe, he said was a Spiritualist, and he asked the question just as any Spiritualist seeking after more truth would ask it." The rest of the lecture was devoted to the '"myths and allegories" of comparative religion which was on the whole, unfamiliar to Cincinnati. "The early religions had their myths interpreted, while we have ours misinterpreted, and a great deal of what has been imposed on the world as God's direct revelation to men is only a mass of inverted myths . . . These parables of the primeval thinkers have been accepted by us as truths . . ." Massey then returned to the literal accept- ance of the Old Testament. "And this . . . comes of taking our history, geography, and versions of these myths from the chronicles of the ancient Jews." The second lecture received this comment from a Cincin- nati paper: "Mr. Massey's lecture at Melodeon Hall last night upon 'A Spirit World Revealed by Objective Manifestations, or the Only Basis of Immortality' was perhaps more enter- taining, more brilliant in the rich, figurative oratory and poetical sentiment peculiarly characteristic of the speaker, more aston- ishing in the extraordinary wealth of erudition brought forward in illustration of its theme, and more interesting to the liberal- minded audience, than that of the previous evening." Again, as in his New York lecture, Massey took the side of Darwin, declared himself an evolutionist, and gave a lecture on com- parative religion. Cincinnati, from the founding of the Western Messenger in 1835, had been looked upon by New England as the pioneer outpost of liberalism. Through this organ the eastern Uni- tarians hoped to leaven the West. It was in Cincinnati also that Emerson had his first hearing in the West. So Massey came with the knowledge that those who arranged for his lectures looked upon him as a missionary in the cause of liberalism. The third lecture was perhaps best received of all. The Cincinnati Commercial reported that "Gerald Massey was honored by another large and intelligent audience at Melodeon Hall last evening. The occasion of the delivery of his lecture on the 'Coming Religion.' The coming religion he conceived and represented to be modern spiritualism, which was not afraid of any new facts. It was purely affirmative and dared to think 367</page><page sequence="13">CHURCH HISTORY freely. The chasm between God and the facts could never be bridged with living spirits." This assertion, made again and again by Massey, proves his reliance upon the writings of Swedenborg, who stressed with vehemence his continuous relation with spirits. Massey then proceeded to elaborate another point, fundamental in Swedenborg's religion: that the essence of religion is to do good. It was not by belief, however, but by active charity, and constant labor, that the objects of the new religion might be carried out. The man who believed in God must show that belief by his works in behalf of his fellow man, the creation of the Almighty. That was the effect of the teachings of Jesus Christ, who, if He had lived today, would have said to those in authority, "Stop this conflict between capital and labor; bring these men together in the spirit of mutual interest and common humanity." Massey further elaborated his interpretation of the Social Gospel: The religion that bore the name of Jesus Christ was no longer worthy of the name. It was a hybrid paganism which, instead of teaching self sacrifice as a means of redemption, sought to obtain salvation by the sacri- fice of everybody but oneself. Instead of a life of self devotion, we have made an apotheosis of selfishness, and were crushing our neighbor into dust. Thus spake the missionary of England's Christian Social- ism, the gospel of Maurice and Kingsley. America listened. V Ten years later, in 1884, Massey was again in America. After reviewing the scenes of his previous lecture tour, meet- ing his old friends, and checking his previous impressions, he reached San Francisco in the latter part of June, en route to Australia. By this time he had come to be looked upon as a prophet. The San Francisco Call asked him for his frank impression of America. The caption of the article is as follows: "A Prophet of Ill. Gerald Massey Upon the Labor Questions of the Day. Dangers from Dynamite-Men Who Fail to Do Their Duty-A Remedy for Threatened Anarchy in America." Under this caption, the report goes: Gerald Massey, the English poet, lecturer, philosopher, and theorist, is at present in this city. A child of poverty and reared in the midst of squalor, Mr. Massey has built for himself a niche in the temple of fame, for he is honored among men as a high example of the possibilities of 368</page><page sequence="14">GERALD MASSEY AND AMERICA mental growth under circumstances of the most disadvantageous nature. A prominent advocate of the laboring classes, and a co-organizer with Professor Maurice, Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hughes of the co-opera- tive system that has already gained such a foothold in Great Britain, Mr. Massey's views upon the relative duties of labor and capital are held as valuable and most worthy of study. He is at present en route to Austra- lia, and tarries with us for the purpose of giving two of his quaint lectures that aroused so much attention in England and in this country. A repre- sentative of The Call met him yesterday and requested an interview upon the subject of labor in this country and the probable outcome of our system of popular government. The Call then quoted Massey as reaffirming his belief in the ultimate co-operation of capital and labour thus: So far as I can see, the only means of securing the peace and pros- perity of a nation will be found in the unity of capital and labor. The workingman revolts against what he believes to be an unjust division of profits, and the unhealthy accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few to the despoiling of the many. In this he is certainly to a great extent right, although it is difficult to say exactly where the line shall be drawn between reason and groundless assertion ... It did seem at one time as though the difficulty would be solved through the help of co-operation; but, unfor- tunately, the moneyed classes did not recognize the value of this remedial agent, and as little good could be accomplished without their aid, the prin- ciple has found small chance of development. Continuing, Massey gave his final prognostication for America: In this land crude individuality is rampant, for each man is, to an alarming extent, a law unto himself, and takes but little heed of anything that is not connected with his own immediate interests. Your men of honor, of brains, and of business experience avoid the paths of public life, and devote themselves exclusively to the amassing of fortunes and the gratifying of their personal whims. With his knowledge of the social and religious situation in Europe and America, he concluded with an appeal to Ameri- cans to do their duty conscientiously as jurors and at the polls. He then pointed out the grave danger to America of the com- ing of labor agitators "from the crowded centres of Europe, and here they are allowed to gather together in your large cities and hatch out rebellion in whatever shape most pleases them. Many of these people are common enemies of mankind, for their only aim is plunder, and their only joy destruction; yet your leaders blindly pass them by and take no measures to prevent what must come if there be no prevention used." Thus, Gerald Massey, poet-prophet bade his farewell to 369</page><page sequence="15">370 CHURCH HISTORY America. Today he is forgotten except as one goes into the story of those who have dreamed of peace and prosperity on this earth. But Massey deserves to be remembered as a fear- less speaker for righteousness, a prophet in the manner of an Amos. One of the active workers in the numerous efforts made in the nineteenth century to bring about a spirit of unselfish co-operation, Massey's contribution to America is by no means the least of his endeavors. Though less widely known than Kingsley and Maurice, it was Massey who prepared the way for the Social Gospel in America.</page></plain_text>
