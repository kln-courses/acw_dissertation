BROWN University of California, Los Angeles GOD ON EARTH: THE WALKING BUDDHA IN THE ART OF SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA*: The Conqueror created a Walk spanning the ten thousand; and golden were the sides of the Walk which was made of jewels. Walking up and down in that, the wise one, him of the thirty-two glorious Marks, Self-Awakened One, Conqueror, shining, walked up and down in the Walk.' T his essay discusses the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni, his life and the religion he founded, and specifically the artistic representations of him performing one important action: walking. By representations of walking I mean the Buddha depicted quasi-anatomically in a walking stance. I will begin by showing that from the earliest Buddhist art on, the Buddha was sometimes represented symbolically as walking. After the invention of the anthropomorphic Buddha image around the first century B.C., however, the Buddha was only very rarely represented as walking. He was never shown in a walking stance as a major iconic image. In narrative relief sculpture the situation is more complicated, but I will show that even in narrative relief sculpture walking images are very rare. The question then arises as to why the walking Buddha was infrequently depicted; and this question becomes even more significant if we review religious texts, historical sources, and contemporary Buddhist practices for evidence of the importance of walking to the Buddha. This analysis will reveal that walking is one of the major defining characteristics of the Buddha Sakyamuni and is an activity that is central in several respects to Buddhism itself. My question then will be this: why, when walking is so central to the meaning of the Buddha and of Buddhism, and was represented symbolically in the earliest Buddhist art, was the Indian artist reluctant to depict the anthropomorphic image in a walking stance? The answer to this will involve the royal symbolism used by the Buddha. Finally, I will turn to Southeast Asia where in Thailand in the thirteenth century, when Buddhism was almost abandoned in India, a three- dimensional walking Buddha image was invented and became popular. I will conclude with suggestions of why and how the walking Buddha was invented. * I wish to thank Prof. Gregory Schopen for a number of helpful comments and references that are incorporated into this paper.

One of the most popular symbols was the wheel, indicating his First Sermon at the Deer Park at Sarnath. It was there that the Buddha first turned and thus set in motion the Wheel of the Law (dharmacakra). A second frequently-depicted symbol was the Bodhi tree, indicating his Enlightenment at Bodh GayS. S"kyamuni sat in meditation at the base of this tree until he understood the nature of reality, formulated his doctrine, and reached Nirvana. In both these important episodes from his life, the Buddha can be imagined as he will be shown in later anthropomorphic representations, as sitting. In some episodes, however, the Buddha was walking, and to represent this action aniconically the artist used a meditation or walking path, a caikrama. It was on such a path that a monk practiced walking meditation. The Buddha spent a week following his Enlightenment at Bodh Gay- walking in meditation on a jewelled promenade (the ratna cahkrama).2 Archaeological remains indicate that at one time the path at Bodh Gaya was covered with a pillared roof and was apparently a shrine to be worshipped.3 The cahkrama and its cover is in fact represented in a relief from Bharhut (fig. i), and thus we know that its worship was apparently as early as any of the other aniconic symbols of the Buddha. That the cahkrama is actually worshipped is indicated on the relief by the flower offerings that cover its top and by the application of hand prints to the front.4 When the artist needed a symbol to represent the Buddha walking in other episodes of his life, it was natural that he should adopt the cahkrama. An example is in a relief from Saifici (fig. 2). This relief illustrates the story of the flooding of the Nairafijan- River, when the Buddha performed the miracle of walking on the surface of the water. The walking Buddha is represented by the path, looking like a rectangular bar, at the lower center of the relief. When the anthropomorphic Buddha image was invented, it was used primarily in two ways: as an icon to be worshipped and in narrative reliefs. As an image to worship, the Buddha is represented as a single figure or a figure flanked by symmetrically arranged attendants. The icon may or may not have a clear reference to an episode from the Buddha's life, or later to one of the 2 As the path exists today it is a brick platform 5 3 feet long, 3 feet 6 inches wide, and 3 feet high. It has i8 lotus flowers (or lotus vases) in a row on top, each representing a footstep of the Buddha. For illustrations and a discussion of the cankrama at Bodh Gayi, see Benimadhab Barua, Gaya and Buddha-Gaya, II (Calcutta: Indian Research Institute, 1934): 25-28 and fig. 24. 3 Ibid., p. 27. Gregory Schopen has pointed out to me that early (Kusina) cult Buddha images were erected, as recordedin dedicatory inscriptions, on the cankramas. See, for example, Epigraphia Indica 9 (I907--o8):290-29I and Epigraphia Indica 24 (i938):21o-212. The reason for this association of image and path is not clear, although it may suggest apossible early importance of "walking" iconic images. General Cunningham did not discover any images associated with the cahkrama at Bodh Gayi when he excavated it in the nineteenth century. A. Cunningham, Mahabodhi or the Great Buddhist Temple Under the Bodhi Tree at Buddha-Gaya (Varanasi: n.d.). It is interesting in this regard that Buddha images are placed today, one at each end, of the cankrama at the Schwegugyi in Pegu (Burma), and are mentioned in fifteenth century inscriptions; the Schwegugyi is a fifteenth-century copy of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya. See Robert L. Brown, "Bodhgaya and South-east Asia", in Bodhgaya: the Site of Enlightenment, Janice Leoshko, ed. (Bombay: Marg, I988):111. 4 The flowers may indicate the steps of the Buddha (see note 2), although flowers, clearly as offerings, are strewn on throne (or altar?) tops in numerous reliefs.

With or without a reference, the images take only three postures: standing, sitting, and reclining. Walking is never used, even in instances when an episode is intended in which the Buddha is walking. An eleventh century stone relief from Eastern India (fig. 3) is an example, as it represents the Buddha's Descent to Earth from Indra's Heaven by means of a ladder-like stair. The scene is identified by the stair perfunctorily indicated by parallel lines below the Buddha, and by the presence of Indra on the right and Brahma on the left, the two Hindu gods who accompanied him in his descent. The artist was satisfied simply to represent the Buddha as standing, rather than actually walking down the stair. If we look next at the narrative depictions that use the anthropomorphic Buddha image, we see that, as with the icons, the artist almost always represented the walking Buddha as a standing figure. Often these Buddhas do not stand as rigidly as in the Descent scene (fig. 3), and sometimes the artist used conventions to suggest the Buddha's walking. The ways in which the images stand and the conventions used depend upon the school and date of the sculpture. Only a few examples of the stances and conventions need be given here, but my point is that in no case are the Buddhas actually depicted in a walking stance; rather, it is always the context that allows us to interpret them as walking, although the context sometimes permits considerable ambiguity. The ambi- guity arises, of course, precisely because there is no walking stance shown. The Buddha's stance in a second-century A. D. Gandharan relief, depicting the Buddha about to be attacked by a group of thugs, dressed as wrestlers hidden behind a wall (fig. 4), probably indicates that he is, or just was, walking: the weight is placed on one leg with the foot turned obliquely; the free leg is slightly bent, with the foot pointed out towards the viewer. In almost all Indian narrative reliefs when the artist wanted to suggest walking he relied on a similar kind of relaxed standing pose. The dehanchement of the Gandharan Buddha, for example, is almost identical to that used some 300oo years later by the artists at Ajanta to indicate walking (fig. 5). In this relief from Cave 19, the Buddha is receiving a bowl from a child. This is the episode of the Buddha walking and being approached by his son, Rahula, who asked his father for his inheritance. It may well be that what often is intended is to depict the Buddha just coming to a stop or pausing in mid-stride. Whether this is so or not, the point remains that the artist, while obviously interested in suggesting walking, could not actually render the Buddha in a walking stance. I mean "could not" in the sense of an implicit or explicit artistic prohibition. One need only look at the hooligan in the Gandharan relief (fig. 4), who is just on the other side of the wall from the Buddha and whose stance and gesture are similar to the Buddha's, to see that the artist did depict other figures in a walking stance. While the relaxed pose was most often used, there were times when the artist attempted other means to suggest walking or at least movement. In a Gandharan relief of the Buddha's Descent (fig. 6), the scene we saw already depicted in the Medieval period Pala stele (fig. 3), the Gandhi- ran artist has produced the standing Buddha three times, at the top, center, and bottom of the ladder, relying on continuous narration to suggest the Buddha's progress.s A second convention 5 K. R. van Kooij has suggested, correctly I believe, that this vertical three-part division indicates heaven, intermediate space, and earth, what he calls (and which is the title of his article) "The Concept of Cosmic Totality in the Ancient Art of India", in Visible Religion: Annualfor Religious Iconography volume IV-V, Approaches to Iconology (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1985-86):40. I do not think, however, that the two interpretations are mutually exclusive, as the Buddha's progress through these realms indicates his cosmic nature. 75</page><page sequence="4">used to suggest walking occurs in both Gandharan and Andhran art. A second-third century A.D. relief from Amarivati represents the episode of the presentation of Buddha's son, Rahula, to his father (fig. 7). To suggest walking the artist has placed a lotus under each of the Buddha's feet, reminding us of the lotuses on top of the caihkrama at Bodh Gaya, mentioned above in note 2, that indicated the Buddha's footsteps. In the relief, Rahula, urged on by his mother, is reaching out to grasp his father's robe, as if in an attempt to hold him back.6 There are other conventions by which the Indian artists suggested walking for the Buddha without using a walking stance, but I want now to introduce the exceptions. I have found a very small group of walking Buddhas in Indian art. The earliest example is from Nigarjunakonda (third century A. D., fig. 8). An exception from that site may not be unexpected considering the unusual interest in movement seen in early Andhra sculpture. The scene shows the Buddha entering a deer park to confront a risi. A second early example of a walking Buddha is on a tiny (only i i. I cm. high) stone portable shrine, carved perhaps in the fifth century in Gandhara, or at least in that area.' The Buddha, oddly dressed as a bodhisattva, is subduing the mad elephant Nal-giri, an episode in which the texts describe the Buddha as walking while begging alms.8 Two or three hundred years later (ca. eighth century A. D.) there are walking Buddhas carved in ivory from Kashmir. The two largest, each being 7.3 cm. high, were set in a tiny wooden shrine and flanked a seated Buddha.' Finally, examples occur frequently in Nepali manuscript paintings of the Buddha's life scenes from about the eleventh century. The most often depicted scene with the walking Buddha is the Nilagiri subjugation.10 All of these exceptions are small, subsidiary figures. They are all, except for the Andhra example, confined along the northern edge of the subcontinent. Their locations outside of India proper must suggest a loosening of the restrictions (however manifested) felt in India itself. II. To sum up what we have learned from the artistic material: the walking Buddha was clearly of importance to the Indian artist and his patrons. In early Buddhist art at Bhdrhut and Safici the walking Buddha is represented symbolically by a meditation path. We know that the path itself was worshipped. Yet, after the invention of the anthropomorphic Buddha image, the artist, while retaining an interest in the episodes of the Buddha walking, used a standing pose to suggest walking rather than depict the act itself. We are justified, I think, at this point in asking why the walking stance was avoided. The aptness of this question is underscored when we realize that 6 "Accordingly Prince Rahula went to the Exalted One [the Buddha]. ... When the Exalted One had finished his meal, he pronounced the words of thanksgiving, arose from his seat, and departed. Prince Rahula followed in the footsteps of the Exalted One, saying, 'Monk, give me my inheritance; monk, give me my inheritance.'" [Dhammapadatthakatha] Dhammapada Commentary, E. W.

Lerner, The Flame and the Lotus, No. 30, pp. 86-89. 76</page><page sequence="5">walking is central to the conception of the Buddha and to Buddhism, the evidence for which I will turn to next. We shall see that in this light, the lack of the walking image becomes more problematic. Buddhist texts represent Sakyamuni's early life as filled with pleasures and enjoyment, befitting the son of a wealthy ruler. But punctuating this life of ease were events that prefigured his eventual renunciation of the palace for the life of a wandering mendicant. Even at the time of his conception, and later after his birth, brahmin soothsayers predicted that he would become either a universal monarch (a cakravartin) or a great religious teacher (a Buddha); the choice was Sakyamuni's. This interplay between the secular ruler and his religious counterpart is a constant theme in Buddhism. At this point, it is S"kyamuni's decision to abandon the royal life for the religious path, and the resultant renunciation and flight from the palace, that is important to us. When the 29-year-old prince decided to leave his home and family, he rode his faithful horse Kanthaka out of the gates of the city, dismounted, cut off his long hair, and removed his jewelry, turban, and royal attire. Each of these actions clearly symbolizes his renunciation of the royal life, but I wish to stress the dismounting from his horse, as Sakyamuni never again, to my knowledge, rode on any animal, nor in any vehicle other than, perhaps, a ferry boat." He only walked, and he walked constantly. Kanthaka represents the vehicle or means of locomotion appropriate to royalty that S"kyamuni abandoned for his own feet, the means of locomotion appropriate to a religious mendicant and the common man. It is interesting to note that after Kanthaka returned to the Palace he died of a broken heart. There was, this indicates, no turning back for S"kyamuni.12 Six years after S"kyamuni took up the life of a wandering ascetic, he reached Enlightenment, and became the Buddha. He taught his doctrine for some 45 years, and died at the age of 80. The texts that elicit the details of his life during this 5 I-year period, from renunciation to death, stress walking in several ways. First, he constantly traveled from town to town, usually with a band of followers, teaching his doctrine. He spent only the rainy season, the three-month period when roads were impassable, in one locality, and even then would continue the "ideal" of a wandering beggar by going into the local town each morning to beg. Second, certain important events of his life, often miraculous in nature, took place while he was walking. We have already seen a number of these depicted in the art - the Descent from Indra's Heaven, the Subjugation of the Elephant Nal-giri, and Rahula's Presentation - but there are many others. Finally, not only did a number of life episodes take place while the Buddha was walking, but his footsteps themselves could produce miracles. The Asokdvaddna, for example, states that: 1 This is certainly generally true, but one must expect exceptions, particularly in late Buddhist traditions. Ronald Bernier, for example, has told me of a late Nepali painting of the Buddha riding on an elephant. It should be recalled that the Buddha forbade his monks to ride in vehicles except under certain conditions, as when they were ill. See [Mahavagga] Vinaya Texts, part II, T. W. Rhys Davids and Herman Oldenberg, trans., The Sacred Books of the East, IV (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1899): 26-27. 2 That the prince would choose to be a wandering mendicant after abandoning his royal life is not in itself surprising, insofar as that was at the time, and still is, in India one of the alternatives available for someone pursuing a spiritual life. For the Hindus, it is the path of a Sannya-sin ("abandoning"), the fourth and last stage of man's life when, in old age, he gives up his home, family, and identity to lead the life of an ascetic. But the Hindu gods, except for Siva, do not particularly participate in this "ideal". Even for Siva, it is only in his role as Bhairava, specifically in the form of Bhiksatana (the Supreme Beggar) that walking becomes a defining characteristic, and there it is more in the role of pilgrim than mendicant. Walking was for the Buddha and the monastic order he founded of much more significance than it was for the Hindus and their gods, although both shared the tradition of the wandering ascetic. 77</page><page sequence="6">Whenever the Blessed Buddhas set their feet down on the threshold stone of a city gate with a resolute mind, it is usual for various marvels to occur. The blind recover their sight, the deaf are able to hear, the lame can walk again... Elephants trumpet, horses neigh, bulls bellow, parrots, myna birds, cuckoos, pheasants, and peacocks warble delightfully...13 and the text goes on to specify many other marvels. The Buddha's constant wandering was not simply because he had adopted the life of an itinerant mendicant. An ascetic beggar may walk aimlessly; the Buddha clearly did not. For one thing, he wandered in order to teach his doctrine. The evangelical character of Buddhism sets it apart from other indigenous South Asian religions and helps to explain its popularity and spread to other areas of Asia. To proselytize was Buddha's mission on earth. When S"kyamuni found Enlightenment at Bodh Gaya he had the option to enter Nirvina immediately or to teach his law or dharma on earth. The god Brahma pleaded with him: "Rise, oh hero... please walk in the world. Oh Bhagavat, please preach the Dharma."14 Buddha, of course, agreed, and later he in his turn told his monks: "Go ye now, O Bhikkus, and wander,... for the gain, and for the welfare of gods and men. Let not two of you go the same way. Preach, O Bhikkus, the doctrine..."15 There is a second reason, besides proselytizing, for Buddha's constant peregrinations. Buddhism shared with Hinduism a strong pilgrimage tradition. In both religions, India has a sacred geography where certain places function as "crossings" or tirthas, locations where the transition between earth and heaven, the profane and the sacred, can be made easily. The more famous of these places, such as Vrarnasi, are visited by a constant flow of pilgrims. For the Buddhists, the pilgrimage sites are often places associated with episodes of the Buddha's life. In effect, the Buddha had to keep moving in order to be in different and widely spaced locations for various life episodes, thus establishing future pilgrimage sites. Note, for example, that following his Enlightenment at Bodh Gaya he walked to Sarnith, a distance of well over ioo00 miles, to give his First Sermon.16 To summarize, I have attempted briefly to outline ways in which walking was of importance to the concept of the Buddha. First, I suggested that it was a significant symbol of his rejection of the royal life and thus of his alternative destiny as a Universal King. Second, the texts were found to stress walking in a variety of ways, some of which we have seen taken up by the artist but without using a walking stance. And third, the locative and evangelical nature of Buddhism offered two underlying explanations for why walking was emphasized in the texts. 13 [Asokavadadna] John S. Strong, The Legend of King Aioka: A Study and Translation of the Asokavadana (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983): 198-199. 14 Hajime Nakamura, Gotama Buddha (Los Angeles: Buddhist Books International, I977): 69 [this is Nakamura's translation from the Majjhimanikaya].

V, (London: Humphrey Milford, i926): ii9. 15[Mahavagga] Vinaya Texts, part I, Rhys Davids and Oldenberg, trans., p. I1i2. 16 I am, of course, not arguing that the historic Sakyamuni visited all these places in order to consciously set up pilgrimage sites; his life as we know it is "mythical" and the locations for many life events were, one may suppose, selected by the authors of the texts. Furthermore, the interest in identifying places associated with the actual presence of Sakyamuni continued as Buddhism spread to areas far from his central Indian homeland. Stories that Skyamuni had visited a place most often involve his magical arrival, usually by flying through the air, in order to implant his footprint. It is the discovery and identification of the stone footprints, often long after his visit, that prove he was there. 78</page><page sequence="7">Fig. i Caikrama. Bharrhit, early Ist century B.

Now I will ask the question with which we began: Why, when walking is so central to the meaning of the Buddha and of Buddhism, and was represented symbolically in the earliest Buddhist art, was the Indian artist reluctant to depict the anthropomorphic image in a walking stance? To begin our answer, I will point out again the close and complex interplay between the concept and symbolism of the cakravartin or Universal Ruler and the Buddha."7 Sakyamuni rejected the royal path. He says in the Suttanipdta: I am neither Brahman nor prince, Nor even a bourgeois; I take my place with common folk. Without a penny, thoughtful, I trudge. In the monk's robe, without a home I go, With shorn hair and soul serene, With no truck in human affairs My caste is no longer in season.18 At the same time, however, the texts and art adopt royal symbolism for the Buddha and make it clear that he is superior to the cakravartin.19 There is, I believe, a contradiction between these two aspects of the Buddha, his rejection of the royal life for that of a penniless, wandering mendicant (on the one hand) and his depiction as a supramundane universal conqueror (on the other). While these two opposing characterizations can, and do, exist side by side in the texts,20 in the art it is the royal and supramundane nature that predominates. It is Sakyamuni as king and god, identified primarily in the art by his laksana and by royal symbols, who acts in the narrative scenes; and it is his kingly and godly character that, I think, kept the artist from depicting him as walking. Kings and gods do not usually walk. Kings ride on animals or in vehicles. To dismount is a clear indication of subservience or deference, as when a king approaches Buddha on foot. Gods usually either fly or, as with Hindu deities, ride on animal vehicles or vahanas. Furthermore, there is a consistent attempt to separate the gods from the earth: they sit on thrones or lotuses, their feet drawn up or on footstools. The Buddha was equally a god, and to represent him trudging in the dust was unacceptable to the artist and his audience.21 This reluctance is reflected 17 The relation of the cakravartin and the Buddha has been explored by many scholars, among whom are E. Senart, Essai sur la legende du Buddha (2nd ed., Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1882): 87-160; Frank Reynolds, "The Two Wheels of the Dhamma: A Study of Early Buddhism," in Barnwell L. Smith, ed., The Two Wheels of Dhamma: Essays on the Theravada Tradition in India and Ceylon (Chambersburg, Pa.: American Academy of Religion, 1972): 6-30; and S. J. Tambiah, World Renouncer and World Conqueror: A Study of Buddhism and Polity in Thailand against a Political Background (London: Cambridge University Press, 1976). 18 This is Alfred Foucher's translation in his The Life of the Buddha According to the Ancient Texts and Monuments of India, trans. by Simon Brangier Boas (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1963): I94. 19 Andre' Bareau, "The Superhuman Personality of Buddha and Its Symbolism in the Mahdparinirvanasutra of the Dharmaguptaka," in Joseph M. Kitagawa and Charles H. Long, eds., Myths and Symbols: Studies in Honor of Mircea Eliade (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1969): 16. 20 "If, in the greatest part of the tale [the Mahiparinirvanasu-tra]the Beatific [the Buddha] is depicted as a real man, submitting to most of the vicissitudes inherent in the human condition and behaving as a human being, he appears in rather numerous and especially important passages as a superman, as a divine personage..." (Ibid., p. io) 21 The desire for a dirtless Buddha is reflected as well by one of his 32 marks. As given in the Pancavimiatisdhasrika Prajn-aparamita it is: "His skin is smooth and delicate, i.e. water and dust do not cleave to his body." [Pafcavim- /atisdhasrikd Prajtaparamitd] The Large Sutra of Perfect Wisdom with the Divisions of the Abhisamayalaizkdra, Edward Conze, trans. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975): 533. 95</page><page sequence="24">in the belief that Buddha "hovers just above the ground and to touch it with his feet is an act of volition, of grace..."22 Frequently the Buddha leaves behind a footprint when he touches the ground. There was, I believe, a clear connection between walking and footprints, and both of these with the laksana that identify the Buddha as a superman. The second of the 32 laksana is a wheel (cakra) mark on the bottom of the Buddha's soles: "on the soles of his feet, wheels appear thousand-spoked, with tyre and hub, in every way complete and well divided."23 The wheel is depicted on the soles of the feet of numerous Buddha images, and is usually the central and largest sign on the footprints (cf. fig. 14). The wheel itself is one of the most popular aniconic Buddhist symbols, representing the Buddha's First Sermon at Sarnith and his teachings (dharma). It also, however, represents the dharma of the universal monarch or cakravartin ("turning of the wheel"). The wheel is the first of a cakravartin's Seven Jewels or emblems of sovereignty.24 In the Dighanikaya, in which the most important Pali version of the cakravartin myth is given, the wheel is described as jeweled and with a thousand spokes.25 It spontaneously appears to the cakravartin, as an indication of his righteousness, and then begins rolling in all directions until it covers the four continents and thus the universe. The king and his army follow the wheel, but no battles need be fought as wherever the wheel appears (which is, of course, everywhere) the people spontane- ously accept the king's sovereignty. The symbolism of the wheel in this myth can be variously interpreted.26 Certainly it has solar implications.27 It also was associated with the wheels of the king's war chariot, the tracks of which mark off the king's domain. When the Buddha turned the Wheel of his Doctrine at Sarnith, he started it rolling in a similar manner to conquer the world for Buddhism. In a sense, the Buddha (and by extension his monks) moved the Wheel along themselves as they wandered in order to teach. A Gandharan relief is interesting in this context, as it shows the Buddha literally 22 H. Shorto, "The Stupa as Buddha Icon in South East Asia," in Mahaydnist Art After A.D. 9oo (London: University of London, n. d.): 8o. Shorto's reference is to popular contemporary Southeast Asian belief, but it is reflected in the texts as well. The Mahivastu, for example, says: "The Buddha walked without touching the ground for even as much as the width of four fingers, and yet the impress of the wheel-marks on his feet, complete with a thousand spokes, hubs, and every part, was visible on the ground." See The Mahivastu, J. J. Jones, trans. (London: Luzac &amp; Company, Ltd., I949): I, 257. Hindu gods as well are frequently said to hover above the ground. A graphic depiction of this trait is in the Nala and Damayanti story in the Mahabhdrata when Damayanti, unable to pick the human Nala, her lover, from four gods who had taken his form, pleaded with them to reveal the real Nala. In response the gods "displayed their ability to wear the marks of divinity. She saw all the gods without sweat, with unblinking eyes, with spruce garlands, without dust, and standing without touching the ground. And the Nisadhan [Nala] stood revealed by his shadow, his faded garland, his dustiness and sweatiness, and the blinking of his eyes, while he touched the ground." J. A.

This is specifically the scene of the First Sermon at Sarnath, with the five future monks standing on the proper right in adoration as the Buddha approaches rolling the dharmacakra. It is his First Teaching and the Wheel of the Law is now turning. I am assuming that the Buddha is walking in this relief because of the rolling Wheel and because of the Buddha's nearly frontal and relaxed posture, which, as we have seen, is used to suggest walking. Notice as well that, although the relief is damaged, the Buddha has his hand placed on top of the rim of the Wheel. The imagery of moving the Wheel as he walked is certainly appropriate to his peripatetic life of teaching. May we also suggest that the Wheel marks on his feet would have left imprints as he walked, marking off his religious realm as the cakravartin's wheel defined his secular realm? A second of the 32 laksana is of relevance to the Buddha's walking. The Lakkana Suttanta describes it as: "He hath feet with level tread,""28 and in a later text, the PaIcavim.atisahasrika Prajfadparamita as "The Lord's feet are well-placed, i.e. he places the entire soles of his feet evenly on the ground, just as a round basket which, when tipped up moves down and when tipped down moves up."'29 Finally, a Thai text, the Pathomsomphotikatha,30 elaborates this laksana in this way: [The Buddha] has the soles of his feet full fleshed and perfectly flat, like unto golden sandals. They move, not alternately, like the feet of ordinary men, but they both touch the ground at the same time, and leave it at the same time. Nor does one end of the foot touch the ground before the other, but the whole sole touches the ground at the same moment.31 This peculiar mark was correctly interpreted as early as 1882 by Emile Senart as indicating Buddha's ability literally to flatten everything in his path,32 an idea expressed as well in some texts.33 But from the earliest depictions of the Buddha's footprints, it is clear that the artists interpreted this mark as describing a perfectly flat foot, so that the print left is "level." This interpretation is seen on the feet of most reclining Buddha images as well, the soles of which appear as if if cut out of plywood. The exact historical interplay between the marks and their representations in art is complex. It is thought that the list, at least that of the 32 marks, is brahmanical and pre-Buddhist.34 It is likely that the lists appeared in Buddhist texts before the invention of the anthropomorphic Buddha image.35 The footprints may have been the artist's aniconic interpretation of this mark. Of particular interest to us is that the artist's adoption of this mark for an anthropomorphic image 28 [Dighanikaya] Part III, T. W. and C. A. F. Rhys Davids, trans., p. 137. 29 [Paicavim.iatisahasrika Prajnaparamitd], The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom with the Divisions of theAbhisamayalaiz- kdra, E. Conze, trans. and ed., pp. 583-584. 30 The Pathomsomphotikatha is, in its present form, datable to 184 5; but possibly may date back to as early as the 8th cen- tury. See George Coedes, "Une vie indochinoise du Buddha: La Pathamasambodhi," in Melange d'Indianisme a la memoire de Louis Renou (Paris: Publications de l'institut de civilisation indienne, 1968): 217-227. 31 Henry Alabaster, The Wheel of the Law (London: Trubner &amp; Co., 1870): iio [trans. from the Pathomsomphotikatha]. 32 Senart, Essai sur la legende du Buddha, pp. 143- 144. Senart connects this laksana with the wheels on the soles, which he stresses are sun symbols: "l'intention premiere est bien moins de representer la forme des pieds que de marquer leur action merveilleuse sur le monde. C'est I'expression imagee des rayons lumineux qui, sans peine et sans effort, se posent egalement dans les profondeurs et sur les cimes, qui, d'un pas toujours stir, vont visiter les valides et les monts." 33 "As he [the Buddha] came into the city, the depressions in the ground rose up so that the whole surface was on the same level" The Mahavastu, I, J. J. Jones, trans.: 256-257. 34 Senart, Essai sur la Ilgende du Buddha, pp. 87-124. 35 For example in the Lakkana Suttanta, which robably dates to the 3rd century B. C. 97</page><page sequence="26">would have made the walking stance impossible, as the Buddha could not bend his foot and be depicted with his heel raised. Let me now summarize the answer to our question of why the walking Buddha is absent from Indian art. From the beginning of its appearance, the anthropomorphic Buddha image was not that of a human being but clearly that of a god. While the Buddha had divested himself of his high caste and specifically of his royal and secular destiny, it was royal symbolism that the Indian artist adopted in his attempt to show the Buddha as a god. The depiction of Buddha as a god in artistic representations of his earthly and often very human life-scenes usually offered little problems; an exception, however, was the frequent walking episodes, as walking was inappro- priate for gods and kings. Furthermore, it may be that the laksana of the "level tread" was interpreted as "flat-footed," which would have been an impediment to representing a walking Buddha. In a sense, therefore, I am proposing that the non-walking aspect of the Buddha may be seen as one of his visible royal attributes. IV. With the extreme rarity of the walking Buddha in South Asian art in mind, we can now turn to the art of Thailand where walking Buddha images abound. The walking three-dimensional Buddha icon was an invention of the Thais, probably created at Sukhothai in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century. These walking images have a standard posture that has remained basically unchanged. One of the earliest and finest examples, an over life-size bronze fourteenth- century image now at Wat Benchamabopit in Bangkok (figs. Ioa, b, c, and d), shows how walking, with one leg bent to the rear and the heel of the foot raised, is indicated; but the pose does not appear naturalistic. In actuality, the lack of realism is due perhaps more to the Buddha's supernatural and metaphorical anatomy than to the pose itself. As Alexander Griswold and others have discussed at length,36 the Sukhothai style Buddha image incorporates a number of anatomical similes, such as "head like an egg," in an unusually literal fashion. With legs likened to those of an antelope, and thighs like banana tree stems, the Buddha's heavy legs press so tightly together they appear to stick, so that the legs are knock-kneed and all movement is from the knees down. The right arm, "as round, smooth, and free from irregularities or veins, as a well made candle,"'37 hangs serpent-like. The Buddha's appearance becomes therefore non-naturalis- tic. But the body's pose, rather than its form, is quite realistic and can be easily imitated. The robe may strike one initially as adding to the impression of non-naturalism. It clings to the body in the wet-drapery convention and forms a thin web that connects the legs - very much as if the body has been packaged by freeze-drying. Again, however, looking at the legs from a variety of angles (figs. ioa-d), one can see how effectively the robe creates, rather than hinders, a sense of motion, even down to the tiny hem ends that curl forward with the robe's swinging. The immediate artistic sources, often pointed out, for such three-dimensional images as the Wat Benchamabopit Buddha (figs. Ioa-d), were the walking Buddha images in relief at Sukhothai itself.38 In other words, the assumption is that the three-dimensional images follow in 36 See, for example, Theodore Bowie, ed., The Arts of Thailand, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1960): 9I-92 (this section written by A. B. Griswold). 37 Alabaster, The Wheel of the Law, p. 114 [translated from the Pathomsomphotikatha]. 38 See, for example, T. Bowie, ed., The Arts of Thailand, p. 92 (this section written by A. B. Griswold). 98</page><page sequence="27">time and are modeled on earlier relief examples. Evidence for this is primarily the fact that the reliefs explain certain formal characteristics of the three-dimensional images. One of the earliest walking Buddhas in relief is a monumental example done in laterite and stucco from Chalieng that dates probably to around 13oo and the reign of King Ram Kamheng (fig. II).39 As very little Sukhothai art can be assigned to a time before Ram Kamheng's reign, which began in 1279, this is an "early" work. If we compare it to a bronze of perhaps fifty years later their striking similarity is quite obvious when seen from the same angle (cf. figs. Ioa and i i). The major difference is that the torso of the relief is turned more to the front. The relief image especially helps to explain the placement of the legs and robe; the robe's being flattened onto the stele against which the legs are clearly displayed makes sense for an image in relief. It is rather surprising how well it works when transferred to a three-dimensional representation, although there is a tendency, when seen from the front, for the Buddha's legs to be overly compressed which, along with the assymetrical robe and heavy thighs, causes the three-dimensional images sometimes to appear unstable (fig. Iob). There is no indication of the passage of a great deal of time between relief and three- dimensional images. The favored medium used for the icons in the round was apparently bronze, and it has been asked how the Thais could have learned casting techniques to produce such large and fine images as the Wat Benchamabopit Buddha.40 The source of the technical facility is indeed a question, but the fully developed three-dimensional form might be explained by now- lost wooden images.41 In other words, the Thai artists might have developed the images in the round first in wood, as the extant bronzes all take a fully developed form that does not change. Whatever the time span may have been between the images in relief and those in the round, what was the source for the original reliefs? And why their importance? As far as I know, the only suggestion has been a rather vague reference to Sinhalese or Burmese art, specifically mural paintings, and figures of the Buddha descending from Indra's Heaven on a ladder-like stair.42 Artistic and religious influences from Sri Lanka and Burma were importatnt at this time, as we shall see, but as far as I can determine, the Sinhalese and Burmese Buddhas descend from the Heaven as they do in numerous scenes in India, with both feet together. Nevertheless, art from Pagan in Burma remains a'likely source for the Sukhothai walking Buddha reliefs.43 The possible connection is not with Buddha figures in the Descent murals there, however, but with walking Buddhas in high relief carving.44 Still the Pagan artist, like his Indian counterpart, relied on conventions to indicate walking on these reliefs. The usual convention was, as in figure 12, to show the robe baring one shoulder and swung to the Buddha's left side. In this particular example, which is from the Nanda Temple and thus supposedly dates to around I105 A.D. (and therefore almost two centuries before the earliest Thai relief examp- les), the Buddha's feet are awkwardly placed on two different levels, causing the left leg to be 39 For the dating of the Chalieng relief see Griswold, Towards a History of Sukhodaya Art (Bangkok: The Fine Arts Department, 1967): 12. 40 Luang Boribal Buribhand and Griswold, Thai Images of the Buddha (Bangkok: The Fine Arts Department, 1972): 9- 1o. 41 I know of at least one life-size wood Buddha that may be from the Sukhothai period in a private collection. 42 See, for example, Jean Boisselier, The Heritage of Thai Sculpture (New York: John Weatherhill, Inc., 1975): 133, and Bowie, ed., The Arts of Thailand, p. 93 (this section written by A. B. Griswold). 43 For a discussion of the historical links betwen Sukhothai and Pagan, see Griswold and Prasert na Nagara, "King L6daiya of Sukhodaya and His Contemporaries", Journal of the Siam Society, 6o, part I (January, 1972): 40-47. 44 See Gordon H.

While this additional adjustment to indicate walking appears to be a "failure", the artist may have wanted to represent something specific. While there is little formal similarity between the Pagan walking Buddhas and those from Sukhothai, and the Pagan images are not represented walking anatomically but merely conven- tionally, they are like those from Sukhothai in being more iconic and often more removed from any narrative context. That is, individual walking images occur at Pagan, as at Sukhothai, that make no apparent reference to any specific life scene of the Buddha.45 Somewhat surprisingly the image that I have found to be closest formally to the Sukhothai reliefs is not from Sri Lanka or Burma, but from India. It is on an architectural fragment from Nalanda- in Eastern India and dates to about the late twelfth century (fig. 13). The Indian image is very close to the Chalieng relief (fig. i1i), except that the heel is not raised. We are still dealing with a convention. What we can conclude in a search for the formal sources of the Sukhothai relief walking Buddha is that there appears to be no obvious immediate prototype. To create monumental walking images in relief, and even more so life-size images in the round, is in this light indeed an innovation. Yet while there were no close prototypes as such, we can at least say that conceptual models for such walking images were present in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in areas to which Sukhothai had access, most specifically Eastern India and Burma. V. Evidence from Sukhothai itself for the invention and meaning of the walking Buddha is in some ways equally inconclusive. Griswold has suggested that the huge Chalieng Buddha we have been discussing (fig. i1i) could be an idealized portrait of King Ram Kamheng. "At least" Griswold writes, "its simplicity and its dignity accord well with what we know of him from his inscrip- tions.'46 There is, I think, no real support for this identification, but Griswold's interest in connecting the invention to a local political or religious statement is, if one will pardon the pun, a step in the right direction. Actually, Griswold made a much more fruitful suggestion in a 1953 article when he associated, correctly I think, the walking Buddha with the cult of the Buddha's footprint.47 45 These are ibid., Pls. 308a-d and 314a. 46 Griswold, Towards a History of Sukhodaya Art, p. I2. 47 Griswold, "The Buddhas of Sukhodaya," Archives of the Chinese Art Society ofAmerics 7 (I953): 23-29. Griswold writes that "We can easily guess why images of the Walking Buddha were popular at Sukhodaya, and what their particular significance was. They represent the Missionary Buddha, the Buddha engaged upon those tireless peregrinations in which he made such vast numbers of converts among gods and men-and demons" (p. 27). Griswold expands this idea at some length, saying that the walking Buddha leaves his footprint "as a record of his peaceful conquest" (p. 28). Yet there is no evidence that the Thais regarded the "Missionary Buddha" in any special way. Without inscriptional or other specific evidence, Griswold's argument remains purely, as he says, a "guess." Certainly the concept of the "Missionary Buddha" was known in Burma, and for that matter, in most Buddhist countries, without producing walking Buddha images. Why assume, then, that it explains the popularity and meaning of the Thai walking Buddha? Furthermore, Griswold has proposed other meanings for the walking Buddha. In The Arts of Thailand (1960) he suggests that the large walking Buddha in relief, like the Chalieng image (our fig. i1i), was invented because: "Buddhist literature lists four postures (irydpatha) in which the Buddha may be depicted-walking, standing, seated and reclining. We know the list aroused the interest of the Sukhodaya sculptors, or of their patrons, because at certain monuments each of the four postures is illustrated by a large stucco figure on one of the four walls. This was the first time that sculpture needed to make a sharp distinction between the walking Buddha and the Buddha standing still" (pp. 92-93)- Needless to say, these four postures were known in India, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere, and I know of no evidence why they might have become so popular in Thailand as to necessitate the invention of walking images. The opportunity to Ioo</page><page sequence="29">Surprisingly footprints do not occur in Southeast Asia until the eleventh century at the earliest. These early footprints are found at Pagan in Burma.48 In Thailand footprints appear for the first time in Sukhothai art, in other words at about the same time as the walking Buddha images (thirteenth-fourteenth centuries), while the Cambodian examples are even later; Bois- selier suggests the sixteenth century.49 The Thais may have gotten the footprint cult from Burma. Griswold proposes that the footprints were introduced only in 1341 when two monks returned to Sukhothai from studying at Matarban in the kingdom of Ramafifiadesa in Burma.50 I am not sure the cult need be tied so specifically to this event, as close connections between Sukhothai and Ramafifiadesa go back to Ram Kamheng's reign over 5o years earlier, that is, to the period of the earliest Sukhothai art." Whatever the first source was for the cult of the footprint at Sukhothai, footprint worship became extremely popular very quickly. King Lidaiya had, for example, several footprints installed on hill tops around Sukhothai in 1360, these being copies he had made of the famous footprint on Mount Sumanakuita, that is Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka.52 This print was made when the Buddha came flying through the air to press his foot on the mountain's top. Footprints, particularly such natural ones as on Adam's Peak, frequently are found on mountain tops.53 There are numerous references in Buddhist texts, as I have said, to Buddha leaving his footprint by walking,54 but artistic evidence of their association is almost totally absent in South and Southeast Asian art. The artistic evidence for their connection in Thailand is therefore of greater importance than the few examples might suggest. One piece of evidence is a damaged Sukhothai-period metal footprint originally from Kamphaeng Phet (fig. 14). The rim around the depict the four postures in Thai art might just as well have come because of the invention, for whatever reason, of the walking figure. Another meaning for the walking Buddha is proposed by Griswold in Towards a History of Sukhodaya Art (1967), where he believes the walking and standing Buddha images, with their different modes of wearing the robe, symbolized different sects at Sukhothai: "...the standing images symbolized the Nagaravisi, the walking images the Arafifiav-si" (p.24). Again, this is an assumption on Griswold's part. And, as I mention in the text, he proposed that at least some of the walking Buddhas were idealized royal portraits. I do not intend to pin Griswold down to any one of these theories, or even to question if he believes the images have all these meanings, or if the theories represent changes of mind. His suggested meanings are clever and helpful. My own discussion that follows in the text began as an attempt to judge the evidence for Griswold's, and others', ideas for the invention and meaning of the walking Buddha. I found that the bold, unequivocal statements lacked extant support (that does not, of course, necessarily mean they are incorrect); what does emerge from the evidence is something considerably less well defined: a web of suggestions that connects walking, footprints, and popular religious and elitist imagery. 48 U Mya, "A note on the Buddha's foot-prints in Burma," Annual Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India, Part Two (Delhi: Manager of Publications, 19i6): 322. 49 J.

These Buddhas, named by inscriptions,55 are Buddhas of the Past, that is, Buddhas who preceded Sakyamuni. Thirteen figures remain on the broken rim identified as the first 13 of 27 Buddhas who preceded Sakyamuni, going in order from Tanhamkara to Padumuttara.56 Presumedly, therefore, there would have been 14 other Buddhas in the now-lost portion of the rim, bringing the total to 27, or if Sikyamuni was included, 28. The association of the Buddhas of the Past, in walking postures, with a footprint is probably a reference to the act of implanting a footprint that each historic Buddha performs at Safikisya in India upon descending from Indra's Heaven (Trayastrihna).57 This reference, with the connec- tion between walking and footprints, is explicitly seen in a later Thai bronze (dated 1482, fig. Iy) in which the walking Buddha is actually shown planting his footprint within a series of larger ones. The scene is the Buddha's descent. The decreasing size of the footprint is due to the decreasing size of the last few historic Buddhas, with Sakyamuni being the smallest. Thus as each of these Buddhas descended he placed his smaller foot in the larger prints of his predecessors.58 The Descent from Heaven was a popular scene in Sukhothai art if we can judge from a few extant stucco reliefs; probably much more extensive wall murals existed that are now totally lost.59 The most frequently published relief, as it is the most complete today, is on the Coral-Tree Pond Monastery (Wat Trapang Thong Lang) (fig. 16). Indeed, it shows the Buddha descending by walking, but the figure is placed against a highly stylized step design to which he is not naturalistically integrated. The only other narrative of which I am aware in which the walking Buddha was used at Sukhothai was on a second relief at the Coral-Tree Pond Monastery of Buddha performing the fire and water miracle (yamakapatihariya), a display that also involved walking miraculously in the air (fig. I7).60 This walking image is, like the descending images, rather awkwardly plastered against the scene. In other words, it is apparent that the artist is ss Prachumsilacaryk phakhthi 3 (1965 ?): 92. 56 The number of Buddhas before Sikyamuni varies depending upon the text; 24 are often named, as they predicted Sakyamuni's Buddhahood and immediately preceded him. There are three additional Buddhas who are sometimes added to the 24: Tanhamkara, Medhamkara, and Saranamkara. These raise the number to 27, and as these three Buddhas are named on the extant portion of the footprint, one can assume there were originally 27 Buddhas depicted. The 27 past Buddhas are named, for example, in the Nidadnakatha.

The Buddhavarnsa, for example, begins the reduction from the 19th Buddha, Vipassin, who was 80 cubits tall. The sequence goes then Sikhin (no. 20): 70 cubits; Vessabhu (no. 21): 60 ratanas (=cubits); Kakusandha (no. 22): 40 cubits; Konagamana (no. 23): 3o cubits; Kassapa (no. 24): 20 cubits; and Sakyamuni (no. 25): 18 cubits.

The meaning and source of the imagery did not come, therefore, from the artist's interest in producing a figure to narrate various walking episodes. Any suggestion that the Descent from Heaven scenes were the source for the walking Thai Buddha may be reversing the sequence.61 The popularity of the Descent may be in itself partly a result of the importance of the act the Buddha performed at its end, the planting of his footprint. There is some interesting support for not necessarily seeing the walking images as used for those narrative scenes when Buddha's walking is stressed. A third stucco relief on the Coral-Tree Pond Monastery represents the Buddha subduing the Elephant Nilagiri (fig. 18). The figure of the elephant is destroyed today, but the Buddha and Ananda, his most beloved disciple, are clearly shown. The Buddha, however, does not walk, as he does in numerous Nepali manu- scripts; rather he stands with both feet together. All three reliefs on the Coral-Tree Pond Monastery, therefore, are of scenes in which the texts speak of the Buddha as walking. This choice must have been purposeful. But in two, the Descent and the Fire and Water Miracle, the walking Buddha was used; in the Elephant Subjugation, the artist reverted to the standing-image convention. The prototype for the Coral-Tree Pond Subjugation relief is easy to identify. The model is, as in figure g19, from the Pala period of Eastern India. This image dates, according to van Lohui- zen-de Leeuw, to the early tenth century.62 1 am using it as an example because it is the famous P'ra Sila image now kept at Wat Chieng Man in Chiangmai. According to an eighteenth century Thai chronicle it came from Bihar in India, but via Sri Lanka, Burma, and Savankalok. Savan- kalok puts the image within the area controlled by Sukhothai. Could the P'ra Sila image have been revered even during the Sukhothai period and been the source for the "conservative" walk- ing convention used for the Nilagiri scene? This is admittedly pure speculation, but we can at least say that the Sukhothai artist was not committed to the use of the walking icon even in walk- ing scenes. With the association of the Sukhothai walking icon and footprint in mind, let us return to the walking Buddha from Pagan of around I100oo (fig. 12). When Gordon Luce published it he noted that "the Buddha's feet appear to stand on mountain-caves," and asked "Is any special scene suggested?,63 I want to propose that the Buddha is being represented as leaving his footprint on a mountain top, much as he did on Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka. If this identification is correct, we have more support for the theory that the Burma/East India area is the likely source for the ideas that led to the Sukhothai walking Buddha. VI. Why, finally, might the walking images and the footprint cult have been adopted? The answer must lie in the political and religious history of Sukhothai, about which we know much as 61 See note 40 above. Compare Carol Stratton and Miriam McNair Scott, The Art of Sukhothai: Thailand's Golden Age from the Mid-Thirteenth to the Mid-Fifteenth Centuries (Kuala Lampur: Oxford University Press, 1981): 69, who state that "The Sukhothai walking Buddha may have evolved from the depiction of the story 'Descent from Tavatimsa Heaven.'" 62 J. E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, "The 'Stone Buddha' of Chiengmai and its Inscription," Artibus Asiae Felicitation Volume Presented to Professor George Coedes on the Occasion of His Seventy-Fifth Birthday 24, 3/4 (1961): 324-329. 63 Luce, Old Burma-Early Pagan, vol. two, p. 142. 103</page><page sequence="32">compared to such earlier periods as Dvaravati, but even that is too scanty to propose anything but rather broad historical outlines, which are themselves highly speculative. We can say that the decision to make and stress the walking Buddha must not have been passive. Considering Sukhothai society and the icon's innovative nature, it must have been made by one person or a small group of people. At Sukhothai this would have been either the king or the leaders of the clergy. Griswold and Prasert, the two scholars who know Sukhothai best, consistently present the king as the decision maker for most major events at Sukhothai. In this light, we can point out that the nature of Sukhothai kingship was indeed in concert with the character of the walking Buddha. The Thai king was not regarded as a god among men.64 He interacted with his subjects in an amazingly familiar fashion. Ram Kamheng wrote in his inscription, for example, that there was a bell at his palace gate that any commoner with a grievance could ring that would bring the king himself personally to decide the matter.65 He appears, in fact, to have moved quite freely among his subjects. At the end of the rainy season he and his subjects presented gifts (the kathin ceremony) to monks at a monastery outside the city, and then walked back to the city.66 The reluctance of the Indian and Indianized Southeast Asian rulers, by analogy to the gods, to touch the ground appears not to have been shared by the Sukhothai kings.67 Ram Kamheng's inscription also tells us that he worshipped a spirit of a mountain.68 This god was of the greatest importance as the safety of the entire kingdom relied on its proper supplica- tion. There were other spirits of other mountains.69 Was the appeal of placing footprints of the Buddha on the hills surrounding Sukhothai an attempt to put a Buddhist face or stamp (literally) of approval on this pre-Buddhist spirit-worship? Or could the footprint worship have been promulgated by the Buddhist clergy as a way to usurp the worship of the mountain and its guardian? 64 Griswold and Prasert, "On kingship and society at Sukhodaya," in G. William Skinner and A. Thomas Kirsch, eds. Change and Persistence in Thai Society: Essays in Honor of Lauriston Sharp (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, I975): 45. 65 Griswold and Prasert, "The Inscription of King Rama Gamhenfi of Sukhodaya (1292 A.D.)," p. 208. 66 "When they are ready to return to the city they walk together, forming a line all the way from the Arafnifika to the parade- ground" [Griswold and Prasert, "The Inscription of King Rama Gamhnfi of Sukhodaya (i292 A. D.),"p. 210o]. I think it is important to realize that the inscription says the celebrants "walked" back to the city. The verb used is "dau" [Ibid., p. 199, line 18], which in modern Thai is the noun "thaaw" meaning "foot". Yoneo Ishii's inscriptional index glosses "dau" as "walk" [Yoneo Ishii, Osamuy Akagi, and Noriko Endo, A Glossarial Index of the Sukhothai Inscription. The Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University, Discussion Paper No. 53 (November 1972): 74]. This translation is in contrast with that of George Coedes, for example, who uses "s'avancer": "quand on s'en revient a la cite, le cort"ge se forme dis ce monastere des Arafifikas et s'avance jusqu'-a l'orie de la plaine": [Recueil des inscriptions du Siam: premiere partie: inscriptions de Sukhodaya (Bangkok: Bangkok Times Press, 1924): 46]. 67 In "On kingship and Society at Sukhodaya," Griswold and Prasert present a picture of Sukhothai kings as paternal and humane, particularly in contrast to the tyrannical and divine Cambodian rulers. The authors' argument relies to a great extent on comparing the concept of Thai kingship as seen in Ram Kamheng's inscription to that as seen in the memoirs of Chou Ta-kuan, the Chinese ambassador at Angkor in I296. I will allow Griswold's and Prasert's article to argue the evidence, but for our purposes there is a clear distinction that emerges between the Cambodian and Thai kings' modes and objectives of travel. Contrast the movement of King Ram Kamheng as just presented in the text to that of the contemporaneous Cambodian king who only infrequently left the palace (four or five times during the year Chou Ta- kuan was in residence), and then usually with a huge entourage among whom the king rode, standing on an elephant whose tusks were sheathed in gold and holding the royal sword. When he passed, the people on the road had to prostrate themselves with their foreheads on the ground. [See Paul Pelliot, Memoires sur les coutumes du Cambodge de Tcheou Ta- Kouan (Paris: Adrien-Maisonneuve, 1951): 34-35.] 68 Griswold and Prasert, "The Inscription of King Rama Gamhefi of Sukhodaya (1292 A.D.)", p. 214. 69 Griswold and Prasert, "The Pact Between Sukhodaya and Nan,"Journal of the Siam Society 57, part I (January I969):83. 1o4</page><page sequence="33">What, in fact, was the decision-making role of the clergy at Sukhothai? Elizabeth Gosling, in a very interesting recent dissertation, has suggested that Griswold and others have underestimated the clergy's importance.7" Her work is part of a current general reassessment of the relations between the church and the king in Theravadin Buddhist societies, with the clergy frequently being given a more significant role.71 At Sukhothai, the clergy's importance is not at all hidden, at least if the evidence of the inscriptions and chronicles is taken at face value. Inscription No. 2, for example, is a long paean to a monk named Si Satha. This inscription was probably written by Si Satha himself and may date to around 1345 when the reconstruction of the Mahadhatu, the most important temple at Sukhothai, was commemorated. The inscription presents Si Satha as a future Buddha and, in regard to the issues at hand, as a major builder of monuments in Sukhothai and even in Sri Lanka.72 One of Si Satha's likely additions at Wat Mahadhatu is the frieze of walking monks around the base (fig. 20).73 The walking pose was thus used for monks as well as Buddhas. The conception of monks circumambulating the stupa in worship is indeed an appropriate concept; but giving monks such visibility is not found on other Sukhothai monu- ments and is likely to be due to Si Satha's personal aggrandizement. A context for understanding Si Satha as a walking monk is given in his inscription. At one point Satha, after others' requests had failed, asked a group of recalcitrant relics to return to the Mah-dh-tu chaitya. They were out of the chaitya, flying in the air, and they acquiesced to his request by returning to the stupa in a great display of light and movement. The observers at the scene prostrated themselves before Satha for this miracle, saying "[he] is really a future Buddha, isn't he?"74 The inscription continues that "Wherever... [he] stepped, they dug up the earth at that place as soon as he raised his foot: they dug it up as being worthy to take home and worship."75 The connection among walking, footprints, and their worship is here graphically indicated. Furthermore, that Si Satha saw this walking and footprint imagery as relating to himself, and by extension to the monkhood, supports the supposition that the clergy played a role in its adoption and use. In conclusion, while the answer to the questions of how and why the walking Buddha was initially invented may never be precisely answered, we have been able to trace and explain several of its characteristics. We found that there existed sources for the conception of the walking Buddha, the evidence pointing probably to twelfth and thirteenth century Burma and Eastern India. There was at Sukhothai a clear connection between the walking Buddha and the cult of the Footprints. This association appears to explain the single, iconic Buddha images better than a 70 Elizabeth Montgomery Blair Gosling, "The History of Sukhothai as a Ceremonial Center: A Study of Early Siamese Architecture and Society," Ph.D. dissertation, The University of Michigan (1983): 296-312. 71 I am thinking here particularly of studies by Michael AungThwin on Burmese history, for example, his "Kingship, the Sahigha and Society in Pagan," Kenneth R. Hall and John K. Whitmore, eds., Explorations in Early Southeast Asian History: The Origins of Southeast Asian Statecraft, Michigan Papers on South and Southeast Asia, no. ii (Ann Arbor, 1976): 205-256. 72 Griswold and Prasert, "King L6daiya of Sukhodaya and His Contemporaries," pp. 75- 144. Griswold and Prasert leave open the question of the inscription's author, presenting arguments for both Si Satha and King L6daiya (pp. 88-90). 73 Gosling suggests Si Satha was responsible for the reconstruction of the Mahathat, including the replacement of the stone J~taka engravings of the base with the stucco walking monks ("The History of Sukhothai as a Ceremonial Center," pp. 304-306). Griswold's discussion places the renovation in the hands of King L6daiya (Towards a History of Sukhodaya Art, pp. 18-23). 74 Griswold and Prasert, "King L6daiya of Sukhodaya and His Contemporaries," p. 132. 75 Ibid. 105</page><page sequence="34">derivation from narrative scenes. Probably both the kings and the clergy were users of the imagery of the walking Buddha. At least the inscriptions allow us some information about which to speculate on their relation to the images. The ways in which the Thai walking Buddhas were innovative are brought into relief by the discussion in the first part of the paper of the walking Buddha's almost total absence in Indian art. This absence is an issue in itself because of the importance walking has for the Buddha and for many of his life scenes. It was not that walking was ignored by Indian artists; there was even an early aniconic form of the walking Buddha. But the adoption of the standing posture and sometimes conventions to suggest walking, rather than a simple walking posture, appears deliberate. Furthermore, the very existence of the Thai walking Buddhas would itself necessitate some explanation for their absence in Indian art. My suggested explanation of the resistance to depicting the Buddha in an unequivocal walking stance is that, as a god, the Buddha should maintain a separation from the earth. Thus in the numerous walking narrative scenes, the Indian artist used a standing figure of the Buddha in order to maintain the appearance of an unmoving, iconic image, as the walking posture would too explicitly indicate contact with the earth in a completely human manner. In short, walking would degrade the Buddha and be out of character with his royal and godly nature. Postcript Since completing this manuscript, two important artistic discoveries made in Thailand have been published that pertain to the issues raised in my essay. The first is a pair of huge footprints (each print about 1.30 m. wide by 3-50 m. long) which was excavated at Sa Morakot in Prachinburi Province in Thailand in February of 1986. Up until this time the earliest Southeast Asian examples of the Buddha's footprints were, as noted in my essay, from Pagan in Burma which date to the IIth century (at the earliest). The Sa Morakot footprints were uncovered in an excavation of a structure that revealed two building periods. The footprints, apparently carved in the stone floor of the earlier structure, are of the Dviravati period (ca. seventh-tenth centuries A.D.), although it is difficult from the information thus far published to be more precise. The significance of the discovery is also difficult to assess, as one must ask why no other Dviravati period footprints have been found among the extensive remains of this period. Nevertheless, for our purposes what is important is that footprints do not appear again in Thailand until the Sukhothai period, in other words at about the same time as the walking Buddha images (say thirteenth-fourteenth centuries), and their association with the walking imagery is not brought into doubt due to the Dviravati discovery. [The footprints are illustrated and discussed by several scholars in a series of articles in Muang Boran Journal i2, no. 3 (July-September I986). The articles are in Thai with English summaries. Most scholars in the Muang Boran Journal articles say that the earlier Dviravati period structure is of brick with a laterite floor, in which the footprints are carved. Only No Na Paknam in his states - explicitly in the English summary (p. 44) and ambiguously in the Thai (p. 39)- that the footprints are carved in brick.] 0o6</page><page sequence="35">The second discovery is eight repouss6 Buddha images, three of which are walking, on the Phra Maha That stupa at Wat Phra That Hariphunchai in Lamphun in Northern Thailand. In addition, four of the images have inscriptions. First brought to the attention of the scholarly community in 1981 by Hans Penth, these eight images and their inscriptions have become recently the focus of considerable debate. For our topic, it is Piriya Krairiksh's suggestion that the images date to ca. 1330 that is of importance, as in his opinion they are earlier than any walking images at Sukhothai, and in fact are the source for the Sukhothai images. The debate is at this point quite confusing, as it involves issues of epigraphy and Thai linguistics, as well as art history, and strong opposing opinions have been voiced; specifically, many scholars feel the images and inscriptions must be dated later. Nevertheless, whether Krairiksh is correct or not does not affect the arguments I am making in this paper. I am not attempting to identify the first Thai images of the walking Buddha, an objective that is, in my opinion, impossible given the scant extant examples. Furthermore, even if the Lamphun images are earlier than any extant Sukhotai examples, this in no way argues that there were no earlier Sukhothai examples. Ultimately, whether the relief walking Buddha with one heel raised was invented in the Lamphun or Sukhothai area, or indeed somewhere else in Thailand, does not change its sources, uses, and associations that are the topic of my discussion.
