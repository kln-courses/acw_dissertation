The address "To lordbyron in the W?derness" introducing Blake's last pub lished iUuminated work (1822), has troubled the scant number of critics who wish to estabUsh explicitly the connection between the two poets.1 The relevance of The Ghost of Abel to Byron's Cain: A Mystery was significantly clarified by Leslie Tannenbaum.2 Previous to Tannenbaume seminal work, most critics, while noting sim?arities between Byron and Blake, perceived Blake's response as a corrective to Byron's flawed vision of the nature of God and the concept of atonement.3 Tannenbaum argues not so much with these conclusions as he does with the method by which they are reached, noting particularly the critics' concentrating on theologi cal or inteUectual issues at the expense of Blake's critical method (Tannen baum 350, n. 3). The strength of Tannenbaum's work resides in his insistence that we consider how Blake's aUusions to and readings of bibUcal texts frame his response to Byron; he takes seriously both Blake's reference to Elijah, framed clearly by his question, "What doest thou here, Elijah?" and Blake's reading of the PauUne Epistles to the Hebrews.

Moving deftly among the three biblical texts, Tannenbaum argues that the "opposition of the blood of Abel and the blood of Christ is the basis of Blake's dramatic treatment . . . and the Epistle to the Hebrews focuses on images and issues that inform the Cain and Abel story as Byron interprets it, as well as the Elijah story that Blake alludes to in his invocation" (Tannenbaum 361). By associating Byron with Elijah, Blake acknowledged Byron as a true poet-prophet; however, Tannenbaum also believes that Blake chides Byron, who, in the process of exposing the false prophets, weakened his own faith and thus failed to experience an equiva lent of Elijah's theophany. Blake, according to Tannenbaum, recognizes the limitations imposed by Byron's skepticism and confirms in The Ghost of Abel the reality of atonement that Byron could not validate. Tannenbaum successfully foregrounds the biblical contexts of Blake's reading of Byron. However, despite his painstaking attendance to the Epistle to the Hebrews' consequence to The Ghost of Abel, Tannenbaum neglects to render a close reading of Elijah's story that would more thor oughly inform Blake's appeal to Byron in the name of the prophet. A more detailed reading of Elijah's story amends Tannenbaume reading of Blake's response to Byron with respect to these issues. Conscientious study of Elijah's story suggests that Byron's shortcomings do not reflect a failure to achieve the standard of prophecy set by Elijah. Instead, it demonstrates that in Blake's view Byron is the nineteenth-century Elijah, and Byron's limi tations within his cultural and spiritual context parallel Elijah's more closely than even Tannenbaum asserts. These liabilities are not to be read as a failure of the prophet or the prophetic, but as exemplary of how each prophet functions as an essential link in the genealogical chain of prophets within biblical tradition. Elijah's story conveys three major concerns that pervade Blake's work: the parameters of prophetic speaking/writing, the function of individual prophets within prophetic genealogy, and the function of prophecy itself. Relative to these concerns, Blake saw in Byron's rendering of the Cain story similarities between the two poets which belied their differences. For Blake, the Bible was a text, like any other text, upon which exegetes enforced any number of critical apparatuses to support an equally diverse number of theological doctrines, even when those doctrines contradicted each other. These exegetes toiled under the Augustinian assumption that the Bible was the origin of prophetic truth. Since there could only be one truth, exegetes battled over which of their truths would take precedence. The interpretive chaos that ensued diminished the Bible's ability to function as a guide to spiritual well-being. Under higher criticism's influence, Blake shifted the locus of metaphysical revelation: to read the</page><page sequence="3">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 617 Bible spirituaUy assumed that the receiver or reader determined the Bible's message. Whether or not that message coincided with traditional interpre tations was inconsequential. In this sense, both Byron and Blake anticipate Vincent Descombe's comment that transforming our interpretive strategies relative to the Bible aUows the text to speak to us rather than to a past, dead audience.4 Both Byron and Blake realized that by examining the Bible Uterarily rather than literaUy, new unities?hitherto unsought or unno ticed?could be found to reestablish the preeminence of the biblical word in terms that spoke to their age rather than to previous ones. Byron's Cain comprises a Uterary delineation of his "literal" reading of Genesis 4, a reading which erases the doctrinal glosses of this text, returning it to the concrete realm of individual human experience and action. Blake's naming of Byron as prophet acknowledges the "diaboUc," prophetic nature of Byron's play at the same time that his rewriting of certain of its aspects intimates that he understood his relationship to other literary prophets within the visionary Uneage. Blake determines prophecy not by the potential of the New Testament to recontextualize the Old Testament but on its relevance when read symboUcaUy. Those texts which can be read symboUcaUy form a multi-vo cal, "diabolic" Bible which resists traditional conceptions of biblical exe gesis. Blake recognizes that texts which do not speak to aU people of aU ages cannot possibly be sacred. The symbolic text?for example, 1 Kings? is sacred because its message survives the transmission process. A text such as Numbers, however?a non-symboUc code of laws specific to a particular time, race, and period of reUgious development?cannot survive as sacred. In other words, for Blake, a sacred, prophetic text must have a meaning that can be transmitted through aU ages. If the text does not meet this symboUc criterion, We are thus perfectly entitled to refuse all readings that offer no receivable meaning for us, but have a meaning only for the ancients, for the first receivers. So between ourselves and what is to be inter preted there is necessarily this very particular relation in which we know, before any interpretation, that we alone are being addressed. (Descombes 25) Blake's recognition that not aU signs are sacred is clearly indicated in his adoption of Swedenborg's list of biblical books which could be read symboUcaUy or spirituaUy. These books are confirmed within Blake's writ ing when he renders Christ the authority for choosing sacred texts in Jerusalem: 4- Vincent Descombes, Objects of All Sorts (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins UP, 1986) 24.</page><page sequence="4">618 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER surrounded with a Cloud . . . builded with immortal labour, of gold &amp; jewels, a sublime Ornament, a Couch of repose with Sixteen pillars, canopied with emblems &amp; written verse, Spiritual Verse, order'd &amp; measur'd: from when time shall reveal the Five books of the Deca logue: the books of Joshua &amp; Judges, Samuel, a double book, &amp; Kings, a double book, the Psalm &amp; Prophets, the Four-fold Gospel, and the Revelations everlasting. Eternity groan'd &amp; was troubled at the image of Eternal Death! (48: 4-12) Blake considered 1 and 2 Kings inspired texts, open to symbolic or spiritual reading. "Inspiration" for Blake connotes the writer's ability to produce the effect of authenticity by adopting the position (name, stance, strategy) of the "Author."5 Writing in the name of God is the same as writing in the name of Moses; they are equally "inspired." The "inspired" text creates the conditions by which it will obtain the same power over its readers as a text which has been produced by an "authority." The poet's inspiration inheres in his ability to produce the "truth" of another's voice as a self-originated truth. This is why Blake can say in his Annotations of Watson that If Moses did not write the history of his acts, it takes away the authority altogether; it ceases to be history &amp; becomes a Poem of probable impossibilities, fabricated for pleasure, as moderns say, but I say by Inspiration . . . (616) By inscribing Byron with the name "Elijah," Blake marks Byron as prophet and his text as "inspired." Simultaneously, Blake confers upon Byron's text the power of divine authority. It is God who questions Elijah in 1 Kings, and it is through God's voice that Blake questions Byron. In other words, Blake takes John's opening lines from his Gospel, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1) and dis-figures their temporal, spatial parameters. For Blake, the Word is with God, and when the prophet/poet recognizes this "present and presence," his relationship to the word is no longer temporally and spatially (and therefore spiritually) belated. Blake's rhetorical force makes of seemingly disparate voices a sacred univocality, an ongoing articulation of the Word through a redoubling of names and texts which derives from and makes possible continual restructurings of meaning. The prophet's voice contributes to the multivocality of the prophetic 5. I remain "inspired" by Blake's inspiration as I discussed it a number of years ago with Molly Rothenberg, whose work strongly influences my reading. Of particular note is her thorough, provocative discussion of this topic in Rethinking Blake's Textuality (Columbia: U of Missouri P, 1993) 9-27.</page><page sequence="5">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 619 text. No prophet can present the whole truth of divine prophecy; pretend ing to do so invites calamity. As a result of this beUef, Blake resists the traditional conception of Moses as the greatest prophet, and instead con siders EUjah to be the ideal prophet. Elijah, who for Blake "comprehends aU prophetic Characters," spoke directly with God and was assumed into heaven without dying?supposedly so that he would be able to return to herald the Messiah's birth. In the Transfiguration, Elijah's place is opposite Moses (representing the Law), from whom he is separated by Christ. Blake's renditions of Moses?despite his belief that Moses was a great prophet?suggest that the poet viewed him as comprehending neither what he chronicled, nor, by extension, the limitations of his position within these events. Thus, Blake envisions Moses in his Ulustration of the Burning Bush as attentive to his people but negUgent of his prophecy, epitomized by the scroU apparently discarded at his feet.6 In Blake's iUustration of the Ten Commandments, Moses is stooped and unseeing as God writes the Deca logue (Keynes, plate 46). This depiction further accentuates Blake's adverse reception of Moses, whom he views as more lawmaker than prophet. Moses' desire to regulate the behavior of the Jews through the law resulted in a systemic annihilating of a conception of God as loving and absolving: The laws of the Jews were (both ceremonial &amp; real) the basest &amp; most oppressive of human codes, &amp; being like aU other codes given under pretence of divine command were what Christ pronounced them, The Abomination that makest desolate, i.e., State Religion, which is the source of aU Cruelty. (618) Blake's commentary is particularly notable in the context of Byron's Cain, since Byron portrays Cain as a victim of a repressive "state" reUgion whose laws were estabUshed, interpreted, and enforced by Adam and Abel. Cain's initial innocence, prior to his corruption and repression by the law, is exempUfied in Blake's painting, Mediations Among the Tombs, where both Abel and Cain flee from the attacking serpent.7 In his capacity as lawgiver, Moses is affiUated with Cain in the prose Vision of the Last Judgment; as Blake describes him, Moses appears "on the left, beneath the faUing figure of Cain . . . casting his table of stone into the deeps. It ought to be understood that the Persons, Moses &amp; Abraham, are not here meant, but the States Signified by those Names" (556). In a temporal inversion, Blake aUows Moses, as a representation of the law, to precede Cain into heU, suggesting that Moses' written tablets merely fulfiUed the oraUy transmitted 6.

If Cain is damned, it is quite literally and visually because he follows the path and is a victim of institutionalized repression. And as Blake transforms the individual significance of Cain and Moses into representations of oppressive religious institutions and political states, he succeeds also in transmigrating the burden of responsibility for murder from the individual to these institutions, since "God never makes one man murder another, nor one nation" and to him "who believe[d] the Bible &amp; profess [ed] [himself] a Christian, a defence of the Wickedness of the Israelites in murdering so many thousands under pretence of a command from God is altogether Abominable &amp; Blasphemous" (Annota tions to Watson 614). The connection between Cain and Moses generates out of what they make possible rather than what either of them did as individuals; both bring violence and murder into the world, but both also bring good. But, more so, Cain is entangled in the mesh of the warring forces of good and evil whose disunity was engendered by the Fall. For this reason, even though Blake doesn't absolve Cain completely for the murder, the onus is on the state. In light of this redistribution of responsibility, it comes as no surprise that Blake believes Cain's mark was a sign of divine forgiveness and love. Blake further "cleanses" Cain's role in the first murder by emphasizing his importance as a progenitor of Jesus through the Maternal Line of "The Daughters of Vala, Mother of the Body of death," which begins with Caina, Blake's name for Cain's sister/wife (Jerusalem 62: 8-13). Blake gives the impression that he held Adam and Eve more responsible for Abel's murder than Cain, since they initially divided good from evil when they sinned. In fact, The Ghost of Abel concerns primarily their response to Abel's death as Byron portrays it in Cain: A Mystery. Blake uses his play as a means of offering Byron his rewriting, not of Cain's action, but of Adam and Eve's response to the murder. This response is based on a redefinition of God's nature. As such, The Ghost of Abel is not so much a corrective to Byron's play as an acknowledgment of how Adam and Eve's figuration of a vengeful God in Cain: A Mystery necessarily leads to their reaction. By rewriting their response, Blake restructures the theological foundation of Adam and Eve's reaction by converting Elohim into Jehovah, the God that Cain experiences at the conclusion of Byron's play. Whereas Byron exposes the harsh reality of error and judgment under the dark cloud of a vengeful God, Blake seeks to erase the narrative, cultural reality of this God in order to make the belief in salvation a possibility. Blake's purpose, then, might be to offer the conditions under which we can believe in atonement as a means of subverting the religious institutional doctrines under which atonement is made impossible. The story of Abel's murder is relegated to the text's illustration, so Cain does not participate in the play's</page><page sequence="7">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 621 dialogue. Blake ends the drama by Ulustrating Cain desperately grieving over his dead brother's body. Combined with his portrayal of Cain in Mediations Among the Tombs, we begin to understand why Blake read Cain's impulsive crime sympatheticaUy; Blake perceives him as a figure of hope and salvation rather than as a figure of unmitigated evU. In contrast to Moses, Elijah abhored violence and was not a lawmaker; Blake also would have been attracted to the historical moment in which EUjah lived and practiced his prophecy, given primarily in i Kings. Most of Elijah's story can be attributed to the first Deuteronomist, who judged every king on the basis of reUgious loyalty, with David, the poet/king, as the standard. Against this model, the Deuteronomist teUs the story of EUjah's battle with Jezebel, who represents state religion at its worst. Jezebel's religious tyranny and her subsequent faU demonstrate the Deu teronomist's theme that national success depends on aUegiance to the national God (Yahweh). Worship of Baal, which took place in the forbid den or "high places" outside of Jerusalem, constituted idolatry. Every monarch of the northern kingdom faUed to check this idolatry; conse quently, that kingdom feU by means of God's judgment, carried out by the Assyrians. The first Deuteronomist's theme suited Blake's designs exactly, since it intertwined effectively with Blake's concerns about England's (Albion's) condition: the church's politicization and the government's corruption. EUjah was considered an outlaw or criminal of the state by Ahab and his queen Jezebel, for he was the only prophet to chaUenge Jezebel and Baal's dominion. This confrontation is the context for the line Blake quotes from i Kings. Certainly, we begin to see already why Blake associates EUjah with Byron, who, through his character Cain, chaUenged Jehovah, the equivalent of the god Baal in Byron's play. Blake would have associated the priests with the majority of his and Byron's contemporaries, who viewed Byron's play, as Tannenbaum notes, "as part of the upsurge of radical pubUcations that arose in defiance of increasing governmental as saults against 'blasphemy' and 'sedition'" (352). The pejorative reaction to Byron's play is not that different from Jezebel's response to Elijah's act. Both suffered exiles of sorts: Byron's Uterary popularity was effectively crushed in the play's critical aftermath, although he continued to write, and EUjah opted for early retirement, a point to which we w?l return later. Elijah's function within the Bible emerges when we consider how the Unguistic operation of his name affirms his poUtical/spiritual position. The name EUjah, which means "Yah [short form of Yahweh] is Lord," puts into operation a complicated chiasmas between the subject and object of discourse. Elijah, as subject and as prophet, speaks in the name of the Lord in order to confirm the Lord's presence. To say, "I am Elijah" is to say,</page><page sequence="8">622 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER "I am Yahweh is Lord," or "I am equal to, or the equivalent of, Yah weh is Lord"; or even to say, "I am to the extent that Yahweh is Lord." For Elijah to identify himself, then, is the same as confirming the existence of God, as if His actuality were guaranteed through the prophet's existence. To call on the name of the prophet, to identify that there is such a thing as a prophet, is to confirm God's being. God's authority is confirmed neither through the voice of God nor through His works, but through the speech act that proclaims "Elijah," that proclaims, as Blake attests, "Man is All Imagination. God is Man &amp; exists in us &amp; we in Him" (Annotations to Berkeley's Siris 664). At the same time, calling out the name "Elijah" defers God's voice; the name becomes a negative response, an affirmation of neither presence nor absence. Elijah affirms the presence of the Lord, somewhere between the first and third person of discourse, not in the second person "you," but in the territory created between the two statements, "I Am" and "the Lord is God." Elijah makes present that which can never be present; he reveals God in His absence. The strength of the prophet lies in his ability to communicate through his own voice and being that which can never be present. The importance of the individual voice in determining the nature and impact of the prophet is clearly visible in Elijah's challenge to Baal, one of the most scathing institutional attacks in the Bible, a fact that Blake would have greatly appreciated. When the priests of Baal are not answered by their God, Elijah says, "Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked" (1 Kings 18:27). When Elijah prays to the Lord to consume the water-soaked altar with fire, the prayer constitutes a request for confir mation not only of Lord as God, but also of Elijah as prophet: . . . Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. (1 Kings 18:36-37) After the sacrifice is consumed with fire, along with the priests of Baal, the people respond by saying, "The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God," which confirms not only the existence of Yahweh, but also the authority of the name "Elijah." The two disparate voices, God's and the prophet's, become a unity that is validated by the people who interpret the sacrifice. They are translations of each other, God and Elijah; they speak and corroborate each other's authority. In Byron's Cain, the Jehovah of Adam and his family is the equivalent of Jezebel's Baal, who, from Elijah's standpoint, is a violent, fictional,</page><page sequence="9">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 623 narrative god. Elijah chaUenges the people of Israel to choose between Baal, the sky god who supposedly controUed the rain, and Yahweh. The choice, which has been interpreted traditionaUy as one between Ufe and death since the people are suffering from drought, is not merely reUgious but political as weU. The two altars reveal the split that has occurred in the social configuration as a result of Jezebel's marriage to Ahab; her introduction of Baal into the community serves as a barrier between the people and their god, and the people and their king. Baal, like Adam's Jehovah, becomes an interpolation of God; both are presented as vicious deities who demand complete obedience and who rule by instiUing fear in the populace. After Elijah brings about the faU of Baal's prophets, Jezebel swears that she w?l execute him. EUjah, afraid for his life, flees into the w?derness and eventuaUy arrives at Horeb, the place where the Lord revealed the Law to Moses. It is the Lord's address to EUjah at this time that Blake borrowed in order to address Byron at the beginning of The Ghost of Abel. The story of Elijah's encounter with God can be divided into two major components, each of which is further subdivided into God's interrogation, EUjah's response, and God's reaction. The first part reads as foUows: And he came thither to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, EUjah? And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the ch?dren of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my Ufe, to take it away." And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still smaU voice. And it was so, when EUjah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave, (i Kings 19:9-13) The initial verses of this passage provide us with evidence of EUjah's state of mind that contradict his ear?er-stated condition. After fleeing from Jezebel into the w?derness, Elijah "requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my Ufe; for I am not better than my fathers" (1 Kings 19:4). Here, EUjah is w?ling that the Lord take his Ufe because he is frustrated that he was not able to overcome Jezebel's tyranny. What Elijah questions is his position and function as prophet. To be less than his fathers signifies a fa?ure on Elijah's part in the genealogy</page><page sequence="10">624 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER of the prophets, an inability to move forward in the prophetic chain. However, the Lord's angel sustains him for the journey to Horeb, where, as the above passage indicates, what was initially the fear of prophetic failure becomes translated into his fear that he will die at the hands of infidels. The later passage relocates Elijah's fear of prophetic failure to fear of mortality and shame for this mortal trepidation. Elijah's anxiety for his life is understandable for readers, even coming after God destroys a veritable army of Baal's priests; and, while God may be somewhat impatient with Elijah, He certainly doesn't chastise his errant prophet. Instead, God seeks to convince Elijah of His might not through words but through example, an old and well-established deific strategy in the Old Testament. Because Elijah's fear is so great, the Lord pulls out the "heavy artillery," as it were, demonstrating His power in a manner that reflects a singular intimacy rarely evinced in the chronicles of the relation ships between God and his prophets. God "passes by" Elijah, similar to the manner in which He passed before Moses, here with the seeming intention of proving to Elijah His omnipotence, so that Elijah will no longer be fearful. The Lord wishes to demonstrate to Elijah the side of Himself which creates and sustains life rather than the side which is capable of taking it away. After Elijah witnesses God's geographical alterations from inside the cave, he hears, as a trace or remainder, a "still small voice." Tannenbaum indicates that "Elijah received a theophany that revealed the voice of the Lord to be in the 'still small voice' (i Kings 19:12) that transcends the blustering of the nature god that the pagans worship under the name of Baal" (Tannenbaum 351). However, neither the text nor the events that follow support this interpretation. Upon hearing this voice, Elijah covers his face with his mande and then stands at the entrance to the cave. Elijah's position is liminal, between the internal place of vision and the external, mutable world; between his fealty to God the Eternal and his fear of death. This liminality is accentuated by the striking change that occurs in the origination of the question's repetition. The first Deuteronomist excludes the phrase "and the Lord said" from the text and replaces it with "and there came a voice." The voice that redirects the question is merely that, a "voice"; in the slippage of signifieds the Deuteronomist signals a modification in the discursive structure of the question and destabilizes the foundation upon which the interpretation of God's actions takes place. "The still small voice" mediates between the "proper" voice of the Lord and the "common" voice which reintroduces the question. How are we to interpret the positioning and significance of "the still small voice"? We might begin by construing the "still small voice" as the mediating factor between God's "rewriting of the landscape" and Elijah's</page><page sequence="11">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 625 "reading" of it, and, by extension, between the Bible and Byron's rereading of it, and between Byron's writing of Cain and Blake's rereading and rewriting of it. The "stiU smaU voice," in its displacing and deferring function, can be Ukened to written meaning (God's rewriting of the landscape) that, as Jacques Derrida suggests, presents itself as prerequisitely and simultaneously read: and does not meaning present itself as such at the point at which the other is found, the other who maintains both the vigU and the back-and-forth mo tion, the work, that comes between writing and reading, making this work irreducible? Meaning is neither before nor after the act. Is not that which is caUed God, that which imprints every human course and recourse with its secondarity, the passageway of deferred reciproc ity between reading and writing? Or the absolute witness to the dialogue in which what one sets out to write has already been read, and what one sets out to say is already a response, the third party as the transparency of meaning? Simultaneously part of creation and the father of Logos. The circularity and traditionality of Logos. The strange labor of conversion and adventure in which grace can only be that which is missing.8 The "stiU smaU voice" is much like the "deferred reciprocity" between writing and reading to which Derrida refers. If God is the passageway of deferred reciprocity, He is, in this context, the means by which interpre tation takes place; the "stiU smaU voice" is the conversion factor which aUows for the active movement between God's writing and EUjah's read ing. Thus, the voice which speaks to EUjah is neither God's nor his own, but an actively engaged "other" that maintains the work of reading and writing that makes neither one reducible to the other. When Blake's critics have discussed The Ghost of Abel, they have concentrated particularly on this biblical passage, assuming that Blake uses the quotation to chide Byron for his play's unremitting, nihiUstic conclusion wh?e at the same time recognizing Byron's prophetic genius.9 However, they seem to have fa?ed to read the event to its conclusion; otherwise, they would have reaUzed that the question which Blake addresses to Byron occurs twice in the bibUcal text. When God first puts the question to EUjah, EUjah responds by indicating that he is afraid for his life. In order to demonstrate his might and instiU trust in Elijah, God "passes by" EUjah, reconstructing the geography in 8. Jacques Derrida, Writing and Difference (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1978) 11. 9.

Elijah covers his face with his mantle and guiltily withdraws. The mantle, like a text, is the agency of prophecy and the mark of fear and shame. At this point in the biblical story, something very crucial occurs: the question, "What doest thou here, Elijah?" is posited again. Instead of what we might expect?Elijah's admission of shame for being afraid of Jezebel in the face of God's might?we discover that Elijah's fear has not been alleviated by God's tremendous display of power; in fact, Elijah responds in exactly the same fashion: And behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria: and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him. (i Kings 19:13?16) Elijah's unaltered response to God's demonstration illustrates how for the prophet, as for Byron's Cain, mortality is an irreducible, unavoidable given of existence; to die in God's service is still to die. God's rhetorical strategy, by which he left to Elijah the responsibility to interpret His actions through His powerful display, fails to elicit the response that we, and God, might expect. God fails to establish an authority through this rhetorical strategy that convinces Elijah to relinquish the authority by which he initially responded to God's question. This authority is Elijah's knowledge of the seemingly incontrovertible certainty of his death. Thus, the means by which Elijah interprets and reacts to God's actions complicates our reading of the text in a way which illuminates further Blake's response to Byron. What we see in Elijah is a limitation, but while he cannot overcome his fear of death, he is not penalized for this lack. The text proceeds without presenting any chastisement by God concerning Elijah's reluctance to continue as prophet. Instead, God gives Elijah three directives, the third of which is the anointing of his successor, Elisha. That God still favors Elijah is indicated through these directives, the first of which relieves Elijah of his prophetic duties. The second two directives are aimed at removing the enemies of God and Israel who threaten to kill Elijah.</page><page sequence="13">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 627 Elijah's response to these directives is curious, because he does not foUow them precisely. After returning to Damascus, Elijah moves to the third directive, ignoring the first two, and seeks out EUsha. He does not anoint (consecrate, sanctify, mark) him through the established sanctification pro cedure that gives an individual over to God. Instead, Elijah "passed by him and cast his mantle upon him." The aUusion to God's "passing" in front of Elijah is noteworthy, since Elijah replicates God's action when he "passes by" Elisha in the place of God to transfer his prophetic powers. EUjah passes before EUsha, who is plowing the fields in a symboUc inversion of God's "plowing" of the terrain, and leaves behind a trace not dissimilar to the "stiU small voice." The mantle with which EUjah concealed himself when he heard the "stiU smaU voice" becomes the sign of Elisha's succession as prophet. EUsha thus becomes marked as EUjah's successor by inheriting the mantle, a synecdoche of mortality and shame. It is this cloak of conceal ment, mutab?ity, and mortification which empowers EUsha as prophet. The mantle symboUzes, then, the ultimate separation between man and god: mortality, and the distance between the first and third persons, between the "I" of immediate being and the "he" of distance and absence. EUjah's mantle conceals his mortaUty from God in a manner sim?ar to how God conceals His presence from man; the mantle delimits Elijah's power just as God's reorganization of the landscape delimits His. Neither God nor EUjah discloses himself fuUy; it is as if man and God can only speak "back to back," as it were. The significance of the mantle, particularly as it regards the relationship between Blake and Byron, reveals itself more completely at the beginning of 2 Kings, when Elijah is about to be assumed into heaven by a whirlwind. EUjah, once again in possession of his mantle, roUs it up and strikes the river Jordan's waters, causing them to separate and aUowing EUjah and EUsha to cross over. The mantle, analogous to Blake's "golden string" which the reader roUs up to enter Heaven's Gate in Jerusalem's waUs (Jerusalem 77: 1), enables Elijah to pass through "heaven's gate," or the river's waters, in order to be transported into heaven. On the other side of the Jordan, EUjah asks Elisha if there is anything the prophet can do for his successor. Elisha responds by saying, "I pray you, let me inherit a double share of your spirit" (2 Kings 2:9). Elijah then stipulates that if EUsha sees him taken into heaven, then EUsha's wish w?l be granted. Elisha sees EUjah transported in the chariot of fire, and subsequently employs the mantle to divide Jordan's waters and return to the "world of man" as EUjah's succes sor. The exact text of this "crossing over" is significant. When EUsha reaches Jordan's shore, he "took up the mantle of Elijah that had faUen from Him" and then struck the water with it, saying, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" (2 Kings 2:13-14). The waters part at this moment,</page><page sequence="14">628 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER suggesting that the Lord is in the mande, the emblem of prophecy and the object by which prophetic power is transferred. Elisha's witnessing of a moment of mortal transcendence and his return, by means of the mande, to his former place and condition enacts a modification in the situation and function of the prophet. Unlike Elijah, Elisha has confirmation of the prophet's ability to transcend corporal limits in order to attain, within the corporal, the spiritually transcendent. More over, the mantle of concealment serves as the instrument by which the power of prophecy is not only transferred but doubled; Elijah's potency rests, in the form of the mantle, on Elisha, who is empowered not merely by his own abilities but by Elijah's. Elisha can, like Elijah, cross over into transcendent territory, but, in addition, he can return from this realm in order to speak of it. He is given concrete affirmation of mortal transcen dence that Elijah was not. However, it is also clear that the power of prophecy does not rest within the prophet himself but, instead, in the mantle (text), which can "fall off" the prophet, as it does with Elisha. It is important to note that the "falling off" of the mantle is emphasized in the biblical text in a repetition of the information: Then [Elisha] took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces. And he took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. Then he took the mande of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water . . . (2 Kings 2:12-14) The mantle falls off when Elisha rends his clothes in mourning for Elijah. Prophecy, represented by the mantle, is its own eternity, and does not rely at all on the body as the vehicle of its transmission. Nor is the body guaranteed immortality as a result of the prophetic statement. Elijah's assumption into heaven is not the result of his power of prophecy, but stems from his relationship with God, who acts out of love for Elijah and an understanding of Elijah's fear of death. The change in the situation and function of the prophet, combined with the double empowerment that takes place, is that Elijah's power to affirm God's presence, which is signified in his name, "The Lord is God," is combined with the power signified by the name Elisha, which means "God is salvation." Alone, each voice or name has its limitation; combined, they become a unity in which God's presence is affirmed and where affirmation becomes the means of salvation: "The Lord is God and God is salvation." Thus, Elisha can proclaim the very thing which Elijah could not proclaim, even as Elisha's prophetic position is not possible without Elijah's precur sorship. Kings 1 and 2, primarily the stories of Elijah and Elisha respectively, promote through the text's style the different empowerments made possible</page><page sequence="15">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 629 through the name, and the transformation in the function of the prophet that the name engenders. For example, when EUjah brings the dead ch?d of the woman with whom he lodges back to life, she responds by saying, "Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth" (i Kings 17:18-24). The suggestion here is that the prophet is the conduit for transmission of the divine voice. However, EUsha, unUke EUjah, never speaks direcdy with God, and the nature of his miracles is significantly different. After EUjah is transported by the chariot of fire, the sons of the prophets acknowledge EUsha, saying, "The spirit of EUjah rests on EUsha" (2 Kings 2:15). God's power working through EUsha is affirmed when the men of the city ask him to transform their bad water into good water. Elijah takes a bowl of water with salt in it and throws it into the spring, saying, "Thus says the Lord, I have made this water wholesome; henceforth neither death nor miscarriage shaU come from it" (2 Kings 2:19-22). The phrase "thus says the Lord" is often seen as weU in the miracles of EUjah; however, the striking difference is that it is also usuaUy confirmed with a statement that indicates the direct speaking of the Lord to Elijah. These reaffirmations of the discursive relationship between God and prophet do not occur in the teUing of Elisha's miracles. Here, the difference between EUjah's function as a vehicle for direct transmission of God's word and Elisha's position as mediator of God's word becomes apparent. It is interesting to note as weU that Elijah's relationship with God, Uke Byron's, exiles him from discourse with the community. EUsha's history, Uke Blake's, indicates that he was a part of a prophetic community and fuUy engaged with both kings and armies wh?e he was a prophet. His role in the community, participating in its da?y intrigues, is essential in a way not evinced by Elijah. For EUsha, the mantle functions as the instrument of prophetic power. The power does not reside in his being, but in the way in which he wields the mantle, which, as I noted earlier, can be likened to a text. For Blake/EUsha, if sacred biblical texts are poems of "Probable impossibiUties," then they are so by means of the rhetorical power which the poet/prophet generates in transcribing them. In the Annotations to Watson, Blake discusses the connection between prophecy and rhetoric, saying that "Prophets, in the modern sense of the word, have never existed. Jonah was no prophet in the modern sense, for his prophecy of Nineveh fa?ed" (617). Prophecy never was the unmediated transmission of the divine voice, according to Blake, but rather the art of establishing the prophet as a communicator of truth by means of rhetorical skiU. The Orator or prophet persuades his audience that he is to be believed. He arranges or constructs his work in order to create the condition in which beUef is fostered. He has "designs" upon his audience, although he may work his w?es for beneficent ends.</page><page sequence="16">630 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER In short, there is nothing of the "miraculous" in the prophecies. Blake has no interest in maintaining that his work has anything other than a rhetorical force, for it is the rhetorical art that convinces man that he sees what he had never before thought it possible to see. Such were Christ's miracles which Blake equates with the miracles of persuasion wrought by Paine's Age of Reason: The manner of a miracle being performed is in modern times consid ered as an arbitrary command of the agent upon the patient, but this is an impossibility, not a miracle, neither did Jesus ever do such a miracle. Is it a greater miracle to feed five thousand men with five loaves than to overthrow all the armies of Europe with a small pamphlet? Look over the events of your own life &amp; if you do not find that you have both done such miracles &amp; lived by such you do not see as I do. True, I cannot do a miracle thro' experiment &amp; to domineer over &amp; prove to others my superior power, as neither could Christ. . . . How can Watson ever believe the above sense of a miracle, who considers it an arbitrary act of the agent upon an unbelieving patient, whereas the Gospel says that Christ could not do a miracle because of Unbelief? (616?17) The domain associated with prophecy and inspiration is power, and it governs the redefinition of prophecy, inspiration, and miracle. Prophecy is poetry that establishes the credibility of the poet. The prophet fabricates his work to create the conditions of belief and to obtain power, and he is inspired to the degree that he succeeds, in the new sense of the ability to regenerate imaginatively the experience of faith. In light of this under standing, Elisha's lack of direct discourse with God doesn't diminish pro phetic power, but indicates an expanded prophetic capacity, since it occurs within the framework of a faith no longer supported by an obvious anthropomorphism. Byron institutes the split with the genealogy of literary biblical exegesis in the "Preface" to his play, where he distances himself from Milton and the tradition of biblical interpretation espoused by Milton. Despite subti tling his play a "mystery," Byron insists that he has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common, formerly, as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions. . . . Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put upon this, I take the words as I find them, and reply, with Bishop Watson upon similar occasions, when the Fathers were quoted to him, as Moderator in the schools</page><page sequence="17">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 631 of Cambridge, "Behold the Book!"?holding up the Scriptures. (Pref ace to Cain 626) Despite the suspicion that might arise in Blake were he to take Byron's reference to Bishop Watson UteraUy, "To take the words as [he] finds them" hearkens to Blake's belief that Byron read the Bible spirituaUy, as a "diabolic" Bible which resists traditional forms of exegesis. Byron's state ment that his subject "has nothing to do with the New Testament" signals his refusal to read the Old Testament as a precontextuaUzation of the later text (Preface 629). And his withdrawal of God's voice from his interpre tation of Cain's faU lays the groundwork for Blake's conception of him as a true prophet who uses rhetorical force to estabUsh his credibUity as prophet, rather than as a vessel through which God originaUy speaks. Because Byron is able to estabUsh the veracity of his text through his figuring of Cain, his text is "inspired," and has the same power over its readers as a text which has been produced by an "authority." Blake's understanding of Byron's text "mantles" him as Byron/EUjah's successor, and aUows him to continue the work begun by his precursor. If Blake is to continue within the prophetic genealogy, then within The Ghost of Abel he must fulfill his obligation to proclaim that the "Lord is salvation." In order to do so, Blake must indicate not so much where Byron erred as where Adam and Eve erred in their conception of God, popularized by contemporary biblical exegesis. Elohim, the third eye of God in Blake's system, was responsible not merely for man's creation, but also for the dividing of good and ev?, thereby creating the possibiUty of judgment and vengeance. Blake also connects Adam and Eve with the dividing of good and ev?, so it is natural to associate them with the narration of God which occurs with the FaU (into history) and thus with Elohim as the narrated God. Blake would surely attribute Lucifer's description of God in Cain: A Mystery to Elohim, who Sit[s] on his vast and sohtary throne, Creating words, to make eternity Less burthensome to his immense existence And unparticipated sohtude; Let him crowd orb on orb: he is alone Indefinite, indissoluble tyrant; Could he but crush himself, 't were the best boon He ever granted: but let him reign on, And multiply himself in misery! (1.1.148-56)</page><page sequence="18">632 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER In his color print The Elohim Creating Adam Blake portrays Elohim as a huge, bearded angel who looms over a tortured Adam, wrapped in the coils of a serpent while a blood-red sun sets in the background.10 When Eve violendy curses Cain in Byron's play, the God in whose name she speaks is the equivalent of Blake's Elohim, who swear "Vengeance for Sin" in Blake's The Ghost of Abel. Elohim, then, was the God of Adam and Moses, until the true God of Mercy revealed himself to Moses on Mount Horeb. However, as Blake's illustrations attest, Moses, as well as the first family in Byron's Cain, only half-saw God. Moses desired to fulfill God's directive to create out of a group of disparate nations a community of priests who worshipped the living God and obeyed His laws. However, Moses, as represented in The Book of Ahania through Fuzon, fails, because, as Leslie Tannenbaum notes, his desire to communicate with God face-to-face?as opposed to the people's desire to work always through a mediator because they feared direct confrontation with God?led to the vagaries of priest hood.11 Tannenbaum explains that Moses desired, through legislation, to make manifest a hidden God to a people who would not accept His presence (Great Code of Art 230). Under pressure to establish this law, Moses created a situation in which "the fiery law [became] petrified into stone tablets, that the living passion for righteousness and justice [became] em bodied in laws that . . . only promote [d] self-righteousness and compla cency" (Great Code of Art 228). Thus, Moses unwittingly fabricates a God, portrayed through the law, who becomes Elohim, the God of righteousness and punishment. In The Ghost of Abel, it becomes clear that the two versions of God, Elohim and Jehovah, are necessary to each other, since sin cannot be forgiven until it is judged to be sin. This necessary dependence between Elohim and Jehovah is reflected as well in Jerusalem (61: 1-2) and Milton (14: 26). But Blake stipulates in The Ghost of Abel that it is Jehovah who must always take precedence. When the Elohim realize that vengeance always implies torment, both for the judged and the judges, they split, "trembling over The Mercy Seat, each in his station fixt in the Firmament by Peace, Brotherhood and Love" (53). In Byron's Cain, Eve speaks for the Elohim in her judgment of Cain, but it is God's angelic emissary who offers the last word of forgiveness and protection to Eve's tragically errant son. Cain, who describes himself as having lived a "dreary dream" from which the murder awakens him, may not be any better off at the end of io.

Byron further distances himself from the tradition of Genesis and Moses in his treatment of Cain's faU. From the play's outset, Cain resists the narrative, Elohistic figuration of God offered him by Adam and Abel, refusing to sacrifice or participate in the dubious activity of priestcraft. However, after he returns from his wanderings with Lucifer, we discover that he earlier promised Abel to participate in the sacrificial ritual. Taking his instructions from Abel, Cain places the fruits on the altar and then offers God a chaUenge in the form of a prayer unequivocaUy opposed to Abel's. Acceptance of the offering is built on a condition which Cain states: "If thou must be propitiated with prayers, / Take them! If thou must be induced with altars, / And soften'd with a sacrifice, receive them!" (2.1.251-53). When a whirlwind throws down Cain's altar, Cain abdicates his position as reader/interpreter by acceding to Abel's assessment of the sacrifice's fa?ure. He fa?s to rea?ze that the condition he places on the sacrifice suggests that God's refusal signifies agreement with his position. Thus, when Cain expe riences the living God directly, he inadvertently denies the encounter by rendering credence to Abel's interpretation. Moses' d?emma is played out in Cain, who rejects his opportunity to become a Uving prophet embody ing the Uving God and, instead, opts for the mediated, institutionaUzed interpretation against which he has consistently rebeUed. Byron reverts to a literal rendering of the bibUcal text at the play's conclusion, where the transition from an Elohist to a Yahwehistic inter pretation of God takes place. Wh?e Byron avoids aUowing God to deUver the interrogation of Cain that takes place after the murder (Genesis 4:10 15), an angel acting as God's emissary does so, marking Cain from "Ex emption from such deeds as [he] hast done" (3.1.498). Even though Cain doubts whether his God can forgive him and whether he can forgive himself, Byron has affirmed the presence of the God of love and forgive ness. In this manner, Byron fulfiUs his role as EUjah/prophet, even though the play ends with Cain's disbelief in God as salvation. At this point the text of Byron's play becomes the mande of prophecy which Blake puts on. His task, in The Ghost of Abel, is to prove that "The Lord is salvation," which he performs through his examination of the self-divided God of Genesis. Cain's inabiUty to be?eve that he is forgiven at the end of Cain: A Mystery reflects his bondage to Elohim, as does Blake's portrayal of him in "The Body of Abel Found by Adam and Eve" (Keynes, plates 15 a-b, 2). However, the Elohim at the conclusion to The Ghost of Abel are subdued, "... each in his station fixt in the Firmament by Peace Brotherhood and Love" (26). Satan, the Elohim, and the ghost of Abel?aU of whom incarnate the principles of judgement, punishment, and blood lust at war with Jehovah?w?l be sacrificed to Jehovah, in the form of</page><page sequence="20">634 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER Christ, on Calvary (18-21). The sacrifice becomes positive, and death "holy," since in The Ghost of Abel it is inverted in order to make redemp tion possible. Cain's inaugurating of death into the world thus, in Blake's schema, makes possible salvation from the Fall and the death sentence which attends it. Through the mantle of Byron's text, Blake has become doubly empowered as prophet. The "still small voice," or the deferred reciprocity that occurs between reading and writing, the passageway of which Derrida would call God, imprints itself on Blake's text, making it the actively engaged "other" whose voice is neither God's nor Blake's, where "God is Man &amp; exists in us &amp; we in Him." Blake's association of Byron with Elijah constitutes Cain: A Mystery as a type of sacred writing which confirms both God's existence and the prophet's status. This attestation occurs between the work of writing and reading, between sacred text and hermeneutics. Blake acknowledges By ron's prophetic work and further discerns that Byron's text affirms that the "Lord is God." In Byron's play, Cain does not doubt the existence of God; however, he is extremely frustrated by his inability to confront God, whose counseling voice in Genesis is removed by Byron in his rewriting of the first murder. Cain struggles to comprehend his human, mortal condition and why he should suffer for the sins of his parents. For Byron's Cain, the beauty of God's natural works is an insufficient exemplum for an under standing of the human condition. Thus, the absence of God's voice and presence in Byron's drama?a voice which explains to Cain the danger he is in and which stabilizes the parameters of moral choice?is striking and pertinent. Cain must work from the narration of God given to him by his parents, a law of narration and a narration of law that is inherently repressive and incessandy illogical. Byron's reinterpretation of Cain aligns him with Elijah in their under standing of the power of mortality, of the fear which death inspires and which prevents both of them from proclaiming that the "Lord is salvation." It is here precisely that Blake sees the operations of the prophetic. For Blake, Byron as poet/prophet speaks for God and affirms His presence, but he does so at the same time that he distinguishes between the God who must be absent to be God and the God constructed through narrative. Blake posits that the true God contains all things, including evil. The claim that Blake's purpose was to join the many who criticized the play is further undercut when we read the remainder of Blake's address in light of Elijah's story. Blake, a rhetorical interrogator not unlike Byron's Cain and Elijah's God, asks: Can a Poet doubt the Visions of Jehovah? Nature has no Outline: but Imagination has.</page><page sequence="21">BLAKE'S READING OF BYRON'S CAIN 635 Nature has no Tune: but Imagination has! Nature has no Supernatural &amp; dissolves: Imagination is Eternity. The traditional response to Blake's play, that it is a criticism of Byron, stems from a misinterpretation not necessarily of the content, but of the "after spirit" of this address. Without the story of Elijah hovering in the background, the lines might be considered not merely a critique of Byron but a remonstrance as weU. However, understanding EUjah's fear of death even in the face of Jehovah's moving of mountains clearly indicates that the prophet/poet can doubt the vision of God without chastisement, particularly if his name and function?Byron/Elijah?limit him to under standing that the "Lord is God" and prevent him from understanding that the "Lord is salvation." If Blake had wished to comment on Byron's shortcomings as a prophet, then Blake's play does so to the extent that it is a completion of Byron's work made possible only through Byron's "mantling" of Blake; Byron's play is the mande which confers Blake with prophetic powers. Blake inherits a double portion of Byron's power be cause he sees the greatness of Byron's work, just as Elisha saw EUjah carried into heaven. Traditional biblical interpretation, as I indicated earUer, suggests that EUjah was assumed into heaven without dying so that he could return to herald the Messiah's arrival. Since the Messiah is the "Savior," God gives EUjah the opportunity to redefine his prophetic boundaries by proclaiming that "the Lord is salvation." During the New Testament Transfiguration, EUjah appears with Moses, and both speak to Christ. After witnessing the vision, the aposdes foUow Christ down the mountain, where he instructs them to ". . . TeU the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead" (Matthew 17:9). The disciples respond by asking him, Why then say the scribes that EUas must first come? and Jesus answered and said unto them, EUas truly shaU first come, and restore aU things. But I say unto you, That EUas is come already, and they know him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shaU also the Son of man suffer of them. Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. (Matthew 17:10-13).12 From Blake's viewpoint, if Byron is the nineteenth-century EUjah, and EUjah "Comprehends AU Prophetic Characters," then Byron is also John the Baptist, and the literary reception of his "bating of the bigots" (Tan nenbaum, "Lord Byron in the WUderness" 353) is the equivalent of martyrdom. By extension, Blake fulfiUs the part of Messiah. This is not a 12. Cf. Mark 9:2-9; Luke 9:23-27.</page><page sequence="22">636 KERRY ELLEN MCKEEVER delusion of grandeur for Blake, but the embodiment of his belief in an abstracted typology . . . synonymous with the creative process itself. The discovery or the creation of signs is a typological process in that all imaginative activity is a reenactment of the Incarnation, the process whereby the human and the divine merge through the imaginative transformation of the objects of sense into human form. (Tannenbaum, Great Code of Art gg) In the Laocoon engraving, Blake states specifically that "The Eternal Body of Man is the imagination." Individuals are members of the body of Jesus, who is inhered in the divine body of God (273). Byron and Blake, in their imaginative recreation of the experience of faith through art, become members of the Messianic body where the Lord, indeed, is salvation. The transformation of the world into text, as a reinforcement of Blake's concept that all experience is interpreted and that interpretation governs ontology, appears at the climax of Jerusalem: "... and every Word &amp; every character / Was Human" (98: 35-36). Here is an uncommon use of "Character" that is ambiguous in Blake, where it means both "letter" and "Person," as it does, coincidentally, when he addresses Byron at the beginning of The Ghost of Abel. Blake explicitly equates seeing and reading as Vision at this point: "and I heard Jehovah speak / Terrific from his Holy Place, &amp; saw the Words of the Mutual Covenant Divine" (98: 40-42). The end of Jerusalem proposes an identification between the product of Vision? that is, the identity of all particulars in Jerusalem?the state of vision, and the text Jerusalem itself. Blake's reading of Byron complicates and expands this notion. Byron's Cain: A Mystery is the vision; the text produces the vision by teaching Blake how to read. Blake, in turn, creates another (re)visionary text with twofold power, for it instructs us not only how to read Blake in the text's literal turning back to Jerusalem by means of the final engraving, but also how to read Byron. To ignore the allegiance between the two is to deny the space which both inhabit. Both Byron and Blake mark the path to the prophetic territory to which the "golden string," whose source is inside the wall of Jerusalem, leads; to follow the path of the string is to enter the wall of the text, both a mande and a "heaven's gate" which makes possible prophecy as well as the dissemination of interpretation.
