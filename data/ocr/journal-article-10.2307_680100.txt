Nor- man: University of Oklahoma Press, 1990. 182 pp. $48.50 (cloth). ALANA CORDY-COLLINS University of San Diego This recent publication is a welcome con- tribution to the study of Andean prehistory. Paul's fluid and highly readable style ani- mates her solid research and illuminates a shadowy area of the Peruvian past. Her study is an analysis of Paracas textiles excavated from the South Coast during the 1920s, and stored in Lima's National Museum.</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL/CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 225 The first of the book's eight chapters is a re- view of the circumstances of the textiles' dis- covery and its aftermath. This historical vi- gnette lays the groundwork for Paul's study. A second chapter focuses on the cultural role textiles play and have played in the Andean area. This section, too, provides a foundation upon which Paul later builds an interpretative argument for the original role of the Paracas textiles. The geographical descriptions in the third chapter furnish a background against which the textiles and their makers can be viewed. The fourth chapter details the "anat- omy" of the two mummy bundles that yielded the textile sample for Paul's study. Chapter 5 is a textile typology. Chapter 6 discusses the three stylistic variants of Paracas weaving and what they suggest. In chapter 7 Paul investi- gates the symbolic meaning of the images crafted by the Paracas weavers. This icono- graphic analysis is a fascinating study and provides an extensive examination of Paracas ideology. However, this analysis is not without controversy, as I discuss below. The last chap- ter is a brief conclusion. Three areas of Paul's study are of particular interest. First is the interpretation of why there are three distinct styles of Paracas woven imagery. Paul suggests that the three styles are overlapping or coeval, and that they are family or personal styles. Her support for this is that examples of each style are derived from the bundles of only one or two individuals. Second, Paul contends that each of the two mummy bundles contained both textiles that were the personal property of the individual wrapped therein, and textiles that were gifts. Her contention is based on two points. The first is that she has identified "sets" of clothing in a single bundle. Items which do not appear to belong to a set, she reasons, may have been given to the deceased. The second point in her gift argument is that each bundle contained some textiles that were of inferior quality to those of a set, and thus, were commissioned by someone of lesser status than the interred. From this, Paul concludes that the two indi- viduals whose textiles she examined were rul- ers. Her argument is provocative, and it would be very interesting to know the age and sex of the mummies. Unfortunately, the bundles were unwrapped long before Paul began her study, and the component parts were dissem- inated throughout the National Museum ac- cording to material class. Presumably, those mummies are still in the physical anthropol- ogy section of the Museum, but attempting to locate them would have been a daunting task. A third area of interest is Paul's interpreta- tion oficonography. Images on the textiles in- clude a considerable range of characters, most of which are anthropomorphic. These individ- uals, Paul tells us, represent disguised hu- mans, "ritually costumed dancers who imper- sonated cult images and spirits at religious fes- tivals" (p. 85). Her support for this interpre- tation is slight. Comparisons are drawn from 16th-century Spanish accounts of activities that took place some 1,700 to 1,800 years after the Paracas culture. She cites a single cape of condor feathers associated with a Paracas bur- ial and Paracas ceramic masks as representa- tives of the costumes shown in the woven im- agery. Although her support is scanty, I find her interpretation at least as equally reason- able as the traditional anthropological-art historical one: that such figures represent su- pernaturals. The latter interpretation assumes that prehistoric people carried around mental images of their deities that they could (and did) transcribe without some intermediate ve- hicle. Paul's interpretation provides that ve- hicle. Yet, for the sake of the reader, it would have been instructive to discuss why she opted for an alternative assessment. Ultimately, though, the distinction between deity and de- ity impersonator may be moot. Western cul- ture sees such distinctions, non-Western cul- tures often do not. Paracas Ritual Attire is a tight, well-devel- oped study and contributes substantially to what is known of ancient Paracas culture.</page></plain_text>
