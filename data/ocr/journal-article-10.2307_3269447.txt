<plain_text><page sequence="1">AAIMQN IN HOMER BY F. A. WILFORD Englefield Green Aaloc.ov is a word with a long history and its meaning is hard to define, particularly as a definition seemingly valid for one period of Greek thought might not hold good for another. For instance, in Homer the word is mostly held to refer to some vaguely personal, usually hostile and always uncanny force at large in the world, alien and ex- ternal to the human personality; while in later writers it is often used in a very different sense, that of a divine being, not a major god, in a special and often beneficial relation to the individual, so that a man could speak of "his aoctup4v". So strange a shift of meaning calls for investigation, and in what follows I wish to examine the Homeric usages of the word in order to see if the possibility of this development was already latent in the Homeric poems themselves. Three preliminary difficulties must first be touched upon. Firstly, there would be disagreement among modern authorities even within the terms of a definition as wide as that given above for the meaning of aoc4pov in the Homeric poems. Nilsson 1) would object to the use of the word "personal", preferring to compare aoaccov with some im- personal force such as mana. Rose 2) on the other hand sees it as personal, on the strength of the suffix-Po)v,which always implies a personal agent; and Dodds 3) inclines to Rose's view. Here then is a clear difference of opinion, but one perhaps in which neither side is wholly right, being based on what is for this age a false distinction. A purely impersonal force could only be a mechanical force, and this is a concept which implies a mode of thought inappropriate at this period. At a much later date Empedocles, for example, is still found to be using the terms Love and Strife to apply to forces which we I) Geschichte der Griechischen Religion Bd. I, 2nd Ed.

NUMEN XII I5</page><page sequence="2">F. A. Wilford should distinguish as being at one time mechanical, at another personal. But for him no such distinction was possible. His view was still com- prehensive enough to demand that the forces at work in the macrocosm should be in essence no different from those at work in man; and this at a time when Parmenides had already implicitly raised the problem of the cause of motion. Still less should such a distinction be imputed to Homer. If therefore we do not allow that Homer's aoctIov was felt to represent an impersonal force, it is yet equally difficult to regard it as personal either, for no trace of personality attaches to it. It simply acts, with no "I" or "he" discernible as the author of the action. Per- haps the relevant aspects of both sides of the false antithesis personal/ impersonal could best be summed up in the word "living". When one of Homer's men spoke of aocptov, he meant a living unknown, alive as he was alive, but unrestricted by the limitations of personality. Thus to accept accipxov as a living supernatural agency leads to the second difficulty, one which poses a question which could at once dis- pose of the whole problem: namely to ask whether 8acLpov does not after all simply mean any god not named, and so act as a vague syno- nym for 0?6o; its use being due to a desire for variety, to metrical convenience, or to the mere repetition of a formula. There are two objections to this. Firstly, if ever aocitov should seem to mean 0zoq, it is surprisingly difficult to say which god is being referred to. Fran- ;ois 4) lists seven cases in which aoLxWov might refer to a particular deity; and of these only one in my opinion is at all certain, that at Iliad 3, 420, where a,i tov refers back to Aphrodite just mentioned (though Francois oddly thinks that the reference is to Athena). On this passage Snell 5) agrees that aocitov is indeed synonymous with Aphrodite, and was used to emphasise the baleful and uncanny power exercised by this goddess, whose infatuation of Helen caused so much suffering. Secondly, aoptwov is a word much used by the characters, but rarely by the poet himself. 6) It occurs in the singular 59 times in all, but only I times in the unspoken narrative; and of these II instances, 7 are accounted for by the use of a single formula.

This after all is natural, if we broadly accept Herodotus' remark that it was Homer and Hesiod who assigned the gods their names and stations. The poet's knowledge of divine affairs is wider than that of men of earlier times, whose story he tells. This implies that the use of Caiocpov with an in- definite reference is older than the use of 06qo with a definite referen- ce; whence it follows that the words are not merely synonyms. The difference in meaning between the two words leads to the con- clusion that actLVov had reference to the early experience of the un- differentiatedly "numinous". To put the matter broadly and even na- ively, the poets whom we in general call Homer took this area of the numinous and carved bits out of it gradually, labelling each piece with the ancient name of a god with particular functions; but there were so to speak some bits left over, and to these the old name of &amp;ac4ov was still indiscriminately applied; and it was historically appropriate that the areas covered by actxtov should be wider for the characters than for the poet. Further, since the area of the gods was anthropo- morphised, it was naturally less uncanny and inhuman than the so far unoccupied territory of 8aC[tov, and this is what we find. As the Homeric poems are the result of slow elaboration by many poets, there is naturally a good deal of overlapping between the two "areas" described. For example, there is a famous passage in the Iliad (I5, 458 ff.) in which Teucer aims an arrow at Hector with the intention of finishing off the whole war at one blow, only to find that his bowstring breaks at the crucial moment. Responsibility for this mis- fortune is variously allocated. The poet and Hector attribute it to Zeus himself, Ajax to some angry god. These however are at some distance from the immediate action. Teucer, on whom the blow chiefly falls, in haste and exasperation unreflectingly lays the whole blame on aoptcov. This one passage contains three levels of religious apprehension, mo- ving from that of the merely supernatural to that of some god who cannot be named, and thence to a god who can be named. One further preliminary difficulty remains. Should one refer to the subject of this enquiry simply as &amp;8ctlzov without the article - the method so far used - or as "the" or "a 8aLoc(ov " as occasion might require? Obviously the implications in each case are very different. 2I9</page><page sequence="4">F. A. Wilford The Greek is of little help here, as 6 aocx.cov is not found in Homer 7) and of course there is no indefinite article, so that one is left with the question of whether, in translation or in general reference, to supply an article on one's own initiative. If the definite article is supplied, the implication is that a particular deity is being referred to, but this, as already noted, does not seem to be the poet's intention. Dodds 8) quotes Nilsson on this point: "By using the word aocai.ov he 'expresses the fact that a higher power has made something happen', and this fact is all he knows". The only exception to this is the above quoted passage from the Iliad, 3, 420, where the best translation would be "the aoc.tpcov", i.e. Aphrodite. In all other cases the use of the indefinite article seems much more attractive. But unfortunately even this could be misleading, as the phrase "a 8a0LPov " might imply "some particular spirit, one out of many, who could in principle be named". This how- ever does not seem to be the implication in actual usage. For example, when in Od. 12, I69, Odysseus says that ariwcov stilled the sea, the tenor of the passage does not lead one to suppose that if pressed he would have said that in fact he meant Amphitrite or Nereus or some other. All he had in mind was the general notion of supernatural power. In this case one might maintain that the difference between a80[ctoL) and "a 8oaL .ov" is that between generalised supernatural power and such power in a particular manifestation. But for Homer this distinction has no force, since he is always describing events, and so for him Sa[itcov always appears in a particular manifestation; (whence Usener9) called aoplcwo an "Augenblicksgott"). Indeed, this whole question may ultimately be irrelevant. oaLtc,ov is a homogeneous reservoir of power, and it makes little dif- ference whether in any one instance one refers to all (acx(cov) or some ("a, the aocicov") of it, since the essential attribute of uncanny power is preserved either way. The effect is the same and it is the effect that matters for Homer. These effects may now be considered in less general terms, and may 7) W. C. Greene (Moira, Fate, Good and Evil in Greek Thought, Harvard U.P.

The first class is characterised by the formula gaC(,ovL laoq, which is found nine times in the Iliad, though never in the Odyssey. It al- ways occurs at the end of the line following the bucolic diaeresis - whence it appears to belong to the most primitive level of the Epic. 10) One example is typical of them all. At Iliad 5, 431 ff. Diomedes makes three desperate attacks upon Aeneas, who is defended by Apollo. But when he makes a fourth assault 80ctovl laoq, Apollo himself has to warm him off and remind him that men are not the equals of gods. The formula then is used of a man who has gone beserk, and is persisting, usually for the fourth time, in some desperate action which will destroy him. Such a man is clearly not acting in his own best interests, or even of his own volition. He cannot attend to his preservation, or even know what he is doing. He has ceased to be his normal self, and is said to resemble some supernatural power - and is indeed fully in the grip of that power. The second class of instances, by far the best represented of the three, shows ~aacYov still affecting the individual as it were from the outside, but in a much less wholesale manner. In these cases Sacttcov is blamed for some external physical event which directly affects the individual, usually adversely. For example, as already cited, Teucer blames it for breaking his bowstring. At Il. 21, 93, Lycaon complains that 8aoItov has driven him back to face Achilles for the second time. At Od. I6, 370, Alcinous complains that 8aitov brought Telemachus back just at the wrong moment, and at Od. 19, 20o Odysseus says that it raised a storm against him. One of the rare cases in which the action of acupcov is beneficial is the opposite of the last cited, when at Od. 12, I69 8aiLptuov puts the waves to rest as Odysseus approaches the Sirens. The third class, confined mainly to the Odyssey, is comparatively small but most interesting. In this, the power of aocdttov operates inter- nally upon the individual's thoughts or feelings. In Od. 19, 138, oc,ucov suggests to Penelope the stratagem of the web, in Od. 20, 87, it sends her evil dreams. When Odysseus' men are about to blind Polyphemus, it sends them an access of courage (Od. 9, 381). At II.

VIII, 2244 ff. 221</page><page sequence="6">F. A. Wilford of a0ctLov -where the latter seems to act as a sort of hidden per- suader. Such a classification has to be to some extent arbitrary, since there are, mostly in the Iliad, a few instances which do not fit into any of these categories. In the Odyssey the meaning of 8aCtptov seems to have crystallised out a little more, particularly in the third class mostly found therein. This points ahead to later uses of the word, for instance that found in Plato's myth of Er, where aoCpucov has become the daimon which accompanies a man throughout life. It should now be clear that already in Homer &amp;aocduov was a word of manifold significance. It is therefore of some interest to try to see if the word has any underlying meaning, unexpressed and at the time perhaps inexpressible, which would account both for the varieties of Homeric usage and also for the ambiguities and perplexities which beset its subsequent development. Briefly and in modern terms, I wish to suggest that the operation of ociulov represents the working of what we should call the unconscious mind, with its necessarily accompanying mechanism of projection. To suggest this is to run the risk of ex- plaining an ignotum by an ignotius, and it must remain an hypothesis incapable of final proof; the best that can be done is to test it out against the facts. The most relevant aspect of the theory of the unconscious is, for the present purpose, the axiom that all that is unconscious is projected: 11) experienced not directly, but as if reflected back from the environment. As any psychic element is unconscious only because the conscious mind cannot accept it, these reflections are felt as somehow disturbing. A person can feel that in certain situations there resides a hostile force directed uniquely at himself, and if this experience is persistent enough he can claim that he is in the grip of fate. In fact he is receiving from experience what he has already unwittingly put into it; and in prin- ciple can come to understand that when he saw hostility in certain persons and situations he was all the time seeing himself. What at one time seemed entirely external has been shown to be quite internal. If such unconscious activity is a permanent aspect of our nature, we can look for evidence of its effects in ancient times as well as in our own and it seems that just these effects are to be observed in the ii) C. G. Jung, Collected Works Vol. VII, p. I95; also J. Jacobi, The Psy- chology of C. G. Jung, p. o19. 222</page><page sequence="7">Aoaitcov in Homer sort of experience attributed to the activity of Soacov. It is an un- defined external power, with, on its first appearance in the phrase 8ai[ovL laoq , strongly irrational associations. It can manipulate events in a hostile manner, so that the individual feels powerless against it. In this sense it can almost be equated with fate, as indeed it was. It can also work internally, so as to affect the mind without the indivi- dual's conscious intention, and even - as in Od. 5, 396 - send sick- ness on the body. Yet it has also a curiously double aspect. As already noted, it acts internally as well as externally. On occasion, it can send good as well as ill; and though by the most probable derivation a power that apportions,12) it can also be that which is apportioned - as in Hector's phrase rr0pog rotL oaLovoc acrco (I1. 8, I66), where aaidtova can only mean "what you are fated to receive", i.e., death. This is an ambiguity it shares with the word ptoipoc and with our word "fate". All this is Homeric. If we look to later times, we find, as before mentioned, that Plato gives the name aoctov to the spirit that a man before birth, and for no very good reason, chooses as his guide for life. In non- mythical terms, accpiov here is the unconscious determinant of all ac- tion, persisting throughout life. The term "unconscious" should not of course be used as a sort of blanket that can explain everything simply because it means nothing in particular. Yet if in modern times a man claimed to have had an ex- perience that was uncanny, ambiguous and of unique significance for himself, we should justifiably feel that a projection of his own was responsible. In similar circumstances one of Homer's men would have laid the responsibility on accitov. The areas of experience covered by the words atptcov and "unconscious" seem to be broadly similar. If this is really the case, it should be possible to find evidence of it in the three classes outlined above. In the case of artvcvt Tcog, the process of going berserk may be described as follows. A man has in himself forces that are usually re- pressed, i.e., kept unconscious. In the stress of battle this repression is lifted, and the forces have their way. Since they are such as the man would not normally acknowledge, they appear to him as an outside force that grips him: they are projected, and he is possessed by them. But to the spectators, who see only the man's actions and not his state 12) Nilsson, op. cit., p. 2I8. 223</page><page sequence="8">F. A. Wilford of mind, he appears as the embodiment of them. He is said to be 8aLtoL iaoc,, coequal with Latco,v, and no longer a normal rational being. Lack of rationality, in fact, is what this phrase always implies, as may be seen if we compare similar phrases involving 06o. Fran- cois points out 13) that in these phrases, such as OCo e'vatXyxioq, the point of the comparison is the subject's honour or beauty, not his strength. There is however one phrase in which the comparison addu- ced is in respect of martial prowess, when at II. I6, 784, Patroclus is compared to Ares. But when he goes on to make an even more reckless assault he is no longer compared to a god, not even to the most sub- human of the Olympians, Ares, but this time said to be acmtovL Itoq- Hence Franqois concludes that this phrase is meant to be an "improve- ment" on the earlier one, and that therefore comparison with 8c.[cov cannot be quite the same as comparison with 0O66. It is more to the present purpose however to add that comparison with atoiov is only found in contexts describing a reckless and irresistible use of physical strength. If strength alone of any degree were in question, surely com- parison with 066o would aways be adequate, since superhuman strength is a common divine prerogative. It is only when the use of that strength passes all reason that oaifEcov is invoked. It is not therefore strength alone, but irrationality, the peculiar property of the unconscious, that marks off acx,cov from 0s64. 14) In this first class, the unconscious power of 8at.xov has been so strongly projected on to the situation, that the normal personality is almost entirely superseded. Such a case is as rare as the events that provoke it. More often the projection is only partial, so that while the conscious personality is left intact, odd effects are observed in the en- vironment. This is the sort of mechanism responsible for the second and larger class of instances. When Alcinous finds that Telemachus has returned home in spite of an ambush, he can only say that Gap,ctov brought him back. (There are many other cases in which the formula )^yays 8actpxov is used for a similar purpose). This at first sight seems little more than an alternative method of describing events. Alcinous 13) Op. cit., p. 327. 14) In seven of the nine instances of this phrase the object of the attack is a god, or has the support of a god. On five occasions the god is Apollo, destined to be the god of light and reason, the natural opposite of aloccov. 224</page><page sequence="9">AclJtiov in Homer might just as well have said, "Unluckily for me, Telemachus returned". But he did not put the matter in this way, nor did many others in similar circumstances, and that is what has to be explained. What we are dealing with is in fact a different method not of de- scription, but of perception. When aciptov is thus projected, the out- side world is so saturated with the man's unconscious psyche that he never sees events objectively. Alcinous cannot say that Telemachus returned and that this fact, as it so happened, did not fit in with his plans; he can only say that he returned through the machinations of some unknown power. Similarly Teucer cannot say simply that his bowstring broke, or Odysseus that a storm happened to arise; respon- sibility for these events has to be laid at the door of some unknown living agency. This ascription incidentally adds nothing to our factual knowledge of the event, as might be the case with the intervention of a named god. We know no more than before how or why the event took place; it has merely been presented in an uncanny light. In these two classes the action of a=ptwov is such as to suggest that the unconscious is being projected in a fairly uninhibited manner. But the environment has to be cleansed of such interference if it is ever to be objectively understood and civilised life made more possible. In other words, such projections must sooner or later be withdrawn; and there are, even within the Epic, hints that this process was under way. These are to be found in the third class of examples, and in the whole "divine apparatus". In the third class, the term ocptwov is still in use, but with a markedly interior reference. That is, the event referred to is no longer external and physical, but internal and psychological, and could be described wholly in such terms. Here the task of judging the relevance of 8aop&amp;ov is more than usually delicate, and as a decision in any one case re- quires the support of all the rest, I shall quote all the examples which clearly belong to this class. 15) Firstly, three simple examples which may conveniently be grouped together: At Od. 14, 488, aocl0ov induces Odysseus to leave his cloak behind on a cold night; at Od. I9, io, it gives him the notion that the 15) M. Untersteiner, (I1 Concetto di Aocpov in Omero, Atene e Roma 7, 1939, pp. 99-134) cites a much larger number of examples in which he sees aocILcowvre- ferring to the personality. I cannot follow his example, nor, on occasion, his reasoning. 225</page><page sequence="10">F. A. Wilford sight of weapons might provoke a quarrel; and at Od. I9, 138 it puts the idea of the stratagem of the web into Penelope's mind. The first case is equivalent to "I forgot", the second two to "I had the idea that". In all three the scale of events is so petty that supernatural intervention seems uncalled for; and so it would be, but for the fact that the use of 8axLdcov here might suggest the intervention of the unconscious, which has, so to speak, no sense of proportion. It can indifferently cause a slip of the tongue or affect a whole life. Secondly, some related examples on a larger scale: -In the example last quoted, ao0Cltov was made the subject of the verb p7vtrZv. It is also so used at Od. 9, 381, where aoaipov "breathes might" into Odys- seus' men as they prepare to blind Polyphemus. Comparison with the former case here suggests a sudden inexplicable access of strength from inner sources. At Il. 9, 600, Phoenix has been telling how Meleager saved the Aetolians, but only by giving way to his own feelings, and not at their entreaty. He warns Achilles not to think like that, and not to let aociLpov turn him that way. In this context the phrase [z78? aE 8aLGV vtco 'roca rpts&amp;Ls could well mean "Then let not your feelings drive you to act likewise", making aloCtioV equivalent to Achilles' natural impulsiveness. Again, in the already quoted example I1. 3, 420, it has been said that oalcowv is there used simply as a substitute for the name Aphrodite; but in the light of the other examples now under consideration, could one add that the use of 0cai.cov suggest that Aphro- dite in turn is to some extent the personification of Helen's obsessive love for Paris - which was not consciously determined? In the two following examples, the use of adptcov may point in the same "interiorised" direction. At I1. I , 792, Nestor tells Patroclus that with the help of aoccov he might persuade Achilles to fight. Here, as in the Phoenix passage cited above, 8acfpov is used in conjunction with OuOt6q, and suggests that Achilles' warlike feelings may be aroused if his natural impulsiveness could be provoked into action. 16) Secondly, at Od. 2, I34 ff., Telemachus says that if he sends his mother away he will be made to suffer by her father, by ao(bLcov, by his mother's Erinys, and by his fellows. In this fairly comprehensive list, the place of an external supernatural power is filled by the Erinys, making I6) The same phrase recurs at II. 15, I04, but only as a formulaic repetition. 226</page><page sequence="11">Aatwcov in Homer oaiL.,v either redundant or internal - in which case it would play the part of a guilty conscience. One final example could well sum up the whole trend of meaning which I have been suggesting for aopcov. At Od. 3, 26 f. Athene tells Telemachus that he will think some things in his cpp??Vq, and that G0Cipu)ov will suggest others. In other words Telemachus is being told that some plans will take shape as the result of conscious thought, others from inspiration. If this a true interpretation, &amp;cpwov here is being opposed to cppeveS as the unconscious to the conscious mind. The examples of the last class show that 8aptwov was on the way to being felt as in some sense belonging to the individual. If my earlier assump- tions are allowed, this is another way of saying that projections were being withdrawn from the screen of inanimate nature, and put back where they belonged. This was a necessary stage on the road to self- awareness. In its day, the concept of aod.pov had had great usefulness, as it enabled the speaker to account for the unaccountable without much thought, but at the same time it was an uncomfortable neighbour. Its action was always sporadic, mysterious and irrational, and since it was neither circumscribed by cult nor accessible to prayer, no one ever made sacrifice to it or gave it a myth. 17) Such a state of things might be congenial to the atmosphere of mainland Greece, where magic was still at home, but it was not likely to be tolerated for long in the clearer air of Ionia. The process which gave birth to the fully anthropomorphised gods we meet in Homer, and whose powers steadily encroached upon those of accp,tiv, is a much earlier and wider, but even less conscious ma- nifestation of the movement seen in the examples last discussed. Logically the whole vast complex of the divine apparatus may be re- garded as a phase of development linking class two of my examples with class three. (This incidentally would support the view that the Olympians were originally "powers of nature", if nature is understood as an environment inevitably contaminated by human projections. The alternative view, that they were a reflection of baronial society on earth, would imply a slightly more conscious process, and one less likely therefore to compel belief. But the "origin of the gods" 17) Nilsson, op. cit. p. 217, remarks that in the case of 8aiccov "man nicht an einen Kultgott denkt". 227</page><page sequence="12">F. A. Wilford is hard to find, and no doubt both factors played their part). The intervention of the gods, as opposed to that of xaijoCv, seemed to bring with it a better understanding of events. For example, when Lycaon found himself before Achilles for a second time, all he could say was that some external supernatural power had brought him there. When Priam was brought before Achilles, he could say much more: that Zeus had sent Iris with a message, that Hermes had escorted him, etc. Action ascribed to an external inhuman power has been replaced by action ascribed to external superhuman powers, depicted as the gods on Olympus. 18) The old unitary 8aoc.lov, of necessity regarded as singular because it was not differentiated, has been anthropomorphised and split up into a number of clearly defined 8aipLovSq. 19) This step had enormous advantages. The human character granted to the gods was an acknowledgement 20) of the fact that the apparently uncanny in nature is in origin human, being a displaced part of ourselves. The gods therefore were no longer uncanny or magical, and no longer the object of superstitious dread. They were bright and approachable be- cause, so to speak, their shadows still lay in the residual areas of ocxLi.cov. But the main thing for our present purpose is the fact that their human shape betokens a withdrawal of projections comparable to that suggested for class three. In both cases 8aocutov is on the way to being humanised: in the one, fashioned a man but still left "out there", like a huge image projected on the clouds; in the other, brought within the orbit of the human personality. There were indeed times when both types of example united. When Athena prevented Achilles from slaying Agamemnon, being visible to him alone, she functioned both as an internal monition and as an external divinity. 21) The Olympian stage of the process of withdrawal had of course much more appeal than what I may call the "inner ai,ptov" stage, per- i8) Dodds, loc. cit. p. 14: 'The indeterminate daimon has to be made concrete as some particular god". I9) The plural form occurs only three times in Homer: Il I, 222, 6, 115 and 23, 595. In the first two cases the reference is obviously to the Olympians; in the third it is more vague, and the meaning differs little from that of the singular. 20) I do not of course mean a conscious acknowledgement, any more than I would say that the Olympians were a conscious creation. It would be absurd to attribute any explicit theory of the unconscious to Homer. But the "invention" of the Olympians, with all its implications, was the result of an effort of creative imagination, apt to be half involuntary, as true art is. 21) Il. I. 193 ff. 228</page><page sequence="13">Aalocp.v in Homer haps because a great burden of self-responsibility was thus avoided. The gods were still the ultimately responsible They, and could be treated as in fact Homer's nobles do treat them - they could be bribed, blamed, entreated, argued with and even threatened. All this was prefer- able to the bleak realisation that man was merely expostulating with himself. No doubt also the literary advantages of this incomparable puppet-show were so great as to prolong its life beyond its term. Yet it was not to be expected that this half-way stage could last. In being humanised at all the gods had already lost some of their divinity, and it could not be long before a Xenophanes would rob them of all that remained. The power of 8xoi4cov was for them a steadily diminishing asset. Yet in view of its origins this power was indestructible, and as it drained away from Olympus it had to find a home somewhere else. It could either find its true home in the mind of man, or abandon its advance and return to the physical world, whence the genius of Homer had dislodged it. Both courses were in fact followed. The first of these has already been described. It consisted in granting adpco,v an internal function. The second was adopted by the early philosophers of Ionia. Being dissatisfied with the gods of Homer, they dispensed with all specific notions of divinity, and tried to account for the world on a purely naturalistic basis. Herein lay a kind of 6vplq, for in dismissing the gods, they ignored the reality of axIptovon which they were founded. This was a mistake most likely to appeal to the new scientists. A man of truly religious temperament would not find permanent satisfaction in the Olympians, but in that case he would naturally revert to older sources, as did the Pythagoreans and Orphics, or like Xenophanes formulate a god of his own. The Milesian scientists took the rationalism implicit in Homer to its logical conclusion, and in denying or ignoring his gods they lost the benefits of his anthropomorphism. His divinities had provided a handy cloak under cover of which 8adtov had begun to infiltrate into man. But the Milesians had made it homeless, and being a power not to be trifled with it took an instant revenge. If any unconscious element is allowed the possibility of conscious expression and then suddenly repressed, it will regress to a more archaic level than before, and express itself accordingly. Such was the case withsocixov. While still engaged in finding its own way to the surface via the anthropomorphic gods, it was denied the prospect of further development along those 229</page><page sequence="14">F. A. WIilford lines. It therefore reverted to its archaic form and, for these philo- sophers as for an earlier generation, infected the material environment. Matter for the Milesians was alive, and all nature daimonic; hence Thales could say that all was full of gods. 22) Paradoxically, the old daimonistic world-view that Homer had largely destroyed came alive again in the stronghold of his intellectual heirs. It may seem odd to suggest that the first philosophers, so far ahead of their time in many ways, were in this respect unwittingly behind it. Yet the concept of oaicov and that of hylozoism are in many ways strangely parallel. I have already said that acc4tzov could best be de- scribed as a power neither personal nor impersonal, but living. If Odysseus says that an event such as a storm at sea is caused by such a power, but without further defining that power, he is for all practical purposes describing an event that caused itself - what might be called an animate event. The life inherent in that event is thus analogous to that in animate matter that moves itself; whence the concepts both of aoci,uov and of hylozoism both appear to refer to the same mode of appreciating phenomena. Both in fact are relics of animism, itself a wholesale consequence of the mechanism of projection. Homer and his fellows took the life out of animate events and trans- formed it into the gods who caused the events. This was an advance in imaginative understanding. To say that a storm is caused by an other- wise unknown aicxtov is little more than to say that a storm is a storm. To say that it is caused by a god with human attributes, and with whom one can come to terms, is to make an adequate response to the event, for one can then do something about the storm; and on my own interpretation of Sai.ov this is a round-about way of coming to terms with and doing something about one's own nature, whence the storm- daimon was projected. On this view Homer's transformation of the animistic into the anthropomorphic was an advance, if only because it held the possibility of the further transformation of the anthropo- morphic. But the hylozoists in their sphere had regressed to the animistic level. 23) Such was the price which the daring Milesian intellect paid 22) Aristotle de An. A5, 4IIa 7; Aetius' version (I, 7, II) is 6TO 6ra tvt uXOV pa[ia xal 6ai^ovc ov 'rX^p'E. 23) F. M. Cornford (Greek Religious Thought, p. xxl) puts the matter thus: - "It is perhaps not commonly recognised that, in reducing "the divine" to this impersonal living substance, the philosophers were, without knowing it, reverting to a conception of divinity immensely older than the Homeric anthropomorphism. 230</page><page sequence="15">Aocvco in Homer for abrogating the gods and putting nothing comparable in their place. There is however one small hint that the "transformation of the anthropomorphic" was pursued, with the result that manlike gods were replaced by man himself. It emerges from Heraclitus' well known Fr. I i9, Oo a0p&amp;vOp6ctc, ozcov. As with all else in Heraclitus, this has been variously interpreted. The most recent interpretation known to me is that of Professor Guthrie, "A man's character is the immortal and potentially divine part of him." 24) This would fit well with the meaning I have suggested for aotco4,v, provided that one remembers that the "potentially divine" part of man has its representative in Dionysus as well as in Apollo. In Homer the word aoctov shows its dark side more often than not, and this line of its pedigree should not be ignored. On my interpretation of aiptcov, I should be inclined to restate the fragment as follows: a man's qOoS, that individual cast of behaviour which differentiates him from all others, derives from un- conscious sources. (Here one may recall the sense given to the Platonic Acpl.c v mentioned a little earlier.) This too would be in keeping with the rest of what we know of Heraclitus' thought, for it suggest an intuition, well ahead of its time, parallel to that expressed in his theory of the ?6yo,;- just as the manifest content of the world rests on the hidden foundations of the Xoyo?, so the manifest content of a man's behaviour rests on the unconscious foundations of aoLpcov. The hu- manising of the daimonic, initiated by Homer, here reaches its rightful end, and the projected 80ctzIov has been recalled to its true home in man as part of the total personality. 25) From this viewpoint it is possible to see the successive generations who elaborated and expanded the use of the word aoditov as analogous to a single personality in which originally unconscious contents (as represented by ocifLovLt Ico ) can sometimes reach a conscious maturity (as represented by qOoq 0V6Oprcy aciv[ov); and this, as often happens, without or even in spite of the will of the individual. Such an event They were undoing all the work of the poets and plastic artists, and rediscovering the raw material out of which the humanised gods had been built up." 24) Hist. of Gk. Phil., Vol. I, p. 482. (I am much indebted to Prof. Guthrie for valuable criticisms made while this article was in preparation). 25) Once again, I am not attributing any explicit theory of this sort to Hera- clitus, any more than in a similar case to Homer. It is a question of an intuitive utterance capable of restatement in modern terms. 23I</page><page sequence="16">232 Wilford, AciLov in Homer can happen at any time, though the mode of expressing it will vary with the age. Indeed, this whole enquiry boils down to an examination of different methods of describing the same phenomena, and the sim- plest conclusion would be merely this, that if Homer describes one event in terms of Socdov, and we another in terms of the unconscious, then the two events belong to the same class.</page></plain_text>
