<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXX, Nos. 1-2 (July-October, 1989) 15-34 THE CORE OF THE SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK FOR PRIESTS Louis FINKELSTEIN, Jewish Theological Seminary of America ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to show that the Sifra on Leviticus was originally a textbook used in the Temple to instruct young priests in their duties. This is evident from a number of passages quoted in this study which point to authorship by priests, and some of which are clearly directed to the instruction of young priests. Apparently, it was R. Johanan ben Zakkai, though he himself was not a priest, who mas- tered it, as he mastered the whole halakhic literature. He taught it to his pupil, R. Eliezer, who in turn taught it to R. Akiba. Ultimately, it was edited by R. Judah, the disciple of R. Akiba, who had access to it also from his father, who was a disciple of R. Eliezer. The Sifra1 ON Leviticus, as we have it, was apparently edited by R. Judah toward the end of the second century CE.2 It has undergone changes since that time through the addition of new material by later authorities. R. Judah received it from his father, R. Ilai,3 who was a disciple of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, and from his teacher, R. Akiba.4 All these scholars, however, added their own comments to the editions which they had received. As we study the Sifra that is before us now, we encounter passages which clearly seem to reflect their origin in a work composed by priests and addressed to young priests.5 There are other passages in it to which material has been added which l Prof. Morton Smith was good enough to read this paper in manuscript and he raised some interesting questions, with which I have dealt. This article was written before Prof. Jacob Neusner let me have the proof sheets of his lucid translation of the Sifra. I was able to substitute his translation for mine in several instances. 2 See J. N. Epstein, Mevo'ot le-sifrut ha-tanna'im, pp. 646ff. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 5 In bKet 106a R. Judah, in the name of the amora Samuel, records that the scholars who taught young priests the laws of certain sacrifices received their</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW clearly originated in the rabbinical schools. When we identify these passages we find at their core the original Sifra of the priests. It is my purpose in this paper to identify some of the material which can be shown to have been of priestly origin. 1. Lev 19:29 reads: "Do not degrade your daughter to make her a harlot." On this Sifra remarks: "Lest one think that it is forbidden to give a daughter in marriage to a Levite or an Israelite, Scripture says 'harlot."' It is obvious that this passage was taught by a priest to young priests, for to whom else would it occur that Scripture forbids a father to give his daughter in marriage to a Levite or to an Israelite? The teacher, speaking to the class which consisted of priests, thought that some of them might consider marriage with a nonpriest a profanation. He assured them that this was not so. Apparently there were some priests who disagreed. The Book of Jubilees6 suggests that truly pious people marry their cousins. The Talmud7 has words of praise for one who marries the daugh- ter of his sister. These are perhaps examples of the tradition requiring one to marry within one's social group. 2. In Lev 16:1-2 we read: "And the Lord spoke unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the Lord and died. And the Lord said unto Moses, 'Speak unto Aaron, thy brother, that he come not at all times into the Holy Place within the veil before the ark cover which is upon the ark, that he die not, for I appear in the cloud upon the ark cover.'" Sifra remarks: "'That he die not' is the punishment; 'for I appear in the cloud upon the ark cover' is the warning." It would seem, according to this interpretation, that the Deity ac- wages out of the Temple treasury. This treasury was maintained by the contribu- tions of the Jews all over the world, each one donating half a shekel. The purpose of these gifts was primarily the maintenance of the sacrificial system. Apparently teaching the priests the laws governing the sacrifices was considered to be part of the system and had to be maintained by the Temple treasury. A similar report in the name of R. Judah quoting Samuel is found in pSheq. 6 See Jub 8:6 and 11:8. 7 bYeb 52b. 16</page><page sequence="3">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN tually descended into the Holy of Holies and could be seen there. The view that the Deity has a visible body was widely held in the Judean countryside and by the rich patricians of Jerusalem who associated with the rustics, and above all by the priests, whose notions were similarly those of the villagers.8 Thus Ben Azzai, in disagreeing with his teacher, R. Akiba, said: "The glory of him of whom it is said, 'Behold I fill the heavens and'the earth, says the Lord:' see what his love for Israel has caused him to do-to squeeze himself so as to appear to be speaking from the cover [of the ark]."9 Ben Azzai hailed from a village where Hebrew was still the spoken language long after Aramaic had displaced He- brew in the country at large.10 Accordingly, the authors of this passage in the Sifra interpreted the statement in Leviticus to mean that God actually appeared in the Holy of Holies and could be seen there.11 Scripture was warning the high priest of the peril confronting him when he entered the Holy of Holies, for he might see the Deity. The verse was taken to mean that if he did not take all the precautions mentioned in that chapter he would be in danger of death. The Sadducean high priests who shared this view were natural- ly loath to enter the Holy of Holies unless protected from the divine vision.12 Their reluctance to accept the Pharisaic view that 8See my discussion in The Pharisees: Their Origin and Their Philosophy (Cambridge, MA, 1929), p. 119. 9 See Sifra, nedavah, pereq 3.12, p. 17. 10 See mPar 1.1, where Ben Azzai explains the difference between shelishit and sheloshi. The maid in the house of R. Judah the Patriarch, to whom the scholars turned for the explanation of Hebrew words which were new to them, doubtless came from a similar village where Hebrew was still the spoken language. See also ARN I, chap. 37, p. 55, which apparently derives from a similar background, and which assumes that Hebrew is the language of the angels and that human beings use the same language. " R. Akiba, like the early Pharisees and a thousand years later Maimonides, opposed this anthropomorphism and held that the Deity could not be seen, having no body or physical dimensions. R. Akiba interpreted the verse, "For no man can see me and live" to mean "for no man or other living being can see me," and therefore he interpreted it as saying that even the angels cannot see the Deity. Sifra, nedavah, pereq 3.12, p. 18. 12 For further discussion of this controversy see my "The Oldest Midrash: Pre-Rabbinic Ideals and Teachings in the Passover Haggadah," HTR 31 (1938): 309ff., and The Pharisees, pp. 118ff. and 654ff. 17</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the high priest may follow the specific order of Scripture which required him to put the incense on the fire after he entered the Holy of Holies was primarily due to this fear. They were re- luctant to follow the literal command of Scripture, which re- quired them to take "a panful of glowing coals scooped from the altar before the Lord, and two handfuls of finely ground aromatic incense" and bring them into the space behind the curtains separat- ing the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Temple. According to the Pharisees, this meant that the priest had to carry the panful of glowing coals in one hand and the incense in the other, while he walked from the door of the Temple to the curtain separating the Holy of Holies from the rest of the building, with no one in the room to help him. When the high priest arrived in the Holy of Holies, he placed the censer containing the glowing coals on the rock where in the first Temple the Ark had been placed. He then had to pour the incense on the glowing coals. No wonder that the Talmud describes this ritual as one of the most difficult in the sacrificial system,'3 and no wonder too that the Sadducean high priests were reluctant to perform it. They insisted that the incense be put on the fire outside the Temple. The high priest therefore could thus use both hands to carry the burning incense into the Holy of Holies. Referring to this controversy, Sifra14 remarks: "And he shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord," [meaning] that he must not put the incense on the fire outside the veil and bring it into the holy place. For the Sadducees say that he should put the incense on the fire outside the veil and then bring it in. [They argue that] since this is how one brings incense to a human king, how much more should one do so when bringing incense before the Lord. Furthermore, Scrip- ture says: "For I appear in the cloud upon the ark cover." The sages answered them, "And ye shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord." [This means] that he should not put it on the fire except within the veil. If so, why does Scripture say, "For I appear in the cloud upon the ark cover"? This 13 bYoma49b. 14 Sifra, 'ahare, pereq 3.10, ed. Weiss, p. 81b. 18</page><page sequence="5">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN teaches that he must add incense of the kind which produces smoke. It is obvious on reading these texts that the Sadducees were actually quoting the Sifra in their argument. This can only mean that the Sifra text was already in existence and was a recognized Temple code when the dispute between the Sadducees and the Pharisees took place. The Sadducees, like the commentator in the Sifra quoted above, believed that the "cloud" was a heavenly cloud and argued that the high priest could not enter the Holy of Holies before putting the incense on the fire, lest he should see the cloud with the Deity upon it. The Pharisees replied that the cloud to which Scripture refers was not a heavenly cloud at all but the cloud of smoke rising from the incense as it burned. The priest had therefore nothing to fear when he entered the Holy of Holies. The Divine Presence came only after the priest had put the incense on the fire. And in any case, the Deity could not be seen. 3. From Sifra, hovah, pereq 1.4 we are led to conclude that the authors of the original Sifra flourished while Jerusalem was still a thriving metropolis. Sifra here discusses the question of what is considered labor on the Sabbath, so that, if performed, a sin offering would be required to atone for it. Sifra holds that if one writes two letters which may be read as a complete name, al- though he intended to write a name which began with these two letters, he has violated the Sabbath. It offers the following ex- amples: "One who writes shin mem intending to write Shimcon or Shemu'el, or nun het intending to write Nahor, or dalet nun intending to write Daniel, [he has violated the Sabbath]." This statement must have come from scribes of Jerusalem,'5 who did not distinguish between the final forms of mem and nun and the nonfinal forms of them, since otherwise shin mem and dalet nun could not look like complete names. Indeed, the Babylonian Talmud (Shab 103b) ascribes this statement to R. Judah, who had it from his teachers, presumably going back to tradition in Jerusalem. If so, the text must have come down from a time before the destruction of the Temple and the siege of Jerusalem. 15 See S. Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, p. 23. 19</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 4. There is evidence that the Sifra, beginning as a text of the Temple priests, came into rabbinic literature through the activi- ties of R. Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciple, R. Eliezer.16 Thus we read in Sifra, par. 5.1 on Lev 4:22: "In case it is a chieftain who incurs guilt by doing unwittingly any of the things which by the commandment of the Lord his God ought not to be done," etc. Said R. Yohanan ben Zakkai: Fortunate is the generation whose chieftain brings a sin offer- ing for his unwitting transgression. If the chieftain must bring a sin offering, what need is there to say that an ordinary person must do so? If he brings [a sin offering] for his unwit- ting sin, what need is there to say what he should do to atone for a deliberate transgression?17 The formula "said R. Yohanan ben Zakkai," with the verb pre- ceding the noun and in the past tense, signifies in the Sifra and elsewhere that what follows is an editorial comment. Apparently R. Yohanan ben Zakkai made this comment18 while teaching the Sifra as it was in his day. The passage begins with the word 'asher instead of the usual 'im. R. Yohanan ben Zakkai saw in this use of 'asher, which sounds so much like 'ashre ("fortunate is he who"), a hint for the interpretation which he gave. We know that R. Yohanan, who was the youngest disciple of Hillel,19 made a point of studying all halakhic literature20 and mastered the legal system of the Shammaites as well as that of the Hillelites. In turn, he taught the tradition of the Shammaites to his disciple, R. Eliezer, who was a Shammaite, and the tradition of the Hillelites to his second disciple, R. Joshua, who became the leading Hillelite of his generation.21 Apparently, as part of his study of both traditions, R. Yohanan included the Sifra and taught it to R. Eliezer. That is why the formula, "said R. Eliezer" 16 According to ARN I, chap. 14, p. 29a and ARN II, chap. 28, p. 29a and ARN II, chap. 28, p. 29a. 17 Sifra, hovah, par. 8.1, p. 147. 18 See J. N. Epstein, Mevo'ot le-sifrut ha-tannaim, p. 460. 19 Ibid. 20 Ibid. 21 The Talmud records hundreds of controversies between R. Eliezer and R. Joshua. In all of these it is clear that R. Eliezer voices the views of the Shammaites and R. Joshua the views of the Hillelites. 20</page><page sequence="7">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN (again, with the verb in the past tense preceding the noun) occurs several times in the Sifra. In each case R. Eliezer is not voicing an independent opinion but rather making an editorial comment.22 Again, Lev 5:1 reads: "If a person incurs guilt having heard an imprecation, and if, although he is able to testify as one who has either seen or learned of the matter, he does not give information, he is subject to punishment." On this verse, Sifra, hovah, par. 8.8 makes the following comment: And whence do we know that Scripture is speaking only of a money claim? Said R. Eliezer: Scripture here says 'or, or, or' (Lev 5:1). Similarly, Scripture says 'or, or, or' in the passage dealing with a bailment23 (Lev 5:20ff.). Just as the repetition of or in the passage dealing with a deposit concerns only a suit for money, so the repetition of or here, [that is, in regard to the testimony], deals only with a suit for money. [The objec- tion now is raised] that the repetition of or occurs also in regard to the law of murder (Num 35:21ff.). Just as the repeti- tion of or in the case of the law of murder does not concern a suit for money, [so the repetition of or in regard to the law of evidence need not concern a suit for money. The answer is given:] We infer the meaning of the repetition of or in a matter which involves an oath from the repetition of or in a similar matter which involves an oath, and we cannot use the repeti- tion of or in a passage dealing with the law of murder where no oath is involved. [A second objection is raised:] The word or is repeated also in regard to the law of the wife suspected of adultery (Num 5:14ff.). Just as there the repetition of the word or does not involve a money matter, so the repetition of or in regard to testimony should not necessarily involve a money 22 Cf. J. N. Epstein, Mevo'ot le-sifrut ha-tannaim, p. 127, where he discusses the editorial comment of R. Yose at the end of Mishnah Kelim. R. Yose's com- ment is quoted in exactly the same form as the editorial comments of R. Yohanan ben Zakkai and R. Eliezer. 23 This method of interpretation is called gezerah shawah, namely, the assump- tion that if Scripture uses the same word in two different contexts, there must be a close relationship between the subjects treated. R. Eliezer assumed that the use of the word or several times in both contexts meant that the testimony discussed was related to the subject which concerns the deposit of money. This view, shared by all rabbinic scholars quoted in the Talmud, was opposed by a number of scholars whose views are preserved in the Targumim. 21</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW matter. [The answer to this objection is] that we can interpret the repetition of the word or in a case involving an oath, where no priest is involved, from a similar passage containing the repetition of or when no priest is involved. We cannot use the repetition of the word or in the case of the law of murder, where no oath is involved, and we cannot use the repetition of the word or in regard to the wife suspected of adultery, where, although an oath is involved, a priest is also involved. R. Eliezer's statement is followed in the next pereq by the explanation of R. Jose the Galilean, who says: Scripture reads: "If a person incurs guilt having heard an imprecation, and if, although he is able to testify as one who has either seen or learned of the matter, he does not give information, he is subject to punishment." Scripture says, "has either seen or learned of the matter." This passage deals only with testimony which can be estab- lished by learning without seeing or by seeing without learn- ing. What is such a matter? A money claim. R. Akiba says: Scripture (Lev 5:5) says "in any of these matters," meaning in the case of some matters he is required to bring a sacrifice, and in other matters he is not. In matters involving money suits he is required to bring a sacrifice; in other matters he is not. The remark of R. Eliezer is introduced with the words, "Said R. Eliezer," in the past tense. The remarks of R. Jose the Galilean and R. Akiba are introduced, respectively, with "R. Jose the Galilean says" and "R. Akiba says," in the present tense. This difference suggests that R. Eliezer made his comments as editor of an early edition of the Sifra when he taught it. R. Jose the Galilean and R. Akiba use the form natural for one who disa- greed with a previous statement, in this case that of R. Eliezer. In other words, R. Eliezer was editing the old text and trying to prove through his analogy that the subject under consideration was only testimony involved in money matters. R. Jose the Gali- lean and R. Akiba took issue with him. It follows that we have here three stages in the development of the Sifra. The first, preceding the comment of R. Eliezer, was the text of Sifra used by priests in the Temple. R. Eliezer added his 22</page><page sequence="9">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN editorial comments. R. Jose the Galilean and R. Akiba added their views in opposition to R. Eliezer. 5. R. Eliezer is quoted also as making an editorial remark in connection with Lev 5:15. There we read: "When a person com- mits a trespass, being unwittingly remiss about any of the Lord's sacred things, he shall bring as his penalty to the Lord a ram without blemish," etc. Sifra24 remarks: "Unwittingly"-this excludes the willful transgressor. Is this not obvious? Willful violation of other commandments is sub- ject to the punishment of being rooted out. Nevertheless, the [willful] transgressor is not required to bring a sacrifice. Cer- tainly, then, misuse of sacred objects, for which the willful transgressor is free from the punishment of being rooted out, does not involve the obligation to bring a sacrifice. No. [One can argue] that the punishment for the violation of other commandments does not involve the penalty of [natural] death. [That is why the willful transgressor is free from the obligation to offer a sacrifice]. Can you argue from this that violation of sacred objects, which is subject to the punishment of [natural] death, should be free from offering a sacrifice? That is why Scripture says "unwittingly," [to exclude the willful transgres- sor from the obligation to offer a sacrifice]. Said R. Eliezer: A sin offering is required for a sin, and a guilt offering is required for a sin.25 Just as a sin offering is not required for willful transgression, so this one [i.e., the guilt offering], should not be required for willful transgression. Or shall we argue in the following way: Just as other guilt offer- ings must be brought for willful transgression as well as for unwitting transgression, so this guilt offering should be brought for willful transgression as well as for an unwitting one. R. Eliezer's remark is an editorial comment explaining the view given in the passage of Sifra under discussion. The text included the argument mentioned anonymously, but he thought that he could clarify the issue with his statement. In other words, the 24 Sifra, hovah, par. 11.8, p. 197. 25 R. Eliezer generally applies to the guilt offering (lWV) the rules which all other scholars apply only to the sin offering (nKun). See mZeb 1.1. 23</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW beginning of this baraita was part of a text which R. Eliezer learned from his teachers and which he felt needed clarification. R. Yohanan ben Zakkai was the most distinguished scholar of the generation which witnessed the destruction of the Temple. R. Eliezer was a mature scholar at the time of that catastrophe. Since the comments of each of them imply the existence of the Sifra as a text, we must conclude that it was composed during the Temple period for obvious use by teachers of priests. 6. While R. Tarfon and R. Akiba belonged to the generation after the destruction of the Temple, the fact that they seem to have studied the Sifra together suggests further that it was a recognized Temple text which they helped introduce into rabbinic literature. That they did study the book together is evident from several passages in Sifra itself which were apparently added to the ancient text by their disciples. One of these passages deals with Lev 1.5. The passage reads: "The bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall bring near the blood," etc. Sifra26 remarks: "Shall bring near"-this refers to taking the blood [from the animal]. Lest you think that the verse refers to the dashing of the blood, Scripture says later on, "And they shall dash the blood, dashing it against all sides of the altar." So the word we-hiqrivu can only mean receiving the blood, [and this] re- quires a qualified priest and a holy vessel. R. Akiba said: Whence do we know that receiving the blood must be done by a qualified priest clad in holy garments? From the fact that Scripture speaks here of priests, and Num 3:3 reads, "Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests who were ordained for the priesthood." Just as in that verse "priest" means a qualified priest clad in priestly garments, so here "priest" means a qualified priest clad in priestly garments. R. Tarfon said to him: How long will you continue to collect verses and quote them at us? May I lose my children27 if I do not have a tradition that there is a difference between the ritual of receiving the blood and that of dashing it, but I cannot explain it. 26 Sifra, nedavah, par. 4.4, p. 37. 27 R. Tarfon was accustomed to swear by the lives of his children (cf. Sifre Num 75, p. 70; tZeb 1.8, p. 480; bZeb 13a). 24</page><page sequence="11">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN R. Akiba said to him: Will you permit me to repeat before you something that you taught me?28 R. Tarfon replied: Speak. R. Akiba said: In regard to the ritual of receiving the blood, planning to do so [at the wrong time] does not have the same status as actually doing so at the wrong time; one who receives the blood outside the proper place commits no sin. One who dashes the blood outside the proper place commits a trans- gression. If defiled people receive the blood, they commit no sin. If they dash the blood, they commit a transgression. R. Tarfon said to him: May I lose my children if it is not true that you did not turn either right or left from the tradition. It is I who heard the tradition, and I could not explain it, but you interpret Scripture and support the tradition. Anyone who leaves you is as though he has left life. 7. Sifra, nedavah, par. 8.7: Immediately after the discussion of various kinds of offerings which one may offer to the Temple, we read the following: Whence do we know that a private individual may offer a gift of oil? From the same argument and from the same response. Because Scripture says "his offering." This is the view of R. Tarfon. R. Tarfon said: Just as we find that wine can be an obligatory offering and may also be a voluntary offering, so also oil, which can sometimes be an obligatory offering, can also be a voluntary offering. R. Akiba answered him: No. Wine can be given as an obligatory offering by itself, but oil cannot be given as an obligatory offering by itself. [Therefore, it does not follow that oil can be a voluntary offering.] 8. Lev 5:17-18 reads: "And when a person, without knowing it, sins in regard to any of the Lord's commandments about things which are not to be done, and then realizes his guilt, he shall be subject to punishment. He shall bring to the priest a ram," etc. This passage was interpreted as referring to the guilt offering of a person who feared that he had committed a transgression but was not sure. Accordingly, he was required to sacrifice a ram.29 The 28 This was a favorite expression of R. Akiba when he spoke to his teachers. He did not mean that he had necessarily learned this passage from his teacher. 29 He also had to reimburse the Temple for the value of any use he had made of the holy object, but that payment did not have to be made unless he was 25</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW passage follows immediately on the one dealing with the unwit- ting use of holy objects for secular purposes. R. Akiba remarks: "These two passages are placed together in order to show that the law requiring the sacrifice of a ram, if one thinks that he may have committed a transgression, applies also to the transgres- sion of the misuse of holy objects." To this R. Tarfon replies in Sifra: Why should this person be required to bring two guilt offer- ings? [One, because he did not know whether he had com- mitted a trespass or not; and the second, when he found that he had committed the trespass.] Rather, [continued R. Tarfon], he should bring only one guilt offering worth two selacs and should say, "If I have trespassed by the misuse of holy objects, this is my payment and this is my guilt offering. If, however, the matter remains in doubt, the money for the possible tres- pass is a gift to the Temple, and the ram is a guilt offering for a possible trespass." R. Akiba replied: You are right so far as this concerns a trespass involving the use of sacred objects with little profit. But what of a person who had used a sacred object requiring the payment of one hundred minas? Would it not be better for the violator to offer a ram worth two selacs rather than to make a payment of one hundred minas? This dialogue, like the others between R. Akiba and R. Tarfon, was apparently added to the Sifra by their disciples, and it seems altogether probable that this occurred as they were studying the book. 9. In one passage Sifra quotes R. Ishmael as insisting that a rule which according to Sifra is based on a superfluous word in the biblical text can be derived by sheer logic. R. Akiba refuted R. Ishmael's remarks. From this passage it is clear that R. Akiba and R. Ishmael knew the Sifra, which R. Akiba apparently learned from his teacher, R. Eliezer. Lev 1.2 reads: "Speak to the Israelite people and say to them: When any of you presents an offering of cattle to the Lord," etc. On this Sifra30 remarks: certain that he had actually made use of the Temple property. Hence R. Akiba's suggestion that if the value of the use which he had made of the Temple object was very high, R. Tarfon would require him to make a heavy payment. 30 Sifra, nedavah, par. 3.7, p. 22. 26</page><page sequence="13">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN "Of cattle:" this excludes an animal, either male or female, which has been used for sexual relations with a human being. Sifra continues: But is not this obvious? If a blemished animal which is not involved in any transgression is unfit for the altar, how much more so is an animal which was used for sexual relations with a human being unfit for the altar. [No.] An animal used to plough together with an ass which is then used for a trans- gression is nevertheless fit for the altar. No. Although it is true that an animal which has ploughed with an ass may be offered on the altar, this is so because it does not have to be put to death, whereas an animal which has been used for unnatural sexual relations must be destroyed. Sifra continues: Take what you have brought. What you say applies only to an animal that has been used for unnatural sexual relations in the presence of two witnesses. But how will you prove that an animal which has been used for unnatural sexual relations in the presence of only one witness or in the presence of its owner is unfit for the altar? R. Ishmael replied: I will argue as follows: an animal with a blemish is not made unfit for house- hold use even'if two witnesses testify to the blemish, yet only one witness to the blemish makes the animal unfit for the altar. How much more so, then, is an animal unfit for the altar which has been used for sexual relations and therefore must be put to death if there are two witnesses against it. R. Akiba said: No. An animal with a blemish cannot be sacrificed on the altar because the blemish is visible [to all]. How can you argue from this that an animal which has been used for sexual relations cannot be sacrificed on the altar, since the matter is not obvious to everyone? It is apparent that the comments of R. Ishmael and R. Akiba were made as they studied the older Sifra. It follows that they, like R. Tarfon and R. Eliezer, had a text of Sifra which had been used in earlier generations to teach young priests. 10. The evidence thus far adduced seems to establish only that the core of the Sifra existed while the Temple was still intact. 27</page><page sequence="14">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW However, some passages seem to indicate that the Sifra was already used as a textbook in the Temple at a much earlier time. Some parts of it seem to reflect the struggle between the Hellenists and the observant Jews before the age of the Maccabees. Thus Lev 4:25 reads: "If any person from among the populace un- wittingly incurs guilt," etc. Sifra remarks on this passage: "'The populace'-this excludes the chieftain. 'From among the popu- lace'-this excludes the anointed high priest.31 'From among the populace'-this excludes the Hellenists."32 It is clear that the authorities who interpreted the words "from among the populace" to exclude the chieftain and the anointed high priest did not interpret these words to exclude the meshum- mad. When the Hellenistic movement arose, the Sifra had proba- bly already included the interpretation which excluded the chief- tain and the anointed high priest. If so, the whole context must be pre-Maccabean. In their zeal to prevent the Hellenists from offering sacrifices, the editors of the Sifra of the day found support in the words "from among the populace." 11. On the verse Lev 1:2, "Speak to the Israelite people and say to them, 'When any of you presents an offering of cattle unto 31 It is one of the rules of interpretation regularly followed by the Sifra that the word In (meaning 'from') implies that only a part of the object mentioned in the noun which follows it is subject to the particular rule being announced. So here the fact that Scripture says "of the populace" means that some people are not included in the rule. The early Sifra takes it that this means that the rule does not apply to the high priest. 32 The word T?tWV as used in the Sifra means "Hellenist." See S. Lieberman, "Redifat dat Yisrael," in Sefer ha-yovel le-kavod Shalom Baron, eds., S. Lieber- man and A. Hyman (Jerusalem, 1975), p. 229, n. 106. nTOvt meant 'rooting out,' as Antiochus IV tried to do. A 'TI7WtO was originally a person who yielded to the pressure. During the Hadrianic persecution there was at first no attempt to suppress the Jewish religion as such. There were prohibitions against circumcision and reciting the Shema'. However, it turned out that Jews were prevented from observing any of the commandments. That the root IT=t was first used during the Hellenistic period and was applied to the Hellenists seems evident from the passage quoted by Prof. Lieberman, as well as from tSuk 4.2, ed. Lieberman, 2:278, where we are told that Miriam, of the clan Bilga, became a nrnln?wT and married a Greek soldier. She spoke contemptuously of the altar, and the whole clan was penalized because of her. See also Midrash Psalms 82, 11.7, where Alcimus the high priest is described as a Hellenist, and the word used for this purpose is that he became a 'T1W;V. 28</page><page sequence="15">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN the Lord,"' Sifra33 remarks: "'Any' [literally 'a person']-this includes the proselytes; 'of you'-this excludes the meshumma- dim." The relation of this passage to the one discussed above is obvious. When the Hellenistic movement arose, the transmitters of the Sifra as it then existed sought and found support in Scripture for their view that a Hellenist could not offer a sacrifice in the Temple. 12. That the core of the Sifra existed in Hellenistic times is also evident from Sifra, hobah, par. 4, which deals with the rules governing a sin offering for the community. According to Sifra, hobah, par. 4.2, this sin offering was to be sanctified only if the Court of the Chamber of Hewn Stones mistakenly gave a wrong decision and the majority of the people followed it. The Court of the Chamber of Hewn Stones consisted of members of dis- tinguished families, particularly priests and their aristocratic associates. Sifra, hovah, par. 4.4, says, as does the parallel passage in the Mishnah:34 "If the mufla'35 of the court is not present when the vote is taken, or if one of the members of the court says that he did not know the answer to a question, or if he says to the others, 'You are mistaken,' [the decision of the court is void]." The parallel passage in the Tosefta36 says that if any member of the court is absent, the decision is void. This strange provision leads to the paradox that a person could be convicted of a capital crime by a vote of two more than half the number of members of the court, but it would take a unanimous decision to determine whether something was pure or impure, permissible to eat or not. This curious provision certainly requires explanation. Sifra37 says further: "If one of the members of the court is a proselyte, or a mamzer, or a natin, or an elderly person who has no children," their decisions are null and void. Anyone who has 33 Sifra, nedavah, par. 2.3, p. 20. 34 mHor 1.5. 35 See my discussion of the position of the mufla' and the reason for his existence in "'Od 'al mufla' she-be-bet din," in 'Iyyunim be-sifrut hazal be- miqra' ve-toldot Yisrael muqdash le-'Ezra Sion Melamed, ed., Y.

Sifra, hovah, par. 4.7 says further that the sin offering of the community is required only if the court has issued a decision contrary to some aspect of the law not specifically stated in Scripture. If they have issued a decision contrary to the express statement of Scripture, no sin offering could be sacrificed. The reason for this is that such a wrong decision should not have misled the people, and therefore those who followed it could not be said to have acted unintentionally. To understand fully the background of these curious rules we must consider conditions in Judea early in the second century BCE, before the time of the Maccabees. In the year 200 BCE, Antiochus III, king of Syria, defeated Ptolemy and seized Pales- tine. In this endeavor he was helped by the Judean militia under the leadership of the high priest Simeon the Righteous. In grati- tude for this assistance, Antiochus III proclaimed Jewish law as the law of the land for Jews, to be enforced by the civil government. Obviously this declaration did not come from Antiochus III without preliminary negotiations. In these negotiations a diffi- culty must have arisen, for there were two systems of Jewish law. One was the system advocated by the high priests of the house of Zadok and their associates. A different system was advocated by the lay scholars of Jerusalem, who claimed to have oral traditions of their own going back to Moses. Their leaders were organized as the Great Synagogue. It was apparently the genius of Simeon the Righteous that prevailed and brought about a unified approach which, when presented to Antiochus III, led to his proclamation. This unity was achieved through a compromise between the high priesthood and the scholars of the Great Synagogue. In this compromise the scholars recognized the authority of the high priest and of the Court of the Chamber of Hewn Stones, of which the high priest was the head. On the other hand, the high priest and his associates recognized the validity of some traditions which the lay scholars claimed to have inherited from the prophets and ultimately from Moses. However, the high priest and his followers reserved the right to adhere to most of their own traditions. 30</page><page sequence="17">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN Thus, from the beginning, the Pharisees consisted of two groups with different religious practices.38 Ultimately the patrician group, consisting largely of provincials and aristocrats of Jerusalem who had large provincial estates, as well as of many priests who were associated with them, became a faction of the Pharisees. The urban traders of Jerusalem and the small farmers of the Judean highland became organized as the second group. Each group had as its head a recognized authority. Both groups together seem to have formed a Pharisaic association after the manner of the Phoenician and Greek trade associations. Like those commercial associations, the Pharisaic association was headed by a man called nasi', or president. Each member was called haver, that is, 'member.' While the two groups adhered to different practices in hundreds of matters, they were able to be intimately associated with each other-their members dined in each other's house, trusted each other in regard to the observance of the laws of purity and tithes, and despite their differences in regard to the marriage law, intermarried with each other. The members could trust each other to warn them if any marriage was forbidden by one's own tradition. This accounts for the existence of two kinds of Pharisees, which ultimately came to be known as the Houses of Shammai and Hillel. To make sure that the Court of the Chamber of Hewn Stones never issued a decision which was against their tradition, the lay scholars made it a rule that at least one of their members, usually the nasi', must also be a member of the Chamber of Hewn Stones. He was called mufla', correspond- ing to the functionary in Greek courts who was a scholar who set down the law for the court to apply. They made a further rule that if any judge was absent, or said that he did not know the law (that is, was undecided), or said to the other judges "You are mistaken," the court could take no action. The requirement of unanimity among the judges in ritual questions39 guaranteed that the traditions of the lay scholars of Jerusalem would never be violated. This accounts for the rule requiring unanimity of the judges in ritual decisions. 38 See Prof. Louis Ginzberg in his book On Jewish Law and Lore, (Phila- delphia, 1955), pp. 77ff., where he demonstrates that five pairs of scholars who followed Simeon the Righteous consisted of representatives of each group. 39 Sifra, hovah, par. 4.3, p. 141. 31</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The rule that if a person not qualified to be a judge, such as a proselyte or a mamzer, is appointed to the court, its decisions are invalid, points to the time when Jason, the brother of Onias the high priest, seized the high priesthood and persuaded Antio- chus IV to nullify the special status given Jewish law by his father, Antiochus III. When Jason took over the high priesthood he doubtless reorganized the Court of the Chamber of Hewn Stones, filling its membership with Hellenists who agreed with him. The Sifra and the corresponding passage in the Mishnah reflect the reaction of the pietist scholars of the Temple to this action. Moreover, it was conceivable that this restructured court of Jason would issue decisions contrary to the commands of Scripture. The view in Sifra is that such action was of course invalid. If the decision involved only a detail of the law which was not clearly expressed in Scripture, the community that fol- lowed it could be said to have acted unwittingly and therefore could expiate their sin through a sacrifice. However, if the deci- sion was contrary to the word of Scripture one had to assume that those who followed it knew that it was wrong and were deliberate transgressors. Therefore no sacrifice could be offered. If this analysis is correct, obviously this section of the Sifra was added during the high priesthood of Jason, about 175 BCE. 13. Lev 14:1 reads, "The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 'This shall be the ritual for a leper at the time that he is to be cleansed."' On this verse, Sifra remarks: "'This shall be the ritual for a leper,' i.e., in the Temple. 'This'-it cannot be performed in a high place; 'shall be'-the ritual applies to this time [when the Temple was destroyed]." The phrase "this shall be the ritual" is interpreted on several other occasions in the same way, limiting what is prescribed for the Temple in Jerusalem.40 However, elsewhere the words "shall be" are not found, and therefore the ritual could not be performed after the destruction of the Temple. It is obvious that the passage interpreting "shall be" as referring to the time after the destruction of the Temple was added after 70 CE, when there was no longer a Temple. It is more unlikely that a teacher would make a pro- vision for the performance of a ritual without the Temple while it 40 Sifra, zaw, par. 2.1, ed. Weiss, p. 30c; par. 31, p. 32a; par. 4.1, p. 33c. 32</page><page sequence="19">SIFRA: A TEMPLE TEXTBOOK-FINKELSTEIN existed. However, the rest of the passage was surely taught to the priests in the Temple, as were the passages dealing with the sin offering, the guilt offering, and the meal offering. 14. Lev 19:20 reads, "If a man has carnal relations with a woman who is a slave and has been designated for another man, but so far as redemption is concerned has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there shall be an indemnity." Sifra41 remarks on this passage: Lest you think that Scripture refers to a Canaanite slave, it says "but so far as redemption is concerned." Lest you think that a fully redeemed slave [is under discussion], Scripture says "she was not redeemed." How is this [to be understood]? Re- deemed and not redeemed, she is half slave and half free. Scripture speaks here of a woman betrothed (nrT?&lt;n32) to a free man-that is the view of R. Akiba. R. Ishmael said: Scripture discusses a Canaanite slave who is betrothed to a free man. R. Eleazar ben Azariah says: All forbidden marriages were discussed. There remains only the woman who is half slave and half free. 15. Finally, we read in Sifra, 'Emor, par. 2.1: "The priest who is the highest of his brethren [on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been ordained to wear the vest- ments . . . ]-should be highest among his brethren in beauty, in wealth, in strength, in wisdom, and appearance. If he has no [wealth] his brethren, the priests, should provide it." It is hard to conceive of any of the rabbinic sages as the author of this passage which makes wealth and physical strength a test for the high priesthood and makes no mention of piety or knowledge of the Torah. It seems clear that this passage originated among the Temple priests who indeed held that the high priest ought to be a member of the wealthy families. In R. Akiba's remark the word bi-me~oreset is extraordinary, for at the beginning of his remarks he had argued that Scripture was discussing a woman half slave and half free. What one would 41 Sifra, qedoshim, pereq 5.2, ed. Weiss, p. 89c. 33</page><page sequence="20">34 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW expect after that is ha-me'oreset, that is, a woman who is half slave and half free and is betrothed to a free man. The use of the preposition bi in bi-me'oreset instead of the article ha is extra- ordinary. Yet it is found in all texts of the Sifra and in the parallel passage in the Jerusalem Talmud. This suggests that R. Akiba had before him an older text which remarked simply that Scripture was discussing a slave who was betrothed to a free man. Since she was betrothed to him, he obviously had paid at least part of the bride money for her, and to that extent she was free. The original text did not argue, as R. Akiba does, that she was half slave and half free, because that was obvious. We therefore have before us a statement of R. Akiba which offers a new argument in favor of the view that this slave was partially free. However, he did not change the text before him and con- tinued to read bi-me'oreset.</page></plain_text>
