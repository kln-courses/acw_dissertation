<plain_text><page sequence="1">Siddur Va'ani Tefillati Rabbinical Assembly of Israel, Jerusalem, 1 998 reviewed by Naomi Graetz I am writing this review from a dual perspective, as a feminist and as an active user of the new Siddur (prayer book) Va* ani Tefillati1 in the Masorti (Conservative) congregation of Kehillat Magen Avraham in Omer, Israel. To complicate issues, I am also married to the chairperson of the committee that formulated the siddur, Rabbi Michael Graetz. Over the years I have been party to the birthing process of this endeavor, and I am aware of the frustrations and joy that go into putting together such a work. Although I have been privy to the process, I will relate primarily to the product, to which I and any other user have access on a daily basis. Jewish feminists often ask three crucial questions in approaching the prayer book: "Can a traditional liturgy, created exclusively by men and replete with masculine imagery for God, express the religious sensibilities of women?" The answer seems to be: only partially. "How can Jews incorporate women into a tradition that has marginalized them?" I think Va* ani Tefillati is trying hard to do this. "What are the limits of the ongoing reinterpretation of classical Jewish texts that are at the heart of the perpetuation of Judaism?"2 It seems to be that there is no need yet to discuss limits, since we are still in the stages of process, of the ongoing reinterpretation that is what Va* ani Tefillati is all about. Having given my short answers to these questions, I will proceed to elaborate on them in the following pages. What's in a Name? The name of the siddur, Va*ani Tefillati, is based on Psalms 69:14: "And I, my prayer unto You, O Lord - let it be at an acceptable time." The Talmud (Berakhot 7b) asks and responds: "What is an acceptable time? - when the congregation worships." However, the intention in choosing this title is Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women 's Studies and Gender Issues, no. 2. © 1999 by Nashim. 161</page><page sequence="2">Naomi Graetz also to emphasize the uanF (I), the person praying. In the words of the editor, Rabbi Simha Roth, "I am my prayer; my prayer and I are one. I do not say one thing while meaning another." Thus, one of the stated purposes of this siddur is to take into account the needs of the individual, the "0/1/," as well as those of the community, the tzibbur. Who is the "ani* reviewing the sidduft I, along with other liberal Masorti Jews with strong feminist inclinations, have a problem relating to anthropomorphic descriptions of God, supernaturalism, hierarchy, the issue of the chosen people, gender inequalities, class discrimination and animal sacrifice. Being aware of Marcia Falk's Book of Blessings and other feminist prayer texts and their solutions to many of these problematic issues complicates my uneasiness with traditional prayer.3 Process: On-Going Relationships Va* ani Tefillati belongs to a Conservative theology that views humankind and God as partners. Its philosophy is that there must be a constant give and take for the relationship to remain valid, not stuck in the old roles. In view of both the history of Jewish liturgy and the halakhic sources, neither the committee chairperson nor the editor saw halakhic difficulties in composing new hymns to be added into the existing prayers, or in making "incidental" changes to the traditional text. In this context, Roth quotes from the collected responsa of former Israel Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who writes that "the order of service of each tribe must be appropriate to the ethos of its soul."4 The stated audience for this siddur is an Israeli, Hebrew-speaking public in general, and worshipers in the congregations of the Masorti movement in particular - a public quite varied in its opinions. The siddur committee thus had a mandate to create a siddur whose character would be Masorti, Israeli-Zionist, pluralistic and innovative.5 Furthermore, Graetz stresses in his preface that "the texts of the prayers must clearly express the role of women in Jewish history and the contribution of our mothers to the faith and to the spirituality of Israel. ... Masorti Judaism ... strives to attain an attitude of equality for women in all that is connected with their status in Judaism." These multiple goals inevitably compete with one another. Further 162</page><page sequence="3">Siddur Va'ani Tefillati tension is added by the proud commitment of the Conservative movement both to preserving the tradition and to adjustment and change.6 The siddur was a product of consensus after intense debate, not only within the committee of the Israeli Rabbinical Assembly but also within an advisory committee drawn from all parts of the Masorti movement, including the youth movement. Any product that is worked over by a committee reflects compromise among different viewpoints, and will be hard-pressed to be consistent with a groundbreaking ideology like feminism.7 I would like to look at some of the accomplishments of Va'ani Tefillati and see whether, for a feminist Jew, it passes the test. a. A Conservative/Masorti Siddur It is fitting that in a siddur that is a product of the Conservative movement, one finds emendations, annotations and commentary that reflect critical scholarship and try hard not to offend modern sensibilities. These characteristics make of Va'ani Tefillati not only a book that can be used for prayer, but a sourcebook for study about prayer and all of the mitzvot connected with it. This is especially important to women, who may be unfamiliar with the service because they have been denied the opportunity to learn about prayer. Va'ani Tefillati also serves as a "primer" of Masorti theology and Weltanschauung. For instance, the introduction to the Musaf service explains clearly and succinctly the theological and religious positions of the Masorti movement on the question of temple worship. b. An Israeli-Zionist Siddur The siddur is intended not only for a Masorti audience, but for a Hebrew- speaking Israeli audience in general. Though the average Israeli reads Hebrew, s/he is often illiterate when it comes to the language of prayer, with its "complicated sentences ... with their accumulation of adjectives and verbs," as Roth puts it. The siddur therefore tries very hard to be "user friendly." For instance, passages recited in the liturgy only on certain occasions, such as the additions for the Ten Days of Penitence, are set off by being printed both in italics (somewhat inappropriately in a Hebrew 163</page><page sequence="4">Naomi Graetz context) and in a different color. Va* ani Tefìllati has many textbook qualities: clear graphics; symbols that are explained; alternative readings; guides to the physical practice of Jewish prayer; and most of all explanations that take the "lack of comfort" factor of most Israeli worshipers into account. Again, this may be important to women who have been made to feel unwelcome or irrelevant in the "normal" Israeli synagogue. As for the Zionist aspect of the siddur, if we look at the Grace after Meals (Birkat Hamazon), we find that it includes a blessing for soldiers (in the masculine)8 and for the State of Israel. A new paragraph, to be added to the Grace and to the daily prayers, has been composed for Israel's Independence Day, on which the complete festive Hallel is to be recited. A whole section is devoted to rituals, special prayers and commemorative days connected with the land and the State of Israel. Moreover, Roth changes a single letter of one word in the Grace - "and lead us upright in our own land" (and not "to our own land") - to make of it "a plea for the values of uprightness, equity and pride in the public life of the Jewish state." c. An Innovative, Pluralistic Siddur When we look at the table of contents, the siddur appears to be following the traditional order. However, one major section, Beshivtekha beveitekha ("When you are in your home"), an expansion of the usual section of everyday blessings, breaks the traditional order of the prayers. It is divided into four sections: Holy Days, Blessings, Beheik hamishpaha "(in the bosom of the family"), and Belekhtekha vaderekh ("When you go on your way"). While this placement may make the kiddush and zemirot for Shabbat harder to find for those who are accustomed to their traditional location, it is clear that a statement is being made: this siddur is not meant to be used only in the synagogue. Religious activity deserves a central place in the home. In many places in Va' ani tefillati, commentary takes the place occupied in bilingual prayer books by the omission or revision of problematic passages in the translation In others, the problematic passages themselves have been revised or alternative versions are offered, either on the page itself or 164</page><page sequence="5">Siddur Va'ani Tefillati in the Eilu ve-eilu section near the end of the book. Thus, many of the passages that relate to animal sacrifice have been replaced with passages reflecting more humanist concerns. In the popular hymn Ein keloheinu, the last line, which speaks of the incense offered in the Temple, has been replaced by a phrase from Psalms 102. A much more radical innovation appears in the MusaJ prayers for Shabbat and festivals, where the user- friendly directions allow me to skip the sacrificial menu of "lamb and kuskus" Instead, those of us who so choose can say prayers composed of phrases from the prophets calling for peace, universal knowledge of God and "sacrifices" of words rather than animals. In the festival Musaf, we are offered the option of omitting the phrase "because of our sins we were exiled from our land." Though the rationale given for this omission is the phrase's inappropriateness to those of us who live here, I have always been theologically uncomfortable with its "sin-leads-to-punishment" formula. An alternative version of Aleinu softens the particularistic quality of Israel's chosenness. The line "He did not make us like the other nations" is replaced with a verse appearing in Reconstructionist prayer books, "who gave us teachings of truth and planted eternal life within us." Although I am happy that I can choose to say this, it would have been more "user friendly" here if the line had been printed, even in brackets, where the prayer appears in the regular service. I find it annoying to have to turn to the end of the siddur each time, and the placement of this version in the Eilu ve-eilu section is a statement in itself. An Inclusive Siddur The siddur has taken the direction of including women and of recognizing their contributions to Jewish life and history, but it has done so in a manner that clearly expresses the dispute around this position and the compromises that were made. For example, the word ve-imoteinu ("and our foremothers"), wherever it appears next to avoteinu in the obligatory prayers (and it does not always appear), is placed in brackets, making it evident that this is merely an optional alternative to the male norm. Part of the problem, of course, has to do with the gendered nature of the Hebrew language. The traditional language of the siddur, which Va'ani tefillati attempts as far as possible to retain, uses masculine forms, and 165</page><page sequence="6">Naomi Graetz whether these can or should be taken to include women is moot. Roth is convinced that "the expression avoteinu ['our ancestors' or 'our fathers'] includes the foremothers," but adds that in order to placate those "many people [who] prefer to give more salient expression to this view ... wherever the avot are mentioned I have added (in square brackets) the imahot Those who wish to will include them; those who do not will omit them." For many of us, this amounts to a bone thrown to the starving.9 Ironically, these same decisions are cited by some Masorti rabbis as a reason for refusing to allow prayer leaders to use this siddur in their services. Because of its variances with the traditional language, they feel that the siddur is not halakhically acceptable as a vehicle to fulfill the mitzvah of prayer. The inclusion of women in religious life, on the other hand, is much less in dispute, as exemplified by the ceremony for the birth of a daughter (Zeved habat), the assignment of significant roles to women in the circumcision ceremony, the revision of the customary prayer for rain to mention both forefathers and foremothers, and the equivalent prayers for benot and benei mitzvah. The picture used to show the correct placement of the head phylactery is of a woman.10 And despite the controversy about the insertion of imahot in the central Amida prayer, the imahot are inserted before the avot in the Grace after Meals. Despite these very important efforts to include women more thoroughly in the siddur, I found it very disturbing to discover in the daily Amida bl newly created passage for Yom hashoah (the Memorial Day for the Holocaust) in which no attempt at inclusivity is made.11 Thus, we read "our fathers" (no imoteinu this time) and Zaken ve-na'ar ("old and young," in the masculine). This, despite the overly rich biblical metaphors available to the writer of this new prayer depicting the punishment of Female Israel by God. On the other hand, the very moving Seder Yom Hashoah included elsewhere in the siddur relates to women's experiences as well. God-Language As we have seen, the ideology of the Va* ani tefillati is egalitarian with regard to religious practice. As is becoming increasingly clear today, the problem with this, and with the siddur, is that egalitarianism does not necessarily take into account women's needs. Women are "allowed" to be 166</page><page sequence="7">Siddur Va'ani Tefillati equal to men provided that they (we) follow their rules. Because we want to come aboard, we allow our voices to be silenced and agree not to rock the boat too much. Cosmetic changes such as adding the names of the Matriarchs are tolerated, as long as we don't look too closely at the metaphors for the Godhead. It is serious to me, as a feminist, that the God-language of the siddur is exclusively male, that God is addressed only in the masculine, and that the prayers often reflect male perspectives masquerading as universal concerns. Tikva Frymer-Kensky has pointed out the problem: The God of Biblical Israel is grammatically male: all the verbal forms, adjectives and pronouns are masculine. God in the Bible is also sociologically male: the husband, the father, the king ... . This cumulative impact of male-centered language and imagery is profoundly alienating to women .... The fact that these images are used for God ... reinvests these male images with ... status and power. Women are completely left out of both the imagery and the power loop.12 If we did not have to contend with committees, what solutions could we offer? There is a need to introduce female or gender-neutral God-language into the siddur.13 God's name is not the only problem. What about the marriage imagery: the all-powerful, loving God who protects the weak (female) people of Israel?14 On the other hand, Frymer-Kensky asks about the Friday-night hymn Lecha Dodi: What then can we do with this imagery? We could, of course, toss it out, but in doing so we would not only lose a large part of our traditional imagery but we would also deprive ourselves of its emotional effect.15 She thus states for me the problem that I have as a "traditional" feminist. On the one hand, I recognize the abusive potential of an all-powerful God. On the other, if I toss out many of the traditional images, I lose a lot of the beauty - melodies to words I know, images, associations - that are part of the Jewish tradition that I grew up with. I am often in a state of cognitive dissonance when I pray. On the one hand, I believe that I should not be 167</page><page sequence="8">Naomi Graetz praying to a masculine God, that I should not be using the formula Barukh ata adonai, Eloheinu melekh ha'olam, that I should be using gender-free and inclusive language. When I think, I try to avoid using exclusively male language, to make my own small changes, so that I am at least a resisting worshiper. However, the reality is that this is how I pray, how I was brought up to pray. Thus, my behavior is inconsistent with my belief. It is much easier for me to mix up the gender, to alternate by saying avinu, imenu (instead of avinu malkenu) or to add Miriam the prophet to Elijah when we say havdala at the end of Shabbat, than to actually introduce and use totally new forms such as those Marcia Falk suggests. Intellectually, I would like to, but emotionally it is difficult. Melodically, it takes a great effort, and I might be fighting an uphill battle. So although I am in a state of discomfort in my "egalitarian-traditional" synagogue, I am not acclimatized to some of the newer forms, whose use would probably entail much effort and a change of venue for me. In many ways, my cognitive dissonance is similar to the Masorti movement's (and this siddufs) problem of choosing between tradition and change. Cognitive dissonance may help me to understand why I put up with the old imagery, but, as Frymer-Kensky eloquently points out, there is no going back once we see the light. Once we engage in de-gendering, incorporating feminine forms for God, we can either leave the fold or remain and be complicit. What I and Other Feminists Want Not only the language but also the content of the siddur is problematic for feminists. In the daily Amida, for example, most of the topics addressed reflect men's concerns as if they were the universal norm. From this point of view, it might be easier to write an alternative prayer than to change the God-language, because a new prayer would fill in what is missing, rather than replace a hallowed existing form. Many prayers have already been composed to address women's concerns,16 which are often related to biology and may not necessarily mesh with "universal" or "human" concerns. In his introduction to the morning Amida, Roth points out that the worshiper may add personal prayers - for instance, a request to do well on 168</page><page sequence="9">Siddur Va'ani Tefillati an exam. This presents an ideal opportunity for a woman grieving over a miscarriage or a mastectomy, celebrating the birth of a child, noting the occasion of the first menstrual period or of menopause17 to insert a personal prayer. I would rather see some of these prayers in the siddur I use than keep on praying for the restoration of a Jewish monarchy or of temple worship in Jerusalem - two things I neither believe in nor desire. Feminists would like some choice in male and female images. I have regularly "solved" this problem for myself by using grammatically incorrect forms, alternating "father" and "mother" or referring to the divine "parent." Frymer-Kensky suggests using the technique of "morphing" images, by which we can represent the multiple facets of divinity by seamlessly merging images of "God-the rock-the tree-the father-the mother-the lover-the judge-the male warrior-the woman- warrior,"18 thus avoiding the creation of permanent gendered images of divinity. Rachel Adler points out that although Judaism and its prayer books have changed, women are still required to "temporarily abandon the selves they really are in order to pray in the words of the community, [to] fundamentally disorient themselves in order to orient their hearts."19 She proposes new texts and modes of prayer that may break the rules or undermine the texts we use. But in order to do this, we have first to acknowledge that women as well as men are members of the community; to involve both women and men when we create the new prayers, and to acknowledge honestly the extent to which our current service reflects maleness (in both language and theology), rather than continuing to argue that male includes female. Conclusion I stated at the beginning of this review that I would try to relate only to the product and not to the process. As product, Va'ani tefillati does not adequately meet the needs of the "an/" who is a committed feminist. But if I now view it rather as the starting point of an ongoing process - as a way to engage in dialogue for the future - it might suffice for the "an/" who is a liberal Masorti Jew and a member of an egalitarian community. That this siddur is a step forward for feminists was brought home to me during the 169</page><page sequence="10">Naomi Graetz High Holy Days, during which our congregation uses a traditional Mahzor. My state of cognitive dissonance was redoubled, and I was quite relieved to return "home" to Va* ani tefillati. Yes, the radical in me would like more change. In the introduction, Roth emphasizes: "I repeat that despite all the innovativeness of siddur Va'ani tefillati, anyone who does not want to deviate from the text with which they were educated should have no difficulty in doing so." In other words, the tension between tradition and change has been resolved by assigning more weight to tradition. Any move toward equality involves breaking with a past that was patriarchal in outlook. Va'ani tefillati is a welcome step in this direction; but for Jews like myself, whose feminism is crucial to their theology and to their stance toward God, it has taken the step neither far enough nor clearly enough.

Marcia Falk, in Book of Blessing? (San Francisco: Harper, 1996) has "solved" the problem of addressing our prayers to a masculine God (Barukh ata adonai) who is ruler of the world (melekh ha'olam) by introducing the formula "Let us bless the source of life" (nevarekh et ein hahayyim). This, ironically, has become the standard gender-inclusive blessing formula, though Falk has never referred to her work as a siddur. 4. Yabbia Omer, VI, Orah Hayyim 10. 5.

There were two women rabbis, Einat Ramon and Valerie Stessin, on the 14- member siddur committee, but the extent of their input is unclear. I was told that the word imoteinu ("our mothers") was inserted, in brackets, as a last-minute compromise. 8. Though both the patriarchs and the matriarchs are invoked in the blessing for the State of Israel and for the soldiers in the IDF on p. 373, the land itself is described as promised to avoteinu; the blessing refers to the soldiers as hayalei 170</page><page sequence="11">Siddur Va* ani Tefillati tzahal; and we are charged with loving aheinu benei Yisrael - all masculine plural forms. In Kehillat Eshel Avraham in Beersheba, the (female) rabbi routinely adds the missing female population. Yet even this does not solve the problems of Avinu shebashamayim ("our Father in heaven") and veyashvu ish tahat gafno ("and each man will sit under his vine"). This prayer is a good example of the confused nature of the siddur. It raises the questions: Where do we start? Where do we stop? I shall return to this further on. 9. I was originally asked to write this review because of my strong feelings (expressed in the Bridges Jewish feminist electronic discussion forum) regarding the conclusion of the second blessing of the Amida, which addresses God as "the Shield of Abraham," an allusion to Genesis 15:1. Many feminist Jews have argued that Abraham's spouse, the Matriarch Sarah, should be invoked here as well, and some have suggested the formula poked (or pakad) Sarah ("who remembered Sarah," i.e., by enabling her to conceive). Other feminists have argued against the use of pakad, because it reeks of functional biology. But in the biblical context, if God gives Abraham a protective shield {magen) and Sarah a baby, I ask: which is more valuable? Without God's gift to Sarah, there would be no Jewish people. I stand by my now-silent use of pakad\ Va'ani Tefillati reads Magen Avraham ve- Sarah. 10. I would like to thank David Ellenson for sharing with me in manuscript his forthcoming article, "A New Rite from Israel: Reflections on Siddur Va'ani Tefillati of the Masorti (Conservative) Movement," which will appear in Contemporary Judaism, published by the Institute for Contemporary Judaism at the Hebrew University. He writes on pp. 29-30 that the "move towards gender-inclusivity that marks the ethos of Va'ani Tefillati is most fully and obviously expressed ... by a woman, garbed in a kippah (head-covering), wearing the head tefillin (p. 10). This picture delivers a powerful statement. It indicates that the Masorti movement has internalized a feminist critique that contends that patriarchal cultures posit the male as normative .... The icon of the female wearing tefillin presents the argument that the female is no longer 'other.' From the standpoint of semiotics, this is the single most powerful example of innovation contained in the siddur." 11. As Dalia Ofer and Lenore J. Weitzman (eds.) have pointed out in Women in the Holocaust (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), men and women did not necessarily experience the Holocaust in the same way. 12.

We could use Shekhinah, Malkat Ha'olam (Queen of the World), Malkat Hashamayim (Queen of Heaven), or Rahamema (Merciful One). But are these really solutions? Frymer-Kensky points out that although their "resonance is indeed biblical, [they are] quite negative. ... The historical use of these terms to 171</page><page sequence="12">Naomi Graetz refer to pagan gods gives them connotations far beyond the normal meanings of the words" (ibid., p. 50). 14.
