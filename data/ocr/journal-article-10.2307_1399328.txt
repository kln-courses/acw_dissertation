Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985. Pp. viii + 416. Reynolds and Lovin have performed an important service for the Academy in produc- ing this volume of fifteen explorations of the relationship between cosmogonical and ethical beliefs, thirteen of which were presented at three conferences at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago in 1981 and 1982. Apart from connections between accounts of cosmogonies and ethical beliefs, one learns much from this volume about the differing interpretations writers give simply of what a cosmogony is. There is, of course, the strict account, that of a coming to be of the cosmos. This account is used in the volume most self-evidently by Robin W. Lovin ("Cosmogony, Contrivance, and Ethical Order") in his study of William Paley's theological utilitarianism. The kosmos had its gonos through God's purposeful crea- tion, and the morality of actions is to be determined by their conformity with God's purposes, primary among which is God's will for human happiness. Also apparently straightforward is Douglas A. Knight's treatment of the ethical implications of the creation accounts of the Old Testament ("Cosmogony and Order in the Hebrew Tradition"), slanted though it perhaps is that the five ethical implications Knight chooses to discuss are values shared by liberal humanists of the 1980s (for example, celebrating life, cooperating with others, and respecting the land). Lawrence E. Sulli- van ("Andean Cosmogony and Ethical Order") gives a detailed account of the impor- tance of ordering change in Andean ritual, this ordering being accomplished by ascer- taining calendarial order and the spatial ordering of altitudes into parts of a god's body, with the feet, midsection, and head to be propitiated differently. What these accounts neglect, however, is any effect ethical beliefs can have on cos- mogonical beliefs. To think that cultures or individuals choose their physical beliefs first and derive ethical systems therefrom is a bit of cosmic foundationalism residual from such poisons as the fact/value distinction, Cartesian rationalism, and Humean empiricism. It is surely too simple to say that Paley was a theological utilitarian be- cause of his views about the purpose God wills. Knight at one point says, "The myth does more than present the presuppositions for morality, for in a more general sense it synthesizes the worldview and the ethos of the people" (p. 143). But then all five of his derivations are unidirectional, from cosmogony to ethics. And Sullivan says explicitly that Andeans (as well as contemporary ethicists) base ritual on an ethics, an ethics on a metaphysics, and a metaphysics on a cosmogony. Very clean. Too clean. Norman J. Girardot offers a fine account of Taoism's advocacy of returning to an earlier time when the Tao flowed freely, when people acted spontaneously and purely of heart ("Behaving Cosmogonically in Early Taoism"). In this context Girardot spells out the difference between Confucianism and Taoism as one of cosmogonic emphasis; Confucians want to return to an earlier civil order, and Taoists even further back to a pre-civil order. And it is clear (and unsaid) that on this account of Confucianism and Taoism, the era each system holds up as desirable is part and parcel of the ethical code of each system, not a distinct premise for the codes. If ethically guided action consists in preserving or returning to some earlier state, then there must already have been something good about that state. We cannot get an</page><page sequence="2">515 "ought" from a "was." The good old days had to be as good as they were old. Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty is sensitive to this point. Original separation (for example, of the waters, of humankind from sensory distractions) is not always seen as good. She dis- cusses with ease and range the Rgveda's problem of the original separation having been one of sundering the human from the divine, a problem solved in the Brdhamana by an anthropomorphic marriage, leading, she argues (too quickly), to the theory of karma. She then discusses the influence of Hindu teachings, and how such influence shows that developments in ethical teachings can bring about changes in cosmogonies. This stands to reason; if our notion of good changes, then so must our notion of what the good old days were like. A second interpretation of cosmogony involves not an original creation, but a con- tinual creation. Hans Dieter Betz draws out the remnants of the Hebrew version of this in a ten-verse passage in the Sermon on the Mount ("Cosmogony and Ethics in the Sermon on the Mount"). It is difficult to imagine squeezing any more interpretive matter out of the passage than Betz succeeds in doing in his excruciatingly close read- ing. This same future-based cosmogony is uncovered in Islam by Sheryl L. Burkhalter ("Cosmogony and Ethics in Islam"). At times of crisis the Qur'an is read not to reminisce collectively about some pristine original condition, but rather to reassure oneself of the plan revealed through Muhammad. Frank E. Reynolds detects four cosmogonies of continual regeneration among the samsdric, rupic, and dhammic cosmogonies of the Buddhists ("The Case of Theravada Buddhism"), complete with four distinct ethics. To the extent that the four ethics are distinct (and it is not clear how deep that extent really lies), Reynolds takes his findings as an argument against neo-Kantian formalism, the view, as expressed by Ronald Green in his Religious Reason (Oxford, 1978), that there is a basic moral logic that all ethical codes strive to exemplify. Reynolds takes the multiple cosmogonies within one tradition to pose a special problem for this formalism, but if pointing out diversity across cultures does not slow down the formalist, it is hard to see how throwing in intracultural diversity will help. An additional problem affects the discussions of multi- ple cosmogonies sustained by Kay Barbara Warren about the Mayan Trixanos of Guatemala ("Creation Narratives and the Moral Order: Implications of Multiple Models in Highland Guatemala") and by Lee H. Yearley about Mencius ("A Confu- cian Crisis: Mencius' Two Cosmogonies and Their Ethics"): neither Warren nor Year- ley succeeds in showing that their subjects in fact involve multiple cosmogonies. Even if they do not succeed in raising special difficulties for the formalists, however, one still benefits from the connections these essays draw between ethics and cosmogony. And one hopes that the empiricism which Lovin and Reynolds in the introductory essay argue for in the face of formalism will not degenerate into a wow-look-at-this-wow- look-at-that empiricism. Arthur W. H. Adkins has made two contributions to the volume, both first-rate. In the first ("Cosmogony and Order in Ancient Greece"), he examines the unpredictabil- ity of the Greeks' gods as an explanation for the persistence of injustice in the world. In the second ("Ethics and the Breakdown of Cosmogony in Ancient Greece"), Adkins argues that the traditional Homeric and Hesiodic cosmogonies fell due to the development of the requirement that all injustice be punished. Later philosophic ethics filled this void, while retaining crucial continuity with the past. In both of</page><page sequence="3">516 Book Reviews Adkins's articles we can appreciate the tight and reciprocal connection between ethics and cosmogony. The final two selections interpret cosmogony logically instead of temporally. A "logical cosmogony" is really a cosmology or a metaphysics or a Weltanschauung, but the value of these articles is that they point out the problem posed by comparative ethics for normative ethics: how are we to make the leap? Or, worse yet, does compa- rative ethics show that there is nothing to leap to? Douglas Sturm ("Cosmogony and Ethics in the Marxian Tradition: Premise and Destiny of Nature and History") briefly discusses how Marxism as a social movement is compatible with Marxism as a critique of all social movements, but thinks the problem can be solved by emphasizing that these are two aspects of a single theory, a talking about Marxism's "thick texture," and a waving of the arms. The rest of Sturm's discussion, about the Epicurean metaphysics of Marx, is much better. Lee H. Yearley's ("Freud as Creator and Critic of Cosmogonies and Their Ethics") takes more seriously the self-referential problems posed by these social theories. How can Freud not destroy his own "cosmogony," and how does his insistence on morality as necessarily pathological square with his own virtuous character? These pieces serve to show at least that we cannot do our comparative work and simply swallow whatever normative results are entailed. We, as this book shows us with most systems in the world, must reject any sort of descriptive foundationalism. Burkhalter's essay on Islam was the only one written expressly for the book, to fill a lacuna left by the conferences. It is evident then that there are other lacunae, for the book does not treat us to any discussion of the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa or North America. It is a credit to the fruitfulness of this area of discussion that more is wanted. MICHAEL TABER St. Mary's College of Maryland Time Wars. By Jeremy Rifkin. New York: Henry Holt, 1987. Pp. 263. The urgency of this book is ridiculously out of proportion to its size. Its importance lies not just in its timely Oriental message, but in its messenger: he is not a Chinese philos- opher or an Indian guru, but the president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, located in Washington, D.C.-at the heart of contemporary Western culture. His warning to us is that the computer mentality created by this Western culture is ruining our natural time-consciousness, and thereby ourselves. This is an Oriental message coming from a Westerner, but it does criticize the Chinese perspective, and thus it calls for some Chinese comment. The author's strong rhetoric, sometimes profound, sometimes hyperbolic, engages the reader. The first, and the last, fifty-some pages are exciting; the rest is historical filler. In what follows here, I will give a brief summary and then offer my observations. Something went wrong as we got involved with the nanosecond (a billionth of a second) time-frame of the computer.
