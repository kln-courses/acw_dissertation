<plain_text><page sequence="1">AFRICAN ART at the Naturhistorische Gesellschaft, Nuremberg MARIA KECSKESI ince its founding in 1801, the Naturhistorische Gesell- schaft in Nuremberg has demonstrated a distinct interest in ethnography and ethnology, more intensely so since 1882, when the Anthropological Section opened. This section, oriented to modern physical anthropological, ethnological, and prehistorical lines of research, became particularly active under the direction of Konrad Horman (1894-1930). The greater part of the African collection was acquired during his tenure. Since 1911 the collections have been stored in the Luitpoldhaus, where the objects are shown in permanent as well as temporary exhibitions. The African department comprises some 850 catalogued items, mainly objects of everyday use-weapons, jewelry, musical instruments, and so forth. Moreover it includes a small collec- tion of masks and figures as well as figurally decorated objects that may be broadly classified as art. A comprehensive catalogue of the African collection will appear in 1986 as part of "A Compilation of the Non-State-Owned Collections of Non- European Culture Goods in Bavaria," a project sponsored by the Volkswagenwerk Foundation. One of the most significant objects at the museum is a "nail fetish" (Fig. 2) from Zaire, which, together with a Vili mask (Fig. 8), was acquired by a Mr. Wechsler in the trading post of Pucocao in what was known as "the Portuguese Congo"-now Cabinda. These were given to the museum in 1912. Judging from the stylistic features of the face, this figure, abundantly studded with nails of both European and African origin, comes from the Yombe people of Zaire. The Vili mask is of a wood light in color and weight. Its face is divided into fields of red ochre, white, and black, and the clearly modeled tongue, outstretched on the lower lip, makes it especially rare. An original hair wreath of raffia has been lost. The large Kuba mask (Fig. 7), sold to the museum by Consul K: hler in 1920, is comparatively well preserved. On the basis of the beadwork and the careful outfitting of the mask, it is assumed to have been made in the capital city of the Kuba before 1900. The ears, covered with woven raffia, are shaped like those on the statues of kings. The cowries are well chosen and careful- ly strung-not a single piece has been perforated. From the Luba are a typical cup-drum acquired in 1904 or 1908 and a caryatid stool in Shankadi style, acquired in 1907. Though damaged, the latter piece greatly enriches the collection. Some old abbia gambling tokens that came to the museum in 1903 (Figs. 4, 5), a number of recently acquired goldweights, and ceremonial axes from East Africa should also be mentioned. 1. MALE FIGURE.

An exception is a small collec- tion from the forest region of west Cameroon, consisting of eight carved figures and masks, and a masquerade costume. The history of these can be traced back to Jakob Keller, a missionary from Basel, who offered them to the museum in 1898; they were first acquisitioned and catalogued in 1905. A further twenty- four pieces, including some carved masks, were acquired by the Museum fur Volkerkunde in Berlin in 1897 or 1898, but they were destroyed during World War II. Keller sent a wealth of informative reports to Basel, the ethnologically relevant parts of which Paul Wurm used for his Die Religion der Kustenstiimme in Kamerun (1904). From 1890 until 1893 and again from 1895 to 1898, Keller was active as a missionary in Mangamba near Douala in the Abo region of Cameroon's coastal forest. Yet in the museum inven- tory, the objects he collected are designated as coming from "Nkosi-Land" (Kossi) in the southwestern forest further to the northwest, though he had been there for only a short period, to replace a colleague (this information comes from Peter Valen- tin, Basel). Actually, the objects vary so greatly in style that they could not all be from the same place. Clearly they were collected from the far reaches of Mangamba, but even with the help of Keller's notes, their exact origin cannot be pinpointed. These same notes contain important information concerning the Losango (sing. Isango) secret societies and the functions of the masks and other cult objects used by them. The requisition of these "works of Satan" was considered by the missionaries to be part of their religious activities. They traveled from village to village enforcing the abolition of the secret societies, and their helpers gathered the masks immediately, if necessary by force, before they could be hidden. Keller, who compared the eradica- tion of the Losango in the Abo region to a military campaign, was able to return to Mangamba at the end of 1897 "with abun- dant spoils" (Wurm 1904:29f). Since the cult associations and art traditions of the Cameroon forest region, in contrast to those of the Grassfields, are little known, the Nuremberg objects are presented here, elucidated with the help of Keller's notes. The notes on the Koso cult of Isango in the slave villages of the Susa region, southwest of Mangamba, are particularly informative with regard to the large Nyadi buffalo mask, reminiscent of certain Grassfields mask types (Fig. 6), and to the masquerade costume and the so-called Njimbiri carvings (Figs. 1, 3, 9, 10): "The Isango Koso [the sacred p. 4 &amp; 5.

Through the rattling of planks, tones similar to those of a straw fiddle or a wood accordian are created. The instrument is placed in a hut or on a square, fenced in by leaves. Anyone wishing to enter is required to bring a quantity of pro- visions and exchangeable merchandise, as well as to take an oath of silence. Each member is obligated to pay a certain fee to the association. Should a member neglect his duties, he is tortured, often killed and thrown into a hole. "At obsequies it was the duty of the heir to regale the entire Koso society. When a large, curious crowd had assembled to hear the voice of the ghost, the sanctuary would then suddenly open to allow the Manyang or Kumgang, the Koso clown, to burst forth with a machete in his hand. His head, face, breast, and legs are draped in a transparent, netlike garment. On his head is a colorful cap of feathers. He runs frantically through the noisy, laughing mob, striking at all he meets, storming into a hut, causing the women and children to flee, upsetting a cooking pot from the fire, smashing bowls and dishes, taking what meets his eye; and then disappearing. "After the Manyang has cleared space in the courtyard, the sanctuary opens once more for the Nyadi (buffalo) who appear with buffalo masks on their heads. They are, so to speak, the children of the Koso. If the Koso himself should then let his voice ring out, the Nyadi begin to dance. The Manyang moves among them, continuing his antics. The Nyadi imitate the mo- tions of the wild buffalo, using their wooden snouts and horns to tear asunder the trunk of a pisang which, though high, is quite soft. When this deed has been duly discussed and admired, the door of the sanctuary opens again and the Njimbiri appear on the scene to lead the Koso splendor to its consummation. These are carved wooden figures resembling humans with grotesque faces, some with glass eyes, some double-faced. On one of the figures, a small animal sits; on others the spirals or longish 8. MASK.

They move around the courtyard howling, some with rattles in their hands, and mix with the Nyadi. The Manyang is also at the scene of activ- ities and so the uproar continues until midnight. Then the spectacle ends abruptly. The Nyadi stick a machete into the half- opened snouts of their masks and wound all within reach by thrusting their heads to the right and left. Everyone flees to his hut, and none of those wounded may take action against the culprit" (Wurm 1904: 24f). This description originates from the coastal Abo region at the end of the nineteenth century. It is remarkable that more then seventy years later Hans-Joachim Koloss (1980) recorded a death rite similar in many details in the distant inland Oku area of the Grassfields. In both areas the rattle instrument is the most important cult utensil, and similarities in mask type are evident as well. In Abo, the Manyang/Kumgang, preceding or substi- tuting for the sacred spirit of Koso, appeared wearing a fiber costume and armed with a machete. It was his task to chase away women, children, and nonmembers. This essentially cor- responds with the role of the "running mask" as described by Koloss. In both regions the buffalo masks, regarded as danger- ous, are important. Analogies as to the mates of the buffalo masks might be drawn as well. Yet on that point Keller's infor- mation seems to be inaccurate. Whereas the so-called Njimbiri 10. SKIN-COVERED HEADCREST. BOKI (?), CAMEROON/NIGERIA. WOOD. METAL, BASKETRY, SKIN. 28cm. 9. MARIONETTE FIGURE.EJAGHAM (?), CAMEROON/NIGERIA. WOOD, HAIR, METAL, 32cm. headcrests (Figs. 3, 10) and the marionettes (Fig. 9) probably belonged to the followers of the buffalo masks, his ascription of the anthropomorphic figures (Fig. 1) to the same ritual com- plex seems to be incorrect. Though insensitive to the artistic quality of the masks and figures, Keller took them seriously as manifestations of a devilish paganism. Therefore we are indebted to him for his invaluable attention to details that might not otherwise have been docu- mented. He recorded, for example, that the coastal peoples sold the masks they had been able to rescue from the anti-Losango campaign to the inland peoples (Wurm 1904:14). Noteworthy as well are his remarks concerning the slaves who lived in particular villages or areas of villages on the outskirts of Mangamba and who also had their own Losango societies: "Missionary Keller assumes that these came from Northern Cameroun because most of the slaves on the coast were born there. Their dances are also reminiscent of the West African fetish dances...The slaves have much more trumpery (i.e., Losango objects) than the free peoples; they also have carved idols which the free peoples do not have" (Wurm 1904:24, 27). It is highly probable that the Cross River groups near the northwestern border of Cameroon were responsible for such objects as the headcrests and marionettes in Keller's collection in Nuremberg. In any case, the similarity between these and the ones from the Cross River region cannot be overlooked. The influence from the northeast-the Grassfields-can be recog- nized in the missionary's description of the Koso ritual and the buffalo mask. A detailed study would certainly do much to clarify the nature and degree of influence of the Cross River and Grassfield regions on the Abo and their neighbors.

KLOPPER, notes, from page 69 1. Some of the Katimbitimbi figurines illustrated by Biebuyck (1973:pl.99) are more phallic than the example in Figure 2. This can probably be ascribed to the fact that anthropomor- phic references are neither as direct nor as complex in the former carvings as they are in.the latter. 2. In addition to Ndumbe (Fig. 6), which is discussed here, Biebuyck illustrates an image referred to as Nyabeidilwa (1973: pl.70). Although anatomically complete, this figurine is characterized by a relief-like, two-dimensional treatment of the body and is said to represent the woman who continually abandons her husband to return to her own people. 3. See Biebuyck 1973: pl. 72. The same or a similar carving, seen in profile, appears in a photograph taken during the bele muno rite of the Intumbo Iwa Kindi (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 26). 4. Despite the snake-like qualities of Muzombolo/Mulima car- vings, Biebuyck insists that the formal configuration of these images is deceptive (1973:225). This problem will be dealt with more fully in this paper. 5. Although Biebuyck does not discuss the metaphoric im- plications of the aphorisms referring to the Katanda carvings directly, this aphorism also seems to give expression to the essentially negative, destructive qualities associated with these types of carvings: "I used to love you; fondling destroys good ones; it has destroyed Katanda" (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Photographs, page: 8: Enes Ramos 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38 (bottom), 44, Inside back cover: Richard Todd 31, 35, 38 (top), 39, 41, 42, 43, 45: Maria Berns 37, 40: Barbara Rubin Hudson 52-56: Swantje Autrum-Mulzer 57, 58, 59, 61, 62: Jill Salmons 60, 63: Keith Nicklin 79: Mark Sloan 80 (top): Horst Kolo 63). The latter interpretation is reinforced by Biebuyck's reference to Katanda as a "seducer and person given to inconstancy" (1973:218). Carvings of the Katanda type (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 27) are, however, also characterized by a clear bilateral symmetry and therefore suggest association with positive as well as negative social forces. This is consis- tent with the fact that these carvings are placed in an initia- tion basket whose contents are said to give expression to the unity and autonomy of the ritual community (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 63). 6. Delange refers to the Mulima as "undoubtedly representing the water serpent ngembe" (Delange 1974:254). 7. The latter discrepancy is also noted by Biebuyck, who points out that Kakulu ka Mpito may have "female indica- tions.., yet its name suggests that it represents an old male initiate, since only old high-ranking initiates wear the mpito hat, made of the hide of an ambela monkey" (Biebuyck 1973:202). 8. The Sakimatwematwe carvings are generally said to repre- sent "the man with many big heads who has seen an elephant on the other side of the large river" (Biebuyck 1972:17). An interpretation of the conically formed base of some carvings as indicative of the strength of the kindi through a reference to elephants may also be of significance in reaching an understanding of the use of visual symbols in a figurine said to represent Beikalantende or Keitula (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 81). Although characterized by bilateral symmetry as well as an echo of the V-shaped mouth in the inverted V formation of the stomach area, this figurine has a conical base rather than separately articulated legs. While it has been argued through- out that anatomical incompleteness is generally associated with social disharmony, the conical elephant-like leg appears, on the contrary, to reinforce the positive attributes of the kindi. Significantly, Beikalantende celebrates the wisdom, strength, beauty, goodness, and profound thoughts of the kindi (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 81). Bibliography Biebuyck, D.P. 1972.
