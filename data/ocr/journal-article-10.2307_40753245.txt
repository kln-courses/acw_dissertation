<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Understanding of the Heart" Spiritual Transformation and Divine Revelations in the Hekhalot and Merkavah Literature Daphna V. Arbel This paper will treat the mystical tradition in the Hekhalot and Merka- vah literature of late antiquity.1 It will examine primarily the correlation between inner mystical experiences and spiritual transformation and the divine revelations which they entail. These interrelated aspects are sig- nificant when considering both the mystical dimensions of the entire Hekhalot and Merkavah corpus and those of specific manuscripts. 1 A synoptic edition of various manuscripts comprising the Hekhalot and Merka- vah literature is included in P. Schäfer, in collaboration with M. Schlüter and H.

Arbel JSQ 6 sider these topics individually but instead examine the way they coin- cide. I will focus especially on the personal spiritual process in which mystics become conscious of the divine. Bernard McGinn, in his discus- sion of mysticism, expresses the significance of such an approach: "... it is important to remember that mysticism is always a process or a way of life. Although the essential note - or, better, goal - of mysticism may be conceived of as a particular kind of encounter between God and the human, between Infinite Spirit and the finite human spirit, everything that leads up to and prepares for this encounter, as well as all that flows from or is supposed to flow from it for the life of the individual or the community is also mystical, even in a secondary sense."7 An analysis of several Hekhalot and Merkavah manuscripts seems to suggest that different accounts, which are themselves often enigmatic and undefined, share a common viewpoint regarding mystical goals, methods, experiences, states of awareness, and divine revelations. In these sources the highest mystical goal is presented as that of gaining direct realization of the divine. Such a goal appears to be connected to, or even dependent upon, the adepts' inner awareness and spiritual devel- opment. More specifically, throughout the several traditions present in manuscripts of this literature, there is a common underlying emphasis on a stage of innermystical transformation. This spiritual transforma- tion allows visionaries, at the last stage of their journey, to become con- scious of divine reality and to be able to perceive it directly. Before the adepts can unveil divine visions and revelations, they undergo an inner- spiritual metamorphosis. They alter their human perspective, expand their perception beyond its ordinary limits and, in so doing, gain a new awareness. They are then initiated into the divine realm, understand revelations from a mystical perspective and recognize their concealed meanings. In this way, for a short period of time, human perception and divine reality correspond and become one. During this mystical experience visionaries share the divine perspective, and correspondingly become conscious of God in a personal fashion.8 The following discussion will develop and support these suggestions, based on historical records of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, 73; Elior, "Concept of God"; M. Idei, "The Concept of Torah in the Hekhalot Litera- ture and in the Kabbalah," in Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 1 (1981), 23-84 [Hebrew]. ' B.

Without ignoring textual problems, this paper will adopt a phenomenological-textual perspective in its analysis.9 At- tention will be also paid to religious patterns prevalent in the historical cultural background in which this literature was compiled, namely the Hellenistic-Roman world. /. The Mystical Model in the Hekhalot and Merkavah Literature In the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature a new mystical mode in Juda- ism of late antiquity finds expression. According to this outlook human beings, under certain conditions, are able to initiate a direct encounter with the divine during their lifetime. This encounter can be named a mystical experience.10 Such an experience is often described as an ascent to heaven in which worthy adepts encounter the presence of God in his celestial palace (Hekhal),11 see his visible appearance and take part in divine rituals.12 Contrary to commonly accepted biblical and rabbinical views, such an encounter is not presented as the outcome of an initiative on the part of the divine. Instead to a large degree, it is the visionaries' own decisions, spiritual attainments and inner perception which lead to the experience.13 References to this experience, often named as the "descent to the Merkavah" [Chariot],14 "entrance to the Pardes"15 and "beholding the 9 On the phenomenological approach and its merits in the analysis of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature, see Wolfson, Speculum, 81. 10 For discussions of the new religious approach in the literature, see Scholem, Major Trends, 64; Dan, Three Types, 2-7; Elior, "Concept of God", 98-100; Gruen- wald, "Knowledge and Vision," Israel Oriental Studies 3 (1973), 88-105.

For a common outlook often reflected in the Bible, see Psalms 115:16 ("The heavens are the Lord's heaven, but the earth he has given to the sons of men"); Gen. 11:4; Deut. 30:12; Isa 14:12-15; Proverbs 30:4.

These include Hekhalot Rabbati ("The Greater Book of Hekhalot"), Hekhalot Zutarti ("The Lesser Book of Hekhalot"), Ma'aseh Merkavah ("The Works of the Chariot"), Sefer Hekhalot ("The Book of Hekhalot") also known as the Hebrew Book of Enoch or 3rd Enoch, and the Shi'ur Komah passages ("Measurements of the Divine Body"). These writings do not present information about the mystical path in a systematic or a methodical fashion. Details concerning the mystical tradition are introduced simultaneously with cosmological concepts, magical and theurgical traditions, descriptions of the angelic realm, ri- tuals of adjurations, messianic contemplation, and theosophical specu- lations. Furthermore, references are made in these manuscripts to var- ious teachings, practices, experiences, and revelations, written in multi- ple modes of expressions and presented from different perspectives. Such an exposition can obstruct attempts to draw clear conclusions regarding the nature of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradition. It is im- portant, however, to note the advantages of such a broad, richly layered presentation. As several studies of the mystical phenomena have empha- sized, a wide range of literary texts can be of great value for understand- ing any specific mystical tradition. Scholars such as P. Moore and C. A. Keller have argued that the study of mysticism, which is based almost exclusively on the study of texts, is primarily philological and exegetical. Hence, an analysis of the many-sided mystical literature of any specific tradition can contribute to a wide understanding of the full scope of the specific mystical system.17 In light of this observation it is interesting to examine the multi-fa- ceted Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. Its manuscripts are definitely non-homogenous in style, content and context. Yet descriptions from yarad in Hekhalot Literature", Frankfurter Judaistische Beiträge 18 (1990), 45-69; G. G.

Mystical techniques and prac- tices, narratives of ecstatic-mystical experiences, reports attributed to ancient heroes of the past, descriptions of God and the divine realm - all these sources disclose details of the mystical journey and divine re- velations. Subjective personal testimonies of single visionaries, presented pseudepigraphically as Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana, validate the objective records, confirm the theoretical claims, and add specific personal details.18 Each of these versions is introduced independently as a distinct experience. Accounts from several traditions, however, coincide and share similar religious assumptions and spiritual aims. They correspond as well to objective general descrip- tions and together present a comprehensive model of the mystical path. This model specifies the mystical goals, practices and the various stages of the mystical journey. It describes as well a proper religio-spiritual attitude, which the visionaries wish to acquire, and the realizations and divine revelations which they achieve at the end of their journey. This model seems to affirm common doctrine and norms which stand beyond time and space. Thus they can be shared and attained by all "descenders of the chariot". Righteous heroes of remote mythological times such as Moses and Enoch, worthy visionaries of the past such as Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana, deserving mystics of the present from the circle of Yordei Merkavah, can all conform to the same model.19 18 For theories on the identity of the mystics and their historical/meta-historical backgrounds, see Scholem, Major Trends, 40-41; id., Mysticism, 1-5, 9-13; Dan, Mys- ticism, 7-24; Halperin, Chariot, 377-387; Elior, "From Earthly Temple to Heavenly Shrines.

Arbel JSQ 6 //. The Mystical Goal According to repeated statements, the visionaries of the Hekhalot texts, namely Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana, wish to "ascend to heaven", "behold the King in his beauty", "see the face of God", "gaze upon the vision of the Merkavah", "look at the Shekhina", "catch sight of the heaven of heavens", "view a glimpse of the chariot" or "catch sight of the Mighty One".20 Similar vocabulary restates this goal with expressions such as "gazing", "beholding", "see- ing", and "viewing". Such phrases seem to define this encounter. These related terms are apparently termini technici in this literature. They con- vey the mystical goal in a similar, consistent fashion and refer to a pro- cess in which adepts personally encounter God on a transcendental lev- el.21 For example, Rabbi Akiva describes an experience in which he as- cended "... and caught sight of the Mighty One."22 Rabbi Ishmael, in a similar manner, uses similar terminology: "I saw the King of the Kings sitting on a high and exalted throne, and his servants were attending him on his right and on his left."23 God himself as confirmed in the texts, also wishes to be seen. He "longs for and keeps watch" for the distinguished mystic who can as- cend to heaven and see visions that are concealed from both mortal and angelic eyes: Tutrusiai, the Lord of Israel, longs and keeps watch [for the Merkavah mystic] . . . When will he descend, who descends to the Merkavah? When will he see the heavenly majesty? . . . When will he see what no eye has ever seen? When will he [again] descend and proclaim [this] to the seed of Abraham, his beloved ...24 According to such statements it seems that visiting the heavenly realm and attaining visions of God are not only conceivable goals for human beings, but are actually longed for by God. They are perceived as the ultimate aspiration of both God and "descenders to the chariot". 20 For the mystical implications of the terms, see Scholem, Major Trends, 52-53, 56; Mysticism 14-16, 77.

They suggest further that great dangers threaten to harm the adepts who prove to be un- worthy of the vision: Of no creature are the eyes able to observe it, not the eyes [of a human being] of flesh and blood, and not the eyes of his servant. But one who observes, beholds exactly and sees it, his eyeballs are seized and contorted, and his eyeballs flash and shoot forth torches of fire, and they scorch him and they burn him.25 According to many statements in the Hekhalot texts, the celestial and terrestrial realms are distinct and strictly separated from each other. Angelic beings must purify themselves in a river of fire when returning to heaven from the profane earth.26 Human participation in God's realm is persistently not permitted and celestial guards at every heavenly gate are determined to block the adepts' way and prevent them from entering God's spheres: ... at the entrance to the seventh palace stand and rage all heroes, lordly, powerful and hard, frightening and terrible, who are higher than mountains and more polished than hills. Their bows are strung before the countenance, the swords lie sharpened in their hands. Bolts of lightning shoot forth from their eyeballs, canals of fire from their noses and torches of coal from their mouths. They are adorned [with] helmets and coats of mail, lances and spears hang on their arms ...27 These two attitudes reveal a dialectic approach to the process of attain- ing the presence of the divine. Seeing God is at once a supreme goal, encouraged and desired, and an option which is absolutely negated and denied.28 Different views have been offered by scholars to explain the contradictory aspects related to this question. Gershom Scholem saw God's glory, the kavod, as the revealed manifested aspect of the divine, which becomes visible to the Merkavah mystics.29 According to Itamar 25 Synopse, par. 102; trans. Schäfer, The Hidden and Manifest God, 19-20. Compare Synopse, pars. 105, 276, 966. I have taken the position, suggested by Chernus, of read- ing this passage as a description of the fatal danger involving the vision. This is contra Scholem who sees it as a description of a mystical transfiguration taking place within the mystic; see Chernus, "Visions," 129ff.; Scholem, Mysticism, 60. 26 See Synopse, pars. 181, 198, 220, 224, 229.

Arbel JSQ 6 Greunwald, "Despite the daring modes of expression one can find in that literature about the contents of the mystical experience that the possibility of a direct visual encounter with God is generally ruled out."30 Rachel Elior has stated that "the vision described is not a human vision, which is forbidden, but rather a momentary glimpse of enlight- enment through supersensory perception."31 This human possibility is limited, however, according to Elior. She argues that the Hekhalot lit- erature denies the individual's ability to understand the visions, by es- tablishing clear boundaries of authorities and prohibitions which control the mystics' visions and exegesis.32 Peter Schäfer has examined this no- tion in the light of the transcendent and immanent aspects of God.33 Joseph Dan and Eliot Wolfson have suggested, in different contexts, that the entry to the chariot ends in a deification of the mystics.34 From a different perspective I would like to suggest that the ultimate mystical goal of "beholding God" is seen as the result of the adepts' level of awareness and inner perception. More specifically it depends on their spiritual ability to acquire a degree of comprehension and per- sonal insight, which in turn allows them to attain divine visions and become conscious of their meaning.35 Rabbi Akiva's saying, in the open- ing of Hekhalot Zutarti, can be understood as reflecting this notion: If you want to be singled out in the world so that the secrets of the world and the mysteries of wisdom should be revealed to you, study this Mishnah and be careful about it. Do not try to understand what lies behind you and do not investigate the words of your lips. You should try to understand what is in your heart and keep silent, so that you will be worthy of the beauty of the Merkavah.36 1991), 20 ff.; compare Morray- Jones, "Transformational Mysticism," for the view that in most of the Hekhalot sources there is no distinction between the transcendent God and his manifested appearance. 30 Gruenwald, Merkavah Mysticism, 94.

"Understanding of the heart" appears to be associated not with logical investigation and drawing of conclusions, nor with intellectual compre- hension, but rather with spiritual awareness, insight, and inner under- standing. These are perceived to be prerequisites to achieving the goals of "beholding God" and experiencing the realm of the Merkavah. Furthermore, they enable the attainment of this higher spiritual level. This spiritual level is not attained automatically by faithful believers, nor is it granted spontaneously to individuals chosen by God. This high level of understanding has to be earned gradually by faithful adepts, in a voluntary spiritual process involving various mystical techniques, spiri- tual exercises, demanding tests and ambiguous trials.37 A spiritual trans- formation completes the journey and allows the achievement of the mys- tical goals. ///. Spiritual Journey Reports in various Hekhalot manuscripts refer to the process of attain- ing God as a defined praxis which could be taught.38 Such is the descrip- tion in Hekhalot Rabbati depicting Rabbi Nehunia ben-Hakana intro- ducing the details of the via mystica to his disciples, while sitting between globes of fire and torches of light: We all came and sat before [Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana] ... Rabbi Ne- hunia ben Hakana sat and explained everything involving the Merkavah. All the matter of the Merkavah, the descent and ascent; how one who descends unto must descend and how one who ascends must ascend ...39 It seems that these directions are aimed at the achievement of a tempor- ary experience, described as an heavenly ascent to the divine realm. Such an experience is not continuous or permanent. The teachings include 37 Compare the mystical goals to other eschatological or Messianic goals of heav- enly ascents: Gruenwald, Merkavah Mysticism, chap. 2; id., "Knowledge and Vision, Towards a clarification of two 'Gnostic' concepts in light of their alleged origins", Israel Oriental Studies 3 (1973), 70 ff.; id., "Priests, Prophets, Apocalyptic, Visionaries, and Mystics," in From Apocalypticism to Gnosticism, 125 ff. 38 See Gruenwald, Merkavah Mysticism, 162-163; Dan, "The Secret of the World, the Beginning of Early Jewish Mysticism" id., Da'at 29 (1992), 12-16 [Hebrew!. 39 Synopse, par. 203; trans.

There is no doubt, as Schäfer and Halperin have shown, that several methods reflect strong magical inter- ests and magico-theurgic goals.47 It is important to notice, however, that 40 See Synopse, pars. 338, 344. The phrasing, "to enter in peace and to depart in peace" indicates that the ascent experience is followed by a descent. Compare Synopse, pars. 169, 348, 405, 423, 686, 712, in which the phrasing indicates clearly that the visionaries are expected to descend to earth and testify about their heavenly encounters. Deification, thus, is a way to describe the enlightened position of the adepts only during the experience. See n. 3 above; see also J.

They are used to influence the inner perspective of adepts, their capacity for extraordinary understanding and ultimately their ability to attain divine visions. The terminology employed in sev- eral descriptions clearly reflects the links between the magical-theurgical techniques, the spiritual awareness of the mystics, and the mystical goal of "beholding" divine visions.48 Various explanations of the specific influence of the mystical tech- niques on the adept's spiritual perception have been offered. Parahyp- notic states of mind, auto-suggestion, ecstatic trances, ascents of the soul, states of deep meditation, and dream visions are ways in which scholars have explained the psychological affects of the methods.49 It is not within the scope of this paper to evaluate the genuineness of the ecstatic-mystical experience or to determine its authenticity beyond the literary testimony. What we find in the Hekhalot literature are several textual reports describing spiritual-contemplative experiences during which the visionaries encounter the divine realm.50 It is these reports that we shall examine. In Hekhalot Rabbati Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana is depicted as sitting among his disciples on earth. At the same time he reports the details of his spiritual vision and tells his students about his celestial encounters.51 wald, Merkavah Mysticism, 102-111; id., From Apocalypticism to Gnosticism, 11 and 63-4; Smith.

Simultaneously he participates in the heavenly realm while describing his impressions to his master.52 A state- ment in Ma'aseh Merkavah likewise speaks of this introspective experience: Rabbi Akiva said: Who is able to meditate on the seven palaces, and to catch sight of the heaven of heavens and to see the chambers of chambers and to say I saw the chambers of YW?53 It seems that Rabbi Akiva describes a desired spiritual-mystical process. The adept reflects and contemplates upon the seven palaces of God and puts them in the center of his mental meditation. During this stage of contemplation he ascends to the celestial spheres, experiences a trans- cendent reality of the divine realm and catches sight of God's chambers. He then narrates his visions in heaven to his group, the "yorde merka- vah" mystics. According to several descriptions, only the most accomplished individuals who can prove their traditional knowledge, ethical behavior, and sometime their distinguished family and racial lineage, can ascend to the Merkavah.54 Other sources state that every Jewish individual has the liberty to practice mystical techniques and to embark on the ecstatic voyage.55 In both instances, however, success is not promised. The jour- ney is difficult; it often abounds with physical and spiritual ordeals as well as with religious trials. Adepts are challenged with tricky situations, seemingly impossible tests, and enigmatic questions. These seem to serve the purpose of verifying the adepts' spiritual strength, examining their inner capability, and confirming their proper religious attitudes.56 Only a few distinctive people can survive the hazards and complete the journey. According to several passages, adepts are expected to develop their inner qualities during the ascent. They mount from one state to another in a continual progression while moving towards the final goal.

He refers to various stages of his ascent, which are parallel to specific degrees of spiritual perfection: When I ascended to the first palace I was devout (hasid), in the second palace I was pure (tahor), in the third palace I was sincere (yashar), in the fourth palace I was wholly with God (tamim), in the fifth palace I displayed holiness before God; in the sixth palace I spoke the kedushah before Him...57 Spiritual accomplishments lead the adepts gradually to God's seventh palace. Yet, described in the above section, as well as in several other sources, the ascent does not culminate instantly in a vision, nor does it lead to an immediate participation in the celestial liturgical rituals. Even upon reaching the final destination, the travellers are still not considered "worthy" of beholding divine visions. IV. Spiritual Transformation It seems that reaching the ultimate goal is dependent upon an experience of transformation which adepts must undergo at the very end of their voyage. Several texts describe this process as a crucial stage. It enables adepts to transcend human qualities, obtain a divine-like perspective, and achieve the mystical goals as the final climax of their mystical-spiri- tual journey. References are made in a few central Hekhalot and Mer- kavah texts to a threefold process of self-transformation. This process is described as a climatic experience, which occurs at the last level of as- cending to the Merkavah, before attaining the desired divine visions. The first stage of the transformation process is often illustrated by well-known images of symbolic death. In this stage adepts seem to let go of their ordinary human mentality. They collapse, faint, fall down, lose consciousness, or experience a body/soul separation. The second stage is illustrated by images of rebirth, awakening, or illumination. Adepts alter their previous perception, gain a new divine-like awareness, and reach a deep level of understanding. A heavenly ceremony some- times follows this stage, granting it an official mark. After adepts trans- cend limitations of human perception and acquire the desired level of understanding, they become worthy to behold the King in his beauty 57 Synopse, par. 558. On stages of ascent parallel to degrees of perfection see Scho- lem, Major Trends, 78-79.</page><page sequence="15">334 Daphna V. Arbel JSQ 6 and the visions of the Merkavah. Thus, in the third stage they attain divine visions that no eye has ever seen. Equipped with a temporary divine-like awareness, their ability "to see" is unrestricted. Worthy adepts can therefore behold divine visions with an "understanding of the heart", decode the meanings of these divine visions, and be conscious of God's transcendent presence and reality. This stage, however, is not seen as a lasting condition. Human circumstances and perceptions are not altered and elevated permanently to match those of the divine. Instead, in most of the Hekhalot and Merkavah descriptions, this level is seen to be a part of the temporary mystical experience. This elevated stage is followed by a return to an ordinary human state.58 This process of transformation is not presented as an isolated theme. On the contrary, a similar recurring pattern is present in various pas- sages in several texts of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. The following are several examples, taken from various Hekhalot manu- scripts, which demonstrate this pattern. Rabbi Ishmael, in the opening of the Hebrew Book of Enoch, recounts his ecstatic experience. After passing from palace to palace in an attempt to gain divine visions, he arrives at the gates of the seventh palace. He receives permission to enter and is immediately overwhelmed by God's nearness. Before he is awarded visions of the chariot he falls down and faints, only to be revived and enlightened by Metatron, the heavenly Prince of the Divine Presence.59 He is then invested with divine qualities by God himself and can participate in the heavenly rituals: Then I entered the seventh palace and he led me to the camp of the Shekhinah and presented me before the throne of glory so I might behold the chariot. But as soon as the prince of the chariot looked at me and the fiery seraphim fixed their gaze on me, I shrank back trembling and fell down ... until the Holy One, blessed be he, rebuked them ... At once Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, came and revived me and raised me to my feet, but still I had no strength enough to sing a hymn before the glorious throne of the glorious king . . . But after an hour the Holy one, blessed be he, 58 See n. 42 above. 59 On Metatron see J. Greenfield, "Prolegomenon" to H. Odeberg, 3rd Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch (reprint New York 1973), 125-134; Scholem, Major Trends, 67- 70; id., Mysticism, 43-55; S.

He enlightened my eyes and my heart to utter psalms, praise, jubilation, thanksgiving, song, glory, majesty, laud and strength.60 Metatron then accompanies R. Ishmael on his celestial tour and dis- closes to him the hidden visions. The same formula is used again and again in the account given by Rabbi Ishmael: "Metatron said to me: Come and I will show you ..."61 Consequently he lists the various con- cealed divine secrets that were revealed to him, such as: ... letters by which the heaven and earth were created ... fire burns in the midst of hail . . . lightning flashes in the midst of mountains of snow, thunder rumbles in the highest heights . . . the souls of the righteous who have already been created and have returned, and the souls of the righteous who have not yet been created . . . the spirits of the stars which stand in the 'Raqia' . . . the souls of the angels and the spirits of the ministers . . . the right hand of the Omnipresent One ... that even the seraphim and the ophanim are not al- lowed to look on it.62 When observing the visions, Rabbi Ishmael actively participates. He gives his own version of the experience, and reports his new ability to see and adequately perceive astonishing, extraordinary, celestial sights, usually beyond human or angelic comprehension: I saw fire, snow and hailstones enclosed one within the other, without one destroying the other ... I saw lightning flashing in the midst of mountains of snow, without being quenched ... I saw thunder and voices roaring in the midst of flames of fire ... I saw rivers of fire in the midst of rivers of water, and rivers of water in the midst of rivers of fire ...63 Metatron, moreover, shows to Rabbi Ishmael the heavenly curtain (par- god)^ on which all deeds of all the generations of the world, whether already done or yet to be done, are recorded: R. Ishmael said: Metatron said to me: Come and I will show you the curtain of the Omnipresent One, which is spread before the Holy One, blessed be he, and on which are printed all the generations of the world, and all their deeds, whether done or to be done, till the last generation ... 60 Synopse, par. 11; trans.

First, Rabbi Ishmael faints and loses consciousness. This marks a stage which could be seen as a symbolic death. A stage of rebirth follows. Rabbi Ishmael is revived, elevated to a higher spiritual level by the heav- enly prince Metatron, and is enlightened by God himself. He then gains a special spiritual perspective and an "understanding of the heart." Fol- lowing this spiritual transformation, Rabbi Ishmael is initiated into the divine realm. He participates in the heavenly liturgy, praises God with the angels and sings hymns before the glorious throne. He is also able to exceed the limits of human perception, move beyond images and see hidden and inconceivable visions, normally concealed from every mortal eye. From a mystical perspective he can look at marvelous metaphysical sights in the divine realm. He can see the amorphous spirits of the stars or the souls of angels, watch formless thunder and voices roaring, or gaze at miraculous sights like fire, snow and hailstones enclosed one inside the other. He is also capable of gaining a divine-like viewpoint and observe events in the distant past or the far-off future, which both lie open before him. In Hekhalot Rabbati, after Rabbi Ishmael is asked by Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana to descend into the Merkavah and find out the destiny of the ten martyr-sages, he is devastated to discover the calamities awaiting the Jewish people. Before the heavenly guardian, Hadari'el, comforts him, reveals various heavenly eschatological secrets to him, and permits him to partake in the divine realm, Rabbi Ishmael undergoes a spiritual transformation: . . . when I heard this loud voice, I trembled and I was silent and I fell back until Hadari'el the prince came and bestowed me with spirit and soul; and 65 Synopse, pars. 64-65; trans. Alexander, "Enoch," 297-298. On the Messiah the son of Joseph as a forerunner to the Messiah the son of David, see Alexander, "Enoch," 298, n. t. Synopse, par. 65.</page><page sequence="18">(1999) Understanding of the Heart 337 he placed me on my feet . . . and he led me into the archives of comfort, archives of salvation, and I saw groups of serving angels sitting and weaving garments of salvation and making crowns of good life . . . and he sat me in his lap and told me what do you see? and I told him I see seven bolts of lightning running as one . . . and I heard the sound of a great noise coming from Eden . . . and there was David, king of Israel, leading, and I saw all the kings of the house of David following . . . David stood and uttered songs and praises which no ear has ever heard before ...68 The threefold pattern of self-transformation, including a process of sym- bolic death and rebirth, is reflected again in this report. Initially, Rabbi Ishmael loses consciousness. He is then revived by an angelic figure who elevates him and grants him new life. After his transformation Rabbi Ishmael is initiated. He sees the inside of the celestial archives exhibited before him, and can witness heavenly sights. He is also qualified to take part in divine reality, which does not conform to conventional regula- tions of chronological time and historical place. He hears voices from Eden, sees King David accompanied by the kings of Israel and listens to them praising God in celestial acclamations that no one has heard be- fore. Another account in Hekhalot Rabbati gives formal details about the process of ascending to heaven, which any worthy individual might ex- perience. The text reflects a similar pattern of self-transformation, which results in the achievement of the mystical goals: . . . and whenever one requests to descend to the Merkavah, AnafTel, the prince, opens the doors of the gate of the seventh Hekhal for him . . . and that man then trembles, shakes, and shudders; he is stricken and faints and he falls backwards. He is then supported by the prince Anafi'el himself, and sixty-three other gate keepers of the seventh palaces, and they all support him and say: "fear not, son of the beloved seed, enter and behold the king in his beauty and you will not be destroyed and you will not be burned" . . . and they give him strength and immediately a horn is sounded above the firma- ment over their head and the holy Hayyot cover their faces and the Cher- ubim and Ophanim turn their faces around. And he enters and stands alone before the throne of God's glory ... as soon as he stands before the throne of glory he opens and says hymns that the throne of glory chants every day . . .69 The visionary who completes his journey and enters the seventh palace goes through this stage of transformation. He faints and falls back, revived by the angel Anafi'el and other angels who assist him and grant him new strength. It seems that this stage is declared officially in heaven by a blast of the celestial horn. Consequently he enters the divine cham- 68 Synopse, pars. 124-125. 69 Synopse, par. 248.</page><page sequence="19">338 Daphna V. Arbel JSQ 6 bers, stands before God without being harmed, and joins the throne of glory in the heavenly rituals. In Ma 'aseh Merkavah it is also possible to note a repetition of this pattern of transformation, which entails participation in the heavenly realm and divine visions. Rabbi Ishmael, after being inspired by his teacher Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana's vision of the chariot, learns from him details concerning the praxis of ascent, experiences the ecstatic journey and recounts his spiritual adventure: R. Ishmael said: As soon as I heard from R. Nehunia ben Hakana, my teacher, this announcement ... I got up and asked him all the names of the princes of wisdom and from the question that I asked I saw a light in my heart like the days of heaven ... as soon as I stood up and saw my face shining from my wisdom ... I began to detail off each and every angel in each and every palace ...70 According to this report, the first stage of this transformational experi- ence, the "symbolic death", is mentioned indirectly and is connected to descriptions of the second stage, the "rebirth". Rabbi Ishmael stands up and is endowed with light. We may assume that, prior to this, he was not standing. He may have been "down", perhaps in a state of unconscious- ness, before he was granted divine wisdom and enlightened understand- ing. As soon as he attains new insight and gains "light in his heart", he is able to recognize every angel in every palace and accurately compre- hend details of the heavenly realm. Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana is troubled by such an unusual ability and he questions his disciple, expressing astonishment.71 The famous "water test" at the entrance to the sixth palace can be seen in this light as a procedure intended to verify the adept's inner accomplishments.72 As recorded in HZ, and in HR, at the entrance to the sixth palace, a vision which seems like "thousands upon thousands of waves of water" is revealed to the travellers, who ascend to the Pardes. Yet, "there is not a single drop of water there, only the radiance of the marble stones with which the palace is furnished."73 Unworthy individ- uals are deceived by the appearance of the vision and inquire: "what is 70 Synopse, pars. 580-581; trans. N. Janowitz, The Poetics of Ascent, 51-52. Com- pare to a similar but less detailed description, Synopse, pars. 595, 596. 71 Compare to the notion that a supreme angel is usually describing divine visions, Synopse, pars. 585-586. 72 See Scholem, Mysticism, 14-19; Major Trends, 52-53; Halperin, Merkavah, 86- 92; id., Chariot, 199ff.

Compare Synopse, pars. 344-346, 407-410.</page><page sequence="20">(1999) Understanding of the Heart 339 the nature of the water?" Worthy mystics, being able to see beyond, are capable of decoding the vision. They perceive its essence and therefore see the marble behind the illusion of water. Thus they are qualified to enter the seventh heaven and see God. When the water test verifies the adepts' ability to surpass human perception and adopt a divine-like per- spective, they are considered worthy to behold divine visions. Rabbi Aki- va, according to the Pordes story, is able to see the marble stones behind their misleading appearance, as waves of water. Thus he is granted per- mission to enter the pardes and is considered by God as "worthy of beholding my glory."74 Enoch's elevation from a terrestrial being into the supreme celestial angel, Metatron, as recorded in the Hebrew Book of Enoch, depicts the transformation on a cosmic scale.75 During the metamorphosis, which occurs on a physical, mental and spiritual level, Enoch sheds his human form to becomes a divine figure. Before the Holy One, blessed be he, set me to serve the throne of glory, he opened for me 300,000 gates of understanding, 300,000 gates of prudence, 300,000 gates of life, 300,000 gates of grace and favor, 300,000 gates of love, 300,000 gates of Torah, 300,00 gates of sustenance, 300,000 gates of mercy ...76 I was enlarged and increased in size till I matched the world in height and breadth. He made to grow on me 72 wings, 36 on one side and 36 on the other ... He fixed in me 365,000 eyes ... There was no sort of splendor, brilliance, brightness, or beauty in the luminaries of the world that he failed to fix in me ...77 The transition from one level of existence to another is followed by a "stage of enlightenment" during which Enoch is granted divine wisdom and gains a divine understanding. He is then able to see and compre- hend deep and concealed levels of reality and obtain unseen visions and enigmatic secrets, like the mysteries of divine wisdom, the order of na- ture, the depth of the Torah, or the hidden thoughts of the human heart: The Holy One, blessed be he, revealed to me from that time onward all the mysteries of wisdom, all the depths of the perfect Torah and all the thoughts of men's hearts. All mysteries of the world and all the orders of nature stand revealed before me as they stand revealed before the creator. From that time onward I looked and beheld deep secrets and wonderful 74 Synopse, par. 346.

Before a man thinks in secret, I see his thought; before he acts, I see his act. There is nothing in heaven above or deep within the earth con- cealed from me ...78 At this stage he is not only able to see visions but also becomes a mem- ber of the heavenly realm, almost identical to God himself: ... the Holy One, blessed be he, fashioned for me a majestic robe in which all kinds of luminaries were set ... He fashioned for me a glorious cloak . . . He fashioned for me a kingly crown. . . He set it upon my head and called me "the lesser YHWH" in the presence of his whole household in the height as it is written "My name is in him".79 A similar ability also characterizes all worthy mystics in general. It is perceived as one of their achievements. Like Enoch they are able to behold the meaning of visions, understanding them to be beyond mere images. This view is recorded clearly in Hekhalot Rabbati in a descrip- tion which refers to any mystic who has reached this stage: The greatest thing of all is the fact that he sees and recognizes all the deeds of men, even [those] that they do in the chamber of chambers, whether they are good or corrupt deeds . . . the greatest thing of all is the fact that all creatures will be before him like silver before the silversmith, who perceives which silver has been refined, which silver is impure and which silver is pure.80 In light of this correlation between inner-mystical experiences and trans- formation and the divine revelations which they entail, it is possible to understand Rabbi Akiva's perception of God in a typical Shi'ur Komah version. His account could be seen as the report of a visionary who has gone through the various stages of transformation, and reached the de- sired spiritual level and an enlightened perspective:81 78 Synopse, par. 14 trans. Alexander, "Enoch," 264. Compare a similar description of the mystic's great achievements as recorded in Hekhalot Rabbati: "The greatest thing of all is the fact that he sees and recognizes all the deeds of men, even [those] that they do in the chamber of chambers, whether they are good or corrupt deeds . . . the greatest thing of all is the fact that all creatures will be before him like silver before the silver- smith, who perceives which silver has been refined, which silver is impure and which silver is pure"; Synopse, pars. 81-86; trans, and analysis, Schäfer, The Hidden and Mani- fest God, 41-42. 79 Synopse, par. 15; trans.

His countenance is compared to that of a spirit, to the form of the soul that no creature can recognize. His body is like chrysolite, filling the entire world. Neither the near nor the far can look upon Him. Blessed be His name forever.82 Rabbi Akiva, the archetype of the worthy mystic, beholds God's mani- fested anthropomorphic image in the celestial realm. He sees his body, form, limbs, and specific features and describes this manifested vision. At the same time Rabbi Akiva comprehends the vision's concealed meaning beyond its visible surface. He is able to move beyond images and recognizes God's genuine nature of soul and spirit. V. Parallels in Mystery Cults Patterns of symbolic death and rebirth are clearly not unique to the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. Various models of such transforma- tion are found in very many religious traditions and cultures in mytho- logical, ritualistic and mystical contexts.83 From a cultural-historical perspective it is especially interesting to notice the existence of a similar pattern of spiritual transformation in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysti- cism and in the immediate culture in which they were compiled, namely the Hellenistic-Roman world of the Near East. Influences of Hellenistic- Roman traditions on the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature have been demonstrated by scholars in various subjects.84 The mystery cults of Hellenistic-Roman times seem, in my view, to be a significant source, especially in connection with the process of transformation described beyond reach, Major Trends, 64, id., "On the Mystical Shape," 24-25; id., Mysticism, 118-126,153-186.

Arbel JSQ 6 in the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradition.85 Hans Jonas, in a persuasive article, assigned to the mystery cults a major role in the de- velopment of pagan and Christian mysticism in late antiquity.86 Although the scope of this article does not allow a full treatment of this topic, several of Jonas' observations regarding the interiorization and spiritualization of the transformation ritual are relevant to our dis- cussion. Clearly there are many differences between these two forms of tradi- tion, the Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and the mystery cults. Yet their respective presentations of symbolic death and rebirth, including the interior aspects, seem to correspond. Further, in both traditions the process of transformation is an internal spiritual one that apparently replaces external rituals. Again, in both traditions the attainment of the God is connected with a process of inner development, self-perfec- tion and spiritual transformation. This can be seen mainly in several aspects of the process: the preparations, the ecstatic experience, and the symbolic death and rebirth. A common ritual in the mystery cults was that of "rebirth" (palingen- esia), in which the initiate himself was supposed to have been reborn as a god. The terminology of "rebirth," "reformation," "transfiguration," was coined in the context of these rituals. "Purification" and "seeing" (epopteia) were official steps of any initiation in antiquity. Importantly, in the late mystery cults, as Jonas observed, the emphasis was not so much on the ritualistic external aspects of this process but more on its internal spiritual nature.87 In the late mystery cults traditional ascetic or cathartic preparations which the initiate had to undergo became an autonomous system of self- transformation. In such cases, in Jonas' words, the "seeing" becomes On the mystery cults see surveys and references in K. Rudolph, "Mystery Reli- gions," in The Encyclopedia of Religion, M. Eliade (ed.), (New York 1987), 10:230-239; W. Burkert, Ancient Mystery Cults (Cambridge MA, 1987). In both sources the writers emphasize that the term "cults" defines these groups better than the terms "religions" or "churches". Rudolph sees them as "special initiation ceremonies that are esoteric in character and often connected with the yearly agricultural cycle. Usually they involve the destiny of the divine powers being venerated and the communication of religious wisdom that enable the initiators to conquer death" (p. 231). Burkert stresses their many forms, trends and views (pp. 3-4). He also sees their personal characteristics and their function as providing an immediate encounter with the divine (pp. 90, 112- 114Ì.

Accordingly, "sanctifications and ascetic preparations of all kinds exchange their ritualistic function for a more directly personal one in the life of the self."88 The experience of ecstasy was also associated with both inner-spiritual achievements and apotheo- sis: "Ecstasy, instead of merely certifying that apotheosis has taken place, can in its own right and experimental quality be taken to repre- sent perfection itself".89 As Jonas noted, the highest aim of the initiated was to become per- fected in order to be able to be united with God by becoming God himself. He demonstrated the proximity of the term teleisthai {- "to be initiated and perfected") to the verb teleutan {- "dying"), and empha- sized the significance of the symbolic death and rebirth in late mystery cults: "For the mystery piety this was profoundly significant: rebirth requires a prior dying of an old man."90 These aspects, the stage of preparation directed at self-transforma- tion, the ecstatic experience and its links to inner-spiritual achievement, and the model of symbolic death and rebirth which entailed divine-like status and new understanding, give an indication of the transformation model of death and rebirth in the late mystery religions. This model was gradually spiritualized and acquired several mystical dimensions. As such it corresponds to the transformation process present in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, which seems to employ a similar modus. VI. Conclusion As the discussion has demonstrated, the necessary correlation between a personal spiritual process and an awareness of divine revelations is re- peatedly emphasized in different reports in several of the Hekhalot manuscripts. Despite their different nature, focal points and back- grounds, these texts reflect a consistent view of the mystical path and the necessary stages of spiritual transformation. Following a process of spiritual transformation, worthy adepts go through an inner metamor- phosis. Their human perception is altered so that it corresponds to di- vine reality. They are thus initiated into a higher mode of being and share the divine transcendent realm. They "behold the King in his 88 Jonas, "Myth and Mysticism," 323. 89 Jonas, "Myth and Mysticism," 322. 90 Jonas, "Myth and Mysticism," 321.</page><page sequence="25">344 Daphna V.

The different manuscripts of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature present the option of seeing visions of the divine, impossible for most humans, as an inner spiritual-mystical accomplishment. It is achieved by worthy adepts in the course of a mystical encounter. During this en- counter, for a short time, human perception and divine reality corre- spond. The mystics see divine revelations and become conscious of God's essence, and as a result of their inner experiences, undergo spiri- tual transformation and an "understanding of the heart".</page></plain_text>
