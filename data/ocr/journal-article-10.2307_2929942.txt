<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOM KEENAN Bibliography of Texts by Paul de Man I would never have by myself undertaken the task of establishing such a collection.... Such massive evidence of the failure to make the various individual readings coalesce is a somewhat melancholy spectacle. The fragmentary aspect of the whole is made more obvious still by the hypotactic manner that prevails in each of the essays taken in isolation, by the continued attempt, however ironized, to present a closed and linear argument. This apparent coherence within each essay is not matched by a corresponding coherence between them. Laid out diachronically in a roughly chronological sequence, they do not evolve in a manner that easily allows for dialectical progression or, ultimately, for historical totalization. Rather, it seems that they always start again from scratch and that their conclusions fail to add up to anything. -Paul de Man, "Preface," The Rhetoric of Romanticism, viii. BOOKS A.
