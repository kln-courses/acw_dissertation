<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE MAU MAU PROBLEM W1 THEN disasters occur, it frequently appears that an earlier analysis of existing scientific principles, and a study of currently available information on similar incidents or situations elsewhere, might have provided the fore- sight necessary to avert such catastrophes. This is especially true in cases involving the contact of European and preliterate cultures, such as the current one in Kenya. Too long have social scientists, administrators and laymen felt that, whenever two cultures came in contact, one of them had to suffer, be trodden upon, and possibly be completely de- stroyed. That this need not be true has been shown clearly in the case of the Motu of Papua-New Guinea,' where an in- digenous Melanesian population, after eighty years of continu- ous exposure to white contact, has been able successfully to ad- just itself to new technological methods and new sociological demands, retaining at the same time such features of its tribal organization and custom as were compatible with the new situ- ations, thus assuring the continuity of tribal and cultural in- tegrity and values. But such a situation can be maintained only by a thorough understanding of the culture of the peoples concerned, and by a positive approach to the problems which must inevitably arise from time to time in the course of con- tinued contact between indigenous and European cultures. Therefore, in order to understand fully the difficulties now facing the British Colonial Administration in Kenya, and the problems of both the white settlers and the Kikuyu tribesmen who are the original inhabitants of the region, it is necessary to know, first of all, the anthropological facts underlying the current trend of events in that area. The Kikuyu have apparently lived for about seven or eight 1 Annette Rosenstiel, The Motu of Papua-New Guinea: A Study of Successful Ac- cstlturation, Ph.D. Dissertation, Columbia University, 1953 (Ann Arbor, University Microfilm).

Kikuyu myths indicate the exact spot in the Fort Hall district where the tribe came into being, and describe in detail the physical appearance and manner of living of the people who preceded them in the area.2 Much of this has been substan- tiated by archaeological discoveries in the region, and by the fact that a people similar to those described in the myths have been found living not far away. In the days before the white man came, the Kikuyu herded goats and sheep, using bushland-not grassland-for pasture. These animals were indispensable in the round of ritual gift giving and sacrifices which continued throughout Kikuyu life, and which were required on 108 separate occasions. The culti- vation of the land itself was rigorously controlled. Certain plots were set aside for forestation, certain bush tracts were re- served for grazing, and the system of farming made it possible to function as tenant farmer on another's land, or, under spe- cific circumstances, to purchase land from another as private property. It is this latter possibility which is most important in the present instance. Kikuyu law proscribed the acquisition of land through conquest alone. It therefore became necessary, if one desired to acquire land, to secure it by purchase, accord- ing to set rules of procedure, which included mutual adoption of the families concerned to secure the appeasement of the an- cestral spirits who occupy the land, and likewise involving the sanction of the entire family making the sale, and a final reli- gious marking of the boundaries. The education of the Kikuyu child consisted in not only the usual practical education of the primitive, concerned with the learning of industrial and agricultural techniques. It was ac- tively organized around the conscious inculcation of codes of behavior, and instruction of the growing child, beginning at the age of eight or nine years, in the traditions of the tribe, its folklore, its religion, and, most importantly, the social duties and obligations of the child both as an individual and as a mem- 2 L.

The Kikuyu worship an anthropomorphic god who is omnis- cient and omnipotent, in whom they have supreme trust, and whose places of worship are considered sanctuaries. Their re- ligion includes also a certain amount of ancestor worship, and an animistic belief in spirits. Traditionally, there was a sharp distinction between white magic, which was beneficial, under- taken by day, and black magic, which was used under cover of darkness to work harm. Sorcerers who worked black magic were put to death, whereas " witch doctors " who exorcised magic and cured illness were honored and respected. They had a vast knowledge of the medicinal use of herbs.3 Quarrels which could not be settled amicably were brought to the Kikuyu judges for adjudication. To assure an equitable hearing, gifts were presented to the judges by both parties. If the judge's decision was not considered satisfactory, the ag- grieved parties could as a last resort submit to the taking of the ritual blood oath. This was the most serious ritual in all Kikuyu life. Based on a deep fear of magic, it was taken only after family deliberation, and involved calling down upon one's family the wrath of the supernatural powers as a punishment for perjury when taking the oath. The first family to suffer a death after the taking of the oath was believed to have perjured itself, and, on this basis, the judge either sustained or reversed his previous decision. Since the oath was so important that it could supersede the highest Kikuyu tribunal, and could lead to reversal of decision through the intervention of supernatural forces, it can readily be seen that the power of the oath not only was a basic part of Kikuyu justice, but was considered a powerful link between man and the supernatural. It is significant that, according to tradition, the Kikuyu oath must be taken voluntarily, by male adults only, and with the approval of the entire family. It must be taken in public, by day, and before as many witnesses 3 Leakey says that analysis of this herbal lore would more than repay serious study by modern medical researchers.</page><page sequence="4">422 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXVIII as possible if it is to have any validity. The power of this oath could be broken only by a ritual " cleansing ceremony ". Until the middle of the nineteenth century, Kikuyu lands were fully occupied, and the people were busily engaged in agri- culture, animal husbandry, and trading with Mohammedan caravans which touched the boundaries of their territory. It was a relatively stable population, since the high rate of infant mortality (it has been estimated at 60 per cent), religious taboos on marital intercourse for as long as three years follow- ing childbirth, and the knowledge and use of indigenous birth control measures other than abstinence acted as stringent con- trols on any unprecedented population increase. It can there- fore be seen that, in precontact times, the Kikuyu had firmly- established roots in the land on which they lived, and a culture whose stability was threatened only by the same natural forces and phenomena which sometimes affect large segments of civi- lized communities, as well-namely, natural catastrophes such as epidemics, pests and plagues. Ten years before the arrival of the first white settlers, dis- aster struck. Periodic epidemics of smallpox decimated the population. A rinderpest attack killed the cattle. A period of drought followed by famine killed off an estimated 20 to 50 per cent of the population. - Finally, a plague of locusts devas- tated the entire territory. The Kikuyu living in the Kiambu district (which is now in dispute) fled for their lives to the homes of fellow tribesmen farther south, leaving their lands unoccupied. When the European settlers arrived in the open- ing years of the twentieth century, they found this deserted land, in many instances forested or overgrown with bush, and assumed that it was no longer wanted by the Kikuyu. It was land very much like that in England. The newcomers visual- ized fertile grasslands and fields, and paid the remaining Kikuyu for the land, taking immediate possession of it.4 They 4 Compare this indiscriminate sale of native lands with the careful policy pursued in Papua. There, the government's first proclamation, made in 1883, guaranteed permanent protection of native lands, and in 1906 the Papua Act placed all lands under leasehold and outlawed freehold transactions. The government purchases land from the natives only after determination that "the land is not required or likely to he required by the owners," and it is then leased for varying periods to settlers.</page><page sequence="5">No. 3] THE MAU MAU PROBLEM 423 did not know, nor did they apparently take the trouble to find out, that brushlands were the traditional pastureland for sheep and goats in Kenya, and had been specifically reserved for that purpose. This was the first mistake that the settlers made in their relations with the Kikuyu, and one to which is directly traceable the rallying cry of the Mau Mau, "Take back the land which the white man has stolen from us! This, of course, the white man vociferously denies, citing as evidence of his good faith the actual payment of money for the land. Nevertheless, had a study of tribal custom been made prior to the transactions, it would have been found that these particular lands were not " deserted tribal lands ", but privately owned plots, and that they could not be alienated or purchased by agreement with any one member of the tribe. Since the settlers neither spoke the language nor understood Kikuyu cus- toms, they did not know that they had not made a lasting covenant for the land according to Kikuyu law. The binding elements of such a transaction had been lacking. They had not received the sanction of the entire family, there had been no mutual adoption ceremony, nor had any religious ceremony been held to mark the boundaries of the purchase. So far as the Kikuyu were concerned, the settlers had purchased only rights to cultivation, and not the land itself. Nevertheless, at the time, the natives either returned to the reservations which had been set aside for them, or remained as " squatters " on the now European-owned land. With the coming of the missionaries, and the official condem- nation of much of the traditional training and many of the indigenous religious beliefs and practices, the basic meaning de- parted from Kikuyu life, and ritual ceremony was reduced in the main to a few external manifestations accompanying the puberty rites. The training of the earlier period, with its stress on character formation, disappeared, and, since nothing really adequate was introduced in its place, the result has been one of degeneration, loss of personal integrity and dignity, and con- sequently an ever-increasing sense of insecurity and discontent. This was further emphasized in family life, by the introduc- tion of the multi-family dwelling, in which all wives, children,</page><page sequence="6">424 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXVIII and the husband himself lived under one roof, contrary to tradition.5 This led to the breakdown of the autonomy of the individual family groups, and the increase of intra-family fric- tion. The gradual disappearance of the " marriage insurance " gift,0 and the substitution of money for the traditional gift of animals, led to a lessening of the serious aspect of the gift, and the consequent insecurity of marriage itself, since it was no longer a matter of concern for the entire family group when the question of the arrangement-or disruption-of a marriage arose. With the gradual discontinuance of the giving or sacri- fice of animals at the various life crises, these ceremonies like- wise dwindled to mere vestiges of what had formerly been very significant features of Kikuyu life. In the period following the arrival of the white man, the Kikuyu population began to mount rapidly. This is attribut- able partly to improved health conditions, and partly also to the fact that indigenous birth-control methods had been dis- continued as a result of missionary disapproval. The native reservations became seriously overcrowded, and those people whose lands had been originally located in Kiambu instituted claims for the restoration of their lands, which they now needed desperately. When these claims were refused, on the grounds that the lands had been legitimately purchased, the native in- terpretation of the invalidity of the " sale " was revealed. Nevertheless, although some compensation was given to the Kikuyu, it was declared impossible to restore the lands, since they were then being profitably worked by the settlers occupy- ing them. The natives remained on their reservations, over- crowded and more dissatisfied than ever. Beginning in 1922, a series of native movements arose, whose avowed purpose was to secure the return of these " lost lands ". They were led by men like Harry Thuku, whose Kenya Central 5 The Kikuyu are traditionally polygamous. Each wife, by custom, has ber own hut, and the husband has his own hut, where he sleeps alone. The new type of dwelling is contrary to this custom. 6 This was the traditional gift of animals (sometimes called the "bride price ") made by the groom's family as a unit to the family of the bride. In the event of the breakup of the marriage, if the bride was judged at fault, the gift had to be re- turned intact, plus the estimated increase over the period of the marriage. It was therefore a potent factor in assuring the permanence of the marriage.</page><page sequence="7">No. 3] THE MAU MAU PROBLEM 425 Association later made violent demands and was declared sub- versive, Jomo Kenyatta, Jesse Kariuki and Joseph Kangetha, " men with a mission," who formed separatist churches with autonomous schools independent of government control. Many Kikuyu joined these separatist movements. In the 1930's, the Kenya Teachers College was started by Peter Koinange. It was later headed by Jomo Kenyatta, who had been educated abroad in England and Moscow. Here the precepts of the secret order known as the Mau Mau were taught, safe from government de- tection or interference, for the school refused to accept a gov- ernment subsidy, and thus was not subject to governmental inspection or check of any kind. Here were positive indications of dissatisfaction, and the po- tential for later active anti-white reactions. Nevertheless, apart from coercive measures such as the arrest of leaders of move- ments which were demonstrably subversive, the government took no steps to remedy the situation, being apparently oblivi- ous to the deeper issues involved. The really surprising thing is that, in 1922, a study had been published which presented an anthropological analysis of much significance for the future well-being of both Europeans and natives in the area, if its mes- sage had been heeded.7 Hobley's analysis of the beliefs and cus- toms of the people provided many vital clues which the ad- ministrators would have found of great help in planning their programs and in maintaining order and administering justice. It has been well said: . . without some such knowledge of the natives' point of view it is impossible to govern him wisely and well . . . to legislate for savages on European principles of law and morality, even when the legislator is inspired by none but the most benevolent inten- tions, is always dangerous, and not seldom disastrous....8 Hobley emphasized also the importance of understanding the tribal language, and the ineffectiveness of the use of Swahili as a lingua franca, since so few of the elders of the tribe-those who know the tribal law best-were conversant either with it or with English, and he stressed the necessity of intercultural 7 C. W. Hobley, Bantu Beliefs and Magic (London, 1922). 8 Ibid., Introduction by James Frazer, pp. 8-9.</page><page sequence="8">426 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXVIII understanding for the establishing of permanent, amicable rela- tions between the two peoples. But Hobley's hope that his material might be considered as of more than academic value was apparently not realized. The native discontent continued, fanned by the teachings of the Mau Mau. Reaction became more violent, and, with the grant- ing of city status to Nairobe, in 1948-1949 the native leaders again pushed their claims for " the land that was stolen by the white man." Membership in the ranks of the Mau Mau swelled, and in 1953 active terrorism broke out, resulting in thousands of tribal deaths, reprisals by government troops, re- taliatory actions by non-Mau Mau tribesmen, and, more re- cently, guerrilla warfare and intra-tribal conflict on an organ- ized scale. Today, thirty years after Hobley's suggestions were ignored, Kenya is rife with fear, tension and military action. The solutions now under consideration are: 1. Arrest, imprisonment and punishment of all Mau Mau ringleaders. 2. Organized military action against the Mau Mau. 3. Scientific inquiry into the basic problems involved, to be followed by adoption of measures which will be com- patible with native custom and tradition. Of these, the first two are in continuous use at the present time, with dubious results, and the third is in the process of being undertaken. The question now is whether it will prove more effective than the other two have been, and under what conditions. The success of this last plan depends, in the main, upon the extent to which it incorporates the cultural antidotes for the factors employed by the Mau Mau organizers in the formation of the closely knit group which they now control. It must be realized that the leaders of the Mau Mau movement are fully conversant with every phase of Kikuyu culture and be- lief. They have seized on the most important ones, which are precisely those which the white man overlooked in his early contact with the Kikuyu, as the foundations of the movement -the importance of the land as a religious, social and economic link within the society; and the sacred, fearsome and binding quality of the Kikuyu oath. Upon these rests their case.</page><page sequence="9">No. 3] THE MAU MAU PROBLEM 427 The Mau Mau are bound together with the same type of blood oath their ancestors used in the settling of difficult prob- lems which could not be settled amicably before the judges, calling down on themselves the punishment of the supernatural powers in the event of perjury under oath, or failure to keep it. In the present case, the oath was sworn to rid the country of the white man, in order to regain the land which once was theirs. Had the movement been understood from the begin- ning in its wider ramifications, and the proper steps taken at the outset, the present strife and bloodshed might have been averted, and an equitable solution found sooner. As early as 1922 (if not even earlier) a specific was offered for the solu- tion of the problem: the study of the cultural background of the people in an attempt to understand their ideology and point of view, and thus to avert misunderstanding and errors in ad- ministration which grow increasingly difficult to rectify. Such foresight was lacking in this instance; with hindsight, it may be possible to prevent similar occurrences elsewhere in the future. Scientifically, there is a precedent for the treat- ment of such nativistic outbreaks as the one in Kenya, a method which has worked very effectively in the past. The pattern of the Mau Mau movement is similar to that observed in the study of cargo cults in Melanesia, and other nativistic cults through- out the world. The common basis for these movements lies in native dissatisfaction with things as they are, a feeling of in- feriority, of having had withheld from them the things which they believe are rightly theirs. The reactions, with local varia- tions, consist in the appearance of native leaders, having super- natural sanctions, who promise to secure the expulsion of the white man from the area, and yet enable the natives to retain all the " wonders " of the white man's civilization. The move- ments incorporate from the indigenous ideology and religion those features of greatest significance to the natives, and at the same time often require destruction of objects hitherto con- sidered sacred. Thus in the movements themselves we find further demonstration of the confusion existing in the culture from which they arise. The Mau Mau movement displays all these features. It is a</page><page sequence="10">428 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXVIII spontaneous manifestation of the Kikuyu people. Since all nativistic movements are reactions against white domination, the Mau Mau cannot be considered as distinct in this respect. Jomo Kenyatta was trained in England and Moscow, it is true, but all leaders of cargo and nativistic cults have been exposed to European (or mission) training. In this instance, it is only the degree of exposure that differs. The movement is based upon the emphasis on the importance of the land as a religious and social symbol, and most of all upon the sacred, binding quality of the oath. The conflict (which in Melanesia resolves itself into the rejection of such religious items as bull-roarers, the destruction of gardens, and the replacing of traditional ceremonies by new ones devised by the leaders) among the Mau Mau has arisen out of the very quality of the oath itself. W&amp;re have seen how the oath is a fearsome thing, taken volun- tarily but never lightly, never under any circumstances broken except under penalty of severe supernatural punishment, but removable by a ritual " cleansing ceremony". Upon this the Mau Mau counted for the upholding of the morale of their or- ganization. But, when matters did not proceed as rapidly as they desired, they attempted to speed up their " membership drive " by instituting procedures which to many Kikuyu- Christian and non-Christian alike-destroyed the very validity of the oath which was their mainstay. They forced men, women and children to take the oath secretly, at night, inside their huts. They forbade members to talk of the oath to others not in favor of it, and threatened, further, to murder anyone attempting to take the " cleansing ceremony ". Since tradi- tion requires that the oath be taken voluntarily by day, before a large group of witnesses, and with full permission of the en- tire family group, and is restricted to adult males only, it is easy to understand that a conflict in interpretation as to its validity should arise. By its current method of administration, according to native belief, the oath became a tool of black magic instead of an aid to the administration of justice, as it had been in traditional times. Such a conflict, carried to its ultimate conclusion within the society itself, could conceivably have led to the eventual dis-</page><page sequence="11">No. 3] THE MAU MAU PROBLEM 429 continuance of the movement, or to the unmasking of the leaders of it as charlatans seeking personal aggrandizement rather than the good of the entire group. However, such a termination would be possible only if the movement were al- lowed to run its own course. It is difficult for an administra- tor, who is naturally interested in the successful termination of his own term of service in the area, to allow such a movement to run its course uninterrupted. The tendency is usually to seek to control it as quickly as possible, and this often involves police or military tactics. Therein lies the most vital error in the attempted control of such movements as the Mau Mau. But it is important that such " lack of interference " be based upon scientific information. This is always more valuable if secured before action is taken, rather than after the horse has run away from the stable, so to speak, as has occurred in the present Mau Mau outbreak. An excellent precedent for the amicable settlement of such nativistic disturbances through a nonintervention policy on the part of the administration exists in Papua, where the Australian government has from the outset operated under a long-range, scientific policy, and has based its actions and regulations on the reports and suggestions of trained anthropologists in its em- ploy.9 As a result of cultural analysis of the factors involved in a cargo cult which had been spreading rapidly over the Gulf Area of Papua, the government (in spite of the fact that the administrator disagreed personally with some of the anthropol- ogist's interpretations) took his general advice and refrained from interference, with the ultimate result that the movement died out gradually, and some of the leaders were unmasked as impostors by their fellow tribesmen.10 In other instances, also, the Australian administration in Papua has showed an understanding of the necessity for close cooperation between administrators and anthropologists, and of 9 Annette Rosenstiel, " The Importance of the Time Factor in the Effective Ad- ministration of Social Change" (unpublished Ms.). lo F.

LXVI the scientific application of administrative policy in accordance with the cultural background of the native peoples.'1 In cases involving native land tenure, the administration in Papua was careful not to alienate any native land by methods contrary to native custom. It employed native interpreters and " asses- sors " in its conduct of court cases involving natives, so that penalties were imposed in accordance with tribal custom, and the law was flexible enough to vary the punishment to fit the degree of " sophistication " of the native. Murder to the Pap- uan is often retributive justice, but in cases where such murder was committed by a member of a tribe which had been for many generations in close contact with the white man's ideol- ogy, the punishment was more severe than it would have been for a " bush" native, who was relatively unfamiliar with the white man's customs. Compare this with conditions in East Africa, where native customs were not fully understood, and where Kikuyu appearing before a court of law, in following native custom by attempting to give presents to the judges in charge, were accused of attempted bribery! The administrative program in Papua, too, was geared to a long-range plan for the improvement of the condition of the natives, a development from within the native culture, on a solid foundation of indigenous social, religious and economic life. In this way, cultural substitutions were made gradually, and were accepted even before the native way of life was sig- nificantly affected to accord with the changes introduced by European culture. This program, instituted in 1907 under Sir Hubert Murray, was in full force at the time of the first or- ganization of the Mau Mau in Africa in 1922. It is amazing to note that at the same time that significant anthropological data regarding this latter area were apparently being consigned to dusty bookshelves, material of the same type was being actively employed in Papua in an effort to guarantee the continuance of the " Papuan way of life ", while giving the Papuan the op- portunity of advancing in accordance with the white man's technology and ideology, on a voluntary basis. 11 Rosenstiel, The Motu of Papua-New Guinea.</page><page sequence="13">No. 3] THE MAU MAU PROBLEM 431 It is only now, apparently, that the administration of East Africa has come to the realization that in order to govern a people effectively you must understand them; that in order for them to cooperate with you, you must first speak their lan- guage, and see that they understand yours and perceive the true significance of what you are proposing. In Papua this is so. The native dialects have all been recorded, and are understood by the administrators responsible for the particular areas. In East Africa we are told that Swahili is used as a lingua franca, but, since it is not understood by the elders of the Kikuyu tribe and few of the whites speak Kikuyu, it is practically im- possible to reach an understanding on a given issue which is satisfactory to all concerned. Leakey suggests, rather naively: " As Kikuyu is a very hard language for Europeans to learn, the alternative would be more teaching of English to Afri- cans." 12 This would necessitate the simultaneous acquisition on the part of the Kikuyu of both the mechanics and the con- ceptual implications of the English language, both of which are difficult to grasp at the outset, even for a person educated in the Indo-European tradition. This policy was tried in Papua and discontinued as unsatisfactory. It was replaced by pre- liminary training of the native in his own language, followed at a later time by training in English. But the administrators spoke the native language, and white settlers made it a point to speak the language of the people among whom they lived. The studies now being made by the Royal Commission on Land and Population can reach an effective and permanent solution of the present difficulties in Kenya only if they take into account the cultural factors involved in the present dis- pute, making fullest use of all available anthropological data now extant on the area and requesting, in the future, periodic anthropological reports which would reveal the manner in which the program was affecting the tribe. In this way the ad- ministration could keep its finger on the Kikuyu pulse and would be able to avert-or settle in its incipient stages-any 12 L. S. B.

LXVIII further manifestations of dissatisfaction or frustration on the part of the natives. In view of the present crisis, and the urgent need of an early halt to the waves of Mau Mau terror- ism, it would seem that a wise and constructive policy should immediately be undertaken-one not conjured up in the spirit of vengeance or retribution leading to the wholesale execution of Mau Mau leaders if discovered and brought to trial, but in a manner reflecting the wisdom and understanding of the ad- ministrators. Once again, utilizing the precedent set in Papua by the adaptation of white man's justice to the native code, would it not be feasible here, as it was in Papua, to " make the punishment fit the crime," by basing it upon the degree of familiarity of the accused Mau Mau with white man's culture and the length of his exposure to it; on whether he was a ring- leader, an active member, or an unwilling dupe of the ring- leaders; and upon the degree of his voluntary participation in the activities of the group? By such a scaling of punishment, and by a program of dis- seminated information, assuring the people that only the guilty ringleaders will be punished, and that the little man who seeks release from his unwilling oath will not be punished for the things which he did under duress, the movement will in time disintegrate of its own momentum. The duplicity of the leaders will have been exposed, and the people will be only too willing to free themselves of the onerous burden of guilt and secrecy which has been imposed upon them, and to seek the equitable adjustment of their grievances, which the government will then be in a better position to make. This more sanguine point of view than those generally pre- sented is based upon the fact that scientific principles have been successfully applied in Papua, and the belief that they can be applied again.
