<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. New Series, Vol. XVIII. Containing the Papers read before the Society during the thirty- ninth Session, 19I7-i8. London. Williams and Norgate, i9i8- pp. 655. This volume is a remarkable testimony to the vitality of philo- sophical interest and activity in Great Britain. Seventeen meetings of the Society were held during the year, and seventeen papers con- tributed, together with three symposia and three shorter communi- cations. All of these papers are included in this volume, with the exception of those belonging to the symposium on the question, Why is the 'Unconscious' unconscious? which is published in the British Journal of Psychology (October, i9i8). When it is remem- bered that the volume before us is a record of the work of the Society during the fourth year of the great war, with all its terrible trials and strain, one cannot refrain from expressing admiration for the stead- fastness and courage of the group of scholars who kept alive the torch of philosophy in such unpropitious times, and when burdened with many heavy and unusual tasks. It is interesting to read that despite the enormous amount of public work which fell upon them, Mr. 1nalfour and Lord Haldane were able to preside at two of the meetings. Professor H. Wildon Carr was for the third successive year the presi- dent of the Society, and to him doubtless belongs a large measure of credit for the success of the session. The papers of this volume are representative of all the more im- portant phases of philosophy. Of the two symposia here reported, one dealt with the question, "Are Physical, Biological and Psychologi- cal Categories Irreducible? " and papers were contributed by J. S. Haldane, D'Arcy W. Thompson, P. Chalmers Mitchell, and L. T. Hobhouse. The other had as its subject, " Do Finite Individuals Possess a Substantive or an Adjectival Mode of Being?" and papers are published from B. Bosanquet, A. S. Pringle-Pattison, G. F. Stout, and Lord Haldane. There are three historical papers: "Indian Ideas of Action and their Interest for Modern Thinking," by F. W. Thomas; "The 'Modes of Spinoza' and the 'Monads of Leibniz,'" by G. Dawes Hicks; and "The Philosophy of Proclus," by A. E. Taylor. Two papers deal with political philosophy: "Realism and Politics," by I95</page><page sequence="2">i96 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVIII. J. W. Scott; and "The Conception of a Unitary Social Order," by H. J. W. Hetherington. Four are somewhat distinctly theological in character: "The Theory of a Limited Deity," by Charles F. D'Arcy; "Omnipotence," by F. C. S. Schiller; "The Ontological Argument for the Existence of God," by Albert A. Cock; and "The Moral Argument for the Existence of God," by W. R. Mathews. Three papers may be classified as psychological: "Behaviour as a Psycho- logical Concept," by Arthur Robinson; "On the Summation of Pleas- ures," by Dorothy Winch; and "Association," by Arthur Lynch. There remain the presidential address on "The Interaction of Mind and Body"; "Thought and Intuition," by Karin Stephen; "The Development of Criticism," by F. C. Bartlett; "The Conception of Reality," by G. E. Moore; "Is There a Mathematics of Intensity," by J. A. Smith; "Anthropomorphism and Truth," by J. B. Baillie; " Practical Dualism," by E. E. Constance Jones; and " Space-Time," by S. Alexander. It is clearly impossible in a review to give even a brief summary of the content of all of these papers, even if one were at home in all these different fields. I shall call attention only to those that happen most to have interested me. The presidential address with which Professor Carr opened the work of the session, continues, as he tells us, the consideration of the subject which formed the basis of his two previous addresses on similar occasions-the subject of the relation of mind and body. He believes that new facts have lately been established concerning the nature of the mind and the body which will contribute to a more satisfactory theory of their relation. Of these, the most important seems to be the fact, which he regards as established beyond question, that some disorders of the psycho-physical organism, are psychological in origin. This makes it impossible any longer to conceive of the mind as the concomitant of certain nervous changes in the body. "The mind has a structure of its own. It is an integration of coordinated psychical elements or processes-personal memories, tendencies, desires, wishes, and the like-which mutually repress or inhibit one another; or, as the case may be, interplay with and evoke one another. This psy- chical matter has an organization as complete, and a unity of living process as perfect, as the physiological matter of the body. The mind is not an intermittent consciousness lighting up with awareness certain states of the organism and dependent on particular phys- iological processes. It is a structure which can suffer injury, derange- ment or disorder, independently of the physical derangement of the</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 197 body. If, then, there be interaction between soul and body, it by no means follows that parts or constituents of the soul must interact with parts or constituents of the body; it may be that the whole soul, or the soul as an individual, interacts with the whole body as a self- controlled unity of coordinated mechanisms" (pp. 2-3). This is the theory which Professor Carr supports by appeal to fact and argument throughout this paper. No one can doubt that it represents a great advance over the older interactionism and parallel- ism, which used to be set out as the sole alternatives. But one may accept this more concrete view of the relation of mind and body with- out connecting it with Bergsonian metaphysics, as Professor Carr does. Mind and body, he tells us, are antithetical principles repre- senting the dichotomy of an original unity, and appearing in the mutually exclusive forms of freedom and necessity. Now if this is true, one must ask where is the basis to be found of that 'solidarity' of mind and body on which Professor Carr insists. Life in this view is a progressive dichotomy; and it is evident then that there is no basis of unity or 'solidarity' to be found in the process itself, or in its end. One must, as always in the Bergsonian metaphysics, look back to the beginning to justify the unity and connectedness of diversity. The symposium on the relations of physical, biological, and psy- chological categories, contains matter of much interest. The for- mulation of the problem has the advantage of bringing into the fore- ground what is often overlooked in discussions of this central problem, that the categories of the various sciences are assumptions implicated in the particular form of the questions which they severally raise, and must be interpreted in the light of these questions. Their value in any situation depends upon the completeness of the form of answer to which they lead. It is because the requirement of intelligibility assumes new forms, and makes further demands, as one proceeds from the physical to the living and conscious, that the mechanical categories have to give way to others more adequate to the demands of the new situations. This seems to be very clearly recognized in the arguments of Dr. Haldane and Professor Hobhouse, while their opponents, as is unfortunately too common with representatives of the special sciences, seem inclined to regard mechanism as an absolute form of intelligibility, or at least as affording the only objectively verifiable form of answer to which human reason can attain. It is worth while to have the issues thus sharpened. The title of the problem that formed the subject of the second sym- posium reported in this volume is taken from Professor Pringle-</page><page sequence="4">I98 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVIII. Pattison's book, The Idea of God, where he protests against the Spinozistic use of the term substance and the description of all "pro- visional substances as predicates" or "adjectives" of "the one true individual Real." All the parties to the discussion however acknow- ledge the inadequacy of the formula, 'substantial' or 'adjectival,' to express the opposition between the two points of view here under discussion. Dr. Bosanquet and Professor Pringle-Pattison are the chief protagonists, and the point at issue may be said to be the dif- ferent emphasis and interpretation which each has given to the reality of the individual in recently published Gifford Lectures. In spite of the fact that there is much that these two writers recognize in common, there are also fundamental differences in their ultimate attitude and conclusions, and these are here restated with great force and clearness. In general, Professor Pringle-Pattison emphasizes more the existential unity of -the individual self with its 'given' ends and demands; while Dr. Bosanquet finds the ground of its reality in its principle of self- transcendence, which is identified only in terms of a universal content. Professor Stout, who appears on the whole to agree more nearly with Pringle-Pattison, seems to me to make an important contribution to the discussion by his criticism of some logical doctrines which are common to Mr. Bradley and Dr. Bosanquet. And Lord Haldane's admirable review of the discussion contains valuable suggestions as to the means by which the impasse between the One and the Many may be avoided. He holds that the difficulties of the system of Professor Pringle-Pattison on the one hand, and of Dr. Bosanquet and Mr. Bradley on the other-the incomprehensibility of the Absolute -to which both views seem to lead-has its source in the fact that both alike cling to 'relational' forms of knowing, and fail to make adequate use of the speculative categories of reason. The article by Professor Baillie, entitled "Anthropomorphism and Truth," has also certain bearings on the questions at issue in the symposium just described, but it also represents a point of view which seems to me especially fresh and interesting. It is to be hoped that it will lead to further discussion, and that the author may see fit to proceed to develop his position. In defining this position in opposition to contemporary views, he says: " In our own time we find those who, laying stress on the independence of truth, treat the human mind as but a medium in which truth is intermittently realized or focused; the mind is subordinate to the truth, and shapes its conscious process in terms of an 'objective' order or system. In inevitable reaction from this position, there are those who consider that truth is not</page><page sequence="5">No. 2.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. I99 independent of the -mind, that truth is at best but subordinate to and dominated by the prior practical interests of the mind, a mere instru- ment for its purposes. ... The assumption in the one case is that the individual mind is always qualified by a particular element which either is, or should be, in process of dissolution into the universality character- istic of truth; the assumption in the other case is that the particular element is in itself precious to the individual, and neither can nor should be surrendered to the claims of a universal which, however important, is always 'abstract' and incapable of doing full justice to what is particular" (pp. i86-87). Both of these points of view ignore the nature of individuality as essentially development, and also that "behind the processes of both practical action and intellectual pro- cedure lies the more ultimate reality of the single indivisible indiv- uality itself." It is the whole mind as a developing individuality which gives the key to the nature of experience, and it is in terms of it that truth is to be understood. " Individuality prescribes the course which thought has to take, not thought the character which individuality should possess." What is necessary, I think, is that Professor Baillie shall give some further account of what he calls "the solid integrity of the mind's life." One may readily grant that the abstracting process of the intellect is only one of its forms or functions, and yet hold that as a concrete universal its unity is in a real sense logical. And though agreeing with his contention that truth is nothing 'transcendent,' I find difficulty in accepting the 'anthro- pomorphic' interpretation which he has given of it. Under the title of " Realism and Politics, " Mr. J. W. Scott calls at- tention to a connection between "a phase of current thought and a phase of current social theory," taking Russell and Bergson as repre- sentatives of 'Realism.' " Realism is not the view that things are non- mental. It is the view which treats the question of their position in the best arrangement, the best 'place for the soul,' that the universe will make, as quite indifferent to the question of their reality. It is the view that the most indubitably real is the most nearly non-constructed." The thesis of this interesting article is that there is a connection be- tween the realistic temper of mind in philosophy and certain con- temporary social movements which take as their standard the imme- diate and narrow demands of the bare will, without any attempt to harmonize or coordinate them in the light of a broader human prin- ciple. The paper by Professor Hetherington on "The Conception of a Unitary Social Order" forms an excellent complement to this article, and is in itself an admirably clear statement of the classical view of the state as the expression of a 'General Will.'</page><page sequence="6">200 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVIII. I regret that no space remains to comment on the other papers contained in this volume, several of which are of great interest and importance. One cannot help being impressed both by the range of interest represented by the activities of the Aristotelian Society during the past year, and by the scholarly character of the papers which have been produced. I can only close by expressing congratulations, and wishing for the Society a long continuance of such distinguished achievement as is represented by the papers of the thirty-ninth session. J. E.
