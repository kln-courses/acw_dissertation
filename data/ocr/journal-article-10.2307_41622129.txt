Yeha is famous for its well-preserved Great Temple regarded as a holy place and national monument, and which displays a distinct South Arabian style. A second ancient monumental building is also known to have been erected in a timber framework system with direct similarities to a Sabaean building in Sirwãh (Yemen) from the ninth century ВС. An ancient necropolis as well as another temple were also found and partly excavated. Relics from ancient material culture such as pottery, terracotta figurines, and inscriptions were examined. In Hawelti new investigation of the field of stone stelae was undertaken. Some were excavated apart from two cultic buildings in the 1950s. They can now be compared with South Arabian pillars in terms of form, stonemasonry, and incised Sabaean letters. The DAI investigations have strengthened the supposition that South Arabian influence at both sites is not only visible in specific architectural components but also in several other aspects of material culture. The extent of this influence seems to indicate the presence of Sabaean settlers in northern Ethiopia and south-eastern Eritrea from the early first millennium ВС onwards. As well as elements of the culture, religion, and political system of Saba, the Ethio-Sabaean kingdom of DCMT in the Abyssinian highlands also included traditional indigenous elements and moreover, it shows a novel combination of pointing to an acculturation process between the two different population groups and their respective cultures. Keywords: Ethio-Sabaean, Yeha, Hawelti, architecture, material culture Introduction In November 2009 the Sanaa (Sancã3) Branch of the Orient Department of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) cooperated with its Ethiopian partners, the Authority for Research &amp; Conservation of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH) and Tigray Culture &amp; Tourism Agency (СТА) to begin archaeological research at two sites in Ethiopia: Yeha and Hawelti (Fig. 1). Both sites are situated in the Abyssinian Highlands of Tigray not far from the modern city of Adwa. The emphasis of this work is on the relations between South Arabia and the Horn of Africa as there is evidence of intensive political and cultural relations between both areas from prehistoric times onwards into the sixth century AD. The work in Yeha concentrates, at present, on the period of the first half of the first millennium ВС. For this time span, two divergent interpretations of the cultural and historical importance of the archaeological and epigraphic findings exist within current scientific discussion. One research opinion, based on archaeological and epigraphic finds, assumes a Sabaean colonization of northern Ethiopia and Eritrea in the first millennium ВС and the South Arabian origin of the political system during that period (Bent 1893: 134-151; Anfray 1967: 49-50; 1968: 353; de Contenson 1981: 354; Fattovich 1997: 341). The second research opinion emanates from contacts between the Abyssinian Highlands and South Arabia. A powerful, indigenous elite is supposed to have arisen, which adopted some South Arabian features as a manifestation of their power. The presence of South Arabians in Ethiopia and Eritrea was reduced to that of some craftsmen and/or tradesmen; families and even larger groups of people are precluded (Fattovich 1977: 77; 2009: 277. 287; Phillipson 2009: 269-270).1 Interestingly, the concept of acculturation was inserted into that argumentation (Fattovich 2009: 277). 1 It should be noted that in previous publications D.W. Phillipson as well as R. Fattovich mentioned differing approaches. Phillipson considered the possibility of a small number of South Arabian colonists and explained this small number with the supposition that these settlements did not maintain their separate identity for a long period of time (1998: 44-45). Here the concept of acculturation and assimilation might be another explanation for the 'loss' of separate identity. Fattovich expounded that South Arabians penetrated the Abyssinian Highlands from the ninth century ВС, came into contact with the local population, and mixed with it (2002: 12).</page><page sequence="2">146 Sarah Japp, Iris Gerlach, Holger Hitgen &amp; Mike Schnelle Figure 1. A map of the Abyssinian Highlands (M. Schnelle after R. Szydlak, © University of Tübingen). Our new research and investigations on the epigraphic material (Nebes 2010) seem to support a theory that contains elements of both positions: the migration of Sabaean people into the Abyssinian Highlands and an acculturation process not long after the arrival of the South Arabians which combined foreign and local elements. Migration and acculturation need not exclude one another, as the concept of acculturation has to be applied to the Ethiopian as well as the South Arabian population groups. From the South Arabian perspective, a re-assessment of the South Arabian style findings in the Abyssinian Highlands is timely, especially given the background of intensive research over the last decades concerning ancient South Arabian oasis cultures, related chronological questions as well as the general understanding of their material cultures (e.g. Gerlach 2005: 264-265).2 For this reason the Sanaa Branch of the DAI is concentrating on so-called key sites of the Ethio-Sabaean kingdom of DCMT such as Yeha, which was its religious and political centre. Infrastructural phenomena will be analysed; however, as far as possible, a comparison will also be carried out between social structures and technologies, 2 A discussion of the terms that are used to describe the different phases prior to the Axumite period should be included into this re-assessment as well as a concordance regarding their meaning or even the introduction of new terms. At the moment the terms 'pre- Axumite', 'Ethio-Sabaean', 'Intermediate', and 'Transitional' period are sometimes used for the same periods, sometimes with a different meaning (Anfray 1967: 49- 50; 1968: 355-356; Fattovich 1990: 2-3; 2002: 5; 2009: 277; Phillipson 2009: 259-260).</page><page sequence="3">Yeha and Hawelti : cultural contacts between Saba J and DCMT 147 Figure 2. A view from the west towards the front facade of the Great Temple of Yeha in 2009 after surface cleaning (I. Wagner, © DAI). e.g. agriculture and all relics of material culture, including epigraphic sources, will be examined to ascertain their cultural relevance. The Great Temple of Yeha Today Yeha is a small rural settlement, surrounded by volcanic rock mountains and fertile plains.3 In the centre of the settlement architecture of Sabaean origin is preserved, with the main example being the so-called Great Temple of Yeha. This temple is regarded in Ethiopia as a national monument although it is a genuine Sabaean sacred building. It has been seen as proof of the Ethiopian origins of the Queen of Sheba. The monument owes its good state of preservation to the fact that it was used as a church, which was presumably devoted to Abba Asfe, one of the nine Ethiopian saints (Doresse 1956: 54), and is said to have been extant from the sixth century AD onwards (Phillipson 1998: 45). Integrated in the church compound the temple is still a holy place for Ethiopian Orthodox Christians, at which a major religious festival takes place once a year. Moreover, Yeha, with its Great Temple, forms one of the tourist highlights of Ethiopia that is visited by almost all tour operators.4 The temple is located on an elevation with a church directly next to it situated on the highest peak. It is surrounded by a cemetery and enclosed by a double wall. The church inside the temple, built partly with spolia from the ancient structure, was already in ruins 100 years ago (Krencker 1913: 84). Photographs taken in 1906 by the Deutsche Aksum-Expedition under the direction of E. 3 The ancient name is identical to the current toponym, as proved by the inscription on an altar found in Addi 'Akawah (Nebes 2010: 223). 4 In the first campaign in autumn 2009, the DAI designed a concept for the Ethiopian government for the improvement of the infrastructure and attraction of Yeha for tourists within the framework of the master plan being developed for Axum and Yeha. Some measures have already been implemented such as a possible site routing for tourists, the installation of signs, and the opening of a cafeteria with a photographic exhibition.</page><page sequence="4">148 Sarah Japp, Iris Gerlach, Holger Hitgen &amp; Mike Schnelle Littmann show that the building inside the temple was already in a dilapidated condition. In the 1940s the debris inside the temple was used to build the new church to the north (Robin &amp; de Maigret 1998: 740). Excavations at the Great Temple of Yeha were carried out in the 1960s by the Ethiopian Institute òf Archaeology under the direction of F. Anfray and in the 1990s by a French archaeological mission under the direction of C. Robin (Anfray 1972: 47-49; 1990: 18-19; Robin &amp; de Maigret 1998: 737-798). Thus, the Sabaean building has been completely revealed and can be easily observed by the modern visitor. With a height of c. 14 m the Great Temple is the highest preserved Sabaean-style temple (Fig. 2), even when taking South Arabian buildings into account.5 The rectangular building is preserved up to the beginning of the roof, which is marked by a double denticular frieze that can be observed on the northern, southern, and eastern facades. The double-shell masonry with limestone ashlars was dry-constructed. The face of the ashlars displays typical Sabaean stonemasonry with smoothed margins and a pecked centre. The comparison between the stonemasonry of the exterior wall of the Great Temple in Yeha, on the one hand, and of the 'Almaqah Temple in Sirwãh and the 3Awäm Temple in the oasis of MaDrib, on the other, shows clear similarities.6 Additionally, it is known there were Sabaean stonemasons in Yeha through the discovery of an inscription by a workman from Ma3rib, who dedicated his work and his son to the deities, c Attar and 3Almaqah (RIÉ 39; Nebes 2010: n. 57). In front of the building is a propylon with six pillars - with the bases still preserved - which provided access to a gate.7 As a result of our research this can be reconstructed as a broad wooden door frame and presumably with double doors (that could be closed in the middle of the doorway) offering a narrow passage 3 The 3Almaqah Temple in Sirwãh (Yemen), for example, has a height of 10 m. The following description of the Great Temple in Yeha has already been mentioned in previous publications, see esp. Robin &amp; de Maigret 1998. The results and discussion from the current excavation seasons are in preparation. 6 The 'Almaqah temple of Sirwãh is dated to the middle of the seventh century ВС by the building inscription (Gerlach 2003: 98; Schmidt 2007: 219). The 'Awãm temple in the oasis of MaYib was dedicated to "Almaqah and is dated to the middle of the seventh century ВС. According to the building inscription it was erected by the same ruler as the temple in Sirwãh. In 1951 and 1952 excavations took place under the directorship of W. Phillips. Since 1998 the American Foundation for the Study of Man has been working at the site. See Albright 1952: 25-38; Glanzman 1998: 223-225; Maraqten &amp; Abdallah 2002: 49-53. 7 The temple is oriented east-west with the entrance in the west. The main axis is slightly shifted to a WNW-ESE direction. offering a narrow passage (Fig. 3). Two of the recesses for the horizontal beams belonging to the ceiling of the propylon are still visible in the front wall of the temple. The interior of the building was divided into five aisles by four rows of pillars. Each row consisted of three almost square pillars, the bases of which are extant. The two side aisles in the north and in the south were covered by a ceiling. Above it was a second storey, which can be reconstructed based on the composition of the interior wall. The central aisle was open to the sky. Three chambers of equal size were situated at the eastern end of the temple interior. The central chamber can be identified as a cella with two additional cultic rooms on each side. During the structure's use as a church, a baptistery was integrated into the south-eastern room. The dividing walls of the three chambers consisted of wood with the mortise holes in the stone walls still extant. Due to a conflagration that destroyed the interior furniture of the temple, the shape of the wooden walls is still visible as a dark shade on the stone walls. The floor was covered in sandstone floor panels, some of which were placed directly on the natural rock. A drainage system leading to a hole in the southern wall was inserted into the floor to prevent the temple interior from being flooded by rainwater. The temple was not the first structure on this location. Rebuilt stone elements with a curved shape in the north- eastern chamber as well as a relief in Banät Äd style dated to the eighth century ВС, are indications of an earlier building (Robin &amp; de Maigret 1998: 773-775, fig. 51; for comparisons see Audouin 1996: 121-142; Antonini 2004: 73-74; Gerlach 2005: 266). Bearing in mind the fact that the Great Temple of Yeha is not situated on the highest peak of the elevation but on a lower level, it is plausible that another sanctuary once stood where the modern church now stands (Krencker 1913: 78; Robin &amp; de Maigret 1998: 778). Fragments of Sabaean architectural decoration such as a pillar base in the area between the two walls of the church compound and an ibex frieze rebuilt in the modern church also suggest another sacred building adjacent to the Great Temple of Yeha.8 The aims of our recent work, aside from the archaeological and architectural documentation and research which includes terrestrial 3-D laser scanning 8 The ibex frieze can be generally compared to similar South Arabian friezes, e.g. those found in the "Almaqah temple of Sirwãh that are dated to the seventh century ВС (Schmidt 1982&lt;r. 128; Bleibtreu 1997: 20; Röring 2008: 136-137, 140; Kinzel &amp; Schnelle, in press). However, the ibex frieze can also be reconstructed as the decoration of the interior part of the Great Temple in Yeha.</page><page sequence="5">Yeha and Hawelti: cultural contacts between Saba 3 and DCMT 149 Figure 3.

The temple was most probably dedicated to 'Almaqah and can be identified as the one mentioned in the altar inscription of c Addi 3Akawah (Wolf &amp; Nowotnick 2010: 368-369, 371; Nebes 2010: 216-226). To determine its date and classification, comparison with other South Arabian temples seems logical. Rectangular temple buildings with a pillared propylon can be seen, for example, in the Bar3ãn Temple in Ma'rib. 10 There, a similar kind of division can be seen between the covered and open spaces inside both temples. In the Bar3ãn Temple the side aisles and rear side were covered, whereas the centre was open and the cella roofed. The arrangement of three chambers at the rear side of the Yeha building can also be found in Sabaean temples such as the Mahliyum Temple in Sirwäh and the sanctuary of Waddum &lt;Ju-Masmacim near Ma3rib.n Nevertheless, it is not only the architecture but also the building decoration at Yeha that is reminiscent of South Arabia: the uppermost part of the exterior wall of the temple in Yeha shows a double denticular frieze such as the 3Almaqah Temple in Sirwãh. Viewed against this background a date in the seventh century ВС and a designation as a Sabaean temple seem plausible.12 Grat Be'al Gebri in Yeha The second monumental ancient building in Yeha, named Grat Веэа1 Gebri, also reflects a connection with Saba3. It is located at a short distance from the Great Temple. Unfortunately, the building is in a poor state of preservation. After a rather small excavation by the Deutsche Axum-Expedition in 1906, it was examined in part in the 1970s by the Ethiopian Institute of Archaeology under the direction of F. Anfray.13 Our current investigations have determined its dimensions as at least 46 x 46 m. The building consists of a 4.5 m-high podium made of phonolithic ashlars with an interior chamber system. The exterior facade was interrupted by projections at the corners, as the excavation has shown in the north-western corner. The front of the building was adorned with a six- pillar propylon (Fig. 5). The bases and some remains of the pillars themselves are preserved. The stairs leading up to the propylon are mostly lost, and only rubble stone Figure 5. A view from the west towards the front of the Grat Be*al Gebri in Yeha with six pillar bases and parts of the stone door posts in 2009 after surface cleaning (I. Wagner, © DAI). 9 The terrestrial 3-D laser scans were made by the Labor fur Photogrammetrie und Laserscanning of the HafenCity Universität Hamburg, a cooperation partner of the Sanaa Branch of the DAI. See Lindstaedt et al. 2010. 10 The corresponding phase of the temple is dated to the fifth century ВС (Vogt 1998: 219-222; Schmidt 1999: 10-40; Vogt, Herberg &amp; Röring 2000). 11 The sanctuary in Sirwah can be dated to the late first millennium ВС (Gerlach &amp; Schnelle, forthcoming). The temple of Waddum çlCi- Masmacim stemmed from the eighth/seventh century ВС (Schmidt 19826: 91-99; 2007: 3-16). In addition, the Nakrah Temple in Baráqiš shows the combination of five aisles leading into five chambers at the rear end of the temple interior (de Maigret 2004). A detailed discussion of the complex of problems concerning Sabaean and/or Minaean models is in preparation. 12 The temple was dated by the French archaeological mission to the seventh or the sixth century ВС (Robin &amp; de Maigret 1998: 775-778). R. Fattovich favours a date between the seventh and the fifth centuries ВС on the basis of pottery assemblages (2009: 282). 13 Krencker 1913: 87-89. Unfortunately, a final report of the excavation results has not been published. See Anfray 1972: 49-52; 1973: 40-44; 1990: 27-30; 1997: 5-23.</page><page sequence="7">Yeha and Hawelti: cultural contacts between Saba э and ГУ MT 151 Figure 6.

Behind the propylon a huge gate with a narrow opening can be reconstructed; parts of the two massive stone doorposts are still extant. Behind the gate a vestibule gives access to a kind of corridor that crosses the building on the main axis. Visitors could probably reach the rooms on both sides by walking along the corridor. During excavations in the 1970s parts of these rooms were uncovered. The walls of the building on top of the podium were constructed in a timber framework consisting of wooden beams, rubble stones, and mud (Fig. 6). The beams were inserted horizontally, along the walls and penetrating into them. Unfortunately the building was destroyed by fire, which burnt up not only the wooden beams but also demolished the bond between the mud and the rubble stones. Thus, the walls are extant (as far as has been determined) only to a height of about 2 m. The upper part of the building, possibly a second storey in view of the almost 2 m-thick walls, and the ceiling are completely lost. The excavations of the Ethiopian Institute of Archaeology uncovered the floor in the vestibule and found negative impressions of wooden planking set into a kind of lime mortar (Anfray 1997: 12-13). The passage leading to the next room was rather narrow, where wooden door frames were added to the walls. In the next room to the west was a largely destroyed wooden pillar or column, which presumably served as a roof support. In future, the Sanaa Branch of the DAI intends not only to continue the excavation to resolve the dimensions of the podium and to draw up a ground plan of the building's interior structure, but also to test a restoration technique for conserving the timber framework walls. Fortunately some charcoal remains of the wooden beams were found during the excavations and samples were taken. The ,4C analysis supplies us with a date between the beginning of the eighth and the late sixth centuries ВС for the building on top of the podium.14 14 The results of the six ,4C samples, together with further samples, will be published soon. The charcoal samples were analysed by the Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory; the calibration was made with OxCal software. At the moment it is not possible to confirm whether the podium, the propylon, and the timber framework building belong to one</page><page sequence="8">152 Sarah Japp, Iris Gerlach, Holger Hitgen &amp; Mike Schnelle Figure 7. A view from the north-east towards the front facade of the five-pillar building in Sirwãh (Yemen) in 2009 (I. Wagner, ©DAI). In search of comparisons for the Grat Веэа1 Gebri, the five-pillar building in Sirwãh (Fig. 7) seems to be an appropriate example not only in terms of building technique but also in date. The five-pillar building situated in the north-western part of the ancient city of Sirwãh is composed of a travertine base and equipped with projections at the comers and in the middle of each side, while the building on top displays a timber framework system. However, unlike the Grat Веэа1 Gebri, the wooden beams were inserted horizontally as well as vertically at Sirwãh. The entrance to the building was adorned with a huge staircase leading up to a five-pillar propylon, behind which another staircase ascended to the door that was framed by huge stone posts. A corridor starting behind the door divided the interior into two halves and ended at a staircase which presumably led to a second storey. Six rooms were accessible from the corridor. All doors framed by wooden door jambs and lintels offered narrow passages such as found at Yeha. The five-pillar building in Sirwãh can be dated to the ninth century ВС based on 14C analysis.15 The function of the building remains unclear, as later changes destroyed the original interior. Some depressions at the entrance area, probably used for libations, seem to point to a sacred function. The function of the Grat Веэа1 Gebri is likewise unknown, although some miniature incense burners may also speak in favour of a sacred function. However, further examinations may help to reach a more detailed description of its function. The necropolis in Yeha During the survey that the Ethiopian-German team conducted in autumn 2009, a necropolis was found, and the same phase. Nevertheless, assigning the latter to the late first millennium BC (Fattovich 2009: 278-279) can be excluded in view of the I4C results. 15 The results gained thus far from the excavations in the five-pillar building in Sirwah are in preparation for publication in ABADY. The samples were analysed by the Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory; the calibration was made with OxCal software.

An aerial photograph of two rock-cut tombs in the °Abiy 3Addi necropolis near Yeha (I. Wagner, © DAI). situated on the hill slope of 3Abiy 3Addi opposite the Yeha settlement. Three rectangular depressions were still visible in the sloping grounds, where the native rock emerged. Local inhabitants of the area told the research team that they had found a shaft and a staircase in one of the tombs. Excavations carried out in spring 2010 unearthed three rock-cut tombs and three more were located. They consist of a 2.5 m-deep vertical shaft of rectangular shape with one grave chamber at each of their narrow sides. The entrances to the chambers were originally blocked by rectangular stone panels, which were lost in most cases. Other stone panels closed the shaft on the surface and the area was covered by a mound of stone rubble. A stone enclosure fenced in the tomb, but it could not be determined whether the enclosure was roofed or hypaethral (Fig. 8). The chambers, with differing sizes of up to 4 m in length and almost 1.2 m in height, were originally used for multiple burials, but unfortunately they were looted, probably in ancient times. Within the mud covering the floor of the chambers, displaced remains of skeletons were found as well as some broken parts of clay vessels and other grave goods such as beads. Further on, a later burial from the sixteenth century AD was discovered in one of the shafts. Comparable rock-cut tombs can be observed at another cemetery at the site, the so-called Southern Tombs or Tombs of Daaro-Mikael, excavated in the 1960s and 1970s by the Ethiopian Institute of Archaeology under the direction of F. Anfray (1963: 172-192; 1973: 39^0; 1990: 22-26). Seventeen tombs were opened. Some of them displayed a shaft with two burial chambers such as those in the new necropolis, while others seem to be more simple tombs. Inside the tombs not only skeletons but also several burial goods were found. Aside from pottery of different sizes and shapes (Fattovich 1977: 73; 1990: 9; 2009: 280-282), metal objects such as tools, weapons, vessels, seals, and jewellery as well as stone vessels and beads of different materials could be observed, providing an idea of the interior furniture of the necropolis on 3Abiy 3Addi. The tombs were dated by F. Anfray mainly</page><page sequence="10">between the fifth and fourth centuries ВС based on the finds (1990: 26). R. Fattovich instead preferred a date of the mid-first millennium ВС with two tombs being used in the late first to early second millennia AD (2009: 280). However, based on the latest research they probably stem from the seventh and sixth centuries ВС. The grave goods reflect South Arabian and indigenous traditions as well as unusual combinations such as bronze seals. Some of these show the typical Sabaean ibex closely connected to the state god 3Almaqah and Sabaean letters; however, this kind of object has no parallels in South Arabia. Rock-cut tombs do not have an equivalent in Saba3 until the first centuries AD. Known Sabaean tombs are mausolea such as the ones in the necropolis at the 3Awãm Temple in Ma'rib, outside the city wall in Sirwãh.16 The mausolea are tower-like structures with several storeys built of stone and used for multiple burials. Inscriptions on the tomb walls as well as stelae erected in the neighbourhood of the graves provide information about 154 Sarah Japp, Iris Gerlach, Holger Hitgen &amp; Mike Schnelle Figure 9. A view of the two pillar bases belonging to a rural sanctuary in the vicinity ofYeha, situated in the courtyard of a modern building (I. Wagner, © DAI). the deceased. Unfortunately the necropolis in Ma3rib was repeatedly robbed and stratified information on the grave goods is therefore meagre, although thousands of miniaturized vessels and objects made of clay, stone and metal together with jewellery and clay figurines were uncovered there (Gerlach 2002: 54-56; Japp 2002: 137- 147; O'Neill 2010: 207-209; in press). Rock-cut tombs with shafts and chambers were found, for example, in the neighbourhood of Zafar, which stem from the late Himyarite period (Yule 2007: 74-77). In Yeha local burial traditions such as rock-cut tombs were probably already in use before the Ethio-Sabaean kingdom of DCMT. Other ancient sites in Yeha and its surroundings Other representative buildings can be proposed in Yeha, based on the existence of pillar fragments and pillar bases discovered near the Great Temple. However, the exact position of these monuments remains unclear. Several remains of ancient settlements were found in the neighbourhood of Yeha, recognizable primarily by numerous potteiy fragments and stone rubble scattered on 16 Ma3rib: Hitgen 1998a: 247-249; Gerlach 2002: 41-58, see n. 11 for the bibliography; Röring 2002: 93-111.

A view from the south-east towards the western part of the stelae field in Hawelti (M. Schnelle, © DAI). the surface.17 The contemporary profane architecture, as far as we know, consists mainly of quarry stones and mud. Additionally, fragments of South Arabian inscriptions and remains of a third temple were reported. The latter is situated at the southern foothills of the elevation in the south-west of Yeha. Two bases of monumental pillars were found preserved in the courtyard of a modern house (Fig. 9) and another smaller one outside it. The two bases probably belonged to the propylon, while the third one could have been one of the pillars dividing the interior of the temple into different aisles. This temple located outside the settlement was probably a rural sanctuary. The stelae field in Hawelti Apart from investigating Yeha, the Ethiopian-German team has also been working in Hawelti. This site is located south-east of Axum on a flat hill near a large fertile plain (see Fig. 1). Excavations were carried out there in the 1950s by the Ethiopian Institute of Archaeology under the direction of H. de Contenson, during which several pillars (Fig. 10), one underground storeroom, and two buildings were exposed; the buildings were identified as temples (de Contenson 1959: 102-104; 1963: 41-52). Stone sculptures and a throne, the latter stylistically South Arabian, belonged to the temples (1959: 103; 1963: 42-43). During the 2010 spring campaign three pillar bases were uncovered and the process of their erection reconstructed. Deriving from a quarry only a few hundred metres away, each pillar was set into a building pit which was cut into the soft natural rock. The pillar was then fixed with the help of wedge stones and the pit was refilled with stone rubble. The upper part of every pillar is missing; it was probably cut off to use as building material in a later period. Of particular interest is the fact that all pillars have different measurements and traces of dressing. Therefore, the possibility that these pillars 17 Some of these settlements have already been published. See Anfray 1973: 44; Godet 1977: 19-58; Fattovich 1990: 3; Michels 2005.</page><page sequence="12">156 Sarah Japp, Iris Gerlach, Holger Hitgen &amp; Mike Schnelle belong to one architectural complex can be excluded (Fattovich 1990: 4) even though they are grouped more or less regularly around a natural depression (Fig. 10). In fact, we now propose that each pillar was an independent monument. The rectangular form, the stonemasonry, and incised Sabaean letters18 are typical South Arabian features, whereas the method of erection and the function seem to reflect indigenous elements. The stelae in Hawelti probably had a sacred, perhaps sepulchral function, even though there were no tombs below them as in Axum. Survey work in Hawelti revealed that the main settlement was situated on the north-eastern part of the hill. Although no buildings were visible on the surface, the concentration of pottery clearly displays the intensive utilization of this area. In addition, the fragment of a royal inscription was discovered, which again proves the connection to Saba3. Material culture The pottery found during the survey and in the excavations is definitely of local origin, which is attested not only by the clay and its temper but also by its shape and the treatment of the vessel's surface. Only a few vessels seem to have been imported or produced locally adopting a Sabaean model, e.g. the so-called torpedo- shaped jars or amphorae. Their distinct features are their shape, the sand-tempered clay, and the reddish-brown colour. They were recorded at different sites in South Arabia and Ethiopia dated between the eighth and sixth centuries ВС.19 According to G. Van Beek, these vessels were part of the trade between Saba3 and East Africa (1969: 92-93). However, as A. Porter has pointed out, the vessels were produced at different locations and cannot be used as proof of trade connections (2004: 261-275). Nevertheless, these jars document again the connections between Saba3 and the Abyssinian Highlands. Even when the vessels were manufactured in Ethiopia the idea of the shape most likely came from Saba3.20 Other vessels such as miniature goblets and bowls found in Hawelti are reminiscent of vessels unearthed in large numbers from the 3Awäm necropolis in Ma3rib (Japp 2002: 138-139, 141). Although the Ethiopian examples were obviously produced locally or regionally and display some differences in decoration, their idea could also have stemmed from South Arabia. The same situation can be observed in the terracotta figurines: in Saba3 depictions of women and dromedaries predominate (Hitgen 19986: 121-122; Gerlach 2002: 55- 56; O'Neill, in press), while in Hawelti several different zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines exist (de Contenson 1963: 43-44). Most of them do not show any similarities to the Sabaean figurines. However, the female figurines have some identical features such as a cylindrical body, applied breasts, and a bird-like head. Again it seems that local tradition was enriched with South-Arabian elements. New research concerning Ethio-Sabaean inscriptions is in the process of being carried out by N. Nebes, and for this reason only two elements will be briefly mentioned here. On the one hand the inscriptions clearly show the presence of the Sabaean pantheon (2010: 232). The Sabaean state god 3Almaqah is not only mentioned in some inscriptions, but three sanctuaries are proven epigraphically and archaeologically as dedicated to him.21 Yet 3Almaqah is not the only Sabaean god who is documented. Temples of other Sabaean gods are also known through inscriptions, although the buildings have yet to be located (2010: 232, n. 118). On the other hand, the use of the title mukarrib in the inscriptions reveals the adoption of the ruler nomenclature in the kingdom of DCMT (2010: 230-231). Thus, the political and religious connections between South Arabia and the Abyssinian Highlands are explicitly proved through such Ethio- Sabaean inscriptions. Conclusion South Arabian patterns can be seen repeatedly in the architecture of temples such as the Great Temple in Yeha, in the architecture of other representative buildings and structures such as the Grat Be3al Gebri in Yeha and the stelae field in Hawelti, in the adoption of the religious pantheon and certain cult practices, in the language and script, in the composition of the state system, and in Sabaean art in pottery, terracotta figurines, metal objects, 18 Unfortunately, the parts with the letters are now lost, but they are mentioned in the report by de Contenson (1963: 45). 19 For example in Ma3rib (Japp 2005: 70-71), Yala (de Maigret 1988: fig. 23/10-15), Hajar bin Humeid (Van Beek 1969: 170-171), Hajar Surbân (Breton 1998: 203, pl. 14), and Zabid (Ciuk &amp; Keall 1996: 20-21, pl. 95/1). Find spots in Ethiopia are mentioned too (Anfřay 1963: pl. 128; 1990: 49; Van Beek 1969: 170-171; Wolf &amp; Nowotnick 2010: 375). 20 The idea that these vessels originated in Ethiopia cannot be excluded. However, the frequency of torpedo-shaped jars in South Arabia and especially in areas of Sabaean predominance points to their invention in Saba3. Thus, the specimens found in the Abyssinian Highlands are imitations of South Arabian prototypes (Fattovich 2009: 286). 21 Aside from the temple in Yeha there is another one in Addi JAkawah (Wolf &amp; Nowotnick 2010: 377-378; Nebes 2010) and a third one in Gobochela (Leclant 1959: 44-52).</page><page sequence="13">Yeha and Hawelti: cultural contacts between Saba 3 and DCMT 157 and stone sculptures. It does not seem likely that such foreign elements can be attributed only to the presence of individuals or small groups (see e.g. Fattovich 2004: 74; 2009: 269-270; Phillipson 2009: 287). Merchants and tradesmen do not leave the same social, political, religious, and cultural changes as do settlers, especially when they encounter an agriculturally organized society without script.22 Therefore, the migration of larger Sabaean groups across the Red Sea into the Abyssinian Highlands can be assumed. The reason for this migration is still unknown. Yet, especially during the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Saba3 was an expanding state and its policy was not only to conquer, but also to settle Sabaean people in occupied areas. However, other motivations are also possible such as trade in raw materials. The Sabaeans founded an autonomous realm designated DCMT, which was independent of its home country Saba3. An acculturation process between immigrating Sabaeans and the local population took place rapidly as the architecture and objects clearly show. Foreign elements were not just copied but were adapted to display a unique local style. A region- wide adoption of these features is not recognizable at the moment, although given the above evidence such an adoption is not really necessary to define the connections between the Horn of Africa and South Arabia and the realm of the Ethio-Sabaean kingdom of DCMT.

Nevertheless, they were influenced by South Arabian culture in the worship of the Sabaean pantheon and inclusion in the state system. Thus, the absence of these elements in agricultural settlements in the Abyssinian Highlands is not totally surprising and does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that only the indigenous elite presented South Arabian components in their manifestations of power (Fattovich 1990: 19).
