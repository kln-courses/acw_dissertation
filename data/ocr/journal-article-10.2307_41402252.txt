<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lucia Perillo From the Bardo Zone HERE rain and in the not-rain- country's the top year left s corner, cyclical where passage there is punctuated are only two by seasons fish. Sure, - rain and not-rain- the year s cyclical passage is punctuated by fish. Sure, there is summer, when the lawns green blades turn into dry bristles, and there is also winter with its white peaks, the mountains revealed on those rare days when the clouds give up some portion of their hold on the horizon. But these are only the year s commas and hyphens, not the exclamation mark at the end of its paragraph. For that kind of rousing finale you need a streambed littered with dead fish. For me, here's how it goes: come November I drive a few miles outside of my small city, where a logging road zigzags through a clear-cut where some- times elk wander. Theres a brutal quality to the light that fills the clear-cut - it reveals the force of the human stamp on a place whose natural tendency would be to fill its empty spaces. But the road ends where the forest again closes in, around a clearing where squats a portable toilets blue plastic box. From here the trail heads into the mostly Douglas firs that border Kennedy Creek. Its a location that falls pretty much in the middle of the spectrum of pos- sible wildernesses. At one end of the spectrum might be a place like Seattles Ballard Locks, where salmon move up a mazelike series of concrete steps, and visitors watch from a concrete bunker underground whose one wall is made of plate glass. When the fish swim by, viewers see them as if on a wide-screen tv. Proximity substitutes for the complete sensual picture. You can look into a salmons nostril but you won't hear the thrash of the uphill fight. And you don't get the display of their extravagant deaths, which will take place later on the breeding grounds upstream. Kennedy Creek is only a five-miles-from-town, portable-toilet kind of wilderness, but it doesn't hold back when it comes to the sensuality of death. [899]</page><page sequence="2">900 THE GEORGIA REVIEW As soon as I get out of the car the first scent to hit me is that of fish oil mixed with the peculiar sweetness of rotting meat. The trail has been upgraded recently to a swath of black crushed rock, and there are signboards to fill in the salmon's backstory as well as to tell me how to comport myself: Do not wander from the trail. Keep your voice down. Apparently the water hears us just as we hear it. What it sounds like is a washer swishing back and forth, the power cut- ting off then starting up again at a particularly explosive point in the laundry cycle. Less than a hundred yards from the parking lot there's a footbridge over a subthread of the creek, where the journeys of many of the fish terminate. Here the live chum salmon loiter in the company of the dead, which outnumber them two to one. This year the water level is high and so the fish have traveled further into the forest than I have ever seen them. The creek's tributaries plunge down the vegetated slope, and these notches are so steep and so scantly filled with water that it hardly seems possible the fish could have ascended them. Such disbelief is the spectacle's human quotient. Looking down from the bridge, I can see the living salmon mustering their resources in the creek's foot-deep pockets. Then they hurl themselves up on the gravel bars over which flows maybe only an inch of water. They propel themselves with their fins, their bodies wholly in the air, and not the slow wriggle one might expect but instead a spurt constructed from brute force and will. Their shoulders - but of course they do not have shoulders - heave the rest of their bodies forward until they reach another pocket deep enough to swim in again. There's no hesitation once they decide to make a run for it. I see none who change their minds, give up, and head back, though often it seems their jaunts will leave them stranded. I watch a male battle his way upstream though I can see he'll be trapped by a stick that has fallen with one end in the water and one end on the bank. He noses at this solid wall that blocks his upstream passage. He swims in place with the undulating movements of a snake. After five minutes of dinking around in the crotch of the stick, he finally heaves himself over it, even though it rests halfway out of the water. Luckily for him, the effort frees him back into the main channel of the stream. It's a lot to observe, these dramas in the creek, the many courtships aris- ing amid the many dead. Fish hunker in the creek, a female and her would-be suitors quivering side by side. The dominant male will lunge over her back, weaving around her in a gymnastic, pommel horse sort of foreplay, fending off</page><page sequence="3">LUCIA PERILLO 901 any other male who attempts to intrude. She will have used a humping motion of her body to create a slight depression in the stones. Waiting beside her may also be other young males whove adopted the coloration of female fish, in the hope of sneaking undetected past their bigger and more combative rivals. If everything goes according to plan, shell drop her eggs and then a male will fertilize them with the cloudy substance of his milt. Then death will set in, however contrary to Darwin it seems: this strange twining of sex and death. Other species, like steelhead, do not always die after they breed, and so it seems there is an altruism in the salmons many deaths. They are animate tankers, ferrying particles from the ocean to this semiurban forest. Traces of their carcasses have shown up in 137 other vertebrate species. The world is made of dead stuff- anyone who's walked in the fallen leaves knows that- but dead animals we feel compelled to bury, we humans who admit into our presence so few reminders of our own mortality. The spent fish twirl in the water, whitening. It is hard to tell if they are breathing, or if the gills movement is just a flutter caused by the current. The fish who die in the water tend to lose their skin like scarves, and then the flesh similarly peels off. The carcasses that have ended up on land (has the water level dropped? or was the carcass dragged by an animal? or did the fish somehow crawl off to its death like a wounded soldier?) often lie curled in a crescent, the dry fins brittle as potato chips, the fin-edges shredded by whatever battles got them here. The trail drops down a clay bank and ends at the edge of the main channel of the creek, a clear and shallow laminar flow moving over the round stones. The water levels being so high masks the presence of the fish, but I can see their backs intermittently breaking through the surface at the margins of the creek. Someone has left a female and a male carcass here for contrast, the trails final instructive tableau. In the water, a chum salmons sides are brightly marked with purple streaks that resemble bruises. Dry, though, their colors are less remarkable than their forms. The male has a large hump on his back, a more aggressive mien. Not that the female doesn't have more than an adequate number of sharp teeth. But the males jaws are outsized, a transformation that took place as he swam up here, as his body readied itself for breeding's violent work. However, these two fish, left nose to nose, are not what most snags my attention. On the far bank there's a stump broken off a good four feet from the ground. And balanced on top, with its rigid body curled, there's a salmon. Of</page><page sequence="4">902 THE GEORGIA REVIEW course I start wondering how it came to be there - a drop in the water level, an itinerant bear? Or could it have fallen from the talons of an eagle? Could so random an accident have brought the fish to land so precisely on a ragged stump? No, I decide, no accidents here; everything is scripted - the salmon gov- erned by memories and maps that are somehow coded in their neural circuits. As the crow flies, we are not so far from the ocean. But to travel there by water would mean swimming past a dozen cities. And a dozen dozen watersheds, each cataclysmically altered by the twentieth century. In this ravaged water- scape, a fish must find its way to the ocean and then find its way back, lhe very complexity of such a system conspires against its continuing in an age that favors the monocultural crop, the half-hour sitcom, the drive-thru burger joint, the big- volume discount store. So no, no accidents here, and the salmon perched high on a stump seems to have been put there to take our intellects down a peg. After half a century of study, we still don't know how they navigate to and from the sea, and it humbles us because, if there's one thing we do know, it is that if we lived in their shoes- okay, their fins- we could not replicate this feat. In photographs taken by Scott Chambers, a former commercial fisherman, the mostly dead salmon look up at us with eyes that seem to be made out of bright foil. These are humpback salmon, also called pinks, also called rags because of their comparatively mushy flesh. Solidity is not one of their bodies defining traits, and often in the photographs the fishs body appears to be half fused with the rushing water. Chambers has named these photographs the Bardo series, from Bardo Thodol , which is the Tibetan title of what English speakers have tradition- ally called The Tibetan Book of the Dead. A more accurate translation is what scholar Robert Thurman makes the subtitle of his version: the book of natural liberation through understanding the in-between. It's not death that is the book's true subject, but that amorphous estuary that is no longer life and not yet death. One of the photos translates this between-ness into the literal language of bones and flesh. A dead fish lies on the gravel, the rear half of its skin shrugged loose like a garment, from which the spine extrudes in a compressed arc until it joins up with the head. The purging of the flesh is incomplete though; only half of the bones have achieved that state of incandescent whiteness that emerges in</page><page sequence="5">LUCIA PERILLO 903 the late stage of its rot. For now, the fish is something for which we do not have a name, something in between a carcass and a skeleton. And the namelessness sits awkwardly on us who are used to having things one way or the other: you're a man or a woman, you drive to work on one side of the road and drive home on the other. You can see why the system has its advantages. Theres a survival value in avoiding the head-on crash. With my human mind I can t help speculating about what passes in the minds of those who lie immobile, languishing, their color drained but the gills still moving. It seems likely they have some form of understanding that their bodies are no longer functioning as they once did, an understanding that the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio might categorize not as consciousness but as emotion. Damasio offers the example of the marine snail Aplysia to support his contention that even a primitive creature will give some bodily indication of an emotion such as fear. Touch the snails gill and its heart rate shoots up, ink will shoot out. The snail may not be able to do the processing of these emotions (which is what would turn emotion into something more akin with human feeling), but their presence is necessary to guide the actions the creature will need to make in order to survive. Its emotion, claims Damasio, that enables us to read our environment and keep ourselves alive. So I wonder how the living salmon read the water in which float the corpses of their comrades. They must have a perception of at least the basic physical properties of their immediate environment, the depletion of oxygen caused by so much decaying matter. And surely the spawned-out fish experi- ences a host of symptoms like lassitude, dysfunction, and maybe pain. I dont believe they "think" about these symptoms, but some registering of them must be present, as this recognition is after all what enabled the fish to survive its younger days in a series of complex environments. Damasio calls consciousness, conscience, spirit, and soul "one big region of strangeness" that sets humans apart from other animals, and what has in theory been our monopoly on these theological/ethical/cognitive zones also has given us a sense of entitlement in our governance of other creatures. Hence our right to eat them, to manipulate their habitats, to use them in experiments that will with any luck lead to cures for our diseases. And believe me, I do want those cures. But it is hard to look into one of the bright foil eyes of the Bardo photographs and emerge from that confrontation still believing that soul and spirit are strangenesses to which only the human species can lay claim.</page><page sequence="6">904 THE GEORGIA REVIEW In another photograph we see what looks like an organized phalanx of fish, more than a dozen moving as a regiment against a substrate of leaves. But something about the fishs coloration is not right, their backs pale and their undersurfaces darker, and then you realize that their dorsal fins are not dorsal fins at all. Instead its the pectoral fins, the ones near the gills, that are breaking through the water. The fish are floating upside down, barrel-rolled by the air bladders in their stomach cavities. There is something frightening about them, frightening because they are beyond our reach. Biologists speak of "managing" a living resource, interven- ing in the natural history of a creature to make it more compatible with human life. But this army of dead salmon is not listening to us anymore: its as if death has inoculated them against our interventions. In her poem number 1691 Emily Dickinson coins her own word for the deads ungovernable nature: The overtakelessness of those Who have accomplished death Majestic is to me beyond The majesties of Earth. The soul her "Not at Home" Inscribes upon the flesh - And takes her fair aerial gait Beyond the hope of touch. Here, as in The Book of the In-between , death is work. And those who have succeeded at the task can no longer be overtaken by us who remain locked in our gravity-bound flesh. In Dickinsons version of deaths conversions of the body, the soul then gambols off into the sky - and it is curious how many artistic renderings of spawned-out salmon show them inhabiting the medium of air, as though they no longer float in the water because they have become substances made of breath. "Ghost salmon," one might say, just as, looking at spawned-out fish in the real world of the real wild, they do seem to glow with the spectral quality of ghosts. In the cases of some dead fish this analogy makes visual sense, as they are often covered with a white fungus that resembles snow. In one of the Bardo photographs the fungal fish hangs in a riffle of whitewater, its pose a mimic of that with which it fought its way upstream.</page><page sequence="7">LUCIA PERILLO 905 In his book Totem Salmon , Freeman House, another former commercial fisherman, sees the metaphor of the ghost playing out in the salmons natural history, not just in the individual fish, but also in the salmon population as a whole. House reminds us of the pains that we call phantoms when they inhabit the missing limbs of amputees, evidence of the nervous systems remembrance of the part that has been lost. Likewise the environment "remembers" those species which have been cut from it. Theorizes House: The local field of being that we call the ecosystem must experience a period of adjustment when one of its organisms has disappeared - even if the disappearance has occurred over a period of time beyond human understanding. When people, accidentally or purposefully, experience engagement with these fields of being, the direct, ineffable sense of the ghosts of lost creatures may come visiting. The ghosts are globes of emptiness floating through the bloodstream of life, nearly lost memories of the void left by some absent life form. Ecosystem absences can become palpable presence, a weird stillness moving against the winds of existence and leaving a waveform of per- turbation behind. This interpretation of the depleted world wouldn't be lost on the Tibetans, in whose scheme of things, as we are born and die and are born and die again, we ping-pong between realms that include humans, animals, and ghosts (and also hells and demigods and gods). It is easy to conceive of a Buddhist ether where globes of emptiness float around waiting to be filled by consciousnesses whose body- vessels have run their course. We snag a globe on the fly and are born into our next life, and the Bardo Thodol is a how-to manual on navigating what it calls "the terrors" that will face us between lives. What the book contains is a series of prayers to be read to the person who has knocked on deaths door and now waits for death to answer. Though one of the books operative words is compassion , it also insists above all that the task of death be approached with a clear head. In Robert Thurmans translation the prayers have all the briskness of a military drill: Hey! Now when the life between dawns upon me, I will abandon laziness, as life has no more time . . . This once that Ive obtained the human body is not the time to stay on the path of distractions.</page><page sequence="8">906 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Elsewhere the imperatives are even more forthright, reminding me of nothing so much as that point in old movies when the hero is momentarily overtaken by hysteria and someone with a cooler head has to deliver a slap to each of his cheeks. "Hey Noble One! Listen Without Wavering! " is the common opener to the prayers, which are to be read to the one who traverses the land- scape of the in-between so that his/her mind doesn't run the risk of "riding the horse of breath like a feather blown on the wind, spinning and fluttering." In truth I don't know if I could handle having the Book of the In-between read to me if I were dying. The hierarchy of its afterlife seems another order of magnitude more complicated than life itself, and life itself possesses a degree of complexity that Ì barely feel equipped to negotiate. And then there is also the frightening aspect of its metaphysics, with fierce deities such as Yama the naked hard-on'd blue-black fire-breathing buffalo-riding god of the underworld. But one of its more reassuring aspects is how it puts the dying mind in the driver's seat. Be fiercely courageous! is my favorite of its exhortations. Salmon are so totemically identified with the Northwest that viewing their runs is one of the inaugurating rites for new citizens of the region. Another rite might involve buying whole fish cheaply at the Indian reservation's tent stand and grilling them on the barbecue. There are seven indigenous Oncorhynchus species here and most of them have several names - so another rite of immigration is mastering the lingo: coho sockeye humpy chum. And is it just a coincidence that this happens to be a near-homonym for the chant that is a Buddhist mainstay? От mani padme hum, which Thurman says means "all is well with the universe, the force of good and love is everywhere and competent to help all beings out of every difficulty." A nice idea, though I don't know if I buy it. Stubbornly I cling to the material realm: coho sockeye humpy chum! Eating salmon is a morally troubling act, because the fishing industry has hurt so many of their populations. And a person doesn't even have to eat salmon to be a destructive force. The houses we live in are made from trees that once shaded salmon streams, and the dead limbs of those trees once kept carcasses from being swept downstream. The forest that's been cleared to accommodate us once prevented dirt from muddying those streams. The electricity it takes to run the laptop that I write this on comes from dams that block their migratory routes; the runoff from the roads we drive on is full of toxic gook. The very act of moving here was probably the worst turn I ever</page><page sequence="9">LUCIA PERILLO 907 did for the fish, as their numbers have dropped in inverse proportion to the burgeoning of the regions human population. Against the damaged world I have sandbagged myself with guilt. Originally I came to the Northwest to work as a park ranger, but after one particularly arduous summer I noticed that something strange was hap- pening to the physical me. I had no diagnosis and yet I knew my body was changing - its muscles had become unreliable, as if they were no longer fully solid. Now my arm would sometimes act like an arcade crane that has trouble grabbing even the lightest toy. And my legs turned rubbery, or a jolt of electric- ity would sometimes travel down their lengths. That was fifteen years ago. A couple of months later the doctor showed me pictures of my brain dotted with white spots, which glowed as brightly on the magnetic-resonance images as the fungus on a fish. Multiple sclerosis, he said - a disease whose name has no pleasing euphonic qualities. And though my acquisition of debilities has been slow, it often has seemed, over the past decade and a half, as though I inhabited a liminal region that was a twilit ver- sion of "normal" living. But maybe this is a form of self-aggrandizement, seeing oneself as a walking (or not walking) member of the dead. Now when I go out to Kennedy Creek, I have to ride the trail on an electric scooter, which is more or less a material form of euphemism for a wheelchair. I am glad for the chance to let my physical self dissolve into the wind and the trees, but other human spectators keep reminding me that the trees are they and I am me, a hunk of meat with no stamina for the wilderness. Don t get me wrong; Im grateful for the people who push me out when I bog down in the mud. But it drives me crazy when someone tries to take me aside (that is, if you can take someone on a motorized vehicle aside) to say: I think its great someone like you is out here. Someone like me, meaning not like them, and thus do I get corroboration about inhabiting the bardo zone. Meanwhile the gulls squawk from the trees: the scrap! the scrap! They too do not belong here in the canopied forest. Giving me the hairy eyeball, as if they want to strip a tendon off of me. Scientists don t really know how salmon navigate: the smell of the birth-stream appears to be crucial, but olfactory recognition would not explain how salmon operate once they get out of sniffing range. I think of our not-knowing as another sort of bardo zone, in that not-knowing forces us to abandon categories and slots, especially if we expect our minds to happen on a genuine discovery.</page><page sequence="10">90S THE GEORGIA REVIEW Freeman House grapples with the mystery of salmon by concluding that the best way to come to terms with it is by means of contemplation: Reductionist science attempts to understand the lives of salmon in separation from their field of being, the living sea. And we don t have the intellectual or perceptual tools to consider the interactions in a milieu so different from our own . . . If our engagement with natural processes is beyond our ability to measure and quantify in the laboratory, it may be that the only way to immerse ourselves in those processes is through the long practice of cumulative attentiveness. In the close-mouthed world of reciprocal perception, there is no way to learn to live in place but from the place itself. Even the waters can teach us, if we can quiet our appetite for "rational" explanation. In lieu of this kind of quiet, most of us attempt to come to terms with the mind of the salmon by metaphorizing their navigational abilities in terms of our own way- finding inventions. But of course salmon don t have compasses or maps, only the mysterious receptor that is their body, which is able to measure, in the words of House, "the buzz and pulse of electromagnetic fields and cur- rents, infinitesimally minute differences in temperature and salinity and light and food." Some day we may figure out how the body registers these properties, but the mind that processes this information will likely remain elusive. Chuang Tzu, the Taoist poet from some time around the third century b.c., made mans interaction with the natural world his chief subject of study. His poem "The Joy of Fishes" comprises a dialectic on the subject of mans attributing human emotions to animals. In Thomas Mertons translation it begins: Chuang Tzu and Hui Tzu Were crossing Hao river by the dam. Chuang said: "See how free The fishes leap and dart: That is their happiness." A debate ensues about how Chuang can know whether or not the fish are happy, and the poem ends with Chuang winning the debate by insisting on Hui s precision of speech:</page><page sequence="11">LUCIA PERILLO 909 "What you asked me was 'How do you know what makes fishes happy?' From the terms of your question You evidently know I know What makes fishes happy. "I know the joy of fishes In the river Through my own joy, as I go walking Along the same river." What I like about this poem is how it tells us that its okay to cut ourselves some slack when it comes to our habit of anthropomorphism. All any of us can know is our own mind, and Chuang Tzu is suggesting that it should be obvious that when we make a statement about the minds of animals we are really talking about ourselves. What is obvious about the people who come to Kennedy Creek is that they too are seized by joy. No mere sign can keep children from squealing, and even adult visitors are liable to give out cries that have been forged by their amazement. Fleetingly I get the sense we should not be here, trampling the bank and transforming the woods into a sort of piscine Disneyland. But staying home would be another form of betrayal, because it would be too easy then to put the fish out of our minds. And it is also good that we be reminded that the stink and decay we generally find abhorrent also have their place. By now the Northwest has seen more than a decade of legal wrangling over whether twenty-six populations of salmon should be on the federal list of species that are threatened or endangered. At issue is the distinction between wild fish and those reared in hatcheries, which have churned out salmon in this country since the late nineteenth century. Such was the industrial eras faith in technology that its fixes, such as hatcheries, were seen as perfectly adequate substitutions for wild systems that evolved over the course of thousands of years. Of course each technological fix usually breeds new glitches - such as the various behaviors of hatchery fish that leave them vulnerable to living in the wild. And so it would seem crucial to the species long-term survival to pre- serve the genetic diversity of wild fish, the populations of some unique stocks of which have dwindled to less than a hundred fish, their genes a mystery not</page><page sequence="12">910 THE GEORGIA REVIEW yet unraveled. But many years of interbreeding have already taken place, and so, genetically, wild salmon inhabit a bardo zone, a state of being neither this nor that, neither hatchery produced nor fully wild, a threshold from which biologists hope to coax them back by building up wild populations. The natural world has a way of backlashing when technology attempts to meddle, and the environmental movement of the past century was founded on cases where the industrial world s blind faith in itself caused the balance of nature to go awry. And because scorning technology was one of the poses of my young adulthood, it is ironic and painful to me that I find myself so completely lashed to the man-made world. Now my presence at Kennedy Creek requires a hundred pounds of plastic and metal and toxic chemicals, a battery-powered juggernaut that can roll only across terrain that has been cleared. I know I am only one small woman trammeling the wilderness. Still, it grieves me that I do trammel. What I would embrace, I crush. I don t know how I feel about the whole idea of karma. On the one hand it makes me sort of edgy to think that my body s hard luck might be due to the fact that in some former life I was a major bitch. And so it is almost spooky: how salmon put the karma hypothesis into physical form. The dead ones molecules scatter, to become maybe part of those 137 other species. That is both thrilling and hopeful to me, the idea that someday some molecule of me could be incorporated into the agile body of a coyote. Or something not even so glamorous, like a long-tailed weasel. Or a Copes giant salamander. Or a glaucous-winged gull. Because I wanted to finish this essay in situy I drove my VW van out to Ken- nedy Creek. The March sky was gray, but with enough bright white patches to make me squint as I drove west. The carcasses would all be gone by now, or so I assumed: I wanted to see if they'd left any traces. I am not sure how quickly fish bones dissolve. And was the stump with the salmon unadorned by now? Or had the fish skull turned it into a frightful totem? A half mile off the highway I found the logging road all right, but the gate was locked across its mouth. A few cars parked there told me people were hiking in, so I pulled off the shoulder and shut off the van. I had to park facing the wrong way because otherwise the drainage ditch would make it impossible for me to put down my lift. If a car came along the road too fast, the scooter and I would find ourselves in the driver s teeth.</page><page sequence="13">LUCIA PERILLO 9II And then there was also the obstacle of the gate: I could see that people had made a trail around it. Unfortunately the trail went over a muddy hump that I knew the mechanical me had only half a chance of climbing. I sat there a long time, thinking. About bodies and danger, about salmon and death, about dams made surmountable by concrete fish ladders, and the insurmountable wild. About the pull that makes the salmon come back here. And then, in a very un-Buddhist-like mood, I cursed a time or two before I headed back to town. Sources Cederholm, Jeff, et al.
