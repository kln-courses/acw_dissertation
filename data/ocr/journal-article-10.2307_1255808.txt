(V. geneal. charts). n.p. PERHAPS in no branch of ethnography is the weakness of work done through interpreters more keenly felt by an enquirer ignorant of his informants' language than in the collection of folktales. The mere attempt to appreciate a form of art without an adequate knowledge of the medium in which it is expressed seems to border on impertinence; and those of us who have had to make the attempt, faute de mieux, know well the distor- tion and the impoverishment which it entails. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to miss any opportunity of recording Indian material; and we must recognise that aptitude for learning and using a foreign language is more commonly found among American Indians than among white Americans. Dr. Parsons,</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. 335 in this collection of Kiowa tales made in a few weeks and through interpreters, has done all that could be done in the circumstances. She has the experience to enable her to judge the competence of the various interpreters, and the wide comparative knowledge,-especially on the side of ceremonial organization,-which is necessary to check probabilities and keep the less conscientious interpreters in the straight path. The Kiowa now in Oklahoma have many obvious affinities with the Plains tribes. They used to be in intimate contact with the Crow, from whom, about 1765, they adopted the Sun Dance. But they had also many south-western contacts, with the Pawnee, the Comanche, the Apache, and the Pueblo Indians. J. P. Harrington has shown a close linguistic con- nection between the Kiowa and the Tanoan (Pueblo) group. In the stories here collected these various contacts are so well represented that the collection may be reckoned a fair sample of the whole body of Kiowa folktale. The tales are in the majority of Plains type, (as are the descriptions of ceremonial and the ritual allusions); "Wolf Boy," for example, is a conflation of two Cheyenne stories. But several Kiowa variants of Plains tales are also found among the Pueblos, three of these being, Dr. Parsons notes, of Spanish origin (p. xv). The incidents in which figure " Split Boys " and their spider grand- mother have a strong Pueblo flavour. Dr. Parsons suggests a social mechanism for the transfer of such elements from the Plains to the Pueblos, namely the existence of the Pueblo Clown Societies, as derivatives of the Plains type of military- police societies (p. xiii). For movement in the other direction we have the mechanism of trade and visiting, both ancient and modern. In the Kiowa tales Coyote appears as a sun-stealer (not fire- stealer); but Sen'deh, an anthropomorphic culture hero, the prototype of humanity, both powerful and comic, takes the place of Coyote in most of the tales and " has a paramountcy in Kiowa tale and life such as is never attained by Coyote among the Pueblos "(p. xvi). " Sen'deh story " is the term applied not only to the tales in which he figures but to tales in general. Myths or ritual-justifying tales are distinguished as " true</page><page sequence="3">336 Reviews. stories " from " lie or joke stories " : " Split Boys," for instance) belongs to the keepers of the tsaidetali bundles, who tell it at their spring ceremony (p. xvii). Tales begin with " There was a camp," or " Sen'deh was coming, or going." Dr. Parsons raises (p. xix) the interesting question of negative inference from folktales. Some of the most conspicuous features of Kiowa life have no place in these tales,-the Sun Dance, referred to only once; the war societies, the camp- circle bands, avoidance and joking relationships, courtship and marriage, vows, fasting, never mentioned. Is it because some customs " are too recent to have got into the tales or too obsolescent to have stayed in them " ? " Or is it more to the point that the tale-patterns, particularly where the number is limited as among the Kiowa, may not lend themselves to the mention of certain customs however deepseated and ubiquitous ? " A custom which is not itself the subject of tales may be assumed as an obvious background: thus, Kiowa and Pueblo Indians both have the whimsical tale of the Little Mice and their Dance; only, the Tewa mice dance t'e yemuge, while the Kiowa mice dance the Sun Dance. After the folktales come some interesting narratives of intertribal relations, some narratives of personal and ceremonial life, two or three genealogies, and some notes on kinship terms and personal names.
