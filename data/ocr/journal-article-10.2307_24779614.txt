<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy By Gary Geddes In the final pages of The Rescue, Hassim's faithful messenger, Jaffir, wounded and dying, struggles through mud and the debris of wood and bodies, all that is left of Lingard's dream on the Shore of Refuge, to deliver his master's final words to King Tom. No thoughts of delay or failure enter his mind, for the simple reason that "there is no rest for the messenger until the message is delivered."1 Conrad, if we are to believe the record of agonies and setbacks revealed in his letters, must have felt something like this about the message that he hoped to deliver in The Rescue, that novel which took more than twenty years to complete. As early as 1896, Conrad wrote to 'Joseph Conrad, The Rescue (London, 1946, 1955), p. 447. All references to Conrad's works are to the Collected Edition of the Works of Joseph Conrad, published by J. M. Dent, and will be abbreviated and incorporated into the text as follows: (R, p. 447).</page><page sequence="2">108 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy Edward Garnett about his troubles with The Rescue, then known as The Rescuer. He claimed to have written only one page in over a week, pro nouncing it a "fine torture" to be "able to think but unable to express."2 With no end in sight, except to his patience, Conrad tried to assess his difficulties. "Now I've got all my people together," he explained, "I don't know what to do with them. The progressive episodes will not emerge from the chaos of my sensations" (LL, I, p. 192). He complained of his lack of a framework, or peg, upon which to hang his ideas: Other writers have some starting point. Something to catch hold of. They start from an anecdote—from a newspaper paragraph (a book may be suggested by a casual sentence in an old almanack), they lean on dialect—or on tradition—or on history—or on the prejudice or fad of the hour; they trade upon some tie or conviction of their time—or upon the absence of these things—which they can abuse or praise. But at any rate they know something to begin with—while I don't. I have had some impressions, some sensations—in my time;—impressions and sensations of common things. And it's all faded—my very being seems faded and thin like the ghost of a blonde and sentimental woman, haunting romantic ruins pervaded by rats. I am exceedingly miserable. My task seems to me as sensible as lifting the world without that fulcrum which even that conceited ass, Archimedes, admitted to be necessary. (LL, I, p. 192) Although he had written The Nigger of the "Narcissus" while still struggling with The Rescuer, Conrad felt that he was losing his creative powers when ever he took up the unfinished work; "I seem to have lost all sense of style and yet I am haunted, mercilessly haunted, by the necessity of style. And that story I can't write weaves itself into all I see. . . . My story is there in a fluid— in an evading shape. I can't get hold of it. It is all there—to bursting, yet I can't get hold of it, any more than you can grasp a handful of water" (LL, I, p. 232). In the midst of his frustration, of course, there is the determination to hang on: "The fact however remains that this Rescue makes me miserable—frightens me—and I shall not abandon it—even temporarily. I must get on with it, and it will destroy my reputation. Sure!" (LL, I, p. 237). Conrad did abandon The Rescue more than temporarily. And when he took it up again he seems to have been temperamentally and artistically ready to see the job through to its completion. In the Author's Note to The Rescue, he claims to have had to wait for "the proper formula of expression, the only formula that would suit" (viii) before he could finish the novel. This remark sounds too much like his earlier emphasis on the need for an appro priate style to be ignored. As he had said to Garnett: "In the matter of Rescue I have lost all sense of form and I can't see images. But what to write I know. I have the action, only the hand is paralyzed when it comes to giving expression to that action" (LL, I, p. 237). It would be impossible to state precisely the source of this new formula of expression, for which Conrad had to wait twenty years. Perhaps his emotional immersion in the 2G.

Whatever truth there might be in such speculations, it seems clear that an examination of "style" or "expression" is most likely to provide a door into the densely populated and exotically coloured pages of The Rescue, to deliver the message so long pondered and so carefully composed. In The Rescue there are a number of linguistic elements that are struc turally important, that are fundamental to the patterning of the novel. I am referring to those words or phrases that, by virtue of being repeated often in related contexts, have assumed a special significance in my own under standing of The Rescue. This peculiar community of words, of which the key phrase is perhaps "diplomacy," is associated with the field of human activity commonly called manners. The Rescue is not a comedy of manners at all; in fact, it might more accurately be called a tragedy of manners. In this novel Conrad is concerned to explore the relation between the sensible exterior of human behaviour—such elements as dress, gesture, speech, eti quette—and the psychology which underlies human action. In the final chapter of The Rescue Edith Travers announces to her husband that she intends to meet Tom Lingard on the sandbank, even if it means paying the utmost farthing of her debt to her strange rescuer. Her husband dismisses the possibility as a matter of no consequence: "Really it doesn't matter what you decide to do. All this is of so little importance" (R, p. 456). Edith is shocked to discover that her husband can respond to this momentous decision in her life with such apparent indifference; then she realizes that he is using his illness as an excuse for taking no positive action, such as making a scene or forbidding her to go. "He's making the most of it," she finally concludes. "It's a matter of diplomacy" (R, p. 456). This awareness comes to Edith, who, except for her brief encounter with Lingard and his simple, heroic world, has spent all her life immersed in such diplomacy, "without irony, bitterness, or disgust" (R, p. 456); it comes to her only with a certain sinking of the heart at the recognition that she is once again back in the artificial world of the Hermit, where honest speech and plain-dealing are not major considerations. Travers' diplomacy consists of bluffing, or face-saving; it is a mask for mere cowardice or dishonesty. The word "diplomatic" occurs frequently in The Rescue, but first in refer ence to Hassim and the qualities necessary to the successful Wajo trader: "And with those people trading, which means also travelling afar, is a romantic and an honourable occupation. The trader must possess an adventurous spirit and a keen understanding; he should have the fearlessness of youth and the sagacity of age; he should be diplomatic and courageous, so as to secure the favour of the great and inspire fear in evil-doers" (R, p. 67). The ideal trader, the narrator says, carries "important news as well as merchandise," "secret messages and valuable goods," and so must be "as ready to intrigue and fight as to buy and sell" (R, p. 68). This description of</page><page sequence="4">110 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy one kind of diplomacy is followed by an account of the part played by the Wajo traders in "all those national risings, religious disturbances, and also in the organized piratical movements on a large scale which, during the first half of the last century, affected the fate of more than one native dynasty and, for a few years at least, seriously endangered the Dutch rule in the East" (R, p. 68). In the world of trade, as in the world of intimate human relationships, diplomacy seems a necessity; while Travers trades in favours and immunities, the Wajo traders use their diplomacy to secure supplies and markets. In The Rescue there is a clear division between the diplomats and those whose dealings are direct and above board. The term "diplomacy" occurs again during the infuriating initial exchange between Travers and Lingard, when the latter is rebuffed in his efforts to assist the stranded whites on the Hermit. Alluding to Lingard's efforts to communicatc with Travers, one of the gentry, d'Alcacer, asks Edith Travers if she has "ever seen a man dashing himself at a stone wall" (R, p. 129). "No," she replies, "I did not know it was ever done: men burrow under or slip round quietly while they look the other way" (R, p. 130). D'Alcacer observes that Lingard has none of this kind of diplomacy; he is, rather, a direct, honest romantic who, as we eventu ally learn, has a "singleminded brain" and a "guileless breast" (R, p. 282). In contrast, Travers is a politician in the worst sense. He suspects everyone; he projects his own low ambitions and methods on Lingard and accuses him of "hectoring" (R, p. 127), "playing a dangerous game" (R, p. 130), and applying the "ethics of blackmail" (R, p. 273). Travers is low enough to resort to intimidation, threatening to call his personal friend, Sir John. He cannot handle the unexpected straightforwardness of the situation. "I don't know who you are" (R, p. 131), he shouts in desperation; and King Tom, whose name does not appear in the European Who's Who or Social Register, can offer no other credentials than his word and his reputation in the Archi pelago. With typical Conradian irony, we learn that Travers himself is "not responsible. Like many men ambitious of directing the affairs of a nation, Mr. Travers disliked the sense of responsibility. He would not have been above evading it in case of need, but with perverse loftiness he really, in his heart, scorned it" (R, p. 455). There are some distinctions to be made between the kinds of diplomacy at work in The Rescue. Jorgenson, the pale ghost who resembles Lingard and who has seen the open grave yawning behind the affairs of men, understands when the time comes that "his task was not diplomacy" (R, p. 389); he has to act, and act promptly. In the native sphere the faithful Jaffir is set against Tengga's leering "diplomatist" (R, p. 421 ) with the forked tongue, who, when Jorgenson called him a liar, "preserved a scandalized silence, though, of course, he had not expected to be believed for a moment" (R, p. 420). Eventually, even local diplomacy wears thin; it impedes and crushes the efforts of Lingard to help his friends. Hassim's growing impatience with the praying and procrastinating Belarab is treated with superb irony: Belarab's hesitation had proved too much even for Hassim's hereditary patience in such matters. It is but becoming that weighty negotiations should be spread over many days, that the same requests and arguments should be repeated in the same words, at many successive interviews.</page><page sequence="5">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy 111 and receive the same evasive answers. Matters of state demand the dig nity and wisdom of rulers. Such are the proceedings of embassies and the dignified patience of envoys. (R, p. 373) Even Lingard is drawn into the sphere of diplomacy, by virtue of his split loyalties to the whites and to his native friends. Mrs. Travers explains to her husband that his and d'Alcacer's release was the result of Lingard's diplo macy: "Matters of high policy and of local politics. Conflict of personal inter ests, mistrust between the parties, intrigues of individuals—you ought to know how that sort of thing works. His diplomacy made use of all that. The first thing to do was not to liberate you but to get you into his keeping. He is a very great man here and let me tell you that your safety depends on his dexterity in the use of his prestige rather than on his power which he cannot use." (R, p. 273) Lingard's involvement in politics at this mundane level rather than at a more removed or exalted level, as a user of small favours rather than as an organizer of great enterprises, marks the beginning of his demise as supreme commander on the Shore of Refuge. There is a certain degree of irony, of course, in Conrad's use of the word "diplomacy," as there is irony in his use of the word "gentleman" in The Rescue. In the real world of human affairs, as opposed to the romantic world of his dreams, Lingard cannot maintain his integrity and plain-dealing; his behaviour must sooner or later qualify, or shatter, his conception of himself as the restorer of kingdoms, as did Lord Jim's. Even Heyst discovers that, in order to confront the forces of evil that invade his island, he must stoop to trickery, intrigue, and diplomacy. "I am not much of a diplomatist" (V, p. 318), he admits to Lena in Victory, later he confesses to having "dissembled my dismay at the unforeseen result of my idiotic diplomacy" (V, p. 325). "A diplomatic statement," he tells her, "is a statement of which everything is true but the sentiment which seems to prompt it. I have never been diplomatic in my relation with mankind—not from regard for its feelings, but from a certain regard for my own. Diplomacy doesn't go well with consistent contempt. I cared little for life and still less for death" (V, p. 325). Lingard's diplomacy docs not go well with his romantic dreams of friendship and the restitution of thrones; his true metier, like Jorgenson's, is action, not diplomacy and backroom intrigues. To quote an anonymous reviewer writing more than a hundred years ago in Saturday Review (13 September 1862), "The hero must, to give meaning to a meaningless phrase, fight for an idea. ... There is very little room for heroes in wars carried on to settle successions, to rectify frontiers, or to maintain balance of power." Like other heroes from the simpler worlds of the epic and the romance, Lingard cannot survive the secularization or commercialization of his vision; that is why a conflict be tween his sense of honour and his passionate impulses destroys him morally. Conrad goes to considerable length in The Rescue to establish the image of Lingard as a figure from a simpler, more heroic age or, rather, as a hero with values that are nobler than those of the petty, artificial world of the Hermit. That is the reason for his alterations in the original manuscript,</page><page sequence="6">112 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy where Lingard's character had been more complex and his motives some what darker; the simplifications are all in the service of artistic integrity, not signs that Conrad no longer wanted to face the darker side of human nature. We know, for example, of Lingard's humble origins; we know, too, that in the Malay archipelago he is called Rajah Laut, or King Tom. His brig, which is the fastest thing afloat and appears to the Wajo watchmen as a mysterious bird from the sky, is called the Lightning. D'Alcacer describes Lingard in terms which leave the reader in no doubt about Conrad's inten tions: "A knight as I live! A descendant of the immortal hidalgo errant upon the sea" (R, p. 142). Mrs. Travers dreams of Lingard "in chain-mail armour and vaguely recalling a Crusader" (R, p. 458); when he first appears to her at their final meeting on the sandbar, he has in the distance "a human form that isolated and alone appeared to her immense: the shape of a giant outlined amongst the constellations" (R, p. 463). When she hears at first hand the story of his rescue of Hassim and Immada and his commitment to restore them to their kingdom, Edith marvels at the nature of the events; but she is even more impressed with the manner in which they have been ex pressed: "They outlined themselves before her memory with the clear simpli city of some immortal legend. They were mysterious, but she felt certain they were absolutely true. They embodied artless and masterful feelings; such, no doubt, as had swayed mankind in the simplicity of its youth" (R,p. 153). Edith Travers herself is described in The Rescue as the true female counter part to Lingard: She was tall, supple, moving freely. Her complexion was so dazzling in the shade that it seemed to throw out a halo around her head. Upon a smooth and wide brow an abundance of pale fair hair, fine as silk, un dulating like the sea, heavy like a helmet, descended low without a trace of gloss, without a gleam in its coils, as though it had never been touched by a ray of light; and a throat white, smooth, palpitating with life, a round neck modelled with strength and delicacy, supported glori ously that radiant face and that pale mass of hair unkissed by sunshine. (R, p. 139) D'Alcacer observes to himself that "of all the women he knew, she alone seemed to be made for action. ... Her supple figure was not dishonoured by any faltering of outlines under the plain dress of dark blue stuff moulding her form with bold simplicity" (R, p. 139). Mrs. Travers is, like Lingard, of a romantic nature, but she has been disenchanted by the discovery that her ideal of a "great passion" (R, p. 151) cannot be attained in the prudent world of society; in Lingard she sees the possibility of fulfilling that once discarded romantic dream. In Immada she sees, perhaps, a vision of herself as a young woman, before the compromises of civilized life had touched her; and her confrontation with Immada on the deck of the Hermit is one of the key passages in the novel : Mrs. Travers fixed her eyes on Immada. Fair-haired and white she asserted herself before the girl of olive face and raven locks with the maturity of perfection, with the superiority of the flower over the leaf,</page><page sequence="7">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy 113 of the phrase that contains a thought over the cry that can only express emotion. Immense spaces and countless centuries stretched between them: and she looked at her as when one looks into one's own heart with absorbed curiosity, with still wonder, with an immense compassion. (R,p. 140) The battle which she must fight in The Rescue is with the centuries, with time itself; this queen of the "palatial drawing rooms" (R, p. 140) must try to throw off the manacles of sophistication and indifference in order to embrace her naked feelings, her primitive impulses and instincts, at whatever cost. Another way of expressing Edith Travers' dilemma is to say she must discard her education, or feel her way back to life. The narrator informs us that, when Lingard immersed himself in the destinies of Hassim and Immada, the centre of his life "shifted about four hundred miles—from the Straits of Mulacca to the Shore of Refuge—and where he felt himself within the circle of another existence, governed by his impulse, nearer his desire" (R, p. 99, italics mine). So, too, does Edith feel herself drawn away from the artificial world of the grounded yacht Hermit, literally and figuratively, as she im merses herself in Lingard's affairs and emotions. For Lingard himself the problem is to maintain his distance from this 'civilized' world, which he had only glimpsed briefly from the decks of a trawler as a youth. The appearance of the Hermit in the Shallows throws him off balance, acts as a magnet that pulls him away from his impulsive enterprise. Before the arrival of his country men he had drifted into an entirely different world, where his identity, his reputation, and his social status bore no relation to the facts of his previous existence; but this unexpected encounter with shapes from his past throws Lingard out of gear mentally: To the unconscious demand of these people's presence, of their ignor ance, of their faces, of their voices, of their eyes, he had nothing to give but a resentment that had in it a germ of reckless violence. He could tell them nothing because he had not the means. Their coming at this moment, when he had wandered beyond that circle which race, memories, early associations, all the essential conditions of one's origin, trace round every man's life, deprived him in a manner of the power of speech. He was confounded. It was like meeting exacting spectres in a desert. (R, p. 121-122) Faced with Travers' refusal to shake hands, with his growing suspicion and unconcealed disgust, Lingard is, to put the matter in the simplest terms, socially at a loss. Travers demands to be treated as a great man, but he is unprepared to grant the same respect to King Tom; he regards the meeting as an un necessary intrusion on his privacy and spares no effort to insult Lingard. The breakdown or, rather, the failure of communication between the two worlds is most savagely mirrored in the insulting words addressed by the ignorant sailing-master to Lingard's royal friends, Hassim and Immada: " 'Hey! Johnny! Hab got fish? Fish! One peecee fish! Eh? Saveel Fish—" (R, p. 136). Lingard's loss of the faculty of speech at the exact moment of his encounter with the Europeans is extremely important, both as an image of the ultimate conflict between two worlds—that of plain-dealing and straight-talking and</page><page sequence="8">114 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy that of double-dealing and diplomacy—and as a clue to another of Conrad's central concerns in The Rescue. If The Arrow of Gold, with its images of painting, is about various ways of seeing experience, The Rescue is about various ways of hearing or listening; it is a novel wjth vast silences, silences which correspond to the spaces between people. What is important in The Rescue is the way in which a thing sounds', the interpretation of events hangs upon the way a greeting is made. Ears are attuned to catch the slightest hint of friendliness or animosity or sarcasm; significantly, simple, heroic Lingard seldom indulges in irony, though the natives and Europeans frequently do. This is a world that can be lost if, for a moment, a character ceases to listen, especially to the sound of his own inner voice. Lingard's tone of voice, as much as his rugged appearance, puts Travers off; it is not sufficiently deferen tial. And what makes Lingard attractive to d'Alcacer and to Edith Travers is the fact of his earnestness, his complete lack of pretence. In The Rescue Conrad is concerned to explore, as he was somewhat in Victory, the relation between speech and sentiment, between statement and meaning. The problem is summed up in Lena's statement to Heyst—"I hear what you say; but what does it mean" (V, p. 325)—which triggers off his discussion of the meaning of diplomacy. To ascertain what a statement means, a listener must know something about the nature of language and the way in which it is being used, or abused; he must catch the speaker's intonation. The Rescue, more than any other Conrad novel, takes as its operative metaphor speech itself—or, more generally, language; it is replete with allu sions to tone of voice. Daman, we are told, speaks in "an ironic and subdued tone" (R, p. 223). Belarab, the pious statesman, "talked, low-voiced and dignified, with now and then a subtle intonation, a pervasive inflexion or a half-melancholy smile in the course of an argument" (R, p. 435). In contrast, Tengga the bully "discoursed loudly and his words were the words of a doomed man" (R, p. 446). Jorgenson admits to Lingard, "I can speak English, I can speak Dutch, I can speak every lingo of these islands—I remember things that would make your hair stand on end—but I have for gotten the language of my own country" (R, p. 103). Yet Edith Travers says of him: "That man has no tone, and so much depends on that" (R, p. 307). Inevitably, Jorgenson's tonelessness, his voicc from the grave, makes Edith distrust him and not give the crucial ring-message to Lingard. After the ensuing explosion that shatters lives and illusions on the Shore of Refuge, Carter tries to rouse the defeated Lingard by "raising his voice without altering its self-contained tone" (R, p. 424); later, he resorts to his "gentlest tone" (R, p. 427). Finally aroused, Lingard orders Carter "in a stern voice" (R, p. 429) to send for the faithful Wasib, but he addresses the old man "in a low, cautious tone as though he were afraid of the sound of his own voice" (R, p. 448). The list seems endless once one becomes conscious of this particular dimension of the novel. What needs to be recognized is the extent to which this is a novel about voices—some passionate and some dis embodied, some tender and some coldly cruel—about people listening, pondering, meditating, probing the silence that is at the centre of their lives. As Conrad says in Last Essays, concerning his relationship with Stephen Crane: "with us it was the intonation that mattered. The tone of a grunt could convey an infinity of meaning between us" (LE, p. 110).</page><page sequence="9">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy 115 The opening pages of The Rescue set the scene—perhaps one should say, tune the ear—for this drama of voices. The Lightning is becalmed, a silent ship in a silent universe; everything is reflecting and reflective in the mirror of the sea: "To the south and east the double islands watched silently the double ship that seemed fixed amongst them forever, a hopeless captive of the calm, a helpless prisoner of the shallow sea" (R, p. 5). The silence is first broken by the first-mate Shaw, who curses the calm and chatters to a canary somewhere on board. Shaw is a boor; he is gruff, abusive, and insists on asserting himself by giving a senseless order to shift the helm. When Lin gard inquires from below what is happening, Shaw puts on an amiable ex pression and affects a "tone of surprise" ( R, p. 8 ). We are told that Shaw is "abrupt in manner and grumpy in speech" (R, p. 12), that he has a "gos siping tone" (R, p. 20), and that his "discourse" (R, p. 23) consists of bits of faulty history and gossip of which he has no comprehension whatever. His speech is highly mannered, larded with malapropisms and clichés, one of which is, ironically, that when trouble comes he will be found to be ' "all there'" (R, p. 12). An intolerant windbag, Shaw refers to the native or non-white races as "Chinamen" (R, p. 23), "niggers" (R, p. 23), "savages" (R, p. 24), and "flat-nosed chaps" (R, p. 24); his speech is plodding, delib erate, because he is a fool, but also by intention, "accentuating the meaning of his words by the distinctness of his utterance" (R, p. 24). Apart and watchful sit the crew, "dark-faced, soft-eyed silent men" (R, p. 13), who cat with decorum and some reserve. They arc alert, respectful, sensitive enough to the natural phenomena to feel a wind coming while Shaw is still cursing the calm and to spot a boat between the islands after he has seen nothing with the glass. When the helmsman and serang discuss this boat, their exchange is conductcd in "a gentle tone," with a "tender obstinacy" (R, p. 16), and with some irony. Out of the darkness that settles upon the Lightning, eliminating entirely the visible universe, Lingard hears the fatal "English words—deliberate, reaching him one by one; as if each had made its own difficult way through the pro found stillness of the night" (R, p. 28). The voice of Carter registers a "deliberate drawl" and "a tinge of disappointment in its deliberate tone" (R, p. 28). Throughout The Rescue words themselves have a palpable exist ence; they assume forms that can wound or heal, excite or depress, challenge or discourage. After his long conversations with Belarab, we are told that "The faint murmur of the words spoken on that night lingered for a long time in Lingard's cars, more persistent than the memory of an uproar" (R, p. 111). One can almost feel the intense silence that follows the disas trous encounter between Lingard and Travers: Mrs. Travers and d'Alcacer seemed unable to shake off a strong aver sion to talk, and the conversation, like an expiring breeze, kept on dying out repeatedly after each languid gust. The large silence of the horizon, the profound repose of all things visible, enveloping the bodies and penetrating the souls with their quieting influence, stilled thought as well as a voice. For a long time no one spoke. Behind the taciturnity of the masters the servants hovered without noise. (R, pp. 146-147) Travers' dinner-talk contrasts in every way with the restrained talk of the</page><page sequence="10">116 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy insulted natives, Hassim and Immada. D'Alcacer and Edith Travers feel themselves "assailed by official verbiage" (R, p. 147); while Travers rants, his stewards wait, "stoical in the downpour of words like sentries under a shower" (R, p. 148). Shortly after the exasperating dinner, Edith finds herself deep in conversation with Lingard and discovers that the words, the names of native chieftains, "seemed to possess an exceptional energy, a fatal aspect, the savour of madness" (R, p. 163); she perceives that Lingard's confession has "stripped her at once of her position, of her wealth, of her rank, of her past" (R, p. 167). Even Shaw, who has so effectively murdered the language, loses his head and begins to spout about his fears and frustrations to Lingard : "the native grossness of his nature came clattering out like a devil out of a trap. He would blow the gaff, split, give away the whole show, he would back up honest people, kiss the book, say what he thought, let all the world know . .. and when he paused to draw breath, all around him was silent and still. Before the impetus of that respectable passion his words were scattered like chaff driven by a gale and rushed head-long into the night of the Shallows" (R, p. 191). As this Biblical echo suggests, Shaw's pearls turn into swine and are driven into the night, into the sea. In the world of The Rescue speech is the miracle that bridges the separate ness of men, but it is an unstable medium of communication. Shaw speaks of "evil communications corrupting good manners" (R, p. 229), but bad man ners, including speech, can corrupt communications beyond help. In Part VI, Chapter V, d'Alcacer talks frankly and pointedly to Lingard about life and about the fate of men lost in mazes. Lingard does not take offence at, or heed, this barely disguised warning; in fact, he hardly bothers to listen to his companion in captivity. "I can think of nothing," he replies. "I only know that your voice was friendly; and for the rest—" (R, p. 412). Lingard attends not to the meaning of what is said but to the sentiment—that is, to the impulse that drives one man to address another. The norm in human conversation that one finds rendered in The Rescue, as in the plays of Chekhov and Pinter, includes a series of broken monologues, dead-ends, and non-sequitirs that always communicate more or less than the words themselves on a rational level. There are two notable passages in the novel in which Conrad employs what might be called a verbal or conversational realism. The first is a con versation between Shaw and his captain, Lingard, in which neither character communicates with the other but in which a great deal is communicated to the reader. While Lingard reminisces about a French skipper he had chummed with in Ampanam, in a story the significance of which only becomes clear to the reader in retrospect, Shaw tries to interject comments to reinforce his image of himself as a knowledgeable man; one of his comments is a delight fully prosaic modernization of the fall of Troy: "Women are the cause of a lot of trouble," he said, dispassionately. "In the Morayshire, I remember, we had once a passenger—an old gentleman—who was telling us a yarn about them old-time Greeks fighting for ten years about some woman. The Turks kidnapped her or something. Anyway, they fought in Turkey; which I may well believe. Them Greeks and Turks were always fighting. My father was master's mate on board one of the three-deckers at the battle of Navarino—and</page><page sequence="11">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy 117 that was when we went on to help those Greeks. But this affair about a woman was long before that time." (R, p. 22) Shaw's comment, which sounds rather like Huck Finn giving Jim a lesson in history, serves an important function in The Rescue: not only is it an off handed reminder of the relation between Lingard's affairs and those of epic literature, but also it is an historical parallel of kidnapping and bloodshed and diplomacy that throws yet another light on events on the Shore of Refuge, in which there is a woman of considerable beauty and a hero whose fine con science proves to be his Achilles heel. A better example of Conrad's close attention to the psychology of speech and communication in The Rescue may be found in Part V, Chapter III, where Lingard and Edith Travers engage in a conversation which is ostensibly about opera, but which is really about their respective views of reality. Edith says that her departure from Belarab's stockade had seemed like " 'walking upon a splendid stage in a scene from an opera, in a gorgeous show fit to make an audience hold its breath. You can't possibly guess how unreal all this seemed, and how artificial I felt myself. An opera you know .." (R, p. 300). Lingard, to whose simple mind metaphor is an unknown quantity, adds that he and some mates once saw an opera in Melbourne. When Edith questions him concerning his response to this travesty, this "defiance of all truth," Lingard declares that "of the few shows I have seen that one was the most real to me. More real than anything in life" (R, p. 301). While the dialogue here is realistic in terms of its underlying psychology, it clearly functions on a symbolic level; and the opera image connects with the other theatrical images that Edith Travers employs in her efforts to explain her immersion in a strange new experience. When Lingard asks her to bring the Hermit's company on board the Lightning, even if it means playing a part, he tells Edith: "It's no play either" (R, p. 159). For her part, she sees Lingard in terms of a "great actor" moving "on a darkened stage in some simple and tremendous drama," though she knows that "This was no stage play" (R, p. 282). As she goes with Lingard in the hope of gaining the freedom of her husband and d'Alcacer, Edith Travers has the "sensation of acting in a gorgeously got up play on the brilliantly lighted stage of an exotic opera whose accompaniment was not music but the varied strains of the all-pervading silence" (R, p. 295). She tries to explain to Lingard that she has never had his capacity to lose himself in life, to become, as it were, unconscious of the spectacle: "Do you know the greatest difference there is between us? It is this: That I have been living since my childhood in front of a show and that I never have been taken in for a moment by its tinsel and its noise or by anything that went on on the stage" (R, p. 305). Eventually, she loses her sense of apartness, her self-conscious ness and glimpses the reality of what is happening to her: "She saw, she imagined, she even admitted now the reality of those things no longer a mere pageant marshalled for her vision with barbarous splendour and savage emphasis. She questioned it no longer—" (R, p. 367). When she goes to meet Lingard in the stockade, carrying a torch like the Statue of Liberty, she finally abandons herself to her illusion, to the destructive element of her</page><page sequence="12">118 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy passionate involvement. But even then, dressed in native costume and pro tected by the dark, she has only "a moment of self-forgetfulness"; she abandons herself to Lingard's embrace "Not instinctively but with resignation and as it were from a sense of justice" (R, p. 395). What Conrad seems to be working at in The Rescue is a language of notation, in which speech itself is many-faceted and functions at both the real and the symbolic levels; as was evident in many of the conversations between Heyst and Lena in Victory, meaning or sentiment are the sub-text that must be searched for behind the words. Although he does not elaborate on the subjcct, this seems to be what Jocelyn Baines has in mind in his observations on The Rescue: "More, perhaps, than in any of his other novels Conrad relies, at least in two parts, on what is implied rather than what is explicitly stated."" Conrad is clearly more interested in the linguistic and psychological possibilities of his material than he is in plot. Readers who find The Rescue static might consider Stanislavsky's famous justification of the plays of Chek hov, whose work has also been described as static: "His plays are full of action, not in their external but in their inner development. In the very in activity of his characters a complex inner activity is concealed."4 There is in The Rescue, as in most of the later novels, a good deal of inner activity. Gesture, understatement, irony, circumlocution, non-sequitirs—these are the tips of the iceberg; they are the notations by which we perceive the complex inner space that has always been Conrad's primary concern. As he reminds us in the Author's Note to Within the Tides: To render a crucial point of feeling in terms of human speech is really an impossible task. Written words can only form a sort of translation. And if that translation happens, from want of skill or from over-anxiety, to be too literal, the people caught in the toils of passion, instead of disclosing themselves, which would be art, are made to give themselves away, which is neither art nor life. Nor yet truth! At any rate, not the whole truth; for it is truth robbed of all its necessary and sympathetic reservations and qualifications which give it its fair form, its just pro portions, its semblance of human fellowship. (WT, viii-ix) The very difficulty of the translation seems to have inspired Conrad to finish this troublesome novel and to incorporate into its structure, its form, the actual matter of style that had so long delayed its appearance in print. Throughout The Rescue he is concerned not only with specch and its limita tions, but also with other related aspects of human behaviour, which I described initially as manners. Closely related to the matter of diplomacy in The Rescue is a considerable emphasis on etiquette or decorum. Each charac ter has a clear, though possibly absurd, sense of what is required of him, or her, in a given situation. Lingard believes, quite rightly, that his failure to comc to any understanding with Travers stems from the fact that, as he says to Edith Travers, "No! I suppose I didn't look enough like a gentleman" (R, p. 164). His forthright manner and rugged appearance offend the di :iJoceIyn Baines, Joseph Conrad: A Critical Biography (London, 1960), p. 417. ^Stanislavsky, My Life and Art.

Travers' indignation, like his Kurtzian hatred of "inferior" (R, p. 148) races, has nothing whatever to do with morality. "I own with regret I did in a measure lose my temper," he confesses; "but then you will admit that the existence of such a man is a disgrace to civilization" (R, p. 147). Travers rejects the possibility that Lingard is right about the danger of the situation and declares, pompously: "It is the social aspect of such an incident I am desirous of criticizing" (R, p. 147). All of his social pretentions, including monocle, silver tea-service, and brass-buttoned stewards, stand juxtaposed with his insensitivity and indirection; in fact, the contradiction which he represents is perfectly embodied in the position of his yacht Hermit, grounded on the Shallows. Lingard has a very different notion of what constitutes a gentleman. He redefines the word in terms of morals rather than manners, attitudes and actions rather than appearances. "And 1 would know what a gentleman would do," he says to Edith Travers. "Come! Wouldn't he treat a stranger fairly? Wouldn't he remember that no man is a liar until you prove him so? Wouldn't he keep his word wherever given?" (R, p. 164). Though Travers fails the test, Lingard does find a gentleman in the Travers' guest and travelling-companion, d'Alcacer. As he observes to Edith: "He was trying to make it up between me and your husband, wasn't he? I was too angry to pay much attention, but I like him well enough. What pleased me most was the way in which he gave it up. That was done like a gentleman. Do you understand what I mean, Mrs. Travers?" (R, pp. 258-259). What he means is that d'Alcacer has a sense of style, a sensitivity to occasion, which Lingard himself understands and appreciates. We know, for example, that Lingard's burial proceedings for the Lascar, slain at the time of his first meeting with Hassim, impress both his own crew and his guests from Hassim's prau: "In such acts performed simply, from conviction, what may be called the romantic side of his nature came out; that responsive sensitiveness to the shadowy appeals made by life and death, which is the groundwork of a chivalrous character" (R, p. 74). Like Lingard, d'Alcacer has a "chivalrous respect" (R, p. 124) for the feelings and privacy of others. Travers, on the other hand, has not a generous or chivalrous bone in his body; he is described as a man "whose life and thought, ignorant of human passion, were devoted to ex tracting the greatest possible amount of personal advantage out of human in stitutions" (R, p. 123). Decorum and style are not inappropriate terms to bring to a discussion of The Rescue; indeed, the matter of decorum, or style, is seldom absent from the description of Lingard's chivalric proceedings. When Hassim has been insulted by Travers' sailing-master, Lingard explains to his friend that "They take a rajah for a fisherman"; Hassim's cool, ironic reply—"A great mistake, for, truly, the chief of ten fugitives without a country is much less than the headman of a fishing village" (R, p. 136)—serves to heighten the contrast between the tasteless, crude world of Travers and the dignity and restraint of Lingard and his friends. Conrad would have felt quite at home, I suspect, with the simple ideas, such as courage, fidelity, and etiquette, that are central to heroic and romance literatures; and, considering the epic scope of The Rescue, the heroic mould in which Lingard and Edith Travers are cast, and the</page><page sequence="14">120 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy frequent allusions to the world of chivalry, it seems natural to consider the elements that his novel has in common with these literatures. One thinks immediately of the formal speeches that occur when Beowulf meets one by one the coast-warden, Wulfgar, Hrothgar, and Unferth. These speeches are in the heroic style and contain considerable formulaic material. Beowulf addresses the coast-warden with a formal account of his own genealogy, the manner of his father's life and death, the purpose of his mission, and not without a few mild boasts. His tact, however, is always beyond question : "We are people of the Geatish nation and heart-companions of Hygelac. My father was renowned among peoples, a noble leader in battle named Ecgtheow. He tarried many winters before he, an old man, passed away from the dwellings of men; each of the wise men far and wide through out the earth recalls him readily. We have come to seek thy lord, the son of Healfdene, the protector of the people, with honourable intent; give us good counsel! We have a great errand to the famous ruler of the Danes, nor shall ought of it be kept secret, as I think." This quotation has all the ingredients, the inflated rhetoric, the concern for propriety, and so on, that are found in the formal greetings between Lingard and the native chieftains. The meet ing with Daman, for example, is described largely in terms of Daman's regal bearing and appearance; and Lingard, having already required his compan ion, Edith Travers, to dress appropriately for the occasion, hastens to remind her of the proper gesture to make to an Arab chieftain. "Great is your power," Daman begins, typically; then he proceeds to define precisely the nature of his political alliance with Lingard: "But you and I are men that have real power. Yet there is a truth that you and I can confess to each other. Men's hearts grow quickly discontented. Listen. The leaders of men are carried forward in the hands of their followers: and common men's minds are unsteady, their desires changeable, and their thoughts not to be trusted. You are a great chief they say. Do not forget that I am a chief, too, and a leader of armed men." (R, p. 294) There is at work on the Shore of Refuge in The Rescue, as in Beowulf, something akin to classical restraint, a self-imposed control which is in itself one small stay against the anarchy, self-interest, and cruelty of the historical process. Lingard's heroic cast, like Beowulf's, is matched by numerous graccs, including a sensitivity to decorum and ritual as well as an emotional and verbal control remarkable in a white man. What C. S. Lewis has said of ritual applies equally well to the idea of style in The Rescue: "It is a pattern imposed on the mere flux of our feelings by reason and will, which renders pleasures less fugitive and griefs more endurable, which hands over to the power of wise custom the task (to which the individual and his moods are so inade quate) of being festive or sober, gay or reverent, when we choose to be, and not at the bidding of chance."5 When Lingard is jolted out of his familiar context and its rituals, he loses his sense of his own identity, his style, so that he no longer knows how to react, how to deal with the issues that confront him; as long as he deals with concrete problems he can function, but the unknown, the unexpected, troubles him beyond his capacities. r&gt;C. S. Lewis, A Preface lo Paradise Lost (London, 1960), p. 22.</page><page sequence="15">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy 121 Conrad had no doubt about the importance of style in men's lives. He was himself a great stickler for decorum, known to be fastidious about dress and unusually polite in his dealings, even with fools. The details of his life were as important to him as the details of his art; in the Author's Note to The Shadow-Line, he speaks of "the shame, and almost the anguish with which one remembers some unfortunate occurrence, down to mere mistakes in speech, that have been perpetrated by one in the past" (TSL, vii). In fact, this great stylist in prose and seamanship stated the matter quite clearly in A Familiar Preface to A Personal Record: "And in this matter of life and art it is not the Why that matters so much to our happiness as the How. As the Frenchman said, 'Il y a toujours la manière' " (APR, xix). In The Rescue it is a Spaniard, not a Frenchman, who best embodies this principle of style. When Lingard is rendered impotent by his susceptibility to pressures of conscience (in the form of conflicting loyalties) and to his pas sions (in the delightful form of Edith Travers), d'Alcacer emerges as another possibility, indeed the only one, open to us in a world that is sadly out of joint. Conrad seems to be saying, as I suggested earlier, that the world is too complex to support such active manifestations of the heroic. Conrad has great sympathy for the ideal of fidelity to which Lingard has pledged himself, but it is with d'Alcacer that he feels most at home in The Rescue. This civilized Spaniard is the consciousness through which his most important observations are made in the novel. D'Alcacer represents a centre of calm (not indifference) between the passive, sterile society of the Hermit and the tragically active and doomed world of the Lightning. He must not be seen as a carbon copy of Decoud in Nostromo, whose scepticism ends in suicide; nor is he a Hamlet or a Prüf rock, detached and disenchanted like Heyst in Victory. That role belongs more to Edith Travers than to d'Alcacer. If he is a sceptic, he is one who has come through the Centre of Indifference, not with the affirmation and gusto of Carlyle but at least with sufficient irony and perspective to be somewhat amused and indulgent with life. I make this point because of its significance to The Rescue and to a reading of the later fiction generally. Many critics complain about Conrad's so-called later affirmations. I would be disposed to reject any critical preoccupation with, or demand for, either angst or affirmation in art; we ought to take whatever content we find and be done with it, since what matters is what an author does with his chosen materials. At the same time, I believe that Conrad's later fiction is far less affirmative, in the superficial sense in which Hewitt and Moser and Guerard employ the term, than is generally admitted. There are affirmations in Victory and Chance, to be sure, but they are only limited affirmations (all illusions, Conrad can be heard whispering), such as fidelity, courage, and sympathy, with which men cling to one another and to this earth. One reason for the failure to understand the later novels is the tendency to read a novel solely in terms of action, or plot, to the exclusion of other possibilities of meaning. The whole world of a novel, not just a single character or chain of events, is a metaphor for the author's vision and must be seen in its entirety before anything significant can be said about affirmation or angst or apathy. The road to salvation that may be glimpsed dimly through the fabric of a work of art must be tested in relation to each of the characters that struggle to</page><page sequence="16">122 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy find it—whether a Heyst or a Marlow or a Lord Jim. The Rescue is not a happy, or even superficially affirmative, novel. As Jocelyn Baines has ob served: "It is a melancholy but moving book. Its mood of defeatism and world-weariness is even more pronounced than that of Victory, which does at least contain a positive admonition."6 Read solely in terms of Lingard, the novel ends in despair and in moral death; and in terms of Edith Travers, in romantic disillusionment. D'Alcacer, however, is the one character who, although virtually a pawn in the game of life and death that is played on the Shore of Refuge, nevertheless remains somewhat removed and aloof from it. And it is precisely his position between the Scylla of passion and the Charyb dis of paralysis that makes him an important centre of interest in the novel. Our first glimpse of d'Alcacer is as a tall white-clad figure, in attendance upon Edith Travers, standing with his arm entwined around an awning stanchion on the deck of the Hermit. He seems to have stepped off the set of a Wilde play, insisting that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it with style. Everything about the man gives the impression of good taste— not artificial like that of Blunt and his mother in The Arrow of Gold, but perfectly natural. When he and Travers arc released from their imprisonment by Daman's henchmen, we are told that d'Alcacer "advanced smiling, as if the beach were a drawing-room" (R, p. 298). In terms of manners and dress, d'Alcacer is not showy or affected; he is a master of understatement. He asks Edith Travers to warn him of any bad turn of events by simply raising her left hand to her forehead, a gesture as subdued as the stylized manifestation of grief in a Japanese Noh play. His dignity (and here Conrad is smiling but not laughing) is such that he even tips his hat to Edith as he goes over the side of the Emma to a probable death. And yet d'Alcacer is not a chivalrous fop with an impeccable set of manners; he has a sense of his own presence that supports him in the most trying circumstances. While Lingard slumps helplessly and mournfully beside him during their internment in Belarab's stockade, d'Alcacer exhibits a studied calm; he restrains his im pulses and emotions and decides, after some deliberation, to smoke one of his three remaining cigarettes, leaving the other two for his departure the following day through the gates of the stockade to his death. And this for the reason that "A cigarette soothed, it gave an attitude" (R, p. 411). His style, including this little ritual, supports him in the face of an irrational universe; the poetry in his nature, to use Frost's words, provides "a momen tary stay against confusion." Although Travers considers d'Alcaccr unprincipled, Lingard sees him as a man of honour, a gentleman. D'Alcacer responds with great sympathy and tact to the simple idealism of Lingard and to Edith's fatal attraction to it. "Not everyone deserves to be touched by fire from heaven" (R, p. 130), he tells her. On at least two occasions he refrains from questioning décisions that he believes were made on the basis of Lingard's sense of honour, even though these decisions affect his life immensely. "A point of honour is not to be discussed" (R, p. 349), he confides, unless it is at the expense of ordinary humanity. Wc are informed that d'Alcacer "had that truly aristo cratic nature which is inclined to credit every honest man with something of "Baines, op. cit., p. 417.</page><page sequence="17">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy 123 its own nobility and in its judgment is altogether independent of class feeling" (R, p. 309). The narrator's insistence on d'Alcacer's nobility is without irony in The Rescue, perhaps because there are sufficient alternatives or polarities in the other characters to provide a spectrum of views on the subject. In Victory both Hcyst and his infernal counterpart, plain Mr. Jones, are described as gentlemen, Heyst sympathetic and fastidious to a sin and Jones unbearably aloof and affected. Conrad places most of the remarks about the qualities of a gentleman, ironically, on the cunning and bewhiskered lips of Mr. Jones' henchman, Martin Ricardo, which serves as an effective undercutting. In The Arrow of Gold the upper classes fare rather badly, too, although some distinction is made between the natural sympathies of M. George and Mills and the vulgar sentiments and values of Don Juan Blunt and his mother. Mrs. Blunt is described in terms that are the exact opposite of those applied to d'Alcacer: "The implication of scorn in her tranquil manner was immense. It seemed to condemn all those that were not born in the Blunt connection. It was the perfect pride of Republican aristocracy, which has no gradations and knows no limit, and, as if created by the grace of God, thinks it ennobles everything it touches: people, ideas, even passing tastes!" (AG, p. 185). There is nothing blunt about d'Alcacer. His motto would be that which Conrad quotes so frequently in his work: tout comprendre est tout pardoner. His immense sympathies are a product, the narrator informs us, of his "natural gift of insight" (R, pp. 309-310) into situations and people around him. He is "acutely observant and alert to the slightest hint" (R, p. 346); he looks with "profound attention" (R, p. 412) at every aspect of his immediate world. From his discriminating consciousness come the most in teresting observations about events in The Rescue. He coins the phrase "Man of Fate" (R, p. 312) for Lingard and describes him as "a rough man naively engaged in a contest with heaven's injustice (R, p. 346); he per ceives that Lingard is "lost in a maze" (R, p. 412) and will eventually die of a broken heart or be killed morally. About women in general and Edith Travers in particular, he is insatiably curious; of those women who are truly great, like Edith and her counterpart Rita de Lastaola in The Arrow of Gold, d'Alcacer makes a comment to Lingard that brings together both the heroic and the theatrical allusions which we have discussed: "No, there are not many of them. And yet they are all. They decorate our lives for us. They are the gracious figures on the drab wall which lies on this side of our common grave. They lead a sort of ritual dance, that most of us have agreed to take seriously. It is a very binding agree ment, with which sincerity and good faith and honor have nothing to do. Very binding. Woe to him or to her who breaks it. Directly they leave the pageant they are lost." (R, p. 412) Disgusted at the thought of not being able to face his death at the hands of thugs with "calm dignity" (R, p. 408), d'Alcacer comes to the ironic con clusion that civilization has at least one advantage: it does not allow one to be crudely speared in the back: "It was a shudder of disgust because Mr. d'Alcacer was a civilized man and though he had no illusions about civilization he could not but admit the superiority of its methods. It offered one a certain</page><page sequence="18">124 The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy refinement of form, a comeliness of proceedings and definite safeguards against deadly surprises" (R, p. 408). D'Alcacer is more interesting because more highly characterized than his close relative Marlow in Chance, but he shares with Marlow an unusual degree of sensitivity to natural and moral phenomena. He is struck with awe and wonder not only by the immensity of the passions of Edith and Lingard, but also by the responses of the diminutive, cringing Travers: "All this was not very impressive. There was something pitiful in it: whisper, grip, shudder, as of a child frightened in the dark. But that emotion was deep. Once more that evening, but this time aroused by the husband's distress, d'Alcacer's wonder approached the borders of awe" (R, p. 357). D'Alcacer is, in short, one of Conrad's fine consciences. And he shares with his creator an alertness to the spectacle of the universe, a curiosity about its things, events, and people. Like Conrad, d'Alcacer would subscribe to those sentiments expressed in A Personal Record about the universe being not ethical in its purpose, but rather "purely spectacular: a spectacle for awe, love, adoration, or hate, if you like, but in this view—and in this view alone— never for despair" (APR, p. 92); he, too, possesses "the high tranquility of a steeled heart" and "the detached curiosity of a subtle mind" (APR, p. 92). D'Alcacer's function in The Rescue is to provide a counterbalance to the beautifully impossible romanticism of Lingard and Edith Travers; without him the novel would be incomplete. As Conrad says in his essay on Henry James in Notes on Life and Letters: "The range of a fine conscience covers more good and evil than the range of a conscience which may be called, roughly, not fine; a conscience, less troubled by the nice discrimination of shades of conduct. A fine conscience is more concerned with essentials; its triumphs are more perfect, if less profitable, in a worldly sense" (p. 17). D'Alcacer's irony and worldly wisdom, as does the narrative irony in Victory and The Shadow-Line, renders acceptable to the modern temper, which is sceptical of romance and of all manifestations of the marvelous, Conrad's "Romance of the Shallows," as The Rescue is subtitled; and it justifies and explains, also, that exclamation from Chaucer's "The Frankeleyn's Tale" which serves as the novel's epigraph: "'Alias!' quod she, 'that ever this sholde happe! For wende I never, by possibilitee, that swich a monstre or merveille might be!' " Considering Conrad's concern for style, or expression, in The Rescue, and his efforts to render credible his ironic romance, this novel has fared rather badly at the hands of his critics. Frederick Karl, for example, criticizes The Rescue for "overblown phrases," "overwriting," and for "the pretentious solemnity" of the chapter headings; the novel, he says, is a "hodge-podge of Conrad's major techniques and themes" which loses its claim to the reader's attention by "purple passages that denigrate the quality of the novel. That Conrad allowed these passages to stand after the numerous revisions the book underwent, is testimony to his loss of critical power." Karl quotes five passages which, though "not the worst of Conrad's writing," are nevertheless unim pressive and "establish a cheap style for The Rescue"; he even dismisses Lingard for not being a Faust or, at least, a Lord Jim. Nowhere does Karl explain precisely what it is about these passages that makes them cheap and unsatisfactory; he merely assumes that readers will understand what he</page><page sequence="19">The Rescue: Conrad and the Rhetoric of Diplomacy 125 means by "effective language" and "an effective chief character." That there are elements well worth a reader's attention in The Rescue seems unques tionable. Even Karl admits at the outset of his discussion that the book "contains everything good" in Conrad, though he does not say what these good things are; and he observes, with no sense of contradiction or paradox in his argument, that "the language, the setting, the pace of the novel" all have much in common with Conrad's most ambitious work, Nostromo? I mention Karl's remarks, not because his analysis of The Rescue is without merit, but because they are typical of the kind of two-handed Johnsonian criticism that has plagued Conrad since his earliest days as a novelist by critics who arc more sensitive to the larger components of fiction, such as character and action, than they are to specifically linguistic matters. In 1896 H. G. Wells made a similar kind of criticism in his review of An Outcast of the Islands for Saturday Review. He described the novel as "per haps the finest piece of fiction that has been published this year," but went on to qualify his praise in a most absurd fashion: "One fault it has, and a glaring fault... Mr. Conrad is wordy; his story is not so much told as seen intermittently through a haze of sentences. He has still to learn the great half of his art, the art of leaving things unwritten. ... he writes despicably. He writes so as to mask the greatness that is in him."* Wells' distaste for impressionistic prose is understandable, and it anticipates the reaction to metaphor and anthropomorphic analogy that characterizes much of the fiction and criticism of fiction of this century, especially in Europe; but his habit of praising with faint damns is quite unacceptable in terms of its ignoring of one of the major technical preoccupations of Conrad, the interrelation or blending of form and content. For Conrad, as for modern critics like Wayne Booth and David Lodge, there is no sense in saying that a book is both fine and despicably written. Conrad's own reply to Wells' criticism makes this point dearly: "Something brings the impression off—makes its effect. What? It can be nothing but the expression—the arrangement of words, the style—Ergo: the style is not dishonourable."" Conrad was more faithful than Lingard to his rescue work, "this snatching of vanished phases of turbulence, disguised in fair words, out of the native obscurity into a light where the struggling forms may be seen, seized upon, endowed with the only possible form of permanence in this world of relative values—the permanence of memory" (Notes on Life and Letters, p. 13). Although it took him twenty-two years to bring this rescued fragment to light, when he did finish The Rescue he had found a style; he had found, as he confesses in the Author's Note to the novel, "the proper formula of expression, the only formula that would suit" (NN, viii). With proper Conradian irony, it seems to have taken critics more than twice as long to take Conrad at his word and to gain some inkling of the message he struggled to deliver in The Rescue by examining closely the medium of language.
