They certainly did not notice the holes that could be picked in that fine speech. ?Kafka, The Stoker For what is a book in itself? A book is a physical object in a world of physical objects. It is a set of dead symbols. And then the reader comes along, and the words?or rather the poetry behind the words, for the words themselves are mere symbols?spring to life, and we have the resurrection of the word. ?Jorge Luis Borges, This Craft of Verse These words of Jorge Luis Borges betray a true poet's longing in modern times. It is for neither children nor books?but for readers. Himself a poet, Friedrich Nietzsche was in search of true readers all his life. And he seems to have found them everywhere except in his own country. "Everywhere else I have readers," he complains about his compatriots in Ecce Homo?"in Vienna, in St. Peters burg, in Stockholm, in Copenhagen, in Paris, in New York?everywhere I have been discovered; but not in the shallows of Europe, Germany."1 At that time, in 1889, he could not possibly have known that his enumeration of "great cities" 1.

It was in Prague, in the same spring of 1883 when Nietzsche gave birth to his favorite son and double, Zarathustra, that his first true reader (in time and rank) was born: Franz Kafka, eldest child of Julie and Hermann Kafka, the latter the head of a typical Jewish middle-class German-speaking family. Reading Kafka as Nietzsche's first true reader?in what way does this proj ect transcend the established discussion of the relationship between the poet philosopher and the philosopher poet? The resonance between their works had been clearly audible from the beginning. This led Max Brod, first editor of Kafka's posthumous writings and would-be gatekeeper of Kafka interpre tation, to try to disconnect Kafka, "the rejuvenator of old Jewish religiosity," from Nietzsche, the prophet of the death of God. "In the history of the last century," Brod wrote in 1963, "Nietzsche is Kafka's antipode with almost mathematical exactitude. Some Kafka interpreters only demonstrate their lack of instinct when trying to bring together Kafka and Nietzsche on one level of analysis?as if there existed even the vaguest ties or comparisons and not just pure opposition."2 This, of course, is a statement "diesseits von Gut und B?se" {on this side of good and evil). Any alert Nietzschean would immediately object that "this way of judging constitutes the typical prejudg ment and prejudice which give away the metaphysicians of all ages," that "the fundamental faith of the metaphysicians is the faith in opposite values," and that "it might even be possible that what constitutes the value of these good and revered things is precisely that they are insidiously related, tied to, and involved with these wicked, seemingly opposite things?maybe even one with them in essence."3 Kafka scholars, of course, did not get beyond Brod and "good and evil" that easily. At any rate, they proved with some diligence that Kafka had started reading Nietzsche in the summer of 1900; that he even possessed some books by Nietzsche; that he, if not in turn pos sessed by him, could at least have been classified a Nietzschean for a while; that he must have reread Nietzsche later in his life; and that, thanks to his "phenomenal memory" and "first class mind," he was able to use Nietzsche as a "source-book" for literary images as well as a medium to reflect his philo sophical ideas.4 2.

I would like to suggest that Kafka did not simply read Nietzsche either "as a philosopher" or "as a poet." Shift ing focus from language and thought to discourse, I shall argue not only that Nietzsche outlined a set of critical issues relevant for the Kafka generation of intellectuals but that for Kafka, Nietzsche himself constituted a crucial prob lem. It is here that the common essence of the antipodes can be found. A first impression of the problematic relation between Kafka and Nietzsche may be gained by juxtaposing two quotes on the issue of professional risk. First Nietzsche: Great men, like great ages, are explosives storing up immense energy.5 I know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous?a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite. (EH, 782) Then Kafka: The blasting operations require workers who are acquainted with all con nected dangers and who have been repeatedly and soundly instructed. The lack of such workers results from the fact that currently no preliminary knowledge is required for these operations. . . . Blastings may be carried out only by skilled workers, and according to the safety regulations. It is prohibited to use loose explosives. All explo sives must be stored safely.6 These statements mark the point of origin and the point of view for Kafka's reading of Nietzsche. In fact, they include a first hint at the real aim of Nietz sche's cultural struggle against "Christian morality': the emergence of bio power and its strategies of appropriating and channeling human energy or, to use a historiographical abbreviation, the Bismarckian welfare state. The lives of Nietzsche's "great men" are immune to these measures of regulation and normalization; they are uninsurable risks by the standards of the welfare state. 5.

The decisive difference between them stems from the very nature of their occupa tions. Unlike Nietzsche, Kafka literally knows what he is talking about when he writes about explosives. As an employee of the Workers' Accident Insur ance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia from 1908 to 1922, Kafka acquired professional expertise in three areas?accident prevention, accident statistics, and insurance propaganda. Though this last element was never mentioned in his logbook, Kafka received from the very beginning of his career such ticklish assignments as explaining the more complex operations of Bohemian accident insurance to government authorities, industrial lobbies, unions, and the wider public. This remarkable fact points to another dimension of Kafka's expertise: his knowledge as a writer, a nonprofessional expert in language. It is this rare combination of skills that predestined Kafka to be Nietzsche's first true reader and, consequently, the author of a unique set of safety regulations. The insurance of explosives, then, is not merely a metaphorical link between Nietzsche and Kafka. It is not simply the metaphor of insurance that leads back from Kafka to Nietzsche, but rather a specific professional exper tise. Hence I shall retrace Kafka's reading of Nietzsche on the level not of signs but of discourse. It is here that Kafka's mode of writing, his peculiar use of language, can be made visible as a "professional" answer to Nietzsche's blast ing operations. After looking at the concepts of risk and danger in Nietzsche's diagnosis of occidental culture, I shall expose four crucial techniques that Kafka combines in his peculiar discourse of "culture insurance": parody, decon struction, reflection, and association. According to Niklas Luhmann, "Classical traditions . . . provide few open ings for topics such as ecology, technology, and risk."7 Luhmann's statement is immediately confirmed when we consult a key source of intelligence on the "dangerous thinker"?Henning Ottmann's otherwise definitely useful Nietzsche-Handbuch. Among the 116 entries in the section on "concepts, the ories, metaphors," there is not a single one on Gefahr (danger) or Risiko (risk) or Sicherheit (safety, security, or certainty).8 There is, however, no way to read Nietzsche without noticing his preoccupation with Gefahren and Sicher heiten, and there is no way to understand him without realizing the focal point 7.

Hennig Ottmann, ed., Nietzsche-Handbuch (Stuttgart: Metzler, 2000), 183-363.</page><page sequence="5">Benno Wagner 87 of his cultural criticism, namely, the emerging welfare state and "insurance society."9 For a provisional sketch of this unmapped part of Nietzsche country, I use Luhmann's distinction between "risk" and "danger" as a starting point? "risk" meaning the possibility of damage resulting from an act of decision or choice, "danger" meaning the possibility of damage as an externally given fact or circumstance.10 The first finding, then, is that Nietzsche does not seem to be a good Luhmannian. Not only is he guilty of the widespread carelessness in terminological issues bemoaned by Luhmann,11 but he also blurs Luhmann's vital distinction between system and environment, or decisions and givens. As the use of the word Risiko is still restricted mainly to specialized discourse (e.g., the discourse of insurance) in late-nineteenth-century German, Nietzsche uses Gefahr for both sides of Luhmann's distinction. For example, in the "attempt at self-criticism" that Nietzsche added to The Birth of Tragedy in 1886, he clas sifies Christian morality as "the danger of dangers." He defends his artistic metaphysic against any reproach of arbitrariness by stressing its essential point, namely, "that it betrays a spirit who will one day fight at any risk whatever [auf jede Gefahr hin] the moral interpretation and significance of existence."12 These two remarks contain the nucleus of Nietzsche's policy of risk and dan ger. In practice, Luhmann reminds us, any calculus of risk is acceptable only as long as it operates below the threshold of catastrophe. Nietzsche's "danger of dangers," however, Christian morality and ensuing nihilism, is nothing less than a cultural disaster. Nevertheless, the ultimate aim of his writing is to trans form this fatal danger into risk?that is, into a set of dangers resulting from decision and choice. But because of its fatal origin (from the "danger of dan gers"), this kind of risk paradoxically operates beyond selection and calculation itself. Nietzsche's struggle against the "moral interpretation and significance of existence" is a struggle "at any risk whatever," and his artistic metaphysic is a device to overcome the principium individuationis, which is the very basis of any selection, decision, or calculation. For the purposes of this article, I would like to distinguish three sepa rate sets or series of dangers in Nietzsche. First, there is the series of danger ous dangers, inherent in the entropie process of contemporary Western cul ture. Here, two entries of immediate significance for Kafka play a prominent 9.

The first, a tendency toward social security and welfare, a eudaemonistic worldview connecting modern culture with its Alexandrian prototype, con cerns Kafka's professional field, social insurance. "Let us mark this well," Nietzsche warns in The Birth of Tragedy. "The Alexandrian culture, to be able to exist permanently, requires a slave class, but with its optimistic view of life it denies the necessity of such a class, and consequently, when its beau tifully seductive and tranquilizing utterances about the 'dignity of man' and the 'dignity of labor' are no longer effective, it gradually drifts toward a dreadful destruction" (111). In On the Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche is even more explicit. The genealogy of Christian morality, the danger of dan gers, shares its origin with the genealogy of social insurance: "When one looks for the beginnings of Christianity in the Roman world, one finds asso ciations for mutual aid, associations for the poor, for the sick, for burial, evolved among the lowest strata of society, in which this major remedy for depression, petty pleasure produced by mutual helpfulness, was consciously employed: perhaps this was something new in those days, a real discovery?"13 And in the second piece of his Unfashionable Observations we are at least led to conclude that social insurance not only is the fatal problem of contem porary occidental culture but also offers the narcotic that prevents us from facing the problem: "It is certainly the hour of a great danger: human beings seem to be close to discovering that the egoism of the individuals, of groups, or of the masses was in all ages the lever behind historical movements, but at the same time they are by no means troubled by this discovery."14 Another recurrent entry in Nietzsche's cultural safety checklist is the danger of "anti quarian" history: "This always brings with it one immediate danger: ulti mately, anything ancient and past that enters into this field of visions is simply regarded as venerable, and everything that fails to welcome the ancient with reverence?in other words, whatever is new and in the process of becoming is met with hostility and rejected. . . . Antiquarian history degenerates from the moment when the fresh life of the present no longer animates and inspires it" (UO, 105). In the famous words of Zarathustra: "It is dangerous to be an heir."15 Finally, it should be remembered that Nietzsche, in his search for means of disaster prevention, considers the emerging welfare state? 13.

It is the false feeling of security that leads Nietzsche to explore a second set of dangers. Though this is another Gefahr in Luhmann's sense?a matter not of decision but of fate?it is already the kind of danger that is part of the solution rather than part of the problem. I am referring to "the most general danger faced by unusual human beings who live in a society bound to the usual" (UO, 185). Nietzsche's foremost example is, of course, Arthur Schopen hauer, and the checklist of dangers is impressive here, comprehending the dan gers of constitution?for instance, the danger of the solitaries who, from time to time, "emerge from their cave with horrible expressions on their faces; at such times their words and deeds are explosions, and it is possible for them to destroy themselves" (UO, 187)?as well as the dangers of the time, such as those solitaries' dangerous longing "for release from their own, exhausted age, but for a culture, a transfigured physis" (UO, 194). As opposed to ordinary men, extraordinary men are endangered and dangerous at the same time. Nietzsche's third set of dangers can be understood only on the basis of the previous ones, and in connection to the name of Zarathustra. What Zara thustra has to offer is an Ausweg, a way out of the danger of dangers and all the particular dangers it implies. What makes this way out appear so "terrible" for Nietzsche's life-insured contemporaries16 is probably not so much the will to power that it is based on as the will to danger immediately connected with the former. Already in his second Unfashionable Observation Nietzsche leaves no doubt that the act of overcoming a decaying cultural inheritance implies an uninsurable risk both for the agents of such a venture and for their contempo raries: "And human beings or ages that serve life by passing judgment on and destroying a past are always dangerous and endangered human beings and ages. For since we are, after all, the products of earlier generations, we are also the products of their aberrations, passions, and errors?indeed, of their crimes" (UO, 107). In the sermon on self-overcoming Zarathustra teaches the wisest ones: "And as the smaller yields to the greater that it may have pleasure and 16.

Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari [Berlin: dtv, 1988], 160).</page><page sequence="8">90 Kafka's Files power over the smallest, thus even the greatest still yields, and for the sake of power risks life. That is the yielding of the greatest: it is hazard and danger and casting dice for death" (TSZ, 115). In German: "Das ist die Hingebung des Gr?ssten, dass es Wagniss ist und Gefahr und um den Tod ein W?rfelspielen." Though the English translation has "hazard" for Wagniss (and not, for exam ple, "venture"), it seems obvious that the prophet of the "overman" is living beyond risk and danger. His decision to face danger, to run a risk, is not an act of rational calculation but a yielding, a surrender. Does this mean, then, that Nietzsche's project is simple adventurism, a romantic affirmation of danger? Certainly not. There is a passage in his post humous writings where Nietzsche proves that he is not such a bad Luhman nian after all: where he uses the word Risiko, and uses it properly: The question posed by nihilism "what for?" stems from the hitherto exist ing habit of receiving this goal as an external claim?by some superhuman authority. Having unlearned to believe in such an authority, one still clings to the old habit and looks for another authority that is able to speak uncon ditionally, to command our goals and tasks [such as conscience, reason, or social instinct]. . . . One tries to elude the will to a goal, the risk to give a goal to oneself; one wants to throw off responsibility.17 Zarathustra's bold claim, "The time has come for man to set himself a goal. The time has come for man to plant the seed of his highest hope" (TSZ, 17), appears in a different light here. The parole is not adventurism but respon sibility. This is a paradoxical kind of responsibility, though: a responsibility based on an act of social dissociation, inevitably leading to a paradoxical risk, a risk about the very basis of any risk calculation, the existence of a goal or a purpose. So much for Nietzsche on disaster, danger, risk, and security. The main purpose of this outline has been to highlight the discourse, or rather, the "prob lematic"18 that motivates Kafka's interest in Nietzsche and that determines the way Kafka "processes" him in his writings. I shall now turn to my reconstruc tion of the four discursive modes of Nietzsche's Wiederkehr in Kafka. Parody Nietzsche's "first language"?as he called the narrative voice he created for his Zarathustra (cf. EH, 717)?was a child of many parents. It was not so much a 17.

Hence Zara thustra's foremost fear: the fear of being imitated, of being aped. The "foaming fool" Zarathustra meets at the gate of the great city?"whom the people called 'the ape of Zarathustra' "?"had learned from him something of the expression and modulation of language, and perhaps liked also to borrow from the store of his wisdom." The fool tries to imitate not only Zarathustra's language but also his crucial step, the act of dissociation from the multitude: "Why would you wade through this mire? Have pity upon your foot! Spit rather on the gate of the city, and?turn back!" Zarathustra's ethics of danger?striving to over come the doomed species of man at any risk?is perverted here into a merely aesthetic reaction of disgust. Being aped, then, is the occupational risk of the prophet, the most probable cause of his typical employment injury: "But your fool's words injure me, even when you are right. And even if Zarathustra's words were a thousand times right, still you would always do wrong with my words" (TSZ, 178). Kafka's initial expression as a writer is, at first glance, Zarathustra's nightmare come true. Kafka wrote the first version of his "Description of a Struggle" in 1904 and 1905, and though the ape was still a student then, his mockery is already scrambling a considerable variety of voices, most promi nently Hugo von Hofmannsthal's "Lord Chandos Letter." Nevertheless, the "Description" is first of all a grandiose parody of Nietzsche's Zarathustra at all levels (frame, plot, scenic detail, and logic of development). The blueprint for Kafka's opening scene is a passage from the Unfashionable Observation on Schopenhauer where Nietzsche draws a distinction between "great men" and "cultured men": "There is . . . something gripping about their manner of simulating happiness, since their happiness is so absolutely impossible to grasp. We are not even tempted to ask them, as Tannh?user asks Biterolf: 'What plea sures have you ever enjoyed, poor thing?' For alas, we know better, we know otherwise. A winter's day is upon us, and we live high up in the mountains, dangerously and in poverty" (EH, 198; trans, rev.). Kafka's first hero, the nar rator of the "Description," is not an example of Nietzsche's "solitary animal of prey"; he is not a "lion" or "great man" but a Nietzschean "stealthy nibbler" (Naschkatze)}9 that is, a "small man," diminished by virtue. On a winter's day, at a dinner party somewhere in the old town of Prague, a solitary bachelor sits at his table and enjoys wine and a stock of fancy cakes he has selected 19. "And these rooms and chambers," Zarathustra marvels at the small men's architecture, "can men go in and out of them? They look to me as if made for silken dolls; or for stealthy nibblers who probably let themselves be nibbled stealthily" (TSZ, 167).</page><page sequence="10">92 Kafka's Files and piled up in front of him. An acquaintance approaches him and apologizes that he can't hold back his happiness ("my happiness just cannot be con tained, I can't help it") about his latest erotic adventure. While the acquain tance begins to reveal all sorts of graphic details, the narrator feels shame in view of some eavesdroppers curiously approaching them, and pretends a consensus on breaking up: "All right then, if you insist, I'll go with you, but I repeat: it's ridiculous to climb up the Laurenziberg now, in winter and in the middle of the night. Besides, it's freezing . . . and the roads out there are like skating rinks."20 At first glance Kafka's mockery aims at the verti cal dimension?the category of size in Nietzsche's imagery. While Zarathus tra's mountains shrink to Laurenziberg, a hilly park in Prague's Mala Strana, the narrator, not a great man but a tall man, apes great Zarathustra's lament about living among small ones: " 'Oh when shall I get back to my homeland, where I need no longer stoop?no longer stoop before those who are smallT? And Zarathustra sighed and looked into the distance" {TSZ, 167). On their way to Laurenziberg, Kafka's narrator suddenly is ashamed of the difference in size between him and his acquaintance: "It occurred to me that perhaps my long body displeased him by making him feel so small. And this thought? although it was late at night and we hardly met a soul?tormented me so much that while walking I bent my back until my hands reached my knees" (DS, 16). While the narrator now not only talks but also walks like an ape, the actual goal of the parody moves into focus. Simply replacing Zarathustra's wild and dangerous mountains with Laurenziberg and the risk to catch cold or slip and sprain an ankle could easily be read as a reminder of the impossi bility of romantic transgression in modern civilization. But as soon as Kafka's wanderers arrive at the foot of Laurenziberg, Zarathustra's country comes back with a vengeance. The narrator is getting bored with his companion and lets himself be carried away into seemingly fantastic diversions. These diver sions, however, are nothing but a precise experimental verification of Nietz sche's topology of danger and security. The first one, "Ride," starts off from Zarathustra's accident-warning to the higher man: "If you would go high, use your own legs. Do not let yourselves be carried up; do not sit on the backs and heads of others. But you mounted a horse? You are now riding quickly up to your goal? All right, my friend! But your lame foot is sitting on the horse, too" (TSZ, 290). Kafka's ride is a first example of his technique of safety-checking 20. Franz Kafka, "Description of a Struggle," trans. Tania Stern and James Stern, in The Com plete Short Stories, ed. Nahum N. Glatzer (London: Vintage, 1999), 9-10. Hereafter cited as DS.</page><page sequence="11">Benno Wagner 93 metaphors by taking them literally. And again the interaction between the narrator and his acquaintance is at once a precise model and a parody of the interaction between Kafka and Nietzsche. The narrator leaps on the back of his acquaintance, using him as a horse: "The road on which I was riding was stony and rose considerably, but just this I liked and I let it become still stonier and steeper. As soon as my acquaintance stumbled I pulled him up by the col lar and the moment he sighed I boxed his head" (DS, 21). By creating and modifying the mountainous landscape according to his moods, Kafka's nar rator projects to the discourse of his creator Nietzsche a vital epistemic qual ity that Zarathustra ascribes to the mountains: in the mountains, Zarathustra says, "all things come caressingly to your discourse and flatter you, for they want to ride on your back. On every parable you ride to every truth" (TSZ, 183). Kafka's joystick game simply demonstrates that the mountains them selves are a parable, too; that their power of freely creating truths becomes self-referential or paradoxical. Of course, this paradox can easily be unfolded when one remembers where Nietzsche wrote his Zarathustra?in Sils-Maria, in the mountains.21 This explains how Kafka's narrator can easily ignore another warning he receives from Zarathustra: "But your lame foot is sitting on the horse too! When you reach your goal, when you jump from your horse?on your very height, you higher man, you will stumble!" (TSZ, 290). The second diversion, "Walk," connects immediately to this: "But since, as a pedestrian, I dreaded the effort of climbing the mountainous road, I let it become gradually flatter" (DS, 22). While Kafka's first-person narrator almost step for step keeps walk ing in Zarathustra's tracks, his epistemic allotria changes to a more dramatic tone in the third diversion, "The Fat Man." "An enormously fat man," with all the features of a Buddha, is now being carried through the bushes on the banks of a river. This is the introduction to a bizarre safety protocol on the danger of "great men." It begins with the fat man's "address to the landscape," another test of Zarathustra's promises?"Honestly and openly may you here talk to all things: and verily, it sounds as praise in their ears, for one to talk to all things directly!" When the fat man has finished his world-denying exercise ("This 21. I have demonstrated elsewhere that Kafka's reflexive twist of Nietzsche's perspectivism clearly reflects Kafka's cross-reading of Zarathustra with Ernst Mach's Analysis of Sensations (Benno Wagner, "Zarathustra auf dem Laurenziberg: Qu?telet, Nietzsche und Mach mit Kafka," in Literarische Experimentalkulturen: Poetologien des Experiments im 19. Jahrhundert, ed. Marcus Krause and Nicolas Pethes [W?rzburg: K?nigshausen und Neumann, 2005], 225-40). Right from the start, this is to say, Kafka's poetic language is based not on some phantasmic whimsy but on the most advanced discourses exploring the borderland between the humanities and science.</page><page sequence="12">94 Kafka s Files landscape disturbs my thought") (DS, 25-27), his fate follows a prediction Nietzsche once made in view of Schopenhauer, his other example of world denying "under the spell and delusion of morality" (BGE, 258): namely, "that the man Schopenhauer will go under" (UO, 184-85; trans, rev.). This change of plot is connected to a change of metaphor. Whereas the fat man by his speech to nature had been able to make mountains move, he starts to drown when he orders the bearers to carry him through the river. His trust in the river ("But with you, river, I am so delighted that I will let myself be carried through your supple water") would have been shattered had he read Zarathustra on "self-overcoming": Your will and your values you have placed on the river of becoming; and what the people believe to be good and evil, that betrays to me an ancient will to power. . . . Now the river carries your bark farther; it has to carry it. It avails nothing that the broken wave foams and angrily opposes the keel. Now the river is your danger and the end of your good and evil, you who are wisest, but that will itself, the will to power?an unexhausted procre ative will of life. (TSZ, 113-14) While the four bearers, small men as it were, drown as soon as they enter the river, the fat man is at first floating helplessly. The narrator, for his part, fol lows Nietzsche's script for the theoretical man. "It is certainly the sign of the 'breach' of which everyone speaks as the fundamental malady of modern culture," Nietzsche writes in The Birth of Tragedy, "that the theoretical man, alarmed and dissatisfied at his own consequences, no longer dares entrust himself to the terrible icy current of existence: he runs timidly up and down the bank. So thoroughly has he been pampered by his optimistic views that he no longer wants to have anything whole, with all of nature's cruelty attach ing to it" (113). Kafka lets this dramatic image return as a slapstick scene: I got up and in hectic leaps I zigzagged over the stony slope separating me from the water. I paid no heed to the danger, was concerned only with help ing the fat man. ... I ran so recklessly that I couldn't stop, and was forced to dash into the splashing water, coming to a halt only when the water reached my knees. ... I crept quickly up the slope [sol as to be able to accompany the fat man. . . . And perhaps I could learn something about the dangers of this seemingly safe country. (DS, 27-28) To "learn something about the dangers of this seemingly safe country"?this is a crucial phrase in Kafka's oeuvre, an early proclamation of his poetics of</page><page sequence="13">Benno Wagner 95 accident and the unique literary genre it is based on, his intensive protocols. And it sheds new light on another crucial quote. In October 1907 Kafka writes four statements to a young lady in Vienna: "I am in the Assicurazioni Generali [1] and have some hopes of someday sitting in chairs in faraway countries, looking out of the office windows at fields of sugar or Mohammedan cemeter ies [2]; and the whole world of insurance itself interests me greatly [3], but my present work is dreary [4]."22 Though the quote as a whole has gained some prominence in Kafka scholarship, statement 3 has been ignored to this day. Meanwhile, the first has been accepted as a biographical fact, the second as evidence of young Kafka's exoticism, and the last as the key to understanding the relevance of his professional work for his writerly existence: the office as his lasting burden, an obstacle to inspiration, distracting him from writing Judgment after Judgment after Judgment. "Insurance itself interests me greatly": after all we have gone through to this point, we can understand the importance of this statement. Insurance is a magic word for Kafka, the poetological shibboleth that triggers the meta morphosis of the theoretical man, helplessly trying to explore the dangers of Nietzsche country, to the practical man, an expert on risk and safety not in simile but in life. Kafka's work as an insurance clerk is far more to him than a nolens volens economic necessity. It is a poetological source of outstand ing importance, enabling him, for example, to proceed from aping Nietzsche to deconstructing him. Deconstruction Nietzsche's "overman" is a figure of absolute and irreversible transgression. Its point of origin is a distinction created by an act of dissociation: the dis tinction between the "herd man" and all those (individuals) who are able to put themselves at a distance to the herd (or multitude), that is, "special men" (Sondermenschen) of various kinds, prophets and pretenders to the overman. When Nietzsche's discourse emerged, however, this distinction was already obsolete, an epistemic archaism. In his Physique sociale of 1835, the Belgian statistician and astronomer Adolphe Qu?telet had developed a radically new concept of man and society, a concept that was at the same time the keystone of social insurance. To find out the truth about man, Qu?telet claimed, one had to divest him of his individuality and to reaggregate him as an accumu lation of abstract qualities of a given population (such as size, age, behavior, 22.

Rich ard Winston and Clara Winston (New York: Schocken, 1977), 35.</page><page sequence="14">96 Kafka s Files risk). The result of this statistical operation, the "average man," is neither a model nor a blueprint of empirical men but their common reference (a refer ence not of semiotic but of mathematical nature). He is, Qu?telet explains in a later book, a "mysterious tie that allows us to consider every individual as a necessary element of the whole, a tie that shrinks from us physically and can be perceived only with the eyes of science."23 Nothing is more true than the exclamation of contemporary anthropocentric critics of this concept: "This alleged man cannot possibly exist."24 It is, indeed, the very nonexistence of the average man that brings forth his unlimited power of definition. He defines a field of pure immanence, intransgressible, without an outside. He embraces all qualities of individuals and individuals of all qualities, be they prophets, heroes, criminals, freaks, or ordinary men. Nietzsche's disappointed note on Paul R?e?"the average man of this day is my greatest enemy"25?probably marks his greatest insight and his greatest error. In Nietzsche's discourse, the average man is an anthropomorphic "type" or "character" and as such is opposed to the genius. "In ordinary 'Egotism,'" a typical note in the posthu mous writings runs, "it is exactly the nonego, the deep average being, that wants to support itself?and this is revolting, if it is realized by the rarer ones, the less average ones. For their judgment is: 'We are the noble ones! Our preservation imports more than the one ofthat cattle.' "26 It is Kafka, the ape, who will redeem the second meaning of Nietzsche's hostile note. To begin with, Kafka already had been introduced to the average man in his "theoretical man" days, when he was still a student of law at Charles Uni versity. In the winter term of 1903-4, shortly before he started working on the "Description," he heard a course of lectures by Hans Gross, the founding father of modern, statistics-based criminology; in the following year he studied polit ical statistics and Austrian statistics under the prominent national statistician Heinrich Rauchberg. At least the latter courses would have costarred Qu?telet, by then already a classic in his field, alongside the average man.27 So it is probably no coincidence that (1) Kafka started aping Zarathustra only after 23.

The grand finale of the narrator's imaginary ego takes off from two Nietzschean lessons: first, "In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak: but for that one must have long legs. Aphorisms should be peaks?and those who are addressed, tall and lofty" (TSZ, 40); second, "It has been the peculiar task of great thinkers to be lawgivers as to the measure, mint and weight of things" (UO, 193; trans, rev.). In the "Description," along with a literal deterritorialization of the imaginary Nietzschean landscape, we witness a deterritorialization of the narrator's body: "But my legs, my impossible legs lay upon the timbered mountains throwing shadows on valleys and villages. They grew and grew. . . . Please, you passers by, please tell me how tall I am. Measure my arms and legs for me" (DS, 46-47). The point is obvious here. The long-legged "great man," or listener to Zarathustra, appears as a miserable freak who, far from being a "lawgiver as to measures," begs the multitude, the herd men to measure him for assurance of his self and insurance of his life. Kafka obviously knew his Qu?telet by that time. But only, as must be remembered, in theory. In practice, he met him only after his attention shifted from leisurely life on Laurenziberg or Nietzsche's mountains to the world of industrial labor. Workers' accident insurance is probably the best possible place to make one understand immediately the epistemological implications of the concept of the average man. For I've got so much to do! In my four districts. . . people fall off the scaf folds as if they were drunk, or fall into the machines, all the beams topple, all embankments give way, all ladders slide, whatever people carry up falls down, whatever they hand down they stumble over. And I have a headache from all these girls in the porcelain factories who incessantly throw them selves down the stairs with mounds of dishware.29 This is neither slapstick nor expressionism. It is the visualization of an invis ible: of the average man of industrial life or, in Fran?ois Ewald's words, of professional risk, "this unique reality of an orderly evil so to speak, an evil that is neutral against individual behavior."30 In the age of social statistics and insurance, accident develops a second mode of existence: not only as an indi vidual fate but also as a statistical function. 28.

Ewald, Vorsorgestaat, 21.</page><page sequence="16">98 Kafka's Files This insight marks the difference between Kafka the theoretical man and Kafka the practical man. To assess its consequences for Kafka's mode of writing, we have to proceed to the year 1917. By that time Kafka was a social insurance expert of considerable standing, and Nietzsche's dynamite had been involved in a first major explosion. The first development, Kafka's professional expertise, is the matrix for two closely interrelated protocols on overcoming. The first one, "The Hunter Gracchus," deals with the traditional Christian procedure. In pursuit of a chamois, Gracchus slips, falls into a ravine, and dies. Having lost his life, though, Gracchus falls victim to another accident, this time of transportation. His bark fails to find the passage to the beyond, condemning him to an eternal and aimless voyage on worldly waters, and he bemoans his fate to anyone willing to listen. On the level of aping, a reader of Nietzsche immediately identifies four different allusive links. First of all, the story of Gracchus, a miserable neurasthenic, is a grandiose staging of a Nietzs chean "religious neurosis," namely, of the very "repentance and redemption training" that entail "tremendous epileptic epidemics" as well as "terrible paralyses and protracted states of depression" (GM, 578-79). Second, we find a precise warrant of arrest for Gracchus in Zarathustra's description of one of several false pretenders to the overman, the "preachers of death": "They would like to be dead, and we should welcome their wish. Let us beware of waking the dead and disturbing these living coffins! ... Shrouded in thick melancholy and eager for the little accidents that bring death, thus they wait with clenched teeth" (TSZ, 45). Third, the narrative of the hunter imitates the neurasthenic stance of Zarathustra's shadow: "Do I have a goal any more? A haven toward which my sail is set? A good wind? Alas, only he who knows where he is sail ing also knows which wind is good and the right wind for him. What is left to me now? A heart, weary and impudent; a restless will, flutter-wings, a broken backbone" (TSZ, 274). The key event of the Gracchus plot, however, is exactly one of those "little accidents that bring death" which are the target of Zarathus tra's sneer. As a matter of fact, the hunter's accident connects to one of the most vital and energetic appearances of Zarathustra himself. In his second "Dancing Song," Zarathustra addresses life like this: "That is a dance up high and down low: I am the hunter; would you be my dog or my doe? Alongside me now! And swift, you malicious leaping belle! Now up and over there! Alas, as I leaped I fell. Oh, see me lying there, you prankster, suing for grace. I should like to walk with you in a lovelier place" (TSZ, 225).31 31. Naturally, the German original has Gemse (chamois)?the animal Gracchus was in pursuit of on his last workday?where Kaufmann's translation has "doe."</page><page sequence="17">Benno Wagner 99 Already at the level of parody, Gracchus revokes Nietzsche's crucial act of dissociation or distinction by reuniting Zarathustra, his shadow, and the neurasthenic epileptic Christian penitent in one plot. Still more important, though, is Kafka's subtle transcription of Zarathustra's accident to the discur sive scheme of accident insurance. His accident is the result of wanton play ing around?legally speaking, a case o? culpa dolo pr?xima. Any "shallows" insurance company, like Kafka's, would have denied compensation on account of gross negligence. Fortunately, Zarathustra, a Nietzschean offspring, is insured by his mountains. Kafka's descendant, Gracchus, has to go through the same bureaucratic procedure as any of his creator's professional clients. He has to report his accident at the mayor's office (though not?at least a small privilege of descent?to a subordinate clerk but to the mayor of Riva himself), and he has to settle the question of responsibility to claim his compensation. His report is a typical detailed description (Hergangsbeschreibung) as prescribed by the corresponding statistical form (which, by the way, Kafka's institute had devel oped for the whole of Austria): "Everything happened in good order. I pursued, I fell, bled to death in a ravine, died, and this ship should have conveyed me to the next world."32 The "order" Gracchus is referring to is, of course, not an order of craftsmanship but a statistical one. It is the order of the average acci dent, of normal professional risk, an order that exempts from guilt and liabil ity ("I followed my calling as a hunter in the Black Forest. . . . was there any guilt in that?" [HG, 229-30]) and justifies a claim for compensation. The claim of the dead hunter, though?the passage to the beyond and redemp tion?is beyond the compensation scheme of worldly insurance; the mayor's name, Salvatore, is one of Kafka's blind windows. The hunter's average-man strategy of insisting on the fault of another (orderly) employment accident? " 'But then, whose is the guilt?'?'The boatman's_My death ship lost its way; a wrong turn of the wheel, a moment's absence of mind on the pilot's part' " (HG, 228, 230)?necessarily fails here; it must fail precisely because the aver age man, as a statistical function, is beyond guilt and innocence. The average man, that is, has already arrived where Zarathustra and his followers are still trying to get: beyond good and evil. To control and verify this result under varied conditions, Kafka puts another candidate on the trail and trial of overcoming. In his scrapbook, the immediate successor of Gracchus is another reporter, by the name of Rotpeter 32. Franz Kafka, "The Hunter Gracchus," trans. Willa Muir and Edwin Muir, in Complete Short Stories, 229. Hereafter cited as HG.

Red Peter is the joker in Kafka's Nietzsche game. He is aping Zarathustra's ape, Zarathustra, his stepgrandfather Nietzsche, and, last but not least, his true father, Kafka himself. Compared with Gracchus, the mode of overcoming?that is the target of parody?has now been altered. It is not the transitive overcoming of the Christian scheme of redemption but the reflexive self-overcoming of man after the death of god. The script is to be found in Zarathustra's prologue: "All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughing stock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that to the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment" (TSZ, 12). In contrast to the hunter Gracchus, the hunted Red Peter survives his accident. Wounded but not killed by a Hagenbeck hunting expedition, he is, like Gracchus, stuck on a boat (a boat, though, with a destination). Unlike the hunter, the ape is unwilling to follow Zarathustra's shadow by enjoying his "jail" as his "new security" (TSZ, 275). Nevertheless, he is bold enough to deride his role model: "Many a time in variety theatres, waiting for my turn to come on, I have watched some pair of acrobats high up in the roof, performing on their trapezes. . . . 'This, too, is human freedom,' I thought, 'arbitrary movement.' What a mockery of mother nature! No building could withstand the laughter of the assembled apes at a sight like that."33 What is (over)man to the ape? A laughingstock. The ape, then, is not looking for freedom but simply for a way out. And he pursues this way out with the methodical skill worthy of a student of social statistics: I did not work things out; but I did observe everything with complete calm. I watched these men walking up and down, always the same faces, the same movements, often it seemed to me they were one and the same man. So this man or these men were moving about unmolested. A lofty goal began to dawn upon me. No one made me any promise that if I became like them the bars of my cage would be lifted. Such promises, for things that seem incapable of fulfilment, are not given. But make good the fulfilments and the promises will duly appear afterwards, just where you had earlier looked for them in vain.... I had been observing them for a long time before such things occurred to me, indeed it was only the accumulated weight of my observations that pushed me in the right direction. (RA, 192) Again, in Nietzsche's words: "One tries to avoid the will to a goal, the risk to give a goal to oneself." Neither will nor reasoning, but observation and imita 33.

And having observed Kafka for a while now, it is patently clear that "this man or these men" who is/are the object of Red Peter's accu mulated observations is/are the average man/men in the strict sense of social statistics.34 It is "adaptation," then?according to Nietzsche "an activity of the second rank, a mere reactivity" (GM, 515)?that empowers Red Peter to establish an evolutionary world record: "The progress I made! Those rays of knowledge penetrating from every side into my awakening brain! ... By dint of exertions as yet unequalled upon this earth I have attained the cultural level of an average European" (RA, 195). Both Gracchus, the neurasthenic weakling longing for transcendence, and Red Peter, the vigorous superstar of self-overcoming, confirm Kafka's lesson for Nietzsche: the struggle between the overman and the average man is just an episode in the eternal return of the fabulous race between hare and hedgehog.35 Reflection I am now approaching the decisive point of my reading: the idea of Kafka insuring Nietzsche. What Kafka is doing to and for Zarathustra and the over man is more significant than any high-spirited fooling around; it is not merely aesthetic play. Kafka's urge to transcribe insurance discourse into a poetics of accident and of culture insurance can hardly be made plausible without at least mentioning his much-cited "fear." This is by no means a late revisita tion of "good old Franz," the coughing neurasthenic Jewish bachelor, the profitable object of cultural studies. Kafka's fear, Walter Benjamin reminds us, "is not a reaction, but something organic."36 It is not the psychological 34. This is the secret of all of Kafka's heroes: they are variant reindividualizations of the aver age man; their souls are statistical functions (for a more detailed argument see Wagner, "Poseidons Gehilfe," 121-22). 35. To rank Kafka adequately as a reader of Nietzsche, one must keep in mind that many leading Jewish intellectuals of his day had been fascinated by the transgressive temptations of Nietzsche's discourse. Thus his ape report not only entertains a subtle dialogue with Martin Buber's "Three Addresses on Judaism" (public lectures given in Prague between 1909 and 1912, texts that Kafka knew well) but also can be read as a quite specific reply to the desire that young Gershom Scholem entrusted to his wartime diary (which Kafka certainly did not know): the desire to write a "Judenzara thustra." Benjamin Lazier's reading of Scholem's diaries discusses most of the issues that organize the crypto-dialogue between Kafka and Nietzsche ("Writing the 'Judenzarathustra': Gershom Scho lem's Response to Modernity, 1913-1917," New German Critique, no. 85 [2002]: 33-65). 36.

Compared with Nietzsche, Kafka's discursive organization of fear was more complex, because his access to risk, danger, and insurance was not only that of a poet but also that of an expert. If we combine the results of our reading of Kafka's early "Description" with the 1907 statement as to his interest in insurance, it is evident that Kafka must by then have reflected his writerly fate and practice on the conceptual level of our reading. At that time, though, Nietzsche's mountains would have been hardly more than an exercise ground to him. Ten years later, by the time Kafka wrote his hunter and ape reports and another literary protocol, "The Great Wall of China" (or, for a proper translation, "Building the Chinese Wall"), this situa tion had dramatically changed. The blind spot of Nietzsche's discourse, his Achilles' heel to which Red Peter does not fail to allude in his report ("Every one who walks about here on earth feels a tickling in his heels?from the little chimpanzee to the great Achilles" [RA, 187]), had allowed for his off spring to be kidnapped and abused. The vulnerable spot of the prophet of the overman is best described in Nietzsche's most condensed formula of his phi losophy: "My philosophy is inverted Platonism: the further from the truly existent, the purer, the more beautiful, the better."37 Nietzsche was all too aware of the practical consequences of his move. For Plato, the truly existent is the final standard, the (however fictitious) fixed point of reference for his complex procedure of dividing false pretenders from true statesmen or lead ers. Having abandoned this procedure, Nietzsche first must protect his over man against all kinds of pretenders. His substitute for Plato's method of selection is a simple blacklist of false candidates, published in?or rather as?the first book of his Zarathustra: the afterworldly, the despisers of the body, the pale criminal, the preachers of death, and so on. A poor substitute, indeed. The subtitle to Zarathustra, A Book for All and None, can be read as an open confession of his incapability to settle the Platonic question of empow erment and selectivity, his failure, that is, to "store his explosives safely." The politicocultural consequences of this conceptual weakness are well known. Nietzsche's dynamite was proliferated among unskilled workers. "In no time," Hans Magnus Enzensberger writes about the two decades before World War I, "Europe was crowded with supermen. Millions of natural leaders [F?hrer naturen] and extremists were competing for a position in the historical van 37. Friedrich Nietzsche, Nachgelassene Fragmente, 1869-1872, ed. Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari (Berlin: DTV, 1988), 199.</page><page sequence="21">Benno Wagner 103 guard . . . and tried to win over the silent majority, eventually with diminish ing success."38 By 1914 this sometimes bizarre but still comparatively harmless competition for distinction?for "dangerous overcoming," in Zarathustra's terms?is being drafted for war propaganda and, within a few months, becomes a vital element of the transformation of the biostate into the exterministic state. In his influential manifesto, The Ideas of 1914 (first published in 1915 and immediately reviewed by Friedrich Meinecke in one of Kafka's favorite monthlies, Die neue Rundschau), the Swedish geographer Rudolf Kjell?n, a prominent champion of modern geopolitics, argues that the crucial character istic of Nietzsche's overman is not high-spirited individualism but submis sive humility. In Nietzsche, Kjell?n writes, "the overman who bears the heavi est burden represents the idea of elevation [den Exzelsiorgedanken] as opposed to the image of the heap of humans sitting comfortably, mutually searching their backs for lice, the very contented overapes of this world."39 And like Kafka's scrapbook, Kjell?n's "world historical prospect" connects the super ape to the man incapable of death: "For the multitude the art of life consisted in extinguishing, as far as possible, suffering and death: without any other objective than what Chesterton calls Methusalism: adding to life as many empty days as possible." The ultimate perversion of the overman in war pro paganda thus consists in projecting his affirmation of uninsured risk to the multitude. "They do not know," Kjell?n says about the prewar herd men, "the deep earnest in Adolf von Harnack's words at the outbreak of war: 'Wherever life is a true delight, death is close to life.' "40 Michel Foucault has analyzed this collective readiness to put one's life at risk, this transcription of victims into sacrifices, as part of the insurance contract of the Nazi state.41 It is exactly this point, this very movement of perverting social insurance, that is the ori gin and aim of what I am, in a wider context, reconstructing as Kafka's "cul ture insurance."42 38.

"The Bridge," a strange breed of parable and nightmare protocol, is in fact nothing other than a most brilliant and concise safety check for overcoming. Nietzsche's concep tion of man as a rope or bridge to the overman is taken literally here, the bridge functioning as first-person narrator. All the Zarathustrian ingredients are pres ent: from the setting (mountains, unmapped country), via Nietzsche's weak spot, selectivity, and the silly series of candidates ("Who was it? A child? A dream? A wayfarer? A suicide? A tempter? A destroyer?"),43 to pain and suf fering as the basic principle of civilization. And it is the bridge's unwillingness to silently submit to a purpose, it is, briefly, the will to knowledge that causes the catastrophe of the will to power, the turning and collapse of the bridge. Kafka's overape, then, is just another instance of this politics of inverting per version. If the average man has always already arrived at a place the overman only longs to reach by dangerous overcoming, then the projection of the over man on the average man is just an empty tautology; the collective sacrifice of life is pure slaughter or absurd suicide. Two months later, in March 1917, Kafka transposes his reflections on safety in architecture to the historicopolitical scale. Again, he almost step by step moves in Nietzsche's tracks. The choice of the scenario imitates Nietz sche's backward glance at The Birth of Tragedy: "As the thunder of the Battle of Worth was rolling over Europe, the muser and riddle-friend who was to be the father of this book sat somewhere in an Alpine nook . . . and wrote down his thoughts about the Greeks" (BT, 17). Kafka's Chinese enigma, his encod ing of the "thunder" of the Great War, in fact redoubles Nietzsche's move of distantiation, his use of history as a medium to reflect the present. Not only does he choose fifteenth-century China as the scene for his narrative, but his narrator, too, assures his readers (and himself) that his investigations are proceeding from the safe position of the historian: "My inquiry is purely his object (the thing against which something is insured, as in "accident insurance"). The specific quality of Kafka's literature then consists in its sensitivity for the cultural paradoxy resulting from the "unintentional self-endangerment" of modern society (see Ulrich Beck, Risk Society: Toward a New Modernity [Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1994], 176)?for a modern culture that at the same time functions as a means of protection and as a constant source of danger. 43.

First, the Chinese narrator displays an unusual combination of areas of expertise quite similar to that of his creator. It is only due to his hobby horse knowledge that his professional knowledge as an expert for security devices (defense walls, bulwarks) can be made effective for his reflections on home security and political leadership: "During the building of the wall and ever since to this very day I have occupied myself almost exclusively with the comparative history of races?there are certain questions that one can probe to the marrow, as it were, only by this method" (GW, 242). In fact, the com parative history of races is a private preoccupation shared by Kafka's Franz, Kafka's Chinese narrator, Zarathustra, and Nietzsche. Franz's late confession to Felice?"I do not actually strive to be good, to answer to a supreme tribunal. Very much the opposite. I strive to know the entire human and animal com munity, to recognize their fundamental preferences, desires, and moral ideals, to reduce them to simple rules"46?is just one more tag in his ongoing dialogue with Zarathustra?"Zarathustra saw many lands and many peoples: thus he discovered the good and evil of many peoples" (TSZ, 58)?and, via the prophet, with his creator. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche's criticism focuses on the failure of moral philosophers in the comparative history of races?"just 44. Franz Kafka, "The Great Wall of China," trans. Willa Muir and Edwin Muir, in Complete Short Stories, 240-41. Hereafter cited as GW. The Chinese wall was completed in the early period of the Ming dynasty (1403-35). The geopolitical setting of Kafka's two fragments "The Great Wall of China" and "An Old Manuscript" corresponds precisely to the historical settings of the early Ming dynasty and the previous period of the Mongol invasion during the thirteenth century. 45. "It does not suffice for me that the lightning no longer does harm. I do not want to conduct it away: it shall learn?to work for me.?My wisdom has long collected itself like a cloud, it is growing stiller and darker. Thus does every wisdom that shall one day give birth to lightnings.?I do not want to be light for these men of the present, or be called light by them. These men?I want to blind: lightning of my wisdom! put out their eyes!" {TSZ, 300). This is just another striking example of Nietzsche's specific philosophy of risk and danger: of his claim to channel and to use the incalcu lably destructive energy of lightning for his project of a purposeful destruction, that is, to transform a "dangerous" damage into a "risky" one. 46.

"A country of my own, a soil of my own": the delicate question that Kafka's comparative historian poses, far from the thunder and lightnings of World War I, has to do with the relationship between collective safety and political leadership. After World War II a German legal historian summa rized this relationship as follows: The idea of security is the origin of the evolution of all human abilities, of all civilization. It. . . leads man to build himself a sheltering house, and ram parts and walls to defend his house, his camp, or, like in the case of the Limes Germanicus or the Great Wall of China, to defend his country. Thus the idea of security became the father of the crafts, of architecture, of urban develop ment. Medical science together with biology, bacteriology, and hygiene developed for the security of life and health.... The sword and military pro fession were developed as securities against human enemies, economizing, welfare, and insurance as securities against economic damages. The crown of securities, though, is the state, while the law rules over all of them.47 From this point of view, the kinship between Kafka and his Chinese architect is not simply metaphorical but metonymical. Insurance and social hygiene (Kafka) and architecture (the narrator) are two branches of a common (anthro pological) origin, the human desire for security, and they share a common (political) destination: the state. This observation is confirmed if one looks for possible references of the actual threat to Kafka's Chinese people, the bar barous nomads. On the one hand, the Austrian state, Kjell?n writes in 1914, had been founded "for the sake of Europe, as a bulwark for its culture against its dangerous enemies in the east," "as a frontier against the Turks."48 On the other hand, the proverbial T?rkengefahr was the trigger for an obsolete, though most "Kafkaesque" insurance branch: freedom insurance, as defined 47.

As the pro paganda discourse of "general mobilization" did not halt at the gates of an already highly specialized insurance press, Kafka and his colleagues were instructed that "the same basic idea is crucial for building up German social insurance and for the armament of our empire against its outward enemies: a firm, compulsory, well-organized aggregation of precisely defined units; a dili gently applied regulation of all details that is controlled by binding laws to guar antee intervention in the case of necessity and to distribute the responsibility and cost for appropriate measures on many shoulders."50 This statement from the fall of 1916 contains all key elements of Kafka's Chinese scenario from the spring of 1917: the necessity of defense measures against an external enemy; the division of manpower into "armies of labor"; the idea of collectively sharing responsibil ity "shoulder to shoulder"; and the "carefully scrutinized ... decrees of the high command" (GW, 236,238,239). But it also contains a promise that may be con sidered as the decisive provocation for Kafka's Chinese reflections. If, according to von Frankenberg, social insurance served as "a firm bulwark, a gathering place for well-planned defense,"51 then this assurance is not valid for Kafka's China, where the bulwark is being built according to a system of piecemeal construction and where the regulations given by the high command are at least disputable. Hence the question Kafka's narrator is "probing to the marrow": "But how can a wall protect if it is not a continuous structure?" (GW, 235). At this point, we witness one more reunion of the insurance clerk and Nietzsche's first true reader?or, rather, the clash between the two. In the fall of 1908 Kafka exposed, in his first long treatise for his insurance institute, the necessarily fragmentary structure of any legal codification that develops over time. He thereby handily deconstructed the eudaemonistic promise of compre hensive insurance for Austria by the Accident Insurance Law of 1887.52 This was a direct inversion of the programmatic claim Nietzsche proposes in The 49.

Myth alone saves all the powers of the imagination and of the Apollo nian dream from their aimless wanderings."?"The opposite of this happens when a people begins to comprehend itself historically and to smash the myth ical works that surround it" (BT, 135, 137). That Nietzsche's voice in this con text is in fact the primus inter pares among the multitude of partners in Kafka's crypto-dialogues?that Kafka's poetic protocols consciously, systematically, and purposefully respond to Nietzsche?is beyond any reasonable doubt if we have a closer look at the following longer passage from "The Wanderer and His Shadow"?a passage that might be read as an immediate, consoling follow up to the skeptical remarks quoted above: Nonetheless, it is possible that posterity will one day laugh at this anxiety of ours and regard the democratic work of a succession of generations somewhat as we regard the building of stone dams and protective walls?as an activity that necessarily gets lots of dust on clothes and faces and no doubt also unavoidably makes the workers a little purblind and stupid; but who would wish such a work undone on that account! The democratization of Europe is, it seems, a link in the chain of those tremendous prophylactic measures which are the conception of modern times and through which we separate ourselves from the Middle Ages. Only now is it the age of cyclopean building! We finally secure the foundations, so that the whole future can safely build upon them! We make it henceforth impossible for the fruitful fields of culture again to be destroyed overnight by wild and senseless torrents! We erect stone dams and protective walls against barbarians, against pestilences, against physical and spiritual enslavement! And all this coarsely and literally at first, but grad ually in a higher and more spiritual sense, so that all the measures here indi cated seem to be an inspired collective preparation for the supreme artist of horticulture, who will be able to apply himself to his real task only when these preparations have been fully carried out!?To be sure, given the great length of time which lies between means and end, and given the very great effort of mind and body, of effort spanning the centuries, needed even to create or procure each one of these means, we must not hold it too much against those who are working on the present-day if they loudly decree that the wall and the trellis are the end and the final goal; since no one, indeed, can yet see the gardener or the fruit-trees for whose sake the trellis exists.53 53.

Hereafter cited as W.</page><page sequence="27">Benno Wagner 109 At this point I am probing to the marrow my hypothesis: Kafka as Nietzsche's first true reader, as insurance expert for Nietzsche's "first language." Here we find not only the full imagery of Kafka's Chinese scenario (including the elaboration on workmen's psychology) but also the core problems Kafka's narrator has to deal with and, above all, the imagery he, the narrator, is using when discussing these problems. Since Kafka's narrator, like Nietzsche's worker "on the present-day," is unable to identify the purpose of a piecemeal defense wall, he concludes that the wall itself must be that purpose, that, in other words, "the command willed something inexpedient. Strange conclu sion!" (GW, 240). And as in fact the Chinese command remains as invisible as Nietzsche's gardener?"where [their office] was and who sat there no one whom I have asked knew then or knows now" (GW, 239)?there remains the hermeneutic problem of understanding their intention. To explain why this problem cannot be solved but at best be handled properly, the narrator falls back on Nietzsche's hydrologie scenario, "the river in spring," citing a "secret maxim" of "those days": It rises until it grows mightier and nourishes more richly the soil on the long stretch of its banks, still maintaining its own course until it reaches the sea. . .. Thus far may you urge your meditations on the decrees of the high command. But after that the river overflows its banks, loses outline and shape,. . . damages the fields, and yet cannot maintain itself for long in its new expanse, but must run back between its banks again, must even dry up wretchedly in the hot season that follows. Thus far may you not urge your meditations on the decrees of the high command. (GW, 240) This is Kafka's Chinese message at the moment when the Hapsburg Empire is on the verge of breaking apart into newly founded democracies: political leadership, the centralized power of the state is by no means an autonomous, self-contained function (as Nietzsche's caricature seems to suggest); its per formance and effects depend on the ability of the individuals pragmatically to limit their will to knowledge in politics or, using a different image, to observe a dietetics of political reflection. The other image Nietzsche uses to mock the optimistic discourse of democratic progress also returns in Kafka's Chinese reflections: "We finally secure the foundations, so that the whole future can safely build upon them!" Kafka's literary unfolding of this idea points to a major common reference of both Nietzsche and Kafka, the Deutsche Schriften by the Protestant</page><page sequence="28">110 Kafka's Files nationalist theologian Paul de Lagarde.54 In his 1878 essay "Die Religion der Zukunft" Lagarde criticizes the French revolutionaries of 1789 for their imprudent idealism: While they should have studied the plan of the old building in order to assess on the grounds of this knowledge where it had been badly imple mented, while they should have percussed every single stone with a ham mer to hear whether it was still sound and firm or had to be replaced, they relied on their own insight and power, tore down everything and began building all over again, not according to needs, but ideals.55 The Chinese architect's skeptical remark, "How could the wall, which did not form even a circle . . . , provide the foundation for a tower? That could obviously be meant only in a spiritual sense" (GW, 239), picks up Lagarde's criticism as well as Nietzsche's parody ("all this coarsely and literally at first, but gradually in a higher and more spiritual sense") of the confusion of prac tical politics and ideology in the newly emerging welfare state.56 This ideology is also the source of the high-spirited optimism that Kafka's Chinese scholar of architecture displays when he claims that the wall's most famous predecessor in terms of architectural ambition, the Tower of Babel, "was bound to fail because of the weakness of the foundation. In this respect at any rate our age was vastly superior to that ancient one. Almost every educated man of our time was a mason by profession and infallible in the matter of laying foundations" (GW, 238-39). Here Kafka's script enters 54. For Lagarde and Kafka see Benno Wagner, "Zur Geburt des Deutschseins aus dem semi tischen W?stensturm: 'Der Jude' als 'Razziant an arischem Geistesgut,' " in Die nationale Identit?t der Deutschen: Philosophische Imaginationen und historische Mentalit?ten, ed.

The most intimate and contemporary reference for Kafka's Chinese reflections on the physical and the spiritual existence of the state is to be found in the national economist Werner Sombart's widely read war propaganda pamphlet H?ndler und Helden {Traders and Heroes). Sombart sets out to integrate the biopolitics of the Bismarckian welfare state and the thanatopolitics of the "mobilized" military state in one narrative (see below). Drawing a distinction between the English and the German ideas of the state, he maintains that the latter "is rightfully called an organic idea, as opposed to the English mechanic idea, because it conceives of the relation between the individual to the whole in an 'organic' sense, insofar as in a spiritual sense the individuals integrate 'organically' into the spiritual whole. ... In fact the state is also an organism, but a metabiological one, a spiritual organism in which the individuals partake with their spiritual lives" {H?ndler und Helden [Munich: Duncker und Humblot, 1915], 88; hereafter cited as HH). As I shall show below, Kafka's Chinese meta-architecture may be read as an immediate response to Sombart's metabiology.</page><page sequence="29">Benno Wagner 111 into a most intimate dialogue with Nietzsche's criticism of monumental his tory. The peculiar comparison between the Tower and the Wall ("First, then, it must be said that in those days things were achieved scarcely inferior to the construction of the Tower of Babel" [GW, 238]) is an immediate response to Nietzsche's warning: "Monumental history deceives by means of analogies: with seductive similarities it arouses rashness in those who are courageous and fanaticism in those who are inspired" (UO, 100). Thus the image of the Tower of Babel and its diagnostic function audibly respond to Kafka's fore most bible?Nietzsche. In part 8 of Beyond Good and Evil Nietzsche stages a dialogue between two deaf "old patriots," one a partisan of antiquarian, the other of monumental, history. "A statesman," exclaims the former, who piles up for them another tower of Babel, a monster of empire and power, they call "great"; what does it matter that we, more cautious and reserved, do not yet abandon the old faith that only a great thought can give a deed or cause greatness. Suppose a statesman put his people in a position requiring them to go in for "great politics" from now on, though they were ill-disposed for that by nature. . . . such a statesman should be great? Nietzsche makes it very clear that neither the cautious advocate of the "old belief" nor his foolhardy opponent?who shouts, "Perhaps it was insane to want such a thing? But perhaps everything great was merely insane when it started"?should be taken seriously, "considered how soon one stronger will become master over the strong" (BGE, 364-65)?that is, the agent of critical history, powerful enough "to shatter and dissolve a past," "in order to live" (UO, 106). At this point Kafka's protocol branches off from Nietzsche's trail. While it confirms the "madness" of monumental thought?"there were many wild ideas in people's heads at that time?this scholar's book is only one example" (GW, 239), the antiquarian state of mind appears in a different light. Though Kafka's Chinese village dwellers are obviously infected with antiquarian his tory ("Battles that are old history are new to us, and one's neighbor rushes in with a jubilant face to tell the news" [GW, 245]), this infection does by no means end up in the epistemic damage feared by Nietzsche: "Today life no longer rules alone and constrains our knowledge of the past, instead all the boundary markers have been torn down and everything that once was is now collapsing on the human being" (UO, 109). Quite to the contrary?not only is "the result of holding such opinions ... a life on the whole free and uncon strained," but it is even "one of the greatest unifying influences among our</page><page sequence="30">112 Kafka's Files people; indeed, if one may dare to use the expression, the very ground on which we live" (GW, 247). But Kafka's reflection on political power and collective security is not simply a regression to an idyllic version of antiquarian history, to a "federal ist" political imaginary. Instead, the horror represented in and pedagogically functionalized by picture books ("When our children are unruly we show them these pictures [of the terrifying nomads], and at once they fly weeping into our arms" [GW, 241]) breaks free in a medium of quite a different status. In Kafka's scrapbook, the reflections of the Chinese architect are almost immediately followed by an eyewitness report that according to a subsequent note the narrative had been translated from a fragment of an old manuscript. The home security report of the Chinese architect ("the land is too vast and would not let them reach us, they would end their course in the empty air" [GW, 241]) is bluntly revoked here, while the narrative voice has shifted from a state employee to a man from the crowd, a cobbler who notes that the square before the emperor's palace is occupied by armed soldiers: "They are obvi ously nomads from the North. In some way that is incomprehensible they have pushed right into the capital, although it is a long way from the frontier."57 Here, too, it is possible to correlate the setting of the scene with Chinese his tory. While Peking, the capital of Ming China and of the architect's report, was situated close to the northern borderland, Nanking, the capital of the Sung dynasty, which was swept away by the Mongolian occupation in the thirteenth century, was located in the south, a long way from the frontier. It is a historical document, then, that disturbs the happy historicist equilibrium of the archi tect's report and the comfortable horror of the picture books?historical, though, not in content but in physical status. This narrative maneuver of dissimulation?the reentry of history into the present through an eyewitness report?aims not at Nietzsche in the first place but at one of his illegitimate heirs, pretenders of Zarathustra at the beginning of World War I. "The war of 1914 is Nietzsche's war. ... Germany is inspired by Nietzschean spirit," Werner Sombart writes in H?ndler und Helden (53). Like the preachers of the "ideas of 1914," Sombart is trying to transcribe Nietzsche's criticism of the welfare state and biopolitics into a legitimation of the Prussian military state and its thanatopolitics. The suc cessors of herd man and overman, trader and hero, are now collective cul tural types who represent "the opposite poles of human orientation on earth" 57. Franz Kafka, "An Old Manuscript," trans. Willa Muir and Edwin Muir, in Complete Short Stories, 416. Hereafter cited as OM.</page><page sequence="31">Benno Wagner 113 (HH, 64) and who happen to coincide with the English and the German national characters. While the trader, like Nietzsche's last man, strives for a secure and comfortable life, the overman is once again perverted and drafted for military service: Sombart's hero "wants to give, he wants to waste him self, to sacrifice himself" (HH, 64)?nota bene, to the warfaring state and its life-devouring military machine. "It looks as if much had been neglected in our country's system of defense" (OM, 415). The first sentence of Kafka's old manuscript not only revokes the Chinese architect's security protocol but also functions as a sar castic confirmation of Goethe's aphorism as quoted by Sombart to illustrate the heroic stance regarding duty: "Duty fulfilled still regards itself as debt because one has never done enough" (HH, 64). In fact, the behavior of the Chinese population in the cobbler's report carefully follows Sombart's trader script. The trader cannot conceive of the state otherwise than as a "mutual insurance institute" or, in Novalis's words, as a "pillow of indolence" (HH, 75). He tends accordingly to think about armed conflict, as Sombart proves by quoting from Herbert Spencer's Principles of Ethics: "Where the invading force is overwhelming, such sacrifice of individuals is not justified. . . . The soldier . . . puts his life at risk, while the rest of the population accept deduc tions from their earnings to support the army" (HH, 34).58 In Kafka's occu pation report, this mentality carries on even in the situation of utter defeat. To pacify the nomads and their carnivorous horses, the craftsmen and mer chants establish an elementary mutual insurance: "The butcher is nervous and does not dare to stop his deliveries of meat. We understand that, how ever, and subscribe money to keep him going. If the nomads got no meat, who knows what they may think of" (OM, 417). And even Novalis's pillow would not get lost in Kafka's transcription (though typically displaced not under the head of its owner, but on top of it). One day, the butcher, trying to get around the labor of slaughtering, delivered a live ox to the nomads: "But he will never dare to do that again. I lay for a whole hour flat on the floor at the back of my workshop with my head muffled in all the clothes and rugs and pillows I had, simply to keep from hearing the bellowing of that ox" (OM, 417). Sombart's conjuration of German heroism ("we are a people of warriors" [HH, 85]) is completely disenchanted here (though by a Bohemian in Chinese disguise). When the imperial military power has resigned, the emperor is deprived of his second, imaginary body ("mighty throughout all 58. The first half-sentence is quoted from Spencer, pt. 4, chap. 9; the rest refers to a passage from chap. 29. Sombart obviously quotes from memory; hence my translation.</page><page sequence="32">114 Kafkas Files the hierarchies of the world" [GW, 243]) and left with his first, empirical one: otherwise invisible to the Chinese citizens, he now appears at his palace win dows, "watching with bent head the goings-on before his residence" (OM, 417). And these goings-on are merely a repetition of this lesson on power and representation on the level of the collective body of the people. Completely deprived of its heroic dimension, it is reduced to empirical existence. This, then, is Kafka's reply to Sombart in shorthand: "It is left to us artisans and trades men to save our country; but we are not equal to such task; nor have we ever claimed to be capable of it. This is a misunderstanding of some kind; and it will be the ruin of us" (OM, 417). Even outside the paper body of Kafka's scrapbook, "The Great Wall of China" and "An Old Manuscript" are inseparably related to each other. Rather than two individual "stories,"59 they form two integral parts of one safety pro tocol. They reflect, displaced in time and space, the core paradox of political power in the modern state at a vital moment of its history. The praise of the weak mode of imaginary totalization and the cautioning against going too far in the search for the core or substance of political power in the first part (the architect's protocol) seem to be disproved by the criticism of the weakness of imperial power implied in the second part (the cobbler's protocol). Though Nietzsche's criticism of antiquarian and of monumental history resounds in Kafka's Chinese reflections, the tension between the two remains unresolved here: there is neither a dialectic nor a vitalistic synthesis in sight, no critical historian, no dangerous and endangered individual who would be able to break and dissolve the past for the sake of new life. In the spring of 1917, while the multiethnic Hapsburg Empire is facing the choice between a regression to authoritarian centralism and being swept away by the strong and multiple movements toward national independence of its subterritories, Kafka rejects an invitation to join an artists' association for "Great Austria" with a precise inversion of Sombart's formula of the "organic state,"60 namely, on the grounds that he cannot envisage "a homogeneous Great Austria," much less imagine himself "completely integrated into that spiri tual whole"; "from such a decision" he shrinks.61 The two "stories" about the Chinese Empire that Kafka begins to write down on the very next page of his scrapbook also avoid "such a decision." They offer no instructions or doctrines for the contemporary situation but instead a complex image for reflection, a 59.

Does this mean, then, that Kafka himself at last complies with Sombart's type of the trader and his idea of equilibrium, with the "image of the scales the shopkeeper holds in his hand to weigh raisins and pepper?" (HH, 39). Certainly not. In a post-Hapsburg Chinese protocol, Kafka himself has produced the image that best describes the synoptic effect of his two contradictory Chinese reports: "We live on this razor's edge ... : The sole visible and indubitable law that is imposed upon us is the nobility, and must we ourselves deprive ourselves ofthat one law?"62 The equilibrium Kafka suggests is not the result of mechanical calculation, it is not "in the hand" of an external observer; instead, it is an existential challenge, a challenge that waives any distinction between observers and agents. Association How can such a challenge be met, how can it be met by means of writing, by the specific potentials of literature? Here, too, it seems pertinent to have a look at Nietzsche first. In number 284 of "The Wanderer and His Shadow" Nietzsche reflects on the psychology of militarism and pacifism, of strength and weakness in politics: The means to real peace.?No government nowadays admits that it main tains an army so as to satisfy occasional thirsts for conquest; the army is supposed to be for defense. That morality which sanctions self-protection is called upon to be its advocate. But that means to reserve morality to oneself and to accuse one's neighbor of immorality, since he has to be thought of as ready for aggression and conquest if our own state is obliged to take thought of means of self-defense; moreover, when our neighbor denies any thirst for aggression just as heatedly as our state does, and protests that he too main tains an army only for legitimate self-defense, our declaration of why we require an army declares our neighbor a hypocrite and cunning criminal who would be only too happy to pounce upon a harmless and unprepared victim and subdue him without a struggle. This is how all states now con front one another: they presuppose an evil disposition in their neighbor and a benevolent disposition in themselves. This presupposition, however, is a piece of inhumanity as bad as, if not worse than, a war would be. (W, 380) Nietzsche's profound criticism of the modern doctrine of self-defense allows for a precise demonstration of the writing strategy described in the title of 62. Franz Kafka, "The Problem of Our Laws," trans. Willa Muir and Edwin Muir, in Complete Short Stories, 438.</page><page sequence="34">116 Kafka's Files this essay: Kafka insuring Nietzsche. The escape route the latter has to offer out of the demoralizing process of an armed peace is, as always, lofty and incalculable: To disarm while being the best armed, out of an elevation of sensibility? that is the means to a real peace, which must always rest on a disposition for peace: whereas the so-called armed peace such as now parades about in every country is a disposition to fractiousness. . . . The tree of the glory of war can be destroyed only at a single stroke, by a lightning-bolt: lightning, however, as you well know, comes out of a cloud and from on high. (W, 380-81) While Kafka's architect protocol obviously takes off from the same mental disposition at which Nietzsche's criticism is aiming, his cobbler's protocol seems to reject not only Nietzsche's high-spirited solution but also any other way out of the dilemmatic choice between moral destruction by a powerful, centralized state or physical destruction by an outward enemy. Kafkas clouds carry no lightnings, indeed. His solution to the dilemma of modern power does not come from "up high" but from "down below," from the people or the "souls of almost all the provinces" (GW, 247). It is not a philosophical but a poetic solution, a culture insurance contract that becomes visible at the intersection of the horizontal or narrative dimension of his protocols and their vertical dimension, the "dialogue" (Mikhail Bakhtin) or the "paragrammatic" (Julia Kristeva). Here, the field of the voices resounding within Kafka's text extends far beyond Nietzsche, his permanent companion. And it is here that Kafka's decisive move against Nietzsche's "first language" becomes visible: insuring Nietzsche, not as a metaphor but as a writerly practice or device. This practice or device shifts into focus if we observe the rule of postrep resentationalist ethnography while reading Kafka, that is, if we "stop giving prime attention to the meaning of signs, to their representational contents, in order to focus instead on their practical effects."63 In Nietzsche, then, metaphor functions as an instance of dissociation: it envisages and confirms the distinc 63.

In Kafka, this function is inverted: his texts produce an intricate network of allusions that entangles even the most conflicting social, cultural, or political identifications. His ape, for example, is marked by two scars originating from his capture: one in the face, pointing to the "German" wound, the dueling scar, and one below the hip, pointing to the "Jewish" wound of circumcision. His literary origin (the tales of Wilhelm Hauff and E. T. A. Hoffmann) is that of an Englishman, while his goal is to become like a European. At the same time, Red Peter more than obviously has been copied and pasted from the writings of Charles Darwin, Ernst Haeckel, and Alfred Brehm, thus signifying humanity (not in a Christian or idealist sense but in the biologistic sense of evolutionism). And of course, Red Peter's report in many details reflects his creator's biography and the general situation of art and the artist in modern society. It is this accumulation of heterogeneous sets of references through imita tion or allusion that I call the file function of Kafka's images (in distinction to the protocol function of his narratives).64 Culture insurance, then, is the transcrip tion from mathematics to semiotics of the basic operation of social insurance: namely, the association and integration of as many risks as possible under one calculus.65 The calculus organizing the ape file?the lesson the ape teaches?is not the identity but the ontological indistinguishability of the overman and the overape or, in the words of post-1914 Nietzscheanism, of "us" and "the others." The same procedure, then, is the way out of Kafka's Chinese dilemma, the answer of the poet and insurance clerk to the philosopher. In the paragram matic dimension of his narrative (the file function) the demoralizing mental pattern of armed peace is transformed from a medium of dissociation to a medium of association. Kafka's "stories" invite any of the parties in the multi dimensional conflict in the spring of 1917 to identify themselves with the Chi nese, and their opponents with the nomads. Hence they place seeds of doubt as to the truth of that reading in all of them. At the same time, the Chinese file clearly points to material for a "psychoanalytic" reading (on the level of the individual as well as of society), for a series of "politicocultural" readings (the nomads display traits of anti-Semites, of Hasidic Jews, of Jews "in general," of Slavs, and even of bloodthirsty "ritual murder" journalists,66 with correspond ing "Chinese" identities), and of course for an aesthetic reading along the track 64.

At this point, however, my argument reaches the border to another "land of my own," a new approach toward reading Kafka: file analysis.67 Unlike Kafka's first editor, his "first reader" would have to grasp the para mount importance as well as the precise function of "Nietzsche" for Kafka's writerly project. Their common ground is a twofold probl?matique: first, the biopolitical occupation of life by the emerging welfare state and the uninsur able risks implied in this process; second, the mediopolitical occupation of language by journalism and political propaganda (Nietzsche-Schopenhauer's "Shoddy Jargon of Today" [UO, 70]). From the corresponding loss of control over life and language springs the common fear of Nietzsche, the "fearful eagle," and Kafka, the "fearful mole." Their responses to that fear, however, could hardly be more different. While Nietzsche's vitalistic project of a "first language" tries to bring language to life (a move to which Hofmannsthal's much-cited "Lord Chandos Letter" is merely a "decadent" echo), Kafka moves in the opposite direction. His narratives bring life to language', they are inten sive protocols of the discursive modes of existence in modern society: from the widespread discourse of biopolitics via biographism to nationalized vital ism. Kafka, the expert in modern biopolitics, inverts Nietzsche's plea for a "physiology of aesthetics" (GM, 548) into the program of an aesthetics of phys iology. He is the first among modern writers fully to understand the twofold existence of the average man: his life in the physical body of the individual and in the statistical body of society. But if it is true that Kafka could become Nietzsche's first reader because of his practical knowledge in the field of bio politics, it must also be remembered that he obviously had understood the key importance of the average man as the blind spot?and not the opponent?of the overman already by the time he studied social statistics. It was this star tling insight that raised his early interest in social insurance. The latter, then, must be considered as a tool for his investigations rather than a random factor of "influence," a "source of inspiration," a "field of experience," and so on. The first-person narrator in "Description of a Struggle," as he helplessly runs up and down the bank of the river of annihilation, may be read as a self-parody of young Kafka. Once he has moved beyond reading Nietzsche from the view point of a theoretical man, Kafka's somewhat aimless parody of Nietzsche's 67.1 shall try to elaborate on this in the second part of a three-volume work: Kafka's Files (vol. 1, A Poetics of Accident; vol. 2, Literature as Culture Insurance; vol. 3, The Uninsurahle: The Tra jectory of the Artist).</page><page sequence="37">Benno Wagner 119 poetics of dangerous life gains depth, complexity, and direction. In 1917, when Nietzsche's "unfashionable" diagnosis of the time has been perverted into a most "fashionable" element of contemporary discourse (war propaganda, that is), we observe how Kafka's series of accident protocols simultaneously decon struct Nietzsche's "pathos of distance" by reminding the overman of the aver age man, his intransgressible homeland; reflect his investigations on the utility and liability of history for life; and associate the exclusive voice of Nietz sche's "first language" with a multitude of voices and thus with the voice of the multitude. Kafka's answer to Nietzsche's highly selective "first language" is a "last language" that apes the distinctive and stigmatizing metaphors of biopolitical and war propaganda only to invert their function: from media of selection and collective sacrifice to media of inclusion and collective insurance. Neverthe less, it must be kept in mind that both languages originate from the same blind spot of culture: its incompatibility with the law of high numbers?hence its un insurability. Maybe this explains why Kafka, the cross-breed expert of insur ance and of language, one time "goes further" than Nietzsche when it comes to assessing the empirical power of poetry, that is?true readers. In October 1921 Kafka writes in his diary: "A connoisseur, an expert, someone who knows his field, knowledge, to be sure, though that cannot be imparted, but that fortu nately no one seems to stand in need of."68 Unfortunately, the last part of this statement has been disproved?in Kafka's days, and in ours. 68.
