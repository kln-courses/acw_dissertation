<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sculpture, Theater and Art Performance: Notes on the Convergence of the Arts Silvio Gaggi Abstract-The author articulates some tentative distinctions between recent sculpture, art performance and theater proper. A comparison of works in several media suggests a convergence of expansionist sculpture and reductionist theater. He identifies several factors that must be considered in attempting to formulate distinctions between these genre. I. REDUCTION AND EXPANSION Within the twentieth century one can identify both reductionist and expan- sionist currents within the various arts. Reductionists attempt to clarify the essential characteristics of their medium and work within strict limits defined by those characteristics. Expansionists tend to be antipurist, freely creating eclectic works. They are not concerned about 'violating' their medium or borrowing from the other arts. In the visual arts Mondrian and the later hard-edged abstractionists were reductionists. The tradition of collage, extended in the combines of Robert Rauschenberg and culminating in happenings and art performance, represents the expansionist tendency. In theater Jerzy Grotowski expressed a Purist sentiment in his 1964 statement that only one actor and one spectator are required to make a performance [1]. The idea of theater as a synthesis of the arts is present in the work of Brecht (who advocated dissonance among the various representational systems employed as a means of maximizing aesthetic distance) as well as in most contemporary theater, both commercial and noncommercial. Given this situation, it is not surprising that the past quarter-century has witnessed a number of convergences of the arts. In her book Performance, Live Art 1909 to the Present, RoseLee Goldberg surveys the history of art performance, tracing its development through and its significance within the major movements of modern art: Italian and Russian Futurism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, the German Bauhaus, the Bauhaus- inspired activities at Black Mountain Fig. 1.

Until recently, however, the difficulty in documenting performance has resulted in its being neglected as a significant force in the history of art [2]. Technology-as inspiration, as theme and as artistic component-has been closely allied with performance through- out this century. The futurists were obsessed with dynamism and viewed the machine as a means of achieving liberation from the past, a liberation they described in terms that at times bordered on the mystical. Similarly, for the constructivists, the machine was a means of liberation, but one conceived in more strictly materialist terms. Of course the unification of the various arts and the synthesis of art and technology were fundamental Bauhaus principles. The performance-technology link has found expression both through the mechaniza- tion of humans-in machinelike costumes and mechanistic movements and de- clamations by performers-and through the incorporation of technology in performance-film, radio, audio-tape and, in recent years, synthesizers, video tape and live video. If the human is sometimes mechanized, at other times the machine is humanized, as in Jean Tinguely's eminently fallible, perverse and slightly rebellious Homage to New York (1960). George Segal's sculptural tableau Alice Listening to Her Poetry and Music (Fig. 1), though not performance art, is clearly in the expansionist, synthetic tradition. A mannequin of the poet Alice Notely (rendered in Segal's characteristic plaster style) sits at a table. A tape recorder is on the table and behind it is a window. The piece is placed against a wall so that the spectator tends to view the figure from behind and see the face only indirectly, reflected in the window. On the recorder a tape of Notely reading her poetry plays audibly [3]. Because of the image-an individual listening to her own voice on a tape recorder-one is easily reminded of Samuel Beckett's one-act play, Krapp's Last Tape [4]. In Beckett's play the aged Krapp sits at a table listening to a taped diary he made on his thirty-ninth birthday, 30 years earlier. Most of the speech in the play comes from the machine, though Krapp does speak directly at times, usually in response to the voice he hears. He also performs various actions: operating the recorder, eating bananas and going offstage to drink. In spite of the talk and actions, Krapp is a highly reduced form of theater, certainly more reduced that Waiting for Godot, which Tom Stoppard has said "redefined the minima of theatrical validity" [5]. In Godot two characters interact. In Krapp there is only one, although he does interact with his former self, as mediated by a mechanical apparatus. One might argue that no significant action occurs in either play. However, in Godot there is the possibility of choice (to keep waiting, stop waiting or commit suicide), whereas in Krapp there is no suggestion that Krapp has any option other than listening to his tapes and producing the next one. Even Godot, however, tends toward the sculptural. More than any particular action within the play, the image of waiting is most memorable. The memory of Didi, Gogo, the mound and the tree has become imprinted in our con- sciousness and has achieved nearly the status of an archetype. The action of the play is nondevelopmental: the state of affairs in the beginning is in all essentials the same as that at the end, and the points between represent no significant shift. Thus, Godot approaches kinetic sculpture, though it consists in part of human components. It is modern tableau vivant with words. Speech and action occur, but they lead nowhere, and one is left primarily with an image. In his later development Beckett has carried this minimalist tendency even further. In Not I [6] there are only two characters. One, the speaker, is identified as "MOUTH". On the right of the stage only the mouth of this otherwise invisible character is lit. On the left of the stage is a silent auditor who, during MOUTH's monologue, performs a single action three times, raising his or her hands "in a gesture of helpless compassion". With each recurrence this gesture is reduced, so Fig. 2. Samuel Beckett, Rockaby, first performed at the Center for Theatre Research in Buffalo in association with the State University of New York at Buffalo, 1981. Billie Whitelaw performed the woman and the recorded voice. (Photo: Irene Haupt) The movement of the rocker was controlled mechanically and most of the verbal aspect of the production came from a recorded voice. This reductionist theatrical production, like Beckett's earlier Krapp's Last Tape, is reminiscent of expansionist sculptural works like Segal's Alice Listening. Gaggi, Sculpture, Theater and Art Performance 46</page><page sequence="3">that at the third occurrence it is "scarcely perceptible". Apart from these three gestures and the movement of the mouth in speech, there is no physical action on stage. Beckett's Rockaby [7] consists of a single character, an old woman in a rocking chair (Fig. 2). Nearly all speech comes from a voice offstage (a recording of the actress's own voice). Occasionally the woman onstage speaks a single word, "More", once at the outset before the taped voice begins and on three other occasions during pauses on the tape. Also, just prior to these pauses and again at the end of the play, the woman speaks short phrases in unison with the taped voice. The physical action of the play consists simply of the rocking of the chair, which pauses occasionally along with the verbal pauses. The extreme reductionism of Rockaby is even greater than is first apparent. The movements of the rocking chair, which may seem to be controlled by the actress, are actually controlled mechanically. Thus, the actress's performance is further narrowed, limited to her facial expressions and the occasional interjections of words and brief phrases [8]. The mechanized movement underscores the rapprochement between theater and a sculpture that moves. Beckett's A Piece of Monologue [9] lacks even the equivalent of the physical motion of the mechanical rocker of Rockaby. As the title implies, there is a single speaker. His hair is white and he stands onstage in a white nightgown. The only props are a lamp and a pallet bed. The play consists solely of his monologue. Action and events are described in the monologue, but none are performed. Once the monologue begins there are no stage directions whatsoever. The opening curtain announces the beginning of the play and the fade of the lamp indicates its conclusion. These works are highly evocative, in spite of their extreme reductionism. Their power does not result from traditional theatrical sources such as character and conflict, nor from modernist ideas of effective nonverbal performance through gesture and movement; these plays are, in fact, highly verbal and movement is slight or entirely absent. Their power results from a single dominant image juxtaposed with a voice-over or a dramatic mono- logue. The human performer becomes an element in a visually striking sculptural tableau that complements a poetic text. As such, Beckett's reduced theater approaches a form of art that threatens to converge on works of expanded sculpture such as Segal's Alice Listening. The convergence is not complete, Fig. 3. Nam June Paik, TV Cello, performance piece, 1971. (Photo: Tom Harr) Bonino Gallery, NY. Charlotte Moorman played a concert for TV cello and videotape. Although a live performer was involved, the absence of temporal development suggested that the work was put on display when the performer began and taken down when she stopped, rather than that it began and ended at those points. Thus it remains closer to sculpture than theater. however. A Piece of Monologue is theater and Alice Listening is sculpture. It is interesting to note their similarities and to clarify the few but significant elements that keep them separated. The most obvious difference between the two is that Segal's sculptural tableau does not include a live performer. However, the mere substitution of a living woman for Segal's plaster sculpture would not in itself result in theater. Theater requires that the performerperform. As reduced as these plays of Beckett are, there remains an element of live performance, in speech alone if not in physical action, limited though the action may be. A static tableau, even if composed in part of a human being, would not be theater if the entire verbal component were electroni- cally reproduced. II. PERFORMED SCULPTURE The presence of a genuine performer- that is, a performer who in some way performs-is in itself not sufficient to make a piece theater. Nam June Paik's TV Cello (Fig. 3), in which a live performer 'plays' a cello composed of three television monitors, is still more like sculpture than theater [10]. At least as important as the presence of a performer is the temporal dimension required in theater. More specifically, theater does Gaggi, Sculpture, Theater and Art Performance 47</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4. Gilbert and George, Red Sculpture, performance piece, 1976. (Photo: Beyan Davies, Courtesy Sonnabend Gallery, NY) First performed in Tokyo, 1975. For 90 minutes Gilbert and George, with hands and faces painted bright red, went through a series of movements, seemingly triggered by phrases played on a tape recorder. This piece was ambiguous regarding the expectation it placed on the audience. Was it to be viewed from beginning to end, like a theatrical work, or could the audience come and go as it pleased, as with sculpture? not simply involve movement in time but also has temporal limits-beginnings and endings in time. Segal's Alice Listening may be verbally 'kinetic', but there is no indication that the viewer, in order to experience the piece appropriately, should approach it at a particular time and that the piece ends at some later time. The tape of Notely's voice is a component of an expanded collage and an allusion to her identity as a poet. We assume that hearing some part of the tape is sufficient to catch that allusion and apprehend something of the 'flavor' of her art. We do not have to begin experiencing the work at the beginning of the tape and listen to it in its entirety; as with traditional works of visual art we can approach it when we wish and leave when we feel we have seen (and heard) enough. Similarly, in TV Cello there is no expectation that a viewer should begin watching the woman's performance at a certain time and that at some later time the piece is concluded. One has more a sense that the work is put on display when she begins performing and that it is taken down when she stops. A piece like Red Sculpture (Fig. 4), conceived and performed by the British duo Gilbert and George, is also best regarded as sculpture, as its title implies. In 1969 Gilbert and George, London art students, declared themselves to be 'living sculpture' and performed a six-minute piece entitled Underneath the Arches. Humor and irony were a significant part of the work, and in the dedication they declared the work, "The most intelligent fascinating serious and beautiful art piece you have ever seen." They also outlined their 'Laws of Sculptors', a veritable Polykleitan Canon for modern Dadaists who declared their bodies to be works of art. These 'laws' included rules such as "Always be smartly dressed, well groomed relaxed friendly polite and in complete control" and "Make the world to believe in you and to play heavily for this privilege" [11]. The problem with Red Sculpture was Fig. 5. Jean Tinguely, Homage to New York, machine sculpture, 1960. (Photo: David Gahr) The Museum of Modern Art, NY. Because of the anthropomorphic quality of the machine's 'behavior' and because the event unfolded temporally, like a theatrical performance, this work seems more like theater than sculpture, even though no live performer was involved. Gaggi, Sculpture, Theater and Art Performance 48</page><page sequence="5">that it was 90 minutes long, significantly longer than the brief Underneath the Arches. Gilbert and George wore suits and ties and their faces and hands were painted bright red. They walked slowly, mechanically and precisely through various poses, seemingly triggered by phrases played on a tape recorder. The satirical content of the piece was clear, perhaps too obvious. The piece was not without visual interest, as the con- servatively dressed but brightly painted figures moved through their paces, creating, as in dance, a variety of configurations. However, it is unlikely that the satire and visual variations were sufficient to maintain the interest of even the most receptive viewer for an hour and a half. It is here that the distinction between sculpture and theater becomes important. Was Red Sculpture a theatrical work that lasted for 90 minutes or was it a sculptural work that was on display for 90 minutes? The answer is crucial in determining how the audience conceives its responsibility to give the piece a fair viewing. If, like TV Cello, it is a work of sculpture rather than theater, then we are free to come and go as we please, as we would with any other piece of sculpture. Red Sculpture is, in fact, best regarded as a form of performed visual art that maintains close connections with paint- ing and sculpture even though it incorporates live performers into its structure. Robert Wilson began as a painter, but moved into performance. Although his performed works incorporate narrative, much of the sense of narrative is lost because the normal pace of action is radically altered and because of repeti- tion; gesture, movement and composition thus isolate themselves from the narrative context. Partly because Wilson's per- formances are usually carried out in extremely slow motion, his works may be very long. His opera The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin (1973) was a synthesis of earlier pieces and lasted for 12 hours. Richard Schechner describes the per- formance as a 'retrospective' and explains that as the evening wore on individuals spent more and more time-and not just the time of intermissions-in the refresh- ment room socializing, discussing the work, refreshing themselves and pre- paring to reenter the theater [12]. Schechner emphasizes the social function of such a performance, but it is also significant that, treated this way, the work takes on the aspect of a painting or piece of sculpture, where individuals can come and go without indicating dis- respect. III. PERFORMANCES WITHOUT PERFORMERS Thus, it is possible for sculpture to incorporate live performers without quite merging into theater. Ironically, other Fig. 6. Allan Kaprow, 18 Happenings in 6 Parts, happening, 1959. (Photo: Scott Hyde) Reuben Gallery. Happenings had beginnings and endings, but their development was non-narrative and they were often structured in such a way that no individual could experience them in their entirety. Kaprow referred to the apparatus on the right as the 'sandwich man', an anthropomorphic construction consisting of mirrors, a paint can, wooden arms, bicycle wheels and a record player that played a polka. works of sculpture that do not incorporate human performers seem closer to theater than some works that do. Jean Tinguely's Homage to New York [13] was more like a theatrical performance than kinetic sculpture (Fig. 5). Homage was an enormous construction, consisting of literally tons of machinery that included, among other things, a weather balloon, smoke bombs, a piano rigged to play a monotonous three-note motif and go up in flames, scores of bicycle and baby carriage wheels, a child's bassinet, the drum from an old washing machine and two complete meta-matic sections. (Tinguely's 'meta- matics' were works of kinetic sculpture that mechanically produced paintings of abstract expressionist style.) Also in- corporated into Homage was a contribu- tion by Robert Rauschenberg, a 'money thrower' which, when set off by a bit of flash powder, flung out silver dollars. In spite of its mechanical nature, Tinguely's Homage was, like his earlier machines, anthropomorphic. Its anthropomorphic quality did not arise from its appearance, certainly, but from its behavior. Like Tinguely's earlier machines, Homage did not act precisely as it was supposed to act. Among other things, it refused to destroy itself utterly and finally had to be laid to rest by a fireman and two museum guards. Such behavior in his machines delighted Tinguely; it was as if a kind of perverse freedom entered the works and enabled them to do things their own way, regardless of their creator's instructions. Rauschenberg said of Homage, "There were so many different aspects of life involved in the big piece. It was as real, as interesting, as complicated, as vulnerable, and as gay as life itself' [14]. Homage seems more like theater than kinetic sculpture. Invitations were sent to 200 people and indicated that the 'spectacle' would begin at 6:30 on the evening of 17 March. The end of the spectacle would occur, of course, when the machine completed its task of self- destruction or, as things actually turned out, when it was helped toward that end by the fireman and the guards. As in theater (and in contrast to film, which normally proceeds exactly as planned), there was some uncertainty about how well the machine would perform. Thus, because of the temporal limits, because the action was developmental, struggling toward a resolved conclusion, and be- cause of the anthropomorphic elements of unpredictability and fallibility, one is tempted to regard Homage to New York as theater, in spite of the fact that it was performed by a machine. Similarly, Beckett's Breath (1969), a Gaggi, Sculpture, Theater and Art Performance 49</page><page sequence="6">piece that lasts little more than half a minute and includes no live performer, is closer to theater than to kinetic sculpture. Two identical recorded cries frame the 'action' of Breath. An amplified recording of a slow inhalation followed by a slow exhalation is played simultaneously with a gradual increase and decrease of light on a littered stage. Unlike Homage, Breath is exactly scripted; there is nothing indeterminate about it [15]. But, like Homage, it is a performance without a performer. For both works this absence does not, however, result in a sense of dehumanization. Tinguely's machine is anthropomorphic, and Beckett's littered stage is a metamorphic mindscape, a simple and elegant image of the dawning and dimming of consciousness. More- over, both works satisfy certain traditional expectations of the theater. They have beginnings and endings in time and temporal structures that result in a sense of wholeness and completion. Those temporal structures require that the audience witness the works from beginning to end. These examples suggest that temporal structure is crucial in distinguishing theater from sculpture, and is perhaps even more fundamental than the presence of a live performer. There are, however, forms of art performance that do involve temporal structures and temporal limits but which, in some other respect, remain distinguishable from theater proper. Happenings, for example, the major antecedents of the current art per- formance, involve both human performers and temporal boundaries. It is certainly easy enough to distinguish happenings from traditional theater, but it is not so easy to distinguish them from avant- garde theater, where improvisation and audience interaction may occur. IV. THE NONMIMETIC CHARACTER OF PERFORMANCE One significant observation is that in happenings the question of quality of individual performance does not arise. Artists like Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg and Jim Dine, who organized the first happenings, normally used nonprofessional actors: themselves, ether artists or members of the audience. None of the major performance theories from theater, whether along the lines of Stanislavski, Brecht or Grotowski, suffice to provide a gauge for evaluating performances within a happening or art performance. An individual in an art performance is simply his or her self. The artist's performance contrasts with Stanislavskian performance, where the actor attempts to create the illusion of a character, and with Brechtian per- formance, where the actor represents a character even as he or she simultaneously acknowledges his or her own identity as a performer. Art performances are also different from those of Grotowski's ensemble, where the actor performs a ritual baring of the soul by casting off his or her everyday mask [16]. Happenings and art performance involve no such psychological or religious ideational basis and certainly involve no regimen such as that required of Grotowski's performers. Moreover, even though revelation of the self was the goal of Grotowski's theater, that project was carried out within the context of a role the performer assumed [17]. Just as they do not involve characters, happenings and art performance contain no narrative. Kaprow has stated that "happenings are events which, put simply, happen ... Though the best of them have a decided impact... they appear to go nowhere and do not make any particular literary point" [18]. Kaprow's 18 Happenings in 6 Parts (Fig. 6), his first public work of this type, involved six performers and 75 audience participants. Performers went through a strict sequence of movements in three different rooms and members of the audience moved among the three rooms according to individual instructions. The performers' actions were banal, enigmatic or purely formal, but certainly no overall narrative occurred. Even if there had been a narrative, any perception of it would have been destroyed by the programmed movements of the audience and the positioning of their seats, which insured that no individual would ever experience the work in its 'entirety'. Avant-garde theater groups, on the other hand, nearly always maintain at least a minimal narrative in their productions. With rare exceptions, this generalization holds even for the most radical experimentation of the sixties and seventies. The point of departure for most productions-even though character might be dropped and the text not regarded as sacred-generally lay in history, myth or literature. Grotowski's Akropolis (1964) was rooted in a nineteenth-century play by the Polish playwright Stanislaw Wyspianski, reset in the concentration camp at Auschwitz [19]. The Living Theatre's Frankenstein (1965) had its basis in Mary Shelley's novel [20]. The Open Theatre's The Serpent (1968) was rooted in the Bible and in the American assassinations of the sixties [21]. And Peter Brook's and Ted Hughes' Orghast (1971) drew on ancient myths and legends from both the East and the West [22]. Happenings, on the other hand, generally lack any narrative. Performance art, in contrast to theater, abolishes the mimetic dimension. It does not portray character, represent action other than that which is literally present or pretend that the site of the production is another location. Josette Feral writes: Fig. 7. Joan Jonas, video image from Double Lunar Dogs, performance piece, Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley, CA, 1980; Performing Garage, NY, 1981. (Photo: Gwen Thomas, Courtesy Performing Artservices, Inc.) Jonas' art blends various technologies-film, video, electronic music and rock-with movement of the body and narrative elements. Gaggi, Sculpture, Theater and Art Performance --- I 50</page><page sequence="7">"Since it tells of nothing and imitates no one, performance escapes all illusion and representation. With neither past nor future, performance takes place" [23]. Nearly always it is the artist-writer who is the performer. When the German artist Joseph Beuys performed his 1974 piece Coyote: I Like America andAmerica Likes Me-in which he confined himself with a live coyote in a New York gallery for seven days-he was not playing a character but engaging in a ritual that embodied symbolically his relationship with the United States [24]. Even when the performer performs, in the sense of imitates, the character being performed will probably represent an aspect of the artist-performer or an earlier phase of his or her life, as when Eleonor Antin represents characters from her dreams or makes herself up as the male side of her personality. And Joan Jonas' Delay Delay (1972), which involved 13 per- formers in various city lots observed by an audience on top of a five-storey building, suggested an identity between set and setting analogous to the identity between performer and character [25]. Julia Heyward likens the structure of a performance to a conversation. Per- formance resembles "the temporal qualities and eclectic structure of con- versation. As a form it's socially generative, and when the work is good it functions as the sperm or germ. When it's bad there's a quick exit, no talk.... Ultimately conversation is just what's 'seen'. It's a front for that complex thing called life in all its layers and tenses" [26]. Performance can, of course, incorporate or subsume narrative. Frequently it is composed in part largely of anecdotes or autobiographical fragments. But its overall structure is not determined by narrative principles. V. CONCLUSION Traditional theater, then, incorporates live performance of character and action into a temporal structure. Traditional sculpture involves neither live per- formance nor temporal structure. Where one of these two aspects-live per- formance or temporal structure-is present but the other is absent, an ambiguity of genres occurs. Some machine performances seem closer to theater than kinetic sculpture because they have temporal limits and a develop- ment akin to that associated with theater. Some performance art is closer to sculpture than theater because of the lack of a temporal structure. Nearly always, however, there is in performance no imitation of character, action or setting. In its categorical rejection of all mimetic principles, performance art is more radical than the most avant-garde forms of theater. There are exceptions even to these seemingly fundamental generalizations. The Living Theatre'sParadiseNow (1965) had no significant narrative thread, and Jim Dine's happening Car Crash (1960) had a narrative structure-the ritualistic reenactment of an automobile accident in which he had been involved. Joan Jonas' Double Lunar Dogs (Fig. 7), a multi-media performance that incorporated video tape, film, electronic music, rock music and dance, was based on a short story and maintained a narrative thread in spite of its abstraction. Such works are likely to be classified as 'theater' or 'performance' more because of the tradition out of which they arise than on the basis of any inherent properties they possess. On the other hand, the work of individuals such as Robert Wilson and Richard Foreman, creator of the introverted and disturbing Ontological-Hysteric Theatre, will as likely be discussed in writings on contemporary theater as in writings on performance art. In the works of such artists the convergence between art forms is complete. The present situation is such that, instead of various works falling into more or less definable genres, there exists a spectrum of works between theater and sculpture; some are clearly theater, some clearly sculpture and some defy all attempts at classification.
