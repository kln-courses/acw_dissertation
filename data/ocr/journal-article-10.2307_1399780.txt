The Development and Decline of Chinese Cosmology. By John B. Henderson. Neo-Confucian Studies sponsored by The Regional Seminar in Neo-Confucian Studies, Columbia University. New York: Columbia University Press, 1984. Pp. xv + 331. Hardcover $32.50. Alison H. Black Greenock, Scotland Philosophy East &amp; West This book is one of the best ever written on the subject of Chinese thought. To add that it is also the best on Chinese cosmology would scarcely be helpful, given the slenderness of the competition. And per- haps it would not even be true, given the still magnificent presence of Joseph Needham's work in this field, not to mention the slightly more ghostly presence of Marcel Granet's. There are, too, many perceptive and illuminating observations in Angus Graham's and Benjamin Schwartz's briefer excursions into the subject; and the same might be said of the work of others such as Manfred Porkert or Nathan Sivin. But there is no book known to the reviewer that matches Henderson's for its systematic and disciplined historical treatment of the topic, marked by an unusual combination of breadth, detail, originality, and readability. Henderson brings the refreshing outlook of an empirically minded in- tellectual historian to a subject generally seen as arcane and explored in grand generalizations or in bits and pieces according to taste. Taking his stand on the empiricist's last rock, that is, evidence, he treats Chinese cosmology as a historical enterprise pursued for historical reasons. Since his approach is in this sense empirical, and since he also supposes that cosmology is about the cosmos, it will be readily understood that he does not woo the reader with the heady draughts of Durkheimian or Levi-Straussian symbolism (though his awareness of these sorts of inter- pretation lends a mischievous irony to his own writing). Instead he iso- 272</page><page sequence="2">lates what he sees as the most characteristic tendencies of Chinese cosmology and analyzes their development and the criticisms mounted against them, period by period, drawing systematic and illuminating comparison with similar tendencies in Western traditions. His study cul- minates in an exhilarating review of the Ch'ing period-almost an aching void in the study of Chinese cosmology to date. The book's title (was it deliberately provocative?) raises at the outset the question of definition. Every culture in every period has its cosmology (or cosmologies), in a loose sense; how, then, can one speak of the development and decline of Chinese cosmology as though it were not coterminous with the culture itself? The author's justification for speaking thus appears in his Introduction, where he draws attention to the Greek root of "cosmos" as "indicating the existence of a certain harmony and proportion in the world, even a 'consonance between ourselves and the universe."' It is the classical and post-classical expression of this particu- lar concept of cosmic order that Henderson calls Chinese cosmology: clearly articulated in the Chou-Han period, it holds sway until it receives its death-blow in the early Ch'ing period. The heart of this cosmology is identified as correlative thinking-embracing many modes of corre- spondence such as man/cosmos, state/cosmos, wu-hsing, l-ching-based (for example, kua-ch'i, na-chia, and Yang Hsiung's), and Yueh-/ing (cos- mic resonance, and so forth), and cosmographical models such as the well-field, nine provinces, fen-yeh, classical city plan, ming-t'ang, Lo- shu, and Ho-t'u. Other characterizations of Chinese cosmology may come to mind; for example (ranging very roughly from general to speci- fic): holism, organicism, yin-yang, cosmic resonance, yin-yang wu-hsing (confer p. 57), and geometric cosmography (included as subsidiary by Henderson but elevated to greater prominence in John Major's view that the figure of the grid is the key to at least the Warring States and Han cosmological system). Falling around the middle of this range, Hender- son's characterization strikes a happy combination of accuracy and use- fulness-with one qualification, which I will reserve until the end.1 Henderson's study contributes significantly to our understanding of the conditions that govern changes in a world view, including the change from "tradition" to "modernity" (though this is not treated as a specific issue in the book, other than by allusion or implication). The most difficult question of all is of course that of origins. Here, where speculation is of the essence, Henderson is indeed at his most speculative. And it is here that the reviewer is in danger of being lured out of gravitational orbit into the endless reaches of the prehistory of ideas. It is fruitless to say that Henderson either says too much or too little: in this topic, that is the inevitable consequence of saying anything at all. Antecedents he sug- gests for correlative thinking include a tantalizing range; for example, animism, anthropomorphism, analogy, and poetic metaphor. The reader Book Reviews 273</page><page sequence="3">Philosophy East &amp; West may question the conflation of a likeness that is unconsciously assumed (as in anthropomorphism) with a correspondence that is deliberately asserted (as in analogy). But even Henderson's most speculative sugges- tions constitute general observations rather than dogmatic or unprov- able claims about "how the human mind works." Coming to the more immediate origins of correlative thinking, Henderson's rejection of per- ennialist and universalist views is based partly on what he sees (following Goody) as the intrinsic likelihood that full-fledged correspondence sys- tems develop in a literate rather than a primitive culture, and partly on the documentary evidence. He is ready with reasons for the appearance of such systems in the Han. It is to his credit that he does not lean too heavily on Tsou Yen and his "shadowy school"; he speculates that post- classical Confucians and Taoists may have been glad to unload suspect cosmology in their own schools onto Tsou Yen. Other sources that Henderson finds more plausible are Han politics (imperial and other- wise), Han syncretism (fueled by a desire to harmonize the remnants of classical tradition), Chou clan-boosting precedents, aesthetic considera- tions, and an element of (loosely termed) "metaphysical idealism" suffi- cient to create an "epistemological space" for correlative thinking. The last of these contributing factors is illustrated by classical allusions to the heavens as a model for man. Intellectual causes of a reasonably accessible type thus loom large in Henderson's account. This is not the book to go to for extended specula- tion about, for example, Shang origins, the pan-Eurasian Grand Origin Myth, metallurgy as the progenitor of wu-hsing theory, or shamanistic visions and the logic of system-building as a means of magical control. The possible influence of political and social factors is admitted, but (except in the case of overtly political cosmology) not pursued in detail because of a lack of evidence; in any case, Henderson holds that they are less likely to explain origins than outcomes (p. 257). One of the most rewarding features of the book is its meticulous examination of subsequent developments in the pattern of Chinese cos- mology, including the problems and criticisms it faced in successive periods. It is all too easy, for example, to suppose that the magic wand of science is what dispels the mists of traditional cosmology. But Hender- son's study shows that science was dependent on other factors to achieve a strong impact, and it also argues strongly that science was less important than classical studies in effecting radical change. The progress of astronomy, for example, and the discovery of significant anomalies in traditional cosmology did not have serious effect until the Confucian literati themselves became involved in the practice of a science that was not yoked to Confucian "moral metaphysics," at the same time as philo- logical and exegetical studies had advanced to the point where the traditional cosmology was shorn of its supposed classical support. Other 274</page><page sequence="4">contributing factors to the difference between the seventeenth century and its predecessors in relation to traditional cosmology were the sheer overextension of that cosmology and the discovery of real environ- mental change. It is interesting in a Confucian context that moral and pragmatic arguments, although present, do not seem to have been para- mount. Henderson examines the possibility that the political and social changes of the Ming-Ch'ing transition influenced Ch'ing cosmological criticism but finds no clear evidence, leaving the burden of proof to those who would argue otherwise. The seventeenth century offers a fascinating study of something that might have been a Scientific Revolution and wasn't. Faced with the inescapable evidence of anomalies in their tidy cosmological scheme, the Ch'ing Confucians duly revised their cosmology-producing what Henderson calls an "anticosmology," according to which the universe itself is fundamentally anomalous. The positive ardor with which an asymmetrical view of things was embraced is shown in relation to con- current developments in art and philosophy, where the asymmetry of the one seemed to form a natural concomitant of the organicism and vitalism that were fashionable in the other. (Contemporary readers are likely to share the perception of asymmetry as bound up with organic life. And yet it is easy to forget that for men of other times the life of the cosmos was exultantly symmetrical. Stand with C. S. Lewis at the lighted window of the medieval cosmos; or, if a created universe is deemed insufficiently organic, read Ch'eng Hao's panegyric: "Everything has its opposite!..." But no doubt a ch'i-based vitalism such as developed to- wards the end of the Ming was bound to bring asymmetry to the fore.) As to why the downfall (such as it was) of correlative cosmology took such a different course in China from the West, Henderson suggests that the Ch'ing commentators "did their work too well," and adds that "there were evidently no late-traditional Chinese equivalents of Kepler, Newton, Leibniz, or Newlands, transitional figures whose grounding in correlative cosmology helped to prepare the way for the rise of modern science" (pp. 255-256). From a philosophical point of view one is tempted to say that it was no accident that China of this period did not have its Newton, nor was it merely due to the character of Ming-Ch'ing thought that it did not have its Scientific Revolution. The age-old belief in a personal Creator helped to inspire Newton's and other Renaissance scientists' visions of cosmic order; by contrast, the Confucian Wang Fu-chih dismissed the notion of perfect order partly because to his mind it entailed the absurdity of arbitrary creation. The insistence on anomalies in nature dates from at least Chuang Tzu and Hsun Tzu; Chu Hsi and other major Sung thinkers reaffirmed it (as Henderson himself makes clear, pp. 127-128). Although Henderson gives ample recognition to anomalies as a perennial problem Book Reviews 275</page><page sequence="5">for Chinese cosmologists, I wonder if more should not be made of the traditional sanction for Ch'ing "anticosmology." A typical reticence on the subject of cosmology is preserved in the canonical observations that "the doings of high Heaven are without sound or smell" and that "yin and yang are unfathomable": mystery, yes; problem, no. An appeal to the Greek meaning of "cosmos" (already noted) as implying "order," "harmony," "pattern," and so forth, may beg the question of cross- cultural conceptions of harmony. Thus the ordered cosmos depicted by Henderson is easily recognizable as such by Western as well as by Chinese standards. The Ch'ing "anticosmos," on the other hand, is an anticosmos by Greek standards (for example) rather than by Chinese. To put it tersely, the Greeks deplored anomaly; the Chinese glorified it, often seeing in it not a loss but an increase of harmony. That this statement sounds bizarre to Western ears merely illustrates the point. Well might classical studies have done more than astronomy both to precipitate and to limit change in Ch'ing cosmology. I would further suggest that one reason why philosophically minded Confucians tolerated correlative cos- mology as long as they did was because of a lack of interest: might it be that those who hastened its demise were the very ones who were suffi- ciently interested in it to attack it knowledgeably?

New York: Urzone, 1989. Pp. 1610. The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the scholarly interest in the human body, and the three volumes under review here are emblematic of this phenomenon. What is interesting about these three volumes is that they advance an interesting perpective on the understanding of the human body and on the different modes in which the human body is constructed. The emphasis here is not so much on the scientific knowl- edge of the body or the diverse ideologies that conspire to misrepresent the body as on the body as a reality that is continually produced and reproduced in society. The contributors to these volumes, in their diverse ways, are involved in the task of decoding some of these modes of construction. 276</page></plain_text>
