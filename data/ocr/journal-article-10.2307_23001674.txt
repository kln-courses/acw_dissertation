<plain_text><page sequence="1">Darshan of the Image Diana L. Eck The image which Hindus come to"see"in a temple or an open-air shrine may be anthropomorphic in appearance, albeit with fantastic features which may little resemble any anthropos of flesh and blood, or it may be theriomorphic, like Hanuman with the body of a monkey or Ganesha with the head of an elephant. On the other hand, it may have no discernible "form" at all; it may be a rock outcropping or a smooth stone. In exploring the nature ofimages in the Hindu context we must make a further distinction between the iconic and the aniconic image. For our purposes, the iconic image is one which is representational; it has a recognisable "likeness" to its mythic sub ject. The Latin icon or the Greek eikon means "likeness" or "image" and calls to mind the icons of Orthodox Christianity which show a likeness of Christ or Mary. By contrast, the aniconic images are those symbolic forms which, although they refer to a deity, do not attempt any an thropomorphic form or any representational likeness. The plain cross, for example, is aniconic, as is the linga of Shiva or the natural stone salagrama of Vishnu. India has ancient traditions of both iconic and aniconic image-mak ing. The terracotta female "deities" of the Indus Valley, for example, are certainly full-bodied representations of the female form, although it is not clear how they were utilised ritually. On the other hand, the Vedic ritual tradition of the Aryan newcomers has generally been seen as aniconic, for there is no evidence ofimages or of permanent temples *Krpi inted, with permission, from Diana L. Eck, Darshan: Seeing the Divine Image in India, Anima Hooks, Pennsylvania, 1985. 43</page><page sequence="2">Diana L. Eck or sanctuaries. Vedic religion consisted primarily of domestic and kingly sacrificial rites centred around the sacred fire. The fire was both a focus and a vehicle of ritual activity. The construction of the Vedic fire altar was the symbolic construction of the "image" of the primordial creator, Prajapati, and therefore was also the symbolic construction of the world, which emerged from Prajapati. The fire has continued to be utilised as an aniconic image of the divine, and it has a central place in many Hindu rites. Although in the Vedic period there is virtually no evidence to indicate the use of iconic images in worship,1 it is important to note that the Vedic poets were image-makers in another sense: they created vivid images of the gods in their poetry. There was the Sun, the witness of the world with heavenly eye; Agni, with seven red tongues, seven faces and gleaming hair; and Indra, the warrior, who carried the thunderbolt. The Aniconic Image While the fire might be considered an ancient aniconic "image", I want to turn here to the traditions of aniconic imaging that have emerged from the folk traditions of India and continue to have influence all over India today. The most ancient non-Vedic cultus of India was almost certainly aniconic. Stones, natural symbols, and earthen mounds sig nified the presence of a deity long before the iconic images of the great gods came to occupy the sancta of temples and shrines. Much of India, especially rural India, still designates its local deities in this way, be they devis, bhairavas,yakshas, or others. The villager whom the urban ar tist "discovered" sanctifying a stone with red kumkum powder is at home in this tradition. Many of the deities of this ancient cultus were and are local deities, such as the grama devatas, "village deities," or task-specific deities, such as Sitala who has to do with fever-diseases,or the matrikas (mothers) who have to do with birth and childhood. Within their areas ofjurisdic tion they both cause and cure disease, bring both safety and harm. There are also deities of what Coomaraswamy has called the "life-cult", namely, tht yakshas and nagas, associated respectively with trees and pools.2 They too are propitiated as both beneficent and potentially fierce. In their beneficent form they are associated with well-being, and the plump, hospitable Ganesha is one heir of this ancient family of deities. 1 J.N.

There is some controversy about the existence ofimages in Vedic times, centring around a verse "Who will buy this my Indra for ten cows?" Rig Veda IV.24.10. Banerjea discusses the matter here. ~ Ananda Coomaraswamy, Yakshas, 2 vols., (1928-31, reprinted in one volume, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1971), especially Part II, "Water Cosmology," pp. 13-17. 44</page><page sequence="3">Darshan of the Image Shiva-Linga Kedar Ghat, Varanasi The form of worship offered to these deities included sprinkling the stone with water, making offerings of flowers, food, cloth and incense, and smearing the stone with various substances. These are essentially the types of rites which become the constituent elements of Hindu puja in the later tradition. Frequently, however, the ancient rites also in cluded meat and liquor as part of the food offering, and blood as part of the smearing or anointing of the stone. This type of worship, called bali, is still ofTered to certain autochthonous deities. Those who accept sacri ficial offerings may sometimes be offered blood, but more frequently the anointing today is with vermilion paint or dry red kumkum powder. In addition to the many local deities whose presence is marked by vermilion smeared stones, there are a number of aniconic images which have attained a prominent place in wider pan-Indian ritual. The salag rama stone, for instance, is called a svarupa, a "natural form" of Vishnu. This smooth stone, found primarily in the bed of the Gandaki River in Nepal, is inherently sacred, so it needs no consecration rites when it is installed for worship in a temple or home shrine. For the Hindu, it is Vishnu. Similarly, the stones of Mount Govardhan in Vraj, the north Indian homeland of Krishna, are known as svarupa forms of Krishna, and they are taken from Govardhan to be worshipped in homes and</page><page sequence="4">Diana L. Eck temples all over Vraj and, indeed, all over India.3 In the sacred River Narmada, which runs to the west across central India, there is another special stone - the bana linga which is said to be a natural form ofShiva. This smooth, cylindrical stone may be worship ped as Shiva without any rite of consecration. The bana linga is consi dered a svayambhu, "self-born," linga. The linga is perhaps the best known of India's aniconic images. Not all lingas, of course, are bana lingas. Most are fashioned by artisans and established in Shiva temples by rites of consecration. It is primarily in this form that Shiva is worshipped in the temples of India. The linga is often referred to as a "phallic" symbol, and for those European travellers and missionaries who saw it as an unmistakable "likeness" of the phallus, rather than an aniconic image ofShiva, the linga evoked the strongest feelings of moral outrage. For example, the Abbe Dubois, an eighteenth century French missionary, described it as "obscene," and wrote, "It is incredible, it is impossible to believe, that in inventing this vile superstition the religious teachers of India in tended that the people should render direct worship to objects the very names of which, among civilised nations, are an insult to decency".4 It. is true that some of the myths of the linga's origin are myths of castra tion, and it is true that the earliest linga image (the Gudimallam linga, ca. 100 B.C.E.) is clearly phallic in form.5 However, the linga as it is worshipped in India today is more accurately seen as an aniconic image, and the myths of the Shaivas for whom this symbol is significant, see its origins in a magnificent hierophany of a fiery column of light, rather than in a primal act of castration.6 Those who worship Shiva in the linga form are consistently appalled to hear it understood as phallic, and again we suspect the interpretations of the "eye of the beholder." The linga consists of two parts: the vertical stone shaft, which may be seen as the male component, Shiva, and the circular horizontal base, called a yoni or pitha, which is the female component, Shakti. The wedge-shaped spout is also part of thejvoni and serves as a drain to carry away the water offerings poured upon the linga. Together the linga and pitha form the Shiva-Shakti symbol of divine unity. The one who is com monly called "Shiva" is seen in the linga as both Shiva and Shakti, male and female, divine spirit and divine matter, transcendent and imma 3 Charlotte Vaudeville, "Braj, Lost and Found," lndo-Iranian Journal 18 (1976), p. 199.

In addition, the shaft of the linga is often said to have three sections, representing Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva respec tively. The word linga means "mark" or "sign" as well as "phallus," and it is in the former sense, as the sign of Shiva, Mahadeva, the "Great Lord," that the linga is honoured in the sancta of the many temples and shrines of India. There are many other types of aniconic images which present the Hindu worshipper with the deity's token or sign, rather than the deity's face. Of course, the various gods have many emblems by which they can be recognised, including weapons, such as Rama's bow, and ani Chatur Mukha Shiva-Linga Gupta, 5th century AD.

Here, however, we are concerned with those emblems that are honoured as the very embodiment of the god. Among these there is the full pot of water, indicating the presence of the devi;1 the lotiform sun disc, marking the place of the Sun, Surya; the footprints (padukas), showing the presence of Vishnu or a saint or, in former days, the Buddha; and the yantra, the geometric interlocking triangles signifying the devi. Finally, among aniconic images are those embodiments of divinity which are aspects of nature, such as the River Ganga or the River Yamuna; the tulsi (basil) plant; the ashvattha (fig) tree; and the Sun. . The Iconic Image Just as the term icon conveys the sense of a "likeness", so do the Sanskrit words pratikriti and pratima suggest the "likeness" of the image to the deity it presents. The common word for such images, however, is murti, which is defined in Sanskrit as "anything which has definite shape and limits," "a form, body, figure," "an embodiment, incarna tion, manifestation."8 Thus the murti is more than a likeness; it is the deity itself taken ^form". The uses of the word murti in the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita suggest that the form is its essence. The flame is the murti of fire (Shvetashvatra Upanishad 1.13), or the year is the murti of time (Maitri Up anishad 6.14). When the formless waters of creation were brooded upon by the creator, form (murti) emerged (Aitareya Upanishad 3.2). It is form (murti) which takes shape in the womb of the unfathomable Brahman who gives birth to all forms (Bhagavad Gita 14.3-4). While the word murti does not commonly mean the icon of a deity in this early period, it is significant that the term itself suggests the congealing of form and limit from that larger reality which has no form or limit. However, the murti is a body-taking, a manifestation, and is not different from the re ality itself. Another common word for the iconic image is vigraha, a word which means "body." As a noun, vigraha comes from a verbal root (vi+grah) which means "to grasp, to catch hold of." The vigraha is that form which enables the mind to grasp the nature of God. The images of the gods are not "likenesses" of any earthly form. They are fantastic forms, with multiple heads and arms, with blue, green,or vermilion colouring, or with part-animal bodies. They are not intended to "represent" earthly realities, but rather to present divine realities. 7 Charlotte Vaudeville, conversation, April 1980. Since the trident is also one of Shiva's charac teristic weapons, many associate it primarily with him. According to Vaudeville, the trident, on the contrary, is almost invariably an indication of the devi. 8 V.S. Apte, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 3 vols.

To the extent that the vigraha is a "body", it is anthropomorphic. But the body with Shiva's three eyes, or Vishnu's four arms, or Skanda's six heads is hardly like our own. The things of the world we can see well enough all about us, but for the In dian religious artist the task of image-making was giving shape to those things we cannot readily see.</page><page sequence="8">Diana L. Eck The iconic image has had a central role in Hindu worship for about two thousand years. Leaving aside the images of the Indus Valley, the first anthropomorphic images were those of the stoutjyakshas and volup tuous yakshis, whose worship constituted the prevailing popular cultus of India.9 It is not surprising that the images of such "life-cult" deities - who were and who remain most intimately involved in the vital con cerns of birth and growth, sickness and death —should be among the first fashioned in stone by craftsmen, beginning in the Mauryan period in the third ccntury B.C.E.10 In the first century C.E., the Buddha-previously represented by aniconic symbols such as his footprints—came to be depicted in an an thropomorphic image. This happened both in the Hellenistic school of art which developed in northwest India at the Asian crossroads called Gandhara and in the religious centre of Mathura in central north India. In Gandhara, the Buddha's form was Greco-Roman in style. In Mathura, however, the early Buddhas seem to inherit their style and bearing from the sturdyjyaA:^a^ of the Mauryan age. While there are a few early images of Hindu gods, such as the second century B.C.E. reliefs of Indra and Surya at Bhaja on the western ghats south of Bombay, they were not established as cult icons. Rather, the Bhaja reliefs were part of a Buddhist monastic retreat. The real flower ing of the Hindu divine image took place in the Gupta period (4th-7th centuries), called the Golden Age of Indian Art. During this time some of the earliest Hindu stone temples were constructed: the Durga temple at Aihole near Badami and the Vishnu temple at Deograh, with its fam ous image of Vishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha." The development of images used in worship occurred at the same time as the development of the temples which house the images. After the Gupta period, the impetus for such artistic and religious creativity came primarily from the regional dynasties of India. In Orissa in the east, there was an era of temple construction in Bhuvaneshwar (8th 11th centuries); nearby at Konarak the famous temple of the Sun was built (13th century). The temples of Khajuraho were patronised by the Candella kings of central India (11th century). In the west, the rock-cut temple at Ellura was created during the Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th-9th centuries). In the south, the seaside temples of Mahabalipuram were built under the patronage of the Pallavas (7th 9 See the work of Ananda Coomaraswamy. Yakshas; V.S. Agrawal,.Ana'tnl Indian Folk Cults (Var anasi: Prithivi Prakashan, 1970); and F.D.K. Bosch, The Golden Germ (Gravenhage: Mouton &amp; Co. 1960). 10 From the Mauryan period there is thzyaksha from Parkham (Mathura Museum), thtyaksha from Patna (Calcutta, Indian Museum), and th e yaks hi from Besnagar (Calcutta, Indian Museum). For plates of the first two, see Benjamin Rowland, The Art and Architecture of India (1953, 3rd revised edition, Baltimore, Md.: Penguin Book, 1967), plates 24 &amp; 25. 11 Rowland, pp. 221-27. 50</page><page sequence="9">Darshan of the I may 9th centuries); Tanjore was built by the Cholas (11th century); Vij ayanagar was built by refugees from the north during the Muslim inva sions (16th century); and Madurai was built by the Nayak dynasty (17th century). All these sanctuaries provided the stimulus for a wide variety of sculptural works, not only the prolific imagery of the temple exteriors, but the icons which occupied the inner sancta and the side shrines as well.12 The traditions of sculptural representation of the gods, as they emerged during these centuries, served both theological and narrative functions. First, Hindu images were visual "theologies," and they con tinue to be "read" as such by Hindus today. For example, the icon of the four-armed Shiva dancing in a ring of fire reveals the many aspects of this god in one visual symbol.13 The flaming circle in which he dances is the circle of creation and destruction called samsara (the earthly round of birth and death) or maya (the illusory world). The Lord who dances in the circle of this changing world holds in two of his hands the drum of creation and the fire of destruction. He displays his strength by crush ing the bewildered demon underfoot. Simultaneously, he shows his mercy by raising his palm to the worshipper in the "fear-not" gesture and, with another hand, by pointing to his upraised foot, where the worshipper may take refuge. It is a wild dance, for the coils of his asce tic's hair are flying in both directions, and yet the facial countenance of the Lord is utterly peaceful and his limbs in complete balance. Around one arm twines the naga, the ancient serpent which he has incorporated into his sphere of power and wears now as an ornament. In his hair sits the mermaid River Ganga, who landed first on Shiva's hair when she fell from heaven to earth. Such an image as the dancing Shiva engages the eye and extends one's vision of the nature of this god, using simple, subtle, and commonly understood gestures and emblems. In any image, it is the combination and juxtaposition of these gestures and emblems which expresses the ambiguities, the tensions, and the paradoxes which Hindus have seen in the deity: Shiva holds both the drum and the flame; the Goddess Kali simultaneously wears a gory gar land of skulls and gestures her protection; Vishnu appears with Shiva's emblems in his own hands. This image-world of India is what Betty Heimann has aptly called "visible thought."14 Images are not only visual theologies, they are also visual scriptures. The many myths of the tradition are narrated in living stone. In the west, the great carved portals of the Chartres Cathedral, for example, presented the stories, the ethics, and the eschatology of the Christian 12 See Rowland, Chapter 17, "The Period of the Hindu Dynasties." 13 See Ananda Coomaraswamy's classic essay on " The Dance of Shiva" in The Dance of Shiva: Fourteen Indian Essays (1918, reprint New York: Farrar Straus &amp; Co., 1957). 14 Heimann, Chapter II, "Visible Though." 51</page><page sequence="10">Diana L.

Even earlier, Pope Gregory I had recognised the didactic value ofimages: "For that which a written document is to those who can read, that a picture is to the un lettered who look at it. Even the unlearned see in that what course they ought to follow; even those who do not know the alphabet can read there."15 In India, some of the earliest sculptural reliefs, on the railing around the Buddhist stupa at Bharhut, were medallions which told the |J Cited in Albert C.

Similarly, the great temples of Hindu India often displayed bas relief portrayals of myths and legends. In the late Gupta image depicted here, the story of the descent of the River Ganga is told: Shiva stands, flanked by his wife Parvati and the ascetic Bhagiratha, who performed austerities for thousands of years in order to bring the Ganga to earth. Bhagiratha, all skin and bones, is shown in an ascetic posture, holding his arms up in the air, while the Triple pathed Ganga—flowing in heaven, on the earth, and in the nether worlds — hovers over Shiva's head in the form of three mermaids. In India today, this narrative and didactic tradition is carried on in folk art. One will see the episodes of myth painted on the walls of public buildings, private homes, and temples. Hanuman carries the mountain full of healing herbs to revive the armies of Rama in Lanka, or Vishnu emerges from a turtle in one of his many world-rescuing avataras. Local and regional legends are elaborated as well, such as those of the God dess Minakshi and Shiva Sundareshvara painted in the temple com pound a.t Madurai. Modern technology has been eagerly employed for the presentation of traditional myths. In Indian commercial films, for example, one will see Shiva, standing in his animal hides in the high Himalayas, with ani mated artificial snakes swaying to and fro about his neck,16 or one may see a cartoon rendering of the primordial contest of the gods, and the demons when they churned the Sea of Milk.17 In several of India's newest temple complexes, such as Tulsi Manas temple in Varanasi, there are Disneyland-type plastic figures of the gods, with moving parts and voices. For example, at the door of Tulsi Manas temple stands Hanuman, the monkey servant of Lord Rama, tearing open his chest every few seconds to reveal the Lord within his heart and uttering the words "Ram Ram!" Such images attract villagers from many miles away. These people watch the animated scenes with fascination and de votion, and they linger to tell one another the stories and to remind one another of the details. Finally, the mass printing of colour reproduc tions has extended the availability of images. Hindus are great consum ers of these polychrome glossy images of the gods and their deeds. Tak ing them home from a temple or a place of pilgrimage, the devout may place such images in the home shrine. Thus one may have darshan not only of the image, but of the picture of the image as well! 16 I think especially here of the older Hindi film Sampurna Tirthayatra, the tale of a woman who gets her husband back by undertaking a circumambulatory pilgrimage of India. Shiva is portrayed quite dramatically as he engineers it all from his Himalayan abode. 17 The Hindi film of the Vishnu Purana included this scene of the churning of the Sea of Milk. 53</page></plain_text>
