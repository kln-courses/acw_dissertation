<plain_text><page sequence="1">USING GS EXTENSIONAL DEVICES TO EXPLORE CARL SANDBURG'S POETRY David F. Maas* Although Sandburg he (1878-1967) began writing seems before to have the been birth guided of general by ideas semantics, closely Carl re- Sandburg (1878-1967) seems to have been guided by ideas closely re- lated to general semantics formulations, especially those of non-identity, non- allness, self-reflexiveness, and the use of the extensional devices. Joseph De Vito, in his introduction to the tutorial cassette program, Gen- eral Semantics: Guide and Workbook (1), identified what he characterized as three deceptively simple principles of General Semantics: 1 . The principle of non-identity - no two things in the universe are identical, and no one thing is the same at two different times. 2. The principle of non-allness - we can never know all about any- thing. 3. The principle of self-reflexiveness - the observer is a part of what he observes. * Dr. David Maas, Education Editor of ETC , is a Professor of English at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, and the author of many ETC articles. 411</page><page sequence="2">412 ETC • October 2005 To help us internalize these principles, Korzybski has given us extensional devices to make our verbal maps more accurately fit the territory they repre- sent: 1 . The index subscript - reminding us that no two things are ever the same even though they may have the same word or label, e.g., car1? car2. 2. The date subscript - reminding us that nothing remains the same over time, e.g., car1916, car2005. 3. The etc., - emphasizing that we can never say all about anything. By incorporating these devices into our evaluations, we approach our life situations more sanely, fostering a healthy extensional orientation - defined by Susan and Bruce Kodish in Drive Yourself Sane as "an attitude towards living which involves orienting ourselves primarily to non-verbal happenings and 'facts,' with the ability to use intensional approaches when appropriate." (2, p. 169) Many of Carl Sandburg's reflective poems provide concrete visual details that vividly illustrate the general semantics extensional devices. Conversely, the general semantics extensional devices provide insights into Sandburg's po- etry. Getting extensional seemed a perennial theme for this populist activist poet. His poem "Happiness" (3) illustrates the erroneousness of separating reified high order abstractions from the numerous concrete point events from which they were abstracted. The last two lines of the poem suggest that the narrator has switched from a stressful, purely intensional orientation to a more tranquil, extensional one: I asked the professors who teach the meaning of life to tell me what is happiness. And I went to famous executives who boss the work of thousands of men. They all shook their heads and gave me a smile as though I was trying to fool with them And then one Sunday afternoon I wandered out along the Desplaines river And I saw a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with their women and children and a keg of beer and an accordion.</page><page sequence="3">Using GS Extensional Devices to Explore Carl Sandburg's Poetry 413 Dr. Sanford I. Berman in his cassette presentation on The Semantics of Happiness (4) has pointed out the futility of defining happiness (or any other reified high order abstraction) apart from the event level that has unique sig- nificance to every human being: "Happiness" is a high order abstraction, and each person has his own definition. Some people are happy by living a life of leisure, or a hobo's existence, while others are happy if they make more and more money. Some people are happy by living the life of a scholar - reading, doing research, learning, gaining knowledge - while others are happy going out every night to parties, social affairs, nightclubs and country clubs. Whether or not these people are really "happy," whatever that means, is another question, which can, perhaps, be best determined by a psychiatrist. In a lesson on high order abstractions, Berman points out the ambiguity that accrues from using terms that have many simultaneous meanings, or using terms that mean different things on different levels of abstraction or specificity: Now, one of the dangers of high order abstractions is that they are often ambiguous. The more ambiguous a statement, the more it can mean all things to all people. The five hundred most commonly used words in the English language have over 14,000 dictionary definitions or meanings. You can well imagine how many different meanings other high order abstractions not so commonly used might have in the course of a conversation or discussion. Take a look at a large dictionary, and you will find as many as 40 or 50 dictionary definitions given for any particular word. To each of those dictionary definitions we could assign a separate index number. Sandburg's rather cynical inductive reflections on the reification of the term government or government in action in his poem "Government" (5) could also be assigned index subscripts: Government - I heard about the Government and I went out to find it. I said I would look closely at it when I saw it. Then I saw a policeman dragging a drunken man to the callaboose. It was the Government in action. (Government^</page><page sequence="4">414 ETC • October 2005 I saw a ward alderman slip into an office one morning and talk with a judge. Later in the day the judge dismissed a case against a pickpocket who was a live ward worker for the alderman. Again I saw this was the Government, doing things. (Government^ I saw militiamen level their rifles at a crowd of workingmen who were trying to get other workingmen to stay away from a shop where there was a strike on. Government in action. (Government^ Everywhere I saw that Government is a thing made of men, that Government has blood and bones, it is many mouths whispering into many ears, sending telegrams, aiming rifles, writing orders, saying "yes" and "no." Government dies as the men who form it die and are laid away in their graves and the new Government that comes after is human, made of heartbeats of blood, ambitions, lusts, and money running through it all, money paid and money taken, and money covered up and spoken of with hushed voices. A Government is just as secret and mysterious and sensitive as any human sinner carrying a load of germs, traditions and corpuscles handed down from fathers and mothers away back. The last three stanzas of this poem seem to be open-ended reflections of a reified anthropomorphized personification; this calls for the etc., extensional device. Another of Sandburg's poems, "Who am I?" (6) emphasizes the non-all- ness principle in riddle format, illustrating the impossibility of getting the com- plete and total truth about anything. The kaleidoscopic descriptions moving effortlessly from place to place provide the illusion of vast expanses of space without the hint of reaching closure (italics mine):</page><page sequence="5">Using GS Extensional Devices to Explore Carl Sandburg's Poetry 415 My head knocks against the stars. My feet are on the hilltops. My finger-tips are in the valleys and shores of universal life. Down in the sounding foam of primal things I reach my hands and play with pebbles of destiny. I have been to hell and back many times. I know all about heaven, for I have talked with God. I dabble in the blood and guts of the terrible. I know the passionate seizure of beauty And the marvelous rebellion of man at all signs reading "Keep Off." My name is Truth and I am the most elusive captive in the universe. We observe one of the most poignant examples of the danger of the vast disconnect between the symbol (or verbal map) and the grim reality of what the symbol actually represents in Sandburg's poem "Buttons" (7) (italics mine): I have been watching the war map slammed up for advertising in front of the newspaper office. Buttons - red and yellow buttons - blue and black buttons - are shoved back and forth across the map. A laughing young man, sunny with freckles, Climbs a ladder, yells a joke to somebody in the crowd, And then fixes a yellow button one inch west And follows the yellow button with a black button one inch west. (Ten thousand men and boys twist on their bodies in a red soak along a river edge, Gasping of wounds, calling for water, some rattling death in their throats.) Who would guess what it cost to move two buttons one inch on the war map here in front of the newspaper office where the freckle-faced young man is laughing to us?</page><page sequence="6">416 ETC • October 2005 The stark contrast between the laughing young man effortlessly moving the buttons on the map and the extensional reality of the blood-soaked soldiers gasping and dying of their wounds dramatizes the serious disconnect between the verbal symbol and the reality it represents. Sandburg, in many of his poems, illustrates the principle of constant change - that no one thing is the same at two different times - calling for the dating subscript extensional device. When frozen in time, a landscape appears static, but as time unfolds, one becomes aware of tearing down and building up fol- lowed by tearing down and building up. Sandburg illustrates this non-identity continuous-change principle in his poem "And They Obey" (8) (italics mine): Smash down the cities. Knock the walls to pieces. Break the factories and cathedrals, warehouses and homes Into loose piles of stone and lumber and black burnt wood: You are the soldiers and we command you. Build up the cities. Set up the walls again. Put together once more the factories and cathedrals, warehouses and homes Into buildings for life and labor: You are workmen and citizens all: We command you. This continual kaleidoscopic panorama of change - involving tearing down and building up reminds me of Richard P. Marsh's observation in his article "Limiting Structures of Language and Culture" that, "in Nootka, 'house' is not so much a noun as it is a verb." (9, p. 111). In his poem "Languages" (10), Sandburg expresses the awareness that lan- guage is an activity continuously in flux, having both a time-binding and space- binding dimension, expressed in imagery of rivers, effluvia, and continual move- ment through time (italics mine): There are no handles upon a language Whereby men take hold of it And mark it with signs for its remembrance. It is a river , this language,</page><page sequence="7">Using GS Extensional Devices to Explore Carl Sandburg's Poetry 417 Once in a thousand years Breaking a new course Changing its way to the ocean. It is mountain effluvia Moving to valleys And from nation to nation Crossing borders and mixing. Languages die like rivers. Words wrapped round your tongue today And broken to shape of thought Between your teeth and lips speaking Now and today Shall be faded hieroglyphics Ten thousand years from now. Sing - and singing - remember Your song dies and changes And is not here to-morrow Any more than the wind Blowing ten thousand years ago. Sandburg occasionally brings into convergence all three general semantics principles, non-identity ; non-allness, and self-reflexiveness. We can apply the index, the date , and the etc., to Sandburg's poem "Skyscraper" (11), which uses self-reflexive personification to comment on a multitude of activities and inter- actions taking place day and night over a period of time. The repeated phrase hour by hour calls attention to the passage of time. The references to having a soul reflects consciousness, and the catalogs of vivid but incomplete descrip- tions of activities (i.e., "Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar," . . men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes") and of things ("Pails clang . . . Scrubbers work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit") create a dynamic moving image of a self- reflective (aware of its context in a larger system) process. The frenetic cata- loging of detail resembles the omnivorous lines of Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself." The excerpts below reflect the passage of time (calling for the date), the plethora of detail that nevertheless calls for the etc., and the self-awareness reflected by its context and awareness of place, as well as the self-reflective anthropomorphism. (In my added emphasis, bold-italic type indicates ideas associated with the date extensional device, and the italic type indicates ideas that would call for the etc., extensional device.)</page><page sequence="8">418 ETC • October 2005 Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the earth and hold the building to a turning planet. Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and hold together the stone walls and floors. Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an architect voted. Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust , and the press of time running into centuries , play on the building inside and out and use it. Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid in graves where the wind whistles a wild song without words And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor. Souls of them all are here , even the hod carrier begging at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick- layer who went to state's prison for shooting another man while drunk. {One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the end of a straight plunge - he is here his soul has gone into the stones of the building .) One by one the floors are emptied . . . The uniformed elevator men are gone. Pails clang... Scrubbers work , talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit, and machine grime of the day. A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of crosses and clusters over the sleeping city. By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars and has a soul.</page><page sequence="9">Using GS Extensional Devices to Explore Carl Sandburg's Poetry 419 In much of his poetry, Carl Sandburg seems to have instinctively expressed the general semantic formulations of non-identity , non-allness , and self-reflex- iveness , and to have anticipated the extensional devices - the index subscript, the date subscript , and use of the etc. Using these general semantics formula- tions to explore Sandburg's poetry gives us a greater appreciation for both the general semantics principles and their extensional devices and the poetry of Carl Sandburg.
