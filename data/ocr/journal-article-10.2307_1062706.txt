Brenneman, Jr. SERPENTS, COWS, AND LADIES: CONTRASTING SYMBOLISM IN IRISH AND INDO-EUROPEAN CATTLE-RAIDING MYTHS RECENT RESEARCH Recent scholarship in the history of religions has once again returned to a study of the Indo-European cattle-raiding myth. This interest retains earlier hermeneutic roots in the work of Georges Dumezil and his stress on the three functions within Indo-European society- sovereign, warrior, and farmer-and reflects concern for the detri- mental treatment of women among the Indo-Europeans. Bruce Lincoln, writing in 1976, suggests, primarily by means of a philological interpretation, that the cattle-raiding myth provides a paradigm for the social class of the warrior. He builds, in this article, upon Dumezil and his own earlier work in which he presents a paradigmatic myth for the sovereign class.1 What is of particular concern to us is his inclusion into the Indo-European category of Celtic cattle-raiding myths, specifically the Tain Bo Cuailnge. Another more recent and very interesting piece on the cattle-raiding myth and its relationship to bride-stealing myths was published in I Bruce Lincoln, "The Indo-European Myth of Creation," History of Religions 15, no. 2 (November 1975): 121-45. Here Lincoln distinguishes between sovereigns and warriors, despite his own admittance that Dumezil hesitates on this distinction, some- times identifying kings and warriors. ?1989 by The University of Chicago.

Thus Arabagian is suggesting a hermeneutical tool in which it is assumed that cultural technologies are responses to the ecological situation of a people.5 Attending these technologies will be particular symbols and values, and these symbols and values will be essentially similar wherever the particular technology is found. Using such a tool, it is possible to compare fruitfully cultures with common technologies separated by both time and space. By compar- ing a number of cultures having the same environment and technology one can establish religious structures and symbol systems that, al- though essentially common among the cultures involved, evidence variations that when compared enhance our understanding of the nature of the religious type under study. Results of such studies have clarified not only that differing en- vironments and their technological responses produce radically differ- ing religious intentionalities but that the same symbol used in different cultural strata will engender quite different symbolic meanings. For example, the symbolism of the serpent in pastoral nomadic cultures will be generally interpreted as negative and life destroying, while in subsistence-level cereal grain cultures it will have a generally positive and life-giving quality.6 I propose in this study to make use of this tool of cultural stratification; however, I will place greater stress upon the symbols involved within the ecological contexts rather than lin- guistic continuity among the peoples under study. 2 Ruth Katz Arabagian, "Cattle Raiding and Bride Stealing," Religion 14 (1984): 107-42. 3 Ibid., p. 107. 4 Ibid., pp. 125, 126. 5 This same methodological tool is cited by Bruce Lincoln in his Priests, Warriors and Cattle (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981), pp. 9-10. However he makes almost no use of it, and his interpretation relies primarily upon etymological research. According to Lincoln, Ake Hultkrantz is responsible for this "daring new means of attack on the problem of comparing ieligions rooted in similar cultures" (Lincoln, p. 9). It should be noted, however, that Mircea Eliade makes implicit use of the same principle in his Cosmos and History (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1954), and Patterns in Comparative Religion (Cleveland: Meridian, 1958). In these works he sets forth two religious patterns, one termed "historical" religions, based upon various forms of animal cultures-e.g., pastoral nomadic and hunters-and the other termed "cosmic" religions, based upon forms of plant cultures-e.g., root crop and cereal grain cultivators. It is in the spirit of Eliade's work with its emphasis upon symbolism that I shall make use of this interpretive tool. 6 See Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, pp. 167-69, for serpent symbolism and its relationship to growth, women, and the moon. 341</page><page sequence="3">Serpents, Cows, and Ladies Although both Lincoln and Arabagian make some use of the ecological tool, their concerns are different. Whereas Lincoln seeks to identify a warrior paradigm myth, Arabagian wishes to understand the cultural roots of masculine domination over women among the Indo-Europeans. Like Lincoln, however, she includes the Celts within the Indo-European grouping despite their differing ecological, techno- logical, and mythological context. Arabagian even notices that there is a positive attitude toward the goddess and women among the Irish Celts which is at opposite poles to the Indo-Europeans,7 but she fails to connect this with their earth-centered technology and their mytho- logical focus upon the goddess. Despite this failure to accept the implications of her own research, Arabagian arrives at some extremely important interpretive conclu- sions involving the symbolism of the components of the cattle-raid myth (e.g., serpents, cows, water, fathers, etc.) as well as the symbolic connection between the enactment of the myth and the attainment of sovereignty in Ireland. INTERPRETIVE REVISIONS There is one major change of interpretation on the cattle-raid myth I will propose here, amplifying much of what has been done on this myth thus far but bringing to bear some further symbolic implications that I feel have been overlooked. My suggestion is that it is a mistake to identify, in terms of worldview and religious symbolism, the Indo- Europeans and the Celts, particularly the Goidel Celts.8 Despite the common linguistic roots within the Indo-European language group, the cultural heritage of the Celts from their earliest beginnings differs from that of the Indo-Europeans who invaded India, Greece, and Iran.9 This is due to the difference in ecological contexts of the two peoples. At the center of earliest Celtic culture was the cultivation of cereal grains which can be identified in central Europe from as early as 6000 B.C.1? This cultural technology remained at a subsistence level, never achieving the surpluses of Near Eastern agriculture which allowed for specialization and the urbanization of the area. Rather, these early peasant farmers lived in decentralized villages in which there is no 7 Arabagian, pp. 112, 120, 121-23. 8 The Goidel Celts were found in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Mann, as contrasted to the Brythonic Celts of Wales and Cornwall. 9 See Nora Chadwick, The Celts (New York: Penguin, 1970), chap. 1, "The Origins of the Celts: The Archaeological Evidence," for a thorough discussion of the agri- cultural foundations of Celtic culture. 10 Ibid., p. 19. 342</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions evidence of any cult centers or homes of chieftains." Later, this agrarian modality was modified by the influence of two groups with which it merged. The first was the Beaker Folk, thought to have originated in the Iberian peninsula in the later part of the third millennium B.C.; the other was the Stone Battle Ax people originating in low steppe lands of southern Russia. Both groups were herdsmen who valued horses, cattle, and war. Through the intermixture of these groups there emerged the Celts somewhere around the fifth century B.C."2 Due to this blending of peoples, there appeared as part of Celtic culture a warrior aristocracy, with the predominance of agriculture remaining. When we say the predominance of agriculture, we mean that there developed in Celtic culture many of the same cultural forms that attach themselves to less modified pastoral nomadic societies such as male leadership with an emphasis on war, aristocratic chieftainship, and the power of animals, particularly cattle and horses. These forms, however, were not sources of power which lay at the center of the culture but, rather, were dependent upon another power source for their existence. This power source was the earth which was imaged as a goddess and which sanctioned and made possible all of the mascu- line, pastoral nomadic structures mentioned above. Feminine power, for the most part, lay in the background, or more precisely under- ground in what was termed the Otherworld. It is clear, however, from a terse survey of Irish myth that male leadership was dependent upon the power of wisdom and regeneration known as sovereignty and was possessed by various feminine deities or demadeities. I will provide greater detail on this essential point shortly. What is important to emphasize for the present is that the cultural blend that constituted the Celts, especially in their Irish form, appears on the surface to be identical with pastoral nomadic cultures to which they are linguis- tically related, namely, the Indo-Europeans. However, when one takes seriously the importance of what Hultkrantz calls the ecology of religion and what we choose to term "cultural stratification," one must conclude that, based upon the centrality in technology of culti- vation and the dominance in mythology of earth goddesses over male II Ibid., p. 20. 12 There are various theories concerning the origins of the Celts; cf. Jean Markale, Celtic Civilization (Paris: Payot, 1976); T. G. E. Powell, The Celts (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1958); Stewart Piggott, Barbarian Europe (Edinburgh, 1965); Gerhard Herm, The Celts (New York: St. Martin's, 1975); etc. However, J. X. W. P. Corcoran writing in Chadwick's The Celts ("The Origins of the Celts: The Archaeological Evidence") seems to have the most compelling theory because it takes into consideration the ecological context as derived from archaeology and because it is corroborated by myth. 343</page><page sequence="5">Serpents, Cows, and Ladies divinities (note also the relative absence of a sky god), the "pastoral nomadic" structures must be interpreted through the eyes of the earth goddess and not the supreme god who dwells in the above. Just as the serpent must be interpreted differently in pastoral nomadic and cereal grain cultures, so too must the cattle raid be interpreted differently in Celtic culture and in the Indo-European or Indo-Aryan context. Finally, the connection of the Celts with Indo-European language and culture is primarily due to the influence of the Stone Battle Ax people. 13 What I wish to emphasize from this brief sketch of Celtic origins is the overriding importance of agriculture to the Celts, which was combined with a love for cattle and horses. The religious constellation that developed from this amalgam centered upon the sacrality of the earth as witnessed by consistent evidence of subterranean burial sites and later by the predominance of the goddess figure in the myths and sagas of the Celts. Further, what we know of ritual lends credence to the suggestion of a cosmic religious orientation. For example, one of the central rituals of pre-Christian Ireland was the inauguration of a chief (which occurred usually in the late autumn at a festival known as Samain). This rite involved the mating of the prospective chieftain with the land which was understood to be a goddess.14 The survival of the people was dependent on the sover- eignty of the chief, which was bestowed by the goddess, the land. Thus it becomes clear that survival was dependent upon the success of agriculture, not upon cattle raiding and hunting. These latter activities are made possible only by the bounty of the goddess, the land, and her fecundity. Because it was the goddess who bestowed sovereignty, we must conclude that we are dealing with a culture empowered by the feminine rather than a patriarchal culture such as found among the Indo-Europeans of India, Greece, and Iran. Based upon this distinction, that is, the distinction between the symbol systems that attend pastoral nomadic and agrarian cultures, we must make corresponding distinctions of interpretation between kingship, sovereignty, and the roles of the masculine and the feminine in the respective cultures. Kingship in both cases is dependent upon 13 See Chadwick, pp. 22-26, for evidence of this influence. Corcoran takes into consideration ecological context, archaeology, and language in his discussion. 14 See Alwyn Rees and Brinley Rees, Celtic Heritage (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1961), pp. 74, 75, for amplification of this point; see also Georges Dumezil, The Destiny of a King (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1973), chap. 5, for a discus- sion connecting the goddess with the land and with the sovereignty of the chief or king; also Proinsias MacCana, "Aspects of the Theme of King and Goddess in Irish Litera- ture, Parts 1-3," Etudes Celtiques 7 (1955): 76-114, 356-413; 8 (1956): 59-65. 344</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions the possession of sovereignty. Sovereignty in both cases is derived from a transcendent source, thus conferring upon the one who pos- sesses it a certain degree of sacrality. What is important is that the source of power differs within the two culture types, though the structure for its attainment, that is, the ritual of the winning of kingship, remains the same. In the Indo-European situation kingship is derived from the sovereignty of the male sky god, himself the king of the gods whether it be Agni, Varuna, Indra, or Zeus. This god is perceived as world creator and thus all-father, and through him sovereignty is conveyed to a male king on earth. As the sky god is the source of creation, the earth is dependent upon him. On the human level, the female is dependent upon the male, the subjects upon the king. 5 THE CULTURAL STRATUM OF THE CELTS AND SOME INTERPRETIVE IMPLICATIONS Even from my brief description, it is clear that the situation among the Celts, using the Irish example, is quite different from the Indo- European. To be sure, there are many structural similarities; the king is male and it is he who possesses sovereignty which he must in some sense win through a test. He is also granted this sovereignty from a divine figure. However, there occurs a cosmological reversal in the source of the power. Now it is derived from the earth rather than the sky, from the female rather than from the male. It is the goddess who is identical with the earth and all of Ireland who is the source, and thus, ontologically, the king is dependent upon the mother rather than the father, though a mating between the two is necessary to bring about her revitalization. This mating must be understood as a sacrifice. He gives up his life, his seed, for her sake, so that she might live again (thus allowing his own life to continue). The pattern is cyclical, based upon the lunar theme of death and rebirth. In pastoral, nomadic, or historical cultures it is the earth herself who is sacrificed for the sake of the establishment upon her face of history, the divine kingdom of the sky god, the Rama Raj. Further, the sky god gives the king a mandate to extend the kingdom to the ends of the earth; thus his goal as sovereign is to be Chakravartin or universal ruler. In the Irish case, kingship is married or tied to a place; the king cannot move from there due to his vow of marriage. Both the scale and the attitude are different. In the 15 See Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, chap. 2, for a thorough discussion of the sky god and his relationship to sovereignty. 345</page><page sequence="7">Serpents, Cows, and Ladies Indo-European situation kingship and its power are explosive, moving outward from a center. In the Celtic Irish example the power of the king is implosive; it moves in upon itself. The former results in a centralized, urbanized culture, the latter in a decentralized village culture such as was present in Ireland until the coming of the Vikings in the ninth century A.D. These reflections require a rethinking of the notion of sovereignty common structurally to both cultures. We can retain our ordinary understanding of sovereignty when thinking of the Indo-European case, that is, sovereignty as dominion in an absolute sense over all. However, in the Irish meaning of the word, sovereignty, because she is a woman, carries a sense of "being with" rather than "being above" or distant from its object. It also conveys a sense of containment present in being in a place surrounded by its power. Finally, the power of sovereignty bestows upon its holder the gift of wisdom and vision, in actuality an ability to dream dreams. One of the personifi- cations of the goddess of sovereignty to whom the king is wed is Flaith. The Irish word flaith translates as sovereignty but also has associations in myth with strong drink or intoxication. Dumezil notes this association but seeks to circumvent its symbolic implications.'6 When one chooses not to avoid the symbolic, what remains is an identity between woman/goddess, beer/intoxication, and wisdom/ vision.l7 This identity is further supported by the alternate translation of Medb, another personification of the goddess of the land, as intoxication. Finally, the word medb has cognates in Welsh (meddw, drunk) and English (mead).18 One final amplification of the agrarian/feminine foundations of Irish Celtic culture should be made before moving on. I wish now to draw upon myth as a source of interpretation. The myth of Niall and his four half-brothers seems to tie together the themes I have empha- sized. In this myth Niall and his half-brothers are given weapons by a smith and go to a wood in order to hunt. There they get lost and rest, building a fire to cook the game taken for repast. One of the brothers is sent for water. He comes to a spring or well which is guarded by a black hag who demands a kiss in return for the water. Fergus, the brother of Niall, refuses. The four other brothers follow, all refusing, though Fiachra grazes her cheek. Niall, however, does not refuse, and 16 Dumezil, pp. 92-93. 17 The Rees brothers do accept the givenness of this symbolism and suggest that the quality of the wisdom is that of a visionary or intuitive type. They go on to state that "sovereignty is a bride, the server of a powerful drink, and the drink itself" (Rees and Rees, p. 76). 18 Ibid. 346</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions when he opens his eyes after the embrace, he beholds "the most beautiful woman in the world."'9 This woman reveals herself as sovereignty (Flaith), gives him the drink, then states that he will be king and his descendants will follow him. The water given from the well is likened to ale-"smooth shall be thy draught from the royal horn, 'twill be mead, 'twill be honey, 'twill be strong ale."20 The structure of the myth reflects the agrarian cycle of the waning of the season of fecundity and its rebirth in springtime. The woman at the well is not only sovereignty but also the land Ireland. It is she who chooses the king by his willingness to mate with her, and in return she intoxicates him with her wisdom through their union. She is the source of power, a power that can only be gained through a union with death in the form of the hag. This union is the sacrifice necessary for the rebirth of the land and the inauguration of a new king. Thus the king is the archfecundator and sovereignty is the intoxicating power of his union with the goddess. He, too, will grow old and will be replaced by a younger, more virile man, but the goddess, like the moon, merely waxes and wanes.21 When examined carefully through the eyes of agrarian rather than pastoral nomadic interpretive structures, the cattle-raid myth reveals itself as a further reflex or amplification of the themes set forth in the myth of the hag at the well. As Lincoln points out, embedded in the cattle raid is a cycle in which the cattle move from the hero to the 19 Ibid., p. 73. 20 Ibid., p. 75. This tale is also summarized by Dumezil, p. 89, along with the tale of King Daire and his son Lugaid Laigde, who sleeps with the hag who again is trans- formed into a beautiful woman. A similar tale is described by Marie-Louise Sjoestedt (Gods and Heroes of the Celts [Berkeley: Turtle Island Foundation, 1982], pp. 41-42), in which kingship is assumed by a woman, the goddess Macha, who, in the guise of a leper, sleeps with the five sons of King Dithorba. It is important to note the number of sons is five in these cases. Lincoln points out the importance of the "third" or three sons in Indo-European heroic myth (Priests, Warriors, Cattle, p. 113). The conclusion, once again, is that the five sons reflect the five provinces of the land, Ireland. Thus a spatial rather than hierarchal motif is in play, feminine rather than masculine. To be sure, the number three is important-e.g., the three virtues demanded by the prospec- tive king and husband of Queen Medb (Dumezil, pp. 88-93). Note also that Queen Medb takes five husbands, again reflecting the totality of Ireland. Where threeness is important in Irish tradition we suggest that it symbolizes not the levels of the cosmos or three social classes, but the three phases of the triple goddess, in this case all contained in Medb (Dumezil, p. 92) and reflected in her husbands through her mating with them. The three virtues are lack of jealousy (youthful maiden), lack of niggardli- ness (matron), and lack of fear (hag of death). Sjoestedt (p. 47) confirms this when she associates tripleness with goddesses and singleness with gods: "By their triple na- ture... the Irish goddesses... reveal a mentality more archaic than that which finds expression in the persons of the male gods who are clearly anthropomorphic and simple." 21 Sjoestedt, p. 61, notes the different rhythm of gods and goddesses with respect to sea divinities: "While goddesses survive, the sea gods succeed each other." 347</page><page sequence="9">Serpents, Cows, and Ladies foreigners and back again to the hero.22 Thus there is a common structure to both the cattle-raid and hag myths, that of cyclical movement. In both myths there is a death and a rebirth which is in relationship to the mating or separation of the masculine and the femi- nine or the king and queen. In other words, the hag and cattle-raid myths reflect the seasonal cycle of death and rebirth of the land and of the tuath, the Irish political unit identified with the land or place in which they dwell. When the chief mates with the hag, spring comes and the tribe gains new life. In the case of the cattle raid, king and queen are represented by the hero and his cattle. In some myths the cows are the possession of a lady; thus a symbolic equation is estab- lished between cattle, queen, and cow lady. The lady and the cows are one.23 When the cows are stolen, symbolic death of the land ensues. When they are recovered, rebirth occurs. One might now reflect that the Indo-European cattle raid follows the same structural cycle. Does it also, then, present us with the symbolism of agrarian death and rebirth? To answer this question it is fruitful to consider the differing cultural ecologies of Indo-Euro- peans and Celts. Because of the early influence of Indo-European peoples on the formation of Celtic culture the importance of the cattle raid was maintained. But it was given a different interpretation in the Celtic situation due to the dominance of agriculture. Thus in the Indo-European case we have the quest of the hunter/pastoral nomad for booty and treasure which, in keeping with pastoral no- madic or historical cultures, expands the power of the king and his people. As Lincoln suggests, the raid is a model for world creation or expansion. It has cosmogonic implications. The Irish case also contains cosmogonic implications, in that it is through the death and rebirth or sacrifice of the prospective chieftain to the hag, often expressed through the giving up of his life through 22 Lincoln, "The Indo-European Myth of Creation" (n. 1 above), pp. 33-35, 69. 23 Arabagian points out that bride-stealing and cattle-raiding myths have a common structure and that the booty in both is the feminine, i.e., cattle and women. Thus there is a structural and symbolic identity between the two. Arabagian states, "A woman can take the place of a cow without changing the basic story" (Arabagian [n. 2 above], p. 110). Lincoln makes the same identification between cow and woman in his Priests, Warriors, Cattle, pp. 108-9. It follows from the identification of cow and woman that cow and goddess are one. This identity is played out in various myths of storm gods symbolized as bulls mating with the Earth Mother, symbolized as a cow; see Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, p. 83. Arabagian also draws this conclusion: "Both cow (with bull as her consort) and bride are goddesses" (p. 118). Finally, certain tales of the Morrigan and CuChulainn in the Tain (Thomas Kinsella, The Tain [Dublin: Oxford University Press, 1972], pp. 132-37) make clear the symbolic identity of cow and goddess. 348</page><page sequence="10">History of Religions his seed, his mating with the goddess, or his immolation,24 that the land is reborn in both a political and a natural sense. This cosmogonic theme is transposed into the cattle raid as suggested above. The cosmogonic process, however, is a cyclical one of death and rebirth rather than the theme of infinite expansion contained in pastoral nomadic creative acts and reflected in the drive to gain more and more cattle. The clearest evidence of the contextual differentiation that exists between the Indo-Europeans and the Celts as expressed in the cattle- raid myth lies in the source of life which is equally the source of cattle. It is the source of life that determines or gives evidence of the type of religious ecology and cultural strata of the people involved. In all cases of the Indo-European cattle-raid myths the cattle are given by the celestial sovereign or sky god.25 This is also true among other pastoral nomadic peoples such as the Masai, the Dinka, and the Nuer.26 Central to the religious symbol system of pastoral nomads and nomadic hunters is the sky god,27 a sovereign deity who is world creator and giver of all life. It is the particular symbolic dynamic of this sovereign creator god that determines the nature of all creative events that occur in the world of men and the gods.28 Creation in this mode is schematized as linear and when highly developed becomes historical, that is, events occur once and for all.29 In the Irish situation it is the goddess, identified with the earth and playing the triple role of lover, mother, and warrior, that is the giver of all life and thus of cattle, with whom she is identified.30 In Ireland 24 See William Sayers, "Fergus and the Cosmogonic Sword," History of Religions 25, no. 1 (August 1985): 30 ff., for a provocative identification of this theme. 25 Lincoln, Priests, Warriors, Cattle, pp. 59, 68-69. 26 Ibid., pp. 19, 20. 27 See Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion (n. 5 above), pp. 38-46. All of the tribes mentioned in this section are either pastoral nomads or nomadic hunters. Common to symbolism of the sky deity is the importance of animals, e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, or hunted wild animals. In my thinking there are several reasons why the sky is central symbolically to herders and nomadic hunters. Primary among them is the resemblance of the open range or hunting ground to the vastness and openness of the sky. Earth, the world of the nomad, becomes a reflection and thus a symbol of the sky to which it points and in which it participates. Second, the sky is the primary transcendent reality in the lives of nomads because of its ever-presence, due to the openness of the land on which they dwell. 28 See ibid., pp. 410-23, for a discussion of the paradigmatic function of cosmogonic myths and their creator gods. 29 The clearest example of this phenomenon is found in the hierophany of the sky god Yahweh and the development of the sacred history that is the Bible. 30 Sjoestedt (n. 20 above), p. 30, makes clear the identification of Celtic goddesses with the earth, fertility, and life; see also T. F. O'Rahilly, Eriu 14: 14 ff. for evidence of 349</page><page sequence="11">Serpents, Cows, and Ladies there is no single or clearly defined cosmogonic myth. In order to discern the cosmogonic process, one must look in many myths and through an abstracting of cosmogonic themes arrive at a general and hypothetical notion of the essence and structure of cosmogony. Let us examine some of these themes: Ireland was not created from nothing but always existed in primal form. Creation was a process of amplify- ing, adorning, or furnishing the givenness of the land who is a woman. We see this in the Lebhar Gabhala Erin or the Book of the Taking of Ireland. Here a series of invasions people Ireland and with them various significant configurations of the land are created, such as plains and lakes that exist today. This same creative theme is used in the Tain, in which fords, mountains, and plains are created by the events which occur there and to which their names are given. Finally, The Metrical Dindsenchus, a portion of the twelfth-century Lebhar Laignech or Book of Leinster, carries on this cosmogonic theme through a mythic history of place names which unveils their meaning and thus their creation. A second important cosmogonic motif is that of flooding. Water in Irish myth is symbolic of the goddess and of her life-giving power. Thus the primary goddess with whom the chieftain mates is often a goddess of a river or well.31 There is a tale in the Lebhar na Huidre which tells of the rape of a woman who guards a magic spring in Ulster.32 The spring overflows, flooding the land and drowning King Ecca. His daughter, Libane, escapes and lives for a year at the bottom of Lough Neagh where she is transformed into a salmon. Three hundred years later she emerges as the Goddess Morrigan. Here the flood is a creative event, bringing about the renewal of the world. Jean Markale puts it succinctly: "The overflowing spring is obviously a sexual symbol of fertility. The woman guarding it is identified with the spring, just as the vagina is symbolized by the well. The fact that once raped she becomes fertile is sufficient an argument to suggest that the myth of the flood is not always a myth of punishment and destruction."33 Further, Markale goes on to contrast the symbols of drought and flood, both central to new birth and cosmogony. Drought, the goddess of the land and her mating with the prospective king. For symbolic identity between cow and goddess, see Kinsella, pp. 132-37. 31 The Dagda, paradigmatic chieftain god of the Irish, is united on two occasions with the river goddess during Samain, the festival of the new year, November 1. This festival marks the beginning of a new cycle and recapitulates the primordial beginnings of the world. The two river goddesses are Morrigan, here associated with the river Unius, and Boann, goddess of the sacred river Boyne. 32 Standish O'Grady, Silva Gadelica (London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1892) 1: 233-37; 2: 255-59. 33 Markale (n. 12 above), p. 24. 350</page><page sequence="12">History of Religions however, is important cosmogonically among pastoral peoples living in arid or semi-arid environments, while flood is important to the Celts and thus to agrarian people in need of its fertilizing powers.34 In Celtic Ireland, then, it is the goddess identified with the earth and most essentially with water, who is the source of all life, all abundance, including cattle. This fact contrasts strongly with the evidence of cattle being derived from the sky god in Indo-European cultures. Due to this difference in the source of creation, the sym- bolism that arises in the respective cultures is as different as the sky god is from the Earth Mother. The former is a warrior shepherd associated with the creativity of drought and fire, the latter a Great Mother associated with the creativity of moisture and flood. There follows from this the contrasting symbolism of sobriety and intoxica- tion, virginity and sexual promiscuity, each related to their respective cultural stratum. Many more amplifications could be made. Suffice it to say that when there appears a structure such as the cattle raid that is common to two differing cultural strata, it must be interpreted through the eyes of the appropriate cultural and symbolic motifs. In the case of the Celts, these motifs are primarily agrarian. SOME CONCLUSIONS REGARDING INDO-EUROPEAN AND CELTIC CULTURAL STRATA Let us return now to the suggestions concerning the cattle-raid myth presented at the outset of this study by Lincoln and Arabagian and see how they may be modified or amplified by the research contained above. Lincoln's primary thesis is that the Indo-European cattle-raid myth presents us with the mythic model for the warrior class of Indo- European society. Included among examples of the Indo-European cattle-raiding myth is the Tain Bo Cuailnge originating in Ireland. Arabagian's primary concern is to show that the theme of cattle raiding and bride stealing display the subjugation of the earlier great goddess to a male heroic figure. As does Lincoln, she includes Irish examples along with Indian and Iranian myths of Indo-European origin, indicating her equation of Celtic and Indo-European cultures. Arabagian, however, does notice that there seems to be an exception in Irish myth to the Indian subjugation of women and the goddess to the male figures. She accounts for this by suggesting that this tendency was not originally part of Indo-European heritage but resulted from the defeat of chthonic cultures by Indo-European ones. Both authors 34 Markale writes, "The Hebraic tradition, in which woman's status was diminished and god became a solitary male warrior or shepherd, and the Islamic religion which it inspired, were both conceived by nomads used to the dryness of the desert" (p. 33). 351</page><page sequence="13">Serpents, Cows, and Ladies support and appeal to the methodological tool of cultural ecology as established by Julian Steward and later amplified by Ake Hultkrantz as ecology of religion. Arabagian encapsulates her view regarding this interpretative tool in the following: "But I would like to suggest that the trends outlined here are not limited to the geographical areas focused upon in this paper; rather, they are universally human and might be discovered in all regions through which pastoralists and warrior ideologies have moved-and that means world wide. It appears to be a question of similar ecological conditions creating simi- larly patterned societies and mythologies."35 At the end of this state- ment she footnotes Lincoln's reference to Hultkrantz's work. I agree heartily with the importance placed upon cultural ecology and ecology of religion by both authors; however, I feel that they did not use the tool where it was needed. Had Arabagian been aware of the primary nature of agriculture in the life of the Celts, the apparent anomaly of Ireland could have been resolved. Because of the difference in the cultural cores of the Indo-European pastoralists and the Celtic agriculturalists there results a differing religious ecology in both traditions. Thus the power of women and the feminine will be at opposite poles even though there remain, due to earlier common influences cited above, mythic structures such as cattle raiding and bride stealing present in both traditions. Given these differing religious ecologies, religious structures, though common to both cultures, must be interpreted in the light of the religious ecology that attaches itself to the tradition in question. Thus Indo-European material must be understood through the view of the male-oriented pastoralist and Celtic material through the view of the female-oriented agrarian. Fundamental to the differences between these two culture types is the source of power within the ecological stratum. We equate power with life in its broadest sense, and so the source of power is also the source of creation or cosmogony. It is this source that provides the creative model for all other cultural acts and which establishes the ethos or quality of cultural colorings. If the locus of power is the same between two cultures, then the cultural and religious ecology will be essentially the same, despite structural overlays that may lead one to think otherwise. If the source of power is different in its locus, then the essential perspective, ethos, or worldview will be different between two cultures, despite any structural similarities that may exist for various reasons. 35 Ibid., p. 125. 352</page><page sequence="14">History of Religions In the case of Celtic and Indo-European culture types we find two very different sources of power and thus of life and cosmogony. In the Indo-European situation the source of power resides in the sky or heavens and is imaged in the form of sky gods of various types. These gods are male and are the models for all creative acts. It is they who provide the essential male and celestial orientation to Indo-European cultures. These myths do function, as Lincoln suggests, as models for creative activity which have to do in a general sense with subjugating the earth/goddess/cow and transforming her into the law of heaven. In the case of the Celts, I suggested that the source of power resides in the earth which is imaged as a great goddess or series of goddesses. It is these goddesses who are the source of creation and all creative acts. Therefore, despite the common social structure and mythic themes in Indo-European and Celtic cultures, within the Celtic world, things are viewed from a feminine perspective. In the Celtic cattle- raiding myths it is the Lady who either aids the lover directly against her father, as in the case of Findabar and Fraich, or who complies with or abets his efforts to steal her and her cattle, as in the case of Flidais and the seven daughters of Regamon. Power, aid, and sover- eignty always come from the earth as goddess, fairy lover, or cow. The cattle-raiding myth structure, then, must be interpreted differ- ently in Celtic and Indo-European cultures, and for interpretative purposes concerning symbols, Celtic and Indo-European cultures must not be equated, despite common linguistic roots. Finally, the cattle-raiding myths in Celtic cultures, as well as in the Indo-European situation, function as a reflex of the cosmogony. In the Celtic myth, which is the primary concern of this article, we see that the ontology of the myth intends the revivification of the earth and her consort through a sacrifice and integrative union. This inten- tionality is demonstrated not only by the story line of the myth but also by movement of characters within the myth. For example, there is a circular movement of cattle from son figure to Lady and back to son accompanied by Lady. This movement recapitulates the creative function of the great round. Further, there is a centering and inte- grating movement within the myth. The son or puer moves to the Lady and her father, then to the center where an initiatory battle integrates Lady and son, redeeming the father. The son and father are united, as are the hag and Lady. The ultimate union occurs between the son and Lady and is echoed through the symbolic homogeniza- tion of cow and serpent. Thus the world is recreated each year through the death and rebirth of the hag/earth Lady and her consort, the son/father. 353</page><page sequence="15">354 Serpents, Cows, and Ladies Both Lincoln and Arabagian brought to light important dimen- sions of the cattle-raiding myth, namely, the paradigmatic and creative function of the myth and the balance of masculine and feminine power as expressed through the myth. In addition, they established the use of the ecology of religion as a tool for refining comparative studies and linking phenomenological interpretation once again with experience and situation. It is hoped that I have amplified their work through the carrying on of these methods. University of Vermont</page></plain_text>
