Although both copyists were as faithful as their talents allowed, they claimed Schongauer's work as their own with their signatures. Their engravings are adver- tisements of their modernity, proving they too could speak in the disciplined graphic syntax just invented by Schongauer. When, a generation later, Albrecht Durer undertook a series of woodcuts on the life and death of the Virgin, he too appropriated Schongauer's composition, bringing its perspective up-to- date and otherwise demonstrating his assimi- lation of Italian art. In an inscription below his impression of Schongauer's version, a sixteenth-century collector noted the progression from the last genius of the Gothic print to the first of the German Renaissance. Schongauer's engraving had been "judged in my youth to be the finest work of art to have come out of Germany," but "once the unsurpassed Durer ... began to make his art, this no longer holds" (Landau and Parshall, The Renaissance Print, 1994). That such progress was made in so short a time and over so broad an area-Schongauer's and Wenzel's work sites fall outside Germany's present borders-is testimony not only to the imaginative power of the image but also to the international impact of the new art form-the printed multiple-at the end of the fifteenth century. -MBC it.

At the center of the Last Judgment is Christ's separation of the blessed from the damned. That moment is symbolized here by the sword and the lily ("From his mouth issues a sharp sword with which to smite the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron"-Rev. 19:15). According to a late-nineteenth-century source, this painting came from the Dominican Church at Bruges, although there is no men- tion of it in early inventories and the location for which it was commissioned is unknown. Paintings of the Last Judgment were not always placed in religious contexts. They were frequently placed in courtrooms, where they helped to underscore the legitimacy of the court's authority and to remind its magistrates of their duty to remain just and fair. Only the chosen are shown at the bottom of this Last Judgment, leaving the damned to exam- ine themselves outside the parameters of the frame. -Sw PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER Netherlandish, 1525-1569 Wooded Landscape with a Distant View towards the Sea, 1554 Brown ink, brown wash, white gouache, and black chalk on blue antique laid paper; 260 x 344 mm The Maida and George Abrams Collection, 1999.132 This drawing is exceptional in many respects. Of the approximately thirty brown ink and brown wash land- scapes by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, it is the only one heightened with white gouache and executed on blue Venetian paper; it is also one of the few that is both signed and dated. Of note is Bruegel's trans- lation of his stylistic vocabulary to suit the broader medium, highlighting the foliage and substituting positive strokes of white gouache in the lower skies and the dales of his land- scapes for the fine parallel pen lines and stipple with which he usually suggested depth. In 1554 Bruegel was in Rome, the last stop of his two-year travel and sketching activities in Italy. The only other drawing dated 1554 in his oeuvre is a landscape (now in Berlin) on cream Italian paper after Domenico Campagnola. That sheet shares characteristic features such as the weeds under the great tree, the comparatively small hunched peas- ants, and the summarily sketched cow on the dale. In the Fogg drawing, Bruegel's choice of white gouache and the complementary blue paper seems experimental, leaving us with this single example of his ability to use the medium to energize his landscape with a sparkling radiance. -0MB -~~~~~~~~~~ -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I~~~~~~" A U0, ~ ~ - 1 43</page><page sequence="4">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 JACOB GRIMMER Netherlandish, C. 1525-1590 Landscape with Cottages, 1561 Oil on wood panel, 59.2 x 98.5 cm Melvin R. Seiden Purchase Fund in honor of William W Robinson, 1992.58 AL In the sixteenth century, landscape emerged as an independent subject in painting. Grimmer was recognized by Giorgio Vasari and Karel van Mander as a master of this genre and was acclaimed as one of the finest landscape artists of his day. Grimmer's painting inspired other artists to produce works in his manner, and his style of painting lasted into the seventeenth century in the practice of his son, Abel. Mas- terfully executed, this well-preserved painting is one of the earliest that is both signed with the artist's monograph and dated. Gentle puffs of smoke waft from cottages scat- tered along the pastoral banks of an expansive body of water in this vast and open landscape. The smoke indicates human activity. How- ever, in contrast to the outdoor stages of many paintings by Grimmer (and his fellow Antwerper Pieter Bruegel) that serve as theaters to display vignettes of robust peasant life, the subtle appeal of this painting is that we are left to imagine the buzz of activity taking place within the confines of these dwellings, nestled in the verdant slopes of this bucolic setting. -sw PAOLO CALIARI, CALLED VERONESE Italian, 1528-1588 Studies for "Paradise," c. 1582-83 Brown ink and brown wash over black chalk on cream antique laid paper, 215 x 312 mm Purchased through the generosity of an Anonymous Donor, 1994.152 PALMA GIOVANE Italian, c. 1548-1628 Study for "Paradise," c. 1582-83 Brown ink and brown wash over black chalk on cream antique laid paper, 295 x 564 mm Gift of Donald Outerbridge and Robert M.

Paolo Veronese, Palma Giovane, Federico Zuccaro, Francesco Bassano, and Jacopo Tintoretto submitted oil sketches. Veronese won the commission but died before the work progressed. The assignment passed to Tintoretto, who produced the gigantic Paradise still in situ. Of Veronese's four surviv- ing studies for this project, the Fogg sketch is the only one that shows the entire composi- tion. A detailed study for the band of angelic musicians at the upper left of Veronese's oil modello is at the bottom right of the Fogg sheet, which also bears the artist's autograph notes identifying the holy personages to be represented in the picture. Palma Giovane's compara- tively finished drawing is probably his final design on paper prior to the execution of the painted modello he submitted to the competi- tion. While it shows numer- ous differences from the oil sketch, the principal features of the composition were fixed in the drawing. The shape of the paper takes into account the doorways on both sides of the wall and the bank of seats for the doge and his council beneath the center of the painting. -WWR PETER PAUL RUBENS Flemish, 1577-1640 Saint Peter and Saint Paul, c. 1615 Oil on wood, each 65.5 x 48.5 cm Bequest of Lore Heinemann in memory of her husband, Dr. RudolfJ.

Among other types of work, he produced devotional paintings to refurbish churches and monasteries that had been damaged by Protestant reformers. The ultimate prototype for Rubens's pendants is a pair of venerated icons in the papal Sancta Sanctorum chapel. These were identified with the likenesses of Saints Peter and Paul that Pope Saint Sylvester had purportedly shown to the emperor Constantine. Constantine is said to have recognized them as the visitors in his nightly dreams, prompting him to convert to Christianity. The icons (which actually long postdate the fourth century) therefore sanc- tioned the claims to primacy of the Roman Church and the place of the veneration of images within it. Rubens's panels thus con- form to a militant Counter- Reformation theology upholding the authority of Rome and the veneration of images, though the artist invested his saints with a vigor and intimacy novel in European art. The panels were bequeathed by Lore Heinemann in memory of her husband, Rudolf, who for most of his career as a scholar-dealer was the principal advisor on old master paintings for the great collectors Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and his son, Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. -IG *: 47</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 REMBRANDT HARMENSZ.

In this print we see Rembrandt bending tradi- tional method to achieve a variety of spatial, textural, and coloristic effects. Coincident with the characteristic technique perfected in his landscape etchings of the 1640s, etching is here mixed with drypoint to allow additional free- dom in handling, in the assortment of lines available for use, and in the range of tones and textures. Compressed in space behind the recumbent sow, the figures and background are sketched out with a minimum of lightly bitten lines, the better to emphasize the elabo- rately rendered animal. As in the landscapes, drypoint lines are used both to reinforce the etched line-as in the contour of the sow- and, according to Arthur M. Hind, to "add cogency to the whole by proper local empha- sis." Around its head and chest, loose, deeply etched lines intimate the beast's shaggy coat. On its back and flank, a series of regular, closely drawn etching and drypoint hatchings denote the matted thickness of the fur. On the underside of its hindquarter, the luminous effect achieved through the drypoint burr accents the silvery softness of the delicate pelage, in contrast to the sharper lineal shad- ing of the rump. Rembrandt evidently etched as he drew, using a deliberate mixture of reticulated, sinuous, and pulsating lines to reveal the hand that drew them. -BML BARTHOLOMEUS BREENBERGH Dutch, 1598-1657 Venus Mourning the Death of Adonis, 1646 Oil on wood, 38.7 x 49.5 cm The Kate, Maurice R. and Melvin R. Seiden Special Purchase Fund, Janine Luke, The Louis Agassiz Shaw Bequest, William and Ami Danoff in honor of Seymour Slive, 1997.5 Breenbergh was born in Deventer, but between 1619 and 1629 he was one of many Netherlandish painters working in Rome, where he was a member of the Schildersbent, the Dutch and Flemish painters' association. Its members were known by nicknames, and Breenbergh's was "Weasel." He probably left Italy in 1629 and by 1633 had settled in Amster- dam, where he remained for the rest of his life. Classical ideals and the conventions of Italian history painting in depicting heightened emo- tions continued to inform Breenbergh's work in Amsterdam, together with a meticulous concern for detail and a refined technique. These qualities appealed to a classically educated, cosmopolitan constituency in the commercial capital of mid-seventeenth- century northern Europe. The version of Ovid's Metamorphoses by the artist and theorist Karel van Mander was 48</page><page sequence="9">FOGG ART MUSEUM .. . . .. the most frequently used source of classical subject matter by Dutch artists in the seven- teenth century. In Ovid's tale (Metamorphoses, 10:708-39), Adonis is attacked by a boar while hunting, and his fallen blood marks where the first anemones will grow. Venus has descended from her swan-drawn chariot and grieves over her mortally wounded favorite. A study (1996.303) in oiled charcoal and chalk for the figure of Adonis also recently entered the Fogg's collections. IG ALESSANDRO ALGARDI Italian, 1595-1652 Virgin and Child, c. 1650 Bronze, h. 54 cm (figure, 48.3 cm) Promised Gift of Alexis Gregory, New York, TL35286.49 Other examples of this invention exist in various materials, but none in bronze is finer or more carefully chased than this early cast. The figure is cast integrally with the pedestal and has a chocolate-brown patina beneath the dark brown lacquer. Although an intimate sculpture, the divided attention of the Virgin and Christ child toward different supplicants implies a monu- mental conception. It is closely related to the Virgin and Child for the altar of the church of S. Nicola da Tolentino in Rome, on which Algardi was working in 1650. While the Christ child's gesture is informal and his left arm rests casually on the Virgin's shoulder, the Virgin suggests the conveyance of an object to a devotee. This is most likely a rosary, associated with the Dominicans, or a scapular, associated with the Carmelites. The ambiguity may have been deliberate in order to increase the work's appeal to a wide range of devotional persuasions. .daddbk.- 49</page><page sequence="10">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 There is no firm documentation for this invention, though a cast was probably owned by the sculptor Ercole Ferrata, as recorded in his inventory. It was swiftly imitated by Jean del Cour, attesting to its success. The Alexis Gregory Collection of Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes was exhibited at the Fogg in 1996, accompanied by a catalogue by Charles Avery. Mr. Gregory has generously promised the collection to the Art Museums. -IG REMBRANDT HARMENSZ. VAN RIJN Dutch, 1606-1669 A Farm on the Amsteldijk, Seen from the North, c. 1650-52 Brown ink, brown wash, and white gouache on cream antique laid paper; 109 X 221 mm The Maida and George Abrams Collection, Promised Gift, 25.1998.57 This drawing is not only a beautiful evocation of a farm nestled among trees on a windless midsummer's day, but is also a documentary record of a farmyard on the polder along the outer bend of the Amstel around 1650-52. Rembrandt drew at least four versions of the same thatched barn, from the north, west, and south. We can surmise that this landscape was finished in the studio, probably after a sketch, because of the careful application of wash to describe tonalities in light and shade, such as the flickering patches under the branches on the roof. With three deft pen lines, Rembrandt suggested the reflection of the reeds in the glassy water; similarly, he used just a few brush strokes both to describe the primitive retain- ing wall along the edge of the canal and to create an immediate sense of space and depth. To indicate the faint horizon he used a half- dry pen. The drawing stems from a group of twenty-seven landscapes acquired in 1723 by the second duke of Devonshire from the son of Rembrandt's pupil Govert Flinck. -OMB - 4,-~~~~~~Z r&gt;7 ,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4 4q-^F 50</page><page sequence="11">FOGG ART MUSEUM _ . . __._ . __ _ . . ... .. _ __.__ ....... _ _ ._ ... . .... .. . ..

This drawing belongs to a group of sixteen expressive sheets, executed entirely with the brush and brown wash, that are unique among seventeenth- century Dutch figure studies. In this superb sheet, van den Eeckhout skillfully used the broad medium and technique to describe the quiet contemplation of this woman absorbed in her needlework. Through subtle tonalities of wash, he established volume in areas such as the shadow under her sleeve, and he used the point of the brush to describe details such as her nimble fingers. The studies, dated to around 1655, are indicative of van den Eeckhout's versatility: In addition to history paintings, the artist created landscapes and domestic genre pieces, to which this drawing, though not a study for any particular painting, is related. -OMB 51</page><page sequence="12">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 GIAN LORENZO BERNINI, OR WORKSHOP Italian, 1598-1680 Saint Ambrose, 1658 Low-fired clay with later gilding and paint, h. 36.2 cm Richard Norton, William M. Prichard Memo- rial, and Louise Haskell Daly Funds, 1995.60 Early in 1657 Bernini began work on a design for a reliquary for the episcopal chair of Saint Peter to dominate the apse of the Basilica of Saint Peter, Rome. He conceived of four Fathers of the Church lightly supporting the sacred reliquary below an elaborate Gloria. Surviving drawings, documents, and models allow us to follow the course of the nine-year project and to define the place of the Fogg model within it. The Fogg model corresponds to the second model of Saint Ambrose, which Bernini is known to have presented for Pope Alexander VII's inspection on 7 April 1658. Further modifications would be made before the giant bronze figure was cast in September 1662. Although Bernini controlled the conception of this complex scheme, much was delegated to collaborators and assistants, often highly respected sculptors in their own right. For instance, the sculptors Ercole Ferrata, Antonio Raggi, and Lazzaro Morelli were paid for a set of four models of the church fathers the previous year. The Fogg model was subsequently treated as an independent sculpture and, over the centu- ries, received no fewer than five coats of gild- ing and metallic paint. The work was first identified in 1943 but remained in private hands and was only illustrated once prior to its acquisition in 1995. -IG CLAUDE LORRAIN French, 1600-1682 Landscape with the Triumph of David, c. i66o Brown ink, brown wash, black chalk, and white gouache on off-white antique laid paper; 228 x 346 mm The Kate, Maurice R. and Melvin R.

Sachs, and John Coolidge, by exchange, 1996.4 This rare, documented eighteenth-century student desk was used and inscribed by two generations of Harvard undergraduates: J. Gyles Merrill (1738/39-i8oi), Class of 1759, and his son, James Cushing Merrill (1784- 1853), Class of 1807. Gyles Merrill was pastor of the Old North Church in Haverhill, Mass., from 1765 until his death. His son James, a lawyer who represented Boston in the state legislature, was a member of the Examining Committee for Greek at Harvard. The style of the leg turnings suggests that this desk is of earlier manufacture than its first recorded use in 1755, the date of the elder Merrill's inscription. The pull-out writing surface and the pale blue-gray that covers the original red stain or paint appear to be early- nineteenth-century additions and may be attempts by the son to update his father's desk. These modifications demonstrate the practical adaptation of modest, functional furniture forms over successive generations. The alumni origins and the later acquisition of this desk are emblematic of the importance that Harvard places on preserving and per- petuating its history and traditions. The desk was acquired in 1996 when it was sold by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. -SBK 53</page><page sequence="14">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 SEBASTIANO Ricci Italian, 1659-1734 The Baptism of Christ, 1713-14 Oil on canvas, 68.5 x 103 cm Gift of Horace W Brock in memory of his parents, Hope and Horace Brock, 1994.173 This painting is a preparatory sketch, or modello, for a series of biblical narratives for the chapel of Bulstrode House in England. In 1712, Ricci left northern Italy for England in the hope of securing royal patronage and the commission to paint the great cupola of Saint Paul's Cathedral, London. Unsuccessful in his attempt to obtain either, he settled on the private patronage of such figures as the earl of Burlington and then the earl of Portland, the proprietor of Bulstrode. Bulstrode was entirely rebuilt in 1862, and all that can be reclaimed of Ricci's project for its chapel are written descriptions and a group of oil sketches. The program consisted of a series of narratives presented as theatrical sketches within a fictive architectural framework. Painted windows above the altar would have dramatically illuminated the entire expanse of scenes. The tableau of the Baptism stood opposite that of the Last Supper, and an Annunciation filled the wall facing the altar. The chapel's ceiling dissolved to reveal an image of the Ascension, the composition of which may be recorded in an oil sketch in the Shipley Art Gallery, England. This canvas is the most worked and polished of the three surviving studies of the Baptism of Christ and relates closely to a modello of the Last Supper now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. -sw .. 4 _ = = $ F . . . , r .q,- x ,.

It has been surmised that the figures were inspired by literary or dramatic sources, but animated drawings from the 1790S of Venetian life by Giandomenico Tiepolo (1727-1804) show much the same cast of characters. Here David has employed the most modern printmaking technique, aquatint, which had been introduced barely a decade earlier. His washed and burnished modulations can be seen as high-tech versions of Tiepolo's laboriously drawn networks of tiny etched hatchings, through which the older artist established the tonal registers of his prints. Tiepolo returned to Venice from Spain in 1770, the same year David arrived as the protege of the Genoese ambassador to Venice, and the younger artist was undoubtedly familiar with the older man's work, especially his widely circulated etchings. Though David was himself a practiced etcher and could have emulated these, he chose to try the newest fashion, and his ease in the new medium is astonishing. Note especially the shimmering stripes of the gondolier's shirt and the vaporous sky behind him, the equivalent in black and white of the famed colorism of Venetian art. -MBC 56</page><page sequence="17">FOGG ART MUSEUM GEORGE STUBBS English, 1724-1806 A Lion Devouring a Horse, 1788 Soft-ground etching and roulette, 24.8 x 33.3 cm (sheet) Alvin Whitley Acquisition Fund, M21089 Famous for his paintings of horses and hounds, George Stubbs was one of the artists whose work was most widely reproduced by contemporary engravers. This print, however, shows him to be an astute and original printmaker in his own right. Whereas the reproductive prints were meant for a large market, the technical sophistication evidenced in Stubbs's own prints makes it clear that he sought not only to extend his skills into other media but also to aim them specifically at a select group of print connoisseurs. Stubbs's dexterity as a printmaker is well dis- played in this plate, which shows his character- istic interest in the representation of textures. Through the use of a combination of the etch- ing needle and roulette (a tool with a serrated wheel that was rolled across the plate), the strength and orientation of the marks pro- duced match the density and texture of the objects described. For example, the lion's mane comprises deeply rolled marks that radi- ate from the animal's head, and whereas the foreground has been rendered with largely vertical marks to denote turf, light horizontal marks in the distance suggest the luminous sky. Iconographically, the "lion and horse" theme was a favorite of the artist; nearly twenty versions survive. As in earlier heraldic usage, both animals signaled their owner's authority, strength, and valor and typified man s command of nature. -BML * 57</page><page sequence="18">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN -VOL. 7, NO. 2 1t~~~~~~~~~~y~j 44 r,7 ~ ~ 4~ 58</page><page sequence="19">FOGG ART MUSEUM JAMES GILLRAY British, 1757-1815 Titianus Redivivus;-or-the Seven- Wise-Men Consulting the New Venetian Oracle,-a Scene in Ye Academic Grove, 1797 Etching, hand colored, 55 x 42 cm (plate) Purchase through the generosity of Julian and Hope Edison, M23386 As an institution underpinned by royal power during the 1790s, the decade of the French Revolution, the Royal Academy was ready fodder for James Gillray, a key figure in the history of British graphic satire. Gillray had studied at the Royal Academy schools but felt no compunction in savaging the institution after many of its members had endorsed the purported secret of Titian's coloring, which had been fraudulently "discovered" by a young woman and presented at the 1797 exhibition. She stands at the center of this stridently colored print, daubing at a monochromatic portrait of Titian, the whole a parody of conti- nental artistic conventions, specifically Vene- tian color. Below, the duped academicians- the "seven wise men"-sit as if in art school, in front of a throng of apelike painters clamoring for the secret. The affair made news as a major scandal, and a hand-colored etching was the ideal vehicle, as such a print could engage a broader audience through humor and an easily intelligible graphic shorthand. Evidently Gillray's satire, or the repudiation of academic hubris it repre- sented, had its intended effect: It engendered a slew of published recantations and, as a contemporary critic noted, there were no "Venetian" pictures to be seen at the 1798 exhibition. -BML WILLIAM BUTTERFIELD, DESIGNER English, 1814-1900 JOHN KEITH, MAKER English, active 1848-63 Chalice, 1849 Silver, h. 23.5 cm Paul Clarke Stauffer Fund, 1999.97 This silver chalice is an example of the Gothic Revival taste prevalent in mid-nineteenth- century England. Growing out of romantic nostalgia for the past, the Gothic Revival looked to medieval prototypes in architecture and decorative arts.

A dynamic tension is created between the smooth surfaces of the stepped foot and raised bowl and the deco- rated elements of engraved inscriptions, cast wavy rays, and pierced knop. An inscription under the base indicates that it was made for the Church of Saint John the Evangelist in Stratford, northeast London.

Evidently, he had already been at work on these for several weeks, for an entry dated 9 January mentions various mythological scenes that might be used to illustrate the seasons of the year. Although he worked on the commission for several years, it appears that it was never completed. The four full-sized panels are now in the collection of the Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo, Brazil. These large compositions are unfinished, and ques- tions remain as to whether they were modified by another artist close to Delacroix, perhaps his frequent collaborator, Pierre Andrieu. The four preparatory sketches mentioned in the journal remained in Delacroix's possession until his death; they were sold in the posthu- mous sale of February 1864. Until recently, scholars were unaware of the whereabouts of the Autumn panel now in the Fogg collec- tion. This painting was the gift of Virginia Herrick Deknatel in memory of her husband, Frederick Brockway Deknatel, for many years a professor of fine arts at Harvard University. -SBK CARL VON BLAAS Austrian, 1815-1894 The Miraculous Translation of the Body of Saint Catherine of Alexandria to Sinai, 186o Oil on canvas, 102.2 X 141 cm Melvin R. Seiden Purchase Fund, 1992.288 Born in the Tirol, Carl von Blaas trained in Venice and Munich before winning a stipend to study in Rome from 1837 until 1842. There von Blaas was influenced by the art of the Nazarene group. This movement's chief pro- ponents, Franz Pforr (1788-1812) and Johann Friedrich Overbeck (1789-1869), had left Vienna in 181o to settle in Rome, where they styled themselves as the Brotherhood of Saint Luke, with the intention of emulating early Renaissance painting styles and religious themes. After the early-fourth-century Saint Catherine's martyrdom by the imperial Romans in Alexandria, angels reputedly car- ried her body to a mountaintop in Sinai, close to where Moses had received the tablets of the Law.

Von Blaas first painted this subject in 1841, achieving immediate success when the painting was sold two days after it was first exhibited. -SBK HENRY PEACH ROBINSON British, 1830-190l Somebody Coming, i861 Albumen silver print (madefrom two negatives), 29.2 x 24.6 cm Richard and Ronay Menschel Fundfor the Acquisition of Photographs, P1997.46 Trained as a painter, Henry Peach Robinson became one of the progenitors of an impor- tant nineteenth-century movement that advanced the representation of the ideal and the picturesque in fine art photography. Taking root in the late 1850s in Britain and dominating the nascent photographic art scene until the i88os, this philosophy was championed by a group of artists that was closely allied with the Pre-Raphaelite move- ment that included Roger Fenton, William Lake Price, and Oscar Rejlander, with whom Robinson studied. These photographers promoted the notion that photography was not merely a handmaiden of the arts but a legitimate art form in its own right, to which the rules of artistic composition and the ideals of beauty should be intelligently applied. In one of his most influential aesthetic treatises, Pictorial Effect in Photography (1869), Robinson wrote: "I wish to show that it is the photographer's business to see; to do which he must learn to see, that by seeing he may =:~~~~- 4 appreciate, and that the power of artistic sight may be, as it were, artificially cultivated." Robinson practiced this conviction by employing preparatory sketches and com- bination printing techniques to make his compositions. Somebody Coming is a carefully choreographed exhibition print created from two negatives that have been scrupulously printed together to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. -DMK 63</page><page sequence="24">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 EDOUARD MANET French, 1832-1883 The Chair and the Shadow, from Le Corbeau, 1875 Lithograph, 54.8 x 34.8 cm (sheet) Gift of Albert H. Gordon, M22409 Combining Manet's illustrations with the poet Stephane Mallarme's French translation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven, Le Corbeau typifies the livre d'artiste-a limited-edition, luxury volume illustrated with original art- works. In it we can see Manet's modernistic bravura deriving from an intersection of . . .... . technical, stylistic, and literary influences. The technique used to reproduce Manet's illustra- tions was a complex and still not entirely understood transfer method that allowed the reproduction of the freshness and spontane- ous verve of brush and ink drawings. His designs were applied to the printing matrix using either transfer paper or transparent supports, which were transposed onto a litho- graphic matrix either by press pressure or a photographic process. The abstracted sketchiness enabled by the transfer process allowed Manet to endow his images with the corresponding terror evoked by the poet, who used symbolist-like intima- tions. This end-of-the-century aesthetic was characterized by one contemporary critic as "the spirit of the curious form." This particu- lar plate illustrates the final verse, in which the Raven "never flitting, still is sitting"; the shadow of the raven can be seen against the floor. Characteristic of his searching graphic experimentation of the 1870s, prints such as this exemplify Manet's unconstrained approach to printmaking, one whose pro- nounced unconventionality was to stimulate the next generation of more experimental peintre-graveurs (painter-engravers). -BML 64</page><page sequence="25">FOGG ART MUSEUM PAUL GAUGUIN _ French, 1848-1903 Man in a Toque, c. 1875/77 Oil on canvas, 46.7 x 38.4 cm Gift of Helen W Ellsworth in memory of Duncan S.

Until this time a "Sunday painter in 1876 he exhibited in the official Salon for the first time and began to contemplate seriously the possibility of earning a living by his art. He left one Paris brokerage firm for employ- ment at another, but the balance between salaried employment and art making had begun to shift. It would eventually culminate in his . | . . . total devotion to the latter. Gauguin's artistic influences were changing as well. The portrait is executed in the dark pal- ette of the Barbizon painters he emulated in his landscapes, in a style informed by Manet's blunt realism. It was at this time that Gauguin entered the circle of Camille Pissarro, who would become his informal teacher and his friend and through whom he became acquainted with the artists of the impression- ist movement. He began to collect their work almost immediately, but he did not exhibit with them until the fourth Impressionist Exhibition in 1879, and he would never fully assimilate impressionist principles into his artistic practice. -SBK 65</page><page sequence="26">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 R _ hA~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- .0s''f'n V i~~~~~~~~4~~~~~~~2) ~~ ~ (.I GEORGES PIERRE SEURAT French, 1859-1891 Hat, Clothes, and Shoes, 1883-84 Black chalk on off-white modern laid paper, 236 x 309 mm Gift of Lois Orswell, 1993.231 This drawing is a study for the apparel piled behind the seated youth in the center of Seurat's first major painting, his Bathers at Asnieres (1883-84, National Gallery, London). Refused by the Salon, the painting was shown at the Groupe des Artistes Independants in May 1884. Just before the production of the canvas, Seurat began to experiment with a type of drawing in which the use of line was avoided. Instead, he developed a technique whereby boundaries were established by the opposition of black conte crayon and the white of the paper. This juxtaposition created a pattern of abstracted shapes with little interior model- ing that were arranged in a planar manner across the sheet; a background was virtually absent. The tonal variety created by the greasy crayon-from gentle grays to lustrous blacks-along with the highly textured paper the artist preferred, generated dense surfaces and highly tactile forms. Seurat often exhibited these types of drawings. Their meticulous degree of finish suggests that for him, drawing was, at the very least, the equivalent of painting. -ALC 66</page><page sequence="27">FOGG ART MUSEUM HENRI DE TOULOUSE-LAUTREC French, 1864-190o Jane Avril at the Lithography Workshop, 1893 Lithograph, 56.2 x 65.2 cm (sheet) Collection of Anne Blake Smith, Donated by William and Sarah Freedberg, M23970 Toulouse-Lautrec produced this cover for the first L'Estampe originale, a portfolio of prints issued quarterly, during the so-called golden age of lithography, when new techniques of impression and reproduction appeared within the cultural context of Art Nouveau. A central tenet of Art Nouveau was the junction of the fine and applied arts, and this fine-art representation of the lithographer's craft exemplified the magazine's analogous mission to present the various print processes as viable means to original art. Lithography had only recently secured an equal place alongside the traditional techniques of engraving and etch- ing, and Toulouse-Lautrec was central to its ascendance.

The Fogg's print, for example, evidences Lautrec's translation of japoniste influences through a complex, idiosyncratic graphic tech- nique. The economy of detail and decor, the elliptical drawing, and the application of large areas of flat color-all derived from Japanese art-fit perfectly with the technical particu- larities of lithography. -BML HILAIRE-GERMAIN-EDGAR DEGAS French, 1834-1917 Untitled (Self-Portrait in Library), 1895 Gelatin silver print, 11.9 x i6.7 cm Richard and Ronay Menschel Fund for the Acquisition of Photographs, P1997.42 Much has been written about the seemingly photographic or "instantaneous" sensibility of Degas's art, exemplified by the fragmented compositions, "cropped" figures, and height- ened perspective systems that typify many of his paintings, prints, and drawings. Yet while Degas maintained a lifelong fascination with photography, it was not until the 189os that he began experimenting with making photo- graphs. Ironically, of the more than sixty extant photographs attributed to Degas, most are highly staged portraits and self-portraits made in intimate domestic interiors, using long exposure times and artificial lights- exactly the opposite of photographic "instan- taneity." As described in the journals of family friend Daniel Halevy, Degas carefully arranged his portraits, adjusting the composition, props, and lights in a determined frenzy. The artist's nocturnal photographic adven- tures resulted in maverick images such as this mannered self-portrait in which the figure is distorted both by its proximity to the camera's lens and by the long exposure time. Here Degas's brilliantly illuminated face and hand appear to emerge from the picture plane, while his shoulders seem to dissolve into the murky shadows of the library in the background. The consummate innovator, Degas created some of the most original photographic portraits of his era. -DMK . .I .. g . .. .....................

In the black- and-white lithographic basis of the image, the invalid, prayed for by her father and com- forted by her aunt, is isolated from her griev- ing siblings at the left. In this hand-colored impression, looping shadows of deep-blue wash connect Sophie's wicker chair with her deathbed, and the room becomes claustropho- bic from the pressure of the warm-hued floor. Munch passed the bluish white wash that colors the walls over the black dresses of his sisters in the foreground; the watery solution has beaded up like tears on the oily layer of printer's ink. On the bed, a heavier application of reddish pigment has coagulated like blood. Such an emotive manipulation of drawing media and, in many other prints, of graphic techniques was typical of Munch's constant exploration, one impression at a time, of the expressive potential of his basic compositional structures. -MBC lqw ~ ~ ~ (F *to,: 69</page><page sequence="30">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 ROBERT DEMACHY French, 1859-1936 Symbolist Study, c. 1goo-lo Gum bichromate print, i6.o x 21.5 cm Richard and Ronay Menschel Fund for the Acquisition of Photographs, P1997.2 Born to a prominent Parisian banking family, Robert Demachy enjoyed a life of culture, education, and leisure. Beginning in the i88os, he developed a keen interest in photography, following closely the theoretical and practical developments of pictorialism as established by Peter Henry Emerson and his followers in England and the United States. Photographers working in the pictorialist style emphasized the medium's creative potential as rivaling that of other art forms. Over the succeeding two decades, Demachy became the most celebrated art photographer in France, exhibiting internationally and publishing hundreds of articles on the aes- thetics and practice of fine art photography. An advocate of photographic manipulation, he was responsible for the rediscovery and invigoration of the gum and oil pigment printing processes widely used by the pictorialists from the 189os through the ilios. Emphasizing the artist's control of both com- position and process, Demachy's photographs are imbued with aesthetic qualities frequently associated with the impressionist and symbol- ist movements. Such elements are evident in Symbolist Study, which presents an image of burgeoning self-awareness in the depiction of an adolescent girl who emerges from a densely forested landscape. One of Demachy's most sophisticated pigment prints, its success depends as much on the complicated gum printing technique as on the composition and exposure of the photograph. -DMK 70</page><page sequence="31">FOGG ART MUSEUM EDWARD STEICHEN American, 1879-1973 Dana Steichen, 1923 Palladium print, 35.6 X 26 cm Gift of Joanna T. Steichen, P1991.4 As a founding member of the Photo Secession, the American organ of the pictorialist movement estab- lished in 1902, Edward Steichen promoted the use of photography as an interpretive medium. He created evocative images influenced by the mysteries of the twilight hour, which fascinated him. Yet in his later advertising and celebrity photographs of the 1920S and 1930s, Steichen rejected the aesthetic principles of pictorialism in favor of sharp focus and dramatic com- position, elements he continued to employ throughout the remainder of his career. This exquisite 1923 palladium print of his second wife, Dana, is repre- sentative of the transition between these two approaches to the medium. Steichen met Dana Desboro Glover, an actress and aspiring photographer, in 1921 at the New York School of Photography. The two were married in 1923. Dana's vibrancy, grace, and sense of humor are revealed in this tightly framed and softly focused portrait. She playfully responds to Steichen's direction, suggesting the intimacy of their relationship. Steichen further augments the sensuality of her pose by realizing the print in the expansive, warm tones of the palladium process. -ML .. ... .. ... 71</page><page sequence="32">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2  OSKAR NERLINGER German, 1893-1969 Juno, 1928 Gelatin silver print (photogram) and gouache, 40.0 x 30.0 cm Richard and Ronay Menschel Fund for the Acquisition of Photographs, P1999.18 A painter, graphic artist, and photographer, Oskar Nerlinger was a central participant in many of the modern art movements that developed in Berlin between the wars. In 1921 he joined the expressionist group "Der Sturm," only to break with it three years later to become a leading member of the 72</page><page sequence="33">FOGG ART MUSEUM constructivist-inspired "Die Abstrakten." During this time Nerlinger made his first photographs, photomontages, and the experi- mental photograms (cameraless photographs made by placing objects directly onto sheets of photographic film or paper and exposing them to light) for which he is best known. Creating works of pure abstraction, radical political satire, and commercial design, by 1930 Nerlinger was supporting himself as a photographer and exhibiting his work in international exhibitions of the so-called New Vision movement. An exemplary image in the artist's oeuvre, Juno illustrates how he applied the vocabulary of modernism to the commercial design of a cigarette advertisement. Here Nerlinger creates a dynamic, abstract composition by cutting a photogram he had made of an arrangement of cigarettes into an L-shaped form and affixing it to a sheet of white paper. He then lettered the brand name "Juno" in blue and drew a spiral in red gouache over the image, as if abstracting rings of smoke. This striking work illustrates the confluence of avant-garde and commercial practice-a phenomenon of particular interest for artists and critics of Nerlinger's time, from La'szlo Moholy-Nagy to Walter Benjamin.

As early as the 193os, he was 140~~~ js E 73</page><page sequence="34">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 experimenting regularly with photography, originating new techniques and using it in conjunction with his work in other media. He produced a range of pictures, including photo- grams, documentary photographs, and images of his own sculptural constructions. Some of Smith's most interesting experiments were the negatives he made from sheets of colored transparent film and pieces of negatives that he pasted together and on which he drew with black ink and gouache. In the print and related negative reproduced here, Smith explored shape and line, playing abstract and real forms off one another. Such highly manipulated prints and negatives were unlike anything found in American photogra- phy at the time; indeed, avant-garde European trends, including surrealist biomorphic forms and cubist techniques like collage, greatly influenced Smith's photographic practices. Even though he abandoned these methods by the mid-i930s, the photographic medium continued to play an integral role in his artistry. He persistently photographed his own sculpture in the natural world and his studio, and arguably his experimentation with shape and line in photographic collage went on to inform his sculpture, for which he is best known. The Fogg Art Museum is proud to house the largest public collection of David Smith's work, including sculptures, paintings, draw- ings, and his truly unique photographs. -Jw  DORA MAAR (HENRIETTA THE1ODORA MARKOVITCH) French, 1907-1997 Untitled (Lee Miller), c. 1933 Gelatin silver print, 24 x 18.3 cm Richard and Ronay Menschel Fund for the Acquisition of Photographs, P1997.3 In the early 1930S the painter Dora Maar, who photographed Pablo Picasso's Guernica and who was the muse for his Weeping Woman series, began making photographs in the French surrealist tradition. In her extraordi- nary portrait of the American photographer Lee Miller, a simple but elegant double expo- sure dramatically depicts a statuesque Miller as if she were a sculptured bust. Inverting the Pygmalion myth of stone turned to flesh, Maar's treatment of the female body diverges from the often grotesque deformities pre- sented by her male surrealist counterparts. Here Miller's form, although objectified, is adulated as a powerful icon of femininity. 74</page><page sequence="35">FOGG ART MUSEUM Indeed, even though Miller modeled in the fashion industry and for photographers Edward Steichen and George Hoynigen- Huene, she was a sophisticated photographer in her own right, and her work was exhibited at such places as the Julien Levy Gallery, which opened in New York City around the time this image was taken. Miller's own photo- graphs, like Maar's, presented alternative visions of femininity. Maar's portrait of Lee Miller, the first surrealist photograph by a woman to enter the collec- tion, forms an excellent counterpart to the work of her colleagues represented at the Art Museums. -Jw THEODORE ROSZAK American, 1907-1981 Untitled, 1937-41 Gelatin silver print, 12.2 X 9.9 cm Richard Norton Memorial Fund, P1995.22 P p No other American artist of the 1930S was more closely allied with the constructivist belief in progressive technology than Theodore Roszak. In the early 1930S he spent an extended period of time in Europe, where he imbibed the ideas set forth in the work of artists such as Naum Gabo and La'szlo Moholy-Nagy. By the mid-thirties Roszak had begun to experiment with making photograms; at the same time, he was producing the innovative machine-inspired sculpture, painting, and drawing for which he is best known. Although Roszak never exhibited his photo- grams, he used them as an important aspect of the curricula he developed for the WPA- funded Laboratory School of Industrial Design in New York City. An experimental school founded on the principles developed at the Bauhaus, it promoted a program of study based on the belief that good design could better social conditions. Roszak's complex and nuanced photograms, in which forms and planes appear to intersect and to hover or move in indeterminate space, are among the most successful to be created by either European or American artists. The diaphanous figure-eight at the center of this Untitled photogram represents the "bipolar" form that also dominated many of the artist's other works of this period. For Roszak it stood as a visual analogy for the force of opposites act- ing on one another, a concept that formed the basis of his ideology. -DMK 75</page><page sequence="36">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 13 s: ALEXANDER CALDER American, 1898-1976 OctOPus, 1947 Bronze, 43.2 x 20.3 cm (max. diam.)

Orswell was a fiercely independent collector who bought what she liked without relying on advisors. She voiced unorthodox opinions- Braque's superiority to Picasso, Kline's to Pollock, and when it came to critics, Henry McBride's to Clement Greenberg-without apology. She discovered the abstract expres- sionists at their first exhibitions in New York in the late 1940S and became especially close to the leading sculptor of the group, David Smith. Her 1994 gift of forty-three works by Smith made the Museums the world's largest public repository of his work. Modern sculpture particularly captivated Orswell, as her letters to Cohn attest. In one such letter, Orswell revealed her belief that "sculpture is really nothing but light and shadow" or "carved space and matter" and that "a good sculpture must not touch the ground." The works by Moore and Calder reproduced here embody those values perfectly, as do important sculptures by Giacometti, Brancusi, Lachaise, and others among the Orswell donations.

Carefully composing the painting to appear as if it were a casual view glimpsed by a passerby, he bisects the picture plane with a vertical pilaster. The placement of this element creates an internal diptych, which isolates the figures from one another. The two men on the left are framed by a doorjamb, while a reflected view of a street scene in a plate-glass window is seen behind the man on the right. For Shahn, the specificity of the figures' ethnicity within the urban setting was essen- tial to the meaning of the work. In a letter he wrote to Julien Levy in anticipation of his important 1940 one-man show, Shahn described the painting as depicting a "Greek," "Greek American," and "Negro-American." Shahn's depiction of both new and assimilated 77</page><page sequence="38">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 immigrants and varied racial groups as iso- lated from one another but living and working in close quarters reflected the actual culture of the Lower East Side.

The voluptuous forms-both bodily and vegetal- and bracing colors create an image of overwhelming fecundity and animation. Seedpodlike elements expel colorful vapor into the atmosphere, and the elements seem to gently undulate, nod, and wheeze. This is an invented landscape drawn from physical and emotional experience; at the time, Gorky was freshly rejuvenated by a new marriage and repeated visits to the country. -MS 78</page><page sequence="39">FOGG ART MUSEUM RALSTON CRAWFORD American, 1906-1978 Third Avenue El, 1949 Gelatin silver print, 7.8 x 11.4 cm Richard Norton Memorial Fund, Kenyon C. Bolton III Fund, Kate, Maurice R. and Melvin R. Seiden Purchase Fund for Photographs, P1996.10 In the late 1930S Ralston Crawford, known primarily as a painter and lithographer, began using a camera. He photographed street scenes and elements of vernacular American architec- ture, including factories, docks, and bridges. The camera initially served as a sort of "sketch pad" for Crawford, who, like Charles Sheeler, translated many of his photographs nearly verbatim into painted form. But as he mas- tered the subtleties of photographic technique, this medium became a tool through which he could extend his vision. The camera allowed him to create multiple images from various perspectives. In making photographic series, Crawford accumulated material from which he would work throughout his career. Third Avenue El, which Crawford used to illustrate his 1949 article for Modern Photogra- phy, exemplifies his work. Here delicate light patterns contrast with the El's bold, dramatic forms, imbuing one of the city's noisiest elements with a quiet, lyrical ease. For a related lithograph (also in the collection of the Fogg) and painting, Crawford further simplified the forms and flattened the space, thus exaggerating the abstract geometry depicted in the original photograph. Images such as Third Avenue El and the corresponding lithograph provide excellent opportunities to instruct students in the unique working practices of modern American artists like Ralston Crawford. -Jw WILLEM DE KOONING American, 1904-1997 Two Nude Figures, 1950 Graphite with touches of crayon on heavy cream wove paper, 484 x 561 mm Gift of Lois Orswell, 1996.25 This monumental drawing, which remained unpublished until 1999, is an unusual interruption in de Kooning's sustained ;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.. . . ..... z .. . . .i.... e....,...6'..a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~..... ............ .. ... . iE.. ,I S .. .. ..4J'.4. - - 1|!11 1| I . 79</page><page sequence="40">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 investigations into the female figure in the early 1950s, culminating in Woman I (1950-52, Museum of Modern Art, New York).

One thinks of Callot's ranked, indifferent troops surrounding a tree full of hanged men, and of Goya's soldiers mercilessly sabering their living captive in half. Even the Goya and George Grosz etchings that show only the human detritus that remained usually identify the circumstances as war by the debris: blasted guns, uniforms, and fortifications. Aerial bombing removed aggressors from con- tact with victims. The killers were depersonal- ized, although the casualties, even multiplied into the millions, were not when symbolized by individuals in works of art and literature. Who can forget the calamitous, invisible vio- lence personalized by John Hersey's descrip- tion in Hiroshima of the survivors whose eyes had melted from their sockets when they looked up at the flash of the atomic bomb? In 1952 the United States tested its first hydrogen bomb; the Soviet Union followed in 1953. One year later, Baskin embodied the universal dread by the absence of the weapon. All that remains is the corroded victim, still standing at full human stature, a last witness to his own death. -MBC 8o</page><page sequence="41">FOGG ART MUSEUM 41- ~ ~ ~ I- JACOB LAWRENCE American, b. 1917 Struggle: From the History of the American People: No. 15, Creation, 1955 Tempera on gessoed hardboard, 29.2 x 39.4 cm Anonymous Fund in memory of Henry Berg, Henry George Berg Bequest, Richard Norton Memorial, and Alpheus Hyatt Purchasing Funds, 1995.23 EVA HESSE American, 1936-1970 Untitled, 1966 Gray wash and graphite on cream wove paper, 350 x 274 mm Alpheus Hyatt Purchasing Fund and Margaret Fisher Fund, 1994.64 ? The Estate of Eva Hesse, Courtesy Robert Miller Gallery, New York In sculptures assembled from washers and grommets or wound cords, as well as in draw- ings such as the Fogg's, the modular circle was a signature motif in Hesse's work of the middle 196os. This sheet is one of several simi- lar drawings dating to 1966-67 that feature monochromatic circles inscribed within a grid of graphite squares. Some of the squares are simply filled with gray wash, others bear only a circular outline, while still others contain three or four concentric circles shaded with gray washes of varying strengths. When filling in the grid with wash, Hesse left as a reserve vertical lines that bisect each square. This irregular strip of exposed white paper, the delicacy of the superimposed layers of wash, and the asymmetries in the design invest Hesse's work with a deeply personal touch and exquisitely crafted appearance that distinguish her work from the mechanical execution and formal geometries of the minimalists, who were her closest associates. -WWR . .. 4 ; l 61, o . . .. ... .. , a.. . w .. .... . :X . .. . . 8i</page><page sequence="42">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 EDWARD RUSCHA American, b. 1937 Ruscha books (group shot) Margaret Fisher Fund, M24187-M24204 Royal Road Test, 1967 Offset photolithograph, 24 x 16 cm (cover) Margaret Fisher Fund, M24200 Every Building on the Sunset Strip, 1966 Offset photolithograph, i8.1 X 14.2 cm (cover) Margaret Fisher Fund, M24192 VARIOUS A SMALL I ~ r qXhI. nRs s n iCRACKERS ROAD TEST 17 WAYU T WENTYSU X SWEUGGASOLINE ..wt. ... 1 .TATIONS ,? tg In the mid-i96os, "Ed-Werd Rew-Shay Young Artist" (as he styled himself) transformed the livre d'artiste into the artist's book.

Lichtenstein continued to use his device of enlarged Benday dots, the signature pattern of cheap reproductions, but he began to assimi- late it with plastic surfaces that were mechani- cally tooled to refract light-parodies of the variable luminescence of changing natural skies. With a few of his landscape paintings, he took the further step of motorizing them to activate their radiant surfaces, so that they constantly shifted relative to the light. With a small, easily handled print such as this, how- ever, he could rely on the viewer to shift its position to obtain the same dazzle. 83</page><page sequence="44">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 After publishing a few individual landscape prints from 1964 through 1966, usually as contributions to multi-artist portfolios, in 1967 Lichtenstein issued as a set ten variations on the landscape theme. It was a grand climax; the same year, he abandoned landscapes of his own composition and embarked on his Benday-dotted versions of that icon of serial luminous landscape, Monet's haystacks. -MBC ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG American, b. 1925 Booster, 1967 Lithograph and screen print, 182.6 X 90 cm (design) Margaret Fisher Fund, M22001 In 1967 Gemini, a West Coast print studio at the forefront of the American lithographic renaissance, published Booster. It was immedi- ately apparent that graphic art had challenged contemporary painting on its own grounds of scale, complexity of medium, and, above all, defiance of convention. The print was the largest fine-art lithograph yet made. Its most dramatic feature is its one-to-one scale with reality, manifest in the actual-size reproduc- tion of a full-body X-ray of the artist, achieved through photo-transfer. The chart of the movement of the sun through the sky for the year 1967, superimposed in screen printing, itself a twentieth-century invention, relates this man, as revealed by his very bones, to the scale of the cosmos. How different is the heroic aspiration of this identifiable individual from the horror of universal human tragedy embodied in the blasted frame of Baskin's Hydrogen Man (see p. 80), executed by hand only thirteen years earlier in woodcut, the oldest print process. Rauschenberg would go on to identify with the cosmos even more ambitiously in his Stoned Moon lithographs, realized at Gemini but initiated at Cape Canaveral, which made explicit the implications of Booster's very title: the triumph of humans over space through modern technology. -MBC 84</page><page sequence="45">FOGG ART MUSEUM DAVID RABINOWITCH Canadian, b. 1945 Romanesque Abutment, III, 1968 Solid hot-rolled steel, 45.8 x 36.8 x 15.3 cm Gift of the Artist, 1998.227 BARNETT NEWMAN American, 19o5-i97o Untitled Etching #1, 1969 Etching, 37.7 x 60.4 cm (plate) Gift of Annalee Newman, M20186 The artist's widow has given Harvard not only all of Barnett Newman's published prints but also a number of proof impressions.

London, M.D., Class of 1957, 1997.210 Romare Bearden drew inspiration from Euro- pean and African artistic traditions, jazz, lit- erature, folklore, and religion. He began in the 1930S as a political cartoonist and illustrator, studying with George Grosz. Later he moved toward abstraction and French modernism, working with Stuart Davis. In 1963 he joined the Spiral Group, a collective concerned with the position of black artists in the civil rights movement and American culture. ORE p _ 1i - jsi As the cover of the New York Times Magazine of 20 April 1969, this col- lage illustrated an essay by the histo- rian C. Vann Woodward on the state of black studies. The composition traces the path of black people from Africa (the sculpted head at right) to urban America (the streets of New York at left) via the incubator of African-American culture, the rural South. Inversions such as the back- wards flag and the right-to-left narrative flow suggest trepidation over this passage. In an eloquent expression of mixed emotions, the boy at left confronts us with a look of wary interest. By reconfiguring mass media images and arranging them with flat areas of color, Bearden creates a poly- rhythmic texture. His use of collage can be seen as a metaphor for the fractured reality of urban life and the black experience. Yet his own 86</page><page sequence="47">FOGG ART MUSEUM interpretation was more positive: "Assemblage forges a variety of images into one unified expression." In 1969 the writer Ralph Ellison said of Bearden, "Through his art he seeks to reset society's clock by imposing upon it his own method of defining the times." -SK RICHARD TUTTLE American, b. 1941 Stick and Paint, 1970-80 Wood dowel, 24 x 1.2 X 23 cm White Rocker, 1970-80 Wood painted white, 7.5 x 12.5 x 2.5 cm Swept One, 1970-80 Galvanized metal, io x 23 x 2.5 cm Purchase through the generosity of Barbara Lee and the Frances F. and John Bowes Fund, 1998.119, 117, ii8 In the spring of 1996, Richard Tuttle moved out of his longtime studio, prompting a review of everything he had made over a thirty-year period. "Things left long ago in corners and forgotten," he said, "had to be dealt with anew." Among the things Tuttle submitted to review was a box of small sculp- tures, which he promptly titled "Small Sculp- tures of the 70's," referring to their creation dates. Stick and Paint, White Rocker, and Swept One are three of these. Aside from their indisputable smallness-their dimensions range from less than 2 to no more than 24 cm-the thirty-six sculptures in this group remain almost obstinately distinct. In Tuttle's words, they "function as a group with- out actually being either a series or a sequence, meaning they exist equally, in no particular order and toward no specific end." Like most of Tuttle's work, each object elaborates a unique and deceptively banal proposition, partially reiterated in its title. Stick and Paint is in fact a short length of cut-and-glued dowel with a bit of ice-blue paint, but it is also a prop that appears to hold apart the wall and floor it sits between. White Rocker describes three pieces of wood painted white and joined to form a semicircular shape that rocks, but the sculpture has an uncanny anthropomorphic quality that may owe to Tuttle's basing it on a famous fragment of an Egyptian stone head. The association is so subtle as to be felt, rather than observed, and is typical of the artist's play with phenomenological effect and his ability to make objects that defy scale. Tuttle speaks of these sculptures as taking place "within the space of a book' an explanation that, charac- teristicahly, speaks volumes. -LN 87</page><page sequence="48">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 ELLSWORTH KELLY American, b. 1923 Curve X, 1974 Steel, 304.8 x 5o.8 x 1.9 cm Gift of the Artist in memory of Joseph Pulitzer, Jr., 1993.214 Ellsworth Kelly is distinguished among the great painters of the postwar era for his com- mitment to sculpture as an integral part of the creative process.

Since then, Kelly has continued to explore the abstract power of the flat, shaped monochrome surface in his sculp- tures and paintings. Curve X is part of an extensive series of Stand- ing Totem Curves that Kelly began in 1974 using aluminum, steel, and wood. The artist had the weathering steel of Curve X sandblasted some years after its original fabri- cation to create a smooth, quietly glowing surface that shows the beautiful gray of the steel itself. As the tall form tapers and swells, the play of light creates a singular pictorial experience. And yet, given the confrontational presence of this sentinel, the experience is one of sculpture above all. Kelly's gift honors Joseph Pulitzer, Jr. (Class of 1936), the renowned collector of modern art and longtime friend and patron of the Museums and the Depart- ment of Fine Arts until his death in 1993. This is the second sculpture Kelly has given to Harvard: His Two Curves: Blue Red (1964), a monumental painted alumi- num sculpture previously installed at the 1964 New York World's Fair, graces the courtyard of Peabody Terrace near the Charles River. -HC 88</page><page sequence="49">FOGG ART MUSEUM H. C. WESTERMANN American, 1922-1982 Arctic Death Ship, from The Connecticut Ballroom, 1976 Woodcut, 45.5 x 6o.7 cm (design) Margaret Fisher Fund, M24066 The Death Ship in various guises is a constant in the sculpture and graphic work of Westermann, and no wonder: He was a sailor and marine in World War II and the Korean conflict. He faced kamikaze attacks, and years later he could still visualize "actually seeing death coming at you right down your fucking gun barrel." Throughout his life as a professional artist, Westermann retained the outsider's perspective: He had been a tattooed wanderer from port to port and then an acrobat before he attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. This print and the others in the portfolio are imbued with his sense of identification with outcasts, human and animal; with distant, hostile shores and climes; with the graphism of the untutored. The woodcuts are executed with consummate skill by the artist himself, with no parceling out of the process to assistants or print technicians. Westermann was, and remains, famous for his sensibility toward his materials. -i-a He was a superb carpenter, whose sculptures are combinations of exquisitely crafted wood and found objects. A notable early example is his Walnut Box, made from walnut wood, inlaid in walnut with its name, and filled with-walnuts. The prints are no less well crafted and no less filled with Westermann's unique sensibility toward the world. -MBC TONY SMITH American, 1912-1980 Study for "Throwback," 1976-79 Black-painted steel, 44.5 x 76.2 x 58.4 cm Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles M.

In 1975, shortly after Nixon first seriously began using an eight-by- ten view camera, he photographed his wife and her three sisters, inaugurating an annual tradition that continues to this day. With the second picture, in 1976, in collaboration with his four subjects, Nixon decided on the format of the portrait. Only one picture would be released each year, regardless of how many negatives were exposed. The four women, who always appear in the same order, look directly at the camera. Despite this systematic structure, the images picture with elegance and psy- chological acuity the ever-fluctuating ebb and flow of family relations, aging, and identity. In this series of portraits, considered a tour de force of contem- porary photography, Nixon transforms the casual snapshot into a highly mediated form in which every picture alludes to the year of experience that separates it from the year before. The Fogg is honored to be one of only three public institutions to own a complete set, augmented each year, of The Brown Sisters. -Jw 9o</page><page sequence="51">FOGG ART MUSEUM JASPER JOHNS American, b. i930 Hatching (Front Endpaper), 1978 Aquatint and drypoint, 58.5 x 92.7 cm (plate) Margaret Fisher Fund, and Gift of Paul Cornwall-Jones in honor of James Cuno, in his undertaking of the exhibition Foirades/Fizzles: Echo and Allusion in the Art of Jasper Johns, 1987, M23424 Published by Petersburg Press in 1976, Foirades/Fizzles comprises five short prose texts by the Irish- born writer Samuel Beckett and thirty-three etchings by Jasper Johns. The texts are consistent with Beckett's preoccupation with dense and darkly humorous first- person narratives and are part of a series of texts written between 1960 and 1974. Johns's etchings derive from the imagery of his painting Untitled (1972), now in the collection of the Ludwig Museum, Cologne. ;4 II/~ SW '~ ~ v- Since the late nineteenth century, it has been conventional to cancel the plate of a print after the edition was published. The design is X'ed through or otherwise disfigured so that the prospective market can be assured of the edition's limitation. But Johns's ruminative habit of returning over and over to the same motifs has led him to reserve and reuse his plates. Two years after the 1976 publication of Foirades/Fizzles, instead of simply rendering the plates unusable, Johns reconfigured them by ganging them up into new compositions. For Hatching he printed as an array the four plates that had been printed one over the other to create the colored endpapers of Foirades/Fizzles, transforming them into his iconic American flag composition. The most deeply bitten plate prints darkest and stands for the flag's field of stars, but originally it had been printed in white ink, an irony doubtless not lost on Johns when he carefully labeled each plate with its original color as part of the cancellation scheme. The most lightly bitten plate-"Green" (now gray)-prints so pale it seems but a retinal afterimage. -MBC 91</page><page sequence="52">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 .. ...... @ i . . -. c BS8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. .. 1 . . :. , ......... . ... . NAN GOLDIN American, b. 1953 Self-Portrait in Blue Bathroom, London, 1980 Cibachrome, 73.6 x ioi.6 cm Gift of Nan Goldin in memory of Jeffrey Weinberger, P1994.1 This photograph is drawn from an extensive body of highly autobiographical work titled The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, through which Nan Goldin has challenged traditional attitudes about gender, sexuality, and identity in contemporary culture. She does this by situ- ating the viewer in the middle of the cluttered bedrooms, bathrooms, and bars where she and her subculture "family"-the drag queens, transvestites, and drug users who form her inner circle-experience moments of inti- macy, eroticism, violence, and despair. Goldin uses her camera to create a visual diary of her irreconcilable desire for both dependency and autonomy, and her struggle against what she disparagingly calls the "mythology of romance." In the original format of her work, Goldin performs the Ballad as a type of "cinema," in which hundreds of images are projected in rapid succession, choreographed to an eclectic musical score. In a body of work as emotion- ally raw as this, the self-portrait, in which Goldin pictures herself as an ephemeral reflec- tion in a tiny bathroom mirror, seems mark- edly remote. Alone and diminished, the artist appears to dematerialize as striations of light rake across her face. Goldin's skewed vantage point, her reference to the mirror as an inter- nal framing device, and her symbolic use of blue, reinforce a palpable sense of isolation- qualities enhanced by the scale of this exhibi- tion print. -DMK 92</page><page sequence="53">FOGG ART MUSEUM AGNES MARTIN American, b. 1912 Untitled #4,1991 Acrylic and graphite on canvas, 183.5 x 183.5 cm Gift of the American Art Foundation, 1995.42 When asked how she makes her paintings, Agnes Martin answers: I say to my mind, "What am I going to paint next?" Then I wait for the inspiration. The painting comes into my mind, and I can see it. You have to wait if you're going to be inspired. You have to clear out your mind, to have a quiet and empty mind. The appreciation of Martin's nonobjective paintings requires a similar approach. Give her work enough time and it will reveal a distinct light, an emotional pitch, and a rhythmic pulse that are unique to each painting. Martin's paintings conflate the hard edge and repetitive elements of minimalism with a subtle painterly touch. Untitled #4 consists of alternating horizontal bands and thin graphite lines that cover the canvas. From a distance, the bands and lines appear to divide the square canvas into equal rectangles, while up close the subtle variations and textural differ- ences of each mark become visible. The graph- ite lines, which stop short before the edges of the canvas, respond to and trace the ever-so- slight texture of the painting's gessoed surface. Martin believes that these subtle differences make possible the communication of beauty and joy, which, according to her, "is the subject matter of art." -JVR i i I , .

In the series of twenty-four paintings entitled AIR: 24 Hours (published in the book of that name), these overtones become dominant, resulting in an important fusion of minimalist structure and "New Image" associative imagery. Neverthe- less, Bartlett retains the grid as the structural component; the representational elements she introduces in this series, as seen here in Seven P.M., both reinforce and undermine the grid. The marking of time-recorded in the title, indicated by the clock, and abstracted by the two interior grids, each representing minutes and seconds-is characteristic of the artist's earlier work. Bartlett's AIR: 24 Hours also introduces a new and unprecedented element: a complex act of double voy- eurism. Nothing in Seven P.M. has been placed haphazardly, and everything is monumen- tal in size and feeling. Thus, ordinary objects-nail polish, sweaters, shoes, a child's drawing, and other dressing-room accessories- cease to be familiar. Instead, they become catalytic and magical objects that repre- sent an absentee: Bartlett herself. The viewer becomes a voyeur peering into a women's dressing room that has been tempo- rarily vacated. In each painting of the series, the viewer wanders through the artist's day- every hour in a different room-observing each staged scene. The viewer constantly seeks the absentee, who never appears but whose presence is always felt, as if she is looking back through the objects and spaces of her environ- ment. This reciprocal voyeurism seems basic to the experience of Bartlett's recent work, of which Seven PM. is one of the finest examples. -JVR 94</page><page sequence="55">FOGG ART MUSEUM KIKI SMITH American, b. 1954 Pee Body, 1992 Wax and glass beads (23 strands of varying lengths, 0.3 m to almost s m long); 68.6 x 71.1 x 71.1 cm Promised Gift in part of Barbara Lee and Emily Rauh Pulitzer and purchase in partfrom the Joseph A. Baird, Jr., Francis H. Burr Memorial, and Director's Acquisition Funds, 1997.82 Historically, the Fogg Art Museum has offered a contemplative space more akin to that of a cathedral than a white cube, an aesthetic environment intended to provoke reflection, not confrontation. As such, the Fogg's 1997 purchase of Pee Body, in conjunction with its decision to establish curatorial positions in modern and contemporary art, has almost symbolic significance. Most of us know the art of Kiki Smith best by description. Discussions of Smith's art have consistently focused on her use of the female body as "domain"; as the vehicle through which she can reclaim her "being here" and her "turf"; even as site for a debate on the humane. But Smith's work is highly sensitive to context. She borrows selectively from art historical and mythological traditions. Given .&lt;S:gerl*C&lt;.s.| ......

In Pee Body, the squeezing and pummeling through which Smith transforms pliable wax into palpable woman remain visible, as does the crudely applied toenail polish, and we feel the strong, rough touch when we look at her. More disconcertingly, the delicate yellow beads that stream out from behind and under the squatting figure, though discreetly abstract, touch off interior sensations. Pee Body is a sur- prisingly complex figure, poignantly graceful when viewed from the front, unapologetically base when viewed from behind, despite the pretty beads. Curiously, it is also a sculpture that operates most effectively in a space as hallowed and resonant as the Fogg. -LN GARY SCHNEIDER American, b. 1954 Meditations, 1993 Gelatin silver prints, each 93.2 x 75.8 cm Davis Pratt Fund, Richard and Ronay Menschel Fund for the Acquisition of Photographs, P1997.5.1-4 Over the past decade, Gary Schneider has stretched the boundaries of portraiture in a remarkably diverse series of projects that traverse the photographic medium. In com- plex images that seduce the viewer with their luminescent surfaces, Schneider enlists the photographic process-from its chemistry and materials to explorations of light and time-as the linchpin of his work. Schneider's Meditations is a unique installation of four enlarged handprints, which stand as the artist's self-portrait. He created this work by placing his wet hand on an 8 x io-inch piece of sheet film; the excess water and chemicals in the artist's perspiration interacted with the film, which was simultaneously "flashed" with light in the manner of a photogram. The nega- tive was then developed, printed in enlarged form, and toned. The incredibly layered and graphic prints made from these cameraless negatives appear to render substance but in fact are only a photographic trace of the hand's chemistry conjured through darkroom alchemy. At first glance, Schneider's handprints seem to exactly duplicate one another, but each is unique, printed and toned somewhat differently in order to create subtle relationships between the images' varying responses in the viewer. Through Meditations, Schneider questions traditional notions of identity in photographic representation. -DMK 96</page><page sequence="57">FOGG ART MUSEUM , .:. .; ; .; : -.; F. &amp;*- ) 97</page><page sequence="58">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 BRICE MARDEN American, b. 1938 Summer Group Extension, 1994 Black ink and white gouache on beige-gray textured wove paper; each drawing 248 x 197mm Louise Haskell Daly Fund and Margaret Fisher Fund, 1994.159.1-3 (1A, B illustrated) Summer Group Extension comprises six drawings in three frames. In other works like this, such as the Cold Mountain series of the late 198os and early 199os, Marden refers to Chinese calligraphy and poetry; the measured intervals between the pairs and the larger group allow dynamic interchange reminiscent of poetic verses. The drawings find their origin in Marden's habitual use of "work books" in which he explores sequential relationships in a disciplined, rather than informal, practice. The juddering, often scratchy, lines were applied at a distance with a long twig dipped in ink, which interacts uneasily with the heavily textured paper. The artist loosely traced some of the wet black lines with white gouache, imbuing the drawings with spectral trails; the web of strokes achieves a subtle layering. Summer Group Extension was purchased, in part, with the Margaret Fisher Fund, a generous bequest that has allowed the Fogg to acquire over 150 drawings dating from 1960 to the present. -MS IN ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~, .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .... ..........~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~r- 98</page><page sequence="59">FOGG ART MUSEUM LESLEY DILL American, b. 1950 Throat, from A Word Made Flesh ...

Read in full, a poem by Emily Dickinson often gives its reader pause because of its involuted or elliptical syntax and its unconventional punctuation. Yet a single line or couplet in its perfection often evokes the spirit of the whole, of not only the poem but also the poet. Brief, specific, yet elusive, the excerpts form lapidary epigrams, most recently acknowl- edged as such on the World Wide Web (Emily Dickinson Random Epigram Machine, http://www. logopoeia.com/ed/) and in the artworks of Lesley Dill. Dill inscribes Dickinson's verse, often ren- dered only partially, as here, on images of the human body or the body's clothing. The artist uses Japanese paper, fabric- or skinlike in its translucency and its accommodating drape; she then sews the elements of her works together, a feminine touch that subtly alludes to the gender of artist and poet alike.

Kramarsky, 1996.131 This is one of eleven drawings in the Weight and Measure series, executed by Serra in 1993 and 1994. This project originated in 1992 with the installation at the Tate Gallery of two large blocks of solid forged steel of slightly differing dimensions. The blocks were sited on the axis of two facing galleries in such a way that, depending on where the viewer stood, the distant block appeared to be suspended above the near block. Similarly, with one exception, the drawings in the series consist of two nearly identical rectangular shapes, one above the other. The effect of the series depends on the viewer's experience of the slight irregularities and asymmetries in the two forms that com- prise each panel. With their impressive size- each drawing is between ten and thirteen feet tall-and the ponderous, impenetrable blacks and the asphaltlike density of the layered paintstick, the drawings impose themselves as physical presences in much the same way as Serra's monumental sculptures. -WWR SOL LEWITT American, b. 1928 Irregular Form, 1998 Gouache on very heavy wove paper, 1536 x 1549 mm Gift of Carol and Sol LeWitt, 1999.237 Since 1967, Sol LeWitt has been identified with a series of highly influential statements emphasizing the importance of the idea in generating a work of art. What is often forgot- ten about these statements, however, is that for LeWitt, the idea is equated with intuition. "The idea-intuition comes first," he has said, indicating a degree of responsiveness that a strictly rational approach might forbid. Over time, loopy lines and intensely colored gouaches have evolved from ascetic permuta- tions of straight lines and right angles in black, white, and gray. Irregular Form, the large, intensely colored red-on-blue "blob" (as LeWitt calls this shape), was made as part of a group of gouache * . 101</page><page sequence="62">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 drawings, when he was interested in the idea of figure and ground. Its title intimates its opposite-"regular" form-and functions, as most of LeWitt's titles do, as the generating idea. LeWitt has said that the "irregular forms" respond to such earlier works as the series of huge wall paintings he conceived for the Sackler Museum in 1997. These paintings feature geometric hard-edged shapes, but like the "blobs," the Sackler shapes read as colored figures on colored grounds, with the grounds "fighting to come through." In Irregular Form, the red against blue creates perfect optical parity, and the short, choppy brush strokes with which LeWitt applied the red paint yield their own optical effect, especially in contrast to the more fluid, less visible strokes of blue. What might have been just an image of red paint against blue looms in the eye and hangs on as afterimage. -LN 1zi1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~... . .&gt;/- 4+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~u CHRISTIAN BOLTANSKI French, b. 1944 Untitled, from Favorite Objects, 1998 Photocopies, each 27.3 X 21 cm (sheet) Margaret Fisher Fund, M24173.1-4 As long ago as 1971, Christian Boltanski said, "Au depart mon probleme etait: arreter le temps, arreter la mort" ("From the start my problem was to stop time, to stop death"). ... .. .. .. .. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .... 102</page><page sequence="63">FOGG ART MUSEUM He built one of his most famous installation works from a pre-World War II photograph of Austrian Jewish schoolchildren. The poignancy of loss was doubtless amplified by the fate of their race, yet Boltanski also intended us to be aware of the loss inherent simply in maturation: Adulthood represents the death of childhood. In Favorite Objects, Boltanski enlisted the collaboration of 264 three- to eighteen-year- old pupils at the Lycee Francais in Chicago. They brought to school their favorite objects and developed their own artworks based upon them. The ultimate unique artwork that evolved from this yearlong project was an installation of the students' works along with 264 photographs taken by Boltanski of their sources of inspiration. The photographs have been published in an edition of 264 prints, and the entirety is being sold to raise funds for the school. No doubt the artist's intention is not only that we reflect on the time stopped by these images of objects cherished by a small group of Chicago children in 1998. He must also expect the children themselves, when time has moved on and they have become adults, to reflect on their choices, since passed. -MBC CHARLES LONG, WITH ANA WOLOVICK American, b. 1958; b. 1973 Theaters of the Body, from The Internalized Page Project, 1998 Iris digital print, 21.6 x 28 cm Margaret Fisher Fund, M23951 Charles Long has said about his sculptures, "The presentation of an abstract, freestanding mass reinforces the impression that we exist as selves in and apart from the world that produces us." Here, in collaboration with Ana Wolovick, he has used the computer to materialize abstract, freestanding mass on the printed page. The "internalized page" of his portfolio's title is no more than the common yellow, lined scratchpad, metabolized through its antipode, electronic digital programming. Long has caused a yellow pad's color and con- figuration to metamorphose into the apparent surface and environment of spawning crea- tures, which are both in and apart from the peculiar paper universe that seems to have produced them. We have so strong a mental image of the standard yellow pad-its shape, size, pattern, and color-that we immediately understand that this universe must somehow exist beyond our conventional world of linear time and three dimensions. Long's creatures are alarming but not sinister, and perhaps we can empathize with them, to appreciate our own situation in and apart from our world. Andrew Perchuk, in his review in Artforum of a 1997 exhibition of Long's computer- generated sculptures, which were poised on and in banal, used furniture, remarked on "his ability to imbue the high-tech with a homey goofiness.' -MBC 103</page><page sequence="64">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 JOSEPH MARIONI American, b. 1943 Red Painting 1999 No. 4 Acrylic and linen on stretcher, 243.2 X i80.7 cm Gift of Deborah and Martin Hale in honor of Michael Fried, 1999.249 In 1970, Joseph Marioni began to call himself "The Painter" and to limit his painting to monochrome, applying rich layerings of care- fully differentiated tones of color with a roller. .-* ---. He has said that the roller allows the acrylic to flow and drip in ways that are expressive of the medium itself and avoid any intimation of drawing. A brush would direct and constrain the paint to the beginning and end of each stroke. While informed by others who have worked in this manner, such as Malevich, Newman, Rothko, Reinhardt, Yves Klein, Ryman, and Marden, Marioni's monochromes are more phenomenological, more iconic, and more anthropomorphic than those of his abstract expressionist or minimalist predeces- sors. He is committed to an "essence" of painting, both in the formalist sense posited by critic Michael Fried's reading of Clement Greenberg, and in a more specifically religious sense: His paintings are meant to oper- ate as both image and icon, and he relishes the corporeal asso- ciation of paint with skin. Red Painting is the fourth in a set of four paintings executed in anticipation of the Fogg's selec- tion of one. It is a large, vertical plane of deep mahogany red- brown, painted in acrylic in two distinctly applied layers: one thick and one thin. Marioni's painterly effects-edges that shrink and pull apart to reveal the stain below, the implied movement of the medium, "breathing room" between layers, and the orientation and scale of the canvases- anthropomorphize the surface. Red Painting entreats us to interact with it as with a body and not as a picture of assorted forms or things or parts. -LN 104</page></plain_text>
