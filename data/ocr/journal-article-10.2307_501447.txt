<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Review MARGARETE BIEBER GREEK SCULPTURE. A CRITICAL REVIEW, by Rhys Carpenter. Pp. xiv + 276, figs. in text 3, pls. 47. The University of Chicago Press, I960. $6.95. The distinguished scholar and teacher, author of The Humanistic Value of Archaeology, Martin Classical Lectures No. 4, Harvard University Press, 1933, and of The Esthetic Basis of Greek Art, Bryn Mawr College, 1921, of which a revised edition has been published by the Indiana University Press, 1959, takes in this book a new approach to our understanding of Greek sculpture: "An attitude of intellectual aloofness without show of human in- terest is essential to the purpose of this book, which seeks to understand and explain the evolution of sculptural style in ancient Greece" (foreword, p. v). Carpenter regards "sculpture as an anonymous product of an impersonal craft." He investigates the reasons why stylistic changes have taken place during the six hundred years of Greek sculpture. Among these reasons the technique of the artist's craft is stressed, in contrast to "the genius of the individual artist striving for self-expression of an inner vision of his own." Carpenter chides (p. 255) Gisela Richter and this reviewer because they in their studies "concern themselves mainly with the historical career of Greek sculpture and incline to neglect its stylistic and esthetic worth." I wish to defend us women scholars against this reproach. I feel that we appreciate esthetic and ethical worth and the stylistic characteristics of the different pe- riods just as much as our male colleagues. As to the historical development, nobody can neglect it in the face of the fact that logical de- velopment, step by step, is one of the foremost and almost unique characteristics of Greek art. Indeed, the book by Carpenter is arranged chronologically: I. The Beginnings. II. The Archaic Phase. III. Early Reliefs and Hollow Cast Bronzes. IV. Toward the Formation of a Classic Style. V. Temple Pedi- ments: Classic Drapery. VI. High Classic. VII. Sculpture of the Third Century. VIII. The Re- nascence of Classic Form. IX. The Intrusion of Plastic Form. It is true that all these chapters over- lap in the materials used. Chapter I begins with monumental glyptic sculp- ture, the art of cutting life-size figures out of solid blocks; that is, with the later part of the seventh century B.C. Excluded are not only all works of Cretan-Mycenaean art and the Cycladic statuettes carved from island marble (the latter not even mentioned), but all bronze and terracotta figurines of the eighth and seventh century, as being plastic, that is, modeled sculpture, in contrast to glyptic, or carved sculpture. Carpenter distinguishes figurines from later statuettes which were influenced by the monumental style. He believes rightly that the Greek sculptors learned their craft in Egypt, with its old tradition of carving life-size or over-lifesize statues from a rectangular block. The technique of constructing a full-scale replica of physical reality was practised in Egypt two thousand years before the Greeks came to know it. Egyptian sculpture remained stereotyped. The Greeks learned tech- nical skill from them and developed it further in their Kouroi, as Gisela Richter has so excellently described (Kouroi: Archaic Greek Youths, A Study of the Development of the Kouros Type in Greek Sculpture, Phaidon Press, second ed., i96I). Car- penter believes that the stance with the left leg ad- vanced still survives in the Doryphoros of Poly- kleitos. The process of first roughly dressing a rectangular block "into human form by carrying back into the solid stone the four bodily contours of front, rear, and lateral profiles" is demonstrated by Carpenter on the unfinished Kriophoros of Thasos (pp. iif, pl. i), while the following stage is described in the Kouros of New York (pp. 12f, pls. II-III) where the details, eyes, ears, mouth, fin- gers and so on, are applied as "superficial accretions of linear pattern forms." The Greek artist could not imitate the Egyptian feminine fashion of cling- ing transparent clothing because social convention did not permit seeing a living woman. Thus he had to incise the folds and surface patterns of con- temporary costume in the Hera of Cheramyes and the Lyons Kore (p. 21, pl. Iv). The horse was ad- mitted to the forefront of sculptural interest beside the humans because it was "so much a part of hu- man experience" in a horse-breeding community (pp. 25f).</page><page sequence="2">238 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 66 The figures described in the first chapter really belong in the second chapter, the archaic phase of the sixth century. The period is described as an art of "conventional irrealism" (p. 27), one of the many appropriate terms coined by Carpenter. He finds the source of the peculiar qualities of archaic sculpture in the technical evolution of its forms, not in the emotional apprehension of art. The develop- ment is primarily due to the physiology and psy- chology of human vision. He explains this in detail (pp. 28-41), for "sculpture is a visual and not a tac- tile art, because it is made for the eyes to contem- plate and not for the fingers to feel" (p. 34). He compares the life-size marble statues in their tec- tonic appeal and coherence to Greek architecture and vase painting (pp. 41-43, fig. i, Amphora by Andokides). He believes that the tectonic structure of the anatomic canon as formulated by the archaic masters has given to all classic nude sculpture an organic unity still found in the Apoxyomenos and other male statues of the fifth and fourth centuries B.c., only modified by more complex study of mus- cular articulation. The advance from early to late archaic study is shown (beginning p. 46) by comparing the New York and Analysos Kouroi (pls. Iii and v-vi). The author always gives an excellent analysis of the technical process and the linear conception of sculp- tural form. The motive for the evolved archaic form is given as "the desire to impart an appearance of corporeal life to an inert piece of stone" (p. 47). The Lyons Kore (pl. iv) is compared with the late archaic Kore by Euthydikes (pl. xi) in order to explain the technical procedure, which made the artists give to the marble block first the primary shape of the nude body and thereafter proceed to incise upon the surface the pattern for the features of the face, the hair, the folds and zigzag hem of the costume. Carpenter compares red-figured vases (pp. 52-55). The dissolution of the archaic stylistic tradition came about because the artist felt his failure to represent living men and women of the visual world (pp. 56-58). The first part of the third chapter is dedicated to a concise survey of Greek reliefs (pp. 59-61). Relief begins earlier than sculpture in the round, but with a pictorial form which emanates from line-drawn colored pictures. The contours become engraved and later converted to sculptured real form. This carved relief is dependent on monu- mental sculpture in the round, as best seen in the stele of Aristion by Aristokles (pl. viii), which shows the lateral profile of a standing man. Relief thus is a protean form of art, between graphic and sculptured form. It became more and more detached from the ground. The main part of the third chapter is devoted to the discussion of hollow cast bronzes (pp. 67-85). Bronze statuary was a late comer and therefore developed from the glyptic tradition. The first metal statuary was produced by hammered metal sheets over a wooden core. Later the craftsmen took casts from the wooden figures. Rhoikos and Theodoros of Samos were the inventors of a work- able method of casting large thin-walled bronzes from these clay molds. In their homeland, the island of Samos, there had been developed in the seventh century the production of bronze armor and caul- drons in the repouss6 technique. When the metal impressed in the mold was chilled, it was freed from the matrix and then finer details were en- graved. The statues were assembled from a number of pieces cast in separate molds. The method is de- scribed by Friedrich von Schiller in his Song of the Bell and illustrated on the Foundry vase of about 475 (P. 78, figs. 2-3). The method of casting head, arms and legs in separate molds explains the greater freedom of movement in bronzes as compared to marble statues cut from one block. The main exam- ples, the charioteer of Delphi (pl. x) and the Dis- kobolos by Myron (pl. ix), whose original must have been a hollow-cast bronze, have gone beyond the archaic phase of sculpture. Thus this chapter overlaps again the fourth, "Toward the Formation of a Classic Style," that is, the period generally called the early classical style. The author considers the development from late archaic (pls. xi-xii) to Polykleitos' Doryphoros (pls. xiii-xiv). The dissolution of archaic art is caused by its failure to imitate the world of visual ap- pearance. Linear definition is replaced by mimetic realism. Details like eyes, ears, wrists, hands, divi- sions of the torso advance with increasing approach to objective truth. This again has been shown in great detail for the early classical period by Gisela Richter in her new edition of Kouroi, which goes down to the "Omphalos Apollo." In him emerges the classic form of the fifth century, where "bodily substance replaces graphic definition." In him, as before him in the Kore of Euthydikes, the Blond Boy, and the Kritios Boy, the pattern and linear motifs flow "as an accompaniment and a com-</page><page sequence="3">1962] A REVIEW 239 mentary to the solid forms over which they travel" (p. 89). Decorative surface pattern develops into functional presentation of the solid volume. Bodily substance replaces graphic definition. Symmetry in the sense of measurable concordance develops (p. 92). In the Doryphoros the integration of the parts within an over-all numerical scheme has reached its culmination (p. ioo). Symmetrical asymmetry in- troduces "differentiation between tension and relax- ation, between contraction and expansion into each bodily feature in contrast with its opposite counterpart" (p. o105). In the fifth chapter, "Temple Pediments and Classic Drapery" are combined, because the de- velopment of the representation of drapery is in the first place shown in the pediment figures of the fifth century: Aegina, Olympia (pls. xv-xvii) and the Parthenon (pls. xIx, xxi). "The Greek architect conceived his task in the same visual terms and aimed at the same artistic effects as did his sculptural fellow" (p. Io9). The metopes, friezes and pedi- ment sculpture developed from painting, the acro- teria and roof decorations from terracotta. The pedi- ments were first shallow reliefs and last fully de- tached statuary. The sculptures in the pediment of the temple of Aegina are influenced by bronzes. They achieved for the first time unity of scale. The artists of the pediments of the temple of Zeus at Olympia and of the Parthenon composed their figures so adroitly that the triangular frame does not dominate, but the composition seems to de- termine the shape of the frame. The fifth century sculptors began to appreciate the "distinction be- tween the carved block and the seen statue . . . At Olympia we may see them working their way to an optically effective solution to an extremely subtle visual problem" (p. 123). The Greek sculp- tors used the solution to make statues appear as modeled shapes instead of flat projections, which the architects had discovered for their moldings: on a flat surface they used the meander; on a parabolic curved surface the egg and dart; on a circular roundel the spherical bead and reel; and on an ogival or alternately convex and concave sur- face the Lesbian kymation or ogival leaf pattern. Thus "the pattern on the visual field interprets the unintelligible profile in the axis of depth" (p. I25). The sculptors learned from the architects the modeling line, and a basic technical difficulty was resolved, as best seen on the pediment statues of the Parthenon. The drapery gave the opportunity to impart a visual sense of modeled depth. This is shown, be- side the pediment figures, on the statues of the stumbling Niobid (pl. xviii), the drunken old woman (pl. xx), the tomb relief of Dexileos, the Nike temple parapet, the Nike of Paionios, the Cybele and the Leda in Boston, and the reliefs of the dancing Maenads (pls. xxiI-xxvII, pp. 139-151). On the Parthenon are developed the four main geometric modes of representing drapery: "the modelling line, the catenary, the motion line, the illusionary transparency-out of this restricted series of formal devices all later fifth century drapery was evolved" (p. I39; cf. p. 151). Under "High Classic" in Chapter VI the author treats the art of the late fifth and the fourth cen- tury. He therefore begins with the same figures of the fifth century which he has used to demonstrate the development of rendering drapery (pls. xxii- xxvIn). He distinguishes the earlier fifth century down to the Parthenon as formal art, whose severe correctness is changed to grace, elegant pose, and sophisticated formal drapery. The devices of the classic formulas became pictorially intensified and lost their special reality. The late fifth century style is continued in Timotheos of Epidauros and Attic tombstones. The great masters of the fourth cen- tury except Praxiteles and Lysippos are disregarded, and attention is concentrated on sculptural art and evolutionary sequence (p. I6o). In the nude male figures, like the Bronze from Antikythera (pls. xxvIII-xxix), the classic abstract formalism is modified into formalized naturalism. The Diskobolos by Myron (pl. Ix) and the Zeus from Artemision (pl. xxv) are static in their anato- my, vivid only in their silhouettes; "the torso shows no response to the spreading arms or the straddled legs" (p. i65). The figure of a bronze youth found in a sunken ship off Antikythera (pls. xxvIII-xxix), the athletes from the school of Polykleitos, the run- ner in the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the boxer in Dresden (pl. xxxI) begin the process of move- ment in the third dimension which Lysippos has consummated. "Praxiteles had no share in this eminently logical sequence of technical advance from the four-sided pier of archaism toward the free suspension in space of the spirally rotated figure" (p. I74). The author does not believe that the Hermes is an original by Praxiteles, but at- tributes to him, on the other hand, the Bronze Boy from Marathon. The chapter ends with a short de-</page><page sequence="4">240 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 66 scription of the drapery on the carved base from a column of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (pp. 176f, pl. xxxiiI) and the Alexander sarcopha- gus from the late fourth century: "the episodic tex- ture line has invaded the abstractly formal patterns to effect an unstable compromise between the artis- tically imagined and the everyday actual" (p. 179). Chapter VII, "Sculpture of the Third Century," deals with the early Hellenistic evolution, which continued the course maintained by the sons of Praxiteles and the pupils of Lysippos. The tradi- tion of bronze casting was also continued in the Demosthenes by Polyeuktos and the Seated Hermes from Herculaneum (pl. xxxiv). The Lysippan par- tial torsion evolved into continuous axial rotation: "the figure of the Hermes moves consistently through an arc of some ninety degrees" (p. 183). In the Hermes, the Aphrodite Kallipygos and the dancing faun, the "sculptors sought to justify the pose by inventing plausible motivations for it" (p. 184). With tridimensional spatial presentation "the long process of stylistic evolution from pictorial vision to stereomorphic reproduction of material structure reaches its culmination." The conflict be- tween esthetic form and physical reality is grow- ing. The best works of the middle of the third cen- tury are portraits like those of the Egyptian queens and of the young woman from Perinthos with a braid around her head (pl. xxxv). Mimetic fidel- ity triumphs over the artificialities of the Classic tradition (p. 188). In Pergamon originals from Aegina and copies of masterpieces from Athens were assembled. The latter, for example the Athena Parthenos, are, however, not real copies but re- creations. In the late third century the Gauls were represented for Athens in less than life size. An- other example of this size not yet used in the clas- sical period is the bronze dancer in the Baker col- lection (Dorothy Thompson, AJA 44 [1950] 372ff, pls. 1-3, II, 14). The chapter closes with an enthusi- astic description of the Aphrodite from Cyrene (pl. xxxvi). The author considers it a culmination in Greek sculptured art. Chapter VIII, "The Renascence of Classic Form," deals with the second century B.c. The title is at first startling, as the large frieze of the great altar of Zeus in Pergamon, the Nike of Samothrace (pl. xxxvII) and the Laokoon are generally regarded as examples of a first "baroque" style, quite different from anything belonging to the classical period. The author, in contrast, believes that "the naturalis- tic phase in Hellenistic Greece was an unenduring stage of stylistic evolution. And since the attainment of a perfect technique of naturalism seemed to de- bar further progress on the century-old path of mimetic realism, and no wholly new style could be imagined, the only apparent recourse was a re- turn to earlier formalism-but with a new way of envisaging its esthetic possibilities" (p. 198). "The self-sufficing calm of the third century naturalistic style was abruptly broken by a return to earlier formal traditions. But there is this difference, that solid form on the altar frieze is rendered literally instead of through optical suggestion; the classic devices do not have to function spatially but at- tach themselves as decorative additions to bodily form already fully shaped without their aid" (p. 200). The author gives a wonderful formal de- scription of the Victory from Samothrace (pp. 201- 204). The heroic statue of a semi-draped man found in the temple of Hera in Pergamon has a tradi- tional arrangement of the himation, but in the tonal range of light and shadow unnatural classical for- mulas are adapted to artistic ends (pl. xxxvIII, pp. 204-205). The author finds similar revived classical formulas in the Tragoidia and other female statues from Pergamon and Magnesia. "Second-century sculptors take refuge in the past to evade the pres- ent. They saw.. . that the artist's province was not the imitation of nature but a re-creation of the visible in terms of esthetic apprehension and emo- tional response (p. 206) . . . after several decades of unchecked experimentation . . . what begins as liberty ends in ungoverned license (p. 207) . .. a baroque or free emotive phase is almost necessarily succeeded by an academic renascence of earlier traditions" (p. 208). The Borghese fighter by Aga- sias is characterized as a direct derivative of the unfactual classic tradition of formal linear analysis. "Agasias has applied to the nude the same con- version of classic formula into dramatic emotional- ism which is so conspicuous a characteristic of the drapery styles of his day" (p. 220). The Laokoon group, the Barberini Faun, the Menelaos with Pa- troklos, the Dying Gaul are other examples of a calculated heightening of classic formula for dra- matic effect. The author dates all these in ca. 190o- 140 B.C. In the first century the seated Boxer, the Belvedere Torso and the Hellenistic Ruler (pl. XLVIIA) return to the late fifth century heroic man- ner, disregarding the Hellenistic interlude (p. 225).</page><page sequence="5">1962] A REVIEW 241 The last chapter, under the title "The Intrusion of Plastic Form," deals with Greek portraiture. The author wants to show the emergence of plastic technique as a final phase of pre-Roman statuary, applied first on coins, then on bronze portraits such as the head of a man from Delos and the head of an old man found on the sunken ship from An- tikythera (pls. XLIV-XLV). Faithful and fully indi- vidualized portraiture was impossible as long as a canon of simple arithmetical proportions was ap- plied to sculptural features of head and body in all portraits of the fifth, fourth and third century (see pl. XLIII). Greek metallurgists used wax for fashion- ing minor objects. This technique was first used for coins of Persian satraps, and from numismatics the technique of modeling was adapted for realistic portraiture, according to Carpenter, about 200 B.c. In wax the artists could reproduce the rise and fall of undulant surfaces and all mimetic devia- tions from canonic norm which makes each in- dividual different. Perhaps this wax technique was only used for heads, while the bodies are in the gen- eral glyptic style. Carpenter gives as an example the Hellenistic Ruler (pl. XLVIB head and XLVIIA statue). He also believes that late Hellenistic groups like the Laokoon were not possible without plastic models. I have quoted more sentences of Professor Car- penter's book verbatim than I usually do. The reason is that I could not adequately express his ideas in as admirable, highly cultured and refined a style as his. In his review (ArtB 39 [I957] 67- 73) of my Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age Profes- sor Carpenter has expressed the different concep- tion of Greek art which we have in excellent form. He says, for example, "Where weakness lies is in the failure to look closely at anatomic detail, at drapery understood not as a costume . . . but as functional sculptural form, and at technical ac- complishment instead of representational content." I confess that all these three points are of less in- terest to me than the conception the artist tries to visualize and represent in his creative work. I do not believe that one can understand a work of art without asking what the artist wanted to represent before judging how he represented it and how he achieved his goal. A certain knowledge of anatomy and of Greek clothing is also necessary. The tech- nique, in my opinion, can help or hinder the execu- tion of a work, but does not create it. The artist will use the best technique for his work, but he will also strive to improve it. He will use older forms like a quotation without being an imitator. I, therefore, would not call the Pergamon altar a "renascence of classic form" because its artist quotes some of the masterpieces of the fifth century, quot- ing them as one quotes from a classic. It has an intelligible plan because the gods are arranged ac- cording to a learned but quite intelligible arrange- ment. Examples of how pure consideration of anatomy and of drapery without regard to the content can lead to mistakes are the drunken old woman (pl. xx) and the Marsyas (pl. xxxi), the one attributed to, the other taken away from Myron. The drunken hag has in my opinion no similarity to the stum- bling Niobid (pl. xviii), even if in both cases the folds stop their geometric pattern when they reach the ground. On the Niobid the folds flow and spread out on the ground in soft waves; on the old woman there is an abrupt break and a separate triangle below the right knee with heavy baroque waves in the style of the Pergamon frieze. Besides, there are four more reasons for dating the old woman in the Hellenistic period: I. The bottle which she hugs is the lagynos, a form developed in the Hellenistic period. 2. The dress with the broad clasp holding the two parts of the chiton to- gether is the peronatris, a form which does not oc- cur before the Hellenistic period. 3. The dry skin and sunken flesh of breast and neck are not rep- resented in statues before the Hellenistic period. 4. The motif of a drunkard or other representation of low-class life is not rendered in monumental art before that period. As to the Marsyas, he belongs to the same time as the Protesilaos, in the middle of the fifth century, as Gisela Richter recently has shown again in her Catalogue of Greek Sculpture of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1954 (PP- 22f). Both have the transitory pose in a momentary action, like the Diskobolos. The coins (Carpenter, "Observation on Familiar Statuary in Rome," MAAR I8 [I941] pl. 6A) distinctly show him to- gether with the Frankfurt Athena, in the group by Myron. Myron and his contemporaries in the early classical period made experiments which the Peri- clean age dropped and only the Hellenistic period took up again. (Cf. also my review of "Observation" in AJPhZ 60: 8 [i947] 88ff.) Another dating which this reviewer cannot accept is that of the Landsdowne Amazon (p. 152) in the high classic, that is, the late fifth or fourth century,</page><page sequence="6">242 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 66 in contrast to the formal manner of the Mattei Amazon "which might be Polykleitan." I see in the Mattei Amazon near relation in the style of the drapery to the Parthenon pediments, while the stance, the dress and the hair of the Landsdowne Amazon shows the same "chiastic contrast between physical left and right" as described by Carpenter for the Doryphoros (p. o105). The reviewer in an article on the chiton of the Ephesian Amazons (JdI 33 [I918] 29-75, pls. 1-3) has demonstrated that the four Amazons are all dressed in similar chitons, only differently arranged and differently stylized, and that the different styles of the Mattei and the Landsdowne Amazon agree with known works by Phidias and Polykleitos. The Landsdowne Amazon is more often copied than the others, which agrees with Pliny, Nat. Hist. 34-53, who tells that in a con- test for Amazons to be dedicated in the temple of Artemis at Ephesos, Polykleitos was the first win- ner, while Phidias came next. The ponderation and chiastic contrast between left and right as well as between upper and lower members, and the dif- ferentiation between tension and relaxation, are the same in the Amazon as in the Doryphoros. The clear and simple arrangement of hair and dress has the same principles as the hair and the body of the Doryphoros. Each part is clearly marked off from its neighbor. The canon of proportions is in both statues the same. This canon is described by Galen (Placita Hip- pocratis et Platonis 5), who says: "Chrysippos holds that beauty does not consist in the elements but in the harmonious proportion of the parts, that is to say, of one finger to the other finger and of all the fingers to the palm and wrist, and of these to the forearm and of the forearm to the whole arm, and of all parts to all others, as they are set forth in the Canon of Polykleitos. For Polykleitos, when he had taught us all the proportion of the human figure by means of that treatise, confirmed his theory by a practical illustration and made a statue according to the dictates of the theory, and called the statue, like the treatise, his canon" (tr. H. Stu- art Jones; a more complicated translation, Carpen- ter, p. 1o2). Carpenter believes that no one has so far succeeded in extracting the recipe of the written canon "through failure to grasp the principles on which the canon was constructed." In his Esthetic Basis of Greek Art (second ed., pp. 93f) he had suggested "that the rigidity of numerical precision should be tempered by deliberate irregularity to give life and warmth to mathematical exactitude." The reviewer is of the firm conviction that the solution of the problem is the golden section, de- scribed as perfect proportion by Plato, Timaeus 7.31B-32A, according to which, as in Galen, the smaller part is related to the larger as the larger is to the whole: "The best of bonds is that which makes itself and those which it binds as complete a unity as possible; and the nature of proportion is to accomplish this most perfectly. For when of any three numbers, whether expressing three or two dimensions, one is a mean term, so that as the first is to the middle, so is the middle to the last; and conversely, as the last is to the middle, so is the middle to the first and last, and the last and the first become middle, of necessity all will come to the same, and being the same with one another, all will be a unity." The same golden proportions are also found in the pentagon, which is the symbol of the Pythago- reans and embodies their theory of numbers. The diagonals are related to the sides in the golden section, and the diagonals at their crossings are divided in the same golden section (see Euclid 6.30). In the human body the smallest part is the first phalanx of the finger. It is indeed related to the second phalanx, as the second is to the third, and the third is related to the first plus the second again in the same proportion. This proportion is irra- tional and incommensurable and cannot be ex- pressed except by square roots. It can, however, easily be measured by the golden sector, a circle invented in Germany by the sculptor Max Schnei- der and described by Adalbert Goeringer (Der goldene Schnitt, goittliche Proportion und seine Be- ziehung zum menschlichen Kdrper, second ed., Munich 191I). The compass is so constructed that the two parts of the golden section are indicated by a central point connected with the two outer legs in a hinge which keeps the central point stable and divides the distance between the two outer legs in the proportion of the golden section. When used on a well-proportioned man or woman, or the Doryphoros, or the Diadumenos, or the Lands- downe Amazon this golden proportion will al- ways be the same as described by Chrysippos in Galen. What Polykleitos did was to replace the static geometric proportions used by the Egyptians and the archaic Greek sculptors with an organic and anthropomorphic system of relations, different</page><page sequence="7">1962] A REVIEW 243 in every individuum. It is not an absolute measure, like the static multiplication of one number, for example the length of the foot, but a dynamic sys- tem of relations, different in every individuum. In a representation it gives unity, variety and beauty to a work of art. It gives satisfaction to the eye, because every part is so regulated as to bear good proportions to the whole. Thus the golden section, which underlies the canon of Polykleitos, is the proportion in which the ratio between the smaller and the bigger equals the ratio between the bigger and the whole. Because this proportion is difficult to understand, Polyklei- tos made a canon, an example of perfect propor- tions, in the Doryphoros. While his school followed it, new canons of proportions were made by Euphra- nor (whose Paris I would like to see in the "Ball- player," Carpenter, pl. xxviii), and by Lysippos. In recent times the golden section has again been used by architects in combination with other sim- pler elements (see E. Panofsky, "The History of the Human Proportion as a Reflection of the His- tory of Styles," in Meaning in the Visual Arts, Doubleday Anchor Book 1955, 64ff and 84ff; Le Corbusier, Le Modulor, Boulogne 1950; R. Witt- kower, "System of Proportion," Architects' Year Book 5, pp. 9-18, the pentagon p. 12, fig. 3). It is much to be desired that someone who knows sculp- ture and mathematics work out the canon of Poly- kleitos. The Demeter of Knidos (p. 213f, pl. xL) is dated by the author in the second century B.c. The re- viewer agrees with Ashmole (JHS 71 [i95i] 13-28, pls. i-xvi), who compares her head with the young Alexander (Carpenter, pl. XLIII, 2). This places the statue in the time of Alexander the Great. Carpen- ter, however, compares the Aphrodite of Melos, whose head imitates the head of the Knidia (pl. xxxix). There a head of the fourth century has been fitted to a body of the second century. The reviewer, however, does not see this similarity. The head of the Aphrodite of Melos, despite a simi- lar shape, has a quite different style: form and expression lack the Praxitelean "melting gaze of the eyes with their bright and joyous expression" (Lucian, Eikones 6). The drapery has parallels in late fourth century tomb reliefs like the one from Rhamnus (Lullies and Hirmer, Griechische Plas- tik fig. 219). Here as well as in the Column drum from Ephesos (pl. xxxiiI) there is "intrusion of tex- tural realism, which broke the long running dra- pery lines into discontinuous ridges and interrupt- ing folds, disturbing their geometrically calculated curves with haphazard wrinkles and irrelevant shifts of surface. . . ." This is also true of the Maussolos (pp. 214-216, pl. XLI), which the author regards as a second century work. Nobody believes any longer that the well-preserved statue could have stood in the chariot on the roof. This reviewer has tried to show that the king must have stood in the tomb chamber (Anthemon. Scritti di archeologia e di antiquitd classicha in onore di Carlo Anti [19541 3-7, pl. ii). Therefore the back has been negli- gently worked. Arrangement and folds on the breast are similar to those on the breast of Alkestis on the column from Ephesos. The small folds and creases which a garment gets when lying in a chest are visible in the Alkestis as well as in the Maus- solos. When the himation of Maussolos has deeper furrows and cavities than the Alkestis, these are due to the enormous size of the cult statue. The main reason for dating the Maussolos in the second instead of the fourth century is the head, which the author believes looks "like a study in modelled wax." This in his opinion was not done before about 200zoo B.c. He, therefore, also removes Menander, for him Vergil, and Epicurus from the early to the late Hellenistic period. The main rea- sons for the "Menander" or "Vergil," mostly in favor of Menander, have been given by Gisela Richter (Greek and Roman Antiquities in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection 4-Io, no. 4). The Epicurus portrait cannot be separated from those of his pupils Metrodoros and Hermarchos, for their statues have similar conception and style. The main reason why the author dates a number of portraits later than the reviewer and other schol- ars is his rejection of the statement of Pliny (Nat. Hist. 35.153) that Lysistratos, the brother of Lysip- pos, introduced the practice of taking impressions of the human face: "hominis autem imaginem gypso e facie ipsa primus omnium expressit, cera- que in eam formam gypsi infusa emendare instituit Lysistratus Sicyonius, frater Lysippi de quo dixi- mus. Hic et similitudines reddere instituit, ante quem quam pulcherrimas facere studebant. Idem et de signis effigies exprimene invenit ... ." When studying the original texts which the author omits, it becomes clear that the translation by Carpenter of facie as human form is wrong, for Pliny clearly speaks about portraits of men, whose faces he wanted to make into realistic likenesses. Only the</page><page sequence="8">244 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 66 following sentence deals with statues. There was a tendency to make realistic instead of idealistic portraits in the fourth century, and therefore Lysis- tratos invented the glyptic wax technique to further this desire of the artists. I do not believe that tech- nique creates a new style, but it furthers the con- ceptions and creations of the artists. I am glad to see the "Berenike" (pl. XLIII, 3) and her replica from Perinthos (pl. xxxv) firmly estab- lished in the third century. I left her out of my Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age, also out of the second enlarged edition, because I was not sure how to place her. On the other hand I wonder why the Dioskuros of Monte Cavallo is placed on the plate (XLVII) with the Hellenistic ruler. In the text he is only mentioned once (p. 44). It is stated that he copies "at twice its size a figure from the Par- thenon's east pediment," and that "the late fifth century formulation of the canon may be read most clearly." Furtwiingler, Meisterwerke griechischer Plastik (1893) I28ff, pl. vii, and Masterpieces (1895) 95ff, considered the two Dioskuroi as Roman mar- ble copies from bronze statues by Phidias and the older Praxiteles. Carpenter, in AJA 29 (1925), com- pared the Dioskuroi with the Hephaistos on the Madrid Puteal copied from the Hephaistos in the east pediment of the Parthenon. Homer Thompson ("The Odeion in the Athenian Agora," Hesperia 19 [1950] II9ff, pls. 77-79), believes that the proto- type of the Horse Tamers in Rome and the Giants carved for the decoration of the Odeion in its sec- ond, Antonine period is to be found in the Hephais- tos of the Parthenon east pediment, while the Tri- tons of the same building are derived from the Poseidon of the west pediment. This reviewer be- lieves that the classic form created in the Phidian age was remodeled in the Hellenistic period and then used as model form by the Romans with dif- ferent content. The Dioskuroi leading their horses were, since the Antonine period, represented on numerous Roman sarcophagi at the corners of the front reliefs. They symbolize there the passage from life to death and through death to immortal- ity. The Dioskuroi from Monte Cavallo cannot be earlier than the Antonine period, and they stood probably before the Bath of Constantine the Great. The constant pictorial tradition can be shown in this and in many other examples of ancient art. Perhaps the late Roman Dioskuros was added to the book because he gave a fine model for the effective although inexact design on the double title page by Adrian Wilson. There are no footnotes to the text, but careful documentation is found in the Bibliographical Sources (pp. 255-265). Standard works of reference are followed by specific works listed under the headings of the chapters in which they are discussed in the text; and by references to illustrations for the sculptures referred to in the text but not repro- duced in the plates. The plates have 70 well chosen figures in excellent reproductions printed by En- schede, at Haarlem, The Netherlands. A topical in- dex adds to the usefulness of the book. Despite some differences of opinion, it is a pleas- ure to read the brilliant study and clear presentation based on cumulative wisdom, gathered experience and serious contemplation of Greek art. The book is full of pithy remarks and observations. It will de- light most readers and bring them a deeper un- derstanding of the sculptor's craft and deeper esthetic appreciation of Greek art and of the gradual evolution of the different styles in the different pe- riods. The book may provoke some controversy, but the ingenious study lays the groundwork for a rational understanding of stylistic evolution. The book demands and rewards careful and repeated reading.
