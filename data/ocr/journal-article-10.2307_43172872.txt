However, students cannot develop % an understanding of every important concept in science through their own investigation. There are points in our lessons that require outside informa- tion, usually through some type of of literature. A main consideration is r . . fiction r . versus nonfiction. . However, chil- dren's fiction varies from children's non- LCtion in a significant manner: Children's don often includes anthropomorphic de- tions of plants and nonhuman animals, n Benchmarks for Science Literacy (1993), AAAS worries that the anthropomor- phism embedded in most animal stories may be misleading many young learners and proposes the following goal: "By the end of the second grade, students should now that stories sometimes give plants d animals attributes they really do not e" (p. 102). Indeed, children's literature idated with anthropomorphic accounts es of animals, from grouchy ladybugs to nonkeys, and it includes a whole host of laracters - Olivia, Arthur, and Babar to name a few. Although books may depict worms at- tending school and pigs building houses, all is not lost for science teachers. These anthropomorphic texts can pro- vide great opportunities for meaningful scientific learning about animals and their characteristics, while developing students' understanding of different kinds of texts. In this article we share a successful strategy for using anthropomorphic texts for deep and accurate science learning for primary students. To involve students in the analysis of anthropomorphisms, you will need a collection of nonfiction and fiction books related to a particular animal for each group of students. You may wish to have multiple sets if you want all the groups to discuss the same animal. Engage To get students interested in examining the fantastic and fanciful attributes of animals, we begin with a class discus- sion. The discussion is prompted by reading aloud amazing features of animals, some factual, some fiction. After each statement is read, students raise their hands to indicate if they believe the attribute is true or not. For example: • Reindeer keep warm by eating a type of antifreeze. (True: The moss they eat contains a chemical that keeps their body fluids warm. The moss itself offers no nutritional value.) • When a dolphin is sick or injured, it calls for help from other dolphins, who try to push it to the surface so that it can breathe. (True: Dolphins are highly social and communicative animals.) • If you lift a kangaroo's tail off the ground, it can't hop. (True: Kangaroos use their tails for balance.) • Hummingbirds cannot walk. Pigs, however can walk tightropes on their hind feet. (False: Pigs have cloven feet and the largest pigs can weigh over a ton - good luck on the tightrope.) We want students to think about the incredible things they have heard or read about animals and how to tell which ones are true. Disagreements and minor debates are all part of the discussion and, in fact, lead to the need for further exploration. November 2006 27</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1.

As you look to compile book sets of your own, we highly recom- mend that you begin with nonfiction; books that are attractive and accurate are harder to find than those that are fun and fictional. Also, the greatest student conversations stem from fictional texts that contain factual information; we've included a small listing of these under the heading "Fiction" for each animal. 28 Science and Children Evaluate (Preassessment) It is highly unlikely that most school- aged children be- lieve that pigs shop in supermarkets and that elephants really do have tea with the Queen of England, but at what point do students' literary experiences clash with an accurate scientific understanding of the world? The following preassessment allows students to consider what they currently know about human and animal characteristics through the creation of a concept map. Working in teams of three or four, students select or are assigned an animal and record anything they know about their animal on individual sticky notes. These notes are placed on chart paper to create a map show- ing how their ideas are connected to demonstrate their current thinking about their animal. (Students can also write their maps directly on chart paper, but the notes allow students to move ideas around as their ideas change during the group s discussion.) For example, spiders "eat flies or other flying bugs," "make webs," "have eight legs," and "are brown or black." This portion of the activity allows students to share what they currently know and understand about a particular animal and create consensus between the group members that will be necessary during the rest of the lesson. Explore The next step is to distribute the collection of books to each student team (see Figure 1). Allow students time to read through their books, about 15-20 minutes. You may want to create book "experts" by assigning a particular book to each student that they will then share with their team during the activity. Next, students create a chart listing characteristics of their animal from the various texts. These characteristics can then be placed in a graphic that separates charac- teristics that describe humans from characteristics that describe the animal (Figure 2, page 29) . Sticky notes can again be useful at this point. There may be characteristics that can be applied to both humans and the animal. The characteristics com- mon to both are placed on the chart where the circle and square overlap. Students may write down characteristics individually on notes and then as they share them with the group, they can discuss where to place each charac- teristic on the chart. If there is more than one note with the same characteristic, students can place one on top of the other so that all notes are placed on the chart. Explain Once students have had a chance to discuss their readings and have sorted the characteristics, they return to their concept map. They will now have an opportunity to reevaluate their map. They can rear-</page><page sequence="4">Graphic for characterizing human and animal characteristics.

As students go back and evaluate their concept map, any new concepts or links can be shown with a different color of pen or note. Once the concept maps have been discussed, direct the students to the "human" side of the chart and explain that giving humanlike characteristics to their animals is called anthropomorphism. Students can then brainstorm possible reasons why anthropo- morphisms are used in some fictional texts: • To make the animals less scary, • To make the story more interesting, • To give a new and different place to have a story (e.g., the world of a bat or mouse), • Because it is entertaining - the idea of a pig doing ballet or a worm going to school is funny. Evaluate (Postassessment) Once the concept map has been revised, the students will need to communicate their understanding of their animal to the class. This can be done through a "wanted poster" about the animal they studied. The main portion of the poster should depict and accurately describe the animal they discussed, integrating information from their con- cept map. However, you may want to direct students to leave the lower portion of the poster for an "also known as" section where students can place samples of anthropomor- phic characteristics they noted from their fictional texts. Each poster can be shared, posted, and discussed in class. Extend Students can now create their own fictional story and non- fiction accounts of another animal. At this point, you can allow more freedom about what topic students choose and how they gather information about their animal. Because the point of this part of the lesson is to de- velop their own books, students can use a variety of resources, such as reliable internet sites, videos, or, if possible, they can even collect their own data by mak- ing observations of live animals. Students may wish to present their fictional and nonfiction accounts through oral presentations, mini-plays, or by creating their own fiction and nonfiction book sets that can be shared and read by their classmates. Dispelling Misconceptions Ultimately, the best cure for anthropomorphic beliefs is rich and recurring experience with actual animals. Although some of us relish this approach, the reality is that many elementary teachers are reluctant to turn their classrooms into menageries. Though many texts instill and extend students' belief in anthropomorphisms, with explicit instruction they can also be powerful allies in the dispelling of these misconceptions. ■ Susan Gomez-Zwiep (sgomezwp@csulb.edu) and William Straits (wstraits@csulb.edu) are both assis- tant professors in the Department of Science Education at California State University Long Beach in Long Beach, California .
