The third fictional work analyzed is "The Stationmaster," in which Shaw demonstrates the function of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, depicted in the illustrations hanging on Samson Vyrin's wall. The volume concludes with two articles on Pushkin's journalistic prose. "The Problem of the 'Persona' in Journalism: Pushkin's Feofilakt Kosichkin" remains to date the most thor- ough study of both the literary ambiance and style of Pushkin's two satirical pieces. Finally, "Pushkin on America and His Principal Sources; 'John Tanner'" is a definitive study of Pushkin's response to American democracy as he understood it and as he could best express it on the pages of The Contemporary. Paul Debreczeny, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Nikolai Gogol. Dead Souls. Translated by Bernard Guilbert Guerney. Revised, edited, and with an introduction by Susanne Fusso. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996. xv + 287 pp., $14.00 (paper). Nikolai Gogol. Dead Souls. Translated and annotated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. Introduction by Richard Pevear. New York: Pantheon Books, 1996. xxiv + 403 pp., $27.50 (cloth). Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls will never rest in peace as long as their enigma continues to intrigue readers. To the impressive array of available translations, add these two outstanding versions, embodying vastly different methods, styles, and aesthetics. Dead Souls is a controversial work from a controversial author, interpreted variously as Romantic, Realist, or Surrealist. The work is characterized by its unique and bizarre humour, with fatally flawed and even misanthropic characters nonetheless portrayed compassionately. The author oversees his world, his narrative voice wiser than all, yet maintaining a certain (perhaps ironic) humility. A characteristically Slavic surrealist and satirical streak pervades the tale, including its use of Ukrainianisms (see, for example George Luckyj's Between Gogol and Shevchenko [Munich, 1971]). Difficulties in interpretation perhaps reflect Gogol's ambiva- lence regarding the contemporary social and political reality of the Russian empire as much as his own complex personality. Style precedes literal content or narrative in Dead Souls. Gogol utilized the Ukrainian vernacular to define a new language of Russian prose. The author's Russian seems at times surprisingly direct and modern, at times exquisitely formal, unpretentiously poetic or ironic, often allowing multiple levels of interpretation. Gogol inevitably offers a wink to the reader, and a good laugh at everyone's expense, including his own. Yet his intentions are serious, in expressing profound depth without affectation. His style commonly includes run-on sentences and the illusion of free-form free-associations which deviously disguise meticulously selected symbolic detail, as well as anthropomorphisms, language play, pleasantly shocking juxtaposi- tions of ideas, and uncommon linguistic macaronism. All of this makes the art of translation particularly challenging. Both versions under review commendably articulate these subtle aspects. First, a brief review of existing translations is in order. The first English version was the infamous anti-Russian propagandistic prank of 1854, secretly rewritten by the editors as Home Life in Russia-quite worthless as a translation, but of historical interest. The 1915 editions of Stephen Graham and D. J. Hogarth unfortunately offer neither great literary value nor accuracy. Constance Garnett's classic 1923 translation proves stylishly elegant and vivid,</page><page sequence="2">352 Slavic and East European Journal though it was criticized as polished to polite acceptability for the English-speaking audience, imposing the translator's style at the expense of the author's distinctive voice. David Magarshack's 1961 version is considered one of the best translations, generally faithful and accurate, even to sentence structure and breaks, and with greater subtlety in character presen- tation. George Reavey's 1985 work unfortunately takes liberties with structure and detail, though the result is a'smoothly pleasurable read. Bernard Guilbert Guerney, born north of Odessa and later Americanized, created the first translation sufficiently precise to meet the approval of the exacting Vladimir Nabokov. This 1942 edition breathes vitality and humour and stood as the most accurate to date. For good reason, then, Susanne Fusso chose to revise this version. Guerney's philosophy of translation entailed capturing the spirit rather than the letter of the text, and this approach generally succeeds. Fusso's painstaking editing included removal of draft material as well as mythologi- cal and fictional names added by Guerney. She also aimed for a more direct interpretation and closer adherence to the standard Russian edition. The language is still somewhat archaic and verbose-but perhaps appropriately so. This updated and admirably accurate translation is the more poetic and elevated version, with more consistently formal and complex English. The result is a refined and faithful rendition. The Pevear/Volokhonsky version offers an immediate and accessible style, while remaining close and true to the original, from paragraph and sentence structure to humour and simile. The work can be criticized for its occasional glaring British colloquialisms. More significantly, the clear, elegant language involves a perhaps necessary compromise: a slight diminishment in the original's sense of grandeur. Nevertheless, this modern approach, rather than interfering self-consciously with the communication, evocatively refracts the spectrum of Gogol's imag- ery in a lucid contemporary style. Both editions utilize recent Academy of Sciences editions of Gogol's collected works, which restore previously censored passages and are generally considered accurate. Both versions regrettably omit Gogol's intricately decorative title page, drawn by his own hand, and the charming illustrations which often accompany Russian versions. The unfinished second book of the planned trilogy remains, like Michelangelo's unfinished sculptures on display in Gogol's adopted Italy, paralyzed and struggling to take form, or, to mix dissimilar similes, indistin- guishable as the passing objects in the final troika scene. The Pevear/Volokhonsky edition includes the second volume; Fusso banishes selected excerpts to an appendix. Should colloquialisms and expressions be translated literally, or replaced with native En- glish equivalents? Literal accuracy entails the former, but textual accuracy requires that the original's implicit sense be maintained. Subtle differences prevail among the translations. Fusso has done well to purge Guerney's version of added details. For example, "He KpacaBeL" (7) was oddly rendered by Guerney as "no Adonis," but is translated by the simpler and more literal "not handsome" in Fusso (1) and Pevear/Volokhonsky (3). Gogol's "rocnoaaMH cpejHefi pyKH" (7) leads to Guerney/Fusso's "the fair-to-middlin' sort" (1), which fails to capture the underlying sense of class consciousness. The apostrophed form, which occurs elsewhere, also seems too casual for Gogol, even when expressing the colloquial spirit of his caricatures. Pevear/Volokhonsky offer us the better "of the middling sort" (3). The extrapo- lated fate of Chichikov's illusory serfs, if resettled near vivacious and presumably inebriated Ukraine, is described as "OHH H3OnIIbKTCAS H 6yIyT cTeJbKH" (155), a reference to the expres- sion "nbSH KaK cTeJIbKa", that is, "drunk as an insole." Guerney/Fusso describe that condition as "blind staggers" (151), closer than Pevear/Volokhonsky's "thoroughly pie-eyed" (156). Both translations transmit Gogol's humour exceedingly well. An example is the colorful argu- ment scene with Nozdrev, his extravagantly ostentatious manner contrasted with Chichikov's dignified and hopeless attempts to disguise the nature of his mission and save his skin. Similarly the painfully comical centerpiece, the jealous and competitive discussion between the two women "friends," is superbly rendered in both editions.</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 353 Gogol often mocks the pretentious French usage among the Russian aristocracy, motivated "of course out of a profound feeling of love for their native land." (Guerey/Fusso 179) Where Gogol has transliterated these French expressions into Cyrillic ("npe3eHTa6eJbHbI," "KOHTp-BHS3TOM"), Guerney/Fusso have appropriately included the French phrases (and inap- propriately added a few), while Pevear/Volokhonsky have inexplicably translated the phrases into English, thereby losing the context. A typically reverse anthropomorphic Gogolian image is this comically menacing metaphorical metamorphosis worthy of Kafka: "... KOMHaTy c TapaKaHaMH, BbIrJIsrbmasIBaomMH, KaK qepHOCJHB, H3 Bcex yrnoB .. ." Guerney/Fusso offer the guests a "bedroom with cockroaches peeking out of every corner like so many black plums . .." (2), while Pevear/Volokhonsky more correctly morph the beasts into prunes (4). One could hardly write a contemporary Gogal review without mention of the presumed sexual subtext. Some translators read what they will in or into a text, and others are less intrepid. For example, Sobakevich's proud declaration of refusal regarding consumption of oysters-"H 3Haio, Ha 'ITO ycTpnHa noxoxa" (98)-can be related to their supposed erotic symbolism and aphrodisiac qualities. Guerney/Fusso are willing to play along: "... an oys- ter's looks remind me too much of something else" (94). However, Pevear/Volokhonsky purify the text of innuendo: "I know what oysters are like" (98). A more questionable writer's block metaphor is employed, perhaps as a hidden testament to Gogol's ambiguous sexual orientation (discussed in Simon Karlinsky's The Sexual Labyrinth of Nikolai Gogol [Cam- bridge, 1976]) or simply his aversion to women. The author finds himself not up to the task of describing the women of the town of N: "iaxce cTpaHHo, coBceM He nojxIMaeTcs nepo." Guerney/Fusso take the joke in stride with "my quill absolutely refuses to rise" (154), while Pevear/Volokhonsky once again rescue the readers from any impure imaginings with: "I cannot lift the pen at all" (159). Gogol calls this work his no3Ma, a term of contentious interpretation: "B CImo pyccKyIO CBOso no3My" (183) is translated as "this Russian epic of his" (G/F 179) or "this Russian poem of his" (P/V 185), with the former probably closer to his intent. The Guerney/Fusso transla- tion, in fact, incarnates the spirit of an epic, while the Pevear/Volokhonsky version embodies the style of a novel. The climactic troika scene is Dead Soul's ultimate extended simile, simultaneously an idealization of the Russian spirit and a description of a rather amoral manipulator escaping justice. This passage exhibits many telling variances in interpretation. Gogol's terms "Pycb" idealistically unifies the faded glory of ancient Kyivan Rus' with the sprawling contemporary Russian empire. The translation of the term touches a sensitive nerve of unresolved historical and political debates-Guerney/Fusso offer "my Russia" (248), while Pevear/Volokhonsky use "Rus" (253). Further, Russia-Rus' is immortalized as "B TOH 3eMJne, HTO He JIIo6nT myTHTb." Guerney/Fusso translate this as "in that land that is not fond of doing things by halves" (248), literally far removed but nearer in sense than "in a land that cares not for jokes" (P/V 252), a description which Gogol's own writing adeptly refutes. Gogol only mentions "troika" once in the final paragraph, at its inception. Many translators readily assume this word to be the subject of the final lines. However, the closing subject seems to simultaneously embrace and subsume Rus', the troika, and even the song ("necHmo"). This all-encompassing ambiguity is utilized to grand effect (see Robert Maguire, Exploring Gogol [Stanford, 1994], 254). The line "H M'HTCS, BCs BIOXHOBeHHaS 6oroM!" is here over-interpreted by Guemey/ Fusso as ". . . the troika tears along, all-inspired by God!" (248), while Pevear/Volokhonsky do better with ". . . all inspired by God it rushes on!" (253). The translator becomes de facto interpreter, and must avoid rendering the abstract concrete, or vice versa. In summary, here we have two powerful and expressive translations of one of the great works of world literature. Would our complex Ukrainian-Russian author be proud? Or would Nabokov generously offer to burn these editions, if he were still in residence far above Cayuga's waters? Cast all doubts aside: these are two of the best translations of Nikolai</page><page sequence="4">354 Slavic and East European Journal Gogol's Dead Souls available. Susanne Fusso has updated a classic, significantly extending the life of Bernard Guilbert Guerney's translation. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have given us a stimulating and accessible contemporary version. Where the former represents the more poetic and grand intricacy of Art Nouveau, the latter offers us the clarity and cultivated simplicity of Art Deco. Both versions are deserving of our attention. The decision between the nearly baroque formal elegance of the past and the transparent directness of the modern idiom translates into the rather subjective question of which will bring us closer to the living soul of Gogol's text. Zenon M. Feszczak, University of Pennsylvania Wayne Dowler, An Unnecessary Man: Life of Apollon Grigor'ev. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1995. 286 pp., $55.00 (cloth) In this welcome book Wayne Dowler expands research begun in his ably-crafted study Dostoev- sky, Grigor'ev and Native Soil Conservatism (Toronto, 1982). But it is more than an amplifica- tion of the old. The author reviews the entire surviving record of one of Russia's highest-rated and least-read critics. His story begins at the end, that is, the 1990's when, as the author claims "Grigor'ev's time has come again." As Dowler shows time and again, Grigor'ev's ideas appear surprisingly modern, with his insight into psychological paradox and relations between the sexes, his doubts about the ontological stability of the individual, his insistence on the moral pre- rogative of the regional over the center and his investigation into the defining forces of myth. Readers will be tempted to begin with the "Epilogue," which neatly retails the history of the readings and, at times deliberate misreadings, of Grigor'ev's work. Dowler contrasts the salient features of Grigor'ev's thought with that of his better known opponents, and in doing so provides a sort of primer on organic criticism, its friends and foes. It is highly recommended reading for undergraduates, graduate students and the non-specialist. It is the well-told story of Grigor'ev's dissipated and incendiary career that makes this book especially fine reading for the specialist. Dowler is at his very best when marshaling details from dozens of biographical sources: letters, anecdotes, memoirs, external evidence from published records. The chapter on Grigor'ev's year-long stay in Italy in 1857-1858, a crucial one for the evolution of organic criticism, is exemplary. Though Grigor'ev lost or destroyed the major programmatic piece he was working on during this year, Dowler reconstructs the critic's thought, avoiding speculation, meticulously documenting evidence, providing back- ground when needed and making telling synthetic statements that never smack of the lapidary. Along the way we see all the "anthology" anecdotes that have made Grigor'ev's colorful life rather better known than his provocative, often brilliant criticism. There is Grigor'ev after a night of "orgies and all sorts of nasty things" on his knees at the Louvre before the Venus de Milo, praying she send him " 'a woman who would be a priestess' and not a 'commercial voluptuary' " (130). Here as elsewhere Dowler maintains control of the narrative, turning the melodrama and even bathos to the main task of uncovering the consistencies in Grigor'ev's thought. With a sure eye for the idiosyncrasies of Grigor'ev's character, Dowler makes masterful use of the growing body of materials published starting in the 1960's by astute (and courageous) scholars of the period, like B. F. Egorov. No critic could have written for as many different journals possessed of as widely varying programs as did Grigor'ev. Dowler recounts his participation in at least sixteen periodicals in a career spanning something just over twenty years, among them Pogodin's ostensibly Slavophile Moskvitianin, the journals Epokha and Vremia of the Dostoevsky brothers, and even Contemporary in the years when at the same</page></plain_text>
