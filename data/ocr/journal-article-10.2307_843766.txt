<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW Theory, Analysis and Meaning in Music, ed. Anthony Pople (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), xiv, 226 pages. REVIEWER Philip Rupprecht Anthony Pople's stimulating symposium comes at a time of widespread debate within musicology over broad disciplinary issues such as the rela- tionship of History and Theory, the relevance of socio-cultural con- structs-gender, sexuality, ethnicity-to the production and reception of musical artworks, and the defensibility of a split between high and low art.' At such a historical moment, the field of reference defined by the first two terms of Pople's title-"Theory" and "Analysis"-appears less clear than it might have in the past, while an appeal to music's potential seman- tic aspect-to be retrieved, in some cases, by an outright rejection of for- malist analysis, and even the practice of close reading-has given the third term, "Meaning," a new aura of respectability. Pople, in his editorial Preface, cites "a paradigm shift of major pro- portions" (ix) in the realm of theory and analysis as the catalyst for this volume of eleven essays, eight by British writers. As an index of the extent of this shift, he mentions the contrasts in tone and methodology between Allen Forte's 1978 monograph, The Harmonic Organization of The Rite of Spring-"analysis in order to demonstrate a theory" (ix)- and Lawrence Kramer's 1990 volume, Music as Cultural Practice, 1800- 1900, whose essays typify a move away from structure-as-meaning towards "a kind of theory through which a range of possible meanings can be described, prescribed, or circumscribed" (x). On the face of it, then, Pople seems to be outlining a transformation of outlook familiar in other branches of the humanities, and general precedents are not hard to find. In the late 1970s, art history, for instance, moved beyond the bound- 157</page><page sequence="2">aries of formalist criticism, whose focus was the autonomy and self- sufficiency perceived to characterize Modernist art-especially painting and sculpture-in favor of "a history of art founded in the social and political milieus" (Stiles 1996, 4). For academic musicians, talk of a move away from aesthetic "autonomy" towards contextually defined meanings has a familiar ring. Still, Pople notes, the encounter of theory and analysis with "recent developments in intellectual history"-in par- ticular, a wide range of post-structuralist theories-has not entirely remade the disciplines beyond recognition: we remain, as theorists and analysts, committed to the "traditional concern with explanation and technical description" (x). Pople's assessment of the situation, circa 1994, is echoed in Derrick Puffett's provocatively-titled Music Analysis editorial "In Defence of Formalism": "There is no less need for precision, or exactitude, in analysis than there was before, for all the fancy new vocabulary. Analysis, in other words, needs to maintain its own internal logic." (Puffett 1994, 4). The writers Pople has assembled here are by no means averse to a swift deconstruction of the binarism underlying Puffett's reference to "internal logic" in analysis and theory; deconstructive thinking, in particular that of Derrida and de Man, directly informs several chapters. At the same time, though, Pople's theorists and analysts appear largely to have re- sisted the potentially dizzying regress of such self-reflexive reasoning; one senses throughout an ongoing commitment to the practical business of analysis-a belief in dealing with events at the level of the musical "surface," albeit with a heightened critical awareness of the ideological and linguistic constructions encapsulated by such a notion. Pople's organization of this symposium into three aphoristically titled clusters-Languages, Decisions, Texts-makes clear that the eventful recent history of music theory and analysis escapes a reductive historio- graphic summary. The sequence moves from discussion of the verbal lan- guage of analysis and theory, to issues of practical methodology, to five close readings of individual works. I: Languages [F]or we all of us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act fatally on the strength of them. (George Eliot, Middlemarch) All three writers in this opening section focus explicit attention on the boundedness of critical responses to music in verbal language. Naomi Cumming critiques Roger Scruton's argument that all description of music is inherently metaphorical; Robert Snarrenberg chronicles con- ceptual distinctions arising from the translation of Schenker's highly 158</page><page sequence="3">poeticized German to a cooler, more scientific-sounding North American English; Marion A. Guck challenges Babbitt's influential plea for self- consciously objective description of music, by demonstrating that those same poetic metaphors can bear very precise analytic reactions to a musi- cal argument. Discussion of the relationship of music and language must encounter, sooner rather than later, the issue of metaphor. Naomi Cumming's chap- ter-"Metaphor in Roger Scruton's Aesthetics of Music"-offers a valu- able opening to this collection in its reasoned and compelling critique of Scruton's view that we describe music's expressive content through metaphor in a way distinct from our descriptions of other objects in the material world (Scruton 1974; 1983). Responding to Hanslick's claim that music evokes emotion, but without reference to anything outside itself, Scruton argues that musical expression engages the listener's "intentional" understanding, rather than any more "scientific" under- standing of its material or acoustical aspects. For Scruton, the apprehen- sion of music's most basic domains of space and motion-moving between higher and lower pitches in a melody line, say-invokes "a com- plex system of metaphor, which is the true description of no material fact" (Scruton 1983 cited 7). The argument turns on Scruton's opposition of metaphor and fact, with metaphor an act of understanding posited, as Cumming says, on a verbal transference "from one realm of experience to another" (7), such that the speaker senses an incongruity between literal and figurative language. Problematic in Scruton's argument is an empiricist faith in the possibil- ity of rigorously separating literal description of the material world from the incursion of a more subjective description reflecting the contamina- tion of categories of cognition; in Scruton's example (cited p. 8), the metaphorical phrase "an angry sore" is replaced with more literal refer- ence to "an inflamed.., infection of the skin." Cumming begins her re- sponse by invoking Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) argument against any rigorous separation of the literal and figurative; no descriptive language can ever escape the figuring of reality by substituting one term for an- other (Scruton's "inflamed" has its own metaphorical imagery). While Scruton's initial formulations seem to reflect an inadequate def- inition of metaphor itself, Cumming's broader concern is with the place of a literal/metaphorical distinction in cognition of music's basic cate- gories. Scruton's claim that space and motion are more metaphorical constructs in music than in other spheres of experience is quickly coun- tered-the spatial implications of a musical scale are no more or less real, Cumming notes, than the mathematical concept of a 2-D measure space-in order to get at the "much higher level of interpretive activity" (13) based on the perception of aspects of an object. The observer of 159</page><page sequence="4">Wittgenstein's famous duck/rabbit figure must exert conscious imagina- tive control over the basic act of cognition, "a case of seeing X as Y" (15). Still, Cumming notes, acts of musical perception occur at various levels: there is an obvious distinction, that is, between interpretations (choosing to describe a passage in which "the notes are dancing," e.g.) and statements that reflect more literal beliefs within a given community ("in this context the chord is dissonant and requires resolution," 19). Cumming's larger point is that the distinction between literal and meta- phorical is negotiated within a given linguistic community. In music the- ory, for instance, the concept of space may be approached via quite dis- tinct systemic metaphors. Schenker, after Kant, considers space an a priori category deriving from intuitive bodily awareness (23); in the Gestaltist theories of Meyer and Narmour, though, a comparable basis for describing pitch motion emphasizes the more visually oriented con- cept of pattern recognition and the temporally defined phenomenon of expectation thwarted. Cumming's thoughtful critique of Scruton is moti- vated less by his specific music-theoretical references-which show an incomplete grasp of basic concepts-than by "his attempt to compare the grounding of judgements about structural content (through the analysis of 'harmony, melody and rhythm') with the grounding of judgements about expressive content" (27). The discovery that metaphor is active at the level of a theoretical system "must lead the theorist/analyst to eschew holding any dogmatic stance about the intrinsic objectivity of these the- ories" (27). For Cumming, the supposed distinction between objective and subjective responses to musical works depends very much on the degree to which a system's conceptual metaphors are made explicit to others. By placing metaphor within its social context, Cumming's project prefigures central motifs in the other two chapters on language. Robert Snarrenberg's "Competing Myths: The American Abandon- ment of Schenker's Organicism" begins, almost uncannily, as the precise embodiment of a line of action proposed by Cumming (23): One way of gaining a new perspective on current theoretical discourse is to retrieve the metaphorical origins of words which are accepted within a specialized system (such as that of Schenkerian theory) as being literal, and thus to gain access to conceptual frameworks which have influenced the building of the theory. Snarrenberg's case-study approach nicely complements the broader philo- sophical tone of Cumming's discussion, and he begins with a detailed sur- vey of Schenker's metaphors of procreation, from early appearances in the essay "Der Geist der musikalischen Technik" (1895) all the way through to Derfreie Satz, some forty years later. Taking Rothstein's (1986) analy- sis of Schenker's "Americanization" as a starting-point, he uncovers the conceptual framework inscribed in Schenker's original German language, 160</page><page sequence="5">a network of ideas whose "aesthetic commitments" were altered, Snar- renberg claims, in their translation and popularization by American theo- rists (30). The reading of Schenker's rhetoric is illuminating and persua- sive, and thus provides a useful contribution to our understanding of Schenker's organicism, "a dynamic balance between the countervailing forces of unity and growth," in Nadine Hubbs's working definition (1991, 143). While it is the composer's imagination (die Phantasie), in Schenker's early writings, that "gives birth" (hervorbringt) to melodic con- tent, music's organicism is not botanical in any simple way, for its causal- ity is the product of compositional artifice, not Nature. In Schenker's later writings, organic metaphors take on a personalizing form, relating musi- cal activities directly to human subjectivity; in Derfreie Satz, then, one reads that "the octave, fifth, and third of the overtone series are an organic function of the tone as subject just as man's drives are organic" (trans. cited 42).2 In the second half of his chapter, Snarrenberg turns to what he dubs "the American Abandonment" of the organic in Schenker. Felix Salzer's 1952 text, Structural Hearing, gives evidence of a basic misconstrual of Schenker's thinking by his own pupil: this is Salzer's tendency, in Leonard Meyer's words, "to treat a musical composition as a thing instead of as a process which gives rise to a dynamic experience" (cited 49). Fleshing out a picture of Schenker's American reception in the 1950s, Snarrenberg depicts Babbitt's reinscription, in his review (1952) of Salzer's text, of Schenkerian rhetoric in the language of the hard sciences, the result for present-day Schenkerians being a field of two competing myths, in "the contrasting images of procreation and natural science" (52). Snarren- berg's overall claim here, that "each image is a source that funds a reper- tory of analytical fictions" (52), asserts the system-level function of meta- phoric concepts remarked by Cumming. Snarrenberg equates an abandonment of authentically Schenkerian thinking with the rise of a newly scientific image of the analyst in the role of master scientist,3 and, more specifically, with a "recast[ing of] the ana- lytical enterprise in terms of 'reduction' " (54). Allen Forte's 1959 essay, "Schenker's Conception of Musical Structure" (Forte 1977), in particu- lar, is singled out for blame here. This is a questionable reading of Forte's position, however,4 and it sits uncomfortably with the evidence of Schen- ker's own writings, which often stress-as Snarrenberg himself acknowl- edges-awareness of a dialectical interplay of generative analyses- elaborations of the Ursatz-and reductive thinking, a balance necessary to composer and analyst alike. The point has a theoretical resonance far beyond its importance for present-day Schenkerian analysis; as Anthony Pople notes, the dialectical interplay between generative and reductive forces constitutes an inevitable tension between top-down and bottom-up processing within hierarchic systems (110-11). 161</page><page sequence="6">The unmarked opposition in Snarrenberg's discussion is between a reception of Schenker's theory that emphasizes its philosophical traits, an approach that has gained ground recently (Korsyn 1988), and one that treats the theory as a practical tool for teaching tonal analysis-as a ped- agogical system, in fact. Reading the language of Forte's 1959 essay, Snarrenberg understates its pedagogical impulse. As Rothstein (1990, 199) notes, the article "introduced many readers to Schenker's basic con- cepts for the first time"; its summary of Schenker's theory was directed, in the first place, to professional theorists in their role as college teachers (a later segment of the article focuses explicitly on "Improving Theory Instruction"). Reduction, as Proctor and Riggins (1988, 108) point out, particularly at the foreground level, reflects a "pedagogical... posture," both in Derfreie Satz itself, and in the 1982 Forte-Gilbert textbook.5 A closer account of the pedagogical dimension within the complex history of Schenker's American reception-the obvious contrast between the domestic Viennese setting for Schenker's private teaching and the insti- tutional environment common to North American pedagogy-may be all that is missing from Snarrenberg's reception history.6 Marion A. Guck's rhythmically offbeat title, "Rehabilitating the Incor- rigible," plays on the words of Milton Babbitt, in particular his rejection, in three influential papers of the 1960s, of "incorrigible personal state- ment" in favor of "'scientific' language" (cited 58-59) and methods in music theory and analysis.7 Guck's recent work (Guck 1994) draws at- tention to the rhetorical aspect of all analytical writing, and the present paper begins by noting a disparity between Babbitt's theoretical dis- course, founded on the ideal of a "deductively interrelated system of laws" (Babbitt 1961, 4; cited 59, n. 9), and the more loosely empirical style of his own analyses. Here, Guck observes, Babbitt's main concern is with gathering valid evidence to support observations, evidence that will, in his words, "extend and enrich [the listener's] perceptive powers by making listening more efficient and meaningful... granting additional significance to all degrees of musical phenomena" (Babbitt 1952, 261; cited 62). Guck's overview of Babbitt's aesthetic suggests that his requirements for analysis need not exclude a more metaphorical and poetic approach to describing musical events. By way of demonstration, her reading of the slow movement of Mozart's G-minor Symphony ingeniously narrates the fate of the chromatic pitch-class Cb (first heard in m. 2) using the metaphor of "a rather daring immigrant adjusting to an alien culture" (67), in this case the diatonic home key of Eb major. As Guck shows, an analysis "modelled in terms of patterns in other domains of experience" (68) can be just as precise in its reference to the events of a piece-wit- ness her anthropomorphic reference to Cb's "tendency to draw attention to itself" in mm. 44-6 and m. 53 (69)-while downplaying her reliance 162</page><page sequence="7">on conventional theoretic terms; she frequently cites the prolongational harmonic function of specific bars, while avoiding actual voice-leading sketches. Within such an analysis, Guck argues, a fictional ascription, such as calling the Cbs of m. 53 "portentuous," acquires a rich and pre- cise analytical meaning. Guck's analysis sheds light on the insecurity of the supposed distinc- tion between formal and informal descriptions of musical events. The re- minder that analysis involves an intersubjective exchange of shared meanings is crucial to her separation of the formal and empirical strands of Babbitt's thought, and to an evaluation of her own analysis, which still depends, in its own unfolding of a metaphorical ethnic tale, on Schenker- ian notions of long-range dissonance in tonal works. Recalling the con- tributions by Cumming and Snarrenberg in this section on languages, one might say, adapting Anthony Pople's model of heterarchic interaction in listening (see below), that meaning is metaphorical, in that it suggests itself to the listener precisely at the moment of intersection of two incon- gruous languages. For Guck's listener, at least, the meaningful concep- tual leap is between the twin fictions of pitch-class equivalence, a formal conceit, and the more poetic world of the immigrant's tale. II: Decisions The means must be asked what the end is. Bertolt Brecht (cited Stiles 1996, 6) Pople's inter-title, Decisions, announces a trio of papers with a more- or-less common theme, "the pragmatics of the theory/analysis interface" (Preface, xi). In a general sense, this section picks up the contrast noted by Guck of Babbitt, between theory and action, systematic thought and its specific application to the peculiarities of actual pieces. Thus all three writers are concerned with what analysts are doing these days with estab- lished theoretical tools, and how their activities affect others. This focus on the broadly political aspect of studying music in any organized way seems timely, at least if one takes seriously Charles Rosen's opinion that "ideally, musicologists ought to write for listeners and performers" (Rosen 1994, 55). Kofi Agawu's "Ambiguity in Tonal Music: A Preliminary Study" chal- lenges the fashionability, in recent years, of analytic approaches that favor ambiguity as an organizing premise. Agawu concurs with the sense of paradigm shift advanced in Pople's preface, noting a turn towards lit- erary notions of "plurisignification, indeterminacy and undecidability" during "a period in which music's multiple meanings or inherent ambi- guities dictate the terms of theory and analysis" (87). The problem here, 163</page><page sequence="8">Agawu boldly claims, "is that the concept of ambiguity is meaningless within the confines of an explicit music theory" (88, italics original). Agawu does not attempt any general summary of the features of this newly ambivalent music theory (though his note 3 [88] lists ten publica- tions from the period 1966-91); rather, he begins by defining his terms. Ambiguity in music is comparable to grammatical ambiguity in natural language: it arises when "two (or more) meanings are comparably or equally plausible" (89); this is to be distinguished from mere vagueness, "indefiniteness in the meaning of a word, expression, or statement" (90, citing philosopher Anthony Flew). Agawu's suggestion here, that "music's apparent lack of a stable semantic dimension paradoxically undermines its potential for supporting vagueness" (90), focuses attention directly on musical meaning as a question of structure. Agawu now presents four examples, all from 19th-century works, of analyses invoking ambiguity in harmonic and metric parameters. A chord's function may be ambigu- ous at first-Schumann's "Am leuchtenden Sommermorgen" initially implies either V7 of B major/minor or the German sixth of Bb major/ minor-but there is an obvious context to be supplied, and the auditing process eventually results in a choice, based on retrospective interpreta- tion of the harmonic syntax, and the resolution of ambiguity in favor of the most plausible meaning. Metric ambiguity too, as at the opening of Mozart's G-minor Symphony (Agawu cites the analysis in Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983), entails a choice for the performers, who "at the mo- ment of execution...must decide one way or other and convey their interpretation with conviction" (98). Two remaining examples support Agawu's case against ambiguity as an analytic-theoretic concept, a case captured in the claim that "as soon as we enter into the details of an actual musical work, ambiguity recedes in our perception" (104). Agawu's readings of analyses by William Thomson and Carl Schachter focus on "the disambiguiting functions of theory" (99): while both analysts acknowledge ambiguity as an abstract possibility, neither convincingly shows "final-state awareness of ambiguity" (104) in works by Debussy and Chopin. My summary necessarily simplifies the subtlety and suggestiveness of Agawu's argument, but his own concluding proposition is usefully syn- optic: "in situations of competing meanings, the alternatives are always formed hierarchically, making all such situations decidable without deny- ing the existence of multiple meanings" (107). The evenhandedness of this formulation is hard to fault; still, there is an obvious hierarchy in Agawu's discussion, with ambiguity defined largely by its lack of theo- retical clarity. In critiquing received notions of ambiguity, Agawu con- sistently recognizes potentially ambiguous situations as legitimate ob- jects of the analytic approach, and as basic to music's expressive quality-in the common situation of "parametric non-congruence," e.g. 164</page><page sequence="9">(100-101). Theory, on the other hand, is treated exclusively as the agent of a final-state awareness. This strikes me as an overly limiting definition of theory, whose role appears distant from the dynamic aspect of struc- ture in a time-bound medium. A categorical separation of analysis and theory also seems contrary to the interaction of topical and contrapuntal- harmonic domains described in Agawu's earlier study of 18th-century works, where analytic discussion centers on a "region of play" integral to the "semiotic theory" (Agawu 1991: 24, 133). Agawu's lucid study of harmonic and metrical ambiguity raises impor- tant questions about the nature of such phenomena in its chosen, 19th- century repertory and, more provocatively, about the limits of what he calls "explicit music theory." If ambiguity is a broad category of human experience, and a common aspect of the listening experience, why must it remain, nonetheless, beyond theory? Agawu's answer is based, he acknowledges, on a stylistically limited sampling ("I have said nothing about ambiguity of form, textural ambiguity, timbral ambiguity, ambigu- ity in other tonal musics, and so on," 106-7), and one looks forward to closer studies of ambiguity in the areas he mentions. Formal ambiguity seems particularly intriguing as a facet of structure persisting beyond local context. The "false recapitulations" of Haydn's sonata forms-the first movements of the Quartets, Op. 64/4 and Op. 64/5, for example- are events whose ambiguity occupies the broadest structural span, that of the complete movement.8 Agawu's sense of ambiguity as a perennial fashion in analytic writing is a reminder that conceptual thought inevitably has its political context, one incisively sketched in Jonathan Dunsby's chapter on "Criteria of Correctness in Music Theory and Analysis." Dunsby is interested in methodologies that have attained a hegemonic status, in the sense that they provoke "genuine, informed antagonism" (78). Analysis provokes most disfavor, he suggests, when it is either over-determined, conveying far more than is actually perceived by the average listener, or-con- versely-when it is under-determined by a neglect of salient "empirical qualities of the music which are fully scrutable" (78). Polemical in tone and panoramic in conception, Dunsby's argument resists synoptic reduc- tion while touching quite briefly on issues that deserve fuller discussion in their own right. Referring to Robert Winter's recent presentation on CD-ROM technology of an analysis of Beethoven's Ninth, for example, Dunsby discerns "a new kind of relationality in our dealings with the musical score" (84). Such a "re-animation of the role of depiction in musical thought," he feels, inevitably draws music theory into the fields of cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Both areas are germane to Anthony Pople's chapter, "Systems and Strategies: Functions and Limits of Analysis." Pople offers valuable perspectives on the relationship between real- 165</page><page sequence="10">world experiences such as listening and the character of the theoretical systems we have devised as models. Pople locates all analytic thought on an axis between the poles of the critical-didactic (the results of deductive reasoning) and the personal-empirical (an outgrowth of inductive proc- esses). His own model of cognition plausibly suggests an interplay be- tween both modes of processing in actual listening: "the linear flow of reportage in listening is...a volatile mix of recognitions in different 'domains' and at different [hierarchic] 'levels"' (113). Both Dunsby and Pople stress the primacy of listening, and it is striking that both explore connections between systematic theory and music cognition, two areas of the discipline that do not always seem to be in regular communication. III: Texts Music is a world within itself / With a language we all understand (Stevie Wonder, "Sir Duke") The tendency, in the never-ending search for musical meaning, to look beyond the more-or-less autonomous sphere of internal structure, and out to the exterior world of material and social reality, is evident in all but one of the five analytical chapters in Pople's Part III. These meanings are no longer opaque or self-referential, but point to bodily gestures, to the fig- urative activity of language, to a precise psychological state, and to broadly defined cultural tendencies such as the experience of temporal- ity in post-industrial society. This broadly sketched shift in attitudes sug- gests a belated parallel with the retreat from hard-core theory in literary studies, and the renewed concern for the mimetic and referential compo- nent in language.9 Within music theory itself, Craig Ayrey's synoptic ref- erence to an "autonomist/referentialist debate" (133) well captures the atmosphere, if not the full intricacy, of the current scene.' Whether one views newly ecumenical approaches to musical meaning as a sign of life, or merely as a case of what Alan Street (1994, 267) diag- noses as the "interdisciplinary anxiety" within musicology, the new atmosphere does appear to be stimulating a self-consciousness about methodology. Both of the chapters on post-war figures, for instance- Alistair Williams's on Boulez's Rdpons, Jonathan Cross's on Birtwistle's Refrains and Choruses-share a concern to move beyond organicist no- tions of structural coherence towards newer models of part/whole inter- action. Cross, alluding briefly to a generalized "urge to fragmentation" (187) in Modernist culture, traces the simultaneity of juxtaposed Refrain and Chorus materials (respectively chordal and melodic in character) within a 23-bar excerpt from Birtwistle's score. Linear continuity here is achieved even while maintaining an overt textural dualism: "The music is...'directed' towards its conclusion, yet refrain and chorus remain 166</page><page sequence="11">opposed, held in a meaningful balance by this process" (193). In the pres- ent context, Cross's chapter stands alone in its avoidance of extra-musi- cal reference.1' Alistair Williams, on the other hand, situates his analyses of musical detail, from the outset, within a wider cultural-aesthetic milieu, one in which "the postmodernist emphasis on place, locale, and detail exerts itself in a renewed interest in surface configurations" (195). Repons creates its "profusion of surface phenomena" (196) by a spatialized inter- action between live solo/ensemble forces and the "vast resonating sound masses" (207) created by their electronic transformation and diffusion around the auditorium. Williams analyzes Boulez's treatment of sound objects via Walter Benjamin's idea of constellation-in Williams's sum- mary, an attempt "to explore the immanence of the object, to touch its otherness, by fracturing it and revealing its inner tensions without reduc- ing the object to self-sameness" (200)-but his reading is firmly grounded in close description of Boulez's soundscape (the burial of anchor pitches amid an aura of trill-figures, for instance). Williams's evocative analytical discussion proceeds in conventional terms (his comments include a chordal summary of pitch materials, e.g.), but is interwoven with allusive analogical references to post-structuralist notions of textuality: "Through its extensive tropes and elaborations, Repons exudes... an awareness of itself as text and of its own metaphor- ical procedures" (202). Here, and especially in the chapters by Robert Samuels, Craig Ayrey, and Alan Street, the emphasis is on getting post- structuralist thinking directly into the analytic act. Such thinking, as Robert Samuels suggests ("Music as Text: Mahler, Schumann and Issues in Analysis") involves an expanded concept of text, as "precisely that which designates things as outside itself" (153). In the first movement of Mahler's Fourth Symphony, the outside is intertextual (the conventions of other symphonic sonata forms, foregrounded at key points in Mahler's design). In Kreisleriana, the musical gestures point to an "irreducible corporeality" (161)-places where the effect is something akin to a stretch, or a curling up. Here, and in the Mahler example, Samuels' well- heard comments reach beyond the domains of more systematic styles of music-analytic discourse; indeed, his comments home in on precisely those aspects of the text, conventionally defined, that elude more formal description. The format of Street's and Ayrey's chapters is symptomatic, for both analysts use metacritical reflection as a frame for close readings of spe- cific passages: from Schoenberg's Opp. 10 and 16 (Street); and the first 17 bars of Debussy's Pellias (Ayrey). And while, in the case of narrative theory, Street's critique comes in response to a substantial body of narra- tological work on music (a reflection of music's inherent sequentiality), musicological awareness of deconstructive thinking, as Ayrey notes, has so far yielded relatively few analytic applications. 167</page><page sequence="12">Ayrey's closely detailed view of Debussy's syntax ("Debussy's Sig- nificant Connections: Metaphor and Metonymy in Analytical Method") takes its cue from the deconstruction of binary logic. Ayrey follows Der- rida's critique of Levi-Strauss, in understanding structure itself as a dis- cursive field, one that admits an unending play of substitutions and dis- placements. For Ayrey, the musical value of this critique comes by recognizing-in terms familiar from Cross's and Williams's account of Modernism-that "music theory is often oblivious to... opposition itself [as] a relation, a mode of connection between disparate units" (129). The argument shifts to the rhetorical master tropes of metaphor and meton- ymy, exemplified in Jakobson's example (described on 136-37), which may be summarized in diagram form: metaphor-similarity-paradigmatic connections hut &gt; den metonymy- contiguity- syntagmatic connections thatch Ayrey's main concern is with the pervasive tension between meta- phoric relations of similarity and the metonymic axis of contiguity, an argument he furthers with a closely argued critique of Nicholas Ruwet's classic analysis of Debussy's Pellias Prelude according to its constituent melodic units (Ruwet 1972).12 Focusing mainly on melodic aspects of the orchestral texture, Ayrey draws out the complexity of dialectical interaction between static and processive aspects of structure -between variation of existing shapes and the oppositionality of new-sounding material. Where Ruwet's graphic chart emphasizes the metaphoric cast of mm. 1-15, depicted as a horizontal succession of distinct paradigms, Ayrey's revision stresses similar rhythmic articulation ("second beat emphasis," 145) as a path of contiguity within the same paragraph, here expressed as positional similarity in the vertical axis. Ayrey offers real insights into Debussy's style for the reader who follows what is often a densely pitched argument. His closing references to Debussy's "typically self-reflexive" melodic arabesques (150) might usefully have appeared earlier in the paper, as a way of reassuring readers of the quite tangible connection between a familiar musical trait and the elaborate metacriti- cal apparatus of the main discussion. I do not wish to detract from the most welcome feature of Ayrey's chapter: his serious engagement with the central strands of post-war literary-philosophical thinking (Barthes, de Man, Derrida, are cited often) is balanced by a suitably sophisticated analytic approach (by turns, paradigmatic, linear, and set-theoretic) to 168</page><page sequence="13">Debussy's always-elusive musical surface. Theory may be in the midst of a paradigm shift; still, Ayrey says, we can't simply abandon the work of analysis. I sense this commitment to structural analysis as the prerequi- site of interpretation echoed often in Pople's symposium; amusingly, two writers make the point in near-identical metaphorical terms ("broadening of focus need not throw out the baby of insight... with the bathwater of misappropriated 'method,'" 122; "we must take care not to throw away the analytical baby with the theoretical bathwater," 194), a coincidence I take as a sign of emerging consensus, albeit sketchy. The merits and frail- ties of structural analysis are likewise very much on the mind of my final author. Alan Street's contribution, "The Obbligato Recitative: Narrative and Schoenberg's Five Orchestral Pieces, Op. 16"-apart from offering the most elegantly fashioned prose in the symposium-stands out for its ini- tial commitment to exploring the one realm conspicuously absent from Pople's title: history. Where Williams and Cross, for instance, refer only in passing to the position of their chosen works within respective oeu- vres-Repons (mid 1980s) is later Boulez; Refrains and Choruses (1957) very early Birtwistle -Street's textual reading opens with conventional chronology, documenting the genesis of the Op. 16 pieces in mid-1909, and the addition, in 1912, of descriptive titles.13 Concerned with their potential programmatic origin, Street builds up a well-rounded picture of Schoenberg's view of text-music relations, in a synthetic argument (draw- ing on work of Dahlhaus, Walter Bailey, and Peter Franklin, among oth- ers) that seemingly rules out the prospect of a narrative analysis. At this point, however, Street swerves away from the "problematic level of autho- rial intent" (169) towards narrative as a primary critical drive, "hermeneu- tic in intention, claiming to retrace an event in order to make it available to consciousness" (Peter Brooks, cited 170). The reading here becomes "psychobiographical" (175): Street is now "reading for the plot" (a point made by his borrowing of Brooks's well- known title as a section heading). Interpreting the Op. 16 titles anew, in a bid to dramatize their "allegorical significance" (171), Street draws attention first to Schoenberg's rapid technical evolution; to the stylistic- generic allusion of No. 5 (a Ldndler); and, lastly, in most detail, to possi- ble connections between the crisis in Schoenberg's domestic situation (an echt-Viennese erotic triangle) and the proliferation of pitch-name ciphers inscribed in the score itself. Annotated score citations show hid- den references to the composer, "mAtHilDE" and her lover, "riCHArD," and pitch-class-specific Tristan-chord echoes, connections linking Op. 16 to both the Op. 10 Quartet-with its more famous public quotation of "Ach, du lieber Augustin"-and the Op. 15 Georgelieder. And here the narrative stops in its tracks. For narrative, Street recalls, is an all too human capitulation, via story and discourse, to the seductions of a "mys- 169</page><page sequence="14">tified desire for meaning" (180). "There can be little value in an inter- pretation which blindly treats any work as a superficial surface trace for a more 'significant' authorial neurosis" (181), nor can one easily speak of narrativity in instrumental music; as Abbate and Nattiez have argued, it lacks the discursive distance needed to tell stories, rather than simply to mime actions. How does one respond to such self-critique, pitched as it is in that "mood of negative assurance" Paul de Man held as the cardinal trait of literary language, and typical of deconstruction itself as a practice of reading that "treats any position, theme, origin, or end as a construction and analyzes the discursive forces that produce it" (Culler 1982: 257, 259)? Might one draw attention, for instance, to the inherent secrecy of Street's preferred leading players? The pitch-class ciphers he quotes, for instance, even those that form part of a Hauptstimme within the contra- puntal web, seduce the eye more than the ear (and even listeners with absolute pitch will have trouble with unordered chordal collections and the enharmonicity of the German notes As and Gis). I raise the issue of aural salience not in order to discredit the evidence--Schoenberg's well- known numerological fascinations warn against the attempt-but rather to stress the distinction between the referential traces in Op. 16 and more directly audible pitch-specific allusions to Tristan concluding Op. 15, No. 1 (analogues to the liquid imagery of the song's poetic text).14 Street's argument invites response less at the level of specific analytic detail-his hermeneutical readings are scrupulously documented and subtly done-but rather as an instance of the "systematic reflection on the conditions of theoretical possibility" that he elsewhere cites as a pos- itive outgrowth of the ongoing intellectual ferment within musicology (Street 1992, 115). His title, after all, is carefully formulated to highlight what he calls "the inevitable divide which separates all modes of commentary from composition" (183); Street writes of "Narrative and Schoenberg ..." (emphasis added) rather than of anything more intrinsic. In this context, the self-contradiction of Schoenberg's own title, "The Obbligato Recitative" (fusing the freely dramatic and the binding), itself embodies the limits of all interpretation. The titular combination of elo- quence and secrecy-a wordless recitative--stands as a reminder that a title might attract the critical gaze, without ever halting the endless me- tonymy of interpretation, the "interplay of form and desire which passes reciprocally between text and reader" (182). A return to the rhetoric of titles brings me full-circle. Street's contri- bution, and indeed all eleven within the symposium, bear out Pople's suggestion that the search for musical meaning will always be "a journey rather than a destination" (xi); in the case of Schoenberg's Op. 16 pieces, the composer's titles may be of less interest than his own urge to keep changing them. This volume does give plenty of evidence of Kuhnian 170</page><page sequence="15">paradigm shift-a transformation in "the entire constellation of beliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared by the members of a given commu- nity" (Kuhn 1970, 175). What it offers too is the firm conviction that for musical scholars of all stripes, theory and analysis remain central to that constellation, and that this is not the time to get out. NOTES 1. Recent perspectives on the theory/history relationship include Korsyn 1993 and Hatch-Bernstein 1993; on musical construction of gender, see especially Solie 1993; on the relationship of musical and verbal meanings, see Scher 1992; on the breakdown of a "high-low" cultural split in 20th-century music, see Watkins 1994; Subotnik 1991 gives a more theoretical overview of the same phenomenon; for a theoretically informed response to popular musics see Forte 1995, Kowalke 1995. 2. It is unfortunate, in a discussion so focused on shades of figurative meaning in lan- guage, that more of Schenker's original German prose is not given following the translated quotations. Only occasionally (in notes 10 and 48, for example) is the reader given the opportunity to directly compare Snarrenberg's translations with Schenker's own German phraseology. 3. Snarrenberg acknowledges the influence of Marion Guck's recent work (Guck 1994) in his reading of the rhetorical dimension in analysts' language. 4. Forte's essay early on notes clearly that the vertical alignment of Schenker's struc- tural levels is designed "to show how the three levels interact," and that the sketches "can be read in several directions" (Forte 1977, 10). Forte's discussion also points to a distinction between reduction as a component of making analytic sketches (Forte 1977, 18-19), and the more fluid interaction of levels essential to the in- terpretative phase of the analysis. Forte's exposition of the Schumann song analy- sis (12-17), for instance, proceeds from background to foreground, emphasizing thereby the procreative in Schenker, an expansion of each level through prolonga- tion. Snarrenberg's assertion that Forte "even attributes [the] notion of reduction to Schenker" (55) oversimplifies; this ignores Forte's well-documented remarks, later in the essay (1977, 18-19), on parallels between Schenkerian reduction and ear- lier theorists of diminution and figured bass such as Bernhard and Heinichen. In a note, Forte (1977, 36) stresses the absence, in Schenker's writings, of explicit com- ments on how to make a reduction. 5. In Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis, Forte and Gilbert present the notation of a foreground passage in rhythmic reduction-a concept they distinguish from ana- lytic notation-as a practical tool for the novice only: "The rhythmic reduction need only occur as a first step; for the more experienced it is a stage which can often be bypassed" (Forte and Gilbert 1982; 134-36; citation from 136). Both Forte and Gilbert (1982, 136) and Salzer and Schachter (in their 1969 textbook, Coun- terpoint in Composition) suggest that reduction is most directly useful in analysis of foreground events; its value as an approach to deeper levels of structure is not, however, ruled out: "The procedure of successive reduction becomes much more difficult when applied to the analysis of longer and more complex musical conti- 171</page><page sequence="16">nuities; but the basic principle remains the same." (Salzer and Schachter 1989, 128, emphasis added). 6. Snarrenberg (55) refers to Derfreie Satz, ?49: I recommend that everyone take the trouble to feel his way from the foreground to the middleground and background; he need only employ the familiar method of reducing more extensive diminutions, as taught in textbooks and schools. So he will arrive at shorter and shorter versions, and finally the shortest, the funda- mental structure! (Schenker 1979, 26). Snarrenberg reads the passage as a concession to novices; Forte (1977, 36) too detects sarcasm in the same passage. In distinguishing between the more theoretical approach ("essentially top- down") to Schenker's thought exemplified by Proctor-Riggins 1988, and the "bot- tom-up" orientation of a pedagogical applications, Pople (110) also cites from Der freie Satz, ?29, "The True Meaning of the forms of the fundamental structure": The concept of the fundamental structure... presents only the strictly logical precision in the relationship between simple tone-successions and more com- plex ones. Indeed, it shows this precision of relationship not only from the sim- ple to the more complex, but also in reverse, from the complex to the simple. It is an inevitable principle that all complexity and diversity arise from a single simple element rooted in the consciousness or the intuition. (Even instruction in the beginning classes of music schools rests upon this principle.) Thus, a sim- ple element lies at the back of every foreground. The secret of balance in music ultimately lies in the constant awareness of the transformation levels and the motion from foreground to background or the reverse. This awareness accom- panies the composer constantly; without it, every foreground would degenerate into chaos (Schenker 1979, 18; emphasis in the original). One striking link between the two passages-whether or not one reads irony- is Schenker's association of the motion between Schichten with existing pedagog- ical models of structural coherence. For thoughtful discussion of the practicalities of teaching Schenker's theory, see Beach 1983; for a theoretical assessment of its hierarchic dimensions, see Cohn and Dempster 1992. 7. See Brody 1993 for an interpretation of Babbitt's scientism as a response to the ideological situation of American intellectuals in the 1950s. 8. Such ambiguities are not resolvable by performance choices; they are, one might say, composed into the structure of events. For an overview of Haydn's recapitu- lation strategies, and specific comments on the Op. 64 quartets, see Rosen 1971, 73-78, 140-41. On the false recapitulation, see Webster 1980, 502. In the domain of harmony, states of uncertainty and undecidability are arguably more character- istic of post-tonal practice, where the syntax depends less on a clear-cut distinc- tion between consonant and dissonant intervals, and a concomitant sense of direc- tionality. 9. See, for example, the comments of J. Hillis Miller cited in Street 1994, 289. 10. Two recent critical perspectives on the distinction between music's contextual contingency and its claims to structural autonomy before the aesthetic observer are Galand 1995 and Taruskin 1995. 11. See however Cross 1994, for a fuller discussion of Birtwistle's musical language within the context of his approach to operatic drama. 172</page><page sequence="17">12.
