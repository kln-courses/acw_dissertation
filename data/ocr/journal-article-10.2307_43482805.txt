<plain_text><page sequence="1">European Decorative Arts and Sculpture One of a pair of wine coolers (seaux à bouteilles) France, St. Cloud factory, about 1730; soft-paste porcelain; h. 7 Va in. (18.1 cm.) diam. at rim 77/s in. (20 cm.) Gift of The F.W. Richmond Foundation in Honor of Frances and George Richmond. 1986.64, 65 The stylized and fanciful foliage, executed in low relief, that decorates this seau is known as chi- noiserie, a term that describes a range of motifs used by Europeans to suggest the exotic Far East. The decorative vocabulary of chinoiserie is rarely taken directly from Chinese works of art, but reflects instead the European notion of the Orient and its images. By contrast, the fashion for white porcelain was based specifically upon the wares produced in Fujian province in China. Highly valued in Europe, these white wares were copied successively by each of the major Euro- pean porcelain factories. The factory at St. Cloud was one of the first in France to produce soft-paste porcelain. Experi- ments began in the 1 670s and the factory was flourishing by the beginning of the eighteenth century. By 1710 the factory had a branch in Paris, but both factories closed in 1766, probably owing to the difficulties of competing with the Sèvres factory, which had been granted special privileges by Louis XV. The soft-paste porcelain produced at St. Cloud is characterized by a creamy white body, a thick glassy glaze, and when polychromed, by brilliant saturated colors. Louisa Courtauld and George Cowles (English, in partnership from 1768 until 1777) Argyll (sauce warmer) England, London, 1771-1772; silver; h. 11 in. (27.9 cm.), w. 7% in. (19.7 cm.), diam. 47/i6 in. (11.3 cm.) Theodora Wilbour Fund in memory of Charlotte Beebe Wilbour. 1985.807a-d This silver argyll was commissioned by Nathaniel Curzon, first baron Scarsdale (1726-1805), whose crest it bears. Curzon had just completed an extensive renovation of his home in Derbyshire, Kedleston Hall - an important work of the renowned architect and designer Robert Adam (1728-1792). The elegant neoclassical shape of this argyll is based on a Greek form, and reflects Lord Curzon's keen interest in classical antiquity. This argyll compliments three superbly engraved condiment vases in the Museum's collection by the same makers that were also commissioned by Lord Curzon for Kedleston Hall. Silver argylls, likely named for the third Duke of Argyll, were distinctly neoclassical objects, made primarily between 1765 and 1790. This example has an interior screw-in reservoir that contained hot water for warming gravy held in the outer chamber. Louisa Courtauld and George Cowles embraced the neoclassical style and produced works of extremely high quality and original design. This argyll is distinguished by the use of two twining serpents to form the handle and spout along with the standard neoclassical vocabulary of bead- work, acanthus, fluting, and paterae. Jean Mayodon (French, 1893-1967) Vase About 1925; stoneware; h. 127/s in. (32.7 cm.), diam. at rim 33/s in. (8.6 cm.); marks: signed on base in gold Gift of John P. Axelrod. 1 985.648 Jean Mayodon, a prominent artist of the Art Deco period, is best known for his tin-glazed earthen- ware and tiles. He turned to ceramic work about 1912, and first exhibited as an artist-potter at the Musée Galliera in 1919. His use of strong colors and in his subject matter - floral motifs, archers, dancers, and processions of animals - suggest a familiarity with Hindu and Persian art. His work may have also been influenced by that of André Metthey (1871-1920); both preferred earthen- ware and decorated their objects using slips, glazes, and gold in a similar, figurative style. While Mayodon was undoubtedly familiar with such technical works as Theodore Deck's La Faïence, his kiln design and firing techniques were highly innovative. Mayodon also created monumental ceramic sculptures, garden foun- tains and decorative panels, working in stone- ware, enamelled faïence, and at least on one occasion, in pâte de verre. He was artistic direc- tor of the Sèvres factory in the early 1 940s. This vase is handthrown stoneware, decorated in fields of textured and geometric patterns. The artist has used copper and cobalt lead glazes to produce the turquoise and deep blue colors. The extensive gilding has a veined effect characteris- tic of Mayodon's work. On either side of the vase two dancing female figures are depicted in low relief and painted schematically. The facial fea- tures of these dancers recall Picasso's neoclassi- cal figures of the 1 920s, and the exotic dress recalls the theatrical costumes designed by Léon Bakst for the Ballets Russes. The Mayodon vase is one of about 250 glass and ceramic objects of the 1 920s and 30s that have been donated to the Museum by John Axelrod. This important collection has significantly enhanced the Museum's holdings of twentieth- century decorative arts. 32</page><page sequence="2">Jacques Lipchitz (French, 1891-1973) Mantelpiece and andirons Paris, 1928: Mantelpiece: limestone; h. 18.3 in.

Upton, and Theodora Wilbour Fund in Memory of Zoë Wilbour, by exchange, and Gift of Charlotte F. and Irving W. Rabb. 1986.4-6 In 1928 the great Paris fashion designer and col- lector Jacques Doucet commissioned the Cubist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz to create this mantel- piece and andirons for his newly built house in Neuilly, a suburb of Paris. The house was designed to accommodate Doucet's important collection of twentieth-century art, which included Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, Matisse's Bocal aux Poissons Rouges, and sculp- tures by Max Ernst and Constantine Brancusi. Doucet commissioned a number of works for the house from contemporary artists, among them furniture by Clement Rousseau, carpets by Lur- cat, and a crystal door by Lalique. The Lipchitz mantelpiece and andirons were installed in the Cabinet d'Orient on the main floor. Lipchitz, who was born in Russia, had come to Paris to study in 1909. Through his association with such artists as Picasso, Brancusi, Nadelman, and Archipenko, he was introduced to primitive art and to Cubism, both of which had a profound influence on his sculptural style. In the decade between 1910 and 1 920 Lipchitz's work was figurative with abstract and geometric cubist forms. After the war he incorporated more organic and curvilinear shapes in his sculpture. The Doucet commission came at one of the most important and interesting moments in his career. The lintel relief of facing dogs, seen in profile with their legs bent ready to leap after their prey of overlapping birds is at once a study of cubistic abstract shapes and compressed organic move- ment. The elegant forms of the birds are repeated with variations in the gilt bronze and- irons. In his memoirs Lipchitz said, "These deco- rative works were done, frankly, as commissions to make a little money, but in every case I tried to realize them as completely as possible and in them, I think, one can see the development of certain ideas in my sculpture from cubism to a pattern of greater anthropomorphic freedom." 33</page></plain_text>
