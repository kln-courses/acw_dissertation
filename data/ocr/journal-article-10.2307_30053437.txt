<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOSTALGIA FOR THE EXOTIC: CREATING AN IMPERIAL ART IN LONDON, 1750-1793 Natasha Eaton Nostalgia is sadness without an object... Hostile to history and its invisible origins, and yet longing for an impossibly pure context of lived experience at a place of origin, nostalgia wears a distinctly utopian face, a face that turns towards a future-past... The realization of re-union imagined by the nostalgic is a narrative utopia that works only by virtue of its partiality, its lack of fixity and closure: nostalgia is the desire for desire. Susan Stewart, On Longing Between its status as a contagious disease that causes irreparable home- sickness, and as an ontological ground vis-a-vis which modern philosophy's turn to self-reflexivity was legitimated, nostalgia was also formative of imperial taste.1 This essay is concerned with the quotidian culture of late eighteenth-century Brit- ain, the evolution of an aesthetic of exoticism tied up with the trafficking of imag- ery from India and, implicated in all these, the emergence of imperialist nostalgia. It explores the metamorphosis of the status of the English East India Company (1600-1858) in 1765 from a favored trader to the sovereign of the Mughal suba of Bengal-encompassing the three prosperous provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.2 I contend that both nostalgia and the exotic were dramatically trans- formed by the new demands imposed by post-Plassey British imperialism. To- gether, they contributed to the making of a modern and necessarily Creole British taste, negotiating a space between the "mercantile fetish," curiosity, the idol and Natasha Eaton is Lecturer in the Department of Art History at the University College Lon- don.

The eccentric aesthetic of the exotic veered uncertainly between a tentative acceptance of the art of the "other" and an increasingly chau- vinistic insularity. I will explore the hypothesis as to whether these late-eighteenth century mutations in "greater Britain" were productive of a specifically colonial nostalgia-a certain longing for the splendor of the Mughal courtly artifacts that were believed to be vanishing or endangered under a predatory colonialism. I begin by unpacking the contours of the conflictual (symbolic) economy of the imperial exotic and the competing ideas that went into its making. A con- venient entry point is the metropolitan fashion for Mughal miniatures and Indian glass paintings and the orchestrated fantasies espoused by the collectors and the traders around these "hybrid" oriental artifacts. The latter sections of the essay focus on western representations of India, including an exploration of the aes- thetic treatises that tried to engage with, and valorize the colonial artifacts in certain ways. British artists painted the earliest colonial representations of India and fashioned an early imperial aesthetic, but they had to negotiate, of necessity, with metropolitan ideas of the exotic already obsessed with Indian images. THE EXOTIC ON THE THRESHOLD OF IMPERIALISM Central to the changing artistic perceptions was the idea of the exotic. Its etymology-on/in the "outside" (exo)-fixes the exotic on the threshold between home and the world, the oikos and the polis. It elicits more complex perceptions of Otherness than what is warranted by the dialectic of polis and ethnos.3 In a fascinating recent discussion on collecting, the exotic competes with its seemingly binary opposite, nostalgia, a painful state (algia), rooted in the desire for home (nostos).4 Nostalgia as modern, metaphorical homelessness functions simulta- neously as Western Europe's desire to return to a primordial "home" and as a strategy for casting non-Europeans as spatially and temporally distant Others.s The affective tension of juggling the (structured) binary opposites-nostalgia and the exotic-in the same economy of desire could not be sustained without a cer- tain libidinal expenditure: The sensation evoked by the presence of a rare, bizarre foreign entity specifically transcended it to produce a singular, unusual atmosphere .... This nostalgia, this yearning for what remains funda- mentally unknown and beyond real experience is exaggerated through the explicit contrast drawn. . . between a specific, appropriable, a rare foreign object and a feeling generated from and indeed generating a complex coordination of individual elements into a distinct whole that surpassed its constitutive parts. (Stewart, 44) This modernist nostalgia requires the exotic to stimulate desire for a primal "at oneness" with a pre-reflexive self, a return to a mythical memory (as opposed to History) and a certain empathy for timeless yet fragile primitive cultures-what Schiller called "the customs of country folk and the primitive world."6 The alter- ity of the exotic enables escape from western modernity's expectation of progress. But was this really the case "with the eighteenth-century commercial "exotic," consisting in Chinese porcelain, Indian chintz or Mughal courtly miniatures that underpinned the British public's everyday understanding of the materiality of the exotic in their lives?"7 228</page><page sequence="3">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic 229 In spite of its significance to economic and cultural monopolies, studies of the "Enlightenment exotic" have sidelined imperialism. Even those who posi- tion the exotic within the discourse of Orientalism, privilege the Ottoman Em- pire, China and the Pacific-heterotopic places which lay beyond colonialism's direct, instrumentalist governmentalization projects.8 It is as if the exotic always predates the imperial. Perhaps there are specific reasons for assuming this posi- tion, because tracking the exotic involves probing creolized networks of funding, negotiations with foreign dealers, artists and craftsmen.9 Patterns designed for the use of Indian weavers by the Company for export to Britain were adapted and modified by the former and when exported "home," these Creole, hybrid cotton prints (chintz) proved to be enduringly popular in Europe as markers of "In- dia."10 Accelerating overseas trade from the 1750s, especially in India, positioned the exotic and its objects (spices, opium, idols and images) ambivalently between exploration and imperialism, as the major driving force for both commercial monopolies and other forms of colonization.'1 As Maxine Berg suggests, import- ing oriental luxuries influenced shaped domestic market development and pro- duction techniques. British artisans attempted to mimic the appearance of eastern things if never their technologies of manufacture (108). In this sense Indian ob- jects acted as a driving force behind industrialization. But at the same time they became the subject of heated debates of the pernicious and beneficent effects of oriental, and in particular Indian, luxury. This included Mughal pictures: "ex- quisite paintings . .. [lead] at length [to] the sloth, luxury and effeminacy of the emperors and the people."'12 Despite these urgent concerns, the problematic, ambiguous inscription of the exotic has forced it to the margins of the art history of eighteenth-century British taste in London and India.13 According to this literature, once upon a time, overseas East India Company officers and officials wished to mimic the life of brahmins or rajahs.14 Desiring and acquiring Mughal images and Hindu icons are presented as eccentric, exclusively "nabob" activities that took place outside Britain, epitomized by the most prolific Orientalist connoisseur, the ambassador and banker Richard Johnson. He wrote in his correspondence with the Compa- ny's Directors: "[Mine is] a numerous collection greatly contributing to the clear- er understanding of the history and religion of that important country of which a larger portion is now under the sovereignty of the Company."'5 The flipside of the metropolitan literature is a sly censure of Indian images in metropolitan soci- ety, which were exclusively associated with the colonial nouveaux riches, despised by British connoisseurs and men and women who possessed "real" taste based on class distinctions materialized through classical sculpture and European old mas- ters. In this account, even so-called cosmopolitan, enlightened men who were otherwise anxious to explore and collect the world, sneered at the taste of colo- nial "nabobs." Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society and traveler on Cook's first voyage of the Pacific (1768-1772), complained, "I was obliged to admire drawers full of Indian weapons, fly flapper pictures of the nabob" (Davis, 163). At its best, the colonial exotic signifies a bourgeois (vulgar and commercial) taste set against the culture of politeness and virtue preached by Anthony Ashley Cooper (the Earl of Shaftesbury) and Sir Joshua Reynolds (President of the Royal Academy; see Allen).'6</page><page sequence="4">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 David L. Porter's work on the "aesthetic of exoticism" suggests that we widen the frame from taste-as-distinction which favors Italian, French or British art, in order to foreground the exotic. The ambivalence of the exotic is what interests me here, poised between the pernicious or beneficent effects of "Asiatic Luxury," the fashionable or the archaic, the classical or the vulgar.17 Oscillating between curios, fine art, or even fetishes, Indian miniatures and glass pictures "defied classification" to elicit wonder and enchantment through their "eerie an- imation."18 The discourse of mercantilism frequently dubbed these exotic objects "rarities" to be valued for their singularity and tangible, material entanglement of Britain with other belief systems.19 There was a proliferation of object narra- tives (exemplified by the East India Company surgeon Helenus Scott's extensive "autobiographical" Adventures of a Rupee, 1782) which detailed the lives of oriental luxuries in their journeys from India to Britain, as well as the intricate techniques which British artists employed to capture every aspect of foreign ob- jects and the fashioning of a metropolitan aesthetic that fantasized over an imag- inary Mughal lifestyle. These narratives underscore the significance of the exotic to mainstream metropolitan English taste.20 The exotic, defined by its playful- ness, its claims to cosmopolitanism through travel and translation, did not neces- sarily involve the guilt, melancholia or xenophobia of its nineteenth-century in- carnations. Its relationship with nostalgia necessitated other identities. This is not a plea to reinsert "the Indian pale into the historiographical fray of empire," but to demonstrate the fragmented, contingent nature of British taste.21 CREATING AN ORIENTAL AURA: COLLECTING INDIAN IMAGES IN LONDON, 1770-1793 The so-called British "consumer revolution" was not only constituted by taste as class distinction or economic competition; it also emphasized the mimicry of non-European elites.22 Not just in the colonies but also in London, art collec- tors wanted to savor the trappings of Ottoman, Persian, Chinese and Mughal courts (assisted by travel accounts by Jesuit missionaries and Protestant merchants obsessed with luxuries and idolatry). This worldview couched oriental artifacts in terms of mercantilism and an attendant discourse of rarity.23 As Wolfram Schmid- gen suggests, we must supplement Marx's industrial commodity fetishism with the idea of the "mercantile fetish"-that is, the Enlightenment res articulated through its mobility-its ambivalent status between movable and immovable prop- erty and its "ancient fetishistic" agency as world-making.24 Britons believed that wealth derived from circulation. This bestowed on the object a strange, porous identity bearing little resemblance to the modern commodity closed off in self- mystification, as is the case with Marxist "commodity fetishism" (Schmidgen, 25). The energy of this mercantile fetish derived from its "gathering" ability: its capacity to transform space not only in far-flung places, as on Crusoe's savage island, but also in the public and private spaces of home. Lady Wortley Montagu, herself a traveler to the Ottoman Empire, described her London apartments as "like an Indian warehouse" and her dressing room as "like the temple of some Indian god," indicative of her desire to be captivated, even "colonized" by exotic, strangely powerful objects (Allen 1.196). 230</page><page sequence="5">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic 231 The exotic pervaded polite portraiture in a similar manner. The German- born, Italian-trained painter Johann Zoffany's Queen Charlotte and Her Two Eldest Sons (1764; figurel) displays George III's consort at a toilette where Chi- nese figurines frame her head. The silk of her gown, pearls and diamonds are probably of Indian origin. Even the costumes of her sons deflate the rivalry be- tween Alexander and Darius: the bloodstained plains of Persia are replaced with the safety of an elaborate, exotic scarlet carpet. Employing mirror reflections in a manner evoking Velasquez's Las Meninas (for instance, the "anthropomorphism" of the porcelain warriors in response to the invisible-visible servant at the door), this space and its narrative woven through objects enabled Zoffany to assert both his sitter's and his own cosmopolitanism. His image is particularly apt as it dem- onstrates the tensions between the excitement and anxiety of the exotic qua the imperial artifact. Including Zoffany, the fifteen European artists and engravers who traveled to India between 1769 and 1785 produced images that almost fe- tishized the surface detail of creolized eastern objects-whether Persian carpets, jewelry, the embroidery of a robe or the snake of a huqqa.25 In spite of its problematic role as the new ruler of Bengal, the English East India Company became a key cultural broker. Robert Clive's victory at Plas- sey in 1757, and the Company's assumption of direct rule of Bengal in 1772, mark the emergence of colonial governance characterized by political controver- sy and economic crisis. Plagued with intermittent, expensive warfare, soaring public debt, and catastrophic famines, the Company proved to be utterly inefficient in its newfound role as the sovereign.26 Only Parliamentary intervention salvaged it from bankruptcy and collapse.27 Simultaneously, a few (in)famous colonial offi- cials (exemplified by Lord Clive himself) were parading their enormous oriental fortunes in London.28 This conflict between "private vices and publick benefits" fed into popular hysteria linking empire with the threat of malicious luxury and occasioned the outrage of the Company's enemies and Parliament. The Compa- ny's London-based Court of Directors tried to govern Bengal "at a distance," due to geographical and communication constraints rather than realizing the ideals of liberal governance implying non-interference in the market, civil society and in the realm of artistic production. But the Court had no desire to elevate its colonial subjects into citizens. Neither could it treat its commercial servants as liberal actors with political rights, as under pressure from Parliament, private trade in oriental luxuries was outlawed. Such legislation involved abolishing the dastak privilege of customs exemption deployed in Company officials' private trade but sanctioning salt, opium and saltpeter as Company monopolies.29 How did these trading arrangements affect the relatively small but high- value traffic in Indian images? Although a seemingly insignificant part of the Company's economy, the dissemination of Indian art in Britain provides an ob- lique, even ironical perspective on this crisis-ridden era of monopoly and coer- cion. Outside the official realm of trade, colonial traffic in Indian art would re- peatedly undermine the Company's commercial regulations. The British drain of bullion from Bengal reversed the pre-colonial norm of importation of silver from the Americas to Bengal for financing the Company's purchase of oriental mer- chandise (Sinha, 129-56; 221-40). Reacting to this, the Directors now encour- aged and tried to promote commerce in European goods in India, including En-</page><page sequence="6">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 Figure 1.

But this strategy could not counterbalance the "drain" of Mughal images to Britain. This drain relied on an established clientele. From the late sev- enteenth century, a certain style of Mughal image economy held a discrete metro- politan market in thrall. British elites incorporated Indian pictures in their ideas of taste, as a comment in the second Earl of Shaftesbury's Characteristics makes clear: The Indian figures, the Japan work, the enamel strikes my eye. The luscious colors and glossy paint gain upon my fancy. A French or Flemish style is highly liked by me at first sight and I pursue my liking. But what ensues? Do I not for ever forfeit my good relish? How is it possible I should thus come to taste the beauties of an Italian master or of a hand happily formed on nature and the ancients?30 Shaftesbury's aesthetic admits Indian painting to the place European cognoscenti accorded to Venetian, French, and Dutch art. Even his esteem for Italian painting and sculpture is characterized not by elevated abstract, disinterested terms but by sensuality-relish, tasting, reaching for beauties, to touch the sculpted hand. The connoisseur Horace Walpole admired the materiality, style and intricacy of Mu- ghal painting, while puzzling over Indian hybridization of English prints: "I can only say with respect to [Indian-over-painted English prints] I found them in a book at Mr Verelst's among many others really Indian. He found me much struck 232</page><page sequence="7">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic 233 with the red band of the clergyman and Minerva... [the latter] is very curious and both are prettily painted.... He told me that he had in town several other English prints colored by the Indians in the same fantastic manner." At Miss Chudleigh's ball in Berkeley Square, he marveled at the ceilings "each hung with the finest Indian pictures on different colours."31 Employing metropolitan and overseas agents, William Beckford of Fonthill and the President of the Royal Acad- emy Sir Joshua Reynolds, bought Indian pictures; the latter even assigned Mu- ghal art an ambiguous space in his idea of a national aesthetic.32 This public wanted rarities. They envied others' collections: hence the snobbery and disdain for the enormous galleries of returned "nabobs." Ironically, the Company's Di- rectors expressed little desire to institutionalize colonial collecting. They contin- ued to allow Company captains and officials to trade art at their own discretion. Playing on stereotypes of Mughal courts as iconophobic, through their 'refusal' to display courtly miniatures in public, Company officials and their met- ropolitan contacts attempted to create an aura of secrecy and scarcity around these Indo-Islamic images which they defined as rarities or exotica. For Britons enthralled by the mercantile fetish, the traces of cosmopolitanism were embedded in the very fabric of Mughal miniatures. The copious gold leaf and precious pig- ments ground from jewels or rare plants in the palace gardens linked courtly paintings materially with the regalia of Mughal life. Pertaining to Indo-Islamic ideas of universal sovereignty that relied less on British cosmopolitanism's idea of a citizen of the world than on the Mughal, cosmic Padshah, these miniatures represented divine kingship in the world.33 The former Mughal Emperors Akbar and Jahangir maintained enormous karkhanas (studios) employing over a hun- dred painters. The painters' agenda was to portray their patrons as semi-divine sovereigns-hunting, at war or embracing allies, couched in complex stylistic appropriations from Isafahan, Samarkund, Constantinople, China and even Ven- ice. Princes zealously guarded these illuminated chronicles in their tosha khana (treasury) as precious, inalienable possessions, occasionally to be shown to im- portant visitors or presented as diplomatic gifts. Even during military crisis, the imperial court under Muhammad Shah (r.1719-48) acted as the Indian metropolitan center for artistic production.34 His studio included celebrity artists such as Nidha Mal (fl.1735-75) whose nuanced Delhi style portrays the emperor in private activities-such as gazing at a garden (figure 2), which, in brush and wash, intricately details fountains, gateways, plants, attendants and Muhammad Shah's processional retinue beyond the palace walls.35 But repeated, relentless invasions and the Persian sacking of Delhi led to the col- lapse of imperial patronage. Seeking refuge at regional courts in north India, Nidha Mal and colleagues were the lucky ones. Delhi chroniclers recorded that during this state of emergency painters were literally "starving to death" (McInerney 4).36 The poverty of elite families and the influence of the East India Company on indigenous practices of collecting and commissioning images, transformed the status of Indian artists and Mughal images. Now acquired through looting, as prizes, gifts, or through the expansion of bazaar networks characterized by Hin- du and Armenian dealers using their code of raqam, Indian paintings circulated in the Company's orbit. Instead of being commissioned, donated or bought as part of a complete manuscript or album, as in Mughal India, colonial officials cut</page><page sequence="8">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 Figure 2.

Indian pictures appear in as high as twenty percent of house sales in the 1770s and 1780s, indicating their rarity and high fashion sta- tus. Although historians have dubbed this the formative epoch for hardened ra- cial boundaries, contemporaries did not necessarily denigrate Mughal art as mere craft or fetish.39 The anonymous cataloguers of colonial pictures dubbed these works "Indian," suggesting a certain stylistic, cultural contingency and most prob- ably a degree of flattery for these English painters.40 But there were forms of taxonomic exclusion. Although Christie's classified Indian paintings as "fine," "beautiful," "highly finished," "elegant" or "curious," underscoring an elevated status partially shared with European art, they never mention Indian artists by name. In spite of the Mughal court practice of recording artists' names through signatures, archival inscription and imperial chronicles, this economy of Persian knowledge was entirely lost in translation.41 At auction, Mughal images waver between varying categories-sold in house sales, as curios, as fine art, or included with porcelain and oriental objects under the heading of "China," all of which accentuates the heterogeneity of contemporary taste analogous with India's am- 234</page><page sequence="9">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic 235 biguous, contested position in the "progress of civilization" and the gathering crisis of identity enveloping, even suffocating the rarity. London's elite displayed these images above their fireplaces of their most public domestic spaces-dining rooms or parlors.42 Most metropolitan homes itemize just one or two Indian pictures ornately framed, which along with their prestigious, conspicuous exposition, indicates their status as highly prized rarities desired by international ambassadors and aristocrats or "ladies and gentlemen of fashion."43 As the principal non-western art on display, their subjects varied from landscapes to royal portraits, flora and fauna, even Indian customs and seraglios ripped from Mughal albums, with a fashion for glass paintings supplementing Mughal miniatures from the mid 1770s. Their fragile medium (manufactured in north Bengal and then shipped to be painted in Calcutta), allowed them to signify as the ultra-rarity of colonialism. The now anonymous Bengali artist's Fancy pic- ture of a lady holding a rose, (c. 1780 private collection), painted on glass large enough to be a fire-mantle in a bed chamber, depicts its subject at bust-length, dressed in the finest muslin, gold, emerald, and ruby headdress, bracelets, amu- lets, and earrings, her breast garlanded with seven strings of pearls, while her pose and uncertain physiognomy (European, Turkish, Persian or Mughal) plays on a developing iconography influenced by western art then being produced by former Mughal court artists in northern and central India. These sale room luxuries of actual or ironic authenticity, oscillated be- tween exotica, fetish, and rarity. Their previous "adventures" did not feature in Christie's catalogues-the exception to this cultural "illegibility" being the Com- pany servant Mr. Simpson's 1792 auction of his Indian sculptures and paintings.44 Creating an aura of adventure and authenticity around his collection of 105 Hin- du idols and forty-two Hindu and Mughal manuscripts, Simpson's catalogue is an auto-ethnography of his encounters with Brahmin families and artists at tem- ples across south India. His negotiations with idols and artisans are intensified by accounts of their powerful or ancient provenance. For instance, he described lot 7, mutaal-amah, as an "idol [that] is said to have great influence over the small pox" (a disease wreaking havoc in both Britain and India). Frequently the god inhabiting the image and the object's personification are collapsed into one an- other in an image "who still bears the marks of his former anointing with oils, perfumes, etc." Given Protestant Britain's complex and troubled relationship with objects of worship, these images possessed an uneasy animism. While Protestant- ism defined an idol as being iconic, to symbolize something outside of its immedi- ate materiality, its difference from the arbitrary, anti-iconic nature of the fetish was frequently collapsed as early colonial investigations of Hindu worship stressed a literal adoration of objects instead of comprehending divine presence to be both transcendent and immanent.45 The renowned collectors of Greek and Indian art, Charles Townley and Richard Payne Knight bought up most of Simpson's collec- tion to enhance their ideas of oriental exotica's animism and fetishism. Instead of understanding Shiva's lingam (literally, phallus) as a symbolic but somewhat am- bivalent "column of fire," Payne Knight's treatise The Worship of Priapus fixes the Hindu object as "the primordial phallus" generic to all primitive fertility rit- uals.46 Britons believed the singularized, fetish-exotic object to be animated as unknowable, irrational forces, whose force was "close to being sui generis" (Daston,</page><page sequence="10">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 456). Britons could not escape the peculiar mimesis that structured their ideas of fetishism and religion. In consequence, a paradox determined their experiences of Indian images: either the exotic presupposed a cultural illegibility or Britons tried to compensate for this alterity by emphasizing a powerful presence for Indian images as fetishes. While denigrating other cultures for ignorance of a signifying system that necessarily involved the symbolic and the iconic, Britons were also exercising nostalgia for other worlds that had seemingly escaped the burden of representation. INJECTING NOSTALGIA INTO LUXURY EXOTICISM: MARKETING INDIAN IMAGES The specialized nature of Simpson's sale signals the contingent metropol- itan status of Indian images. Unlike Christie's, China Men competed for business through elaborate trade cards.47 These printed images stereotyped the Orient as an enchanted, exuberant, ambiguously Mughal locale of luxury and royalty, con- noted by engraved figures who invert the relationship between sitter and their material attributes in portraiture, as humans now become the accoutrements of these multi-layered things. The handbill for wholesale/retail dealer and exporter, Charles Vere at The Indian King (1772; figure 3), advertised his fine teas, choco- late, sugar, and so on, while privileging a "great variety of Indian pictures and rooms hung with the same in the genteelest taste and upon the most reasonable terms," its piece de resistance: a framed painting of an Indian prince around which oriental objects position themselves and from which they accrue their value. The Indian King also participated in the lexicon of metropolitan marketing in its allu- sion to the handbill for The Indian Queen (1751), which also sold Indian paint- ings (figure 4). Both images appropriate their iconography from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century theatrical pageants of African/North American/West Indies/ East Indies royalty. In these trade cards, racial divisions slide into each other. Skin color, stature, physiognomy, robes and the feathered headdress allude to North Americans, mulattoes, Africans, Ottomans, Britons and Mughals, integral to a marvelous, Creole realism for representing Others. Exotic cosmopolitanism pro- duces a play of different cultural elements within a single figure, as a zone where heterogeneous notions of nostalgia competed. Aggressive colonization of Bengal and the south Indian kingdom of Car- natic entangled this pre-modern iconography with British imperialism. The year 1772 may have been the high point in metropolitan taste for Indian images, but for domestic realpolitik, colonialism spelled disaster. Parliament accused Clive of corruption. The Company assumed direct rule over Bengal while grappling with extensive famines, the threat of bankruptcy and increased Parliamentary regula- tion, while Samuel Foote's sell-out farce The Nabob (1772), dragged negative stereotypes of colonial officials to new depths.48 In this time of emergency, nostal- gia acted as both a strategy of colonial reform and as a metropolitan, artistic style. Both pro- and anti-Company opinion now represented the chaos of con- temporary India as site of longing, loss and expenditure. Warren Hastings, Gov- ernor-General of Bengal (1772-85) believed that colonial rule must revive aspects of Emperor Akbar's regime (1556-1605)-which he scripted as a "glorious ep- och" before the bigotry and decadence of later Mughal "despots" took over.49 236</page><page sequence="11">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic Figure 3.

In the following decade, nostalgia became implicated in alternative ideas of crisis and emergency. Although Company opponents, exemplified by oppositional politicians such as Burke, acquiesced that this was indeed the "golden age" of Indian art and poli- tics, they believed Mughal decline to be a recent phenomenon-caused by Hast- ings's corruption, despotism, greed, and excesses.52 But China men clung to exot- ic iconography from this so-called golden, pre-colonial epoch of Mughal "high art." Their commercial choice of such an outmoded precedent paralleled the type of spatially as well as temporally distant objects they allegedly sold. Portraits from the enlightened stage of oriental despotism (associated with Akbar) project- ed metropolitan nostalgia onto the imagined past of a sovereignty now supposed- ly on the brink of collapse. The use of the Indian King or Queen as a marketing device enabled British consumers to speculate on the previous or parallel lives of these images in the collections of oriental royalty, as they appeared to be from seventeenth-century Mughal courts, even if they were contemporary copies or "fakes" commissioned in colonial bazaars. Although it was a common practice for Indian artists to seek inspiration from the massive textual and visual archives of Mughal art, including copying, adapting aspects of or even tracing images (charba), these intricate mimetic practices confounded Company merchants. They failed to detect the differences or simply did not care whether these images were old, new, fakes, copies, adaptations, whether or not they believed they had been duped by artists or dealers or not.s3 Even today, scholars and curators are still disentangling the complex stylistic provenance of images collected under the clan- destine, violent circumstances of early, predatory colonialism.54 Unlike nineteenth-century industrially produced commodities, such as Pears soap, which staked a claim in the domestication-racialization project of empire, the exoticism of eighteenth-century luxuries was not branded.55 China Men did not stamp their mark on the production of these things, largely due to Company monopolies. Instead they advertised their rare, that is to say, exclusive access to Company-monopolistic objects, which had little to do with nineteenth- century industrial objects. According to W. J. T. Mitchell, "The deepest magic of the commodity fetish is its denial that there is anything magical about it," but the practices surrounding eighteenth-century exotic objects privileged animism, ritu- al, and the uncanny, which focused on the morally equivocal artifact.56 This lux- ury consumption disciplined neither the working class nor the colonized, but pro- moted the fantasy of a heterogeneous, cosmopolitan self somehow materially linked with one of the world's leading imperial dynasties and its splendors. If civilizing processes were involved, they had little to do with the nineteenth-century liberal agenda of the White Man's Burden, as they targeted London's most polite and vicious society. Although the first colonial artists remained uninterested in repre- senting Indian labor-processes until the 1790s, by the mid 1780s metropolitan 238</page><page sequence="13">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic writers and politicians were now increasingly concerned with the lack of British accountability implicated in the colonial production of exotic luxuries: Thus, Britons are procured those eastern wares, Your ivory cabinets and your ivory chairs, Your silks, your costly gems and baneful tea ... Which for gain, thousands of Indians bleed, And base corruption's ready-growing seed Is largely sewn over Britain's famous land By an unprincipled, a savage band.57 Subaltern Indian toil is made invisible through the mystifying ideals of luxury exoticism. The enchantment of oriental objects distracts from their various life stages, as "mercantile fetish" (contaminated by Company monopolies) is now scripted as the evil force generating empire. Against the grain of the archaic mar- keting strategies of China men, the Company, Parliament, a series of societies and private enterprises wanted to disrupt the balance of eastern trade in luxuries- including pictures. If London's elite fantasized about the city becoming an impe- rial center, it could no longer be held in thrall either by the lure of Indian luxuries and or by international networks dominated by the East. British industrialization now attempted to usurp Indian luxuries with domestic manufactures-exotic only in terms of their mechanical production.58 The new urgency to accumulate, police, and transform Indian luxuries also influenced metropolitan perceptions of Indian art. Company wars in the In- dian kingdoms of Mysore and the Carnatic resulted in collecting, prize and loot of thousands of precious objects. And like Simpson's collection, British collectors justified this cultural vandalism and theft in terms of their "animistic aura"- referring to a select few objects designated "national prize" by colonial officers and donated to the British Museum (est. 1753) and the Company's Oriental Re- pository (est. 1799) in London (Davis chapter 5).59 In spite of the rhetoric of individual beneficence, these gifts to the 'nation' oscillated between personal greed and public accolade. Beneath the Company's decision to establish its museum lurked anxiety that private colonial collecting practices had careened out of con- trol, that the previous colonial policy of discreet trafficking now clashed with the 'appropriate' location of moribund Mughal high culture-the Company's head- quarters in London (Archer and Falk, 10). The Directors feared "the progressive diminution of the original stock, Hindustan may at length be much thinned of its literary [and artistic] stores, without greatly enriching Europe" as these nabob families cared little for Indian art.60 Disciplining what they perceived as a certain collecting emergency (the relentless extraction and export of Mughal cultural objects), the Directors planned an imperial archive to be invested with rarities enveloped in an aura of preservation and nostalgia. Their more pressing, unspo- ken agenda undermines their nostalgic concern: the archive must encourage fur- ther pilfering of Indian material culture not under the aegis of private vices but for public or national benefit.61 The Company's assumed agency as the "world's only historically-conscious" custodian of Mughal culture reacted to a cultural rivalry closer to home. Anticipating the ambiguous, unpredictable networks of assimilation, nostalgia, repulsion, and subversion of the Company's Museum, as 239</page><page sequence="14">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 early as 1775, colonial artists and metropolitan art institutions staked their claim in the fate of Indian imagery. BETWEEN POLITICAL CRISIS AND ARTISTIC NORM: AN IMPERIAL AESTHETIC FROM INDIAN ART The trial of Warren Hastings (1788-95) embodies the crisis of colonial rule. Caricatured by London artists as a malevolent fetish/idol (a hybrid Golden Calf/holy cow) who forces Hindus and Muslims to heed his will (British Muse- um), the former Governor-General became the "sublime" object of Burke's at- tacks on corrupt Company governance.62 Not only in the political forum but also in the artistic sphere, nabob stereotypes bled into metropolitan perceptions of the first British artists to visit India, culminating in the fantastic characterization of Hastings's favorite-Zoffany (fl. 1783-1789): The celebrated Zoffany is so well received in India that it is expected that he will acquire a fortune in a few years. For every pair of eyes capable of receiving a luster from his pencil, he receives a brace of diamonds, for every cheek that he displays a carnation blush, he is to be paid with a ruby!63 The critic's description evokes an art that almost mirrors its luxurious, oriental payment, as Zoffany's British and Indian sitters conflate material wealth with the portrayal of their own bodies. On his return to London in 1789, Zoffany fash- ioned himself as an Orientalist artist, cramming his studio with Indian images and curios including huqqas, peacock fans, armor and an ivory Shiva-all of which he hoped would contribute to his cosmopolitan-imperial self presentation.64 His paintings engage with his and his friends' collections of Mughal art, exempli- fied by Colonel Polier entertaining Zoffany, Colonel Martin and John Wombwell, c.1786 (figure 5). Three of the most (in)famous colonial collectors-Antoine de Polier, John Wombwell and Claude Martin, made their fortunes (and their collec- tions) through their equivocal dealings with princes and the Company in north India. In Zoffany's composition, Polier and Martin, not the English Wombwell, wear Company uniforms, while the former displays a mustache and fur hat allud- ing to his desire to live like a prince.65 These men from the margins, ambiguously loyal to Switzerland, France, and Britain, working for both nawabs and the East India Company, became key cultural players in India and the West. On his return to Europe, Polier became one of the principle repositories of highly prized Mu- ghal miniatures. His enormous collection in Lausanne acted ambivalently as both a personal collection and as a possible market source for Indian art. By this I mean he sent or sold images to Beckford, Hastings, William Jones, the colonial widow Lady Coote, and Cambridge University, as a bid to be esteemed not only by Europe's leading Orientalist collector but as one of the world's major arbitra- tors of taste.66 In Zoffany's composition, all four men, preoccupied with household econ- omy and aesthetics, lounge in Polier's Lucknow home, decorated not with Mu- ghal miniatures but with Zoffany's ethnographic pictures. Zoffany pauses from his enormous canvas of Hindu Holy Men and Woman under a Banyan Tree, to meet the viewer's gaze, while one of Polier's many albums of Mughal miniatures 240</page><page sequence="15">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic Figure 5. Johann Zoffany, Colonel Polier and his friends Johann Zoffany, Claude Martin and John Wombwell, c. 1786, oil on canvas, by permission, Victoria Memorial Hall, Calcutta, India. (recognizable from its bindings and now in Berlin), lies by his side. Several early sixteenth-century Jahengiri images from Polier's collection include subjects that Zoffany would subtly allude to in his work for these men.67 This circle of Compa- ny administrators also commissioned Mughal painters to interpret Zoffany's com- positions in both gouache miniatures and oils so as to produce a dynamic cross- fertilization, a creolization of Indian and British art.68 These negotiations of an "Anglo-Indian" aesthetic had already been developed by the first professional British portraitist to visit courtly India-Tilly Kettle (fl. 1768-76). Also working at an Islamic court and mixing with the Polier circle, Kettle's portraits of the ruler Shuja ud-daula bear a striking resemblance to the work of Mughal artists who had migrated from Delhi-most crucially Mihr Chand (figures 6, 7). How did this exclusive "Anglo-Indian" style penetrate the increasingly imperialist art world in London? Did it project itself in terms of exclusion, limited access, and association with a royal court or in terms of a far more blatant and aggressive colonialism? Living in India, Zoffany and Kettle targeted London ex- hibitions at the Society of Artists and Royal Academy. They intended to disrupt the increasingly institutionalized, metropolitan monopoly over what should be a "British" aesthetic. Both were already members of leading art academies in Lon- don; both wanted to stake their claim in the competing aesthetics of contempo- rary Britain by drawing attention to the contingency of Britishness. Zoffany was German; both men had Indian wives/families outside of Britain and both were extremely ambitious. So their status on the margins of empire, forces us to re- 241</page><page sequence="16">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 Figure 6.

Experimenting with a variety of styles and subjects, Kettle pushed London publics and critics to the threshold of perception; he forced them to admit the indeterminacy of British taste. The reception and the production of this heterogeneous colonial art expose a certain crisis about how to think, see, and write about imagery qua imperialism. Metropolitan conflicts over subject, composition, style, and "appropriate mime- sis" determine how metropolitan commentators constructed these debates, voiced most critically by the reviewer of Kettle's Nawab of Faizabad-Shuja ud-daula with General Barker, (Society of Artists, 1775): No painter living has a better field for object than Mr. Kettle and would he favor us with small whole lengths as conversation pieces and show us the customs and manners of the people of the East and suppose effects like Rembrandt, we might hope to see him produce many interesting and valuable pictures.69 A high profile model for British art, Rembrandt provided the most famous canon for a Protestant country's assimilation of Indian images. Employed by a director of the Dutch East India Company in 1642 to take his likeness, in the next fifteen years Rembrandt acquired an album of Jehangiri miniatures, aspects of which he "mimicked" to produce a hybrid "resemblance."70 His ideas of style based on cultural experimentations, exemplified the agency of exotic art in the production of a modern commercial aesthetic.71 In contrast with this golden age of seventeenth-century Dutch art and commerce, late eighteenth-century British appropriations of Indian art became entangled with that complex customary aesthetic agenda being institutionalized by the Society's greatest rival-the Royal Academy. At one level the Academy's President Joshua Reynolds emulated Rembrandt. Like Rembrandt, Reynolds had been commissioned by the English East India Company's Court of Directors to portray one of its heroes-Stringer Lawrence; in addition to owning Indian art he acquired one of Rembrandt's drawings after a Mughal miniature.72 He also culti- vated a private clientele of leading "nabobs" and touched up colonial pictures sent as gifts from Hastings to George III. In the wake of his ambition, from the 1790s, the Academy advised Parliament on the construction of colonial monu- ments to be shipped from the "metropolis" to India and on the rate of customs duties to be paid on colonial and other "foreign" art in London.73 Reacting to colonial crisis in India and America in 1776, the high profile political circle around Reynolds vilified imperial corruption. Influenced by his friend Adam Smith's condemnation of Company commercial monopolies in The Wealth of Nations and Burke's turn against Hastings, Reynolds nevertheless be- gan to devise an imperial aesthetic. At first glance, his choice of "comparative manners" as suitable artistic subjects, couched in Burke's and Smith's own ideas of morality, sovereignty, and beauty and his own private taste, seem remarkably sympathetic. British artists should appreciate local customs as a type of "second nature" from which to abstract the universal, humanistic "first nature" of excel- lence and transcendental virtue.74 Like Smith and Burke, Reynolds would refer to India-but in his case, in the most ambiguous terms: "What is approved of in the</page><page sequence="18">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 Eastern nations as grand and majestic would be considered by the Greeks and Romans as turgid and inflated and they in return would be thought by the Orien- tals to express themselves in a cold and insipid manner."75 Against the grain of his multiple, perhaps even conflictual, relations with representatives of the Company (always a source of his male portrait clientele), the undertow of Reynolds's annu- al lectures to the Academy would from now on prescribe the manner in which British artists must demote the rarity status of Indian art. For all its disinterested, cultural relativism, this ultimately Eurocentric aesthetic endorsed empire. I want to clinch this issue by juxtaposing Reynolds's "customary" aesthetic with a cita- tion from one of his principle influences -Shaftesbury's "Advice to an Author": Like that sovereign artist or universal plastic Nature, he forms a whole, coherent and proportioned in itself, with due subjection and subordina- cy of constituent parts . . . how far their genius may be depressed or raised by any external causes, arising from the humor or judgment of the world. (111-2, my emphasis) Unlike Shaftesbury's Author engaged with "external causes" in the world, Rey- nolds's Artist appropriates from different cultures so as to fashion his universal- imperial aesthetic. The "external" now included the appropriation of the exotic, as he professed an aesthetic for a nationalistic, modern commercial and imperial society. In so doing his aims parallel the Society of Artists' promotion of domestic manufactures over eastern luxuries and Company monopolies, by which I mean Reynolds wanted to dismantle the importance of the pre-colonial exotic. Like the Company's museum a decade later, the Academy tried to institutionalize colonial and metropolitan responses toward Indian art. Instead of "undigested" apprecia- tion of the aura of oriental rarities, "the man of taste" must select from and discipline the proliferation of cultural aesthetics/artifacts: Like a sovereign judge and arbiter of art, he is possessed of that presiding power which separates and attracts every excellence from every school; selects both what is great and what is little; brings home knowledge from the East and from the West; making the universe tributary towards furnishing his mind and enriching his works with originality and variety of innovations. (Reynolds, Discourse VI, 110) Paradoxically, even ironically, given Reynolds's engagement with Shaftesbury and his personal taste in Mughal miniatures, it is his rigorous policing of the visual cultures of "despotic" (Mughal) and "mercenary" (Company) "illiberal" aesthet- ics which must pre-condition and be subordinated to a liberal British art. In his later Discourses, Reynolds characterized Indian architecture through "barbaric splendor" as a mere starting point for artistic composition, while transforming the Academy Schools and annual exhibitions into the training ground for imperi- al artists and site for colonial experimentation (Discourse XIII).76 Although the exact artistic processes for how Royal Academy artists should abstract from dif- ferent cultural styles are never discussed, Reynolds's Discourses underscore the contingent, ambiguous space for a British aesthetic forced to accommodate Other art objects in the uncertain but necessary transformation of the exotic into an imperial aesthetic. 244</page><page sequence="19">EATON / Nostalgia for the Exotic 245 The Academy's cultural policy made little space for colonial artists. Al- though shifting his loyalty from the rival Society of Artists to the Royal Academy by exhibiting there from 1777, Kettle would never be elected Associate. In spite of a series of high-profile reviews and a well-calculated marriage, deep in debt by 1783, he fled across the Ottoman Empire, trying to return to his Indian family and colonial friends. He died mysteriously in the desert somewhere near Basra. Zoffany also found the metropolitan art scene increasingly hostile to his style and subjects: he sought permission from the Company to return to India, but before concrete plans could be made, he died. Even those British artists trained at the Royal Academy Schools who traveled to India could not rely on the Academy's support. Several ran into severe financial difficulties, one being declared bank- rupt and thrown into a debtors' prison in London and another committing sui- cide due to lack of British patronage in Calcutta, to the point that by 1800, Brit- ish artists either did not want to go to India or to perhaps more crucially, return to Britain.77 CONCLUSION: A LITTLE NOSTALGIA GOES A LONG WAY In this era of imperial emergence and emergency, both nostalgia and the exotic were dramatically transferred from the rarity of mercantilism to the arti- fact of imperialism. While nostalgia retained a sense of homesickness for colonial communities overseas, as a manifestation of "historical decline" it was also being displaced onto Britain's cultural Others. Although in the early eighteenth century, metropolitan elites and middle classes wanted to emulate the cultural trappings of the Mughal court (through luxury exoticism), in the ensuing decades Indian art would be typecast as decadent in lieu with developing ideas of Mughal and colo- nial society. Opposing British political factions explained this Orientalist con- struction of India in different ways. Pro-Hastings supporters believed that Mu- ghal society had generated its own downfall; his opponents argued he had initiated this decline and both agreed Mughal culture to be caught in a double bind-to be salvaged by being anglicized-whether through its material or ideological appro- priation. Christie's records chart the disappearance of Mughal art from elite Lon- don homes from 1785 whereby they survive only in specialist museums-which provided a precedent for the Company's Repository.78 Even though certain Mu- ghal miniatures (especially from the reign of Akbar) continued to be admired as rarities, they no longer inhabited the increasingly exclusive taxonomy of high art. Rarity became articulated by scarcity, as something more curious than wondrous, more urgently valuable when threatened with oblivion. Colonial writers and paint- ers now criticized Indian art for its lack of perspective, its "wooden" figures and poverty of genius.79 By the 1800s, neither metropolitan nor colonial painters wanted to assimilate Mughal art into the contemporary visual economy. British stakes in other histories through Mughal court images, acquired by theft, gift or as copies and fakes, constructed an increasingly chauvinistic, imperial taste based on a racial hierarchy privileging a metropolitan-centric vision charged with erad- icating its own difficult relationships with the Company. The intercourse of these aesthetic norms was born out of contingency and a series of economic and artistic</page><page sequence="20">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 39 / 2 emergencies. In order to legitimize, even disguise these tensions, crisis had to be projected onto an increasingly homogenized, increasingly fractious Oriental Other. Nostalgia, "repetition that mourns the inauthenticity of all repetition," is ultimately concerned with the production of a present, not the reproduction of a past (Stewart, 23). Its cultural practices locate a "once was" in relation to "the now"-in this instance, dramatizing the contingency of the exotic in the metrop- olis. Although pictures are typically dubbed a crucial nostalgic medium, here they assume a profound ambivalence. The scarcer and more rarified Mughal imagery became, the more Britons fetishized its presence and its absence-uncannily real- ized in the contested collecting and commissioning habits this essay has outlined. Banished to the threshold of British aesthetics, Mughal art assumed the "form of the exception, that is, as something that is included solely through an exclusion."80 British taste nourished itself on this exception. Its nostalgia, characterized by bit- tersweet melancholia for what metropolitan practices were destroying, needed Indian imagery both to disappear and to survive. To this end Mughal art became the impossible vehicle for colonial longing.

Polier was one of the most prolific collectors of his age. Even in India, he sold 215 manu- scripts to Edward Pote, Orientalist of King's College, Cambridge who donated some of these to Eton (Hauptman 34). 67. The image included here is from an album originally produced for the Mughal Emperor Jah- angir, c.1610 including works by masters such as Govardhan, in the Staatsbibliothek Preussischor Kulturbesitz, Berlin. 68. Mir Chand adapted at least 68 copies of European paintings (including a Titian Venus) for Polier-as seen in his correspondence in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris (Supp. Persian 479, ff.256- 257). Bengal Inventories: L/AG/34/27/24 (OIOC) 1800 (estate of Colonel Claude Martin) included eight Indian copies after Zoffany pictures. His agenda is mixed: for example he did not own Zoffa- ny's Mr and Mrs Hastings so may have wanted a "substitute" but he did own several of the other pictures of which he wanted copies. 69. Morning Post, May 1, 1775, 1 (my emphasis). 70. His possessions in 1656 included "an album of curious miniature drawings"; twenty-one of his own drawings after Indian miniatures are so far known. 71.

From 1775, Reynolds's Discourses incorporate references to the East and from 1783, those artists who traveled to India were almost exclusively educated at the Academy's Schools. Painters (for instance John Flaxman) who never traveled to India began to experiment with Indian subjects from Mughal miniatures. 77. A.W. Devis went bankrupt on his return to London; John Alefounder, although a former prize winner at the RA, could not find a colonial clientele in Calcutta and hanged himself. 78. According to CSC, from the late 1770s, Indian pictures begin to disappear from the prime spaces of elite homes by 1785. In the mid 1780s Indian images are itemized as being on staircases or in butlers' garrets or else as part of specialized "oriental museums" such as that of the Honorable Richard Bateman (CSC May 3, 1774) and Captain Carr (CSC February 9, 1780). 79.
