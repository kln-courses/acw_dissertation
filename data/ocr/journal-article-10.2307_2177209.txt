(I) The main problem of this investigation is to determine the nature of the process whereby we ascribe reality to a mental content. This I ac- tualization process' is of two kinds: the objective, which directly refers the content to an external reality, and the subjective, which claims reality for the content merely as our own mental experience. They are distinct but coordinate psychical processes which have the same content. The dis- tinction between subjective representation and objective reference is not given in the content as such, but is rather the result of a psychological de- velopment. Language tends to conceal the fact that the objective and subjective I ascriptions of reality to a content' are really two different pro- cesses which refer to the same content. Names indicate not merely the content of an idea, but the object to which it refers. Reality is not orig- inally a concept, but a thought, and, like all thoughts, can be reduced to ideational processes. This reduction can be accomplished either analyt- ically or synthetically. The latter method, which is not very fruitful or reliable, seeks to reconstruct the historical development of thought either directly, by reflection upon our own psychical past, or indirectly, through the development of language. The analytic method, which seeks for the component ideas of thought through introspective analysis, is a more reli- able method. Yet it is beset with serious difficulties, for different individ- uals have different ideas out of which the one thought is constructed, and even the same individual may have different ideas at different times. These difficulties can only be overcome by a large number of independ- ent observations. (II) There are two types of answers which have been 455</page><page sequence="2">456 THE PZILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. given to this question concerning the nature of the process of ascribing reality to a content. The first, which may be called an absolute solution, regards the judgment of reality as a special quality which belongs to the content for which reality is claimed. The relative explanation regards the ' actualization process' as a special relation which the content in question bears to other contents. One absolute explanation claims that our 'judg- ments of reality' depend upon certain feelings of compulsion. This view is invalidated, however, by the fact that, as in the case of imaginative natures, subjective processes may equally be felt as compelling. To the modified form of this theory, which would make the criterion the remem- brance of past feelings of compulsion, it may be replied that it is a mere schema, not true to the facts of experience. Moreover, it necessitates our regarding reality as a continuum of infinitely graded intensities. The process whereby we ascribe reality to a content may have degrees, but reality itself presents no such gradations. It either is or is not. A second absolute theory is called by Hillebrand the ' Ideo-genetic theory.' Ac- cording to this view, there is a special psychical faculty, a fundamental un- analyzable act of consciousness, by means of which we ascribe or deny reality to a mental content. But this view is not true to experience, for it does not take account of the great variety of ways in which we ascribe reality to a content; e. g., we may ascribe to a content the reality of the past, present, or future, - or of a here or a there. If the theory were to take full account of this variety, it would be driven to the absurdity of as- suming as many original faculties as there are varieties in the ' actualization process.' A third absolute solution asserts that perception plays the essential part in the 'judgment of reality.' The origin of the thought of reality lies in perception. The perceived is the actual. In the original sensation, contents have a compelling power, an intense feeling aspect, and a permanence which they lack in reproduction. The ' actualization process' consists in the consciousness of that general quality by which a sensation is sharply distinguished from the mere representation, and which may be termed its ' reality coloring' ( Wirkichkeitsfarbe). This ' reality coloring' is not something new added to the perception, but is an integral part of the perception itself, which can only be distinguished as a special moment of the whole perceptive process by subsequent reflection. That none of the absolute theories save one gives satisfaction, and that only in the expla- nation of perceptual contents, is indirect proof of the relative theories. If there is no psychical process which assigns reality to a content in its fullest isolation, then the process of thinking reality must consist in a relation of the content in question to other contents. In order to be held as real, a content must be brought into relation with such contents as are already held to be real. Reality can only be discovered through its relation to an already recognized reality. The ' process of ascribing reality' to a content is the ordering of a content in the total connected whole of Reality. A. U. POPE.</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 457 The Tine Qiiality. HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL. Mind, No. 6I, pp. 1-26. The purpose of this article is to show that the time quality, like the algedonic quality (cf. the author's Pain, Pleasure, and AEsthetics), is a general, three-phased quality which exists in one phase or another in con- nection with each presentation. The point of departure is a consideration of the presentative complexity in itself, since this complexity is of special significance in the study of the time quality and its phases. The com- plexity of presentations of reflection corresponds to neururgic complexity, which is due primarily to the action of a variety of stimuli in successive moments upon the neururgic system. Man lives in a constantly chang- ing environment; the position of sources of stimulation in relation to his body is continuously altered. Some sources of stimulation are always coming nearer to him, while others are as constantly receding from him. Consequently the neururgic patterns in man display various modes of com- plexity. They involve either a developing complexity (due to man's approach to stimuli or their approach to him), or a stationary complexity (due to a relatively fixed relation between the organism and its stimuli), or a simplifying complexity (due to separation between organism and its sources of stimulation). On the hypothesis of a thorough-going noetic and neururgic correspondence, one would expect to find in consciousness some general quality corresponding to this three-phased characteristic of neururgic disturbance which we picture to ourselves in terms of our spatial concep- tions. Such a general three-phased quality of presentations is furnished in the time quality, which appears in the form of pastness, presentness, or futureness, and which is generally described in spatial terms. Pastness is usually thought of as involving something going from us, presentness as involving something with us, and futureness as involving something ap- proaching us. This relation of the several phases of the time quality to presentative complexity the author emphasizes further by symbolizing in formulae the nature of presentation in general, and also of those presenta- tions in which the time relations become explicit. From this attempt he emerges with the conclusion that pastness is in indissoluble relation with the simplification of presentative complexity; that futureness is given in relation to the development of this complexity; and that presentness is attached to the relatively unchanging complexity. All of these phases of the time quality are to some extent present in every complex presentation, but one or the other receives the emphasis. The presentness is the norm, as it were, but, like the algedonic norm (i. e., indifference), displays more or less of indefiniteness; on the one hand, it reaches into the futureness, and, on the other, into the pastness. Whether the suggested relation between the time phases and the presentational complexity be accepted or rejected, the author thinks that his discussion has shown that time-ness is a general quality of all presentations; that it is of a three-phased nature; that at least one of the phases must usually be predominant; that, finally, if any</page><page sequence="4">458 THE PHILOSOPRICA(L REVIEW [VOL. XVI. one phase is predominant as a qualification of a state of consciousness, this fact necessarily excludes the prominence of the other two from the same state. G. W. CUNNINGHAM. L'idee de ne'ant. H. BERGSON. Rev. Ph., XXXI, II, PP. 449-466. If it can be proved that the idea of nothingness is a pseudo-idea, the problems arising about it will be shown to be pseudo-problems. We have only to consider the idea of nothingness as the abolition of all things, in order to see the absurdity which it conceals. A vacuum is always in idea a plenum which is resolved by analysis into two positive elements: one, the idea, distinct or confused, of a substitution; the other, the feeling, exper- ienced or imagined, of a desire or of a regret. It follows from this analy- sis that the idea of absolute nothingness, taken in the sense of the abolition of all things, is self-destructive, a pseudo-idea, a mere word. Paradoxical as it may appear, there is more contained in the idea of an object con- ceived as not existing than in the idea of the same object conceived as existing, for the idea of the former is necessarily the idea of the latter 5hlzs the representation of an exclusion of this object from reality. Negation may be said to be the removal of an affirmation or the half of an intellec- tual act of which the other half is left undetermined. The correlation of affirmation and negation, from the point of view of formal logic, is external and superficial. To deny consists always in presenting, in shortened form, a system of two affirmatives, one determined and bearing upon a certain possibility, the other undetermined and referring to a reality either unknown or indifferent which supplants this possibility. Negation, which exists to correct and prevent error in another, has a pedagogical or social character. Since it is raised about a pseudo-idea, the question how any- thing can exist is a pseudo-problem. The removal of illusory difficulties should precede the consideration of real problems. FRANK B. CRANDALL. Logique rationnelle e/tjsychoiogisme. G. H. LuQUTET. Rev. Ph., XXXI, I2, pp. 6oo-6io. This article is written in reply to one in Rev. de MeM., May, i906, by L. Couturat. The opponent of Couturat seems to be Ribot, the former recognizing one logic, the latter, two, which he opposes one to the other. Ribot makes the distinction that psychology reports phenomena and logic formulates rules; the one asks how we think ordinarily, and the other, how we think correctly. In order to understand them, the psychologist must maintain an impartial position between affective logic and rational logic. Couturat did not maintain this impartial attitude. Furthermore, he has confounded logic and logical relations, and psychology and psychologism. Psychologism has no concern for either logic or psychology; it belongs solely to the province of epistemology. In his criticism of psychologist, Couturat is fighting an imaginary foe. FRANK B.

It is charged, first, that realism is identical with psychophysical dualism or epiphenomenalism, the doctrine that consciousness is incapable of pro- ducing effects in the world of objects; secondly, that it is identical with metaphysical dualism, or the belief that real objects are things-in-them- selves entirely transcending our knowledge and possessing none of the qualities which we attribute to them. The third misconception is the identification of realism with epistemological dualism, or the representative theory of knowledge, according to which we can have direct knowledge only of our ideas, which, as phenomena, are numerically distinct from the real objects which can merely be inferred to exist behind them. Although these three types of dualism have been held by individual realists, none of them is implied by realism as such; for its primary meaning is that things do not depend for their existence upon the fact that we know them, and that consequently they can continue in what is called existence during those intervals of time in which no subject is aware of them. In answer to these misconceptions, it may be argued: (I) That, while realism does deny the identity of being and perception, it does not deny the power of consciousness to affect indirectly the objects known; (2) that, while realism holds that objects exist independently of a knowing consciousness, it does not hold that these objects change their nature when they pass out of con- sciousness. To deny that the world is reducible to sensible objects in the relation of consciousness, does not imply that the world is not reducible to sensible objects. (3) While almost all realists in modern philosophy have held the theory of epistemological dualism, it is not essential to their belief as realists. Presentative or monistic realism is not self-contradictory, though it is more difficult to defend than the dualistic form of realism. The idealist should not then regard a refutation of dualism as equivalent to a refutation of realism. MATTIE ALEXANDER MARTIN. Some Inadequacies of Modern Theories of Judgment. W. H. SHELDON. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., IV, 4, pp. 94-I00. Some of our modern theories of judgment, well-established though they are, yet restate rather than solve the main problem. By judgment is here meant, not merely a logical process, nor merely a psychical event, nor a proposition of language, but something with all these aspects. Judgment is understood to be a psychical state or process, with a peculiar logical signification, capable of a certain symbolic statement, and at least partially expressible in the idioms of language. What may be called the orthodox view of judgment is that we entertain some psychical material, and use it, whether as it is or as transformed into a concept, to point to the real. It is this view which seems inadequate; for the nature of judgment is not com-</page><page sequence="6">460 THE PHIL OSOPHICA4L RE VIE W. [VOL. XVI. pletely understood until we know, not only what function it performs, and what structure it has, but how the structure reveals its function. The problem may be insoluble. No constant structure may be found in the psychical content of judgment; or, if found, it may have nothing to do with any common-sense idea of reality. But this still remains the main problem. The judgment as it exists and is used in human experience has two mutually conditioning sides, function and structure, and the problem is not adequately conceived till we study both sides as conditioning each other. MATTIE ALEXANDER MARTIN. ETHICS. Definition and Analysis of the Consciousnzess of Value. WILBUR M. URBAN. Psych. Rev., XIV, I, PP. I-36; 2, Pp. 92-I2I. I. For the unreflective worth-consciousness, descriptions of value are tertiary qualities belonging to the object as much as the so-called primary and secondary qualities. Inspection shows these tertiary qualities to be acquired meanings of the object for a subject, predetermined by ante- cedent psychical processes. Worth-predicates may be defined as the selec- tive, funded, affective-volitional meanings of objects, -selective in repre- senting differentiation of aspects of objects acquired in processes of feeling and will, and funded in representing the accumulation of meaning of these processes. Analysis of worth-predicates reveals equivocal meanings which arise, like cognitive contradictions, through abstraction of the predicates from the processes in which meaning was acquired. Worth-sciences express this equivocation by distinctions such as subjective or objective, real or ideal, actual or imputed, intrinsic or instrumental. In all these cases, value judgments express functions of the relation of subject to object, but in various modifications of attitudes of the subject as determined by different dispositions and interests. Two important consequences follow: (i) The analysis underlying these distinctions furnishes a clue to the psy- chological investigation of the different attitudes; and (2) since worth is the affective-volitional meaning of the object for the subject in different attitudes, the way is open for classification of the fundamental worth- attitudes. Three fundamental attitudes may be distinguished: (i) Simple appreciation of the meaning of an object for the self; (2) the personal attitude, in which worth is determined by explicit reference of the object to the characterized self or alter ; (3) the impersonal attitude, in which the subject is identified with an impersonal over-individual subject and the value is determined by explicit reference to the over-individual demand. The objects of valuation may be simple or founded objects, and may be classified correspondently with the subject-attitudes: (i) Objects of simple appreciation (either physical or psychical); (2) objects of personal worth founded in characterization of the person (the self or the alter); (3) objects</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.1 SUZMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 46i of common worth founded in processes of social participation. The defini- tion of value as affective-volitional meaning must be interpreted to include the pre-j udgmental attitude of immediate appreciation as well as the reflective judgments of ethics and economics which include the worth feeling as a partial determinant. The double term I affective-volitional' suggests two questions: Is feeling or desire the fundamental characteristic of worth ? Is worth co-extensive with feeling or desire? Ehrenfels makes desire fundamental and feeling a matter of dispositional presupposition. Meinong reverses the distinction. Ehrenfels admits the determination of desire by increase in pleasure, a view the difficulties of which led Meinong to make feeling fundamental. The latter view is preferable for the following reasons: The sense of worth implies a felt meaning, but not necessarily a desire or volition; where desire is part of the experience, its essence is describable in terms of feeling of lack. The moment of desire may be present in the form of ' desirability' merely. In reply to the second ques- tion, Meinong restricts value to I judgment-feelings,' maintaining that the antecedent psychical condition in worth-consciousness is always a judg- ment. This is true in so far as it denies the aspect of worth| to the mere presentation feeling; the feeling attitude which is fundamental to worth- consciousness has additional presuppositions. Are these distinguishing presuppositions exclusively judgmental, as Meinong maintains ? This implies the presupposition of the existence of the object as essential to the worth-consciousness. But immediate consciousness of value may exist without explicit existential judgment. Presupposition of reality is always present, but not necessarily in the form of existential judgment. The primitive pre-judgmental presumption of reality, the assumption which recognizes the possibility of non-existence, the existential judgment, and, finally, the permanent assumptions owing their funded meaning to habitual judgments, may all function as the reality meanings which distinguish the feeling of value from mere feeling tone. What is the relation between the acts of cognition, which are the psychical presuppositions of valuation, and the conative tendencies forming its dispositional conditions ? The answer must be in genetic terms. At the cognitive stage of primitive presump- tion, cognitive and conative moments are scarcely distinguishable. When the conative factor first suffers arrest by development of independent cognitive interest, subjective and objective controls are differentiated and the attitude of assumption emerges. With the existential judgment is involved the acknowledgment or disavowal of a control factor. Feeling of value, therefore, is the feeling aspect of a conative process. By conative process is meant the total process, including actual and dispositional moments, by which affective-volitional meaning is acquired. We must next inquire -how these dispositions vary, qualitatively and quantitatively, at different stages of development with changes of presupposition and with inclusions of secondary judgments of relation, etc. II. Feeling itself may become the object of both presentation and judge</page><page sequence="8">462 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. ment. The resulting description is 'appreciative' and fixes the place of a feeling attitude in a system of possible attitudes which are referred to the self as a center. The ultimate terms of appreciative description should furnish the fundamental modifications of worth-feeling. The conception that the innumerable nuances of feeling are reducible to difference in intensity and duration of the pleasantness-unpleasantness continuum has been criticised recently from the point of view of the psychology of value and of psycho-physical analysis. The feeling attitude may be qualitatively described in other terms than pleasantness-unpleasantness. Similarly, intensity is not sufficient to express quantitative differences in worth-feeling. The irreducible aspects of feeling must be expressed in terms of quality and degree. Qualitatively, every feeling attitude has two primary aspects, its direction and its reference. Its direction is positive or negative; its reference, transgredient or immanental. The former refers to the pleasantness-unpleasantness duality of quality; the latter has more specific reference to conation. Transgredient reference means subjective control leading on to other states; immanental, a sense of more objective control leading to repose in the same state. Transgredient reference is expressed in terms of tension, restlessness, contraction ; immanental, in terms of repose, relaxation, expansion. The correlation of these terms of appreciative de- scription with the three-dimensional theory of Wundt is obvious. Whether the terms equally characterize sensation feelings is not yet conclusively shown. In any case, valuation takes place only at the level of emotion, i. e., of a feeling attitude which presupposes a cognitive act. Implied reference to reality exists even in objectless emotions, e. g., as expressed in the impersonal judgment. The specific types of reference of feeling may be correlated with types of cognitive presupposition. Transgredient reference involves transition, on the cognitive side, of presumption into assumption and judgment-; the immanental reference is the feeling attach- ing to judgment habit. Derived feeling attitudes, from the genetic view- point, involve progression in meaning or a value movement. Acquired feelings fall into two groups: (i) Acquired meanings of simple apprecia- tion; and (2) of characterization and participation. The feeling of obliga- tion, appreciatively described, is an acquired modification of the feeling of transgredient reference, of tension. Its differentiation lies in its cognitive presuppositions. It is a transitive mode in which an existential feeling is qualified by an assumption feeling. The aesthetic psychosis belongs to the class of simple appreciation and is described in terms of immanental reference. The typical cognitive presuppositions involve the minimizing of explicit judgment and the presence of either assumption stage. Sec- ondary acquired meanings arise in judgments of personal worth, utilization and participation values. These feelings arise through the establishment of relational judgments between the object and the disposition presupposed. The quantitative aspect of worth meanings requires distinction from that of sensation-feelings. Positive worth feeling may co-exist with actual</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] SUAMIMARIES OF ARTICLES. 463 unpleasantness and vice versa; degree of worth feeling may increase with decrease of hedonic intensity; value feeling may be without intensity. According to the dualistic theory of Brentano and Schwartz, the worth feeling is a modification of the will, accompanied by an irrelevant hedonic aspect, as feeling modification, termed hedonic 'redundancy.' Such an assumption of the separateness of will and feeling is not necessary, at least. From a genetic standpoint, the transgredient and immanental references of feeling may, when repeatedly actualized by cognitive acts, become differentiated, as selective meanings, from the aspect of hedonic intensity. This relation is analogous to that between the general concept and particular presentation. M. W. SPRAGUE. La morale conditionnelle. ADRIEN NAVILLE. Rev. Ph., XXXI, I2, Pp. 56I-575. This article was called forth by the book, La morale et la science des mars, by Levy-Brilhl. The doctrine of conditional ethics cannot be established without the distinction being drawn between moral teleology, the system of obligatory ends, and ethics proper, the means for realizing the ideal con- ceived by the former. Ethics is the theory of the best means furnished by reality for the most complete realization possible of the ideal. It is ethics thus understood, and not moralteleology, that is conditional. Moral teleology is the theory of good ends and of their comparative values. There are but four possible ends in virtue of our human nature, namely, truth or knowledge for oneself, truth or knowledge for others, happiness for oneself, and happiness for others. Ethics involves a doctrine of the comparative value of these two ends, truth and happiness. The received codes of ethics differ regarding the duty of veracity. Teleology must give the deci- sion in regard to the different values we place upon persons in respect to their right to pleasure and knowledge. Several theories seem possible: identity of rights, equality of rights, acquired inequalities, natural inequali- ties. Ethics proper rests upon teleology, on the one hand, and upon a knowledge of reality, on the other. All moral precepts employ an 'if,' when understood as general and not universal. Duty varies according to circumstances. The distinction between moral teleology and ethics proper dismisses the contention that the difference in moral ideas and practice in different times and in different places disproves the existence of human con- science and practical reason. Moral precepts must and will change with changing circumstances. Sociology will guard men from deception in this adaptation and will give stability to ' rational social art,' provided moral teleology is made the foundation. FRANK B. CRANDALL. Si5inoza et ses contemporains (Suite et fin). L. BRUNSCHWICG. Rev. de Met., XIV, 5, pp. 691-732. The thinkers of the seventeenth century did not separate science and religion, but rather attempted to justify the latter by the former. Space</page><page sequence="10">464 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEWV. and time were treated in a new fashion, and both were considered infinite. Matter for Descartes was substance possessing all the properties of ex- tension. Thus the laws of geometry gave rise to the universal laws of dynamics, and nature became real and infinite. But this scientific extra- polation necessitated a metaphysical extrapolation. God, too, was con- sidered infinite, transcending all limitation, and, as such, incomprehensible to man. This conception is seen in the philosophy of Malebranche, but in Leibniz the harmony of science and religion is effected by means of the principle of reason, which resolves particular truth into the infinity of its determining conditions; each monad implies the universe. It was the work of Kant, however, to show that the very reason which justified the existence of rational science overthrew rational metaphysics. The objects of metaphysics can never be given in space and time; there can be no intellectual intuition. Pascal taught a transcendent Christianity; God is a refuge against the errors of reason, a consolation and hope. Thus the religious consciousness for Pascal is not subject to psychological investi- gation. Divine truths are put into the soul by God alone, who is personal, moving in space and time. Although originally there is an antagonism between God and man, yet through Him a relationship is established. The Bible is divine truth revealed to man. Spinoza, on the other hand, believed that science was to free us from an irrational belief in a tran- scendent and anthropomorphic God. His problem was: How is science, which substitutes the study of essences for the search for final causes, capable of ruling the moral life, and of showing the way to happiness ? But, instead of passing from the mathematical to the moral, Spinoza denied the moral, and hence his system becomes merely a spatial realism. From this point of view, substance is only a substrate which supports sense qualities. But Spinoza rejects universals and regards the world as consist- ing of a number of irreducible and individual essences. These particular and affirmative essences are, however, only known through intuition, in which all idea of the particular experience is eliminated. Morover, to have this third kind of knowledge, we must pass from sensible to intelli- gible space. Thus Spinoza substitutes for the opposition between the universal and the individual that between the individual, which is an abstraction, and the universe, which is a totality. God becomes unifying thought, the reality of the universe, both the nalura nalurans, and the nat/ira naliirala. R. B. WAUGH.</page></plain_text>
