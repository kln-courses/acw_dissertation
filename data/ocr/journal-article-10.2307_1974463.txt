<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Program for General Botany By HOMER C. SAMPSON The Use of the Problem-Discussion Method in Teaching a Course in General Botany R ECENTLY, many botanists have faced the problem of im- proving the quality of teaching elementary botany. Some of them have prepared a basically new pro- gram; many others have retained the framework and point of view of the generally accepted course of the preceding generation with minor mod- ifications here and there, while some have avowed their satisfaction in con- tinuing the former course unaltered. Perhaps all of us have been unduly influenced by our profound respect for the great men of botanical science who sponsored the former courses. Prog- ress in the teaching of botany, how- ever, demands that we scrutinize their concepts of elementary botany by the same criteria and with as much candor as we employ in criticizing their con- cepts of the science of botany. Many of these former leaders of botanical instruction were so imbued with their achievements in systematiz- ing the study of the structures of plants from the point of view of evo- lution that through their influence elementary botany became restricted in outlook and almost synonymous with comparative morphology. They fostered the ideas that morphology constituted the bulk of fundamental botany, and offered the only approach to the study of the subject. As material for study, several plants considered as types that repre- sented an evolutionary series were selected from each of the plant groups, or phyla. The student was supposed to learn the structures and life history of each type and to con- sider the sequence of structural changes by which the different types supposedly arose in the process of evolution. He was directed to make observations and careful drawings of numerous structures which were then interpreted in lectures on the basis of some preferred system of phyloge- netic or race-history relationships. Since the evolutionary series deter- mined the order in which the types were studied, the student began with unfamiliar microscopic plants and con- tinued to study more or less unfamil- iar plants until almost the dose of the course. This order of procedure was some- times slightly altered to the extent that a few preliminary lessons on "structure and function" in seed plants preceded the work on the evolution- ary series. To the beginning student function is usually synonymous with purpose. Hence, the physiology that 127</page><page sequence="2">128 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION was included was mainly incidental when tested by the student's ability to use it in thinking and in solving prac- tical problems. His anthropomorphic concepts of the relations of the plant to the environment and his teleolog- ical phraseology remained unaltered. His opportunities of acquiring inclina- tions and abilities to seek or appreciate the relations of cause and effect under- lying plant behavior were minimized. He was allowed to come and go with little change in outlook and ideas. WAhen a student had successfully completed the course, he discovered that he had accumulated a certain amount of morphological data of in- terest in speculating about the origin and development of the plant king- dom, but which had a limited appli- cation to everyday life. Even his concepts of evolution based, as they were, almost wholly upon the consid- eration of structural relationships were greatly limited and biased by this one- sided attack. His concepts of heredity likewise were limited to structural phenomena. One must admit that this morphology course included im- portant discoveries that should be re- tained in any elementary course in botany, but for the students whose contacts with biological science are limited to a few quarters, or a few semesters, the course as a whole in- cluded too many things either of no value or of much less value and signif- icance than those it excluded. There have been individuals here and there, perhaps in every gen- eration, who neither accepted nor followed the program just outlined. Recently, the number of teachers dis- satisfied with the limited outlook of the past has increased. Plant phys- iologists, ecologists, geneticists, pa- thologists, and bacteriologists during the present century have made great advances, not only in developing their respective fields of botanical science, but also in the applications of botanical science to human welfare. Botanists who appreciate these advances desire to enrich the elementary course by making it a general course that centers about the activities of the plant as a whole, and includes in some organized unit the fundamental facts, principles, ideas, and methods of all phases of botany. Nor are they content with the mere passing on of information, thus leaving its applications to fate. They are more concerned that the students learn to use this information in acquir- ing new attitudes, new perspectives, and some independence in thinking critically about biological phenomena of fundamental importance to all. HIS shift in the idea of the course from the subject of mor- phology to the education of students through a study of the whole range of activities of living plants calls for a drastic reconstruction of the program for general botany: a reconstruction that involves a re-evaluation of objec- tives and of the means of reaching them. It includes not only the reselec- tion and reorganization of content, but also of the methods of classroom procedure. In the program of teaching which is here to be described structures and life histories still make up a part of the course, but they do not constitute the chief center of interest. Each of sev- eral major ideas is studied sufficiently</page><page sequence="3">A PROGRAM FOR GENERAL BOTANY I29 to give the student a fair concept of its significance, some ability in applying it to his own experiences, and a work- ing hypothesis or principle to build upon in the future. The method of teaching used is based upon the conviction that the manner of presenting a biological subject conditions the effects it has upon the student. The problem- discussion method of teaching decid- edly shows the failure of students to make intelligent use of biological in- formation in solving specific problems and in evaluating their judgments and ideas about living organisms, unless they are given considerable exercise and assistance in doing so. More time and emphasis, therefore, are given to teaching situations that give training in the use of information. This pro- cedure, in turn, has the desirable effect of limiting the information introduced into the course to the more generally useful and significant discoveries in botany. The employment of the prob- lem-discussion method in the presence of an abundance of illustrative mate- rials affords teaching situations that bring out facts and principles as con- crete realities. Physiological processes in particular are emphasized in contrast to their superficial treatment as "structure and function" in the former course. The study of physiology deals with rela- tions of cause and effect, and, when carried through to its applications, em- phasizes the importance of recogniz- ing causality throughout the realm of biology, thereby opening up new ideas for most elementary students. Let us review briefly how this greater emphasis on processes affects the student's outlook and encourages the use of his native reasoning ability in preference to his stock of ready- made answers learned in childhood. When a student has merely learned that a given process occurs in certain tissues, that it is necessary for life- even though it may not be-and that a particular plant grows in certain habitats, he has little information of problem-solving value. To have a usable concept of a physiological proc- ess he must also understand the nature of the process, how the process condi- tions the development of the plant, and how the process in turn is condi- tioned by each of several environ- mental factors. With this background he is in a position to study and discuss the underlying causal relations be- tween external conditions and the dif- ferences in behavior and distribution of a plant in different environments, whether the plant is in natural condi- tions or under cultivation. WQ[ CHILE the student is learning to discuss the processes outlined and to carry them through to their applications, many of his concepts of plants and plant activities are pro- foundly altered. He is assisted by his instructor in carrying over and apply- ing his knowledge of chemical and physical processes-oxidation and re- duction, diffusion, transformation of energy, and the like-to the solution of biological problems. Living organ- isms begin to appear to him less sharply differentiated from the inani- mate world. Some of the fundamental similarities of all living organisms also become evident. The student discov- ers plants doing many things that are</page><page sequence="4">130 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION not of survival value and may even not be advantageous to the plant. His understanding of fluctuations in plant development on the basis of causality offers a reasonable substitute for many of his erroneous notions of purposeful adaptations. He soon be- gins to see that he has been both mak- ing and accepting statements about plants that ascribe to the plant not only a complete knowledge of its own physiology and of its relations to its surroundings, but also the ability to take thought and add one cubit after another to the stature of any of its organs. He is required to alter his phraseology so that he may make statements of fact without at the same time implying a doubtful theory. He learns to derive definitions from a factual basis, and thus acquires a crit- ical terminology that may be used with some discernment in discussion. He gradually becomes aware of the fact that information and the applica- tion of scientific procedure are just as necessary in investigating and inter- preting biological processes as they are in interpreting the phenomena of his physical environment. Most of the students have to relearn this fact re- peatedly, as new phases of plant activity are encountered before the concepts of causality and the scientific method become generally useful tools to them in botany. When the course was limited to morphology, the students did not acquire the habit of using these concepts in reasoning about many phases of plant behavior. The students usually prize this intelli- gent awakening to new views of the behavior of living organisms far more highly than the specific information about plants which they acquire dur- ing the course. Furthermore, this awakening is one of the distinct con- tributions of a scientific study of the behavior of plants or of animals to the general education of the student. A STUDY of physiological proc- 11 esses as just outlined, if inter- preted as botanical subjects, involves a study of anatomy, physiology, and ecology, including many applications to practical life. If interpreted in terms of biological phenomena, it in- volves the study of the physiology of development and of fluctuations in development under different external conditions. Later in the course, when the student meets problems in hered- ity and evolution, he learns to regard these fluctuations as differences in the expression of genetic potentialities of the individual, and he thus obtains a clearer concept of the limitations im- posed upon the behavior of a plant by its heredity. When the present program of teaching general botany was initiated at Ohio State University in I9I7, more than 8o per cent of the enroll- ment in our general course consisted of students from the colleges of ag- riculture and pharmacy who were required to take botany. The enroll- ment in general botany last year from the four colleges which supply most of our students was: Education, 358; Arts, 30I; Agriculture, 267; Com- merce, 223. Two other colleges were also represented by smaller numbers. The actual number enrolled is not significant, since it is limited and controlled by the facilities of the department.</page><page sequence="5">A PROGRAM FOR GENERAL BOTANY 13I About two-thirds of these students are Freshmen, one-fifth Sophomores, the remaining i2 to I per cent are upperclassmen. On the basis of what their predecessors did, we may expect about 9 per cent of them to take one additional quarter of work in botany, between 4 and 5 per cent to take one year, between i and 2 per cent to take two years, and less than i per cent to take three years of additional work in botany. Less than .5 per cent will take the Doctor's degree in botany. It is quite evident from these data that we do not need to be concerned in our general botany course with the objective of developing professional botanists, but rather with the best means of contributing to a general education of all of these students through the medium of botany. There is, also, no reason why we should be concerned in the general course with the objective of prepar- ing students for any particular ad- vanced course in botany. Instructors of the advanced courses should adapt their courses to the students who come to them from the general course. When the present general course got under way, the instructors of advanced courses had to revise their courses, not downward, but upward. The former elementary morphology course was accordingly revised and placed upon a par with other advanced courses for special students. WQ WITHOUT pausing to give a historical account of the changes we have made during the past thir- teen years, the program as it exists today will be described. We have a two-quarter course of about 100 classroom hours. The students are registered by sections, not exceeding 36 students per section. Each section meets for one hour each day of the five-hour week. Since three class- rooms are equipped for general bot- any, we may take care of a maximum of io8 students each hour of the day. The student finds on his table in the laboratory a microscope, a micro- scope light, a box of numbered slides, and all the plants or parts of plants he will use that day. For a few of the exercises preserved and dried speci- mens are used, but living specimens are the rule. If the particular lesson involves a study of some complicated structure, the student has in his note- book a set of drawings and diagrams obtained from the printer. The in- structor's table is similarly supplied with the same equipment and mate- rials. Hence, both students and in- structor are free for the hour to carry on observation and discussion. On another day, the assistant may provide one or more demonstration- experiments as a basis of discussion, or the class may meet in the greenhouse or in the field. Then a day arrives when we have a discussion of prob- lems that can be solved by recalling and evaluating the data we have ac- cumulated during a series of previous lessons. In this plan of five hours per week we have not eliminated the laboratory method, neither have we curtailed learning by observation. We have saved time in the classroom by having the graduate assistants prepare an abundance of materials that clearly illustrate the phenomena under dis- cussion, by having all of the material</page><page sequence="6">I3 2 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION for each lesson within easy reaching distance of the student when he ar- rives at his table, by having all the instructions of a given section under the same instructor, and finally by eliminating the time formerly given to drawing and the inking of drawings by the student. We eliminated drawing exercises while the course still included seven hours per week, because we believed that the majority of students could spend their time more profitably in further observation, demonstra- tion, and discussion. Our experience of conducting the laboratory and field work as a discussion in the pres- ence of materials suggested the advisability of placing all of the work of the course on that basis. It not only seemed to be a more effective method of teaching, but it also allowed us to abandon the formal separation of quiz and laboratory on different days of the week and thereby obtain continuity in observation and discus- sion. The intensive study and con- tinuous attention required of the students by this method of instruction made it necessary to abandon two- hour class periods. We have not found the elimination of drawing exercises to detract either from the amount or the accuracy of observation by the student. On the contrary, it has increased his interest in observation. The instructor and students study the material together, both asking and answering questions. If some technical point is difficult for the student to grasp, a glance at the diagrams is often helpful. The stu- dent does not have to wait until to- morrow or next week to learn whether his observations were correctly made. The instructor is relieved of the thankless task of correcting endless drawings and labels at some later date. Perhaps the diagrams with appropri- ate notes would serve equally well if they were in the textbook. As a matter of fact, only about one-third of the lessons we teach deal with plant structures for which diagrams are gen- erally considered to be needed. W RTHEN one has the whole field of botany as a background and employs the discussion method of teaching, he, of course, teaches several types of lessons and asks many types of questions. An analysis of this pro- cedure would lead too far into detail. There are, however, two general types of teaching situations which we try to create that will serve to indicate both the basis of organization of the con- tent of the course and also some of the methods of conducting discussions. One type of teaching situation, which for convenience of further ref- erence may be called the develop- mental type, is used as a means of initiating problems or projects. The instructor usually begins by asking a leading question which has previ- ously called for considerable thought either on his part or on the part of some of his associates. The question frequently asks for the fundamental fact, principle, or explanation which he expects to become the objective of a problem, or even of a project, to be worked out with the class. The instructor knows from experi- ence that the students will not answer the question either correctly or com- pletely, but he gives them the oppor-</page><page sequence="7">A PROGRAM FOR GENERAL BOTANY I33 tunity of expressing all of their ideas upon the subject. This procedure exposes common misconceptions that interfere with the student's attack on the problem, or even prevents him from seeing that a problem exists. Any given class usually proposes a number of answers. Sometimes the correct answer is given, but it does not interfere with the discussion. The one who proposes it has usually bor- rowed it, is thus unable to defend it, and, to his later chagrin, often tem- porarily abandons it for another dur- ing the preliminary discussion. All of the answers that are not eliminated by a preliminary discus- sion are now before the class as hypotheses, and will be dealt with according to the usual methods of dealing with hypotheses as additional data become available. Previous ex- perience has already given the in- structor a list of all the hypotheses the class will propose. He, therefore, works out his general program of pro- cedure before the class convenes. If the data necessary for the solu- tion of the problem are available in the greenhouse, botanic garden, or field, and are of such kinds that the students may work upon the problem individually or in groups, the problem becomes an outside assignment. If the students are unable to agree upon the most probable hypothesis by the following day, the assignment is ex- tended to a later time when they are able to agree. Many valuable assign- ments of this sort can be made if the department is well supplied with field and greenhouse space in which plants may be grown under experimental conditions. Furthermore, it is per- haps one of the most effective ways of reducing the time now used for teach- ing information during the class period. Most of the problems are handled as a class discussion under the direct guidance of the instructor. The prob- lem may be such that all of the observations, experimentation, and dis- cussion necessary to solve it may be completed in a single class period, or a series of periods may be required. The assistant, therefore, will have prepared all of the observation ma- terial and demonstration-experiments to be used by the class, and the in- structor will have obtained from the literature, frequently with the help of his associates, a record of the criti- cal data needed to supplement the observations of the class. S EVERAL other methods are used L as an approach to developmen- tal teaching. I shall mention but one more. We may wish to develop a teaching situation in which the data needed are numerous and somewhat technical and should be presented to the student in a definite sequence. It may be advisable to waive the pre- liminary discussion and by some simple observation, demonstration, or report of an experiment lead the stu- dents into some minor phase of it, and subsequently into other minor prob- lems until the final goal is reached. Then we ask a series of questions de- signed to give the students a choice either of recalling and using the data they have just accumulated or of fall- ing back upon their preconceived ideas. Such class exercises usually result in lively discussions. They, also, show that the students need</page><page sequence="8">134 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION much assistance in seeing the incon- sistencies between their fund of new information and their previous con- cepts of plant behavior. An instructor in general botany who limits his ob- jectives to the passing on of informa- tion greatly increases the number of inconsistencies in the student's mind. The solution of problems brought up by the developmental method helps the student acquire the habit of using the scientific method of reason- ing about biological phenomena. The student also gradually acquires a valu- able fund of usable information. Con- tinued use of this information in later discussions throughout the course im- presses him of its value far more effectively than the statement that it is often called for in examinations. He acquires much of the information either first hand or from the records of experiments, and begins to feel less dependent upon hearsay and question- able authority. After the students have successfully solved a few prob- lems, they begin to become aware of certain abilities that have been lying dormant under the bondage of mis- information, misconceptions, and un- trustworthy methods of reaching conclusions about living organisms. A sense of freedom and confidence is awakened, and they begin to enjoy their new experiences in the classroom. THE information acquired in the solution of a problem by the de- velopmental method makes it possible to bring up a second type of teaching situation, which for the convenience of further reference may be called the evaluation type. We may now ask questions involving problem-solving, classified summaries, definitions, ex- planations, or the making of judg- ments, that can be answered wholly or in part by recalling, selecting, and using the facts previously learned. Here again the instructor may some- times have to supplement the data already acquired by the student. In fact, he may deliberately plan a situa- tion that gives an appropriate setting for supplementing the information of the students on a particular topic. As soon as the students show rea- sonable efficiency in using the data acquired, we initiate another problem or project by means of the develop- mental method, obtain the necessary data, and arrive at conclusions. This increases the background of facts and conclusions that are used as a basis for questions discussed by the evalua- tion method. As the course proceeds we can greatly increase the number and variety of such questions and can propose more and more complex situ- ations to be analyzed. Many of these questions may also be directed to help- ing the student carry over his training in botany to some of its applications in everyday life and in related fields of study. Considerable experience and judg- ment are necessary in deciding which teaching situations and problems should be handled by the develop- mental method and which by the evaluation method. As a general rule, we choose for the developmental method those problems whose solution involve the acquiring and organization of the more basic and frequently used data and conclusions of the course. The order in which the different problems are brought up is an im-</page><page sequence="9">A PROGRAM FOR GENERAL BOTANY T35 portant factor, both in the effective- ness of teaching and in the amount of teaching that can be accomplished in a given time. We try to follow the principle that when many difficulties are to be met the easiest difficulties should be encountered first, particu- larly if they prepare the way for more difficult ones. And second, the basic facts and conclusions that are most frequently used throughout the course either directly, or as an as- sumed background, should be devel- oped as soon as possible. A general consideration of any one of several complex problems, such as evolution, protoplasm, ways in which mineral elements affect internal conditions and processes of plants, fundamental similarities in plants and animals, and the like, involves so many facts and concepts that it is held patiently in the background by the in- structor during the earlier part of the course. Preparation for a general consideration of such problems is in- termittently, but definitely, made by the solution of minor appropriate and contributory problems. Then at stated periods in the course, when the stu- dents have a sufficient background to take an active part in the discussion of any one of these complicated prob- lems, it is handled effectively by the recall-evaluation method of discus- sion. One of the chief rewards of teaching is attained when the students of a class can discuss such problems intelligently. In other words, the in- structor should know where he expects to take the student from time to time, and, also, an interesting and effective way of getting them there. In the autumn the preliminary work of the first three days prepares the student so that he may independ- ently learn to recognize and name about one hundred fifty common plants of garden, field, and forest that are frequently referred to later in the course. This work with related minor outdoor problems is continued indi- vidually, or in groups, by the students until frost intervenes. IN THE classroom we begin with problems using physico-chemical analysis of biological processes (food manufacture, respiration, assimilation, translocation, water relations, and the like), as they are related to the envi- ronmental factors that affect them and to the resultant differences in behavior (fluctuations) of the plants when growing in different environments. These processes furnish the greatest number of the simplest types of prob- lems that may be carried through to their applications in the experiences of the students, and, furthermore, botan- ical literature now has a wealth of experimental data that may be used in solving such problems. Later, problems involving a biological analy- sis make up a considerable part of the discussions; that is, situations in which the solution of problems or the mak- ing of judgments involves the analysis of the relations of numerous struc- tures and biological processes. During our general botany course of about 20 weeks, I5.5 weeks are devoted almost wholly to the study of the common seed plants, their structure, physiological processes, re- lations to environmental factors, re- production, heredity, and variations. Algae and fungi are also used in some</page><page sequence="10">136 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION of the demonstration-experiments. With this background, two weeks are spent in finding out how the non- green plants (bacteria and fungi) live, and how their activities affect the rest of the world. During the next two weeks, algae, mosses, ferns, and coni- fers are studied. A summary discus- sion of the ideas of evolution and related topics occupies the remaining days of the course. T HE development of this pro- gram of teaching general botany to its present status was based largely upon judgments such as may be made by any group of instructors who criti- cally evaluate their objectives and have sufficient facilities for trying out different methods of teaching. Al- though experimental sections have been used to a limited extent, educa- tional measurements have not been carried to the point of statistical accu- racy. Our judgments have been based largely upon the daily reactions of the student during the discussions rather than upon formal tests. This proce- dure, however, fails to leave a record of data that may conveniently be passed on to others. We have given considerable atten- tion to the planning of objective tests that not only call for information, but also test the student's ability to make use of the information he has acquired. With the assistance of the Bureau of Educational Research we began this year to construct comprehensive ob- jective examinations of a diagnostic character by which we hope to measure each of several abilities of the students and the relative progress in each of these abilities as the course proceeds. In this paper I have tried merely to indicate some of our present ideas and practices in the teaching of gen- eral botany. We have eliminated certain features of the former elemen- tary course, such as formal lectures, formal separation of laboratory and quiz on separate days of the week, two-hour class periods, drawing exer- cises, the study of structures and struc- tural relations of interest only to the special student, and the idea that we are making botanists, or preparing students for some particular advanced course in botany. Our objectives center about the study of the activities of living plants and the making of distinct contribu- tions to the general education of all of the students. We have tried to make an appropriate and valuable orientation course whether or not the student takes further work in botany. A two-quarter course in any biological subject is much too limited for even the best students to reach that degree of independence in biology necessary for the study of such subjects as agri- culture, education, psychology, and the social sciences. They are not only deficient in information and ideas, but they will continue to need assistance in carrying over what biological back- ground they do have. It is perhaps obvious that the teach- ing of general botany by the program I have outlined here is both an enj oy- able and a difficult job. Every mem- ber of the staff faces the two endless tasks of keeping in touch with the progress of botanical science and its applications and of deciding what and how to teach. We expect, therefore, never to reach a condition of stasis. [Vol. II, No. 3]</page></plain_text>
