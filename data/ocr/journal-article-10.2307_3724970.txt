<plain_text><page sequence="1">need to pay at least as much attention to purposeful departures from the norm as to its conventional acceptance, above all in the case of a poet such as Wolfram. In a critical review of Dr Blamires's book precisely this point was made in conclusion by Dr L. P. Johnson, so that here at least three English Germanists are in agreement in doubting the justification of an approach which seeks to stress the typical at the cost of individualizing features. D. H. GREEN CAMBRIDGE Der Traum Herzeloydes und der rote Ritter: Erwdgungen iiber die Bedeutung des staufisch- welfischen Thronstreitesfiir Wolframs 'Parzival'. By RUDOLF ROSSKOPF. (G6ppin- ger Arbeiten zur Germanistik, 89) G6ppingen: Kiimmerle. I972. 40I pp. DM 46. The argument of this book, originally a Munich dissertation, proceeds from a radically new interpretation of Herzeloyde's dream and leads the author to a drastic revision of the conventional laudatory appraisal of this figure and ultimately to a similar revision of King Arthur himself, who is presented as sharing responsibility for Ither's death. What makes it difficult to do justice to this book is the fact that this reviewer shares the opinion that a negative sketch of Herzeloyde's actions could indeed be given and that Wolfram does express reservations about the conventional Arthurian ideal at numerous points, but that he cannot accept the excesses of an argument which equates Herzeloyde with the Whore of Babylon and proposes an apocalyptic interpretation of Parzival and the Round Table as ushering in the rule of Antichrist. A critical dismissal of this work's total argument would demand more space than the editor is likely to permit, so that I shall confine my remarks to the two themes given in the title, assuming that Dr Rosskopf would acknowledge that a rejection of his argument on these two scores amounts to a rejection of the further arguments that build on this. The interpretation of Herzeloyde's dream occupies fully I40 pages and is broken down into various sections in which key lines of Wolfram's depiction are analysed at length. One may have one's doubts about so detailed an interpretation which yet finds it superfluous to discuss Deinert's rival argument (and the ready use of 'offenbar' on page 7 in dismissing Deinert does little to allay these doubts), but in addition I find myself unable to accept the author's line of reasoning in almost all these sections. The first section discusses 104, 8, but all too readily equates the gold and jewels traditionally associated with the griffin with secular kingship (without considering other possibilities such as theft, greed, usury) and happily minimizes the reading of zeswe hant as 'my other self' by dogmatically claiming this to be no more than a secondary meaning (page 33, footnote I). In the second section (devoted to o03, 28 f.) the symbolism of ein sternen blic is derived from folklore evidence of the Siebenbiirger-Sachsen and of the nineteenth and early twentieth century (made relevant by being seen as characteristic of pre-industrial society at large), whilst the sky is regarded as a place of darkness and eternal punishment on the basis of a tradition deriving from Persian religious beliefs (with no reference to the equally possible belief in hell as a place of subterranean darkness). In another section (103, 25 f.) Rosskopf's reading rests on the words umb einen mitten tac, which he connects symbolically with two other events in Parzival which take place at the same time of day, without asking whether such references may be fortuitous or must be sym- bolically significant. Moreover, on the grounds that Herzeloyde's first husband Castis (for the author a symbolic allusion to castus) died before the consummation of their marriage, we are meant to believe that Herzeloyde had lost her kiusche in Reviews 220</page><page sequence="2">leaving Grail-territory (p. 66) - despite the fact that Rosskopf elsewhere argues that she lost her kiusche after his death in not returning to the Grail. The three feudal kingdoms which Parzival's mother acquires on the death of her two husbands are readily equated with the three kingdoms of Daniel's dream in the Kaiserchronik in order to yield the view that she too must be guilty of superbia, putting herself up against God. The same conclusion is drawn on the equally shaky ground that, since every ternary number indicates God, Herzeloyde must resemble Lucifer in wishing to be like God (p. 76) - here one would like to know whether the author would also propose a critical reading of Walther's poem on Philip of Swabia at Magdeburg (and if not, on what grounds he distinguishes between positive and negative readings of a ternary number). Later, Wolfram's reference to the wurm (I 04, I I) is equated, not as usually with the trache, but with the serpent of Genesis - but this equation is made on the basis of specifically biblical parallels, whereas we can have no certainty that Parzival, a religious work with a secular theme, must necessarily use wurm in the same narrowly biblical sense. If the parallel between Parzival and wurm need not imply a Genesis situation, the further parallel between Herzeloyde and Eve (together with the negative view of Parzival's mother this implies) loses all cogency. In discussing what is termed Herzeloyde's 'repentance' the author uses the lines 113, 15 f. to imply that she has now abandoned her earlier losheit in favour of diemuot, but since these lines could equally well be taken to describe the same condition (of Herzeloyde at this one point of time) from comp- lementary points of view, we need to be told why this is not so and why losheit must apply to Herzeloyde's previous behaviour. These random examples from the opening chapter are meant to show how little critical attention is paid to alternative possibilities of interpretation, how readily a possibility is converted into a certainty and a string of further conclusions drawn from it. What follows in the remaining chapters is none too different, but although they at least also yield some positive results, the weaknesses of this opening chapter are crucial, since it claims to lay the foundation for the rest of the book. Yet there are still important weaknesses in the second chapter, devoted to Parzi- val's encounter with Ither and his adoption of his victim's knightly gear, where I find myself in radical disagreement with the totally unredeemed view of Arthur which is offered us. To stress Arthur's guilt, the author quotes three passages (p. I6I) meant to signify that the king granted Parzival Ither's equipment, but fails to observe that two of these present the episode from Parzival's point of view (and therefore have no necessary objective validity) and that something similar could also be true of 150, 27 (see Marti's note on this line in her edition). Admittedly, Arthur is here depicted in an ironic light, but the result is no more than to show him up as a weak and fain6ant ruler, anxious to be rid of Ither (in the innocuous sense). When Rosskopf takes his criticism of Arthur to severe extremes, accusing him of a guilt equal to the hero's, one may reply by asking how the king can expect to win back the goblet through Parzival (p. 162) when he also fears that Parzival will be killed. Furthermore, by seeing Arthur in purely black colours the author loses sight of the distinction between the killer knights whom he later discusses and the knights of the Round Table (none of whom is depicted in the narrative as actually killing an opponent) and of the equally vital fact that Parzival himself is the only knight in the whole work to belong to both circles, to those who brutally kill their opponents and also to those who magnanimously spare them. This is not the occasion on which to treat this aspect of Parzival in detail, but my point may perhaps be made in the form of a question: if, as Rosskopf suggests, Arthurian knighthood is no different from that of an Orilus or Liihelin, why does Karnahkarnanz, who acknowledges Arthur's authority and recommends Parzival to him, represent a positive ideal of knightly compassion shown to those in need? What the book under review gives us Reviews 22I</page><page sequence="3">is an interpretation in which Wolfram does not just gently mock, but rather criti- cizes with extreme harshness all his major characters - the result is a view of the work in which the poet loses most of his warmth and humanity, becoming much less recognizable in the process than the poet of whom Wolfgang Mohr, with a finer sense of nuances, said: 'Ich bringe es nicht fertig, Parzival und Gawan auf verschiedene sittliche oder religi6se Prinzipien zu reduzieren'. This does not mean that this work, however mistaken in conception I take it to be, has no positive points at all. These are present both in detail (e.g. p. 58, foot- note 2: the point about an anthropomorphic view of God, or pp. 91 f.: the influence of the Apocalypse on the Kaiserchronik, v. 7938 if.) and on the larger scale. As examples of the latter I should include above all those passages where Rosskopf compares particular episodes in Parzival with corresponding passages in Hartmann's Erec, demonstrating both that Wolfram borrows from this work as much as from Iwein and also that his intentions were so different as to amount to a parody of his predecessor's chivalric idealism. If the author had remained content with this level of interpretation and had not taken his argument to the extremes we in fact encounter, his work could have been given more undiluted praise, since it is in these comparative passages that he shows both insight and an ability to pose new questions. As it is, these positive points have to be extracted from a framework argument which, in order to be at all acceptable, would have to employ a more rigorous logic than we in fact find. If this review in its turn appears to run to an extreme length in criticizing a dissertation of this nature, my plea must be that these positive points in the work deserve to be rescued and that it is even more necessary to emphasize that a fruitful theme such as Wolfram's reservations about the Arthurian ideal should not be abandoned and ignored because it has here been treated in an unsatisfactory way.

That Wolfram's Parzival has for too long diverted scholarly attention from the poet's other works is a fact well known and often lamented and has been recently confirmed by Professor Bumke's critical survey of Wolfram scholarship in which he finds it necessary to devote more than four times as much space to research on Parzival as to contributions on the remaining works. This regrettable onesidedness may be slowly changing, as witness Bumke's own work on Willehalm and Wap- newski's recent analysis of the lyrics, so that the two contributions under review may be welcomed as part of the overdue process of rectifying the balance. If they are largely factual, sober, and even conservative in their scholarly approach, this is not a criticism of them, but no less than what we urgently need before further work can be reliably undertaken. Professor Lofmark will have nothing to do with a self-crippling hermetic ap- proach to Willehalm, for he is laudably aware of the irreducible debt of German medieval poets to their sources (an insightwhich comes well from one who has recently written so illuminatingly in this journal on Wolfram's sources in Parzival). Accordingly, he devotes an opening chapter to the origins of the figure of Rennewart (rejecting two possible historical explanations and opting instead for fairytale Reviews 222</page></plain_text>
