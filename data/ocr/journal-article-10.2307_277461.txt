<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS reports range from a two-volume synthesis of Central Californian archaeology to the short Papers on California Archaeology, several of which may appear in the same volume. The reader will be impressed with the extensive bibliographies that each paper includes. Every paper is further characterized by the most careful referencing. The research of these California scholars has been most thorough. Along with the reports on the archaeology of an area they include a wealth of information on the ethnography of the historic aboriginal inhabitants, on physical type, on natural history, on whatever may be pertinent. Volume 31 is an index through 1955, which further adds to the usefulness of the series. Though this series is invaluable to the student of California archae- ology its value does not end there. Students of the Great Basin will profit by the interest the University of California has had in that area. Those concerned with the problem of the antiquity of man in the New World will find several provocative articles. All archaeologists will be interested in the papers dealing with methodology. It is difficult to choose specific articles to draw to the reader's attention. The few mentioned are illustrative of the range of the series. A Bibliography of Ancient Man in California, No. 2, 1948, compiled and edited by Robert F. Heizer, is the first of several excellent bibliographies in the series. A thorough discussion of the whole problem of early man in California precedes the bibliography. The author concludes that although the existence of early man in the area is probable and some finds seem to indicate it, no completely authenticated, unquestionable discovery of early man has yet been made in California. The bibliog- raphy, which is complete through 1948, lists the refer- ences for each site together, and gives annotations when comments are helpful to clearer understanding. Molluscan Species in California Shell Middens, No. 13, 1951, by Robert E. Greengo, should be of interest to all who have ever dug in shell middens. Greengo has shown by quantitative analyses of refuse deposits that there are variations through time in the proportions of different molluscan species in the San Francisco Bay shellmounds. He has further suggested that this variation may well be correlated with a rise in sea level. Samples having a constant volume were taken from each mound on a vertical plane. These were sorted and weighed and the proportions of the components calculated. This analysis revealed the changing proportions of molluscan species. Gravel Pictographs of the Lower Colorado River Re- gion, No. 20, 1953, by Michael J. Hamer, is an example of one of the shorter papers of the series. Harner takes up a discussion of the curious anthropomorphic and theriomorphic alignments of gravel occurring along the Lower Colorado River. The location of all known sites, their description, reports of earlier observers, ethnog- raphic information, speculations as to their purpose, drawings, and photographs are all included. Temporal and Areal Relationship, in Central Cali- fornia Archaeology, Nos. 24-25, 1954, by Richard K. Beardsley, is the longest article in the series and in many respects the most central. It is an ambitious attempt to synthesize the archaeology of Central California. By Central California the author means the area around San Francisco Bay, Marin County to the north, and the Sacramento Valley to the east. Three cultural horizons, the Early, Middle and Late, are established for this area, which is divided into two areal zones, the Littoral and the Interior. The archaeological remains are divided into Components which represent human occupancy at a single location at a specific time. Components are grouped into Facies, which are vaguely defined as groups of intimately related components. Facies are grouped into Provinces, which are geographic units. I found this classification to be somewhat cumbersome. However, the material remains are carefully described. Sonoma Mission - An Historical and Archaeological Study of Primary Constructions, 1823-1913, No. 27, 1954, by James A. Bennyhoff and Albert B. Elsasser, sum- marizes excavations within the quadrangle area at Son- oma Mission. The remains of a structure were unearthed. A complete description of the finds and a reconstruction of the original appearance of the Mission, illustrated by easily read charts and drawings, forms the bulk of the report. Included are a discussion of all previous references to the Mission and early drawings and photographs of it. The recollections of the Mission by an early resident of Sonoma appear as an appendix. Archaeological Radiocarbon Dates from California and Nevada by Robert F. Heizer and Gordon L. Grosscup; Some Archaeological Sites in Western Nevada by Nor- man L. Roust, Martin A. Baumhoff, and Albert B. Elsas- ser, No. 44, 1958. Part I of this number is composed of two articles. In the first Heizer lists and discusses radio- carbon dates from California. Grosscup does the same for radiocarbon dates from Nevada. A discussion of the context and significance of questionable dates makes this report much more useful than the usual unannotated date list. Part II contains three short articles describing three sites in Western Nevada. The Aboriginal Population of the Great Basin, No. 45, by K. A. R. Kennedy, 1959. This report, the most recent of the series, deals with the physical anthropology of this area. Kennedy has brought together published data on skeletal material and on living subjects. To these he has added a description of the Great Basin skeletal material in the Museum of Anthropology at Berkeley. Space prevents an adequate review of the whole series. All students of archaeology, whatever their spe- cialties, will profit from a perusal of these Reports. MARY ELIZABETH SHUTLER University of Arizona Tucson, Ariz. Mixtec Ethnohistory, A Method of Analysis of the Codical Art. PHILIP DARK. Oxford University Press, London, 1958. 61 pp., 7 figs., 2 tables. $4.80. In his study of Mixtec codices Dark presents what he terms a new methodological approach to the study of 283</page><page sequence="2">284 AMERICAN codices. In so doing he selects the Zouche-Nuttall group to demonstrate the application of his method - codices the content of which is not completely understood. In assessing their probable content he rejects the view of Seler, that the subject matter is largely religious or mytho- logical, and inclines more to the view of Cooper-Clark, Long, Spinden, and Caso, that the content is historical and genealogical. As an application of his methodological procedure, he works out the genealogical pattern of the Codex Selden and the Codex Bodley. Dark labels his procedure the Ideographic-Iconographi- cal Method, which, in effect, is two systems of analysis. The first, the Ideographic method, is "a form of short- hand representation of the subject matter." The method entails three stages of analysis. As the first stage, individ- ual glyphs or glyph relationships (male, female, name, place, posture) are reduced to symbols (lines, directional lines, wavy lines, arrows) which become Dark's ideo- graphs. As places, persons, dates, and so forth, are com- bined to constitute a configuration or a scene in the codex, so, too, Dark combines his separate symbols. The second stage of analysis is really a second level of abstraction whereby the ideographic symbols are re- duced to other more manageable symbols (numbers and letters). Thus, on encircled 1 represents "a female and a male sitting on a place facing each other." In the third stage assumptions are made as to the meaning of the abstracted ideographs. In short, the ideo- graphic record yields patterns, and the patterns yield meaning. For example, it is assumed that the relationship expressed by the ideograph for a female and a male sitting on a place, facing each other, is that of a married couple. A second assumption is that individuals connected to a couple by an umbilical cord are children of that couple. A third assumption is that footsteps leading from a couple to the partner of another couple indicate that that individ- ual is the child of the first couple. In tabulating the gen- ealogies of the Codex Selden, Dark discovers a patterned variation in the place of origin of the footsteps leading to an individual. A different meaning is postulated for this variation of pattern, that is, three generations (grand- parent, parent, and child) are indicated rather than two (parent and child). Dark then proceeds to demonstrate that the new pattern indicates three generations by a con- sideration of attendant date glyphs. The Iconographic Method, or the Aspect Sheet sys- tem, resulted from Dark's work with the Human Rela- tions Area Files at Yale University. An internally punched card was devised which locates a glyph element as it occurs on the pages of three related codices. As an exam- ple, if the punched card, here termed Aspect Sheet, for the number six as an element in a name glyph is com- bined with the card for monkey as an element in the name glyph of a woman, the location of a woman or women named Six Monkey is immediate. Also assump- tions as to meaning can be coded and tested. Dark forms the hypothesis that the relationship expressed by the ideo- graph M followed by the encircled 1 (the left hand per- son only of a couple seated on a 'marriage mat') in the Codex Bodley is that of a married couple and is the same ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 25, No. 2, 1959 as the ideograph, encircled 1, in the Codex Selden. By the manipulation of the aspect sheets he demonstrates that this correspondence is valid. Dark asserts that his method, when applied to the analysis of historical codices, is a more objective approach which facilitates "the discovery of the patterns of rela- tionships suggested by the visual impressions of the vari- ous symbols depicted." The method has merit, and limited application in the decipherment of codices. However, it is most effective when used by investigators such as Dark who already possess a working familiarity with codex con- tent. Most effective results are obtained for shorter time periods, perhaps three centuries. In the remote past, where history and myth merge, genealogical patterns be- come blurred. He is cognizant of this when he states that "in the first ten pages of the codex there are some eleven, possibly ten, unrelated blocks of genealogies, whereas in the last ten pages there is one block of related personages." Because of Caso's already published studies of the gen. ealogies in the Mixtec codices, Dark is able to compare the results of his method with Caso's "subjective" method. It is difficult to see how the superiority of the new method is demonstrated when Caso's time calculations are cited as substantiation (pp. 31, 32, 51). Disagreement with Caso's number of generations and dates seems to be based on whether a generation is to be reckoned as 20 or 25 years, rather than on the merits of the two methods (pp. 9, 31). Finally, the unique events of the historical codices are not likely to be filtered out by the discovery of pat- terns of relationship. CHARLES E. DIBBLE University of Utah Salt Lake City, Utah The Archaeological Ceramics of Yucatan. GEORGE W. BRAINERD. Anthropological Records, Vol. 19. Uni- versity of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1958. iii+378 pp., 113 figs., 3 pls., 24 maps and plans, 24 charts. Cloth $8.00, paper $6.00. For many years students in the field of Maya archae- ology have been awaiting the publication of the work of George Brainerd on the pottery of Yucatan, with the knowledge that it was a study both broad and ex- haustive that would fill a great gap in knowledge. Since 1927 when Vaillant presented his thesis on Maya pottery, which remains unpublished, there has been no specific study on the ceramics of Yucatan. In contrast, there have been numerous adequate monographs on the ar- chitecture of the region. It was known that Henry Roberts had collected an enormous quantity of ceramic material from Chichen Itza, the Puuc region, Yaxuni, Coba, and Holactuin, but his study was never finished. It was known also that Brainerd had begun his research nearly 20 years ago and that the work was virtually completed long ago. For these reasons the University of California has made a great contribution in publishing the important work of this brilliant investigator. Brainerd had the satisfaction of knowing that the results of his I</page></plain_text>
