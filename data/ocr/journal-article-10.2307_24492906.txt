But "pressures of modernization" and, most recently, government-sponsored Islamization have made inroads into these beliefs and practices. Just as the crocodile has been driven to the edge of extinction in Brunei rivers by hunters from other ethnic groups, so also is the survival of Dusun religion now questionable in the face of cultural inroads originating not only from economic development but from the limitless pretensions of the state. This essay presents in some detail a ritual which has remained immune to the impact of Islam among its performers to date. As the myths continue to fall into oblivion, the temarok buayo remains a context where the traditionally intimate relationship between the crocodile and Dusuns is still celebrated. Introduction The Dusuns of Brunei, concentrated most heavily in the Tutong District, and numbering at little under 10,000,2 constitute the largest non-Muslim indigenous minority of the state. Since the Muruts of Temburong were extensively, if not totally, Christianized during the past half-century, the Dusuns (and barely distinguishable Bisayas) remain the only indigenous group maintaining an ancient Bornean religion in vital form.3 But "pressures of modernization" and, most recently, government sponsored Islamization under the state ideology of "M.I.B."/4 have made inroads into these beliefs and practices. The transient outsider thus feels an obligation, primarily, to record for posterity a phenomenon which faces oblivion. This is indeed the main purpose of the study, which focuses by way of descriptive illustration on a major ritual of the religion. It is not our purpose on this occasion to discuss at any great length the degree of correspondence between the Dusun ritual leaders — the female belian5 — and the "shamans" of recent anthropological literature; nor to delve deeply into questions of "marginality", whether of the belian in their own group, or of the religious complex as a whole in the context of Bruneian Islam. Nevertheless, in writing for a sociological journal we assume an audience among whom, ipso facto, these are issues of current interest. It would thus be courteous as well as constructive to acknowledge the important and inspiring work in these areas, and to attempt — modestly in every sense — to relate the present material to it.</page><page sequence="2">2 • Eva Maria Kerslww and Roger Kershaw Taking, first of all, the concept of "shaman", it goes almost without saying that it can only have validity across various regional and cultural contexts if not defined in a way that is highly specific to the regional and cultural context which gave rise to its original employment as a tool of anthropology, let alone specific to the analytical apprdach of any pioneering ethnographer. And yet, a highly eclectic and open-minded approach to "The shaman's career" (Lewis, 1996:105-21) perhaps risks being taken too far in the other direction, in as much as earlier analytical distinctions between "possession", "spirit mediumship" and "shamanism" (the latter being characterized inflexibly by "control" over spirits, while possession is not) may become subsumed in a single, implicit phenomenon of universal shamanism, overlooking the subtleties of particular manifestations. With regard to the Dusun belian of Brunei, we would certainly equate them with "shamans" in their capacity to embark on a three-stage "career", starting initially as controllers of incarnable spirits, albeit not exclusively;6 then graduating — through divine selection — to mediumship between the divine and human worlds, acting as vessels through which the spirits manifest themselves on the one hand, and as representatives, agents and petitioners for their fellow humans on the other; and moving finally, if the deities so wish, to the position of diviners and physicians in life-restoring and healing rituals. Yet, on the other hand, one might search very far and wide before finding this precise progression replicated elsewhere.7 It has to be emphasized that a Dusun belian never becomes a complete "master" of spirits nor lays claim to personal achievement or authority, in the most "classic" shamanistic sense. Although she is able to summon her familiar spirit whenever she chooses, or may, if she has advanced to the position of a powerful healer, even command a spirit other than her familiar to unite with her instantly in order to alleviate some human suffering; nevertheless, she never gains enough power to retain or expel an incarnate spirit at will, as her purer shamanistic counterpart is able to do. Although the belian initiates her state of possession, she proceeds in a totally "un-shamanic" way to hand over the control to her incarnating spirits. Despite this, only during specific moments in the ritual progression can she be said to be totally usurped by her spirit and to be visibly someone else or moving in some other form of existence. One epithet that can surely be used without any hesitation is "priest". The belian are "priestly practitioners" in as much as they are the official bearers of a religious office and spiritual guardians to their ritual dependants — both of which public functions they are under strong social and moral pressure to perform. Not least, all major belian have the charge of several anak nimok, or ritual dependants. This is reason enough for them to feel compelled to carry out their duties continuously, or with only the shortest of interruptions. Belian and anak nimok are bound to each other by mutual obligation. The anak nimok accept the food taboos, promising to hand over, or send, monthly tebuu, and once a year some of their newly harvested rice, to their belian for the ritual of "freeing" these foods.8 The belian, even in their more "charismatic" function as spirit mediums, have always been called upon to satisfy their fellow humans' quest for an intelligible explanation of those empirical phenomena which otherwise elude comprehension. In the more clearly "institutionalized" aspects of their priesthood they are custodians of a wealth of firmly established ritual proceedings, which constitute the "socialized" forms of man's primeval attempts to "coerce" the unseen (Radin, 1957:7).9</page><page sequence="3">As Night Falls: A Dusun Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 3 The authors have no hesitation, either, in applying the term "religion" to the whole cultural complex under discussion. As the discussion in Section 2 may well reveal, we are consciously moved to capture the essence of Dusun transcendental belief as one set of responses to the eternal dilemmas posed by human mortality, suffering and unpredictable or inexplicable natural events.10 Whether we are motivated by any supplementary, and less visible, agenda — that of "the twentieth century relativist combating Western ethnocentrism", for instance (Atkinson, 1987:172); or, more relevant to the case, one that is informed by a readier empathy with the Dusun complex than its challenger, Islam, has managed to evoke — must be left to the reader to decide. In any event, the Dusun case can be linked to the theme of decline or adaptation of religions elsewhere in the archipelago, which has attracted some sociological interest. In this light, no apology is needed for entering a brief, but comparative, observation on the position of Dusun religion in the context of "nation-building" and "Islamization" in a non-democratic Malay Sultanate, taking off from the concept of "marginality" in two of its applications. There is a paradox about the "marginality" of certain religions of Indonesia, understood in the sense of "geographically isolated and politically inferior". An analyst is, of course, well-advised to beware of the pitfalls of a purely "cultural" approach to the interpretation of religion, à la Geertz, by taking reasonable account of the socio political context in which religious systems evolve, even in remote areas (Atkinson, 1987:186). And it does appear that the religion of not only the Wana of Central Sulawesi (Atkinson, 1987) but the Meratus of South Kalimantan (Tsing, 1987) and the Ngaju of Central Kalimantan (Weinstock, 1981; Schiller, 1986) has been undergoing significant reformulation (if it is not, rather, a self-conscious formulation of "religion" de novo) under the impact of the nation-defining criteria of Indonesia's civil religion. Most saliently, these marginal ethnic groups have found themselves constrained to assert an equality of dignity with dominant groups, and protest their loyalty to the Indonesian state, by claiming to be monotheists (a requirement of the state philosophy, Pancasila).11 In the case of the Meratus, however, it would seem that the major imperative for claiming monotheism arises directly from the cultural pretensions and politico-economic ambitions of the neighbouring Muslim Banjar — a context in which a notable adat-leader has invoked central recognition by conjuring a glorious tribal past under the protection of Majapahit — rather more than religious affinity. This seems appropriate enough for the reformulation of religions should not be interpreted in a narrowly religious framework, but rather in terms of "the ways in which people actively engage their marginality by protesting, reinterpreting, and embellishing their exclusion" (Tsing, 1993:5). But in particular, we would add that the Meratus' case is not in logical disjunction with the others, considering that Indonesia's basically pluralistic civil religion was itself formulated in order to extend reassurance to non Muslim Indonesians, at a time when Islamic movements were prepared to take up arms to impose an Islamic identity on the Indonesian state and embryonic nation. Nor was this purely a matter of Bung 'Karno recognizing the diversity of cultures in the Outer Islands (it was even in the Outer Islands that Islam was able to mount its most effective military challenge). Pluralism is most relevant and politically essential in Java itself, the theatre of a still unresolved historic tension between Islam and more ancient, Hinduistic allegiances (Jay, 1963). Well might ethnic minorities in Kalimantan look to a Javanese centre for reassurance!12</page><page sequence="4">4 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaiv So the paradox that was foreshadowed above can be concretized by saying that because of the huge proportions of Indonesia, geographically and population wise, which gave rise to the perception that cultural pluralism was a sine qua non of successful nation-building, the reformulation of religions, though defensive and from some points of view''a "betrayal", does not necessarily trace a route to annihilation. No such option of dignified self-preservation is on offer to indigenous minority religions in the enclave state of Brunei, the nearest approximation to an Islamic polity in Southeast Asia. Nor, indeed, is another kind of survival-in-marginal-guise available: that of a cult on the theological, unorthodox periphery of Islam itself. This involves the second definition of "marginality" that may have some heuristic utility in the Brunei-Dusun context. Among the several exciting dimensions of I.M. Lewis's work is its exploration of the role of possession cults on frontiers of Islam in Africa, as in situations where conversion accompanies transition from an agricultural domestic economy to trading. Not only is there a general embourgeoisement of life-style, but Islam specifically prescribes a house-bound role for women, which, being experienced as a kind of marginalization of their sex within the group, in turn gives rise to cults, presided over by an unorthodox, shamanistic female hierarchy — a parallel and competitive counterpoint to the official, male dominated Islamic establishment (Lewis, 1996:43-74, 122-54). Still, in relation to Brunei, the lack of parallels with these African phenomena is the only point that can be made, and can be quickly made. A primary target of contemporary Islamic revival in the Malay world is pre Islamic survival within its midst. This means, most characteristically, the healing seances known as main peteri ("play of the princess") in Kelantan (Lewis, 1996:135), or magical phenomena, such as the main bubu ("dancing fish-trap") of Brunei. Such remnants of pre-Islamic religion are mocked from Brunei pulpits as examples of "intoxicated, staggering, behaviour" unbefitting of a modern, civilized, let alone God-fearing people. The term for such behaviour in the Brunei-Malay dialect is bertemarok, whose cognate in the language of the Bisaya-Dusun, temarok, denotes their central religious ritual. It may not be quite fortuitous that Dusuns never call the ritual temarok when speaking Malay, yet their Malay term, berhairtu, seems in no less degree to legitimize the Islamic judgement on the ritual as "pagan and uncivilized", for it can be glossed over pretty well as "playing ghosts". It seems unthinkable, ideologically, that temarok and the presiding belian could find a place within the fold of Bruneian Islam — least of all in terms of a network of peripheral yet rival centres of primordial magical power. Nevertheless, as Islam has been known to make ideological compromises at various times and places, let us examine the inhibiting factors more closely. The African examples examined by Lewis typically involve ancient kingdoms and social systems undergoing penetration by Islam, with the conversion of the elites. Since belian are not the wives of leading members of the dominant group but ordinary members of a peasant minority, individual conversion to Islam is a form of renunciation of Dusun, in favour of a broadly "Malay" identity; and since the terms in which this ethnic boundary can be crossed are laid down by a secure and well-funded Islamic establishment of the majority group, it is precisely and only on the basis of renunciation of the old religion — even attendance at its rituals — that accession to Malay identity by any Dusun, belian or lay-person, is countenanced. In</page><page sequence="5">As Night Falls: A Dusun Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 5 a situation of accelerating conversions, the survival of Dusun shamanism, even as a subterranean cult, thus seems improbable in the extreme: actually less probable than comparable survivals among the peasant Kedayans, who, being already Muslim, cannot be forced to reject elements of ancient culture as a condition of recognition as Malays. Dusuns know the rule and accept it as natural: the less educated converts (and the unconverted elderly) take it for granted that a change of ethnicity entails a transfer of allegiance to a new divine patron (the God of the Malays) and acceptance of the associated system of taboos and punishments. The more "up-to-date" converts, whether converting out of conviction or for marriage, will have internalized at least a part of the modern Islamic discourse which presents Islam as a religion of modernity and civilization, and of course, also as a religion which guards its adherents against the evils of cosmopolitan, non-Muslim modernity in the present day world. Apart from a very few young Dusuns who insist that their ancestors laid claim to a unitary, supreme God, Ratala, there is a pervasive acceptance of the Muslim view that what Dusuns believe is indeed merely kepercayaan ("belief"), in contrast to Muslim belief, which has the quality of ugama ("religion").13 This is in striking contrast to the examples from Indonesian Kalimantan, where the term "religion", with selective Muslim correlates, is co-opted and applied by indigenous groups to their own transcendental beliefs in a spirit of proactive self-defence. From another point of view, the belian role is so priestly and central that it could hardly slip into a peripheral or subterranean function without a fatal loss of meaning. Again with contrasting reference to the examples from conservative African societies, converted Dusun women in Brunei will not be confined to the household, with consequent loss of subjective status and a need to compensate for this through any kind of mystical activity; on the contrary, they will mainly see a great deal of economic activity, enjoying the status of wage-earners and opportunities of mobility outside the home.14 And if they convert young, before they have been recruited as belian, they will neither have a concept of the "cultural asset" which is being lost to the community through the shrinking of the pool of potential recruits, nor a sense of deprivation in being forced to give up beliefs which they had never assimilated anyway. Nor will they have the memories which might notionally provide a basis for a "nativist" revival among Malay-speaking Dusun descendants a generation hence. Let us note, lastly, that all individual strategies are played out in the limited physical space of a micro-state, in which an Islamic government is eager, and above all equipped, to set cultural agendas, and exert literally daily pressure on any micro minority to accept them. The argument can even be made that the Brunei-Malay elite eschewed opportunities for re-expansion of Brunei's borders in the era of decolonization in order to sustain favourable numerical relationships vis-à-vis non Muslim minorities, especially the Ibans (Kershaw, R. 1998). The Dusun Universe, Priesthood and Religious Practices The temarok rituals of Dusun religion15 offer a particular insight into how the Dusuns — to be precise, the Dusuns of the past and the still living older members of the community today — perceived and still perceive the world around them, the universe, themselves, and the host of benevolent and malevolent known spirits.</page><page sequence="6">6 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw Moreover, they constitute rare practices in the sense that unlike most other customary practices of the present-day Dusuns, for instance weddings, they remain relatively little influenced by modernization and ideological borrowings. Adherence to them either persists or is dropped Completely. Dusun religious thought is fundamentally socio-centred. The cosmos as an arena where man and spirits, both benign and malign, coexist and intermingle, is reflected on the ritual stage of the temarok, where similarly man and spirits meet and avow their adherence to largely the same moral codes. To learn to understand these universal laws shared by all, as well as special rights claimed by the malign spirits (isi), had been the task of the ancient Dusuns, whose rulings are a legacy to the present generations.16 In the course of centuries, experience had taught the Dusuns that despite the common set of rules, not only they, but also the community of malevolent spirits, fail to conform to these directives at times; that the interests of either party often diverge substantially from those of the other; and that reciprocal tolerance and respect, the basis for harmonious and peaceful cohabitation, are often lacking. The ancients therefore had to find means to redress the ensuing frictions and bring the offending and offended parties back into line. This they learnt to achieve by appealing to common sense and goodwill when in the presence of the offending human or non-human party, or else by using the appropriate degree of force: "fines" for humans to compensate the spirits, coercive magic for spirits. As both humans and malevolent spirits claim access to, and equal rights over, the world's resources, their equivalence makes it necessary for the former to enter into a formal relationship with the latter. Given the anthropomorphic nature of the spirits, such partnerships are possible. In addition, in situations where these spirits have infringed on human rights and caused undeserved suffering, or when man is the culprit and is duly chastized by the spirits with illness or misfortune for transgressing the norms, the Dusuns have discovered means of relieving the hardship in question. The religious specialists (the beliari) have learnt to mobilize those spiritual powers which have been found to be well disposed, leaning upon them to act as brokers in the attempt to restore the status quo ante and the well-being of the afflicted. These spiritual entities, which have placed themselves at the disposal of the Dusuns, are known as derato.17 Yet, though constituting both a healing and a life enhancing force to all Dusuns, they cannot be approached by the non-initiated. Only those Dusuns specifically chosen by the divine derato themselves may, after formal acceptance of the priestly office and belian-ship, seek and establish contact. Although recruitment is open to both sexes, female belian were already more numerous in the past, and are completely predominant today. Derato, or derato belian (as these spirits are termed, to indicate their exclusive accessibility to the belian), though significantly different in personality and demands from the malevolent spirits (isi) and the spirits of the dead (lamatai),18 nevertheless display certain "anthropomorphic" as well as "zoomorphic" characteristics. Though generally not partaking in earthly pursuits, nor sharing nature's resources with man as the isi do, they present themselves to the belian in recognizable and meaningful forms. For instance, like humans, they delight in visual and aromatic stimuli; like beasts, they appear either as domesticated or in their wild status. But, perhaps more important for the Dusuns, they seem to share some of man's limitations. This impediment, though preventing them from imposing any authority on the spirits threatening man, gives the Dusuns a strong sense of familiarity, which</page><page sequence="7">As Night Falls: A Dttsun Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 7 facilitates their dealings with them. The derato, in keeping with their perceived limitations, are offered neither sacrifices nor worship, but like any human benefactor are given recognition for any help they accord to their human friends. Derato dwell in both the celestial, and the subterranean, sphere, whence they can be called to the intermediate, earthly zone to attend a ritual in progress. Their social organization mirrors the Dusun counterpart, in lacking any notable hierarchical structure. Individually, they too are merely differentiated by functions, behaviour or physical character-traits. Although the majority of derato remain unknown to the lay community, displaying no overtly recognizable character-traits when uniting with their belian, there are other, more distinctive derato, known to all Dusuns. (Whereas the multitude of undifferentiable divine spirits become incarnate in their own belian only on her specific request, the few distinctive derato appear uncalled, but at precise moments in a ritual, and choose the number of belian they wish to unite with.) Not only are the lay Dusuns barred from direct access to the divinities, the derato too are restricted in their contact with humans outside the ceremonial sphere. A derato has only two extra-ritual means of appearing before a Dusun, namely in snake form (lanut derato), seeking to attract attention by adopting a distinctly unreptilian mode of behaviour;19 or by afflicting a candidate chosen for the priesthood with clearly recognizable and attributable symptoms.20 In ritual, each belian (acting here in her most "shamanistic" guise)21 summons her own personal derato, to whom she is permanently bound in a marriage alliance. This supernatural spouse is the first to be called into her presence. And she can at all times be assured of "his" willingness to appear and render her service. Once present, the spirit-husband immediately unites with the belian, infusively. The belian proceeds to evince this union in symbolic gestures. It is thus the proximity of the spirit becomes manifest to all. In the course of a normal ritual in progress, a personal spirit only merges with its host belian for a few minutes at the most, before leaving her. During this short span of time the belian changes from her normal waking condition into a partially "dissociative state" of consciousness,22 where she is neither totally usurped by her spirit, nor totally autonomous. Her consciousness becomes divided: part of it completely absorbed in the presence of her spirit, part of it still engaged with her surroundings. Therefore, while her internal experiences seem to dominate most of her outward functions, she retains sufficient control of self to question her incarnate spirit as a human and on behalf of other humans, and to communicate to the latter any information obtained. Once her spirit has left, she reverts instantly and without any difficulty or pain, back to her original state of alert consciousness. Whether she then summons anew, is a decision left to her.23 Whenever a belian falls comatose — not an uncommon feature in a ritual — it is invariably a sign of her spirit having deserted her in protest. She has to suffer the consequences of someone else neglecting a ceremonial rule, or having become guilty of a more serious disregard for established norms.24 A promise of redress (if possible) and a silver ring usually restores the spirit's favour and, with it, consciousness to the belian. Unsummoned derato only appear in major harvest rituals. They may unite with one belian, more than one, or even all the performing belian, all at the same moment. Here, belian undergo an involuntary possession distinct from any "shamanistic" stereotype. Again by their singly or severally changed expressions and conduct they</page><page sequence="8">8 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw publicly attest to the presence of these spirits, allowing the behavioural characteristics thereof to be transferred to them, their human partners.25 But the Dusun belian is a medium, as well as healer and priest — the priestly aspect being seen most typically in the care of ritual dependants, as has been described. We find-thêâe three functions, each with its social dimension, a more relevant basis of analysis than any three-part typology or progression of relationships with the spirits derived from studies of shamanism. All three functions are exclusively carried out within the ritual framework. Yet belian-ship is not perceived as an official "office" that would open a way from the religious to a social, position, power or wealth. Restricting the function of the belian to the ritual and spiritual realms automatically curtails her effectiveness beyond them. Any respect she commands from the group is in response to her multiple services to the community. Still, these are substantial. In her priestly role she is not only a guardian to any number of ritual dependants, being responsible for their spiritual welfare, but executes the rituals of harvest-thanksgivings and house-cleansings. By affecting cures, too, the belian is exercising a custodianship of her charges' physical well-being. This includes the task of averting imminent calamities threatening an individual or a family.26 But at the same time, both the general priestly functions and the specifically curing function entail the exercise of mediumship. Thus the three-part categorization of curer, medium and priestess, must not be allowed to belie the essential fusion or mutually functional integration of the three, with the indispensable stage for all three activities being the temarok-ntual. The selection to belian-ship either emanates directly from derato, whose choice becomes manifest in generally recognized symptoms in the chosen;27 or occurs when someone promises to be a priestess if certain desired conditions (usually restoration of health) materialize. Where a minor is involved, a relative (usually a parent) makes a promise on her behalf. In the past, such decision was followed by a three-, seven or fourteen-day initiation (ngayat). But where the age and circumstances of the applicant did not allow such lengthy and exacting initiation, the procedure could be concluded in a single nightly ritual (turns). This short form of induction is the only one used currently. Once initiated, the new belian is expected to be gradually taught, by the spirits themselves, the language which will enable her to summon first her own spirit familiar (husband), and subsequently perhaps other, more powerful derato. This language (tuntut derato) she shares with no other belian. On the other hand, there is a common stock of ritual terminology used among all belian (tuntut belian), whose acquisition from her fellows constituted no problem in the past, when rituals were a common feature of long-house life. Whether the newly experienced belian remains an ordinary priestess (belian biasa), or progresses to the position of a leading belian (tetua belian) and powerful curer (pangiau), does not depend on her own resolve and effort, but again on divine selection. Whatever the role assigned to her, the community (certainly in the past, somewhat less so today) expected her to accept it willingly and execute it conscientiously. In turn, the community responds with the necessary support for her undertakings and concern for her personal well-being. The detailed account of the central Dusun ritual which follows may be read — between the lines of the detail — as a memorial to a still living, but terminally threatened social compact between a community and its ritual custodians, which is</page><page sequence="9">As Night Falls: A Dusiin Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 9 predicated in turn on the vitality of the understandings between humans and the world of the spirits. The compact is threatened precisely because these understandings have lost their meaning for many members of the younger generation exposed to modern lifestyles or Islamic doctrine. Even some members of the older generation, as we shall see in Section 4, have begun to suspect a withdrawal of the spirits from effective intercourse with the Dusuns and intervention on their behalf. Temarok An Outline The two most frequent rituals performed in the past were healing ceremonies (temarok bagiau) and the monthly ceremony (temarok bulan) to allow consumption of eggs and bananas by all the charges (dependants) of a belian. The healing session can be attached to the latter, or indeed to any other temarok if necessary. The advent of modem medicine has, however, considerably reduced the calls on ritual specialists to cure. And the monthly temarok has largely given way to a much simplified monthly offering, named ngkadim ("to call"), requiring no ritual set-up nor a belian to perform it.28 The elaborate, annual harvest-temarok, on the other hand, has continued to enjoy a fair amount of popularity — even among the younger Dusuns. The reason for the continued patronage by the young Dusuns must be seen to rest partly on "tribal" consciousness and a search for "identity" (at least, a self-conscious, subjective need for these): in other words, it is the social aspect rather than a metaphysical meaning that attracts them. Equipped with little socialization in the underlying religious concepts, they are generally less willing than the older generation to accept the inherent meaning of the ceremonial paraphernalia and ritual behaviour of the belian, despite all that they signify in terms of a life-line to the ethnic past and living focus of identity. A further factor for the popularity of these harvest rituals is that they are often preceded by a meal, served to large numbers. Therefore, while the argument that little has changed in the execution of a temarok, the relationship between the young audience and the performing specialists has altered. In the past, although there could never be a fusion between the lay audience and the spirits, there was no polarization into participants and non-participants — in short, there was no "audience" per se. Both specialists and non-specialists continuously interacted, with everyone becoming an actor on the ritual stage at some point in the ritual. "Public performance" clearly meant "communal performance". Today the audience have largely become spectators to an increasingly alien phenomenon. The temarok which has always enjoyed great favour among the belian and audience, and is still the one most often requested by the belian or offered to them by the community, is the crocodil e-temarok (temarok buayo). As a harvest -temarok, it is performed in recognition of the value of the original divine gift of rice and to comply with the condition which the celestial donors attached to it, namely that the newly harvested rice should always be offered to them first. The ritual, with all its colour, decorations and fragrance, not only meets these basic requirements, but is also thought to be pleasing to the spirits in the same way as it is to humans. All Dusun villages share the basic structure of the crocodile-temarok, but vary in</page><page sequence="10">10 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw ornaments, ceremonial details and choice of rhythmic patterns. The ritual's main focus is a crocodile shaped out of unmilled rice, the only animal to be accredited with near totemic value. And it appears here, as it has done since the mythical past, both in the shape of a reptile and a handsome (albeit divine and not human) male.29 The temarok lonciyo is by far the most dramatic of all the temarok.30 It not only incorporates the opposites of spirit and human world, male and female, the real and the supernatural, fun .and reverence — as all other harvest-temarok do — but adds the antitheses of life and death; birth and extinction; boldness and cowardice; joy and pain; ecstasy and despair. The belian herself displays much more explicitly in this temarok than in others (indeed uniquely so, apart from the temarok lanut) the intrinsic duality of her ritual role, alternating as it does, often in rapid succession, between her own female identity and the male identity of her spiritual partner. At one moment she is the flirtatious, ostentatiously feminine companion and euphoric bride; at the next, the stereotypically masculine hunter of beasts, even heads. And nowhere else does she delight and entertain both the spirits and her human audience as much as here. The older people among the latter not only respond vocally, but by accepting the underlying symbolism of her behaviour, step in to assist the belian in her unreal, spiritual pursuits as if they were "real". None of the older folk assembled doubts the authenticity of her contradictory feelings and emotions, as displayed in the course of the performance. The crocodile-temarok, as a major harvest ritual, can have its own ritual overture the night before: the temarok papa.31 The main ritual can take place as soon as the harvest is concluded and up until the time when the land needs to be refilled for the next rice crop. Increasingly, school holidays help to determine a date for such a ceremony. For without it, no rice of the field, which produced the rice for the ritual, may be consumed by a Dusun attached to a belian.32 The temarok papa held on the night preceding the main temarok also presupposes that every stage of the harvest, including the "lifting of the central rice-plants" (batanggang tango), has been completed. If the centre ears have been left standing; or if the central rice-plants are lifted at the beginning of a new moon-phase and the major ritual is staged within the same, first half of the moon cycle, no temarok papa is called for. At any rate, both temarok papa (when prescribed) and temarok buayo must be held in the waxing-moon phase, between the first and the fifteenth day. The temarok papa may be combined with a monthly ritual to free the monthly restrictions of eggs and bananas, or with a healing ceremony, as was the case with the temarok papa now to be described. Description of a Temarok Papa Preceding a Temarok Buayo33 Both rituals had been promised by a son for his sick belian mother should she regain her health. This being the case, a date was fixed between the sponsor, venue-host (the husband of the patient) and the principal belian and eurer. All relatives and friends were notified of the day chosen for the temarok.34 Unlike the main temarok, to which everyone is welcome, guests at the foregoing temarok papa only come by invitation. Belians, however, are more than welcome to both rituals&gt; even if not explicitly enjoined. The procedure of this particular temarok papa, however, was decisively changed by the presence of a seriously sick child, brought along by its distraught parents, who implored the principal belian for help.</page><page sequence="11">As Night Falls: A Dusun Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 11 During the day family members collected and prepared the necessary ceremonial requisites:35 coconut leaves for seven tiny chickens (tebuu); one coconut, whose gratings will supply oil for the seven rice-fritters (taji), which with tebuu, an egg and bananas will adorn the ritual tray; an areca-palm shoot pusok pinang as the accompaniment to'the ritual spear; and a hand of bananas (of the luti or Win type). After the chickens (three cockerels with elongated necks, four hens with short necks) have been woven, they are filled with husked rice grains (agas) from a previous harvest, and boiled in water. Using a wooden mortar and long wooden pestle, about one handful of husked rice is subsequently pounded into fine flour and shaped into seven little blobs of about 2 cm in diameter and fried in the oil of the said coconut. Only village rice (agas kabun) may be used for both the tebuu and taji.36 The host engages in fashioning the spirit-house (tambyungun) to resemble a small Dusun house, with walls and roof of soft sago-palm strips, held in place by tiny wooden pins. No glue may be employed for its construction. The eaves and ridges of the roof are beautifully carved, and decorated with patterns and motifs, using the red juice of chewed betel-nuts. The Dusuns know of no reason for the existence of this house other than it having always been one of the requisite paraphernalia in a temarok papa and temarok makan parai, for which rice-wine (burak) has to be brewed37 and the sky (kemajang) over the ritual centre bedecked. 2000h The principal belian arrives. The remaining belians intending to officiate on this occasion — five adults and two children — are either members of the family or related, and already present; and are either engaged in some preparations for the major ritual next day or having their meal. The main room, where the ritual will be staged, is clearly recognizable as having hosted other such occasions, by the eleven gongs slung or hung in their permanent positions along the wall.38 In the middle of the room hangs the equally permanent bamboo frame (kemajang), some feet below the roof and at a height of about two-and-a-half metres above the ground. Several long and still folded strips of coloured material were made to rest on top of the "sky". 2100hMats made from pandan grass are rolled out beneath the bamboo frame, and the ceremonial spear (bangkau usus), with the point of the blade set in a section of fibrous coconut shell, positioned on them. This spear is distinguished from a hunting spear by its smaller blade. The coconut shell is made to rest on the floor, while the shaft is attached to the bamboo frame by a string. Some 20-30 cm of the white ceremonial cloth (rarai) is passed through the fork formed between spear and string, the remaining 70-80 cm loosely draped around the spear shaft. To a person facing the long end of the rarai, the string must be stretching upward to his left. To ensure that the rarai always falls in the same direction, a knot, containing a pea-sized piece of incense (kemayan) has been tied in one of its corners. This knotted corner always serves as the tip of the longer end, hanging in proximity to the floor. The opened areca-palm shoot (pusok pinang) is then hooked onto the high end of the spear shaft,39 as is the spirit-house. Finally long pieces of textile are draped over the bamboo frame, but left unfolded. A burning kerosene lamp is hung from a hook in the roof.</page><page sequence="12">22 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw 2130h Half of a hollowed-out coconut shell (minus the outer fibre) is filled with charcoal embers and burning incense (kemayan), and is brought in and placed close to the spear.40 Several brass pedestal-trays or plates, each holding tebuu, taji and an accompanying egg (with its top end cracked and a tiny bit of shell removed)41 — the offerings of merhbers of the host family — are added along with six belian-trays (banta belian).42 All trays are grouped around the spear. The little pedestal-trays of the belian carry the two obligatory pieces of red and white cotton material, folded neatly.43 Resting on them is a bundle of three cigarettes of village tobacco, rolled in nipah leaf and fastened together with a silver ring (bind),*4 and the skapor (a sireh leaf, raun daing) fashioned into a set of three little pockets, which in turn are filled with pieces of betel-nut (pinang) and a little lime-paste (kapor). Those belians who brought along their own tebuu-set have arranged the items on top of their banta. All window-shutters are pulled tight and the door closed, to forestall any belian jumping out in pursuit of some encounter, pleasant or unpleasant. The mirror on the wardrobe is covered, so that the belians will not be frightened by their own reflections in the glass, and the resident cat locked away in a cage, to prevent it from straying into the room in mid-ritual and causing the belians to "fall" in fright. 2140h The musicians are called to their instruments to play the gandang tebuu,45 signalling basically the presence of tebuu in the ritual arena, but secondly the conclusion of all preparations. After their short performance the musicians once more disband. 2230h The principal belian, the hostess, the four mature relatives and two children assemble at the ritual centre, the adults wearing embroidered blouses over batik skirts, the two child-belian long tunics and matching skirts.46 Each belian carries a bundle containing the red and white headband (asik), the narrow sash (selampai), the handkerchief (perasa), and the fan (kiob) of their office. They sit down in a circle around the spear, and start to move and twist their bundles several times over the incense, allowing all sides to be touched by the smoke before unrolling them.47 They don their sashes, press the headband well onto their heads, clasp the handkerchief with their left hands and finally open their fans. The mature belian are now ready to begin the process of dissociation and to call into presence (ngadim) their very own spirit husbands. With eyes closed and face hidden behind the fan, they implore the spirit in a suspended monotone to emerge and unite with them. The burning incense will facilitate this descent. The moment of entry (ngkuku "to mount") by derate is marked by a shivering or trembling of their entire upper torso. As soon as each individual unification is complete, each belian stands up, but continues in her monotone address for a little while longer. The children imitate the process as much as possible, but their eyes remain open and their voices silent. The musicians have reassembled at their instruments. Soon after the first callings by the belian, the cylindrical drum (dombak) begins to beat the first rhythm, the gandang lambat.48 Individually at first, then as a group, the belians respond by moving anti-clockwise round the central ritual arrangement, the experienced ones leading the two novices. The initial rhythm being so slow, the dance movements at this stage have more the nature of a dreamy, slightly swaying, processional perambulation. Each mature belian dances with her eyes closed, and may be heard</page><page sequence="13">/Is Night Falls: A Dusiin Harvest Ritual in Brunei * 13 communicating with the now residing spirit through her singing. After several, and not less than three, complete perambulations, the spirits withdraw and the belians return to their recent standing position.49 When all belians are once again stationary, the musicians move on to the second, still ambulatory rhythm, the aleo gandang.50 The experienced belian recommence their summoning of derate, and soon afterwards resume their perambulations around the spear. This rhythm is followed by the livelier gandang parang and gandang imang-imang. After the gandang lambat, the cymbals of the ntangan started sounding. The dragging of the feet by the belians during the initial rhythm continued during the aleo gandang, merely a degree faster. The gandang parang and gandang imang-imang, in contrast, normally entice the belian to very gracious dance movements. On this occasion, however, the presence of the sick child caused the belians to remain unusually subdued, as if having been robbed of both vigour and joy. The musicians, who normally accompany the cadre of belians, and pause after these have all regained their individual standing positions and before striking up a new rhythm, had to devote their attention and their service entirely to the principal belian. 2250h The seven belians quietly terminate their performance, hardly noticed by anybody. Seated on the floor, they each kiss their fan once more, fold it together, tap their shoulders and knees several times with it, and remove their headbands and sashes, before tying them with the handkerchief and fan back into a bundle, which they finally deposit close to the ritual spear. They stand up and move away. The principal belian meanwhile had regularly detached herself from the group in order to attend to the sick child bedded down in one corner of the room. Shortly into the fourth rhythm, she had ceased to rejoin the rest in their perambulations, devoting her entire time to the child, by first searching, then capturing and returning the abducted soul to it. The expression on her face and the tone of her voice constantly reflect the intense anguish and pain of the child, which she herself seems to feel. From time to time she breaks down, shivering and trembling. More than once she shuffles along the ground on her bottom or knees. 2310h Having been questioned by the relatives of the child about the knowledge she had gained about the cause of the illness and the compensation requested, the principal belian terminates her performance. The musicians, who had been unable to either pause or change their rhythm during this entire endeavour, are at last able to halt and leave their instruments.51 Description of the Temarok Buayo Part of the day is taken up with preparing the meal that will be offered to the guests arriving early.52 During the afternoon, the seven tebuu, woven the day before, are filled with newly harvested and husked rice-grains and again boiled in water. Using the small wooden mortar and long wooden pestle, about two handfuls of new, husked rice are subsequently pounded into coarse flour, which is mixed with sufficient water to shape into small round cakes of 1-2 cm in diameter and sun-dried, for use on the crocodile. One other handful of new, milled rice is pounded, shaped and fried into seven tiny rice-fritters (taji) as on the previous day.</page><page sequence="14">14 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw m progress, with spectators.

In the centre of the kitchen, mats have already been rolled out on the floor, and stacks of plates and glasses piled up on them in anticipation of the early guests, to whom food will be served. For the rest there will be tea or coffee, biscuits and cakes. The main room, and scene of the coming ritual, is still rather bare. The pieces of textiles, already draped over the bamboo frame for the temarok papa, but left unfolded, are now opened up over the entire bamboo frame (kemajang), dominating the middle of the room. Likewise left in position from the previous night are the rolled-out mats beneath the sky, and the ceremonial spear (bangkau usus) with the white ceremonial cloth (rarai) draped around it. The opened areca-palm shoot (pusok pinang) on the high end of the spear shaft is also from the previous night, as is the spirit-house (tambyungun). Close by, the rays emitted by the already lighted kerosene lamp provide a pleasing source of light. One brass pedestal-tray heaped with new milled rice (a dulang agas) and decorated with multi-coloured flags, and a small plate containing yellow rice,53 are the only objects standing next to the spear. But not far from the centre stands a bladeless spear shaft draped with another cloth (rarai) and with an areca-palm shoot attached to it.54 Beside this, heaped onto mats, lie five gantang55 of new, unmilled padi (parai). 1830h Burning incense (kemayan) is brought in and placed close to the spear. All window-shutters are pulled tight and the door closed, as on the previous evening, and the mirror on the wardrobe is covered. 1855h The principal belian, the hostess and two relatives, all dressed in batik sarongs and blouses, assemble at the ritual centre, sit down in a circle around the spear, pick up their own bundles — containing the red and white headband (asik), the narrow sash (selampai), the handkerchief (perasa), and the fan (kiob) and as on the previous night move and twist them several times over the incense, unroll them, and don their sashes and headbands, before finally opening their fans. With eyes closed and face hidden behind the fan, they again beg their familiar spirits to appear and unite with them. And as on the night before, the moment of entry causes each belian to shiver or tremble. Each one then stands up, still addressing her spirit in her monotone voice. The first callings of derato by the belians have also summoned the musicians to their instruments. Led by the cylindrical drum (dombak), they sound off with an introductory rhythm.56 1900hThe four belians, with their eyes closed, start their lively anti-clockwise perambulations, first encircling the spear, then the heaped padi. After several rounds, the principal belian picks up the dish of yellow rice and hands her three companions some of the grains, which they scatter first over the padi, then over the rice-tray, musicians and anyone present, before the principal belian leaves the dish resting on the padi. 1914h The four belians having returned to their initial standing positions, pause for a moment and sit down. Each belian kisses her fan once more, folds it together, taps her shoulder and knees several times with the folded fan, and removes her headband</page><page sequence="16">16 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw and sash, before tying them with the handkerchief and fan back into a bundle, which she then deposits close to the ritual spear. The musicians, too, have ceased to beat their instruments, and together with the belians rejoin the non-performing party of the gathered company. 2130h The host, hostess and a belian kinswoman57 proceed to shape the padi. The emerging, larger-than-life crocodile is given bulging eyes (two eggs), feet of five claws (five small bananas, punti lilin or punti luti), and an arched back and tail, with little, round rice-cakes and pieces of coconut flesh shaped into half-moons to represent the scales (sisi).58 The spine and bones on body and legs are adumbrated by five long, pleated, concertina-like tresses (lipan) of coconut leaves (raun piasau)-, the heart (bua adan) by a fully-grown, complete coconut, placed at its right flank between the fore and rear leg; and the stomach (ntuko) by a miniature basket, woven from coconut leaves and filled with unhusked new rice, and pressed into the animal's body. The tray, piled with new, dehusked rice, and a glass half-filled with rice-wine (burak), are placed at its left flank. A dozen or so long, pleated lances (bangkau, also of coconut leaves), and four swords of soft wood, are deposited at the tail end. Owing to the narrow shape of the room, this animal could not be oriented towards the setting sun (mato adau matai: "dying sun"), the head looking west, as a symbol of its imminent death, but had to face north. The little pedestal-tray of the principal belian (banta belian), carrying the two pieces of red and white cotton material, a bundle of three cigarettes fastened together with a silver ring (buid), and the skapor, is set close to the head of the beast. Finally two candles are lodged in the animal's back, and lit.59 2145h Brass pedestal-trays or plates, each holding tebuu, taji and an accompanying cracked egg; several trays of dehusked rice with tebuu, taji, egg and bananas; as well as further belian-trays, are brought in and grouped around the spear. A little cushion made of coconut leaves, also filled with dehusked rice but left uncooked (ketupat), is suspended from the sky. Its purpose is that when hit by a performing belian as she passes it, or rocked by members of the audience, it should shed some of its content onto the floor. The sound of the falling grains will startle the nearby belian and rouse them to amusing jumps or mild verbal tirades. Butterflies with colourful paper wings and bodies made of rolled nipah leaves are distributed around the belian-trays. An areca-palm flower (mayang pinang), still in its sheath, a bottle of rice wine, a stack of glasses, some bundles of candles and boxes of matches, are added to complete the ceremonial requisites. 2150h The musicians are recalled to their instruments to play the gandang tebuu, after which they once more disband. 2220h The belians, having donned their finery — embroidered blouses over batik skirts for the now eight, mature belians, long tunics and matching skirts for the two child-belians, the traditional type of black velvet tunic over a batik skirt for the elderly hostess60— are assembling, seated in a circle around the spear. They pass their bundles of headband, sash, fan and handkerchief over the rekindled incense, and unfold and arrange them. The musicians return to their instruments.</page><page sequence="17">/4s Night Falls: A Dusun Harvest Ritual in Brunei »17 2222h The first rhythm, the gandang lambat is sounded. All 10 belians are still seated, fanning themselves or calling their spirits from behind their opened fans. Once imbued with their respective spirits, the belians get up and move anti-clockwise round the central arrangement. After several complete perambulations, the belians return to their recent standing position, and the musicians move on to the second rhythm, the aleo gandang. The mature belians once again summon derato, and soon afterwards recommence their dance, first circling the spear as before, then moving over to, and then around, the crocodile, continuously fanning it. 2243h The tray of the principal belian, having been pushed towards the head of the animal, is first fanned by its owner, the hostess and two relatives, then picked up by the sponsor of the temarok and carried twice (anti-clockwise) around the lifeless animal, to be then put down at its south-facing tail-end. This is intended as an inducement for the principal belian to begin her search for the life-giving soul. The principal belian, however, having picked up a trail, advances eastwards in the direction of the musicians. Recognizing this, a non-performing belian quickly takes the priestly tray and carries it past the musicians to the most easterly corner and sets it on the ground there. The principal belian, with her three assistants closely behind, follows. As she approaches the discovered soul, she begins to shiver. Having spread her handkerchief over her left-hand palm and fingers, she soon bends low, and with her open fan carefully nudges the soul onto the handkerchief. The three assistants, with fans open, stand ready to recapture the soul should it attempt to escape, and to assist its safe passage into the handkerchief. The principal belian then grasps the essence tightly in her clenched hand, kisses the clasped bundle ecstatically and invites the hostess to do likewise. The expressions of both women clearly betray joy and delight. All four then return to the lifeless crocodile, preceded by the non performing belians with the priestly tray, which she once more deposits at the beast's right flank. The four belians circle the animal twice, before the principal belian, followed by the others, inclines over its upper part and releases the soul, from the bunched handkerchief, upon its head. After shaking out the handkerchief a second time, in a downward movement, she takes the glass of rice-wine tendered to her and first pours some bnrak over the head, then thrice blows a gulp of incense onto it. Finally all four belians pick a handful of dehusked rice from the rice-tray "belonging to the animal", and scatter it over the entire animal body to infuse it with vigour and vitality. Their cries, their frightened behaviour, and obvious reluctance from this point on to approach the crocodile, convey to everyone present that the spiritual beast has stirred. Repeatedly they poke their folded fans in its direction, but quickly withdraw. When any one of them occasionally plucks up sufficient courage to make physical contact with the animal, she instantly flees the scene in manifest horror, sometimes recounting to other belians the ferocity with which the beast snaps, sometimes nursing a bitten heel. The four lesser, and two child, belians are withdrawing at this point from active participation. 2315h The four wooden swords are gradually handed to the four principal belians, who rarely go beyond pointing at the heart (the coconut on the animal's side) before they retreat in terror. One of them is striving to escape the animal's fury by</page><page sequence="18">18 » Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw attempting to climb one of the vertical posts within the room, causing great mirth among the audience.61 Amidst repeated urgings from the guests and host-family the belians at last accept the woven lances and, in thrusting them at the crocodile, open the first wounds. What will ncdv follow is an intermittent frenzy of tumultuous and frantic stabbing by the belians, members of the host-family and guests alike, the latter being led into action by the belians themselves. The climax of this attack will come just before dawn and may be seen as a close counterpart if not replication of the human sacrifice practised by the Dusuns until late into the last century.62 Meanwhile, on the musical side, the first four orchestral rhythms have by now run their course. The two already mentioned were succeeded by the livelier gandang parang and gandang imang-imang, inducing the belian to highly pleasing dance steps and movements. The harmonious and totally unified corps of dancers during the first two rhythms was disbanded in favour of individual virtuosity, which will be even more fostered by advanced rhythms to come. 2335h The principal belian requests a basket, slings it onto her back and amidst the other belians, continues in her expressive dance, calling audibly. 2345h The principal belian moves to one side, and with her closed fern starts forcibly clubbing an indiscernible object to the ground, before scooping the invisible mass into her basket. She replaces the basket on her back and returns to the centre and the rest of the belians, who are all seated. 2355h The principal belian, having taken off her basket, also sits down, bends over the incense, takes a mouthful of the vapour and blows it into the basket. She repeats the process twice, fans the basket a little while, then abandons it.63 (Every pause in the action of this belian is registered by a break in the music.) 0003h The belian and musicians are once more performing. The principal belian picks up the areca-palm flower, opens the sheath, lifts out the spray and shakes it so vigorously that its seeds scatter widely. She approaches the hostess from behind and taps her back, posterior and legs with it. After she has done the same to her two other assistants, she hands the now almost exhausted flower-spray to them. Holding it between them, they continue to dance around the centre. 0020h The principal belian requests a glass for herself and the other belians, and orders the pouring of biirak.M After the belians have drunk, they offer their glasses to the sponsor, then to all the members of the host family, the musicians, and selected guests.65 The resultant, mild intoxication among the spirits present causes some incoherence of speech and gestures among the belians. To this, not a little wildness is added when, following the tasting of burak, derato misok sidn (the lamp extinguishing derato) comes to take possession of all performing belians, as manifested in their uncontrollable urge to remove all light from the room. To pre-empt this, as well as injury or a possible fire, all but one pressure-lamp has been removed well in advance of the arrival of derato misok sulu, and the remaining one protected by a wicker basket. Furthermore, every member of the family stands ready with a burning</page><page sequence="19">As Night Falls: A Dusun Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 19 candle, and a lighter or matches, in order to relight any candle on the trays that had fallen prey to the onslaught, and thus avert further confusion and disarray when derato ngodong libun (the cloth-pulling-off derato) appears, to infuse the leading belian and provoke her to pull the pieces of material down from the sky.66 A further reason for averting total darkness is that the spirit which will possess the principal belian soon after (and in this case, one assistant) is the derato mondou (the great cat derato), which must be thwarted in its attempts to demonstrate its even wilder and more terrifying nature. (In a still illuminated room it is restricted to tearing at the old mats which were specially laid in its way.) In this spirit's presence, the principal belian goes on her knees and in cat-like fashion crawls and claws. Once the mats are torn, derato mondou, satisfied, leaves the belian, who instantly gets up and returns to her normal dance movements. After a short interlude, during which the seated, principal belian smokes a butterfly and lets it hover and flutter over the paper-flowers decorating the central offertory trays, all belians tap their shoulders and knees repeatedly with their fans, take off their headbands and sashes, rebundle them, and leave them next to the spear ready for the following and final session. Most of the onlookers depart for home. The break which now ensues, lasting almost until dawn, allows the belians to catch up with some sleep. 0415hThe drum resumes, the four belians reassemble. They put on their ritual garments, call their spirits, rise, advance, and immediately pick up two of the wooden swords. They then circle the mutilated animal in pairs for a while, before putting the swords back at the tail-end of the animal. From then onwards, they pay little attention to the wounded beast, and their posture is no longer provocative. 0440h The moment arrives at which, almost "more in sorrow than in anger", the final wound is to be inflicted. The principal belian calls on the sponsor to participate in severing the head from the body, cleaving the body in two, and finally chopping off the tail, each time with a single stroke, with the belian and the sponsor grasping the handle of a single sword together. The knotted spine and string of leg bones (lipan) are then bundled into a ball, raised upon the tip of the sword, and paraded around three times to the eerie pulsations of kitku narom.67 As in days of old, when after the death of an eminent family member a skull wrapped in grasses was taken up and danced around the house of the deceased to mark the end of an extended period of mourning,66 so here also, the turning away from death towards new life is celebrated with a symbolic skull. 0450h The bundle of grass having been deposited on the inert form of the crocodile, the principal belian gives the order to the family to reshape the animal — this time with its head to the east, towards the rising sun, and "life".69 0505h Music and action resume. The soul is sought as in the first session, and implanted in the new animal likewise. However, by the elated exclamations and cries of excitement of the principal belian everyone is made aware that what has awakened is no longer the wild beast of earlier, but derato in the form of a handsome male.70 The priestess woos this apparition in an ecstatic dance.</page><page sequence="20">20 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw 0523h In response to an inner command, at the approach of dawn, the principal belian suddenly terminates her state of bliss and abruptly lifts the end of the mat, close to the head of the animal, causing the whole form to collapse upon itself. The soul is perceived now to flee the ruined body and escape through the door or window, already left open in-anticipation. Yet the belian, driven by a wild longing for what was, but a moment since, attempts to follow the fleeing soul, despite the reversion to animal identity and its clear intent to reach the pool or ditch that the belian herself had chosen for it from the start.71 The belian mimics this metamorphosis from man to beast, by going on her knees and creeping on all fours towards the opening through which the animal-soul has just escaped, forcefully attempting to push her way through. Only a barrier of several strong men can block her in this resolve. To persuade her that the separation is irrevocable, the sponsor throws the heart of the animal (the coconut) out of the same opening, while another person takes her personal tray and holds it above her head, to remind her of her enduring priestly duties. 0526h In tears, the principal belian allows herself to be guided back to the centre, to the spear and the three assistants, where she soon regains her calm, and without pain crosses the threshold from ritual, back into everyday existence. 0540h After more perambulations, in measured steps to the strains of the farewell bidding kap-adau (day-break rhythm),72 the four belians pause and sit down, preparing to terminate their performance. They once more tap their shoulders and knees, alternately, several times with the folded fan, before tying it with the headband into the sash and storing it away on or near their personal trays until morning. 0555h The musicians bang out a ragged "finale", much the same as the gandang tebuu. Minutes later, as day breaks, the hostess takes a morsel of tebuu, taji, egg and banana from one of the trays, and rolls it into a ball. Standing at the kitchen door, she throws the ball to the winds, imploring derato once more to accept the offering. Only then can the offered food be consumed by humans.73 Not everybody still present at dawn leaves for home immediately on conclusion of the temarok. The men settle down to drinking,74 the women for further chatting or a game of cards. Members of the household clear away the ritual objects75 and present the principal belian with the entire amount of the rice used to construct the crocodile. Conclusion For some thoughtful older Dusuns, there are unmistakable signs of the weakening and withdrawal of the spirits, almost as if they were following the example of the creator deity, mpuan inan ("owner of the physical body"),76 who became inaccessible to the Dusuns far back in the mythical past. Certain belians themselves are deeply depressed by the evidence that some of their number who converted to Islam, without going through the statutory procedures for exemption from the office, seemed to incur no divine punishment in the form of the once ineluctable blindness</page><page sequence="21">As Night Falls: A Dusun Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 21 or other crushing afflictions. A male Dusun who became a minor mosque official without renouncing his status as a dependant of a belian, was likewise protected by his newly adopted deity from the wrath of the old. And it is generally believed that if a committed Muslim were to sit in on a temarok77 then derato will not be forthcoming when called. These problems are the structural equivalent, in the spiritual realm, of the increasing political ascendancy of the Brunei Muslim state. The problems seem insoluble and are scarcely explicable in terms of traditional belief. Meanwhile, although the older generation do not doubt that their beliefs are "correct", correctness is not thought to transcend their own ethnic group, increasingly not even their own generation. Although they never before needed to compare Dusun religion in a conceptual way with Islam, they have been forced by the behaviour of the younger generation to at least admit that a choice could be made. Dusuns of the older generation, like the younger, have begun to repeat the official view that places their beliefs — as mere "beliefs" — in a category of distinctly "lesser" excellence. What the older Dusuns are ill-equipped to conceptualize is the persuasiveness of a proselytizing faith that can simultaneously claim universality, the prestige of a literate tradition, and access to a "meaning" for mankind, for some of their children today. There are few young educated Dusuns who will dare to claim that their ancestral religion was perhaps equally if not more successful, of old, in providing answers to the "dilemmas and mysteries of life" than its "Great" counterparts contrived to do, and might with some adaptation even be suited to that role in the future. As the younger generation begin to be able to formulate such comparisons, they tend to do so in terms which imply a more positive evaluation of Islam or Christianity, taking inborn human sinfulness and the need for intercession as givens.78 Socially, conversion holds out a prospect (though usually frustrated in experience) of admission to a no longer completely exclusive, dominant ethnic group: a modified escape from the inferior, rural status which the basic stratification system of the same dominant group imposes on the minorities.79 Quite often, for poor families, conversion offers a temporary boost in welfare, by way of the generous inducements offered by the Missionary Section of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The Brunei Sultanate is not only an avid promoter of economic change and "nation-building", but sees religious propagation as a significant means towards the second goal. (Or, to conceptualize the relationship from a different angle, Dusun religion suffers the peculiar liability — in contrast to Islam among the Malays — of the lack of a supportive state authority to reassure or galvanize waverers, indeed quite the opposite!) It must be stressed that in its currently conservative form, from a political point of view, Brunei Islam is calculated essentially to deliver legitimation of the neo-traditional structure of power. Its effectiveness would be limited, therefore, by the presence of non-believers in significant concentrations. It follows that a minority upholding its own religious tradition, with a strong transcendental dimension, will find itself very much an obstacle to Brunei in its nation-building plans. The Sultanate takes the matter far more seriously than at the time of the Nationality Enactment, over 35 years ago, despite the now powerful trend of assimilation brought about by economic change (including government employment) and education. Indeed, the government schools have been made the primary arena in which minority groups are impressed with their cultural inferiority as so-called "free-thinkers".80</page><page sequence="22">22 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw It is both a "strength", yet another "weakness", also, of Dusun religion that its major rituals are intimately tied up with the rice economy. This is a religion adapted to an ecological niche, besides being difficult to conceive in separation from the ethnic social structure which it nurtures, and which nurtures it, symbiotically. It «teures a sense of collective spiritual well-being, or restores harmony between man and unseen forces when events seem "out of joint", but the scope of these ministrations is confined to the ethnic group and they are significantly predicated on riziculture. Not only can Dusun religion never develop proselytizing pretensions, it can hardly persist even within its host community unless this ecological condition is assured. There are already some Dusuns who plant rice with no economic rationale, but solely in order to sustain the ethnic rituals. Many of these pressures for change can be defined as reflecting the fact that Dusun society is no longer "blessed", as it were, by the relative isolation of earlier times, which guaranteed that no alternative religion would come to its attention except in some dimly understood form. Islam was always perceived as ethnically antagonistic but, simultaneously, as ethnically exclusive (like Dusun religion itself). While there was never a time when Islam — the relevant and realistic example of an alternative religion in the Dusun context — was not associated with the politically sovereign and sometimes economically predatory Malays from the State capital, Dusun perceptions were strongly focused on the penitential rituals and dietary taboos of Islam, such as fasting and abstinence from pork. Muslims were pitied for these hereditary ethnic rigours, not feared as a threat. The Sultanate possessed no great power, and stood usually at arm's length from parochial affairs. However, after a century of change under mainly colonial auspices, the dominance of the State, both administratively and culturally, has come to be taken so much for granted that there is little capacity among the Dusun intelligentsia (and this is particularly noticeable beside the workings of ethnic historical imagination in Indonesian Kalimantan) to dig up, or even "invent" an illustrious past to legitimate Dusun autonomy, in the way that the Sultanate rationalizes and legitimates its own "full Independence" from British tutelage. Since there was still a Bisaya kingdom on the Brunei Bay in the early 16th century, in contention with the Malay Sultanate for territorial control, it does not seem far-fetched to regard today's Dusuns as the remnant of a more widespread indigenous race that was settled well in advance of Malay penetration and hegemony along the northern Borneo coast. Yet any such historical reality seems devoid of any modern political relevance, even as a reference-point for the preservation of a Dusun ethnic identity. Although a handful of intelligentsia speak of the Bisaya identity of the first Brunei ruler, "Alak Betatar", they are most likely to have learnt the legend from modern Malay sources. There is no folk-memory of a Bisaya kingdom, and only a tiny minority of the speakers of the language within Brunei's present borders even call themselves "Bisaya". Above all, modern Dusuns understand, and accept as a matter of course, that the defining qualification for kingship for this indigenous folk-hero was to become a Malay, through conversion, and call himself "Sultan Muhamad". Thus the ambitious nation-building project of the contemporary Sultanate — effectively a strategy for general assimilation to Malay culture and Islam under Malay political leadership — does not necessarily forfeit credibility in Dusun eyes by claiming to enjoy "the blessing of the past".81</page><page sequence="23">As Night Falls: A Dusiin Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 23 If we may turn our gaze, lastly, to the temarok once again: at least the older generation can take some comfort in the fact that on the whole, or at least superficially, the ritual has not shown the symptoms of a withdrawal of the spirits, but still provides a stage for dynamic human and spirit interaction. Moreover, the crocodile-temaroK and the related snake-temarok still display in full contrast the perceived male characteristics of derato and the obviously feminine qualities of the belian. Meanwhile, as the myths continue to fall into oblivion, the temarok bitayo remains a context where the traditionally intimate relationship between the crocodile and Dusuns is still celebrated. But just as the crocodile has been driven to the edge of extinction in Brunei rivers by hunters from other ethnic groups, so also is the survival of Dusun religion now questionable in the face of cultural inroads originating not only from economic development but from the limitless pretensions of the State. The present essay has presented in some detail a ritual which has remained immune from the impact of Islam among its performers to date but has lost the support of many younger people. The sceptical or indifferent group includes potential female recruits to the priesthood on whom, more than anything else, the survival of the ritual and the religion would depend. Meanwhile, certain young intelligentsia who sense a need for cultural preservation seem prone to turn temarok into a choreographed "ethnic dance" performed for a wider public on public holidays and State occasions, rather than understanding and promoting it as a core ritual of Dusun life.82 In sum, if present trends continue, the value of the present record will prove to be "historical" as much as ethnographic. It will be left for a later study, or for other students, to interpret the contemporary spread of Islam in Brunei as "historical", in the context of a 500-year process: not a sunset but perhaps the ultimate triumph of light over primitive darkness. Notes The ethnography is exclusively from the hand of Eva Maria Kershaw, whose access to informants was through the medium of their language — a dialect of Bisaya — unless they were English-educated. She has published twice, to date, on aspects of the language and its oral literature: Kershaw, E.M. 1992; Kershaw, E.M. (ed.) 1994. Roger Kershaw's input relates to music, the history and the politics — the latter two dimensions reflecting his primary disciplines and knowledge of Malay (cf. Kershaw, R. 1998). The authors have combined for the passages of a comparative-religious nature. The two authors were resident in Brunei almost continuously between 1984-94. This estimate is derived from a judicious integration of Negara Brunei Darussalam, n.d.(b), and Negara Brunei Darussalam 1989. The former was part of a print-out of 1981 census data for internal bureaucratic circulation, which unlike all published census materials since 1971, including Negara Brunei Darussalam n.d.(a), did not submerge the Dusuns (and the Muruts) with the Malays (cf the disingenuously apolitical rationalization of this suppression in Negeri Brunei 1973:34). Given its figures of 7,348 for Dusuns and 125,717 for all indigenous, while the figures published in 1989 for 1986 show 155,533 for all indigenous — an apparent increase of 23.71 per cent — the same percentage increase applied to the Dusuns would bring their numbers up to 9,090. (This is only a rough and ready estimate, for there are multiple provisos which should be applied when using Brunei census statistics, e.g. the fact that global figures always</page><page sequence="24">24 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw include immigrants and transients of the same race from neighbouring countries. For further discussion see Kershaw, R. 1998.) The Brunei Nationality Enactment of 1961 recognizes seven ethnic groups as "indigenous" and thus "Malay" in a broad, constitutional sense: Bruneis (Malays of the Water Village, with their nobility); Kedayans (the agricultural Malays); Tutongs; Belaits; Dusuns; Bisayas; and Muruts. 3. The first three of the indigenous groups just listed are wholly Muslim; the Belaits now predominantly so. These are the groups encompassed in the term "Malay" in Negara Brunei Darussalam n.d.(b), as well as a long-established pocket of Muslim Dusuns at Telisai/Danau. 4. Negara "Melayn Islam Berajaa Malay, Islamic Monarchy. For an exploration of the origins, content and impact of this ideology, see Braighlinn 1992. 5. Cognates of the lexeme belian are found widely throughout Borneo: e.g., babalian, the Timugon "religious specialist" (Brewis 1993:10); bobolian, the Tempasuk Dusun "priestess" (Evans 1953:43); bobolian, or "person who knows the prayers", of the Kadazans in Bundu Tuhan (Bair 1966:45); babalian, the "spirit medium" of the Ranau Dusun (Harrison 1979:61); and balian, the "priestess" of the Ngaju Dajak (Schärer 1946:48). The Brunei Dusuns cannot, or can no longer, give any meaning to the term belian. Schärer, quoting N. Adriani, interprets it as "one who goes accompanied; who is possessed by that companion and thereby herself changes into someone other" (Schärer 1946:60). Evans (1953:43) relates it to bolian, "to buy" but although the Dusun active form for "to buy" is ball, the stem-form is mali, thus belian cannot be a cognate of it. 6. It is the possession seen at the beginning of the temarok ritual (the focus of Section 3) which involves control; unsolicited possession occurs later in the ritual. (Incidentally, not all belian are recruited by a divine call. However, if they are, it takes the form of a mildly schizophrenic disorder known as dayo-dayo, which would probably rank as an "affliction" in the terms of other literature on shamanism.) 7. For a discussion of a different model — involving graduation from unsolicited spirit possession to fully-fledged shamanship — see Lewis 1996:119. The argument that none of the current classifications employed to describe the nature or roles of religious specialists fits the Rungus bobolizan in Sabah (Appell &amp; Appell, 1993:3-6), is clearly relevant to the Dusun belian in Brunei too. Another noteworthy dimension of Dusun mediumship is the role of the belian, in part, as voluntary, contractual marriage partners to their familiar spirits (though they submit themselves to involuntary "possession" by spirits in ritual performances). (See Hamayon, 1995, Lecture 2, on the shamanic alliance with the spirits. Her Lecture 4 even explores the notion of the spiritual marriage as a "characteristic feature and a possible criterion" in defining shamanism. Yet if this is understood to mean "controlled possession" — the dominant shaman being in full control — it is in contradiction with the idea of a contract between equal partners. This is the case with the Dusun belian, where the spirit may take possession unsolicited — though the possession can indeed also occur in a solicited, i.e. "controlled", form.) 8. The term tebiai refers, strictly and basically, to seven parcels of boiled rice (four shaped as hens, three as cockerels); but for convenience its meaning is usually extended to include the seven tiny, fried rice-flour cakes or fritters (taji), plus one egg and several bananas, which together make up the standard offering on a tray. If an entire family places itself under a belian, the tebuu-set is offered by one member only. The belian in turn performs the monthly ritual. The yearly ritual involves the "freeing" of newly harvested rice. All this enables the anak nimok to eat the food. Anak nimok generally include the children of the belian herself, including any daughter who is a belian in her own right, and later her grandchildren; her husband, unless he had already belonged to a belian before his marriage and chooses to remain under that priestess's care; her brothers and sisters, and parents; any novice she initiates, even beyond the time when this new belian begins to make her own monthly offerings; and anyone who, after</page><page sequence="25">/4s Night Falls: A Dusitn Harvest Ritual in Brunei * 25 needing her help in sickness or otherwise, is advised by her to become one of her charges, permanently or temporarily. 9. Winzeler, 1993:xvii-xviii, cites the Kayan, the Melanau and the Ngaju as having both priests and shamans, with the priests being "part of both the religious and political establishment of society". Fora discussion of formalized priesthood, where the religious authority is vested "in the officè rather than in the person", contrasted with shamans "legitimized by possession" alone and "elected by the gods to hold personal charismatic commissions", see Lewis, 1989:139,156. Or again, it may be noted of priestly specialists, that "unlike shamans, their religious efficacy is not justified primarily by the presence of spirit helpers, but by their correct performance of formally-established rituals" (Rousseau, 1993:132). 10. The formulations of religion provide a workable framework of necessary form and order, being, namely, "the emotional correlate of the struggle for existence in an insecure physical and social environment" (Radin, 1957:5). Not far removed in spirit from this perspective is the approach which focuses first and foremost on symbolic action and is thus willing and able to call a great diversity of phenomena "religious" (Geertz, 1966). 11. The reformulation of Ngaju religion as Kaharingan has even been at the cost of bogus classification as a Hindu sect (Weinstock, 1981)! 12. For a further account (in some ways better informed than Weinstock, 1981) of the reformulation — and official recognition — of Ngaju religion as Kaharingan, see Avé 1982. 13. The notion of a Dusun creator is not a recent, opportunistic invention but is enshrined in ethnic myth: see, for instance, the folktale "Anak sepapas" ("The half-boy") and its variant "Anak sepapas nan batampa" ("The half-boy is released from a curse"), in Kershaw, E.M. (ed.) 1994:8-16. But certainly this creator lacks any central role in the religious dynamics of today. It seems difficult for Dusuns to live down, subjectively, their classification in official censuses as "free-thinkers". 14. The informal rule of Brunei-Malay Islam that a woman must seek her husband's permission to travel seems most unlikely to be embraced by convert families. Thus, inheritance and divorce may be the main area of tangible loss. 15. The term temarok encompasses all rituals officiated over by one or more belian in their ceremonial dress. 16. Older Dusuns constantly refer to the authority of their elders when commenting on religious principles and practices. 17. A term most likely cognate with the Sanskrit term devâ (deity, god, divinity). See MacDonell 1929. For an account of the first encounter between the Dusuns of the mythical past and derato, which acquainted the Dusuns with the heavenly rice and culminated in the promise wrung from those Dusuns to recognize the divine benefactor in perpetuity, see "The origin of Temarok", in Kershaw, E.M. (ed.) 1994:2-5. 18. The isi are found in trees; on rocks, slopes and hills; and in swamps and rivers. 19. Such as trying to get as close to humans as possible, or by resting for a long period on piles of clothing or on pillows, seemingly undisturbed by the people around it. 20. See note 6 on the condition known as dayo-dayo. 21. This refers to any belian who commands the necessary esoteric language with which to call derato (see below). 22. This term was used by the Appells (Appell &amp; Appell 1993:5) to describe the trance state of the Rungus bobolizan. Although the latter does not become "appropriated by any member of the spirit world" as the belian does, the term nevertheless seems apt in relation to the condition of the "appropriated" belian too. 23. Whether the same spirit answers her subsequent calls remains unclear to the author, as a belian is forbidden to talk about her ritual experiences outside the ritual. To ask questions of this nature during a performance would be equally inappropriate. 24. This may be a conscious rejection, or an unintentional breach of the food taboos imposed on a ritual dependant, or the unilaterally declared cessation of the status of dependant, including cessation on account of conversion to Islam.</page><page sequence="26">26 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw Each belian becomes host to one derato, individually, yet the situation can also be conceived in terms of a single deralo becoming plurally manifest in several belian. The ambiguity is not one which taxes Dusun minds. Generally made known in dreams. See note 6 above. .. Most monthly'rituals observed by the author had either been promised, or were combined with the treatment of elderly patients who refused to consult modern doctors, or patients whose illnesses modern medicine had failed to cure. Legends describe the crocodile as companion to the Dusuns in both forms, animal and human, and relate how in the latter guise it won the affection and love of many a Dusun maiden! Moreover, to this very day Dusuns of some villages still claim to be lineal descendants (waris) of the crocodile. Cf Black/State of Brunei 1937:31; and Kershaw, E.M. (ed.) 1994:xv-xvi. A quality shared only by the temarok lamit (the snake-temarok), which has an identical denouement. Yet because the Dusuns do not feel the same ease in relation to the snake, this ritual is only performed when explicitly called for by derato. The only known meaning of papa is "trunk of a tree". Whether the name papa was chosen for this anticipatory temarok because the sago-wood batons for making a spirit-house (tambyunguri) may be bundled up on this evening instead of being made up, or because it conveys the idea that a temarok papa is like the stem of a tree, to which the temarok makan parai forms the canopy, is no longer clear. This would have included nearly all Dusuns of the past, as few people would not have sought her service at some point in their lives. Performed in Bukit Udal, Tutong District, in May 1987. Should a death occur within the family or village, both rituals will have to be postponed for a minimum of forty days in the first case, and fourteen in the second. They would usually include those needed for the major ritual. Or indeed any other ritual purpose. This usually means rice cultivated by the Dusuns themselves, and not rice from abroad (mainly Thai) (agas kino), which has otherwise replaced the locally grown rice. Villagers were divided as to whether rice grown by other indigenous groups, such as the Kadayans, could be used in a Dusun ritual. Burak is pleasantly sweet and only slightly intoxicating. It is made from newly harvested rice by first cooking this, then adding yeast, and leaving the filtered juice to ferment for three days. For example four deep resonating gongs (agortg); three treble gongs (sanang); and four signal gongs (collectively, the taiuak family, named individually, in descending order of size, pembaa, tingknl kako, tingkul tari, penaritek). It is described as being the "companion" of the rarai (rumo rarai), or "one of a pair" (sa pa sang), as of a "shirt and trousers". The Dusuns have for many years bought their incense from Chinese or Indian shops, although there is tree-resin that could be, and probably once was, used for the purpose. The half of the coconut shell used is the part with the "nose" (adong tidi), i.e. the whorl at the end where the coconut was attached to the twig. The reason for this is that it had the upper position while still on the tree. Instead of the traditional coconut shell some households now utilize an enamel bowl. A fragment of shell of the egg is nipped off to ensure proper access for the spirits, and must remain on the tray (being part of the egg, though detached from it) until dawn. The seven chickens, with seven rice-flour fritters and one egg, plus one bunch of bananas (of usually seven fruit), are said to make up sa-pasang (one tebuu "set" or entity). The rice-fritters are usually placed in a glass, with the egg on top. More traditional households still weave a little basket for the taji from coconut leaves. While a tray with the tebun-set can be shared by two, even three households, belian trays cannot be combined. Where a minor belian does not bring her pieces of cloth, she does not need a tray for herself.</page><page sequence="27">As Night Falls: A Diisun Harvest Ritual in Brunei * 27 A third piece of black cloth may be added. These pieces of material are part of the paraphernalia required by a belian on her initiation. A major belian will take them along to all temarok, an ordinary belian often only to those close by. The bind could also be tied by a tiny piece of thread taken from the red fabric on the tray. The bundled cigarettes have to be lit and very briefly smoked before they can be deposited on' the tray. This is like an overture to the temarok, comprising three bursts of a special rhythm known as gandang ibang-ibang, then a few bars each of gandang lambat, aleo gandang and gandang parang. The once uniformly worn, long, black skirts with a black velvet tunic have generally given way to these colourful batik skirts and embroidered blouses (in the "baju kebaya" style of Indonesia), or, as worn here by the children, to the staider style of Malay dress, with Islamic connotations: a long skirt with matching smock (the "baju kurong"). The headband is made up of two narrow but long strips of material, one red, one white, braided and threaded through a ring which, being located at the back of the head, allows the headband to be tightened from there, and the ends to hang loosely at the neck or down the back of the wearer. If there is no ring, as is often the case with young belian, the headband is kept in place by a red cotton thread. The sash is slung over the right shoulder by right-handed, over the left shoulder by left-handed belian. The present-day sash in Bukit Udal is narrow and usually of lace and tied in a light knot at the side. Instead of this narrow stole, all belian of the past wore a large white piece of cotton held in place at the back by a metal belt and left hanging loose over the chest {tudong). The belian of some villages (Kebia and in the Belait district) still wear the tudong in preference to the stole. They carry no handkerchief, but use the tudong to wipe the perspiration off their faces, tie up a captured soul, or beat the open flames of candles. The handkerchief was introduced with the narrower form of sash and used consequently to wipe the face and retain the captured soul. The belian fold it twice and hold it in their left hand, if right-handed, and vice-versa. The fan is often very ornately decorated and carried, on the same principle as the sash, in either the right or the left hand. With the headband it is the only ritually important object. Both have gained emblematic status, and are thought to contain sufficient magical powers to demand special protection against theft from malevolent spirits. And yet, though absolutely essential in all other Dusun villages of Tutong, the headband is not worn by belian of Kebia. "The slow rhythm", alternatively called gandang temarok. It is not clear whether a single familiar spirit, or different spirits, successively unite with any one belian. The length of each union is said to be mirrored by her dance. When a belian appears to interrupt her singing to communicate the wishes of her spirit, or knowledge she has gained, to the community, the spirit almost certainly has already left her. The fact that so little is generally known about the relationship of belian and derato is due to the prohibition on her discussing this afterwards, as was noted above, note 23. The steps of aleo gandang fall at a rate of about 8 in 15 seconds, corresponding to the striking of No. 2 sanang (in Malay, canang: the high-pitched gongs) on the first beat of the bar. The preceding gandang lambat fits only 5.25 bars into 15 seconds; but it is likewise the No. 2 sanang which gives the first beat, and even then the belian dances at only "half" the speed of the rhythm (even though it is already slow), that is, by advancing a foot only in time with No. 2 sanang, on the first beat of each bar (rather than on first beat and middle beat). During a long drawn-out session, there will invariably be some substitution of players, especially on the more strenuous or demanding dombak, ntangan and sanang. Although no formal invitation has to be issued for the major temarok, the number of guests expected to be fed was not too large, so that the female relatives present (about 10) sufficed to carry out the various tasks.</page><page sequence="28">28 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw These milled, uncooked grains, coloured by saffron, are not an invariable requisite of a major temarok, but have to be requested by the belian or promised by the host in advance. All ritual animals and objects that can be brought to life have their own cloth, betel shoot, and — if they are one item in a multiple harvest-femarok offered by several people — their own spjrit-house. The shaft mentioned here could be omitted, as it has no other function than to hold up the cloth. One gantang amounts to 3.125 kg of rice. In this case an aleo gandang. A full orchestra needs, strictly speaking, eight players, preferably 10. She, an experienced belian, did not officiate on this occasion, but supervised the progress and acted as a vital go-between for the performing belian, the musicians and the lay community throughout the temarok. The "scales" are from a coconut, neither ripe (mancak) nor still very young (mbulok honor), but somewhere in between (briton) with an already dark nose (kuo mitom tumbong). In the past, a cannon had to be fired before the crocodile could be made up. This also served to inform anybody not present of its imminent emergence. Its seams are embroidered with coloured cotton threads, its slit at the front is closed by a large silver button of fine filigree-work, and a string of small silver bells around the sleeve hems (at about the elbow) tinkle cheerfully whenever the belian moves. Unfortunately the velvet and the silver ornaments are no longer obtainable. In days when these posts were rough-hewn, the more agile belian were reported to have climbed close to the roof. A slave of either sex was imprisoned in an enclosure and in the course of the night stabbed with spears by the "more daring" male bystanders (members of the settlement and their guests), and finally decapitated. Similar slave-killing was also practised by the Ngaju (Schärer, 1946:157). See also Wooley, 1936:26-28; Rutter, 1985:218-19. There was thought to have been an illness-agent left from the night before, which the belian detected and caught. It had to be taken the following morning, by a dukun (herbalist and magician), to a spot in the jungle earmarked by the principal belian. The rhythm which heralds the pouring of burak is exclusively the gandang sang loba. There was no other form of alcohol, in earlier times, than the two types of self-brewed rice-wine: the ritually used burak and the widely used and more potent pengasi (see further, note 74, below). For a harvest-temarok the latter, too, is made from new rice. Neither can, therefore, be tasted before the ritual. (Burak is drunk ritually during the temarok, but pengasi socially next morning.) In addition to this, the host-family and their guests were forbidden in the past, to drink any other alcohol (i.e. rice-wine brewed from old rice) from the moment the new burak was prepared three days before the ritual. It is still believed by those who adhere to the rules more strictly, that also no form of modem beverage, such as whisky or stout, should be drunk before the end of the ritual, and that the frequent breaching of this rule at present occasionally causes the belian to fall unconscious. As the principal belian on this occasion was tall, the material was well within her reach. Otherwise the sponsor of the temarok would have facilitated this by pulling the cloths a little way down. The kiiku narom has the potential to be "haunting", for older-generation Dusuns, because it evokes the defunct death's-head dance, bakukui. This is not the official and precisely-timed mourning period of 40 days. The earliest possible time for a kukui, as the entire process was termed, was after the 100 days' period. The death's-head procession within the grounds of the house was to the rhythm of gandang kuku (almost identical with kuku narom of the previous note). Again the position of the animal could not follow the guidelines. Because of the narrow rectangular shape of the room, its head had to face south. There are accounts of a belian occasionally praising the beauty of a young woman (rather than young man) who had risen from the pile. Whether she anticipated this apparition is not known, nor whether male belian in the past only conjured spirits in female guises.</page><page sequence="29">/4s Night Falls: A Dusun Harvest Ritual in Brunei • 29 The soul of the first animal returns to the realm of the crocodile-souls, but the soul of the second one lives on as a derafo-crocodile. If the belian were to send it to a river, it would pose a considerable threat to the ordinary crocodiles by its strength and wild nature. She therefore designates a small pond, lagoon or ditch nearby, as its destination. The number of such derafo-crocodiles in any one place is not limited. When the houses still had bark walls, a section facing towards the chosen new abode could be removed, to facilitate the passage. Today the nearest door or window has to suffice. This rhythm also serves to tell even distant Dusuns that the ritual has been concluded. In the old days, a cannon was additionally fired. This includes all the leftovers from making taji: i.e., any remaining coconut-oil, and flesh of the coconut, and any rice-flour not used, as well as the remaining fruit of the banana plant. The first to taste the offerings must be a belian, then only is it the turn of the lay community. Pengasi in the past, bottled liquors at the present day. Pengasi, that is left to ferment for a month, is made from a 50:50 mix of milled and unmilled rice with yeast added. Whether it will become popular again since alcohol has been banned in Brunei is doubtful, as skill and care is needed for its month-long preparation, to ensure that its taste is not sour (moncom). The plaited lances and wooden swords — used in the ritual, but of no ritual value — can be handed over to children for play. However, the now equally redundant spirit house, the lipan (spine and leg bones), the kelupat (padi-filled cushion), ntuko (stomach), the areca-palm shoot and areca-palm flower, must be conserved until their natural disintegration. They are invariably hung up on an outside wall of the house, where no further attention is paid to them. To this descriptive term used for the deity, the Islam-inspired name of Ratala was added at some stage in time. On the idea of a unitary creator, see also note 13, above. This is despite the normal restriction imposed on him by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. One circumstance in which this might occur is where a research group from the Brunei Museum, or TV team from Radio Televisyen Brunei, has come to make notes or recordings. Since so many young Dusuns are now employed in government service and reside in urban or semi-urban locations, they are more aware of the negative ethnic stereotypes which their non-Dusun peers — let alone bureaucratic superiors — entertain in their regard. Indeed, ignorant of their own religion in the absence of traditional socialization in village society, they may come to perceive it in terms of the out-group's doctrinal stereotype that brands any charismatic phenomenon as "non-religious" at best, more likely diabolical. On stratification in the society of Brunei in the past, see Brown, 1976; King, 1994. For a review of ethnic asymmetry from the linguistic aspect today, see Martin, 1995, and from the political aspect, Kershaw, R., 1998. Since the early 1990s, religious afternoon classes have been opened in the government Malay Primary Schools in Dusun areas, and official encouragement to non-Muslim children to attend does not seem to have been met by any significant resistance from parents. When applying for government scholarships, it is not unknown for "free-thinking" Dusuns to be challenged, as in Indonesia, to prove that they are not "communists". On the "two kingdoms" observed by the Italian traveller, Pigafetta, in 1521, see Nicholl, 1975:11. On the Bisaya identity of Alak Betatar and features of the ancient Bisaya population, see Carroll, 1960; Bewsher 1962. On the historiographical "invention" of a Malay-dominated past, and the (probably literal) invention of a 14th century conversion of the monarchy, see Braighlinn, 1993:28-31. The Brunei State is far more alert to the dangers of ethnic cultural revival than the Dusuns are to its potential for themselves. Precisely by limiting its boundaries and thereby excluding the Ibans (Kershaw, R. 1998), the Sultanate has avoided the necessity to conciliate large native groups. It rejected with</page><page sequence="30">30 • Eva Maria Kershaw and Roger Kershaw aplomb the application for the printing and official "registration" of a compilation of Dusun Custom (Jawatan Kuasa Penyusun Adat-Resam Puak Dusun Negeri Brunei, 1981). Even the synthetic "national day" of the Brunei Dusuns — called Adau Gayo ("the Big Day") — has not been recognized. Another disability that is taken for granted is the asymmetical rulgon conversion for non-Muslims wishing to marry a Muslim: cultural re alignment is reqüired from males (as well as females), in distinction to normal Asian usage. This is no doubt a logical extension of the transition from participant to onlooker, that was noted in the second paragraph of Section 3 (a), above. Paradoxically, choreographed culture not only reflects a distancing from primordial meaning, but reinforces it, by showing that the ethnic religion is undignified and not to be taken seriously, even though the original rationale of the exercise was to assert and project an ethnic identity.
