<plain_text><page sequence="1">POSITIVISM'S HEIR JANE DURAN SUMMARY. Several lines of argument support the notion that the legacy of positivism (if cast in terms of the realist/instrumentalist debate) is more realist than not. Work by Joia Lewis and Alberto Coffa on both Schlick and Carnap is cited, and contemporary work from Van Fraassen and Boyd briefly alluded to. Note is made of the differences within contemporary realist theory, and it is included that Carnap's essay "Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology" is crucial for resolution of the debate. In closing it is noted that the spirit of much of the original positivist work reinforced the contention than those who work within the framework of science do in fact accept the reality of key scientific entities. Key words: Positivism, Carnap, realism, instrumentalism, strict empiricism, Vienna Circle. Despite our tendencies to want to think of positivism, or of its legacy, in univocal terms, two strands in positivism manifest themselves throughout and lead, in turn, to the contemporary debate between theory more instrumentalist and theory more realist. On the one hand, if one were to categorize current philosophy of science solely or largely along the lines of the split between welt anschauungen views and realist views, for example, one might be inclined to think of realism as positivism's heir, since it clearly moves forward a more normative stance that at least has some pretense of claiming rationality for the scientific enterprise. But there is another way to think of the work that is done now, a way which makes the split between worldview theorizing and the new realism rather less important. If one focuses on positivism's respect for the raw data available to the senses, and if one continues to look for a linkage between that respect and contemporary theorizing, then the heir to the legacy of logical empiricism would seem to be some sort of instrumentalism. In this paper I plan to argue that positivism's true heir and executor is the new realism, but I also admit that the establishment of this line of inheritance is not easy. One of the reasons we find difficulty here is that there are notorious splits in the early positivist work - debates which sometimes go unremarked upon or ignored - that prevent us from easily drawing a family tree. In the first section of this paper I shall comment upon those fractures, and then go on to try to ground the claim that realism is the most important part of the positivist legacy.

SCHLICK AND INTUITION In a paper on the development of Schlick's views, Joia Lewis performed a valuable service for philosophers of science in reminding us of the origins of the realist/instrumentalist controversy in logical empiricism itself.1 As Lewis notes, "It is not well known that Moritz Schlick, whose name is inseparable from the development of logical positivism, was extremely critical of positivism, prior to the 1920s".2 In attempting to claim that Schlick to some extent misunderstood at least the Machian formulation of positivism. Lewis writes: His [Schlick's] early criticisms of positivism, particularly the fact that it ignored the significance of the logical and conceptual in favor of the immediately experienced, became the issues that he then had to deal with ... Schlick identified intuition specifically with the act of sensing, with the fleeting moment before the one who is sensing has become consciously aware of what it is one is sensing ... Besides this strict identification of intuition with the act of sensing, Schlick also identified intuition more generally with any philosophy that was 'anti-science' in attitude.3 Here we see, clearly set out, the early line in positivism that reminds us of contemporary instrumentalism or 'strict empiricism'. If one insists on focusing on 'intuition', as Schlick referred to it, then one is focusing on the preconceptual and - as Lewis goes on to argue - one may be guilty of preferring the "qualitative, sense-derived 'anthropomorphic elements' " over science itself. This is in fact, of course, what some have claimed the contemporary instrumentalists to be doing: as Van Fraassen notes in characterizing Boyd's view, Boyd is interested in "[the correctness of successful background theories] ... over and above correspondence on the level of observable fact";4 the instrumentalists presumably are not. But, as Lewis is concerned to argue, this line of construction of the positivist endeavor is only one interpretation, and may not even have been accurate at the time. (Part of Lewis' point is that Schlick has misunderstood Mach.)5 Should we then come to the conclusion that we have inferred too quickly if we think of strict empiricism as flowing from positivism? Schlick is far from being the only theorist who has interpreted positivism in this manner. The other side of the debate here revolves around the importance of the tie-in between correspondence rules and observation sentences. Conceptually speaking, this tie-in appears to have been a part of positivist doctrine from the outset, even if in some cases not fully articulated. The epistemological point here was to secure a foundation, and the initial foundation was 'incorrigibility'. Although the notion of the incorrigible flows directly from observation, one does not have a claim to the label 'incorrigible', so to speak, without conceptualization. Suppe writes of the epistemic importance of the data - a point somewhat different from the point Schlick attempted to make regarding Mach - in the following passage:</page><page sequence="3">POSITIVISM'S HEIR 27 [T]he problem of verification of assertions is reduced to the question of how observation language and protocol language assertions are to be verified ... For particular assertions ... the observation or protocol language would be a sense-datum language which would provide a phenomenalistic characterization of experience. There then would be no problem verifying observation or protocol language assertions since, by standard sense-data doctrines, the phenomenal descriptions of sense-data are known to be true in virtue of one's sensory experience.6 Thus epistemological notions appear to have more force here, but only for the purpose of providing the bedrock. The Vo terms rest on protocol sentences, which, at bottom, rest on sense-data claims which have been given the status of incorrigibility. Sense-data has a primacy, but perhaps not the primacy Schlick had asserted. The move from the data to something beyond the data is rapid and necessary. II. CARNAP, SEMANTICS AND THE GIVEN As I have indicated in the preceding section, there are a number of ways of looking at positivism's somewhat recherche history that emphasize various sorts of splits. Schlick's take on what he deemed to be Mach's position moves us in one direction; other commentators move us in other directions. A look at the change in Carnap's views during the 1930s is revelatory, I argue, precisely because it carves up the sides in still another way. A debate over what it was that Carnap was actually saying in the early '30s (before he read Tarski) gives us a handle on the rupture between the semantic and syntactic approaches to theory construction. If, as Coffa has argued, a number of historians and philosophers want to think of Carnap as having undergone an enormous theoretical change of heart because of the arrival of theory from Poland, we can see that the linkage we are being asked to buy is that between correspondence views and semantics, on the one hand, and cohering views and syntax, on the other.7 Whatever the merits or defects of various revisionist views of Carnap's history, one can see that this debate is as tendentious as it is precisely because it is understood that to match a theorist up with the correspondentists, as it were, is to force him to take a certain sort of stand. Although commentators (including Coffa) are reluctant to link this stand to realism, or even to physicalism, one can see from Schlick's attack on Machianism that failure to posit anything beyond the phenomena is, at least on one view, unscientific. In noting that Carnap was never as revolutionarily influenced by Tarski as some have argued, Coffa asserts: ...Tarski came along ... [w]hat happened then - as I should now like to argue - was philosophically less momentous than is generally thought. It is widely believed that Tarski's theory led Carnap to alter his views on the relationship between language and reality. I believe that it is much closer to the truth to say that what it did was to allow him to realize that he could express his old philosophical convictions in correspondentist language, without being thereby committed to a metaphysics or an epistemology that he found intolerable.</page><page sequence="4">28 JANE DURAN There is for the pre-semanticist Carnap a connection which is mediated by rules for 'the learning of an original language'. These rules, however, can't be explicitly formulated in any useful way; not because they deal with the domain of the showable-but-unsayable (whatever that may be) but because one does not teach a baby its first language by handing it a grammar and a dictionary.8 The most interesting remarks here are in the last clause of the last sentence - babies learn the language by a complicated process that involves ostensive definition and is mediated by the context of physical objects. The meta physical and epistemological commitments which Carnap wants to avoid are those that try to hypothesize the existence of a given that is prior to or independent of any conceptualization of it.9 Yet the significance of the correspondence views - as opposed to some versions of coherence views, the sorts of views that some want to accuse Carnap of having held prior to roughly 1936 - is that they do push one in the direction of buying an extralinguistic reality. The extremely miserly empiricist may not want to do so, but these careful sorts of distinctions are made only when one is in a theoretical pinch, as it were (and only when one is dealing with certain sorts of phenomena). The language of science has a realist flavor to it, and this is the language Carnap wants to employ.10 III. EXPLANATORY REALIST UNDERPINNINGS In criticizing what he takes to be the teleological structure of much of current realism, Van Fraassen reminds us that its knowledge-centered underpinnings are constitutive of an epistemology for dinosaurs. In other words, an after-the-fact analysis yields something (to the realist) that appears to have a structurally explanatory ring to it. He writes: But the 'pure case' of evolutionary epistemology apparently runs like this: We need methods of forecasting if we are to plan and hence if we are to survive at all. The methods we have been following are the methods of the most successful organisms on earth, namely, us. So they clearly have survival value. It remains only to show how, specifically, each feature of that methodology (as described by some account X, say, a list that includes inference to the best explanation) contributes to our fitness for survival. As Popper apparently first said, that is epistemology for dinosaurs.11 Here Van Fraassen argues that the realist asks us to buy too much, or to buy something with which we can perfectly well do without. But explanation seems to be the key here. The strain in early positivism that Schlick dubbed 'antiscientific' was in fact a strain that spoke only of the bare phenomena, at an uninterpreted level. As I have indicated before, although this might very well (and did historically) have a place in the rigorously foundationalist epistemology needed to support some versions of the correspondence rules, it is not at all clear that explanation did not play a much more major role at an early point, a role which leads directly to realism. Carnap was concerned about the connection between language</page><page sequence="5">POSITIVISM'S HEIR 29 and reality (or, as Coffa has it, about "the learning of an original language") because core distinctions, such as that between theory and observation, cannot be made without attention to these matters. As Darden has it, [A discussion] of theory and observation [shows]... that the philosopher of science concerned with the growth of scientific knowledge must not lose sight of the distinction the positivists had viewed from their more static perspective of that which is to be accounted for and that which accounts for it.12 Part of what 'accounts for something', presumably, is that which explains it (one might be tempted to say that this is, indeed, a very large part). To focus only on predictive power is to take a stance which in general is not part of the positivist project. In noting the importance of the unity of science thesis and the notion of potential reduction for positivism, Darden also asserts: None of the positivistic analyses proves to be adequate in understanding actual cases in science. But an examination of these informative failures aids us in asking better questions that lead to new problems and categories that promise to yield a more adequate understanding of the scientific enterprise. In so doing we must not lose sight of the important goals of the positivists of providing an understanding of the objectivity of science, the way in which science progresses and becomes unified. These constitute an important heritage from our philosophical predecessors.13 Here Darden reminds us that explanation was part and parcel of the original project, even if it was not always labeled as such. The new realism broke off from its predecessors by focusing on case analyses and inquiring where the 'success' of science lay; in such inquiry it showed itself to be at least some what more naturalistic, since the construction of logically tight overviews was not required. Nevertheless, the focus on epistemic success, as Boyd terms it,14 did not occur accidentally; the original positivistic analysis of progress and account of the reductionist unity of science also assumed such success. What one is inclined to say here is that there is a strong realist strain in much positivism that simply is not identified. In attempting to show that the Reichenbachian underdeterminists had shot themselves in the foot (and argued inconsistently), Glymour claims that "The arguments in the text seem to be of some force against an instrumentalist account of scientific discourse ..."15 The notions of explanation and the acceptability of evidence for theories seem to assume that there is some kind of linkage between language and the world, the very linkage about which Carnap had been concerned. Suppe also supports such a view in recounting some of the historical moves made with regard to the status of correspondence rules and Vt terms in the Received View. It is not merely that there is much (as has already been claimed here) that leads to some sort of realism; it is that to try to maintain the opposing stance one has to stretch oneself out on a theoretical rack. Suppe writes:</page><page sequence="6">30 JANE DURAN Maintaining an instrumentalist interpretation of the Received View poses a problem, how ever: Why are theoretical terms necessary?... Commitment to an instrumentalist interpreta tion [however]... does not call for the eliminability of theoretical terms. In fact, Hempel's dissolution of the theoretician's dilemma shows that theoretical terms generally are necessary under the instrumentalist interpretation of theories ... Nonetheless to allow theoretical terms while holding an instrumentalism leaves one in the uncomfortable position of holding that theoretical terms are necessary, but they do not mean anything or refer to anything. Rather than maintain such a position, most people who accept the legitimacy of theoretical terms in scientific theorizing also commit themselves to the position that they have real referents in the world...16 The original moves in philosophy of science at the end of the nineteenth century had been made precisely because without them there did not seem to be any way to account for the new physics - neo-Kantianism asked us to buy an a priorism which was unacceptable. But although the moves (Machian and otherwise) that followed this were intended to provide a manner of accounting for the phenomena, the strain in such views is realist because the new phenomena to be accounted for are presumed to be subject to explanation. Insistence that theoretical terms be tied in strict logical fashion to observation terms does not, as Suppe argues here, mean that the results of observation are purely instrumentalist. IV. THE FRAMEWORK OF SCIENCE ITSELF At an earlier point in the paper I alluded to the change in Carnap's views in the early 1930's and to Coffa's commentary on these changes. One might be inclined to think that another aspect of Carnap's work is immediately relevant here, since 'Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology'17 seems to address these issues. Like almost everything else which can be brought to bear on this debate - the question of whether realist or instrumentalist accounts are more directly related to the original positivist enterprise - some of the evidence presented in 'Empiricism' seems to cut both ways. After all, it can be argued, doesn't Carnap specifically say that"... the external question is not a theoretical question but rather the practical question whether or not to accept ... linguistic forms"?18 And isn't it clear that what Carnap means by 'external question' is a question along the lines of, in fact, the realistic question? The difficulty, of course, is that the counterargument here is rather strong. Given a certain framework, Carnap does indeed believe that parallel questions (questions about the existence of entities) can be asked within the framework - in fact, many situations will virtually demand that the questions be asked. It is questions about the acceptance/rejection of frameworks themselves that Carnap finds troubling. The critics of the use of abstract entities in semantics overlook the fundamental difference between the acceptance of a system of entities and an internal assertion, e.g., an assertion that there are elephants or electrons or prime numbers greater than a million. Whoever makes</page><page sequence="7">POSITIVISM'S HEIR 31 an internal assertion is certainly obliged to justify it by providing evidence, empirical evidence in the case of electrons, logical proof in the case of prime numbers. The demand for a theoretical justification, correct in the case of internal assertions, is sometimes wrongly applied to the acceptance of a system of entities.19 The importance of the foregoing should be obvious: most of the questions that are routinely asked in the realist/instrumentalist debate are, in fact, internal questions. Precisely because this is a debate about science, the framework here is the framework of science itself. Hence conflating the sorts of conundra that arise in scientific contexts with larger, old-fashioned metaphysical conundra casts the terms of the debate in a way that Carnap is concerned to argue against. Here the realists have their strong suit: it is the case that much of the success of science and its epistemic access leads to the acceptance of key entities. Individual realists may very well be wrong on certain points: some realist theories seem to ask for theories of reference with an odd ring to them.20 But portions of the realist debate are similar to the debate that Carnap characterizes as the 'internal questions of arithmetic'. The internal questions, he says, are "still open"; the question that he says cannot be decided meaningfully is the "external question of the ontological reality of the system".21 V. ACCEPTING THE REALISTIC VIEW Perhaps the most telling evidence of all is to be found in Schlick's origi nal essay 'Positivism and Realism'. This piece is noteworthy not merely for its persistent reiteration of positivist principles - what one can glean from the essay is a very nice distinction between metaphysical realism and scientific realism. This distinction is all the more pertinent since it is clear that in contemporary debate some of the terms in which scientific realism has been cast (particularly by some of its opponents) sound suspiciously like the doctrines of the metaphysical realism referred to by Schlick in the essay. The quick and simple answer to the question of the relationship between positivism and scientific realism is, on Schlick's view, that it is a comfortable one, for scientific realism can mean nothing more than the acceptance of the framework of science and its claims. Here Schlick reiterates some of what we just examined from Carnap in the previous section. But when Schlick attempts to cut off the ordinary confirmation/disconfirmation of statements already lodged within the scientific framework from the claims of metaphysical realism, he makes some interesting assertions about what the metaphysical realist is contending. [T]his principle ... [that the truth or falsity of all statements, including those about the reality of a physical object, can be tested only in the 'given'] has been wrongly construed as if it claimed or presupposed that only the given is real. Hence the 'realist' feels compelled to contradict the principle, and to set up the counterclaim ...</page><page sequence="8">32 JANE DURAN To this we ask: Well, then, how does one give an account of it? What do these words 'independent existence' and 'transcendent being' mean? ... Two answers are given here. The first runs: It makes a quite enormous difference. For a scientist who believes in a 'real external world' will feel and work quite differently from one who merely aims at 'describing sensations'. The former will regard the starry heaven ... with feelings of awe and devotion ...22 What is striking here is not so much that Schlick has set up an easy opponent (and he has, of course); what strikes one more is that what Schlick is describing here is 'metaphysical realism', and yet contemporary strict empiricists frequently speak of scientific realism in much the same vein. Van Fraassen claims that the realist exhibits a 'touching faith' (it must be akin to the feeling of devotion that one experiences with regard to the starry heaven), and that the realist wants to attain a level of "correspon dence" which "[p]ut conversely ... is ... if the theoretical structure enjoys adequatio ad rem, then hypotheses exploiting and building on that structure can be expected to do well..."23 The difficulty seems to be that contemporary scientific realism sometimes employs terminology (that of providing "approximate knowledge" of "the unobservable structures which underlie observable phenomena", for exam ple,24 that sounds suspiciously like the hyperbolic phrasing of the meta physical realists which Schlick, for one, is concerned to dismantle. But Schlick seems to have the upper hand here. Scientific realism is, after all, realism within the framework of science, and realism within the framework of science is not only not incompatible with positivism, but in some sense is a corollary of it. VI. POSITIVISM AND REALISM In this paper I have adduced several lines of argument to try to ascertain who or what is entitled to the legacy of logical positivism. At the beginning of the paper I noted that if we think of contemporary philosophy of science in terms of the easy-to-categorize dichotomy between Weltanschauung views and rationality views, it is not difficult to see that positivism's heir is the set of views that emphasize the rationality of science. But much more difficult to adjudicate, I claimed, is the split between the realists and the instru mentalists, or the realists and the constructive empiricists, because both sides can legitimately point to tendencies (especially in early work) within positivism itself that reinforce their respective positions. My opening line of argument recounted Lewis' synopsis of Schlick's early work, wherein it appears that Schlick may have misunderstood Mach, but that he construed the Machian doctrine in such a way as to emphasize its strict empiricist underpinnings. Then I examined Coffa's work on Carnap's development in the 1930s - while Coffa argues that Carnap never engaged in the complete turnarounds of which he has sometimes been accused, his analysis of Carnap's work during this period underscores the</page><page sequence="9">POSITIVISM'S HEIR 33 primitiveness of conceptual schemes and the difficulty of divorcing 'data' from such schemes. This particular line of analysis seems to support lines more realist than instrumentalist. Further historical work, some of it from Darden and some from Suppe, emphasize the extent to which explanation was an important factor in the enterprise of science for the positivists, and the way in which it was tied into (for Darden) the "important goal" of understanding the way science "becomes unified".25 Finally, two lines of recapitulation, one again from Carnap ('Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology') and one from Schlick ('Positivism and Realism') underscore the extent to which scientific realism is already incorporated in the language and framework of science. Although one might be tempted to keep score here, it finally is not important to place positivism's legacy in one of two camps. This is, of course, the point of much of the work in the last two pieces I cited from both Carnap and Schlick. The instrumentalist or strict empiricist is already doing science, and to do science, both Carnap and Schlick would claim, is to be in some sense a scientific realist.
