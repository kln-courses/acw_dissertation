<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING: HANS BLUMENBERG, GIAMBATTISTA VICO, AND THE PROBLEM OF ORIGINS* Samuel Moyn "To speak of beginnings is always to be suspected of a mania for returning to origins," the contemporary German philosopher Hans Blumenberg comments near the outset of Work on Myth, his monu mental tome on the subject of the role of myth in human culture. Evidently surmising that readers might attribute to him just this patho logical enthusiasm, Blumenberg moves quickly to disarm this pos sible misinterpretation of his project. He states categorically: "Noth ing wants to go back to the beginning that is the point toward which the lines of what we are speaking of here converge. On the contrary, everything apportions itself according to its distance from that begin ning." A few pages later, he reiterates this hostility to origins and even takes it in a more radical direction. It is not only inadvisable, for Blumenberg, to retrieve the moment of origin. It is impossible: "[T]heories about the origins of myths are idle. Here the rule is: Ignoramibus [We will not know]," he writes. "Is that bad? No, since we don't know anything about the 'origins' in other cases either."' From these characteristically gnomic statements it might seem that Blumenberg, along with modern philosophy in general, bids farewell to the ancient and early-modern obsession with the prob lem of the origins of language and culture. Perhaps, one might in terpret Blumenberg as saying, the long tradition of speculation on Qui Parle Vol. 12, No. 1 Spring/Summer 2000</page><page sequence="2">56 SAMUEL MOYN origins in the West, so rich in the classical period as well as again in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, had reached its inevitable obsolescence. Nothing, however, is further from the truth. Not only does Blumenberg have an account of (and perhaps even a mania for) origins, he more than any other recent philosopher revives the tradition that put an account of origins at the center of philosophi cal concern. In this paper, I would like to argue a simple point, that the core of Blumenberg's functional argument for origins has close and interesting affinities with, and may well derive in part from, a certain reading of Giambattista Vico's final New Science of 1744. The justification for such a basic philological undertaking seems twofold. First, Blumenberg is an extremely important figure in his own right whose arguments deserve to be clarified and related to previous sources. Sandra Rudnick Luft has claimed that "Blumenberg does not have a complex understanding of Vico, nor much interest in him,"2 but a quite different picture emerges with attention to the full sweep of Blumenberg's writings, especially those that have not yet been translated. And second, it is arguably in Blumenberg among contemporary philosophers that the ancient interest in the problem of origins in general and Vico's answer to it in particular have been preserved most insistently - though not, of course, whole and in tact. Blumenberg both selectively reads Vico's account of origins and radicalizes it by detaching it from its own local origins. Blumenberg is best known in the English-speaking world for his mammoth treatment of the origins of secular modernity out of the theological Middle Ages, The Legitimacy of the Modern Age.3 To the benefit of Blumenberg's fame, but probably to the detriment of a general appreciation of his broader project, this book came into translation at a fortuitous moment, just at the height of the moder nity-postmodernity controversy, even though it first appeared in Germany in 1966 in a quite different context. But though now so well-known for Legitimacy, Blumenberg is also author of many other books, not j ust The Genesis of the Copernican World, an account of the epochal transition that focuses more narrowly on scientific de velopments, but also many other massive volumes. Yet it is in Work on Myth that Blumenberg deals most explic itly with the transhistorical arguments that all of the vast historical</page><page sequence="3">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 57 narratives presuppose; the book amounts to his "theory of culture" in the broadest sense, with particular emphasis on the consequences of origins. Those above disclaimers notwithstanding, Blumenberg's book opens where his argument does: in the beginning. He tells his own story of origins. Work on Myth With the discovery of deep time, the encounter with new his torical cultures, and the accumulation of scientific and anthropo logical writings about both, it is now impossible to embark on an enterprise popular in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to produce a concordance of humanity's accounts of origins and arbi trate among their claims to originality. But Blumenberg abandons this level of inquiry only to move to a deeper one, a level that would have to inform any possible account of origins, and he transfers several of Vico's arguments from the one level, now obsolete, to the other. The two levels in question are those of substance and func tion, so that Blumenberg claims to abjure the problem of account ing for the content of myths in the plural in order to penetrate to their common and singular purpose.4 Blumenberg posits a "necessity of picturing an initial situation that serves the purpose of the old status naturalis," or a theoretical "limit towards which the extrapolation of tangible, historical fea tures into the archaic tends." He terms this initial situation "the ab solutism of reality" (WM, 3). According to Blumenberg, man experienced this absolutism as soon as he assumed bipedal pos ture, and found himself confronted by the undiscriminated totality of the world. Whatever may have been the appearance of the prehu man creature that was induced, by an enforced or acci dental change in the environment it inhabited, to avail itself of the sensory advantage of raising itself upright into a bipedal posture and to stabilize that advantage in spite of all of its internal disadvantages in the function ing of organs - that creature had, in any case, left the protection of a more hidden form of life, and an adapted</page><page sequence="4">58 SAMUEL MOYN one, in order to expose itself to the risks of a widened horizon of its perception, which were also those of its perceivability. (WM, 4) Reversing Edmund Husserl's claim that consciousness cannot exist without intending a specific object, Blumenberg writes that in the initial situation man feels a diffuse anxiety without any object pre cisely because preliminary distinctions have not yet been made. "[T]he whole horizon becomes equivalent as the totality of the di rections from which 'it can come at one'" (WM, 4-5). He later goes so far as to term the absolutism of reality "the single absolute expe rience that exists" (WM, 21). Culture and language originate in a bid to stave off the absolut ism of reality, through what Blumenberg calls the act "of an overcom ing, of the gaining of a distance, of a moderation of bitter earnestness" (WM, 16). Man calls language and culture into being in order to fo cus and particularize a generalized and therefore suffocating anxiety: for this reason, Blumenberg can helpfully present Work on Myth as a monumental gloss on a comment in Franz Kafka's correspondence that "the whole pantheon" amounted to nothing more or other than "a means by which the determining forces could be kept at a distance from man's earthly being, so that human lungs could have air" (cited in WM, 3). In this sense humans, for Blumenberg, never inhabited a pre-reflexive lifeworld but had to hew their own world out of an older, deeper, and totally alien reality. This argument by no means implies, however, that culture origi nates in specifically conceptual activity. Rather, man takes his leave of reality through the vehicle of names, through the conversion of "numinous indefiniteness into nominal definiteness" (WM, 25). So Blumenberg claims that even the encounter between the monotheis tic believer and his God, which would seem as absolute as an en counter can get, has been made possible through the particularization of that Other: "Das Andere [neuter] ist noch nicht vorzugsweise der [gendered, i.e., already particularized] Andere."5 Borrowing a preg nant phrase from Franz Rosenzweig, "the name breaks into the chaos of the unnamed," Blumenberg understands naming as the founding act of culture, through an "archaic separation of powers" involved in</page><page sequence="5">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 59 splintering the abstract unity and alterity of reality. The centrality of names provides the context for understand ing the most consequential move in Blumenberg's account, a speci fication of the name as a metaphor which becomes a myth: "What has become identifiable by means of a name is raised out of its unfamiliarity by means of metaphor and is made accessible, in terms of its significance, by telling stories" (WM, 6). It will help to keep this chain of concepts, name-metaphor-myth, in mind. Work on Myth contains much more, of course, than this assemblage of quo tations can convey, but it is on this level of sweeping and funda mental claim that this rudimentary investigation will operate. Excursus on Blumenberg's Immediate Antecedents: The German Tradition of Philosophical Anthropology I will argue that Blumenberg rejoins Vico in his formulation of this theory of human origins. But it is necessary to begin by dwell ing for a moment on Blumenberg's immediate predecessors in the tradition of "philosophical anthropology," inasmuch as they also concerned themselves at times with the origins of culture and lan guage.6 In brief summary, philosophical anthropology emerged dur ing the Weimar Republic in the thought of Max Scheler, and though Scheler and others in the nascent field sometimes claimed anteced ents as far back as Anaxagoras, they understood their movement as a new beginning for philosophy. The movement had its heyday, how ever, during the late republic and during the National Socialist pe riod, when most (though not all) of its exponents, including Arnold Gehlen and Erich Rothacker, either sympathized with the regime or openly colluded with it; this checkered past has proved difficult for the movement to transcend. The thrust of philosophical anthropology becomes clear when it is juxtaposed to its primary target, transcendental philosophy in the tradition of Descartes, Kant, and Husserl. Against the fondest wishes of that tradition to decontextualize inquiry, thereby purging it of all of its pre-reflexive and pre-theoretical determinants, philo sophical anthropologists of all stripes insist on the localization not just of individual consciousness but of human culture as a whole within the foreordained anthropological constraints that determine</page><page sequence="6">60 SAMUEL MOYN at least their potentialities.7 The goal here is to face squarely, and hopefully to solve, what Charles Taylor has called "the greatest in tellectual problem of human culture" that in some ways goes back to the nomos and physis debate among pre-Socratics, namely, "dis tinguishing the human universals from the historical constellations and not eliding the second into the first" or vice versa.8 Axel Honneth and Hans Joas formulate a similar if more complex definition when they define the science as "an enquiry into the unchanging precon ditions of human changeableness."9 Many philosophical anthropolo gists, including Blumenberg, ground their speculations about man's Wesen or "essence" in the natural scientific theories of their day, on the premise that man is first of all a biological organism. Though it is clear that some versions of this argument could - and did - un derwrite the most savage political commitments by rooting culture in race, in other forms it has become more and more plausible as the dissatisfaction with allegedly presupposition less transcendental philosophy has grown, so that even so reasonable a figure as Jurgen Habermas draws on the tradition along with some of its extra-Ger man representatives, George Herbert Mead among them. Blumenberg explicitly situates himself in this tradition.10 The question for these purposes, then, is the content he gives to human nature and the human condition, and whether he appropriated it from others among earlier philosophical anthropologists. And, though it is obviously impossible here to define Blumenberg negatively by exam ining all of his sources - that is, to show his innovation over his predecessors through a process of elimination - it will help to ex amine two precursors to try to specify his originality. In the essay most relevant to these questions, Blumenberg argues that at root two kind of anthropologies exist: those that take a positive view of man and those that take a negative one. He comes down clearly on this issue when he calls men Mangelwesen or creatures of deficiency. If privation is the lot of man, he also has one essential tool to try to compensate: rhetoric. "[R]hetoric starts from, and only from, the re spect in which man is unique: it is not that language is his specific characteristic but that language, in rhetoric, appears as a function of a specific difficulty of man's." Or, as he describes in a slightly longer passage:</page><page sequence="7">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 61 Man's deficiency in specific dispositions for reactive be havior vis-a-vis reality - that is, his poverty of instincts - is the starting point for the central anthropological ques tion as to how this creature is able to exist in spite of his lack of fixed biological dispositions. The answer can be reduced to the formula: by not dealing with this reality directly. The human relation to reality is indirect, circum stantial, delayed, selective, and above all "metaphorical."" Man relies on metaphor to compensate for inborn deficiency in dealing with the world. It is from Gehlen that Blumenberg most clearly derives many of his central theses. Gehlen first christened men Mange/wesen, and rooted his theory in biological arguments popular during his time that man came into the world premature, highly dependent and incomplete, and had to compensate for these primordial defi ciencies. Gehlen also helped introduce another notion important for Blumenberg: the centrality of decision and action to man, which makes it difficult if not impossible for him ever to escape or evolve beyond the conditions of his origins. As Blumenberg puts it, "To see oneself in the perspective of rhetoric means to be conscious both of being compelled to act and of the lack of norms in a finite situa tion."" But though Gehlen provides the anthropological base on which Blumenberg operates, he is not the source of the rhetorical "superstructure" that informs the Geistesgeschichte that Blumenberg undertakes in his best-known works. Yet other representatives of the tradition did emphasize the role of human signification. Among these other sources for Blumenberg, Ernst Cassirer probably ranks as second in importance. Cassirer developed in his works a conception of man as the animal symbolicum, grounding all of his various cultural productions in cluding language, myth, religion, art, and scientific activity in a more generalized notion of symbolization. While this argument clearly has affinities with Blumenberg's own theories of man as rhetorical, it is for these purposes more important to make two sharp distinc tions between them. First, as Blumenberg himself observes, Cassirer had a basically optimistic view of the essence of man that made it</page><page sequence="8">62 SAMUEL MOYN unclear how and why culture originated and began developing in the first place. "[T]his theory of Cassirer's makes no claim to explain why the 'symbolic forms' are set up: the fact that they appear, as the world of culture, allows us to infer to existence of the animal symbolicum, which manifests its 'nature' in its creations."" Sec ond, because of his Kantian allegiances Cassirer attempted to smuggle into symbolic thinking a potentiality for transcending primi tive metaphorical and mythic tendencies to achieve rational, logi cal thought. In fact he considers but dismisses the very possibility on which Blumenberg seems to insist, that the source of culture "is supposed to be speech, which by its originally metaphorical nature begets myth."14 But Blumenberg does not consider logic one among other originary potentialities of mind or language, but rather as para sitic on the inescapably metaphorical and mythic constitution of culture and language from their origin. In these views he is unique among his peers in the field of philosophical anthropology; he is not, however, in the long history of philosophy. The Vichian Foundations of Blumenberg's Project Both Vico and Blumenberg began their careers with anti Cartesian manifestoes. In his first public orations on assuming a chair of rhetoric at the University of Naples, as well as in his first pub lished work, On the Study Methods of Our Time, Vico touted the virtues of the ancients as a Christian response to the impious and dangerous thought of his own time.15 In a way, Vico also rooted his work in an anthropology, what Mark Lilla calls a "profoundly unmodern reading of human nature"16 that followed from his Ca tholicism and unswerving belief in man's fallen state, and it led him to search for counteragents to the acids of modernity. At first, he found them in tradition and a certain ancient ideal of rhetoric: "A critical note directed against the theoretical speculations of the phi losophers can be heard in the Roman concept of the sensus com munis," as Hans-Georg Gadamer once expressed it, "and that note Vico sounds again from his different position of opposition to mod ern science."' But though he may have always remained nostalgic for the quasi-authoritarian order Roman civil society featured, an order</page><page sequence="9">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 63 rooted in moderation, eloquence, prudence, tradition, and the other virtues of anti-theoretical phronesis, Vico may eventually have revo lutionized from within the tradition of rhetoric in which he needs to be situated. For there are different styles of anti-Cartesianism, and it is essential to grasp the one that Blumenberg both adopts and at tributes to the mature Vico of the New Science, because it differs decisively from the anti-Cartesianism of Gadamer and the early Vico. Schematically, the difference is between a conception of rhetoric most associated with Rome that binds eloquence and wisdom to gether and stresses the importance of this compound to the stability of public life, on the one hand, and an alternative conception that attributes what one may call ontogenetic capacity to language, on the other. Blumenberg, though he does not repress the first sense, clearly relies upon the second in his philosophical anthropology and, more importantly, interprets Vico as the first philosopher ever to have recognized it.18 Blumenberg made his first major appearance on the philo sophical scene with a long essay entitled "Paradigmen zu einer Metaphorologie," or paradigms towards a metaphorology, published in the Archiv far Begriffsgeschichte in 1960. Blumenberg began tellingly when he explicitly situated himself in the ongoing philo sophical battle joined by Vico against the Cartesianism of the day. Following his teachers, Blumenberg had adopted the project of Begriffsgeschichte, or "history of concepts." But he had chosen to resituate the project of Begriffsgeschichte on new foundations, as he implied at the very outset of the article. In a statement that as sumes special importance when it is realized that it serves as the introductory claim to an oeuvre now over four thousand pages long, Blumenberg noted: It was Giambattista Vico who first saw that the logic of [Descartes'] rule denatures [entwesentlicht] history and therefore opposed a "poetic logic" to it. He thereby started from the assumption that the clarity and distinctness de manded by Descartes could apply only to the relation ship of the creator to his work: verum ipsum factum. What remains for man? The "clarity" not of what he had been</page><page sequence="10">64 SAMUEL MOYN given, but what he had himself begotten [die von ihm Erzeugten]: the world of his images and creations [Bilder und Gebilde], of his conjectures and projections, of his "imagination" in the new productivist sense that the an cients had not known.19 If Blumenberg pursued a history of concepts, it was precisely be cause he rejected Descartes' aspirations for a final vocabulary ad equate to reality and insisted on the constitutive role of metaphor in human cognition. On the premise that man could only know what he had made, and more specifically with the metaphors he had invented and then literalized, Blumenberg proceeded to undermine the foundations of Cartesian confidence by returning to history not simply as an affirmation of importance and inescapability of tradi tion but more fundamentally as the only way to self-knowledge through a genealogy of the metaphors which have underwritten philosophical activity, above all metaphors for truth.20 For this rea son Richard Rorty can approvingly cite Blumenberg as a writer who has broken through to the only kind of philosophy now legitimate: the project of comparing historical vocabularies (that is, metaphors and their literalizations) without any underlying assumption that there exists some ultimate or ground vocabulary with which they need finally conform.21 I can now turn to the New Science itself and, with the help of commentators, demonstrate at greater length the interpretation of Vico and origins that Blumenberg has in mind. Jules Michelet once called Vico's masterwork "the little Pandaemonium," but it is noth ing compared to the larger Pandaemonium of Vico commentary, especially in the postwar period.22 Schematically, however, authori ties on Vico fall into four camps: "moderns," who emphasize Vico's anticipation of the great philosophies of history of the nineteenth century, and sometimes even celebrate him as a prophet of the lib eration of a humanity that because it made its own society could unmake it and remake it; "anti-moderns," now led by Mark Lilla, who stress the persistence of Vico's antipathy towards the new phi losophy and his belief that the depravity of man necessitated blind submission to tradition for the sake of order; "counter-moderns,"</page><page sequence="11">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 65 exemplified by Isaiah Berlin, who sees Vico as the first critic of the anti-historical tendencies and alleged monism of the Enlightenment; and, finally, "postmoderns" tracing their lineage back to Vico, and who focus on Vico's theories of the constitutive role of language, rhetoric, and myth in human culture. These camps all believe they are speaking about the same person, but the last camp draws the attention of anyone interested in origins because it is a subject in which proponents of this interpretation revel while the others tend to ignore or repress it. In The New Science Vico claimed one central accomplish ment, a "master key of this Science," and he did not hesitate in a number of passages to congratulate himself about it because it had taken so long for him to find. This "discovery," so Vico declared, "cost us the research of almost all our literary life, because with our civilized natures we [moderns] cannot at all imagine and can un derstand only through great toil the ... nature of these first men."23 Anachronistic conceits (borie) of the nations and the scholars (??124 8) had needed to be overcome "[t]o discover the way in which this first human thinking arose in the gentile world," and Vico "encoun tered exasperating difficulties which have cost us the research of a good twenty years." Finally, however, Vico had succeeded in de scending "from these human and refined natures of ours to those quite wild and savage natures, which we cannot at all imagine and can comprehend only with great effort" (?338, see on this point ?378 as well). It is there, in a reinterpretation of human (or, more precisely, gentile)24 origins, that Vico grounded his new science. The master key that Vico claimed to have found in his descent is that the first men spoke (mutely) in caratteri poetici, or poetic characters. These characters are indissolubly tied in Vico's concep tual arsenal with both myth and fable, so much so that they are basically interchangeable, and those in turn depend on a revital ized and transformed inheritance from classical rhetoric: metaphor. Vico famously claimed that "every metaphor ... becomes a little myth ( [O]gni metafora sl fatta viene ad essere una picciola favoletta)" (?404), and nothing illustrates this process better than the first ex ample: Jove. Drawing on a long Epicurean-Lucretian tradition, Vico saw terror providing the impetus for men to begin their own history</page><page sequence="12">66 SAMUEL MOYN (?382), specifically in the reponse of the "stupid, insensate, and horrible beasts" (?374) to the first thunderclap two centuries after the Flood. Thereupon a few giants, who must have been the most robust, and who were dispersed through the forests on the mountain heights where the strongest beasts have their dens, were frightened and astonished by the great effect whose cause they did not know, and raised their eyes and became aware of the sky. And because in such a case the nature of the human mind leads it to attribute its own nature to the effect, and because in that state their nature was that of men all of robust bodily strength, who ex pressed their very violent passions by shouting and grum bling, they pictured the sky to themselves as a great ani mated body, which in that aspect they called Jove, the first god of the so-called greater gentes, who meant to tell them something by the hiss of his bolts and the clap of his thun der. ... Thus, in accordance with what has been said about the principle of the poetic characters, Jove was born natu rally in poetry as a divine character or imaginative univer sal. (??377 and 381; see too ? 379.) It is easy when confronted with this story of foundation to operate on the level of substance and stress the generally anthropomorphic and specifically corporeal imagination with which the first men in vent Jove. From this point of view Vico made little innovation over Xenophanes. At a deeper level, however, Vico may have been the first to insist on the metaphorical process without which Jove could not have received any attribute. As Gianfranco Cantelli, the foremost interpreter of Vico's complex theories of language and myth, has put it, Vico understood that "[t]he fabl[e of Jove is the first metaphor that, interpreting the sky in a particular way, and with the sky the entire universe as it appeared to the first men, gives human history a beginning."25 And soon enough, as Vico argues, the first men went on to create other gods, through similar acts of metaphor. What needs to be recognized for these purposes more than any</page><page sequence="13">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 67 particular detail is that, as Cantelli argues and as Blumenberg under lines, those metaphors (and therefore language and myth as well) have in Vico's account an essentially ontogenetic capacity: ontogenetic in the sense that they are, from the perspective of the first men, not just names for independent things but the things themselves. Only later, as Vico himself writes, "these vast imaginations shrank and the power of abstraction grew, [and] the personifications were reduced to diminu tive signs" (?402). But in the beginning, a meaningful distinction be tween word and thing did not exist because they were the same, and if this is true then the things did not pre-existthe words. Concretely, "Jove" is not a name designating a god designating the heavens, but all three indissociably. (In this sense, when Vico in the above citation said that the first men became aware of the sky, "sky" could only have been shorthand for "what men now call the sky.") The same applies on the more general level. "Myth and fable are not a fantastic way to construe what is not fantastic and for which there exists another, proper, 'ad equate,' independent way to be expressed," Cantelli observes. "Reality is as fantasy construes it."26 Or, as Blumenberg puts it in Die Lesbarkeit der Welt in a passage on Vico that has enormous implications for the meaning of any cultural production including science, "We understand only what we have made, and we understand other things, what we have not made, precisely only by taking a detour through what we have made. Metaphor ... is, thanks to its 'artificiality,' this detour through the self-made. To this extent it is still, despite all the necessary care taken against idealistic pre-reflexivity, a 'transcendental' element. There fore it creates experience, without originating from experience."27 For the first men metaphor therefore created an entire world, one that they could not have had any other way. The Return and Retreat of the Origin In the earliest essay he composed on metaphor, Blumenberg may have cited Vico as an important and perhaps the most impor tant of his progenitors; but he also introduced an important criti cism of Vico. "The [Platonic or Cartesian] equation of metaphoric and inauthentic discourses becomes questionable; already Vico ex plained metaphorical language to be as authentic as the language usually taken to be authentic," Blumenberg argued. "[H]e only fell</page><page sequence="14">68 SAMUEL MOYN back into the Cartesian system inasmuch as he reserved imaginative language for an early period in history."28 Vico had only erred, so Blumenberg claimed, in seeing "poetic logic" as only an original phenomenon instead of a transhistorical one. At the origins of his own career, in other words, Blumenberg insisted against what he took to be Vico's position that the meta phorical foundation of culture could not be overcome as Descartes had hoped. Yet Blumenberg does not seem to have drawn the full consequences of the position he had adopted, as the very title of his first statement implies. "The resulting 'typologies of histories of metaphors,"' David Adams has even claimed, "is intended to cir cumscribe the realm of metaphor, clearly distinguishing it from other modes of consciousness: the rational, the mythic, the symbolic. The very title of the work - 'for' or 'toward [zu] a metaphorology ' implies a Cartesian trajectory towards greater rationality in human activity, a trajectory towards a science (logos) of metaphor." But Blumenberg had to choose between the assumption that informed his whole enterprise and the hope of making full conceptual sense of it. In opting not to abandon the Vichian insight, however, Blumenberg made a fateful choice. "The development of an anthropological ter minus a quo [the argument for origins] for metaphorology has coin cided with a growing recognition of the metaphorical nature of philosophical anthropology."29 As a result, Blumenberg's accounts have become more circular, fictive and playful - hence the strange am bivalence about origins with which this account began. He does not offer Work on Myth, for example, as a theory of myth from the out side, because "only work on myth - even if it is the work of finally reducing it- makes the work ofmyth manifest" (WM, 10). His works can claim only provisional status and can only in the end add to the stories they purport to explain. Interestingly enough, in making his choice Blumenberg brought Vico with him. Twenty years after "Paradigmen zu einer Metaphorologie," in a book dedicated to the persistence of the metaphor of "the book of nature" into the modern world, Die Lesbarkeit der Welt3 Blumen berg returned to Vico once more, and provided an account that had quite different implications than his first. The metaphor of the book of nature had been invented according to the logic of the first men,</page><page sequence="15">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 69 whom Vico saw making nature intelligible and bearable by inter preting it through phantasmatic projection, and "[t]hey could only do that inasmuch as they understood nature itself as a language: as Jove's language." Nonetheless, just the interpretive principle that had permitted Vico this insight into the earliest men, the verum/ factum principle, forced Vico to reconfigure the metaphor of the Book of Nature. Paradoxically, the cognitive breakthrough to the convertibility of the made and the known meant that the brute world could no longer be understood, with the first men, as legible: if God had authored nature, only he could read it, so it became illegible to man. "After the fundamental principle of the convertibility of the known and the self-made," Blumenberg comments, "the Book of Nature closes." This interpretation would seem to be in line with the one he proposed originally, where Vico only penetrated to metaphor through claiming to escape its effects. But, so Blumenberg goes on to argue, Vico does not abandon the power of metaphor in general or the power of the metaphor that had so deeply informed the Middle Ages. Citing Vico's De antiquissima Italorum sapientia ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda (On the Most Ancient Wisdom of the Italians Unearthed from the Origins of the Latin Language) of 1710, Blumenberg claims that Vico closed the Book of Nature only to re coup the trope which figures the world as a text as a figure for figu ration itself, a metaphor for man's need and power to master the world through myth and metaphor: "Its metaphorical potential pro vides man with the possibility of crafting his own world out of and against an estranged nature [aus einer Fremdnatur eine Eigenwelt zu machen]. ... To live with what we have not made and could not make, is our art and is also therefore the only art." He added: "It is Vico's metaphor for metaphor itself."31 Now he has Vico join him again in the endlessly reinterpretive art of making sense of man's metaphorical art. If one remains within the horizon of origins imagined by Vico and followed by Blumenberg, the juxtaposition of these mutu ally conflicting arguments raises interrelated difficulties about meta phor and about Vico's interpretation of it. Either man eventually escapes the conditions of h is origins but may penetrate back to them</page><page sequence="16">70 SAMUEL MOYN or remains subject to poetic logic and cannot even be confident of claiming that he must have always been so. Either Vico restricted metaphor to origins and achieved a non-circular system or he did not and failed to recognize that he had called his own story of ori gins into doubt. Vico, Sanskrit, Blumenberg Whether it is possible to resolve these difficulties or even whether they exist - a non-metaphorical theory of origins does not entail them - I am not sure. Perhaps it will help, however, to conclude by recalling a simple fact about the history of the question of origins that separates Blumenberg radically from the Vico with whom he has so many other affinities. Contrary to intuition, the scientific revolution in whose aftermath Vico operated briefly re-opened, rather than closed, the problem of origins. One orthodoxy of origin - the Biblical-Mo saic one - only gradually gave way to a scientific worldview and involved a trifurcation of the question of the beginnings of the world, of man, and of language into three domains requiring three separate accounts where before one story had managed to construe the world, man, and language as essentially the same age. The discovery of fos sils and the possibility of what Leibniz called le sombre abime du temps set off a European-wide debate with the most profound meta physical stakes in which the old account did battle with ancient ac counts -Aristotelian, Stoic, and Epicurean - newly considered and with genuinely original ones invented at the time. This extremely rich period, in which Vico represents only one actor, has only begun to be recovered but even now probably deserves to be seen as the richest moment on the problem of origins ever.32 But most importantly for these purposes, it remained possible, despite the burgeoning mass of natural scientific and anthropological data, to produce a concordance of humanity's groups and their stories of origins. Vico's New Science opens not just with an icon, but with a chart which includes all of the world's mythologies and ranks them in terms of their antiquity. Vico still thought he could plausibly argue that neither the earth's age nor that of any other nation exceeded that claimed by the Bible for the Hebrews-in Vico's time, about 5,500 years. But the possibility that remained opened for Vico has closed</page><page sequence="17">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 71 for Blumenberg. Deep time radically shifted the relationship of man to nature, so that even if (as philosophical anthropologists always insisted) man has a place in nature, it is an infinitesimally small one in a nature that long preceded and will long survive him. But if one is to believe Cassirer, not just deep time, but another more signifi cant event shut the door and totally recast the problem of origins both in its classical and eighteenth-century forms: the discovery of the Sanskrit language, a find whose "importance and influence may be compared to the great intellectual revolution brought about through the Copernican system in the field of natural science": The Copernican hypothesis reversed the conception of the cosmic order. ... In the same sense the acquaintance with Sanskrit literature made an end to that conception of hu man culture which saw its real and only center in the world of classical antiquity. Henceforward the Greco-Roman world could only be regarded as a single province, a small sector of the universe of human culture. The philosophy of history had to be built on a new and larger basis.33 Blumenberg operates after these epochal shifts and many others, and could not have ever countenanced Vico's bold attempt to pro duce a concordance of origins, and to hope to deal with the prob lem he had to move Vico's argument to the functional level. He thereby took a fateful step whose results have been described; it did not create the self-reference problem, but it made it especially acute. Blumenberg operates in a new problematic of origins that helps determine the circularity that afflicts both his account of origins generally and his interpretation of Vico specifically. By the time of the last book he published in his lifetime, H6hlenausg&amp;nge (Exits from Caves), Blumenberg has made more clear the status of his ruminations about origins as thought experi ments, as the status naturalis had usually been for contract theorists. The first chapter, entitled "Remembering the Beginning," now opens by claiming the impossibility of thinking an origin, expressly adopt ing Aristotle's argument that the world must always have existed for this reason. But it is not, as in Aristotle, an ontological claim, but only one asserting the limits of humanity's essentially metaphorical</page><page sequence="18">72 SAMUEL MOYN self-knowledge.34 Blumenberg broke through to the view that makes his own anthropology, and therefore his own account of origins, only metaphor. In the end, it is not an "objective" historical claim, but only a projected epistemological fiction based on a theory of man as inextricably caught in a web of metaphor and myth that he himself has spun - and that, so it would seem, he must have begun spinning. For Blumenberg as for Vico culture begins as a response to terror with the only weapon man possesses: metaphor. But if that logic continues to underwrite cultural activity through the present, then, as Blumenberg came to see, even the attribution of a begin ning that it would seem to entail cannot escape its own circular implications. * This is a paper that I wrote for a seminar on "Theories of the Origins of Culture and Language from Homer to Vico" taught at Berkeley in 1995 by A.A. Long and the late Amos Funkenstein, both of whom I thank, along with Martin Jay and Ania Wertz. It has not been updated to reflect more recent Blumenbergiana.</page><page sequence="19">METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING 73 1 Hans Blumenberg, Work on Myth, trans. Robert M.

Blumenberg's reliance on Gehlen on the topic of self-preservation also becomes clear in The Legitimacy of the Modern Age, esp. 138-91. Gehlen also pioneered in Urmensch und Sp?tkultur the notion of constraining institu tions erected to compensate for instinctual deficit, a concept which Blumenberg takes over, with one essential modification, in Work on Myth. 13 Ibid., 438.

I am sorry I cannot deal at greater length with the issues here, because they are complex and fascinating. In a longer account it would be necessary to emphasize the role of naming and of dealing productively with fear that Cassirer assigns to myth.

Allan Megill has warned against the postmodernizing anachronism of attributing to Vico an aestheticist position which gives rhetoric the second, strong meaning.

In another context it might be worth showing the effect reading Blumenberg has had on Rorty's own views, notably including a reversal on Francis Bacon to an increasingly affirmative view of modernity construed as a project of Baconian self-assertion. 22 Peter Burke, V7co (New York, 1985), a Past Masters title, is good on the reception. 23 The New Science of Giambattista Vico, trans. Thomas Goddard Bergin and Max Harold Fisch (Ithaca, 1984), ?34. I will cite this in the text by paragraph number, not by page. 24 The issue of Hebrews versus gentiles is an interesting one. Some, like Lilla and Paolo Rossi, see it as central, while Amos Funkenstein has said that "[p]erhaps only caution caused Vico to exclude from his scheme of corsi e ricorsi the chosen people, that is, Jews and Christians. No such caution prevailed in later versions of'reason in history'." Funkenstein, Theology and the Scientific Imagi nation from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century (Princeton, 1986), 205. No such caution prevails either in Blumenberg's "metaphor in history." 25 Gianfranco Cantelli, Mente corpo linguaggio: saggio sull'interpretazione vichiana del mito (Florence, 1986), 44. This book supersedes the author's own "Myth and Language in Vico," in Tagliacozzo and Verene, eds., Giambattista Vico's Science of Humanity, as well as several articles by other authors scat tered in collections. But see also the subtle work of Verene, Vico's Science of Imagination (Ithaca, 1981), Ch. 3. I should say that Blumenberg does not fol low Vico's argument about the "corporeal imagination" (?376) of the first men, perhaps because this point drops out on a functional account. 26 Cantelli, Mente corpo linguaggio, 47. Italics added. See, too, Cantelli, "Re flections on the Vichian Thesis That the Original Language of Humanity Was a Language Spoken by the Gods," New Vico Studies, 11 (1993), esp. 9. 27 Blumenberg, Die Lesbarkeit der Welt (Frankfurt, 1981 ), 175. Though somewhat tangential, it is interesting to note that a member of the contemporary field of "glottogenetics," dedicated to imagining the most plausible scenarios of the ori gins of language based on contemporary scientific theory, has returned to Vico as an important source. The author, Marcel Danesi, has a chapter on "the metaphoricity hypothesis" on the grounds that Vico discovered "the evolution ary link between perception and conceptualization." See Marcel Danesi, Vico, Metaphor, and the Origin of Language (Bloomington, Ind., 1993), 121 and passim.

He cites Derrida on the "impossibility" of a "metaphorology of philosophy": "If one wished to conceive and to class all the metaphorical possibilities of philosophy, one metaphor, at least, would always remain excluded, outside the system." Jacques Derrida, "White My thology: Metaphor in the Text of Philosophy" in Margins of Philosophy, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago, 1982), 219-20. The two key essays for following the de velopment of Blumenberg's theory of metaphor are "Beobachtungen an Metaphern," Archiv f?r Begriffsgeschichte, 15, 2 (1971): 161-214, and "Pros pect for a Theory of Nonconceptuality," appended to Shipwreck with Specta tor: Paradigm of a Metaphor for Existence, trans. Steven Rendali (Cambridge, Mass., 1997). 30 Blumenberg had been preceded on this general theme by Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York, 1958), Ch. 16, as well as Rothacker, Das "Buch der Natur": Mat?ri?i?n und Grunds?tzliches zur Metapherngeschichte, ed. Wilhelm Perpeet (Bonn, 1979), but the former does not mention Vico and the latter, a concordance of quotations culled from the author's Nachla? by a student, cites only the two obvious passages of the New Science (??32-34) and does not provide any interpretation of them. See too Michel Foucault's discussions of the Renais sance episteme in these terms in The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York, 1971 ), Ch. 2, "The Prose of the World," esp. 27 and 34-5. 31 Blumenberg, Die Lesbarkeit der Welt, 171, 173, and 175. The passage Blumenberg marshals to his defense: "Thus, Aristotle's Categories and Topics are completely useless if one wants to find something new in them. One turns out to be a Llull or Kircher and becomes like a man who knows the alphabet, but cannot arrange the letters to read the great book of nature. But if these tools were considered the indices and ABC's of inquiries about our problem [of certain knowledge] so that we might have it fully surveyed, nothing would be more fertile for research.
