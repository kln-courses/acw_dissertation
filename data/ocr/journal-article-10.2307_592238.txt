<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLE III. MATERIALS FOR THE HISTORY OF THE MUHAMMADAN DOCTRINE OF PREDESTINATION AND FREE WILL: COMPILED FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES. BY EDWARD E. SALISBURY. Presented to the Society May 20th, 1863. THIS collection of materials for the history of opinion, in the Muhammadan world, as to the relations between divine sove- reignty and human freedom, is presented to the Oriental Society with full consciousness of its incompleteness and want of a more thorough elaboration. But the interest of the subject may, per- haps, be relied upon to make up for all imperfections in the pre- sentation of it; and the more, as it is not known that any one has as yet treated the subject specially, in the way now proposed. My plan is first to bring together some of those expressions of the lyric muse of the Arabs, either uttered before the time of Muhammad or early post-islamic, effusions of grief or vauntings of heroic ardor, which indicate the direction of the Arab mind, at that early period, with respect to the two opposite phases of belief based upon the consciousness of personal human efficiency, on the one hand, and the persuasion of a superhuman overruling power, on the other. I will then endeavor to show, somewhat in detail, though not exhaustively, the teachings of the Kuran and the opinions of Muhammad as handed down by tradition: on the subject of predestination. The last part of my paper will be given to the presentation of various opinions to which Muslim theologians and philosophers were led, when the same great theme was revolved and labored over by them, under the inspiration of fresh scientific ardor.</page><page sequence="2">E. E. Salisbury, 1. Judging from remains of the most ancient poetry of the Arabs, their inmost souls, in "the age of ignorance," gave back no reflection of dreaded or devoutly worshipped divine power. Though they had their named deities, whose images were set up in the Ka'bah, and practised sacrificial rites, yet it is evident that they were not animated by the spirit of religious reverence: when most conscious of human feebleness, they seem not to have entertained any notion of being in the hands of a divinity, or divinities, whom they might propitiate by service and offer- ings, but to have given themselves up to the undefined appre- hension of an irresistible, blind fatality. The early Arab popu- lar poetry differs, therefore, widely in its spirit from that of most other nations in a corresponding stage of progress: for, in general, the nearer we approach to the fountains of national literature, the more distinctly do we see the powers of heaven reflected in that current of feeling which reveals itself in popular songs. Yet the ancient Arabs were not unimaginative-far otherwise, they were delicately sensitive to those impressions of natural phenomena from which mythologies have been wont to originate. Their hardy nomadic life, with its struggles and vicissitudes, was, perhaps, a bar to that meditative pondering on the appearances of nature which might have imparted to them a spiritual significance, making them emblems and manifestations of supernatural being. It may be, also, that what is here refer- red to had to do with a certain race-tendency to the abstract, in the conception of divine existence, which a distinguished orientalist,* whose way of dealing with the supposed fact I can- not accord with, thinks to have discovered among the Shemites -the individualizing of the notion of superhuman power hav- ing been thereby restricted. But what concerns us most is the presentation of evidence of the fact that the early Arabs were fatalists, not the explanation of it. Hear, then, Zuhair, in his Mu'allakah, saying :t "Fate, to me, is like a stumbling, eyeless camel- Whom it hits it kills, whom it misses lives and grows old;" and Tarafah, author of another of the seven poems, who says:: ,5(J?JL^ ^t j^ oi&amp;in j;;s Wr Ats y L&gt;-- *t s 4. 3 * Renan, in his Nouvelles Considerations sur le Caractere Gne6ral des Peuples S6mitiques, et en particulier sur leur Tendance au Monothbisme.

"0 whoever blames me for presence in the fight, And that I join in pleasures, canst thou make me immortal But, art thou powerless to repel my fate, Then leave me, 'ere it comes, to enjoy whatever I get." In a similar strain says Ka'b Bin Zuhair : "But if, 0 Juwaiy, thou perishest, So will all beings have their spoilers ;" and 'al-'Utbl :t (^J-LWz w ^&gt;LC ?J -as tL. IL^o JL6J P,3 cj lSO "My fate divided with me my sons, on shares, And, after its portion was used up, assailed mine."

How many a true brother to me Have I buried with my own hands, Nor sorrowed, nor bewailed, Seeing my weeping would not profit!" To these specimens belonging t ththe age before Muhammad may be added the following, from early post-islamic times, which breathe the same spirit. Says 'al-Huraith Bin Zaid 'al-Khail, of the time of 'Umar:Jj "But mourn not thou, O mother of Aus, For fate seizes as well the sandalled as the barefoot;" and Fatimah Bint 'al-'Ajham, said to have been a cousin of Mu- hammad :?[ \ ^Xi (J t Js? ^ _,A C ) LA L.

But there are other passages to be met with, in this later poetry, which indicate that the publication of the Kuran gave a new turn to the flight of the Arab muse, by leading it to the recog- nition of a personal Deity. For example, we find 'Abu-Khirash 'al-Hudhaili, contempo- rary with 'Umar, in an elegy on the death of a son slain in blood-revenge, expressing himself thus :l c(J^ OS 0 Sr ; Li7O, Ai l * C jt , xXJ LMM O- &gt; "Deprived of 'Urwah, I praise my God That Khirash is spared-one calamity is lighter than another;" and a sense of dependence on divine sovereignty is expressed by 'Abdah Bin 'at-Tablb, in a lament on the death of Kais Bin 'Asim, as follows :?

Let us now inquire into the teachings of the Kuran on the subject of divine sovereignty: first determining the signification of the root JO:, as used in the Kuran, from which comes ), the Muslim term for predestination; and afterwards citing other texts which relate to the sovereignty of God in general, or de- clare his sovereignty with reference, particularly, to human ac- tions. I will begin by bringing forward the few passages in which derivatives from ),-j are employed in other senses than as predicating any thing of the Deity, as follows : ii[xci]. 237, "the rich man is obligated for what he can command (z);,X), and the poor man for what is at his command (9j&amp;)"; ii [xci]. 266, " they have no sovereign control over (,cs co).j.

Xi)Ji );" x [lxxxiv]. 25, "and the people of the earth imagine that they have command of it (L4*1 o)3p[i);" xiii [xc]. 18, "he sends down water from heaven, so that water- courses flow to their utmost capacity (Lx).) ;" xvi [lxxiii]. 77, "a servant under a master, who has no disposing power over (cS4iiL M) any thing;" xxxiv[lxxxv]. 10, "saying: Make thou coats of mail, and use judgment (gi,) in the interchaining;" xxxiv [lxxxv]. 12, "and stationary basins (0) , lit. measures);" xlviii [cviii]. 21, "and other things which ye have not at com- mand (L4 . l):i 'J ), which God holds in his own hand;" lvii [xcix]. 29, "because they who are taught by written revelation [Jews and Christians] know not that it is not theirs to command any thing of the favor of God (Ail , or ,c' c4: o~-.. M);" lxviii [xvii]. 25, "and in the morning they went out with a de- termined purpose (..)pi' .&gt; 7 xi. ) ;" lxx [xlvii]. 4, "on a day the measure of which (zaA9I) will be fifty thousand years;" lxxiv [ii]. 18-20, " he considers and determines (px:)-so let him be slain! how does he determine (id.)?-and again, let him be slain! how does he determine (id.) ?" lxxvi [lii]. 16, "wine-jars of silver, of which they shall have absolute command (LsJ% * All our citations being from the Arabic text, the received order of the Surahs will be followed; but the number of each as chronologically determined by Rod- well (The Koran: Transl. . .

E. Salisbury, From these examples it would seem that the generic idea of X)j is to have disposing power. We will next pass in review all those passages of the Kuran in which any form derived from this root is used to express relations of the Deity to the world: ii [xci]. 19, "and if God had pleased, he would have taken away their hearing and their eyes-verlily, God is a supreme sovereign (,.

All these passages represent the Deity either as (1) having ab- solute disposing power, or (2) using sovereign discretion, or (3) fore-ordaining; and we here find not only the phenomena of the physical world, but also the destinies of men, and even human action and feeling (see xv [lvii]. 60, and lx [cx]. 7), subordinated to the divine control. We also see that Ljxi had already ac- quired the special sense of 'destiny predetermined by God' (see lxxvii [xxxvi]. 22). To complete this part of our investigation, it remains to take the testimony of those texts of the Kuran which declare divine sovereignty in other terms. I shall not attempt to exhaust this class of texts, but shall only bring forward some fair specimens of it, and especially those which speak of the sovereignty of God as involved in human action: ii [xci]. 99, " they who are infidels among the people favored with written revelations, and among the idolaters, like not that any favor should be bestowed by 115</page><page sequence="12">E.

E. Salisbury, the determinations of the Deity, in respect to human action, upon the foreseen issues of man's exercise of his moral liberty; and that man might cease to be free, by way of divine penalty for the misuse of freedom. But there are traditions which claim to give us Muhammad's teachings on this subject. All these, also, deserve to be con- sidered: for, if not found positively inconsistent with the Kuran, their universal acceptance by Muslims, as authentic, must carry our acknowledgment of them along with it; besides that, even if their authenticity be doubted, they still constitute a highly important chapter, and one hitherto unpublished out of the pale of Islam, of early Muslim speculation on this most interesting subject. I shall, therefore, cite these traditions here, in full, in the order and form in which they are embodied in the collec- tions of Bukhari and Muslim, omitting, however, the repetitions, by different lines of descent, in the same collection, as well as other traditions which vary from those cited only in trivial points, and bringing together the parallel traditions of the two authorities.* We will first introduce Bukhari's Chapter of Pre- destination ()yxS1 s y), beginning as follows: "We are told as a tradition by 'Abu-l-Walid HishIm Bin 'Abd-'al- Milik, that Shu'bah tells us, saying: Sulaiman 'al-'A'mash related to me the following: I heard Zaid Bin Wahb, on the authority of 'A4d- allah-to whom may God be gracious! say: The Messenger of God..., who is the True, the Trusted, gave the following to be handed down as a tradition, saying: 'Any one of you is made up in his mother's womb in the course of forty days, after which, for the same length of time, he is blood coagulated, and then, for the same time, a mass of flesh; afterwards, God sends an angel who is charged with four decrees, signi- fying his allotment of good, his moral conduct, his term of life, and whether he is to be one of the miserable or one of the blessed. There- fore, by God, any one of you (or, a man) may conduct himself as do those destined for Hell, until the distance between him and it is not two spans (or, an ell), and yet the registered decree shall prevent him, so that he shall conduct himself as do those destined for Paradise, and accord- ingly enter therein: and a man may even conduct himself as do those destined for Paradise, until the distance between him and it is not an ell (or, two ells), and yet the registered decree shall prevent him, so that he shall conduct himself as do those destined for Hell, and accordingly enter therein.'

Salisbury, be supposed that they would neglect the kernel in caring for the shell. What then do the foregoing traditions teach on the subject of predestination ? They declare that in the remote ages of eter- nity-"fifty thousand years" says one "before he created the heavens and the earth" (p. 145)-God passed certain unchange- able decrees in respect to all created things, including, for man, not only allotments of physical good and evil, and intellectual abilities, but determinations of moral conduct, and decisions as to destiny in the future world. Even wicked human conduct is represented as decreed by God: "God fore-ordains for the son of Adam his measure of lewdness-to that he attains without fail" (s. pp. 137-8); yet not so as to involve the denial of free- dom to do right, for, in the very traditions here alluded to, it is implied that the will has control over those indulgences of the emotional nature which constitute sin. As to the origin of human sinfulness, it is taught that all men are born "religiously constituted," or "religious," or "of this religion," i. e., in a condition of ability to conform to the religion which Muhammad claimed to be the true (p. 131); and this point is significantly illustrated by the saying: "like as ye take up the beast at its birth-do ye find upon it any mutila- tion, until ye yourselves mutilate it?" (p. 130, and comp. p. 131). Hereditary depravity, then, is denied. All departures from truth and rectitude are referred to parental instruction: "it is his parents who make him, afterwards, a Jew, or a Christian, or a Magian" (p. 132); and, also, to fierce besettings of Satan: "Every man whom his mother brings forth is buffeted on both sides by Satan" (ibid.)-Jesus and the Virgin Mary alone being exempted. Yet something of infirmity is recognized as pertain- ing to human nature, for men are said to stand in need of divine guidance, in order to right conduct (p. 144); and the'Prophet is reported to have declared, as " one of the treasures of Paradise :" "There is no power, nor strength, but through God" (p. 137), and again: "There is made to succeed no successor [in human descent] who has not two inclinations, one prompting him to good, and impelling him thereto, and the other prompting him to evil, and thereto impelling him; and he is secured whom God secures" (ibid.). Nor is the divine influence which man needs, in order to right doing, supposed to be limited to the arrange- ment of outward circumstances, for "All the hearts of the chil- dren of Adam, " said the Prophet, as reported, " are held between two fingers of the Merciful, as one heart, which he governs as he will" (s. p. 143). The old question of the moral condition of infants, however, is met by an implied denial of their having any positive moral character: "God best knows what would have been their conduct" [had they lived to maturity] (pp. 130-2); 148</page><page sequence="45">Muhammadan Predestination and Free lill. -which, according to one tradition, was said in immediate con- nection with the denial of hereditary depravity already referred to. There is an implied reservation of human liberty, also, in the manner in which is set forth the preventive power of the di- vine decrees respecting future destiny; for, while it is said that "God made both Paradise and Hell, and accordingly creates some persons for the one and some for the other" (p. 146), and even that "he guides by a predestination to misery as'well as to felicity, and like as cattle are led to their pastures" (p. 144)- (if these are words of Muhammad) it is likewise affirmed that "any one of you may even conduct himself as do those des- tined for Paradise, until there is only an ell between him and it; and yet the registered decree shall prevent him, so that he shall conduct himself as do those destined Jbr Hell, and accordingly enter therein: and any one of you may even conduct himself as do those destined for Hell, until the distance between him and it is only an ell; and yet the registered decree shall pre- vent him, so that he shall conduct himself as do those destined for Paradise, and accordingly enter therein" (p. 123). Again, that a man is not borne along by irresistible fatality to Heaven or to Hell, but is himself the prime procurer of his own future destiny, is explicitly taught: "There is no one of you," the Prophet is reported to have said-" there is no soul born whose place, whether Paradise or Hell, has not been predetermined by God, and which has not been registered beforehand as either miserable or blessed;" whereupon a certain man inquired: "O Messenger of God, shall we not, then, await our registered des- tiny, and let conduct alone?" to which the Prophet is said to have replied: "Whosoever is destined to felicity, will set him- self to the conduct of the blessed; and whosoever is destined to misery, will set himself to the conduct of the miserable. Work ye, seeing that every one is divinely furthered: as for those destined to felicity, they are furthered to the conduct of the blessed; and as for those destined to misery, they are furthered to the con- duct of the miserable" (p. 126); while, according to another tra- dition, it was said by the Prophet: "Every moral agent isfur- thered to his own conduct" (p. 128), or, as another has it: "Every one is divinely furthered in accordance with his character" (ibid.). On the other hand, the doctrine that character and conduct are not matters of contingency, but are included within the scope of the decrees of God, is equally well guarded. To the inquiry: " O Messenger of God, dost thou think that what men now do, and endeavor after, is something determined for them, and which a preventing predestination previously assigned to them? or are their actions casual incidents, consequent upon what their Prophet has announced to them, and their proved obligations ?"

Salzsbury, ten, and predetermined, that we should be so disposed as we are, at this time, touching present conduct? or, on the other hand, is our character a casual incident ?") the Prophet is reported to have replied: "Not so, but rather are the actions of men deter- mined for them, and previously assigned to them" (s. pp. 128-9). One tradition, indeed, reported by Bukhari and Muslim to- gether in several forms, respecting an imagined dispute between Adam and Moses, might seem to imply that divine predestina, tion excludes blameworthiness: "Said Moses: 0 Adam, it is thou, our father, who didst frustrate our destiny, and eject us from Paradise; to whom Adam replied: O Moses, thou art he whom God did specially favor with converse with himself, and for whom he traced lines of writing with his own hand-dost thou blame me for doing what God predestined for me forty years before he created me? Therefore Adam got the better of Moses in the dispute" (s. p. 139, and comp. pp. 140-1). But these words put into the mouth of our prime progenitor: " dost thou blame, etc." are an argumentum ad hominem, intended to silence one who fails to recognize the moral liberty of the race-comp. the expressions attributed to Moses: "didst frustrate our des- tiny," "didst spoil mankind of their rectitude" (p. 140), and "didst lay prostrate the race of man" (ibid.). The preceding remarks cover all the important theoretical part of Muhammad's teachings, reported by tradition, with re- spect to predestination. But there are embodied in the tradi- tions under review some practical principles, bearing upon the subject, which also claim our notice. A certain passiveness in regard to outward circumstances is enjoined as follows: " no mortal, being in a city where there is pestilence, who waits in the midst of it, not leaving the city, patient and collected, knowing that no evil will befall him but that which God fore-ordained for him-shall he not have a like reward with the martyr?" (p, 144); and again, when one of the Prophet's wives had prayed to God to spare her husband and her father, Muhammad is reported to have said: "Thou hast asked of God respecting terms of life already fixed, days numbered, and allotments portioned out-of which nought is to be anticipated, before its time, nor deferred thereafter; hadst thou asked of God to save thee from the punishment of Hell (or, from punishment in the grave) it would have been better (or, more meritorious)" (pp. 146-7); also, on another occasion, in re- ply to a message from one of his daughters, to inform him that her son was at the point of death, the Prophet is reported to have said: ' To God belongs both what he takes away and what he grants; every one has a fixed term of life; be thou, then, pa- tient, and consider" (p. 133). On the same ground, vowing to God is forbidden: "Vowing 150</page><page sequence="47">Muhammadan Predestination and Free Will. to God brings the son of Adam nothing which I have not fore- ordained, but turns him over to predestination for that which I have fore-ordained for him" (i. e., he gets it not for his vowing, but because it was fore-ordained for him)-" it is from an avari- cious being that one gets any thing by vows" (s. p. 136). Again, it is set forth as becoming the believer to seek profit by the "some good in every thing," asking help of God, and trusting in him, when ill befalls, with the injunction: "say not; Had it been my doing, it would have been so and so, but say: It is God's decree, and whatever he wills he does" (p. 142). It appears, then, from this review, that the doctrine of pre- destination which Muslim tradition ascribes to Muhammad, though more fully developed, indeed, than the teachings of the Kuran on the same subject, is entirely consistent with the latter; for while, on the one hand, we seem to find a system of absolute election and reprobation, there is a doctrine of human freedom unmistakably presented, on the other, compelling us to qualify the sharper assertions of divine predestination in harmony with it. We may add, in passing, that the language of tradition seems often to be a reflection, or even a repetition, of that used in the Kuran. It is also worthy of remark, with regard to the style of these traditions, that the concrete form of their doctrinal state- ments is fitted to encourage confidence in their being genuine, especially when one contrasts this mode of presentation with the abstract tenor of the discussions on the subject of predestination, and kindred topics, which arose in the schools of the Muslims, after Muhammad's generation had passed away. 3. In pursuance of the plan proposed, I shall now simply ex- cerpt what is to be found relating to predestination in Sliahras- tani's exposition of Muslim theologico-philosophical speculations, up to his time in the twelfth century. No such summary has been drawn up hitherto; and, indeed, Shahrastanf's Book of Re- ligious and Philosophical Sects, while perhaps the most import- ant original authority which we have, covering the whole field of Muslim philosophy, could be consulted, till of late, by only a few of those whom its statements especially concerned; and is now known, beyond the circle of professed orientalists, only by the German translation of Haarbriicker, which can be scarcely said to suffice for the reader to whom the original Arabic is not also intelligible. Some brief explanations will be thrown in, here and there, to make our author's meaning more clear, and some chronological data will be added ;* but I shall not attempt, * Our author's arrangement, which seems to be in chronological sequence, may serve to determine, approximately, the periods of some of the theologians named.

However inviting a field of research it may be, to ascertain the genesis of these speculations, I do not feel myself prepared to enter upon it in the way of original investigation; and even the latest writers on the Scho- lastic philosophy whom I have consulted, Haureau, Rousselot, and Ritter, offer but little assistance in such an inquiry. All these writers confine their remarks upon the philosophy of the Arabs, for the most part, to the various modifications of Aristote- lianism which grew up among them, to the neglect of the doc- trines of the KIuran; and it would, certainly, have been less to their purpose to inquire into those speculations by which disci- ples of Muhammad who professed to keep within the limits of re- ceived doctrine, sought to shape their religious belief to the re- quirements of widening philosophical culture. The same point of view is that chiefly taken by Munk and Renan, also, in their late valuable publications relative to Arab philosophy. The more simple statements of the Kuran, and those of the great collections of tradition, might have, also, led us to some interest- ing comparisons; for there is a striking similarity between the Kuranic doctrine of predestination and the Biblical, inasmuch as both enunciate the opposite truths involved, with equal boldness, and a seeming unconcern about their reconciliation; nor can it be doubted that the definitions thrown around the subject by Muslim tradition, imperfect as they are, savor much of what has been called the Greek anthropology.* But I could not well pursue even these more obvious lines of comparison. Muslim theologians, as Shahrastani informs us,t have differed among themselves on the following points: 1. the divine unity, 2. divine justice, 3. the promises and threatenings of God, 4. revelation, 5. human reason. The orthodox doctrine of divine justice is defined to be "that the Supreme God is just in his doings in the sense that he exer- cises sovereign discretion in his kingdom and dominion, doing what he wills, and ordaining as he pleases ( .Lo Q , ~I ..j.. L o - lL.. Lo . . K L): for justice," it is said, "consists in putting things in their right places, which is sovereignty of control in accordance with the promptings of choice and the requisitions of knowledge, while injustice is the opposite; so that no iniquity in ordaining, or injustice in disposing, is to be imag- ined as pertaining to God"-in short, that the character of God * s.

The Separatists, on the other hand, defined justice to be "conformity to the dictates of reason with regard to what is wise (4J.tI o-, jiJ Saj ..i Lo), that is, the governing of action by the standard of rectitude and utility." Such is the funda- mental difference of system which we shall find carried out in the speculations to be brought forward, touching the relations of God to the world. Accordingly, as to the third point, those reputed orthodox de- nied that there is any ground in the nature of things for the divine threatenings and promises, or for the divine commands and prohibitions; but resolved both into "an eternal fiat of God ( &amp;j'Jlt a? ), so that every one who is saved, and partakes, as he must, of reward, is saved by virtue of divine promise (aXs.); and every one who is lost, and partakes, as he must, of penalty, is lost by virtue of divine threatening (sX^^ej); and accordingly nothing befalls any one by a necessity arising from the require- ments of reason (JitJZl ^^ cr * . . S .. SA)." But the Sep- aratists affirmed that there is no such eternal fiat, and that all the divine commands and prohibitions, promises and threaten- ings, are contingent (cX A.), "so that whoever is saved merits reward for his conduct, and whoever is lost merits pen- alty for the same; and that reason, having respect to what is wise, requires these allotments (J ..... i.2&lt; - 4 , Jl)."4 Tradition shows, as we have already learned, that in the minds of the followers of Muhammad, in his own day, there was a conflict between the sense of human responsibility and belief in divine sovereignty; and we have also seen that the teachings of the Kuran left open the way to just that opposition of views which is brought out by Shahrastani in the statements here referred to. But we learn from our author, more particu- larly,* that "in the latter days of the Companions of the Prophet arose the new doctrine of Ma'bad 'aj-Juhanl, Ghailan 'ad-Dimashki and Yiunus 'al-'AswAri, consisting in the mainten- ance of human ability, and a denial of all relation of moral good and evil to divine predestination (K'SL )Lu W iL J. % Jt 3 OWSt jlt 'l J.t);" and that their views were further devel- oped by Wasil Bin 'Ata' 'al-Ghazzal and his pupil 'Amru Bin 'Ubaid ;t but that Wisil and his followers were the first to be * pp. 17-18 as above. t Who both lived in the first half of the eighth century: s. p. 155, and Ibn Khal- lik., ed.

At a later period, "some of the masters of the Mu'tazilah gave themselves to the diligent reading of the works of the Philosophers,* when translated in the days of 'al-Ma'mun [in the early part of the ninth century], and so incorporated their methods with their own, and formed a special branch of science under the name of 'al-Kalam," that is, the Science of the Divine Word, or dogmatic theology.t We have now to follow the details of our author respecting the doctrines of the Mu'tazilah, and of the several subordinate sects included under that name, so far as they bear upon the subject of predestination. First, then, from his specification of some points on which all the Mu'tazilah concurred, we derive the following particulars.: It was an opinion common to them all, that "eternity is the dis- tinguishing attribute of the Divine Being;" and they all denied the existence of eternal divine qualities, on the ground that, being eternal, they could only be conceived of as so many sepa- rate divinities. Their language on this point was that God "is knowing by virtue of his being, powerful by virtue of his being, living by virtue of his being-not by knowledge, power, and life as eternal qualities, and ideas subsistent in him (J0' ^;'tJ .y&lt; sj -S ^Lx/o ^L, M ^\s A Oz s i^^; s^ Y+ M tJ 's&gt; z' 'lJ). In like manner, "they all denied that willing, hearing, and see- ing are ideas subsistent in the Divine Being, though differing as to the modes of their existence, and their metaphysical grounds." "They also agreed in believing that man is the creative effi- cient of his actions, good and bad (aJL~ .J[L ).&gt;lJ x.Jl ot L,? B.-.&gt;), and gets reward and punishment in the future world, by merit, for what he does; and that no moral evil or iniquity, or action of unbelief or disobedience, can be referred to God, because, if he has caused unrighteousness to be, he is himself unrighteous (.U ,.[ JJl3 'ili&gt;-J J), "They all believed, also, that the All-wise does only that which is beneficial and good (j..S zr J$i i), and that a regard to the interests of men (OLJi 9- L?.), in the light of wisdom, is incumbent upon him; though they differed as to his being ob- ligated to secure the highest good, and to bestow grace (kJ3't L1? * i. e., the works of Greek philosophers, chiefly of the school of Aristotle; those of the Muslims who gave themselyes up to the. methods and views of that school were consequently called Philosophers, and we shall find the name frequently used in this sense. + Munk, in his Melanges de Philos.

Of what our author savs of the doctrines of the several sects of the Mu'tazilah, the following statements are to our purpose.* "The Wdsilyah--followers of 'Abu HIudhaifah Wiasil Bin 'Ata' 'al-Ghazzal, a pupil of 'al-Hasan of Basrah ... both of whom lived in the days of 'Abd-'al-Malik and Hisham Bin 'Abd- 'al-Malik [A.D. 684-743]. In the West, at the present time, there is a small remnant of them.... Their separatism turns upon four fundamental points: 1. The denial of knowledge, power, will, and life as qualities of the Creator." ... Wasil took up this doctrine on the ground that all men recognize "the absurdity of the existence of two [or more] eternal, infinite divinities, ... but it was only after study of the works of the Philosophers that his followers came to entertain it. Their speculations on the subject led them, at length, to reduce all divine qualities to the fact that God is knowing and powerful (tI)s l. J a, J. ), and afterwards to determine that knowledge and power are qualities of the na- ture of essence (cLxj;..'o c(.io), which are to be accounted as going to make up the eternal essence (..o:4Jt tAXJJ o l.c L)- according to the expression of 'aj-Jubba'i,t or states (WLjL)- according to that of 'Abuf Hashim ;4 while 'Abu-l-Husain of Bas- rah? was inclined to reduce the two to one, namely, the quality of a knowing being (i.LxS.ti), which is precisely the teaching of the Philosophers." ... 2. Their way of maintaining predestina- tion. " On this point, Wasil only followed in the steps of Ma'bad 'aj-Juhani and Ghailan 'ad-Dimashki, though he made more of it than of his doctrine with respect to the divine qualities. Accord- ingly, he said that the Creator is wise and just, and that it is inad- missible to refer evil and iniquity to him; that it cannot be that he prefers on the part of men the opposite of what he commands, and that, having ordained what their conduct should be, he after- wards recompenses them for the same: so that man is the doer both of good and evil, and therefore faith and unbelief, obedi- ence and disobedience, are his own acts; and he is recompensed for what he himself does; and the Lord has put all acts and their issues within the scope of man's power (a L ?3L (ta x?J). ... He also said that it were absurd for a man to be told to do any thing, if he is unable to do it ( J bl. .. o!t . . j X l a.

Wasil "referred that term of tradition 'predestination' to trial and deliverance, adversity- and prosperity, sickness and health, death and life, and other doings of God, exclusive of moral good and evil, virtue and vice, regarding men as responsible for the latter ( -.

'Abu-l-Hudhail "held to ten fun- damental points which were his own: 1. That the Creator is a knowing being by virtue of knowledge, but that his knowledge is his essence; powerful by virtue of power, but that his power is his essence; living by virtue of life, but that his life is his essence"--a view adopted from the Philosophers, who held that the divine essence is strictly one, and that its qualities are not separate therefrom, and subsistent in it, but constitute that essence itself. ...

That the fiat of God "is partly without any subject in which it inheres, to wit, his command to be, and partly inherent in a subject, as, for instance, an injunction or a prohibition, an announcement or an interrogation;" and he distinguished between " the creative mandate ( i.^-J ,?A) and the order imposing obligation ( '..Jil4f )." 4. That in his present state of being man possesses a determining power of will, but that " in the states of final retribution all human move- ments are ruled by necessity, men having no power over them, and all of them being generated by the Creator (5 'y..)?, LS (5).l '_JL^ L., 4*1s L.JJIx sXi): because, if within the power of men, they would be laid upon them as duties to be performed (L. ..'JL tjA Il. x.J " .3W L.l JK .J 3I) [and so men would be again under probation]." ... 6. That "free will ('Ullw&gt;S) is an accident ('c.), additional to perfection of development ('ALJ$l) and soundness ( 'HS)."

He taught, moreover, that " whatever is brought about through the medium of action on the part of man (6x.JI j or (J.' Lo) is his doing, except [the perceptions of] color, taste, smell, and the like, which are inex- plicable," and excepting also all comprehension and knowledge obtained in the way of instruction, which he regarded not as the learner's work, but as called into being by God (,jLxi ' l oL.J J3Lxt oAr L J... , L^ .A). ... 8. That a certain time is defi- nitely fixed for the termination of a man's life, "unless he dies by violence (Ji..

As 'al-Ka'bi* reports, that "God's willing is something distinct from that which is willed: for his willing of that which he creates is his creation thereof, but his creation of a thing is not the thing itself-nay, according to him, creation is a fiat without any subject in which it inheres [being divine essence itself]t (&lt; U' t. - j'l' JILt ;i ; A '&gt;Y , J^s? ^ S ^s ? ?JjL sjijl^ 33 f^\ -us ?? ^JL^ &amp; dJ &amp;SJL&gt;). ...

He maintained that God must needs be wholly clear of that which is vicious, and that, "therefore, the Doer of Righteousness is possessed of no ability in respect to unrighteousness ('\xJ xJ.. ,Y SjS. Lr. LxJLo N( ) j.&gt; 1"W okJ)." To this view of the power of choice (^[';..) in the Divine Being he added that, as regards things of the present life, God "has power only to do that which he knows will bene- fit his creatures (a&amp;L).J l 4.x L fo .W \ .) cXA.i L..1)," and that he has no power to increase or diminish the penalties of the future world, or to diminish its rewards. It was urged against him as an unavoidable inference from these positions, that God must be regarded as subject to a natural necessity (c:,a), and controled by a superior force (t).), in what he does, "for that he only who can choose between doing and not doing is truly pos- sessed of power (S;I JIl J Lr , '...". I . r 5ii ( ,I, )" -which he retorted by saying that those who affirm God to be capable of misdeeds, and yet that his doing evil would be an ab- surdity, equally restrict his freedom. He borrowed these views from the ancient Philosophers, who maintained that God has no reserved power, but that what he actually originates and causes to be is the measure of his ability ()Xi't _ -. .., i.A 4l). ... 2. He denied that God exercises volition in any proper sense: "for, if he be said to govern his own actions by volition, the meaning is that he causes them to be, and originates them, in accordance with what he knows (o,t1 Al%J[ t~l i. , LyJ :a3 36j L, o0 c~^ [:; l. % I /iI L iA l .JXSt J); and if he be said to will human actions, the meaning is that he commands those actions (Le ol &amp;i - L$it M L.[ tljy. ~Lh3 .., ). tuj I)."... 4. Respecting the human constitution, he taught, with the Phi- losophers, that "the essential constituents of man are soul and mind, together with body as the instrument and mould of sensibil- ity and intellect (4^ 1 .;xJJ i 0JVs L9 - ' " i );" .. but "that mind is a subtle matter ( ' (f), involved in the body, which enters with its particles into that mould, as watery quality enters into the rose, oily quality into sesamum, and fatty quality into milk." The distinguishing prerogatives of mind, in his view, are force (y),* free will ('XLL[.I), life (i .), and choice (4-.s); mind " has free will in and of itself, and all action presupposes it ().Jlt L. x.l:x, L[ .

Here too he borrowed from the Philosophers .... 12, He held that, without a revelation, man is capable, by reflection, of re- cognizing the Creator, and of distinguishing between virtue and vice, ..." and he said that, in order to a genuine power of choice, there must needs be two suggestions, one bidding to go forward, and the other to hold back (rl;JLuYL Sf . ,..l .o X .

His saying that free will consists in corporeal wholeness, and entire soundness of limbs (Q. L'L6 I wls'I r ..^ .

That, as is stated by 'al-Ka'bi, " he spoke of God's exercise of volition as an act of his in a two-fold rela- tion (CA . - () J ,, x L-jl' (L3ai Ab 3 )I), being both a qualification of essence (lA3o "o) and a qualification of action (Ji KA"): a qualification of essence-for God is perpetually will- ing all his own actions and all the obediences of his creatures, since he is all-wise, and the All-wise cannot know what is beneficial and good without willing it; and a qualification of action-for he thereby wills his own doing, at the instant of its actualization (. a3l ,. 3L=s), so that his exercise of volition is [virtually] a creation thereof, though prior to [actual] creation, because that whereby a thing is cannot be contemporaneous therewith; and thereby, also, wills the doings of his creatures, which amounts to commanding those doings. 5. His saying that there is a [measure of] di- vine grace of which the bestowment would secure such conver- sion of all mankind to the faith that they would merit the same reward as if they had believed without that grace, and even more (U',.t o^tL, C C 7 MY n ^\ ^ A!

"The Mu'ammariyah-followers of Mu'ammar Bin 'Abbad 'as-Sulami, who went beyond all other advocates of human ability ('..ti tJ=t . P3) in subtleties against the reality of the divine attributes, and of predestination of moral good and evil by God. . Among the particulars in which he differed from others of his denomination are the following: '1. That God creates noth- ing except bodies (~L'&gt;J), so that accidents (ti35t) are devel- opments from bodies ((L^. I s;'x&gt;i), either by a natural ne- cessity (Lx*.)-as in the case of fire, which originates burning, and the sun, which originates warmth, and the moon, which originates color-or conditioned by the power of choice (I,L.t), as in the case of an animal, which originates motion and rest, .copulation and separation; and both the coming into existence of body and its ceasing to be (slW' ~.I J ..) are, in his view, also accidents-strangely, indeed, for how could he say that either the one or the other is through the action of body itself? moreover, on the principle that the Creator originates no accident, he originates neither the existence of body nor its destruction, because its existence [as well as destruction] is an accident; from which it follows, by unavoidable infer- ence, that no activity at all pertains to God. .. 2. That acci- dents are permanent in the several species of things to which they belong ( J vL L'j' Y), and that every accident sub- sists in a subject, though its subsistence therein is only by vir- tue of some idea [of the human mind] which requires it (uq J fil.Jt . .. I ; X i , . . j)--which results in the fallacy of the circle." On the ground of this view of acci- dents as only ideally subsistent Mu'ammar and his followers were called Idealists (itt .L Il) . ... 3. "As 'al-Ka'bi re- ports, that God's willing of any thing is neither God himself -that is, divine essence], nor the creation of that thing by aim, nor an ordering of it, nor an announcement thereof, nor a judgment respecting it-intimating some unknown and in- comprehensible thing. He likewise held that to man pertains no activity except that of will ( 'Jt f S_ o, L. tu uJ), either directly causative (L-S:.) or acting through generative action from without (l-..i); and that all actions which are made obligatory upon him ... resolve themselves into the exer- cise of volition on his part ('-lt ,Jt s. l.4)" , ,-which s, p. 159. 162</page><page sequence="59">Muhammadan Predestination and Free WVill. finds its explanation in his doctrine with respect to what truly constitutes man, namely, that he is "an idea,* or a substance, without body (&lt; Ai. ?# . . L ,A), which knows, has ability, chooses, and discerns, while it neither moves nor rests, nor takes color, nor occupies place, nor is either seen or felt or touched, nor takes one position instead of another, nor is embraced by space or limited by time, but, on the other hand, is itself the regent of the body (&lt;,_~J! jc); and that his association with the corporeal is an association of regulation and disposal"-a view which he borrowed from the Philosophers ... 4. He is reported to have denied the eternity of God... and to have said " that God knows [only] of priority [of existence] in time (J.ij-l L, itJUS )," .. . and to have insisted upon distinguish- ing between creation and the thing created, and between pro- duction and the thing produced [making God not answerable for the latter]; "and Ja'far Bin Harb reports that he affirmed it to be absurd that God should know himself, because that would lead to the confounding of subject and object of knowl- edge; and absurd that he should know things which are apart from himself, just as his having the sovereign disposal of all existing things is held to be absurd, inasmuch as he himself is an existence. But perhaps this statement is erroneous, ... so that what 'Ibn 'Abbad maintained was that it should not be said that God knows himself, because that would lead to a dis- tinction between [God as] the knowing and [God as] the known; nor that he knows things which are apart from himself, because that would imply a knowledge dependent upon what is external to himself, of derived origin." ... "The Muzddriyah- followers of lsa Bin Sabih, called 'AbA Musa, and distinguished by the epithet of 'al-Muzdar, a disciple of Bishr Bin 'al-Mu'tamir... who lived a life of devout seclu- sion, and bore the name of Monk of the Mu'tazilah. He dif- fered from others of his party in several particulars:" 1. He said "with respect to power (,)&amp;ill), that God might ()xi.) lie and be unjust, and that, were he so to do, he would be a lying, unrighteous deity-[in other words, that the same criterion of right and wrong which applies to man, both as regards power to do either, and the putting forth of that power in act, is ap- plicable to God].... 2. As to generative action upon man from without ( btJ.t), he professed the same doctrine as his master, adding thereto that, by virtue of such generation, one and the same action may proceed from two agents (^ '. -. l xJ.w L c,.. x..S d. X, )" . but "he regarded as infidels those who say that the conduct of men is created by God (Jr xJez .LAJI 3.l s )." ... * Probably, in the sense of the Platonic emanation-system. 163</page><page sequence="60">E. E. Salisbury, " The Thumdmiyah-followers of Thumamah Bin 'Ashras 'an- Numairi, a man of slender faith in religion, and dissolute char- acter. ... Among his peculiarities of doctrine were the follow- ing: 1. That actions produced by generation from without (sOiX I 3JzLx&gt;S) are actions of no agent: since one may not refer them to that generative agency by which their causes exist,* thereby involving, by necessary inference, that such action may be owing to the operation of a cause without life, as when a cause acts and dies, and the product of its generative action comes into existence subsequently (JPI ' ,?l.. U l'; &gt; -.A SI L...; a . oLo~ :. Jiwr3j 15 L . L .o .L ); and since they are not referable to God, because such reference might lead to imputing to him what is vicious, which is absurd. ... 2. That infidels, idolaters, Magians, Jews, Christians, Dual- ists, and Deniers of Immortality, will be turned to dust at the resurrection; and in like manner, beasts, birds, and the infants of believers. 3. That free will ( 'Lh:wJ) consists in com- pleteness and entire soundness of the members of the body, and is a pre-requisite to all action (JXi S. ) ... 6. That man is an agent only in volition (sj) CS o)Ll 3a Jt ' ), and that whatever exceeds the province of the will [in human action] originates without an originator (J 'M_ 0 ^ ' .. s kLXC ,0)." Furthermore, 'Ibn 'ar-Rawandi states as the opinion of Thuma- mah, that "the world is God's work by virtue of his nature (&amp;cL. . L.j ,JL il sj3 LxI), meaning thereby, perhaps, what the Philosophers mean when they speak of a necessity of being (vJW . L...'3), in contradistinction to production in accordance with volition," which involves the idea of the eternity of the world, "since a necessary result is implied by a necessitating cause (,X&gt;zy- s .A~ M d.y IC). Thumamah lived in the days of 'al-Ma'mun, and was a man of position in his court." "The Hishdmiyah-followers of Hisham Bin 'Amrn 'al-Futi, who went to a further extreme than others of the Mu'tazilah in the assertion of human ability, refusing to admit of any sort of reference of certain actions to the Creator (?Ubll cr, _. &gt;i, 5).L.Jl .J ,Slx.t s1j.), even though Revelation attributes them to him;" and saying "that God does not unite the hearts of be- lievers, but that believers come together by their own power of choice ().Ll), notwithstanding the Revealed Book declares: 'thou wouldst not have joined their hearts in friendship; but God hath united them ;'t and that God makes not believers to love *~~~~~ s. p. 160.I ~ KVur vi~iCi. 64-s. p.I~~ 118.

Another of the doctrines which he originated was "the denial that acci- dents prove God to be a creator, or are valid as proofs [of any thing], while he asserted, on the other hand, that bodies do prove a divine creator (S3 L:J0l zS 's xi; 3 o?i t elX = J UilaJLs 4 . cF jS.3u SL ^ J.$ oS u^^l~ JLai?)." .. He held also that, though a man should have obeyed God all his life long, a foreknowledge on the part of God that he would have annulled his good deeds by some great crime [if he had lived longer] would be sufficient ground for his forfeiting re- ward; and the same, on the reverse supposition. A follower of his, the Mu'tazilite 'Abbad, "abjured altogether the doctrine that God is the creator of an infidel, inasmuch as the infidel is made up of infidelity and man, and God does not create infidelity."... 'Al-Ffuti held, moreover, "that things, before they exist, are nonentities, and not things, though, after they have ceased to exist, they may still be called things (.LAt lT wj' J.&gt; &gt;C ^X- el ,I L cX r .. t .l. J..

"The Jdhiziyah-followers of 'Amru Bin Bahr 'aj-Jaliiz, one of the most eminent men among the Mu'tazilah, and their prin- cipal author, who, after having devoted himself to the study of many books of the Philosophers, made out a system of eclecti- cism, to which he gave currency by the aptness of his exposition and the beauty of his finished eloquence. He lived in the days of 'al-Mu'tasim and 'al-Mutawakkil [A.D. 833-61]."'l The fol- lowing are some of the peculiarities of his doctrine: 1. He held "that all cognitions have a necessity of nature (L4 OLt4 $t * Kur., xlix. 7. t Kur., ii. 6--s. p. 117. t Kur., iv. 164-s. p. 120: Fliigel's text reads l.. UJ1 .-. ?

It is even handed down that he denied the originality of volition, and its constituting a distinct genus among accidents (J.1i -ri &amp;; .Lc-Y 'r LU . L5J.3 aj)'l), saying that, when an agent is rid of the state of inertia, and comes to know what be is going to dO, he is, then, in the true sense a being who wills (jJ+ ( 'l ?31i t oso:i i . y [. l e. l;, LJC'3 ,ltt Chsat); and that, as to volition connected with the action of others, that is [merely] an inclination of feeling towards it (r.it YJa " i.lti: tw)"Jt lIo .S. &amp; ~it ,y.). To these views he added the assertion of innate tendencies pertaining to bodies, in accordance with the doctrine of the naturalistic school of Philosophers, and affirmed that different bodies have their appropriate actions. He also held it to be absurd that substances should be non-existent, and consequently regarded accidents as the variable element of ex- istence, while substance is necessarily permanent, .. He agreed with the Philosophers as regards the denial of the divine attri- butes, and, in conformity with the system of the Mu1tazilah, affirmed that man has the determining power over moral good and evil (Ax.I r3 ? . ,&gt; -, x3S); and 'al-Ka^i relates that he said, that the exercise of volition is attributed to the Creator in the sense that inertia and ignorance respecting his own actions are inconsistent with the idea of God, and that he can not be over-ruled and defeated [as to his own acts] (5JLi )lU. .w. f \^^' Y3 ~j^-^ Y3 allrjLxsi ^s ,.J _* ?; I oy L^. ^^.f^ ^J "The Khaydtyah - followers of 'Abu--lHusain Bin 'Abi 'Amrui 'al-Khaiyat, the teacher of 'Abu-l-Kisim Bin Muhammad 'al-Ka'bi, both of whom were of the Mu'tazilah of Baghdad, and held to one and the same system of opinions, only that 'al-Khai- yt. went to great lengths in affirming that what is non-existent is a thing ( .. :J,I '. .

Respecting the denial of the attributes of the Creator, as well as in respect to human ability ... he was of the same mind with all other Mu'tazilah. "'Al-Ka'bi deviated from his teacher in several particulars: 1. That volition as pertaining to the Creator is not a quality sub- sistent in his essence (&amp;j'I a liL o iJ lxj' )l oJ), that he does not exercise volition by virtue of being what he is ('x J -..j$ '3); and yet that it is not any thing contingent (';i. ('oI)) 53), either originating in [the divine essence as] a subject ( Ls' .S), or without inherence in a subject (, . . M); but that, when it is affirmed of him, in general, that he exer- cises volition, the meaning is [simply] that he is knowing and powerful, and neither is compelled nor resists opposing force, in his doings (~) M . 3 x as * ; ? )li, 1 ,c a . L); moreover, when he is said to will his actions, that the meaning is that he originates them agreeably to his own knowledge ( J Lte^S I s:. ~d:3 Lc L: J .L. a3l 6 ti l diLx Ay..); and, when it is said that he wills actions of his creatures, that the meaning is that he commands them, and takes complacency in them (ol Lc (L, L^ pt at 3). .. "The Jubbd'?yah and the Bahshamiyah- followers of 'Abu 'All Muhammad Bin 'Abd-'al-Wahhab 'aj-Jubba'f and his son 'Abil Hashim 'Abd-'as-Salam,* who were both of the Mu'tazilah of Basrah, and differed from their fellow-theologians, as well as from one another, in certain particulars. Among the points on which they both differed from others of their party are the following: 1. That they firmly believed in contingent volitions, not inherent in [the divine essence as] a subject, by virtue of which the Crea- tor is spoken of as a being who wills (} , M ' ls l)l I L:. t Ic.. Iyj~.9 4L czi,' QL.I o ..'): that there is a magnifying of himself [in volition] not inherent in [the divine essence as] a subject, when he wills to magnify his own being; and a vanish- ing away [in volition], not inherent in [the divine essence as] a subject, when he wills that the world should vanish away ('-^;,^ and that the speciality of qualification expressed by these [ and that the speciality of qtalification expressed by these [seve- ral] attributes [commonly ascribed to God] constitutes the Deity, without his being inherent in a subject (oi:aJ1t ws&amp; 1 JLo-31 tj . , .3 M l .. 3Js,i: , .. OY . . ). But to affirm that whatever existences are accidences, or to be judged of as acci- dences, are without a subject (4( 3, -otI . o,..yo ol.lI * s. p. 155, notes f, :. 167 VOL. VIII. 22</page><page sequence="64">RE E. Salisbury, L4J S' MS Llf), is like affirming that whatever existences are substances, or to be judged of as substances, are without place, and is akin to the doctrine of the Philosophers, inasmuch as they hold that there exists a certain [primordial] Reason which is a substance without subject and without place, and the like of the Universal Soul and the Immaterial Intelligences." ... 3. That "they agreed ... in affirming that action pertains to man, in the way of origination and first production (iQj 51 :cl&gt;.J liiJ: .L z lXJ iL:.l); and in ascribing moral good and evil, obedience and disobedience, to him, in the way of sove- reignty and prerogative (&amp;Jl 'I 'LLJi j-J.i I .. ' LI i.X&gt;t%.' ~Al"Vw?); and that free will (LIti,w ) is a pre-requi- site to action, and a power additional to bodily completeness and soundness of the members. Both also affirmed that corpo- real structure is a condition of subsistence to the ideas which are essentially involved in [human] life (rL^. . Lb " ' i. I';t si L.:. 2 -J' &lt;3 . tl lj*l-t I) ... 5. Both were also of opin- ion, that God withholds from his creatures nothing which he knows would lead them to obedience and self-consecration, if he were to do it for them, of that which is beneficial, or most advan- tageous, or gracious assistance (aol. A : y - . fJS i NJ' oI "iaJlJ); ... and that one may not say that God has power to do any thing more advantageous than what he actually does for his creature (z.u xts LI*. . .. eJ 3 SLxjt.ji ~d\); and that all convictions of duty are gracious gifts." ... As to points wherein they disagreed: 1. " Respecting the at- tributes of the Creator, 'aj-Jubba'i maintained that the Creator is knowing by virtue of his being, and powerful and living by virtue of his being; and this expression 'by virtue of his being (l'IJX)' meant, with him, that he did not define the fact of God's knowing by ascribing to him the quality of knowledge, or any state of existence by which his having knowledge is neces- sitated (LS 1- ,I , E "? aj :;i L,L &amp;j X'iW y. &amp;c l : &gt;O .. ..): whereas, in the view of 'Abu Hashim, God is knowing 'by virtue of his being,' in the sense that there pertains to him a certain state of existence which constitutes a qualification distinguishable from his being an existing essence (I&gt;..o j~' b1i std. KL3 '_ "L- ' . l 3 ^ .), and yet known only as conditioned by the divine essence, not as sepa- rate therefrom (o^l.jl M' u i = iI. d piJ' j i).... Abf Hashir said that human reason discovers a necessary distinction 168</page><page sequence="65">Muhammadan Predestination and Free Will. between the knowledge of a thing, in general, and the knowl- edge of it as respects a certain quality ( .b.)z? "i 5 . dJ&amp; " &amp; s &amp;.. i L t ' iA 4 C ^ ); so that one who takes cognizance of the divine essence does not [thereby] recognize it as a knowing essence, any more than one who takes cognizance of substance [thereby] knows it to be something extended, receptive of accident; and that mankind undoubtedly perceive an agreement of existences in one respect, and a disagreement in another, and must know that what they agree in is differ- ent from that in which they disagree; and that no rational being denies the reality of these differences determined by the reason; and that they are not reducible to [simple] essence, or to accidents independent of essence-which latter supposi- tion would lead to tlhe notion that accident subsists in accident. It is therefore made out, [he said,] by necessary inference, that they are states (J3S L[ . ); so that [for example] the knowledge of the Omniscient is a state, constituting a qualification inde- pendent of his being an essence (st, "i ,Z 3L li: (JlWxI o2&lt; Ij' L_ 3 )-that is to say, the mental conception of the quality is distinct from that which is formed of the divine essence (r..It tl i -J ' oi r('I# ' L4)-and the same may be said of his power and life; and, in addition to this, he affirmed as pertaining to the Creator another [generic] state, by which these [special] states are necessitated. His father, as well as all who denied the reality of [these] states, disputed his reasoning, and reduced the agreement and diversity [of existences] to mere words, and generic names (L.t .s-L J. '6Jt .c!): they said that states do not agree in being states, and disagree in certain specialities, and that so it is with respect to divine qualities; and that, otherwise, one is driven to affirm one state as belonging to another, and corm- mits the fallacy of the circle.... 3. The two were also at variance with each other in respect to certain questions per- taining to the subject of divine grace. Supposing the case of a person about whom the Creator should know that, were he to believe with the aid of grace, his reward would be less, on account of the lightness of his task, and that, were he to believe without grace, his reward would be greater, on account of the greatness of the toil which he would go through, 'aj-Jubba'i said that it would not be right for the Creator to lay duty upon him, without bestowing grace; and he made no distinction be- tween the case of such a person and that of one of whom it should be known that he would render no obedience to God, at all, except with the aid of grace; and said that, if God should impose obligation, without supplying grace, he would neces- sarily take advantage of one's condition of infirmity, and not 169</page><page sequence="66">E. E. Salisbury, [as he might] do away with it ( . jl ,~ t, y o . .3. Xal;d w .j ,s~ dls t v:o .. o J). But 'Abu Hashim dif- fered from 'aj-Jubb'i as to some of the points involved in this case: he said that it would be right for God to require belief under the more arduous condition, without grace. 4. They differed, furthermore, with regard to the infliction of pain by way of retribution, 'aj.Jubba'i saying that it may be inflicted, retributively, by anticipation (uc L - Xt X x jS JJ3.^.), and basing thereon the pain suffered by infants; whereas his son said that it would not be right that infants should suffer,' if their suffering were not retrospectively retributive (?J,&lt;o 3 s L. t "Both 'aj-Jubba'i and his son maintained that God would not be bound to do any thing for his creatures in this life [to help them to obedience], if he had not prescribed for them their duty, either through the medium of human reason or by positive law; but that, on the other hand, since he has made it obligatory upon them, in the apprehension of their own rational faculties, to do what is required [in the revealed law], and to avoid vicious ac- tions, and since he has, at the same time, given to them by crea- tion a passion for that which is vicious, and an aversion to that which is virtuous (&lt;$l o j_I .'ye ~ I *e .: L), and made them to have all blameable natural dispositions, it is incumbent upon him, while thus prescribing duty, to perfect [the exercise of] human reason, to suggest arguments, to come to the support of human ability and free will (8Sji!i 'Z3JS ..33 ' l!JMi2 ), and to provide means [of moral culture], so that he may do away with their weakness in respect to his commands; and that he is bound to do for them whatever is most likely to lead them to the performance of the duties imposed upon them by him, and to deter them from that vicious conduct which he has forbidden to them. . . "' The later Mu'tazilah, such as the Kx.hi 'Abd-'aj-Jabbar and others, pursued the path marked out by 'Abi Hashim. But 'Abu-l-Husain of Basrah set himself in opposition, and, having critically examined the arguments of his masters, went so far as to charge them with unreliable and futile reasoning, and took up other views on several points: as, for example, that he denied the reality of state (32l-),* and that the non-existent is a thing; ... and affirmed that existences are distinguished from one an- other in essence (4?L. . jlt 4-it o,l)--which followed from the denial of state; and that he reduced all the divine * s. p. 169. 170</page><page sequence="67">Muhammadan Predestination and Free Will. attributes to the fact that the Creator is knowing, powerful, and all-embracing. He also leaned to the doctrine of HishAm Bill 'al-Hakam, that things, before their existence, can not be known. He was, in fact, a Philosopher in his views, only that he passed off his opinions upon the Mu'tazilah by clothing them in the garb of dogmatic theology." . With these statements we come to the end of what Shahras- tgni informs us of the opinions of the Mu'tazilah, bearing upon the subject of predestination. It remains to collect from our author the views entertained on this subject by parties opposed to the Mu'tazilah, and to all those who held to a determining power of the will.* "The Jabariyah ('.4t lit. Absolutists). The doctrine of absolutism is the denial that man is really responsible for action, and attributing human action to the Lord as its author (.i8 JliX S: t &amp; sL ;i;A tAJ . - . Jr ^j). There are, however, some shades of difference among those who hold this doctrine: for we have the Unmixed Jabariyah, who do not maintain that either action or ability to act belongs, in any sense, to man (X~I JxlI 1s Y,i x cX .JJ . '' '); and the Moderate Jabariyah, who hold that man has an ability which is not at all efficacious (lol s'&gt;o' s " ~.~U - .'x ' ). But whoever affirms that created ability has any efficaciousness in respect to action, and calls that an appropriation (LY..),t is no maintainer of absolute sovereignty on the part of God (j 5j-..); although the Mu'tazilah call by the name of Jabariyah all those who do not maintain that created ability has sovereign efficacy, in the way of origination and first production of ac- tion; and they ought, in order to be consistent, to call by the same name those of their own party who say that actions generated by influence upon man from without are referable to no doer,4 inasmuch as such actions are held by them to be pro- duced independently of any efficaciousness of created ability." . . . We have heard that the Jabariyah claim as followers of theirs the Najjariyah and the Dhirariyah, whom we accordingly reckon as such....

Salisbury, butes [of the Deity], but went beyond them in several particu- lars: 1. He declared it to be inadmissible that the Creator should have predicated'of him any attribute which is ascribed to his creatures, because that would inevitably lead to an an- thropomorphism (L-s"); and therefore he denied that God possesses [the attributes of] life and knowledge, but maintained that he is powerful, an agent, and a creator-because to none of his creatures is given the attribute of ability, or the faculty of action, or creativeness (Xl;b I$ 4S .., UL6 L. L.&gt; .4 acs ,^\^ )J\ va^ l u XAli -2S,A Co $ Y &amp;3 L_i). 2. He maintained that the Creator has contingent cognitions, not in- herent in a subject (J.s ' J.:i L5,)U ^l 'Lo. .lb): he said that it was impossible that God should know a thing before its creation, for [said he], if he knows and then creates, does his knowledge [after the creation of a thing] remain the same as before, or not?-if the former, then is it ignorance, because to know that a thing will exist must differ from knowing that it already exists; but, if his knowledge does not remain as before, then there is a change in it, and what is subject to change is created, not eternal [and thus it is proved, that no eternal quality of knowledge pertains to the divine essence]. He agreed in this with Hisham Bin 'al-Hakam, who ... said that if the contingency of knowledge [as a divine quality] is to be maintained, one must suppose either that it originates in the essence of God-whic would lead to the idea of a change in the divine essence, and to the conception of that essence as subject to eontingences (o'c- ' ?

J_IJ ox . .s , i); so that evidently it is not quality inherent in a subject (s ~ ! a . c^): and accordingly Hisham held to [manifold] divine cognitions, which are contingent, corresponding to the number of existing things known to God (s&gt;).? !l t 3,4L ts.

"The 1Arijjdiyah-followers of 'al-Husain Bin Muhammad 'an-Najjar,* whose doctrine gained the acceptance of most of the Mu'tazilah of Rai and its vicinity. ... They agreed with the Mu'tazilah in the denial of the [divine] attributes, namely, knowledge, power, will, life, hearing, and sight, and at the same time agreed with the Sifativah in viewing conduct as created [by God] (34L=I 'il A S). 'An-Najjar said that the Creator exercises volition in and of himself, just as he knows in and of himself (I;j Ij P .l sb ;lz . L5Li); and so he could not avoid the inference that every thing depends upon the divine will ( 'i.;jl . jls), and was compelled to say that God wills moral good and evil, as well as benefit and injury. He also said that what is meant by his exercising volition is, that he is not a being who acts under constraint, or is forced (. aJ .iA, , ). Furthermore, he said that God creates the conduct of his creatures, good and bad, virtuous and vicious, while man appropriates the same (L&amp;J ..I -.aS,); and held that there is an influence exerted [with respect to conduct] by created ability ('ZoLS?t )XilJ L,ib'), which he called appropriation (L...), agreeably to the view maintained by 'al-'Ash'ari, with whom he accorded also in holding that free will is an accompa- niment of human action (J.tVi-l ^rL^-:Y ot) [and not a pre- requisite, in the sense of power to originate volition]. ... Mu- harnlnad Bin 'Isa, known by the appellation of Burghuth, Bishr Bin 'Attab 'al-Marisi, and 'al-Husain 'an-Najjar, stood near to one another in their opinions; and all maintained that God's will- ing ceases not as respects whatsoever of moral good and evil, belief and infidelity, obedience and disobedience, he knows is to come to pass ( h jl o J 5j t&amp; CLx SSI K.4-, A BLM L.3 0 l 3 ,;#)-which most of the Mu'tazilah would not admit."

These two teachers also maintained that the actions of men are really created by the Creator, and that mankind appropriate them, in the strict sense. At the same time they admitted the possibility of an action's taking place as the joint product of two actors (i.. ~ i ..&gt; e ..&gt;). They held, moreover, that God can transmute accidents into bodies, and that free will and inability appertain to the body, and are corporeal (,w.&gt;*- .-? .. j-v-.: ^;lc.l' I)." . . "The .Sfdtiyah (".La.l lit. Attributists). Be it known that most persons adhering to the primitive faith were wont to maintain that certain eternal attributes pertain to God, namely, knowledge, power, life, will, hearing, sight, speech, majesty, magnanimity, bounty, beneficence, glory, and greatness-mak- ing no distinction between attributes of essence and attributes of action; ... and were wont to hold to certain descriptive attri- butes ( '..r # o.), as, for example, hands and face, without any other explanation than to say that these attributes enter into the revealed representation of the Deity, and that, accordingly, they had given them the name of descriptive attributes. Thus it came to pass that, after the Mu'tazilah denied the [divine] attributes, while men of the primitive faith affirmed their real existence, the latter received the appellation of Sifatiyah, and the Mu'tazilah that of Mu'attilah ('JUa.Lx lit. Voiders). But some of those who were of the primitive faith, in maintaining the reality of the [divine] attributes, went to the extreme of like- ning them to attributes of created things (:u'u . L lLiA^j x... ); while others were content to hold that there are certain [divine] attributes, which are proved by acts, and went not beyond the statements of Revelation. Two parties thus arose, of which the one explained the [divine] attributes figuratively, according to the expressions applied to them, and the other came to a stand in respect to figurative interpretation, saying: 'We know, * Both probably not later than the ninth century: s.

At a later period, certain persons went beyond what had been pro- fessed by any who held to the primitive faith, and said thatf undoubtedly, those expressions [denoting the attributes] are used in the literal sense, and are to be interpreted just as they stand, without resort to figurative interpretation, and at the same time without insisting upon the literal sense alone, whereby they fell into pure anthropomorphism (~2At a^XJ) in violation of the primitive Muslim faith ... "The 'Asha'riyah [a subdivision of the Sifatlyah]-followers of 'Abu-1-Hasan 'All Bin 'Isma'il 'alb'Asha'ri,t so named from 'Abif Mtsa 'al^'Asha'ri," .., whose doctrinal views were the same as those of 'Abu-l-Hasan, and of whom the story is told that, in answer to 'Amrfi Bin 'al-'As, who asked: "Does God determine something for me, and then punish me on account of it ( ,.L r f d ) Lc )J~I.)?" he said: "Yes," and that, when Amrt inquired: "Wherefore ?" he replied: "Becausehe does thee no injustice." ... 'Abu-l-Hasan said; "These attri- butes [of the Deity] are eternal, subsistent in the essence of God (}tJai 'l\X. 'tS): we say not that they constitute the Deity, and are nothing more [than simply divine essence]; neither do we deny that they constitute the Deity, and are not additional to his essence (3 .' 'M ' M, _ - , ' . . ). As for proof that God speaks by an eternal word, and wills by an eternal will ('-? . . stLb. ^X.), said he, it is evident that God is a sovereign, and, as a sovereign is one to whom it belongs to command and prohibit, so God commands and prohibits; there is, then, no alternative but that he commands either by an eternal ordering or by an ordering in time, and, if his ordering is in time, that it originates either in his own essence, or in some [other] subject (,Y_ ,? 3), or without inherence in a subject (-)' &amp; M 3t); but that it originates in his own essence is absurd, because one would have, on that ground, to admit that God is subject to con- tingences (_-~ h o-~ ..

He also said that God's knowledge is indi- visible, embracing all things cognizable-the impossible and the possible, the necessary, the existent and the non-existent p,~t4I); and that his power is indivisible, extending to all things which are normal, within the range of possibility (' . .ojL , ~o. 3 ? .y. . L o..); and that his will is indivisible, reaching to all things which admit of special determination ((oj; j:i.' ia . . l) ) . .. He said, moreover, that the will of God is indivisible, eternal, embracing all things sub- ject to volition, whether determinate actions of his own, or ac- tions of his creatures-the latter, so far as created by him, not as they are their own actions by appropriation (IsXs.f jl')It '.&gt; &amp;)LA JzL,= 3'6t3 xs ^8 o S L_. " L CIA ' jt J K i.C&lt; :iI '^^s I, $ s ik.f Lc); and, further, that God wills all things, morally good and evil, beneficial and injurious; and, as he both knows and wills, that he wills on the part of his creatures what he knows, and has caused to be registered in the memorial-book (L5&gt; t L lo J (IA oU. lC $JA^ JI .Ut J . )--which foreknowledge constitutes his de- cree, his decision, and his determination, wherein there is no vary- ing nor change (3.-.4.

These statements prove that his doctrine admitted of obligation to do that which is im- possible.""* Yet he held it to be absurd to suppose that there can be moral obligation without any power at all over action. "He said that man's having power over his actions follows from his perceiving within himself a necessary distinction between move- ments which result from threatening and terror and those which come of the power of choice and volition-a distinction amount- ing to this, that movements which result from the power of choice take place under the condition of ability, and are dependent * i. e., since God predestines only what he foresees will take place, he predes- tines some men to be vicious, for whom, then, it is impossible, in respect to fore- knowledge, that they should be virtuous; and yet all men are under obligation to be virtuous. 176</page><page sequence="73">Muhammadan Predestination and Free Will. upon the power of choice in a being possessing ability (x.J. -,cjt1 o!^&gt; o*? ^u..

On the principles of 'Abu-l-Hasan, however, no influence in respect to origination [of action] pertains to cre- ated ability (~l-XJ c i ' /..L I xa LJL ^.Ij M); because all origi- nal existence comes of one determining act (c,ij t '+- J '~ I :..^)c, the same for substance and accident, so that, if there pertains to created ability any influence in determining original existence, the same must be attributed thereto with respect to the original existence of every thing, even to supposing it adequate to produce colors, tastes, and smells, as well as substances and bodies; and so one would be led to admit that the heavens and the earth owe their existence to created ability-not to say, that God limits himself to creating, in the way of subordination to hu- man ability, or under the condition thereof, and in concurrence therewith (L4t 'L.' i ' L I &gt;:t .? .. 'j . . a.w 5j. ), whatever [human] action is to take place, when man wills it and applies himself thereto. Such action [as his theory supposes on the part of man] is called by 'Abu-l-Hasan an appropriation (Y.^.): it is therefore created by God [alone], so far as respects causing to be and origination ('l t WSLa A' tlp l Jt iLSt&gt;.); and appropriated by man, in respect to taking place under the condition of human ability (C.- or , t..w diij w'). "The Kadhi 'Abu Bakr 'al-Bakillani* departed somewhat from this definition, for he declared it to be incontrovertibly proved that created ability is not adequate to causing [action] to be (L.-uj , L' jY), and yet that all the qualities of action, or its modes and distinguishing features, are not involved in its mere existence (csl t L..

[\ * '~[ 9L Jt y 5 J S, JJ LS gJ Lc..); and since, he also said, it is a question, on the principles of the Mu'tazilah, whether ability, or the original power [which they ascribe to man], exercises its influence in producing a [constant] state, that, namely, of existence and being, or [simply] effectuates some one of the modes of action ('.. o ' iij J. t Cu.lj. tYlj *.Jx u&gt;. Cr.), why must the influence of [our] created ability be exercised in the production of what is a [constant] state, to wit, the speciality of the existing, and not rather upon one of the modes of action, namely, for example, that motion takes a particular form ? (3[L..~ ,i 'x.l siil.." ' , . I jL.- MJs ? ~;l' ) ... and as one may not ascribe to the Creator any part of that which [wholly] belongs to the creature, so may not be ascribed to the creature any part of that which [wholly] belongs to the Creator. Accordingly, the Kidhi maintained that created ability exercises an influence [upon human action], and that its influence [thereupon] is the characteristic circumstance pertaining to it; which circumstance constitutes a certain aspect of [human] action, springing out of the connection between crea- ted ability and action-an aspect in harmony with reward and punishment ( cr 3aJI l o ',- ~ 'r[Jt cJtI LX . " 9LAt 1 M ! 4t A- I it.iJV, v :lS).) ... But the ImAm of the two sacred cities, 'Abu- l-Ma'ali 'aj-Juwaini* .,. deviated a little from this explanation [of the Kadhi], and said that the denial of ability and free will is something which reason and consciousness disavow (vi6 Llt Is .SiI aLb. tsi x.4 lt.ai X\ii); that to affirm an ability without any sort of efficacy is equivalent to denying ability alto- gether, and that to affirm some unintelligible influence [of ability] which constitutes some circumstance or other amounts to the denial of any special influence; and that, inasmuch as states, on the principles of those who maintain them, are not to be characterized as existing or non-existing [but must be explained * Died in 1085.: Ib Khhallik,, p. 408, 178</page><page sequence="75">Muhammadan Predestination and Free Will. by reference to their origin], action on the part of man [regarded as an existing state] is to be attributed, really, to his own ability ( . .. iJi. $sJf t Xj.I J, Yj . ^or IjS1 . J &gt;)-not that this is put forth in the way of origination and creation (. cS Y J'L2Ut I c'l-oti)-for creation is understood to be a causing of something to arise, by supreme power, out of non-existence, and mankind are just as conscious of not having supreme power as they are of having efficiency ()t,lkxi)-but that action depends for its existence upon ability [in man] (C3lt 1 &amp;. J'. -IJ sipxSJ), which itself depends for its existence upon some other cause, its relation to that cause being the same as the relation of [human] action to [man's] ability, and so one cause depends upon another until the Cause of causes (Ls..t e.) is reached, namely, the Creator of causes and their operations (JLil4 L4jL.~. .JL?U), the Absolute Self-sufficing (L5. c^"' ?Jo'lt); for every [secondary] cause is in one respect self-suffi- cient, and in another respect dependent (.L;' . r, QC:ir*. .3 cr-), while the Creator is the Absolute Self-sufficing (5;Jit '%..t), who depends not, nor is deficient in any thing. This view of the subject was borrowed by 'Abu-l-Ma'ali from the Philosophers of the theistic school, but he originated its pre- sentation in the garb of dogmatic theology. ... " We return, now, to the theological views of the originator of the system. 'Abu-l-Hasan 'All Bin 'Isma'il 'al-'Ash'ari said [furthermore] that, inasmuch as the Creator (J.L1i) is truly the Originator (sLJ)), with whom no other [person or thing] is associated in creation, his most distinguishing characteristic is the power of original production (?t&gt; S-i cSC LXiiJt), by which, said he, his name of 'Allah is to be explained." ... 'Al-'Ash'ar said, also, that, " if he [who has committed a great sin] repents, he would not affirm it to be obligatory upon God, by virtue of any decision of reason, to accept that person's repentance, since he is the Imposer of Obligation, and no obligation is imposed upon him (d5 .s. .S .. st l. it j); but rather that Reve- lation declares that the repentance of the penitent will be ac- cepted, and the cry of the needy answered; and that God rules as a sovereign over his creatures, doing what he wills and deter- mining as he pleases (Lao L. dL.. Lo 's.i. &amp;aL A JU tl J...j.); so that, were he to cause all men to enter Paradise, there would be no injustice, and, if he were to send them all to Hell, there would be no wrong-doing: because injustice is the ordering in respect to things which do not come within the 179</page><page sequence="76">E. E. Sa&amp;isbury, sphere of control of the orderer (4IJ 4 s L4.. M . (A O.J .y), or the inverting of established relations of things (3 ti .' A.~y4 .), and God is the Absolute Sovereign (jilla ~?lt), on whose part no injustice is imaginable, and to whom no wrong can be attributed; ... and that nothing whatever is obligatory upon God, by virtue of reason (JL..o l IL.' i Ut . .c. . ) -neither that which is beneficial, nor that which is most advanta- geous, nor gracious assistance ... and that the ground of [human] obligation is nothing which constitutes a necessity binding upon God (O 3lt L.&gt;,i Cj &lt; i. .L..i, J ,)." ... Furthermore, it was part of the doctrine of 'al-'Ash'ari that "faith and obedience are the result of divine aid, and unbelief and disobedience the re- sult of God's failing to assist (. LW.i xt . ' i OL.' I- djY&gt; . ^~*_.l.I); and he held this divine aid to be a creation of power to obey ('Ull k jS iaJS i.i'), and God's failing to assist to be a creation of power to disobey (, xI ' uL- .,^^xt?); but some of his followers regarded the furtherance of causes of moral good (.-t .L..w. .) as constituting the di- vine aid, and the reverse as constituting the failure to assist." "The Karrdmtyah-followers of 'Abu 'Abdallah Muhammad Bin Karram, whom we count as one of the Sifatiyah because he was an assertor of the divine attributes, though he ended with ascribing materiality to God, and the profession of an- thropororphism. . .. They held, also, that to God pertains an eternal choice, which has to do with the original principles of created things, and with contingences of his own essence (Xj.jJ c9 \^\l .^\ c UL^"t (J IAl kj*tX flXj L. O); and they affirmed that there are volitions [on the part of God] which come into existence in time, having to do with the spe- cialities of created things (LS.-L SLD j . '41,:*, 'L. obt^). But it was universally agreed among them that things con- tingent [to the divine essence] are not necessary qualifications of the Deity, and do not constitute attributes pertaining to him; so that those contingent acts of speaking, willing, hear- ing, and seeing [referred to in the Kuran], happen to the es- sence of God, without his becoming thereby a speaker, exer- ciser of volition, hearer, or seer, while his actual production of these contingences does not constitute him a producer, or crea- tor; but he is a speaker only by virtue of his speaking'quality, a creator only by virtue of his creating-quality, and an exerciser of volition only by virtue of his willing-quality-each of which qualities is the same as his power in respect to the several things 180</page><page sequence="77">Muhammadan Predestination and Free 'Will. referred to (. q ..L o..

It was, however, a fundamental principle with them, that the contingences which God originates in his essence necessarily abide (4LiJ i&gt;t), so that their non- existence were an absurdity; since, if they could become non- existent, there would be permutable contingences of the divine essence, and the substance [of the Deity] would partake of this alteration (K,LLJ, t U3 j _ l-J xJ ) L4*1 j-I 3 - ..A'S~ci ?k X .pyi). ... Another fundamental principle of theirs was, that whatever ordinance God originates in his essence is either causative, that is, active and resulting in something done, or non-causative (namely, either declarative, or directive and prohibitive), constituting actions, so far as that it gives evi- dence of power [to act in the way of enforcement], yet not re- sulting in any thing done ('gst s i' 3 , X'.

He said, moreover, that he and his party held to pre- destination of moral good and evil by God (o- ,a - )w cJl Ai), and that God wills all things which are, bad as well as good, and creates all existences, including both virtue and vice (I,3 4_~, L~ L ,, _kI 'o,.x ? LP~.. L..v jUO.mS 3i1); while, at the same time, they maintained that man is an agent by virtue of created ability ('J[LI LAjL.

A review of the whole ground which we have thus gone over naturally leads to the inquiry how it came about that predesti- narianism, though only one side of the doctrine of the relations of God to human conduct and destiny, as presented in the Kuran and tradition, and notwithstanding all efforts of philosophy to de- velop the consistency of free will with predestination, should have finally predominated as it did in the speculations and practice of the Muhammadan world. The answer to this inquiry must be found, we apprehend, in a certain degeneration of the Arab mind, in general, which began even in the next age after that of Muiammad, under the mingled oppression and relaxing in- fluence of governmental absolutism, alike secular and religious, unfitting it to assert its birthright of freedom, and limiting it to such activity as might consist with bondage to the ruling power of the state. It is obvious that no doctrine of free will could become predominant under the dominion of absolute princes, while, in such a condition of things, the tendency was almost irresistible to magnify the doctrine of divine decrees. Let it be considered, also, that such degeneration of the national mind was the more natural because, as we have seen, fatalism was the normal belief of the Arabs, so to speak, in their state of semi-civilization before Muhammad. These remarks suggest another, on a kindred topic of inquiry. Too much stress, we think, has been laid upon their belief in predestination as accounting for the heroism of the first Muslim conquerors: the predominance of that belief belongs, in our view, to " the age of ignorance," and to a nearly related period of degeneration; while we are disposed to ascribe the heroic achievements of the personal followers and early disciples of Muhammad fully as much, at least, to an awakened conscious- ness of power in their own wills, as to the persuasion of a fa- voring divine predestination, or to a self-abandonment to abso- lute divine decrees.
