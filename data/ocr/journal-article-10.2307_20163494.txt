<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Listening to Homer G. S. Kirk, The Iliad: A Commentary. Volume II: Books 5-8 (Cambridge University Press, 1990), xv + 351 pages, $69.50 PAOLO VIVANTE 1 T A HIS second volume of Kirk's commentary of the Iliad follows the footsteps of the first. It is, again, filled with var ied learning. The notes on textual criticism and the references to Alexandrian scholarship and to the scholia richly compensate for the lack of a text and apparatus criticus. Moreover, Kirk's interest in mythology and history puts him in good stead to explore the background. We thus find abundant information on places, cities, regions. Not least notable in this connection are Kirk's inquiries into proper names, even the names of heroes who appear once only. In such cases, he keenly pursues that type of research which prompted his notes on the Catalogue of Ships in the first volume of the commentary. For particular instances of insight and interpretation, we may point to the comments on the food and blood of the gods (5.339-42) or on the image of Ares as a savage war-god (5.885-7). This is, however, too massive a commentary in many ways. The reader will be deterred right at the beginning by learning, in the editorial introduction, that the study of the Iliad requires "a whole battery of philological, historical, archaeological, theo logical, mythological and sociological knowledge." But most burdensome is the formular and thematic apparatus. We find meticulously appended to any formula the number of its recur rences, parallel themes and passages are scrupulously noted; and if a phrase or sentence does not occur elsewhere, we are confi dently told that it was created for the occasion. The student of formulas will prefer to look up the actual instances in a concor dance, while the common reader will ignore the matter and pass on. In any case, we are continually distracted from the particular quality of a given passage. At a certain point, the stylistic analy sis seems to become an end in itself. There is much about a "cumulative" style that proceeds through appositions from verse to verse. Or, again, the style is "linear," "progressive" in that it takes a forward direction, without turning back. The ter</page><page sequence="2">172 ON LISTENING TO HOMER minology can be quite startling: Sarpedon's plea in 5.684-8 is "cumulative and complex." This abstract notion of style may be useful from a theoretic point of view, but hardly encourages the student's interest in what Homer has to say. Let us put ourselves in the student's place. As he starts, he will find for commentary on //. 1.1 a short essay on the proem as a lit erary genre but nothing on the significance of the word menis. At verse 2, he will find no adequate comment on the difficult word ov\o\i?vx\v, but he is referred to the "cumulative tech nique." Similar difficulties beset him as he works through the commentary. A screen of literary or scholarly assumptions is constantly placed between him and the text. How does this stylistic analysis affect our view of Homer or the student's approach? Kirk writes that the commentator's task is to show in detail what is traditional and what invented, altered, or adapted by the composer; but these qualitative ele ments cannot possibly be sifted like the ingredients of a chemical experiment. The task he takes upon himself is as unmanageable as that which he imposes upon the student. The latter, who is primarily interested in the meaning of a word or passage, is also faced with the problem of composition. His very reading will be infected with a formular or thematic bias. As he proceeds, he might even lose his instinctive capacity for straightforward reading and taking things at their face value. The same cannot be said of Leaf's commentary. Although Leaf was an analyst, the reader can use his commentary without being troubled by ana lytical preoccupations. There is a much clearer focus on the meaning of words, phrases, sentences. Kirk's case is quite different. Since the aim of his school is no less than to explain the making of Homeric verse, his whole approach is influenced thereby. Here is an incredible self-confidence. Although Kirk maintains that his commentary is not definitive and is open minded, yet the general guidelines of his analysis are never ques tioned and no room is left for any naive or spontaneous interpretation. 2 The central problem is how the spirit of poetry may be recon ciled with formulas, themes, traditional style. Kirk hardly faces the problem; he generally refrains from any intimate appr?cia</page><page sequence="3">Paolo Vivante 173 tion. We are given a foretaste of the commentary in the four introductory essays that deal with religion, style, archaeology. Here Kirk dwells, for instance, on the process that separated the gods from their places of worship, but not on Homer's striking anthropomorphism; he goes into the myths that illustrate the split between gods and men, but does not touch on the issue of mortality and immortality that is so central to the Iliad; he com pares with Homer the relative frequency of dialogue in earlier eastern epics, but does not deal with the particular dramatic quality of Homeric dialogue; he so highlights preexisting pat terns of composition that at times Homer seems to illustrate Kirk's guidelines and not the other way round. Poetry is, so far, an epiphenomenon and not a reality in its own right. Tradition, convention, historical background, are clearly preeminent in Kirk's mind. But faced with the task of commenting on Homer line after line, how does he reconcile the tenets of oral composition with the idea of an original poet? We find a cue in his Songs of Homer, where he writes: "The prominence of repeated formulas, lines, passages and themes does not mean that Homer, the singer of the large-scale Iliad, is not original. His originality does not lie in the choice of appro priate epithets and phrases, but on the one hand in the whole conception and scale of the poem, on the other hand in the con sistently fluid and adept handling of traditional phraseology ? something not easy to achieve." And further on: "There is no reason to deny these composers linguistic originality in a large number of cases not covered by the phraseology of tradition." And elsewhere in the book: "The oral poet does not create de novo, he extends themes and discovers new thematic variants, he conflates and expands... this kind of procedure is not merely mechanical and unoriginal; it can demand the highest imagina tion and creative gifts." Kirk's approach is quite typical. Classical scholars have gener ally applauded Parry and his system of formulas, but at the same time they have been at pains to show that Homer is a great and original poet in spite of the formulas. For this formulaic diction, we are told, is by no means as absolute as might be supposed; there are phrases that can be transposed from one part of the line to the other; thus, for instance, the formula "long-shadowed spear," usually at the end of a line, appears in the middle at //. 6.126. Much work has been done in this direction. A school of</page><page sequence="4">174 ON LISTENING TO HOMER thought has emerged that has sometimes been called "soft Parryism." There is an inherent weakness in this position. The weakness consists in applauding a theory and at the same time laboring to find exceptions. Contradictory details thus take pre eminence. Homer's art as a whole gets blurred. It is as if, say, we took for granted the encompassing flow of the Parthenon frieze and, rather, paid attention to such realistic touches as a horse man turning his head or a boy adjusting his master's tunic. Homer hardly benefits this way. Concern for his originality should not lead us to seek out and extol any deviation from the norm. The proper course would have been to look at the formu las from a different angle, recognizing their intrinsic poetic value and not merely their function as compositional devices. The problem of a literal originality would have had no place. It could indeed have been shown that the Homeric formulas are, in general, a highly original mode of expression, if we take the term "original" not in the narrow sense of "novel," "newly invented" but, rather, as a quality. Any form of expression is authentic or original in that it is fully realized, vividly felt in its sound and meaning. Unfortunately, the intrinsic expressive quality of Homer's formulas has largely been ignored. The formular system high lighted by Milman Parry has been praised merely as a means to an end, the bulk of Homer's language simply passed over as "formulaic" and the attention drawn to other topics. In doing so, scholars pay more attention to what seems exceptional than to the essential ideas of the formulas. While paying homage to Parry, they carry his theories no farther. For by emphasizing any adventitious point of interest, they remain within the pale of a scholastic and rhetorical criticism. 3 Kirk's commentary is an example in point, as far as the modes of expression are concerned. It is his constant method to register the recurrence of formulas and repeated themes, while dwelling upon whatever swerves away from the usual style. The former element calls for no special comment, once it is categorized as traditional; it is the latter that draws the attention as being innovative.</page><page sequence="5">Paolo Vivante 175 Kirk thus hardly has a word of appreciation for such high lights of Homeric expression as "rose-fingered dawn" or "winged words" but goes out of his way to praise the unique "smiling with terrible countenance" (7.212) as "one of Homer's most brilliant and powerful phrases." Note the following exam ples (the emphasis is mine). "She poured her pale forearms round her son" (5.314) is "a unique and beautiful phrase." Simi larly, where Dione consoles Aphrodite (on 5.370-2), "the typi cal element diminishes in this moving scene." Verse 5.621, "he stood very close and threw the shining spear," is said to be vivid and accurate although formular. Hector's wish that Zeus grant Troy's freedom (6.527-8) is praised for its long expansive sen tence "which, unusually for the oral style, can only be construed after some delay... ."In 7.122 a phrase that usually means "to strip the armour off a victim" is used differently in a peaceful sense and Kirk comments that "by temporarily abandoning tra ditional martial associations the singer has done something noteworthy by oral standards." In 7.182 "looking back" is "a unique and attractive detail"; in 8.348 a verb which means "to whirl here and there" is again a "unique and powerful expression." The felicity of these expressions is not due to their being unique or rare ?things which, in any case, our fragmentary knowledge cannot prove. Poetic qualities come from a deeper source than what any waywardness might suggest. By thus pointing to what is exceptional or strange, Kirk constantly implies the paradox that the quality of a poem is something sep arate from its basic style. Quite similar is the tendency to emphasize any particular overtone or ulterior motive that can be elicited out of the con text. Thus, wherever possible, Kirk reads a punctilious, often ironic sense into the meaning of the epithets. In 5.168-9 the epi thets "god-like" and "faultless" attributed to Pandarus are "sub tly ironical" because Pandarus is not remarkable in this respect, lb. 550-3 "black ships" adds to the effect of sailing to one's death. In 8.69ff., where Zeus weighs on his scales the dooms of the opposing sides, we see the doom of the Achaeans sinking down to the much-nourishing earth; and the epithet "much nourishing" is supposed to be ironic. Similarly ironic are the "glorious" or "shining" limbs of Hera and Athena trembling under the threat of Zeus (8.452). On the other hand, "helmet</page><page sequence="6">176 ON LISTENING TO HOMER shining Hector" is inappropriate in 6.263, the "shining cun ningly-wrought armor" of 5.295 is "otiose." It seems perverse to drive a small fastidious point into forms of expression that constantly affirm the permanent qualities of things. There is, if at all, a much broader existential irony implying that things remain what they are even though the action spells death and ruin all around. Homer's grand outlines thus get blurred. Familiar scenes are shown in a new light that alters them or distorts them. The chal lenge of'Diomedes to Glaucus (6.123-43) is "a rhetorical ex travaganza." Glaucus comparing men's generations to the leaves of the forest (6.146ff.) is "witty and clever," and the simile itself is no better than "a poetical commonplace." Andromache's evo cation of her father Eetion (6.414ff.) is "a pathetic rhetorical embellishment" on the grounds that Hector is already aware of what she has to say. The charioted hero and goddess of 5.837ff., as strongly visualized as in a vase painting, are said to reveal "flashes of humour." The fifth book as a whole with its solemn struggles of men and gods is "one of Homer's most daring, and at times, most humorous compositions." It is similarly surprising to see the term "rhetoric" or "rhetori cal" so often applied to Homer: see the index s. v. rhetorical style. Does any poet ?let alone the alleged oral poet ?think in rhetorical terms? Is style a device, like the formulas? Kirk often implies that different styles were available, to be used at will wherever convenient. Thus the intervention of Aphrodite in 5.312ff. is conceived in "a flowing romantic style." But what is a "romantic style"? Would it not be better to say, more simply, that there is tenderness in the ample gesture of the goddess? In any case, the effect of style comes from the deeper sources of the poet's language that constantly gives a sensuous, and sometimes emotional, significance to parts of the body? in this case com pare Od. 23.240. 4 Formulas and themes, however, constitute the bulk of the com mentary. But here the interest in poetry decreases. Very rarely is a formula considered in its intrinsic poetic value, as in 6.253, 404-6. For the most part, Kirk gives parallels and analogies. He</page><page sequence="7">Paolo Vivante 177 continually tries to show how phrases are adapted to the struc ture of the hexameter and become recurring formulas. He enu merates and classifies them, he explains how certain formulas were constructed through the alteration and combination of others. Mere mechanism and technique are here supposed to explain the art of Homer. The trouble is that a form of expression cannot be so readily explained through a process of verse construction and adapta tion. An excessive concern with formulas stands in the way. For words tend to be taken for granted insofar as they constitute a formula, formulas insofar as they constitute a verse, the verse itself insofar as it carries the narrative forward. We miss, as a result, the forcefulness of meaning in the expression itself. There is no harm in simply observing the recurrence of formulas; but what disturbs us is the formular twist given, wherever possible, to any thought of the poet in the attempt to discover how any mode of expression came about. Thus in 5.7, after a simile singling out the fire which Athena causes to glow above Diomedes, we have the verse "such a fire she kindled from his head and his shoulders." Kirk remarks that the phrase "from his head and his shoulders" is part of a formu lar cluster for the idea of stripping armor from a fallen foe as in 17.205 ? a phrase adapted here to a different purpose. The anal ogy is forced. Why not compare, instead, Od. 6.235 (cp. 23.162), where (also after a simile) Athena beautifies Odysseus in the verse "such a beauty she shed upon his head and his shoul ders"? We have, in any case, quite apart from any formula, Homer's tendency to highlight a part of the body, imparting to it a quality that applies to the whole. Here is poetic focus. In //. 18.203ff. the head and shoulders of Achilles are similarly singled out in a different form of expression. In 5.715, akiov tov u?Oov i)Ji?oT?][xev, "vain was that word which we promised" is said to be "a relatively late and slightly awkward adaptation of e.g. 2.286 im?oyEOiv fjvjieg vn?oxav ? since to promise is one thing, to promise 'that saying' quite another." Kirk here forgets the rich meaning of the term "word" (u?Oo?, ?rco?) in Homer. It can convey not only the vocal utter ance but also its contents, a command, a counsel, a threat, an intimate thought, and so forth. We have, for instance, u?Oov vofjoai, "to think something" (7.358), teAicrr) ejto?, "to carry out a threat" (14.44).</page><page sequence="8">178 ON LISTENING TO HOMER In 6.387 Andromache has just heard that the Trojans are hard pressed and that "great is the force of the Achaeans," \i?ya ?? KQaxo? eivai 'Axai v (i.e., "the Achaeans are winning"). Kirk notes that this is a slightly labored combination of \i?ya KQaxo? EyyvakQ^ix) "great force I will grant" and xov y?g kqcitoc; eoti \ieyioxov "for his force is the greatest," both formular. Such a reconstruction misses the vigor of the expression as one whole. Kirk ignores the verbal significance of kratos, which can mean both "force" and "to be stronger," as in 17.623 ovketi kqcito? 'Axai v. On 7.38 "Ektoqo?; ?Qacofxev Kgateg?v uivo? ?jutoo?uoio, "let us rouse the might of horse-taming Hector," Kirk notes that "might of Hector" is a grandiose periphrasis for Hector himself, and he compares 16.189, 23.837. But these instances are not really the same. Here, in 7.38, the verb "to rouse" governs "might." There is a concrete connection between the verb and the noun: the idea of "rousing" or "stirring" evokes that of "might" or "spirit." We touch here upon the very source of the expression. We should compare, rather, the phrase (dtqwe uivo? Kai Ouu?v ekcxotov "he stirred the might and spirit of each" (5.470, 792, and so forth). In 7.131 Peleus is pictured praying that his spirit, leaving his limbs, should sink into the house of Hades, Ouuov cuto ??eA?cdv ?wai ?ofxov'A??o? eloco. Kirk notes that this use of Ovuo? in combination with the ox)vat ?ofxov formula is casual, not to say careless, since it is the tyvxr\, not the Qv\io? that normally descends to Hades. But it should be noted that here (as in Od. 15.354) the word Ovuo? is so used by a character who prays that his own soul should depart. In such a context the use of Qv\io? is appropriate and natural. Peleus (or anyone else) would not use the term tyv%v\ about himself in such a sense. For tyv%f\ is the soul quite detached from the body, a shade, a phantom objectively conceived as it fades off and inhabits the underworld. In 7.210 Ajax is compared to Ares advancing to battle among men "whom the son of Cronos brings together to fight with the might of soul-devouring strife." Kirk merely sees here an expan sion of 1.8 "brought them together to fight in strife." Such deri vation and formular approach disregards the quality of the phrase Ouuo?OQOU eqi?o? [xevei. The word uivo? elsewhere applied to the might of men or animals or natural elements, is here joined with "strife." Its sphere is broadened to the impon derables of human behavior, and the epithet "soul-devouring"</page><page sequence="9">Paolo Vivante 179 sharpens the effect. Passion materializes into imagery; and the hypostasis is like a prelude to the language of Greek tragedy. In 7.346 the Trojan assembly meets on the acropolis, ?Eivf| X?XQT\xv?a, "terrible, full of confusion," "in wondrous uproar." Kirk comments, "a curious phrase involving some strained adaptation." How can an assembly be "terrible"? he asks, at loss to find a formula or analogy for this specific meaning. We should not look for literal equivalents, but for kindred resonances in the poet's language. A run-over word often has an intensifying sense. Thus in Od. 5.403 the sea hits the shore "terrible, roar ing" or "terribly roaring." The assembly is like a sea. This one-sided approach impedes the interest in language as such. We thus might have expected something more on such a phrase as [ifj fx' ajtoymcuoric [xeveo? (6.265) "do not unlimb me of my strength" ? a phrase so vitally suggestive of a man's body in resilience and weakness. Or, again, on 6.523-4, to ?'?uov kt\q I axwrai ?v Ouux?, "there is a heart-pang in my spirit," it is not enough to say that Homer uses these terms quite loosely. The concern with formulas diminishes, rather than enhances, the concern with language. Kirk himself, in his editorial intro duction, confirms this point. He says that his abridgment of lin guistic matters is deliberate because of the artificiality of the Homeric language in which words of different provenance are adapted to the metrical form. But, even from a formular point of view, it must be admitted that the formulas do not result in any arbitrary mannerism. In spite of any artificiality, the language of Homer could be understood by thousands of listeners, it has a pervasive self-consistency, its very clarity encourages the study of expression qua expression, quite apart from any formulas. Kirk disregards linguistic concerns in that, as he puts it, the normal logic of linguistic development does not necessarily apply to Homer. What he has in mind are points of date or prov enance in the history of words ? as if the linguist's task were confined to these matters. Inseparable from these, and impor tant in their own right, are questions of expressive value ? ques tions which are muted and crystallized in the notion of formula. 5 Kirk's treatment of formulas is naturally extended to that of themes. Just as formulas standardize the language, so do themes</page><page sequence="10">l8o ON LISTENING TO HOMER regulate the poet's imagination. Nothing seems taken at its face value. There is hardly a thought of the poet that is not treated as a traditional theme or placed in some cultural slot. Glaucus or Sarpedon rebukes Hector; and we have "a rebuke pattern." Helenus bids Hector to Troy for an offering to Athena; and we have "an advice pattern." Whenever possible, following the guidelines of B. C. Fenik, Kirk observes recurring patterns in the battle scenes. If there are narrative complications and no satis factory analogy is available, he discovers adaptations and con flations. Thus in 5.121ff., wounded Diomedes is stirred up by Athena, his strength increased threefold. Why not take the pas sage naturally, in the sense of an ultimate effort that overcomes the effect of the wound? But no, Kirk (on 135-6) sees here the conflation of two thematic motifs, (a) a god heals a hero, (b) a god increases a hero's strength. In 5.127 Athena removes from the eyes of Diomedes the cloud that prevents him from distin guishing between gods and men. A power of vision is bestowed upon him (cp. Od. 16.159-62); but Kirk sees here "the-mist over-the-eyes-motif," citing in support instances of a god dark ening the battlefield for any particular purpose. Such a line of interpretation becomes a habit of thought. The tendency to schematize and classify is carried to great length. Acts or emotions become stereotypes, actual experience a cus tom or convention. Hector's assertion that he grieves more for Andromache than for his brothers or for Troy itself (6.450ff.) is "a scale-of-affection" theme. His statement that he learnt to be brave (6.444) is not a broad human disposition but "a question of family and class." His valor itself (6.441-3) is "part of the heroic code." On 6.447ff., about Hector's words "for well I know ... Troy will fall ... ," Kirk finds fault with the particle y?g "for" in that it would make Hector "concentrate on reputa tion alone since he knew the city could not be saved." But why so belittle or conventionalize his motive? In the hopelessness of the situation nothing is left but to fight. In the whole passage 6.405-502, the moment of crisis elicits Andromache's and Hector's most human emotions. A passion ate train of thought is set in motion. We should try to follow its transitions from point to point, however baffling they are. But Kirk looks at the passage in terms of composition. He writes (on 440-65), "Ex cathedra aesthetic assessments are to be avoided here, but one general aspect may be noted. The recurrent and</page><page sequence="11">Paolo Vivante 181 deliberate conjunction of two styles normally kept distinct, even if not completely so, is certainly significant: the severe and heroic on the one hand, the intimate and compassionate on the other." Can a style so preexist the poem? Can it exist in vacuo? Are styles ever so joined together? Surely no poet ever proceeds in this fashion. When Astyanax screams at Hector's helmet, surely the instant association comes from a sense of the happen ing itself and does not need any labored conjunction of different styles. 6 Construction here tends to replace conception. Kirk looks in the same way at the Iliad as a whole. What he admires is the way in which the multiplicity of themes and formulas is woven to gether to build up a large narrative structure. He insists much more on the large-scale plan of the poem than on the dramatic development that leads from the wrath of Achilles to the final compassion of the Priam scene. The narrative structure is thus paramount. Just as any part of the poem subserves a general plan, so is any single scene instru mental to some particular effect within this purview. The encounter of Diomedes and Glaucus (6.119ff.) is said to act as an emotional transition to Hector's meetings in the beleaguered town. In 8.198-212 the dialogue of Hera and Poseidon, which echoes on Olympus the human plight down below, is regarded as no more than a stopgap between two different battle scenes. In 5.471ff., Sarpedon's rebuke of Hector is a convenient way of introducing the latter after a long absence. In 5.711, Hera notices Hector advancing; and we are told that the "noticing" device is used for a change of scene. Everything must make narrative sense down to the nicest detail. Kirk thus labors many points that would escape the com mon reader. At 5.226-7 why is Aeneas on a chariot whereas pre viously he was on foot? In 349ff. we have a similar question about Diomedes. In 6.321-4 Paris idly handling his arms cannot be taken at face value, he must be preparing for the next fight. In 7.271-2 Hector is struck down and Apollo stands him up again; Kirk observes that the god was still watching from the oak tree.</page><page sequence="12">l82 ON LISTENING TO HOMER This stress on narrative connections obscures the vividness of individual scenes. There is, especially in the Iliad, a sudden immediacy. Why does Athena at a particular point give might and courage to Diomedes? Why, in the battle-scenes, does any hero suddenly appear out of nowhere only to vanish a moment later? The presentation is sufficient in itself. We are spared any further inquiry. If, at 5.226-7, Homer had found it necessary to explain why Aeneas was on a chariot, the effect of immediacy would have been lost. The strong realization of characters at a certain spot and moment is what accounts most particularly for Homer's power. The narrative talent is secondary. In Kirk's view, it is the large-scale composition that is more important. Hence comes his idea of a monumental composer or poet. But how is the term "monumental" applicable to poetry? It points to size and stateliness; it is not suggestive of any purely poetic quality. The effort of construction leaves no room for that moment of realization whereby a vital movement is imparted to the mythical or traditional material. The "monumental poet" is therefore unconvincing. He is supposed to be an original genius, and yet spends his time adapt ing, conflating, compiling. Has any perception of the world around him ever found its way into his work? He is so steeped in tradition that he does not seem concerned with anything else. As a consequence, we cannot really know him. Although often mentioned, he is too shadowy a figure even to provide us with a working hypothesis. The fiction cannot be maintained for long. Kirk himself uses the term "composer" or "singer," now in the singular, now in the plural. Nor is any help afforded here by the theory of oral composition which was supposed to have solved once and for all the unitarian-analyst controversy and especially the problem of earlier or later versions; Kirk finds himself drawn to discuss precisely such a point ?which instance of a repeated passage was the original model, who imitated whom. See his notes 5.590-5, 719-52, 807-8, 6.319-20, 7.54-6, 8.343-7, 538-41. 7 An important feature of Kirk's commentary is the interest in co lometry : in those rhythmical units of expression ? or cola ? that</page><page sequence="13">Paolo Vivante 183 compose the hexameter. These cola, highlighted in a fundamen tal study of H. Fr?nkel (1926) and a subsequent one of H. N. Porter (1951), have been largely neglected in favor of the formu las. Parry ignores them. And yet through them we may realize the underlying rhythm of Homeric verse ? a realization that is hardly possible in the mechanical scanning of foot after foot. It is a question of modulation. In reciting a verse our voice takes its time. There are pauses and transitions within the verse. The forward movement is interspersed by points of suspense. We thus usually find a central caesura (or break) besides other minor caesuras. Any verse can be so recited, by marking the points at which sound and meaning coincide in a momentary interval ? for instance, To be/or not to be: // that is /the question; whether/'tis nobler // in the mind/to suffer ... By paying attention to these stops and starts, we come closer to the rhythm than if we parsed the verse according to syllables and feet or than if we just read it casually. Meaning pierces through rhythm and vice versa. We realize expression in the making.What stands out is not verse as a mere statement that runs through its standard measure, but verse as it finds its form through a vital succession of climax and anticlimax, point and counterpoint. This division into cola is of course fluid and irregular, but it is this freedom that makes it interesting. We see how prevailing trends take hold. Thus, as in the verses just quoted, but more dis tinctly and pervasively, we usually find in Homeric verse four cola. They result from favored positions of pause or word-end, a central caesura in the middle of the verse, and two minor caesu ras respectively occurring towards the middle of the first and second half. The effect is that of an upward and downward beat. We might expect such an effect to be rigid and monotonous, but it is in fact nimble and delicate, modulated as it is by the minor caesuras. The voice confidently rises and then gradually sub sides. We may reproduce the effect in translation. Take the first verse of the Iliad, "The wrath do sing/o goddess, // of Pelides / Achilles." There is a brisk start, a rising movement that culmi nates in the goddess and then a cadence that expands in the pon derous name of the hero. The sudden initial excitement finds its object.</page><page sequence="14">l84 ON LISTENING TO HOMER In so arching the verse, rhythm has a natural flow. Thus a sound has its echo, a body its shadow. It is as if a keynote were applicable to any occurrence. Homer's rhythm does not empha size any particular overtone, but merges any peculiar detail into a basic sound sequence. Fr?nkel, trying to condense the implica tions of rhythm in terms of meaning, writes about the cola: "Through this modulation, each verse becomes a miniature stanza, and each of its cola, within the purview of the whole, can unfold a characteristic life of its own. So, for instance, the first colon may be lively and energetic, the second more objective and relaxed, the third often emotional... while the last one is, again, more solemn and expansive.... A verse can introduce at the beginning a person or a thing, the second colon can add a verb so that we have a sentence, while the third echoes the first with a significant epithet...." Fr?nkel's qualifications are not to be taken as rules, but along these lines we gain insight into the way meaning and rhythm coincide. The varying rhythmical positions tend to correspond to varying modes of being or of action. The very succession of sounds seems to find its poetic logic in the way things happen and appear and find a conclusion. Hence action attains its music. By blending in combinations that satisfy the ear, words or phrases extend to human meanings something of that rhythm which is inscribed in nature at large. But it is not just a question of euphony. There is a more basic harmony. It is what makes a verse seem inevitable both in sound and meaning. A certain meter thus arises from rhythmical phrases that take their form. The formulas are a result, not a cause. It is the sense of rhythm that is more basic and takes precedence. This is why we find cola and caesuras quite generally in poetry, but not for mulas. The Greek tragic trimeter is an example in point. About Homer, we might say at most that the formulas sharpen the sense of rhythm into distinctive, easily recognizable forms. They are not to be taken for granted, as a reason sine qua non. Kirk, however, is not concerned with the broader implica tions of rhythm. He clings to the formulas as elements of com position. Unlike Fr?nkel and Porter, he subjects rhythm to verse construction and speaks of cola as "receptacles of formular phrases." Playing down these scholars, he writes that "much of their work was concerned with a search for detailed formalistic rules which are simply not inherent in the material." What Kirk</page><page sequence="15">Paolo Vivante 185 calls "formalistic" lies really at the core of the matter. These "formalistic rules" are nothing less than the ways and means in which verse strives towards form. Kirk might here object that aesthetic or philosophical ideas are not what this commentary is about; and yet any explanation of rhythm misses the point without some notion of an underly ing poetic reason. What we have is at best a static view of the facts, a survey of metrical solutions, and rhythm is reduced to an arrangement of formulas. Once it is shown how the system works in a technical sense, nothing more need be said. Why, we may ask, these paradigms of formulas and cola? What are they all about? But Kirk avoids discussing their intrin sic significance. Rather than questioning the normative trends of Homeric rhythm, he turns his attention to variants and singu lar rhythmic effects. As in the case of the formulas, it is the exception that stands out and not the rule. There is no need to beg the question in this case, a ready explanation may be found in some adventitious point brought out by the rhythm. It is then no wonder that Kirk shows little interest in the usual fourfold division of Homeric verse and singles out those verses that lack (or weaken) the normal central caesura of the third foot and have a stronger caesura in the fourth. These verses pre sent a threefold division. They appear to have a quicker pace. Sometimes the three cola lengthen as they proceed, giving the impression of a heightening stress. Kirk coins for them the term "rising threefolder." An example is 5.174, which he divides thus: akK ?yE tcp?'/?(j)E? ?v?gi ?e^oc / Ail X??Qa? ?vaoxcov, "but come now upon him/upon that man shoot the arrow/lifting your hands in prayer." We could, however, maintain the four fold division: "Come now / shoot on that man/your arrow/lift ing your hands in prayer." The short third colon ("arrow") would then prolong the moment of suspense. Compare 5.130, 161,414,490, and so forth. Most generally, for the sake of a final emphasis, Kirk has a long colon at the end, neglecting the taper ing modulation that often concludes the verse, e.g., 5.313, 263, 461. Even where the verse certainly divides into three, the rhetori cal effect is not necessarily there. Rhythm has an essentially different function. It is not a subsidiary means to emphasize any point. On the contrary, it checks any intemperate effect; it main tains its integrity in simply bringing out the tempo of the utter</page><page sequence="16">l86 ON LISTENING TO HOMER anee and letting any special point merge with a measure that pursues its course. There are other means of expression ? words, intonations ?to convey any particular emphasis. Thus even insults in Homer tend to take a fourfold rhythm (cp. 1.122, 149, 158, 3.39). The dramatic effect lies in the bitterness of meaning; but the utterance itself finds its balance and solemnity in the moment of the verse. There is poetic sense in this implicit contrast between what is narratively or dramatically relevant and what must ever have its momentary beat. This is not to say that rhythm does not contribute to meaning, but it does so unobtrusively ? by simply letting anything take a stronger sig nificance as it finds place or position in a recurring flux. The attitude toward rhythm is symptomatic. In a similar way Kirk deals with alliteration. As in the case of the "rising three folders," Kirk sees here a medium of heightened stress. Thus the repetition of the m-sound in |iE[xau&gt;TE \i?%eoQai (5.244) is sup posed to convey a sense of urgency. What then about the repeated d of Tu?e??t] Aiouti?e? in the preceding verse? Com pare his notes on 5.314-5, 652-4, 6.61-2, 466-70, 7.88. Allit eration has generally been disregarded in Greek as opposed to Latin; Meillet discounts its importance in Homer. It is its rarity, perhaps, that has made the instance of 23.116 so conspicuous. Kirk, however, finds as many instances as suit his purpose. Sounds certainly have an evocative effect; but the implications cannot be pressed. Kirk, selecting a number of instances, wrongly gives the impression that we have here a definite rhetor ical technique. Similarly, he lays much store on internal rhymes. Or, very often, he points to a sense of excitement in the enjamb ment. He generally strains a sound or a word to bring out what seems to me a non-Homeric effect. Thus, on 8.366?70, he sees a pun in the verb "to hate" (oxvy?ei) after Styx in the preceding verse. Such concealed sardonic humor is not in keeping with Homer's directness. 8 The student may most likely benefit from Kirk's interest in co lometry, without necessarily adopting his conclusions. He will at least pay more attention to rhythm rather than metrical scan sion. Here is a mode of appreciation that could be developed.</page><page sequence="17">Paolo Vivante 187 Remember, however, that in spite of any analysis, Homer's verse maintains its mystery and freshness. No matter how many times a verse may recur, we should read it as if it were for the first time. Only thus can we recover something of a formula's original value: by realizing its present effectiveness and not by trying to find out (even if it were possible) when and where and by whom it was first used. Take even such an ordinary verse as "to him answered/in turn // swift-footed/divine Achilles." Let us not say that it is a mere epic equivalent to "Achilles replied." Let us not explain it away by pointing to the metrical convenience of the final noun epithet phrase. Note rather how form and meaning blend in its movement. We have an unfolding moment. The initial act ("answered") fills us with anticipation, we half-know what comes next, and the hero's resounding name takes its place at the end fulfilling our expectation. There is aesthetic pleasure in this sense of fulfillment, in so realizing the completion of form and attaining the final crowning touch. The lightness of an act merges with the agent's presence, it is as if the moment of speech took body. The reverse order would hardly have the same effect: we should have an initial name with its epithet quite deprived of any anticipating force, followed by any narrative addition of verb or predicate. This is why we never have such an order wher ever sentence and verse coincide (such a verse as, e.g., I?tjXe??tj? ?' 'AxiIe?? ajiafiEi?o^iEVOc jtqooeeijte never occurs). A casual, easygoing narrative would not proceed in this man ner. It would have a flimsy "Achilles replied," "he replied," or else it would digress, telling us perhaps what was Achilles' mood while speaking. Homer would not do so. His style is one with poetic focus. Thus the full-blown form of the noun-epithet phrase is not a decorative appendage but a necessary outlet to the preceding act. Its very weight is filled with silent action.</page></plain_text>
