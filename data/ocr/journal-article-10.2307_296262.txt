<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCIENT ITALY AND MODERN BORNEO: A STUDY IN COMPARATIVE CULTURE.' By W. WARDE FOWLER. The valuable work of Messrs. Hose &amp; McDougall on the ' Pagan Tribes of Borneo ' was published in 1912, and contains an account of the methods of divination practised by some of these peoples. In compiling it the authors had been led to consult Smith's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, so striking did the parallelism appear between the augural practices of Borneo and those of ancient Italy. And they were not mistaken; the parallelism is even stronger than they suspected, and induced me to write a notice of the book in the Journa1 o/ Roman Studies, in order to call the attention of students to the subject.2 Since then I have again gone carefully through the work, and noted a number of other points in which the habits of the one people remind me of the other. It seems worth while to bring these together. But before doing this, I must profess myself both unable and unwilling to theorise on comparative evidence of this kind. These singular analogies may arise naturally from the fact that those tribes of Borneo are now in much the same state of culture as were the earliest Latin settlers and their ancestors of the pile-dwellings and terremare of northern Italy. 3 It is primarily on these earlier stages of Italian life, incidentally on the more advanced civilisation of early Latium, that the Kayans and Kenyahs of Borneo may possibly throw some light. Into the question of race I am quite incom- petent to enter; but two points may be here notice"d as bearing on the problem : (i) there is now practically no doubt that the pile-dwellers and terremare folk of northern Italy came into that country from the north, and mainly from the valley of the Danube, 4 to which they may probably have found their way from central Asia, (2) the Kayans are probably in part of Caucasian blood, and are believed to have found their way to Borneo from central Asia 1 Read to the Oxford Anthropological Society, April, I9I5. 2_7.R.S. ii (I9i2), p. z69f. 3 For example, the Kayans, etc. live chiefly by agriculture, but they also keep domestic arimals, particularly the pig (the favourite sacrifice), and they hunt wild animals, pigs, deer, etc. See Hose and McDougall, chs. vi and ix. That the peoples of the pile-dwellings and terremare were in much the same condition as regards their food is proved by the remains of it which have been found. Seeds of cultivated plants have been discovered among the earliest of these settlements, and the people seem to have become more agricultural as the settlements became more permanent. They had domesticated the pig, but continued to hunt it in its wild form. In the terremare we find evidence of distinct advance on the same lines: the people practised agriculture more elaborately, but had not ceased to be hunters.

The Kayans and Kenyahs live in what may roughly be called village communities, on the banks of rivers, and usually, like the Etruscans, at points where the river forms an angle or where a tributary joins it. These village communities consist of one or more house communities, each containing some forty or fifty families. The house is practically a pile-dwelling, built not in the water, like most of those of northern Italy before the age of terremare, but not more than twenty or thirty yards above it. The shape of the house is rectangular, but its length is much greater than its breadth; it is placed upon piles driven into the ground, and at a height sufficient for security against enemies. The whole length of the house is about 200 yards, and the breadth from 40 to 6o feet: in front a gallery for common use runs along the whole length, with doors opening into rooms behind appropriated to individual families. 2 After reading the description of these curious ' long houses in the third and fourth chapters of Messrs. Hose and McDougall's work, it is interesting to turn to Mr. Peet's account of the pile- dwellings on the Italian lakes. 3 There we find evidence, slight indeed but complete so far as it goes, that here too the house was a long rectangular one, which must have contained many families (if families were there, as I suppose we may assume): but the breadth was greater in proportion than in Borneo. It would seem too that the house was not invariably built over the water, but sometimes in the peat which formed its shore4; and the facts seem to point to an advance from the lake-dwelling properly so called to the terramara or fortified position at some distance from the lake, though rarely far removed from water. Such a change also indicates an advance in civilisation, and security, and increased confidence in the good faith of neighbours; and it is perhaps here that we should place the first glimmerings of that famous 'ius fetiale,' common to the descendants of the terremare folk, 5 a most remarkable result of combined human interest and religious experience. I cannot, of course, prove this; but there are two facts, of very different kinds, which make the guess less hazardous. One is that in much the same stage of civilisation some Bornean chiefs had discovered, even before the arrival of direct European influence, that war and rapine, indulged in without warning given, in other I H. and McD. ii, 233.

I5 words, without something in the nature of a ' ius fetiale,' are not desirable. 1 The other fact is a curious archaeological one. The spear thrown into hostile country by the ' pater patratus ' under the fetial law was a survival from an age when iron was not in common use; Livy describes it (i, 32) as having a point either of iron or of wood hardened and sharpened in the fire and smeared with blood; i.e. iron was a late substitute for the old practice. Now in the period of the terremare iron had not yet mnade its appearance, and wood was sometimes used instead of bone or horn. Wood was occasionally hardened by burning in the age of the pile-dwellings: and the same practice is found in Borneo ; ' for the defence of a house short sharp stakes of split bamboo are thrust slantingly into the ground, so as to present the fire-hardened tip towards the feet of the coming foe.'2 Of the government of the old Italian long houses we of course know nothing ; but it is none the less interesting to examine that of the more advanced tribes in Borneo. Each house has a chief and, if there is more than one house in a village, the village has a chief ; but the most instructive fact is that the chiefs and their families form a social class like the patricians at the head of the community. 3 The members of this class rarely marry outside it, and special attention is paid to their methods of marriage, a fact which reminds us of the patrician confarreatio. Cohabitation of men of the upper class and women of that below is not unknown, but the men will eventually marry into their own class. The members of this upper class can be distinguished by the superiority of their personal appearance as well as bv their dress; but the origin of the class and its chieftainships does not seem to be known. They do not appear to be of different blood from the rest,4 though some of them claim divine descent, nor do they seem to have attained their position by skill in ' magic' ; there is nothing here to support Frazer's theory of the origin of kingship. The government of the chiefs has the three characteristic features of the old Roman kingship, i.e. they are leaders in war, in religion, and in the settlement of disputes and the punishment of the guilty. The moderation and good sense with which all this work is done, and the comparative absence of savagery and magic, suggest that the tendency we sometimes meet with to interpret Greek and Roman practices by reference to those of such primitive populations as the Australian aborigines, 1 H. and Mc.D. ii, p. 205-206. The policy was started among the Kenyahs before they were incorporated in the Raj of Sarawak. 2 See Peet, op. cit. 355, 297; H. and McD. i, I6I. For the practice of hardening wood in the fire see my Roman Festivals, p. 203, and Skutsch in Classical Quarterly, 19I0, p. 270. I find that it is familiar to anthropologists, and I have been shown spears thus hardened in the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford. For the smearing with blood, Prof. Reid sends me an interesting parallel in Ammian, xix) 2, 6 . 3 There are three classes in all: the lowest consists of slaves. mainly belonging to the upper class, and the middle class of all other members.

IO.</page><page sequence="4">i6 ANCIENT ITALY AND MODERN BORNEO: is apt to be misleading, and that there is need of more careful com- parative studv of peoples in a more advanced social condition. I may note in passing one or two other characteristics of these chiefs, which will further help us in forming an idea of the intellectual condition of the ancestors of the Latins. They have a natural gift for oratory, and frequently use it in their deliberations: and thev preserve the traditions of the history of their tribe, for at least several generations back. 1 How far they preserve them accurately we cannot tell; but the fact is worth noting just now, when there are signs that we are beginning to criticise the destructive criticism of the last century or so, which brushed away all old Italian tradition as worthless.2 It is as well to reflect that the members of the upper class, from which the chiefs were drawn, were both in Borneo and in Italy educated by their own experience and that of their ancestors ; they had religious, military and judicial duties to per- form, and in performing them must have learnt much. There is no sign in either country that they were intellectually petrified, merely the creatures of collective habit; there was room for individuality to ripen and fructify. As. Prof. Conway has lately said, the ' unknown Roman statesman who shaped the Roman constitution' is surely the great Valerius Publicola, if we are to treat tradition with any sort of respect. The reader of ' The Pagan tribes of Borneo,' and especially its twentieth chapter, will find such a chief as Publicola in Tama Bulan of the Kenyahs, not to speak of otlhers. 3 In writing of peoples of this stage of civilisation it is preposterous to talk of ' representations collectives ' or 'mentalit'e prelogique.' 4 At every turn we have the clearest evidence of individual character and its value. The functions of the chiefs in three departments, war, juris- diction (if I may use the word), and religion, may suggest a con- venient division of the rest of my subject-matter. Whatever is done of importance in these departments is done by the chiefs and members of their families, i.e. the upper class, as by the patricians in earliest Rome, who were doubtless the descendants of an upper class of chiefs and their families in the age of the pile- dwellings and the terremare. About the customs of war there is not much to say, but it is interesting to find that enlightened chiefs are gradually overcoming 1 H.&amp; cD. i, pp.63 and 68. Other points relating to the chiefs and their class will be mentioned below. A photograph of a chief haranguing his followers will be found opposite i, p. 70. 2 See e.g. Prof. Conway in Classical Review, 1914, p. 275. Of course in ancient Italy the great difficulty is to distinguish what is Greek in origin from genuine Italian tradition, and especially in matters of religion. In civil history and law we are rather better able to see through the mist. 3 Conway, loc. cit.; H. and McD. index, s.v. Tama Bulan. 4 Individuality is everywhere apparent in Hose and McDougall's book. Even dancing, which is so often represented nowadays as the result of ' collective mental action,' is often performed by a single person (e.g. ii, 157). For the 'mentalite prelogique,' etc. to which allusion is made above, see e.g. Levy-Bruhl, Les Fonctions mentales dans les societes primitives, chapter iv.</page><page sequence="5">A STUDY IN COMPARATIVE CULTURE. 17 the savagery of former years, and initiating a pacific policy destined to put an end to sudden raids, and so to set an example to modern Europe. 1 Nothing definite, however, in the nature of a ' ius fetiale ' seems as yet to have been noticed. Except in the matter of head- hunting, which seems not to have been an ancient practice of this people, and is now dying out, war is not accompanied by special cruelties among the higher tribes. Prisoners are eagerlv taken by the Kayans, and become slaves, but are kindly treated, and as in ancient Latium, often form a part of the family life. 2 It is curious to find the classical ' testudo ' in use among the Kayans. ' If a strong party determined to attack a house in face of an alert defence, they may attempt to storm it in broad daylight by forming several compact bodies of about twenty-five men. Each body protects itself with a roof of shields held closely together, and the several parties move quickly in upon the house simultaneously from different points, and attempt to carry it by assault.' 3 Compare the ' testudines ' as sculptured on the column of Marcus Aurelius, in Schreiber's Atlas of Classical Antiquities, plate 44, fig. 8. There is evidently a certain kind of sacredness (for want of a better word) about warfare among the Bornean tribes, especially at its commencement the warriors are subject to strict taboos throughout the raid or campaign. Two of these show that curious instinct for avoiding new things and adhering to old ones, which is familiar to all students of old Italian religion; they inust use only their home-made earthen pots, and fire must only be made by friction. 5 They were clearly thought to be in a ' holy' or dangerous state, a belief which might easily be illustrated from other parts of the world, and which has been fully dealt with by Sir J. G. Frazer in 'The Golden Bough.'6 But the most curious ceremony is that which the men who are to take part in the actual attack undergo. Some distance from the village to be attacked ' two solid platforms are built about twenty feet apart, and a large beam is laid from one to the other. The chiefs and principal men take their seats on the platforms, and then every man of the party in turn approaches this beam, the fighting leader coming first. If he is willing to go through with the business, he slashes a chip from the beam with his parang and passes under it. On the far side of the beam stands a chief holding a large frond of fern, and as each man passes under, he gives him a bit of the leaf.' 7 The magic properties of fern are well known, 8 and here probably the idea is that some special protection would be gained by carrying it about the person. 1 H. and McD. ii, Z05. 2 ibid. i, 184.

The following sentences may help us to realise the conditions of social life in a Latin community like early Rome, where the basic principle of justice lay beyond all doubt in the minds of the people, that is, of the upper class, known to us in Rome as patricians. 'The principle of collective or communal responsibility of the household (i.e. of the ' long house '), which is thus recognised in face of the spiritual powers, as well as in face of other communities, gives every man an interest in the good behaviour of his fellows, and at the same time develops in him the sense of obligation towards his com- munity. The small size of each community, its separation and clear demarcation by its residence under a single roof, its subordination to a single chief, and its perpetual rivalry and conflict with other neighbouring communities of similar constitution, all these circumstances also make strongly for the development in its 'ibid. pt. vii, vol. ii, I89 f. 2 Class. Rev. I913, p. 48 f; cf. G.B. pt. vii, vol. ii, 193 f. 3 See Domaszewski, Abhandlungen, p. 222: he seems to guess that the army originally passed out under this arch, and later on, after the building of the ' Servian ' wall, by the Porta Carmentalis (cf. the story of the Fabii, Ov. Fasti, ii, 201; Liv. ii, 49: 'infelici uia, dextro iano portae Car- mentalis profecti ad Cremeram flumen perveniunt'). Dom. as usual gets out of his depth here, but his main suggestion is worth attending to. This porta had two iani or passages (Wissowa, RK. ed. 2, p. 104), and so had the lanus Quirinus or lanus bifrons. Is it possible that this feature had some relation to the exit and return of an army ? Note that according to Wissowa this is the real meaning of the term Ianus geminus, the double head being now proved to be later. I find an interesting fact from India bearing on this matter: ' In northern India it is a common charm to drive the cattle under a rope fixed over the village cattle- path, and among the Dravidians of Mirzapur two poles and a crossbar are fixed at the entrance of the village with the same object, i.e. to protect them against disease.' etc. (Crooke, Folklore of Northern India, ii, 299). 4 H. and McD. at the beginning of ch. xx.

I9 members of a strong collective consciousness, that is to say, of a clear consciousness of the community and of his place within it, and a strong sentiment of attachment to it.'1 The authors add that a member can hardly leave the community even if he would: lhe would be an outcast, without helm or sail, and he would find it almost impossible to gain admittance to any other community. 2 All these facts explain 'how smoothly the internal life of the community generally runs, how few serious offences are committed, how few are the quarrels, or the instances of insubordination towards the chief, and how tact and good sense can rule the house without inflicting any other punishment than fines and compensatory payments.' And the same class of facts, if we think of them as existing in early Latium, will help to explain the nature of the authority of the paterfamilias, and of that higher form of the same broadly based authority, conferred by the patrician body, which we know as that of the Rex. There are, however, occasionally serious crimes, breaches of taboo, the most dreaded of which is incest, and these are held to bring grave peril to the house, and danger to the crop of padi. 3 The same feeling can be recognised in early Rome in the belief that crime disturbed or violated the ' pax deorum,' and that the deity concerned would punish the comr munity unless some expiatory step were taken to re-establish the right relation between the human and divine inhabitants of the city. 4 At Rome this was done by making over the criminal, the man who had broken taboo, as ' sacer ' (cursed and consecrated) to the deity whose special rights he had violated, with the result that any one might put him to death who was so disposed. 5 At this point we find a remarkable similarity of feeling among the two peoples with whom we are concerned, in the dislike of shedding blood even in these cases of punishment for sinful crime. I have noticed this in my paper on the original meaning of the word ' sacer ': the harvest thief is hung; the man who had suffered ' consecratio capitis et bonorum' might be thrown from the Tarpeian rock; the guilty vestal was buried alive ; and the 'parricida ' was sewn up in a sack and cast into the water. For incest in Borneo the usual punishment is, strangely enough, also to shut up the offenders in a wicker cage and to throw them into the river.6 This is a substitute for an older punishment which involved the shedding of blood, for this was felt to be the blood of the commnunity. It may be that the strength of communal feeling, which was extremely strong in ancient Italy, may there also help to explain the intense dislike of shedding human blood, either in punishment or sacrifice 'ibid. p. 194f. 2 In early Italy this was not so, as Prof. Reid reminds me; the provisions for a ius exilii were already elaborate. 3 H. and McD. ii, x96. 4 Religiouts Experience o/ the Romans, p. 272 f. a See 7.R.S. i (I9II), p. 59. 6 H. and McD. ii, I96.</page><page sequence="8">20 ANCIENT ITALY AND MODERN BORNEO : or in the two combined. The idea that the blood of the individual is the blood of the community has been long familiar to us.1 In Borneo even the process of cupping, which involves some loss of blood, has to be atoned for by some offering made to the patient by the surgeon. Kayans have no scruple in shedding the blood of their enemies, but they rarely go to war with other Kayans: and the shedding of Kayan blood by Kayans is of rare occurrence. To shed human blood, even that of an enemy, in the house, is against custom. 2 I now turn to the subject of religion proper, where our com- parison is in some points of remarkable interest. In writing of the religion of the early Romans I have insisted that their beliefs must be considered as essentially animistic 3; and that, though showing traces of the survival of ideas which Mr. Marett has described as animatistic, they were on their way to develop something in the nature of deity out of their world of spiritual agents. The Romans in fact were fairly well advanced in their conception of the supernatural. The same is the case with the Kavans and Kenyahs of Borneo. ' They mav be said to attribute a soul or spirit to almost every natural agent and to all living things, and they pay special regard to those that seem most capable of affecting their welfare for good or evil. They feel themselves to be surrounded on all sides by spiritual powers, which appear to them to be concentrated in those objects to which their attention is directed by practical needs . . . we may say that thev have differentiated from a continuum of spiritual powers a number of spiritual agents with very different degrees of definiteness. Of these the less important are very vaguely con- ceived, but are regarded as being able to bring harm to men, who must therefore avoid giving offence to them, if they should by ill-chance have been offended. The more important, assumning individualised and anthropomorphic forms and definite functions, receive proper names, are in some cases represented bv rude images, and become the recipients of prayer and sacrifice.' 4 This language might be used with little alteration of the earliest Roman religion as I have described it in my sixth Gifford lecture; and that description may gain some force from the comparison with another people not so far behind the earlv Latins in general culture. Life, soul, power, animation, or whatever we choose to call it, is the essential characteristic of the spirits of the Kayans and Kenyahs, as it was of the old Roman 'numina ' 5: and inanimate objects were not supposed to be endowed with such powers by either people. There is no true worship of stocks and stones. Before every Kayan I See e.g. Robertson Smith, Religiotn of the Semites, p. 254 f. 2 H. and McD. ii, I99. 3 See Religious Experience of the Romans, ch. vi. 4 H. and McD. ii, 2, note. o ibid. p. 3; Rel.

' But the post cannot be called an idol: it is more of the nature of an altar.' Perhaps the faint traces that we find at Rome of a tendency to make images of a deity, e.g. Pales, 1 should be explained in this way: as I wrote of them some years ago, ' it is hardly safe to take them as genuine examples of iconic worship.' Or the stone of Terminus may be compared with these curious objects (survivals from a pre- animistic age, or an age of animatism, as Mr. Marett calls it); whether any spirit or ' numen ' was thought actually to be resident in the stone, may be doubtful, yet that stone was also in some sense an altar, as is shown by the fact that when first set up as a boundary- mark it was sprinkled with blood and adorned with garlands.2 In one point, which is of importance in estimating the process of the development of deity out of a vague world of spirits, the religion of the Kayans and that of the Romans are strongly contrasted. The former have no priesthood; not even in their chiefs do we see the characteristics of the true priest. Neither have they permanent temples, which are usually found in conjunction with a priesthood. The fact seems to be that priesthood arises where there is a fixed and permanent settlement on the land, and where a 'numen' or deity is caught and isolated on a particular spot,-which becomes his own property, and so needs an agent or official. 3 The Romans and their Latin cousins were beginning to be definitely settled when we first catch a vague glimpse of them: Latium had at least some com- munities that we may call cities, of which the sites were never afterwards changed, nor the habitations of their deities. But the Borneo tribes are more in the condition of the pile-dwellers of the Italian lakes; their houses and villages, though often unchanged for long periods, are not as yet bound to the soil by any passionate regard for it. This is probably the reason why priest and temple are not found among them in any true sense of the words; and this makes it seem strange that they should lhave got as far as they have in the direction of anthropomorphic deity. But this may be the result of contact with other peoples. Though the process of god-development is of some interest to us, it is hardly so with the gods thus developed. There is one, Laki Tenangan, who seems to be in some sort a supreme and intertribal deity; but little is knoWn of him, and that little does not show any real analogy with Zeus or Jupiter. 4 He is not a god of the sky, nor of the thunder; but his title Laki seems to answer to the Graeco-Roman use of the word father, as applied to deities, I Rel.

On the other hand, the great mass of spiritual beings, the Toh, are thought of as hostile to mankind. They are wild and have not been reclaimed : but ' those of the locality in which a man dwells are regarded by him as less dangerous than those of other parts: for experience has shown him that in the neighbourhood of his own village he may behave in certain ways with impunity, whereas in distant regions all is uncertain.' 2 This is simply the feeling of ' religio,' gradually soothed away in settled habitations, but recurring as they are left further and further belhind, e.g. by an army, as I have described it more than once in my Gifford lectures. 3 Nothing can show more conclusively the importance of permanent settlement in the mental development of mankind. This is illustrated too in one detail which reminds us of the early Latin settler. In clearing a patch of jungle for sowing padi, a few trees are usually left standing on some high point of the ground, in order not to offend the Toh of the locality, who are believed to use them as resting-places.4 We may aptly compare this with the instructions given by Cato to the Latin farmer for making a new clearing; he is to offer sacrifice and to pray the unknown spirits of the wood or trees to excuse the liberty he is taking: and when he proceeds to dig the ground, he is to take further steps to set himself right with the spirits. 5 Midway between the gods and the Toh are spirits of a higher order than the latter, i.e. those attached to men or animals, alive or dead; but they do not seem to throw any new light on ancestor w6rship or the idea of Genius, as we might have expected. True, the description given of the ' secret helper ' of an individual, which occurs mostly among the Sea-Dyaks, rarely among the tribes we are specially concerned with, is of great psychological interest ; but it does not seem as yet to be sufficiently investigated to enable us to compare it with familiar Greek and Roman beliefs. 6 The most instructive point about it is perhaps the strong proof contained in it of the development of the individual as distinct from the group. I proceed in the last place -to consider the system of divination among the Kayans and Kenyahs, which affords such striking points of comparison with that of the Romans and Etruscans that it caused I H. and McD. ii, 6, where thisis proved by refer- ence to the sacrifice and prayer offered to this god. 2 ibid. ii, 25. 3 Rel.

They suggest, though with all due caution, that the two systems had a common root: that ' while the Aryans carried the system westward into Europe, the Indonesians, or some Caucasic people that has been merged in the Indonesian stock, carried it eastward.' 1 The bird whose flight is most important in augury is a hawk (Haliastur intermedius). In the work we are examining (ii, 52) is a most interesting account of the way in which this bird is consulted. A party of Kenyahs under Tama Bulan are about to undertake a journey, with the object of making peace with another tribe. The record is in the form of a diary, and thewriter very naturally remarks at the end that he felt as if he had just lived through a book of the Aeneid. After the chief had been purified with water and the blood of pigs, three men of the upper class-patricians in fact, who alone can take the auspices 2 sat under an extempore shelter and searched the sky for hawks. After a while they caught sight of a hawk high up and far away, and began to try and persuade it to fly towards the right. This they luckilv accomplished; then they settled down to watch for another that should fly towards the left, and a third which should circle round and round. ' In about half an hour two hawks had obligingly put in an appearance, and behaved just as it was hoped thev would behave; and so this part of the business was finished.' What followed, i.e. sacrifice and prayer, also has its interest for us. Tarna Bulan, though a trifle unwilling to perform these ancient rites, nevertheless had to act in a priestly capacity, like the Roman rex: he sprinkled on the congregation the blood of the victims (a practice obsolete in historical Rome), and recited a prayer in a rapid murmur, like the priests of Iguvium (tacitus precator). 3 ' Meanwhile four boys were pounding at two big drums to keep away from the worshippers all sounds but the words of their own prayers.' So at Rome the priest covered his head with his toga, and tibicines played all the time in order that no unlucky sound or word might be heard which would make it necessary to start afresh with a new victim. Here the Borneo practice seems useful in dissuading us from abandoning this old interpretation of the veiled head in favour of one of which the Romans themselves knew nothing at all, viz. that it was a sign of separation and consecration. 4 A stili more remarkable parallel with Roman custom is the consultation of Bali Flaki, the divine hawk, before sowing and har- vesting the rice crop. 5 On some quiet spot by the river bank, what I ibid. ii, 255. 2 Rel.

The augur lights a small fire beside the 'tegulun,' and sits on the ground behind it, so as to see through it a square patch of sky, and waits until a hawk becomes visible on this patch. When the hawk becomes ivisible he waves it towards the left: for he knows that if it flies towards the left he will prevail over his enemy, but that if it goes to the right his enemy is too strong for him. Here we plainly have the old Italian ' templum' of augury, the rectangular space marked out by the 'lituus,' within which birds might be observedl; and here too we find the rule which both in Borneo and in Italy applied to some birds though not to all, that the left was the auspicious side. Then again we have ' oscines ' as well as ' alites,' e.g. the woodpecker has two notes, one of which is lucky, the other unlucky. 2 If the augur has secured good omens from other birds, his men will avoid hearing the woodpecker by singing and rattling their paddles on the side of the boat, which seems to savour of Roman ways, if it cannot be exactly paralleled at Rome. We may remember that the famous Marcellus of the second Punic war used to ride in his litter with the blinds drawn down, so that he should not see anything of evil omen. 3 The method of divination by examination of a victim's liver is also of great interest for students of old Italian religion. The sacrifice of a pig, the commonest victim, is always accompanied by such an examination, and Messrs. Hose and McDougall have given us a photograph of two Kayans in the act of inspection.4 It does not appear that they are trained experts, like the haruspices; but these were the result of a long period of development, and we have to look for a closer parallel in the earliest form of the religion of Rome, before the Etruscans had passed on their elaborate code of doctrine to the Roman augurs. 5 As in early Rome, the livel was marked out in certain divisions. ' The rule generally followed is to identify the under surface of the right lobe with the territory 1 The templum was a rectangular space, of which the frame, so to speak, was an imaginary one but I suspect that it was originally the space visible from the door or opening in the operator's taber- naculum, which would naturally be a rectangular one; cf. von Jhering, Evoltution of tbe Aryan (Eng. trans.), p. 364. 2 H. and McD. ii, 59. At Rome there were many minutiae in the doctrine of omens from oscines: here too the Black Woodpecker (Picus Martius) was an important bird in augury. Festus (Lindsay), p. 214. On the subject generally, see Bouche-Leclercq, Hist. de Divination, vol. iv, 99 f. 3 Cic. Div. ii, 36, 77. 4 vol. ii, p. 8o. 5 Wissowa maintains (RK. ed. 2, p. 41.8 f.) that the Romans did not examine the entrails with a view to divination, except to see whether the god would accept the victim, till they learnt the art from the Etruscans ; but I do not feel quite convinced on this point. (Wissowa states the same view in his article on Roman divination in Hastings' Encycl. vol. iv, p. 824.) The ap- pearance of the liver seems everywhere to have been looked on as a message from the deity; what that message was, whether simply approval of the victim or communication of a more detailed character, is difficult to determine in each case. Some good remarks on this subject, based chiefly on Thulin op. cit. will be found in Mr. Holloway's Divination in Greece, p. I92 f.</page><page sequence="13">A STUDY IN COMPARATIVE CULTURE. 25 of the party that kills the pig and makes the enquiry; the adjacent part of the left lobe with the territory of any party involved in the question, which adjoins that of the first party; and the under surface of the caudal extremity with that of any remoter third party.' It is interesting to note that the omens thus obtained are held to be the answer of the god to the prayers carried to him by the spirit of the pig ; and also that the killing of a pig is always the occasion for, or occasioned by, some religious rite, and even if the occasion is not primarily a religious one, the victim is invariably charged with a message to a god. 1 We do not find here any system so highly elaborated as that of the Etruscans, illustrated as it now is by the famous bronze liver of Piacenza, as well as by the work of Martianus Capella, and indeed now also by our knowledge of the Babylonian science of hepato- scopy. 2 But the method of dividing the surface of the liver is the same in principle in both systems, though the Etruscans divided their livers into seats of deities instead of into territories belonging to the parties in a quarrel: and the Borneans seem to be in a fair way of developing their methods with something like Etruscan extravagance. On the whole we find an extraordinary growth of this pseudo-science in distant Borneo, in Babylonia, and in ancient Italy, such as is not found, so far as I know, in any other part of the world. What conclusions, if any, are to be drawn from this I will not attempt to guess, unless it be to suggest that we are to see in the mental build of these three peoples, or the upper classes among them, considerable resemblance to each other. In conclusion I will add two or three points of some interest which have not been noticed in this paper so far: i. Marriage. The ceremony is described as a blending of symbolical capture with actual purchase (ii, 174). In the Roman ceremony these two elements are also to be traced as survivals. The subject is too elaborate for me to dwell on it here : but see my I H. and McD. ii, 64. The authors seem to have no doubt about this; the message is carried, they say, by the spirit of the pig. But this purpose of sacrifice is rare, so far as I know. It is found in connexion with human sacrifice in Greece, but not in Italy. There is the famous case of the Getae in Thrace, who sent a messenger by sacrifice every five years to their god Zalmoxis, telling him what they were in need of (Herodotus, iv, 94) and Herodotus tells us that they expected to go to this god themselves after death. Again in Euripides (Hec. 422-3), Polyxena, about to be sacrificed, asks what message she is to bear from Hecuba to Priam and Hector: which according to Mr. Lawson (Modern Greek Folklore, etc. 340 a-id 346), who found the same idea in the island of Santorin surviving at the present day, was no mere poetic conceit, but a feature of the popular religion. Lastly, in Aen. ii, 547 (also quoted by Mr. Lawson),, Pyrrhus makes Priam a messenger at the moment of his slaughter: ' referes ergo haec et nuntius ibis. Pelidae genitori.' It seems not unnatural that. the idea should spring up in connexion with human sacrifice, but I do not find it associated with ordinary animal sacrifice: is it possible that in Borneo it may be a late interpretation of animal sacrifice combined with prayer, and with the answer of the god in the liver of the sacrificed victim ? Messrs. Hubert et Mauss in their essay on Sacrifice (Melanges d'histoire des Religions) do not reach this view, though once or twice they approach it, e.g. on p. 124. 2 Thulin, Martianus Capella und das Leber von Piacenza, p. 7; Hastings' Encvcl. of Religion and Ethics, vol. iv, p. 784.</page><page sequence="14">z6 ANCIENT ITALY AND MODERN BORNEO. article on Roman Marriage in Hastings' Encycl. of Religion and Ethics. 1 2. Initiation at puberty. There is no elaboration of ceremony for this purpose in Borneo, as among the Australians and other primitive peoples, and (according to Miss Harrison) among the Greeks.2 At Rome too we know of no such practice, unless the change of toga can be regarded as a survival of it. 3. Mythology. Though the Kayans, etc., are fond of stories, and possess a mythological instinct, their myths, like those of ancient Italy, have little or no relation to religion and the gods. 3 Roman divine myths are of Greek origin: the Borneans have none, properly so called. 4. Magic. 'The Kayans dislike and discourage all magical practices, with the exception of those which are publicly practised for beneficent purposes, and have the sanction of custom. In the old days they used to kill those suspected of working evil by magic. There are no recognised magicians among them.' 4 The same dislike is a characteristic of Roman life, where magic was excluded from state ritual except in the form of meaningless survivals, and practised privately under precautions taken by the state. See my Roman Religious Experience, 49 and 107 (cf. index s.v. Magic). 5. The intimate relation (a quasi-religious one) of Bornean women to the seed-corn and its growth, and in fact to all agricultural operations, finds illustration rather in Greece than in Italy, 5 but -we may aptly remember that the deities of Italian agriculture were mostly female, Tellus, Ceres, Pales, Ops, Vesta, Feronia (probably), Venus, Flora, and Pomona: a fact not without bearing on the question. In historical Rome the women did not work in the fields, as in Borneo, but the idea of a close connexion between that sex and the fruitfulness of grain seems to have survived in these female deities. 1 In the Roman ceremony we have the simulated rape of the bride at the deductio, the parting of her hair with a spear, and the lifting her over the threshold of the bridegroom's house, together with the legend of the rape of the Sabines. For the similar rites of the upper class among the Kayans, H. and McD. ii, 172 f. But there is no actual trace of exogamy among either people, apart from these forms, which may be explained, as Mr. Crawley first showed us, in quite a different way. See his Mystic Rose, p. 3so f. There was, of course, no actual purchase at Rome, but the form of coemptio may suggest that it was in use at some remote time, though personally I doubt this: see my article on Roman Marriage in Hastings, Encycl. of Rel. and Eth. vol. 8. 2 See her Themis, chapter i and elsewhere. 3 H. and McD. ii, 136 f. 4ibid. ii,II 5f. 5ibid. i, uII. Here we are in touch with the idea of the vital principle in the seed, which is carried over from one harvest to another through the seed-corn, and is, so to speak, immortal. It may be at the root of many practices still here and there surviving, as I have suggested in my paper Mundus Pate, 7.R.S. ii (1911), p. 25.</page></plain_text>
