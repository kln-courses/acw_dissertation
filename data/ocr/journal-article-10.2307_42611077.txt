<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMADVERSIONES An Unattested " Scribal Correction " in Numbers 26,59? Eighteen onDio mpn in the Hebrew Scriptures are cited by several rab- binical authorities - never any larger number but also no explicit state- ment that the enumerated corrections are the only ones^). It is reasonable to infer that our sources would have mentioned other corrections if they had been aware of any. This information about the eighteen is on the fringe of the Massorah; for it does not affect our canonical text as it is written - i.e. the letters that it consists of - nor as it is read - i.e. the tradition of how to pronounce it. But it does throw some light upon the pre-canonical state of the text, at least in these few passages; and that has drawn some extraordinary attention. The eighteen cited instances differ of course from one another; but they have this in common: they all involve minimal alteration of the pre-existent letters. Thus, (1) suppression of one letter in Job 7,20, instead of ybv : "Why have you set me as a target for you? and I have become a burden upon myself [instead of upon you , i.e. God] " (similarly in Lam 3,20); (2) transposition of two letters in 2 Sam 20,1, vVhnV instead of ttiVnV ; "We have no part in David, and we have no heritage in Jesse's son; everyone to his (own) tents [instead of to his (own) god' , O Israel" (similarly in 1 Kgs 12,16, 2 Chr 10,16); (3) substitution of one letter in Zech 2,12, irr instead of ts; : "the one who touches you is touching the ball of his eye [instead of my eye , i.e. God's]" (similarly Hab 1,12, etc.). Most of the eighteen originally involved even less change than the terms transposition and substitution suggest; for they could be made by adding a stroke to a letter or erasing just a part of another. Through they substantially affect the meaning, they were otherwise but little different from what an ancient Hebrew scribe used to do in the course of restoring an old, faded copy; for many letters had become illegible, or nearly so. Furthermore, while reading the text over, reading it intelligently and knowing it well, he was bound to come across actual mistakes that demanded correction. That, as I envisage it, is what set the stage for these (*) See C.D. Ginsburg, Introduction to the Massoretico-critical Edition of the Hebrew Bible (repr. with Prolegomenon by H. M. Orlinsky; New York 1966) 347-363, and my book, The Father of Joshua! Jesus (Binghamton 1978) 70-107. The present article owes much to my friend John Pairman Brown, as I read him my handwritten draft and he commented on it page by page.</page><page sequence="2">26 Saul Levin essentially ideological "corrections", where a word such as Ttt 'my eye' (in Zech 2,12) was so offensive to the scribe's piety and at the same time so easy to change into something innocuous. Now the retouching or reinking of faded scrolls of the Torah continues to this day; for as long as the parchment itself is not in tatters, that makes better sense than commissioning a new copy: not only does it save money - it is also less prone to casual errors. However, the rabbinically trained scribes have long since lost any authority to change even one letter, except to correct a deviation from the Massorah. A few of the eighteen involve more than the very minimum of transposition or substitution, notably in Gen 18,22, 44 And Abraham (orna«) was still standing before the Lord (mm)" instead of th£ converse, and in Job 32,3, " And he [Elihu] was angry at his [Job's] three friends, because they did not find an answer, and they placed the guilt on Job ( av« ) " probably instead of mm . But even so the number of letters remains the same, and as much as possible the very same letters were still used. The scribe who introduced what has become the canonical text could have imagined that he was only correcting his predecessor's carelessness. Most scholars who have studied the onsno mpn in recent times believe that there must be considerably more than the eighteen mentioned in the traditional lists. It is necessary, however, to distinguish the truly scribal "corrections" from the more independent editorial variants or changes, perpetrated by men to whom the pre-existent letters of the text were no constraint p). The best-documented "scribal correction", apart from the eighteen, is in Deut 32,8, V«*w instead of d'TiVn : " When the Most High parceled out nations, when he split up the sons of man, he fixed the boundaries of peoples to the number of the sons of Israel [instead of God or perhaps gods]". An ancient fragment found near the Dead Sea reveals the letters D-n1?« in this verse (*), and it makes excellent sense philologically, whereas stultified the meaning to remove what had come to sound blasphemous. But it is still a five-letter word, with three of the same letters as ; and thus it is of a piece with the eighteen attested "scribal corrections One of the eighteen, however, in Num 12,12, has gotten rid of a blasphemy (so to speak) not against God but against Moses or his family: "let her [Miriam] not be like the dead [still-born] in whose coming out of the womb of its mother ( i»« ) [instead of is»« 4 our mother '] its flesh ( rwa ) [instead of mwa 'her flesh'] was half-eaten". The first (*) C. McCarthy, The Tiqqune Sopherim and Other Theological Corrections in the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament (Freiburg Schweiz 1981), figures that although our rabbinical and Massoretic sources had indeed heard of ansio mpn carried out in antiquity - i.e. before their own time - they were wrong about nearly all the instances of such onoio -iipn that they cited. She accepts only the ones in Zech 2,12; 1 Sam 3,13 and Job 7,20. But it is not justified to set up criteria which, in effect, invalidate the bulk of the primary evidence, instead of using each piece of evidence fully for whatever it is worth. (*) See P. W. Skehan, " Qumran and the Present State of Old Testament Text Studies: The Masoretic Text", JBL 78 (1959) 21.</page><page sequence="3">An Unattested " Scribal Correction " in Numbers 26,59? 27 " correction " is as reported in the rabbinical lists, the second as implied by the early Greek translation (commonly known as the Septuagint): tôv aapKcòv aòxfjç. This makes much better sense than mM 4 our flesh' which the rabbinical sources give as a thoughtless counterpart (so it would seem) to iïôn 4 our mother '. That brings me to the discovery of what really lies behind the canonical nriN in Num 26,59, Q?^öa nñfc rnV; "wn "iVña Vaov'Jo- chebed, Levi's daughter, whom she [J. 's unnamed mother] bore to Levi in Egypt'. The subject of the verb rnV is unexpressed and not to be supplied from the context, while the object pronoun nñN is weak and redundant, though grammatically possible. To that extent it is already like a typical "scribal correction". Moreover, the Septuagint has IcoxaP£ö Guyátrip A ein fi 8X8K8V toútouç ici) Aeuï èv 'AiyÙTCTû) 'Jochebed, Levi's daughter, who bore these to Levi in Egypt'. The demonstrative toútouç presupposes nbn in the Hebrew, certainly not nnx (4). But the only grammatical antecedent for toútouç in the previous context is the three names Teòawv, KaãO, and Mepapï in 26,57; and that would entail the grotesquely incestuous corollary that she was not only the aunt of her husband Amram (Exod 6,20) but his grandmother too. For ('A|ip&lt;x|i) in 26,58 is the son of ñnp (KaäO). When I first noticed this discrepancy between the preserved Hebrew and Greek texts of Numbers, I thought that here is another instance of the translator faithfully reflecting the sense - however outrageous - of the pre-canonical Hebrew (5). It seemed to be confirmed by rabbinical exegesis of Exod 2,1 ff., which makes out Jochebed to have been preternaturally old when as Amram's wife she bore Moses (6). But as I see it now, if there was a real connection between that rabbinical exegesis and toútouç in the Greek of Num 26,59, what the two have in common must have been based on the same mistake in vocalizing the three-letter word nVx of the pre-canonical Hebrew textf7). (4) onK would be a conceivable alternative to nVx ; but normally nnx evoked the non-demonstrative referential pronoun aÒTOÚç 'them' (e.g. Gen 1,27). (5) The Samaritan Hebrew Pentateuch agrees here with the Massoretic text, as it does on the rabbinically attested oneio "Jipn (Gen 18,22; Num 11,15; 12,12) and on Deut 32,8. The Targum Onqelos nrf riT1?-! also agrees with nñk rnV "wk . (6) höw 12a, mna Naa 119b-120a. See my article, "Jocasta and Moses' Mother Jochebed", Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Boiotian Anti- quities , Supplement 2 to Teiresias (1979) 60. Í7) Another motive for the rabbinical Midrash about her age could have been to reconcile the chronology of Israel's sojourn in Egypt, which lasted four hundred and thirty years according to Exod 12,40 - making a very long time between the grandfather Levi and the grandsons Aaron and Moses. In any case, neither the Hebrew nor the Greek text supports the idea of some modern commentators that ro was not intended literally as 4 Levi's daughter ' but - more loosely - a female descendant of Levi. For that interpretation would make the word (a little later in the verse) all the more incongruous, as though someone bore offspring to Levi not in the years directly following his migration to Egypt but one or more generations after that.</page><page sequence="4">28 Saul Levin If vocalized nVtf and accordingly taken to mean 'these', the word as object of the verb ought to be preceded by the particle rm in normal prose syntax (®). That argument against the vocalization nVx is not in itself conclusive; but having Levi's three sons born in Egypt involves a contradiction with Gen 46,8.11, which counts them among those who moved to Egypt during the great famine. A much more satisfactory interpretation of n*7N as a feminine noun , identifying the mother, is suggested by Ruth 4,12, rrnrrj? pi 'Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah'. For immediate cogency, the parallel gains enormously because in both passages the subject of the verb rnV - i.e. the mother - has the name of a kind of tree, and a prestigious tree at that: nipr&gt; means 4 Palm ', n1?« 4 Oak ' (or some other majestic kind). Levi and Judah are brothers, both of them prominent among the sons of Leah. Of the other ten sons of Jacob by his wives and concubines, only one wife is identified by name: Joseph's wife Asenath, daughter of the Egyptian priest Poti-phera (Gen 41,45). Simeon, another son of Leah, had one of his sons by a Canaanite woman (46,10), whose name and status are not given. The genealogical tradition that got incorporated in the Scriptures did not, on the whole, preserve information about the women who fall into the category of mothers of the sons of the twelve patriarchs. Not all of them were wives. Gen 38 is careful to explain how it was with Judah: his wife, the daughter of Shua, died, having borne three sons; and after two of the three died childless while married to Tamar, Judah was lured into a transitory mating with her at a place called trra 'Twin Springs', and she bore him twins named Perez and Zerah. Why should something about nbn , the mate or wife of Levi, have survived into the pre-canonical text of the Pentateuch, while nothing parallel was preserved about the mate or wife of the other eight patriarchs of that generation? Well, the Pentateuch goes into more detail about the genealogy of the tribe of Levi; so this particular detail stood a better chance. The passage near the end of Ruth shows beautifully the Sitz im Leben for the transmission of some mothers' names from the distant past: The elders and all the people of Bethlehem, witnessing Boaz's declaration of marriage, say, " The Lord make the woman that comes to your house like Rachel and Leah, who between them built the house of Israel, and may you prosper in Ephratha and gain renown in Bethlehem, and your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, from the seed that the Lord shall give you from this girl" (4,11-12). In each tribe, no doubt, there was a motive, on the occasion of a wedding, to recall not only the patriarch but the wife or wives who had borne him sons. Understandably, though not inevitably, the motive at a wedding would have been somewhat weaker if the women to hark back to had been mere concubines. But on the other hand the mysterious Tamar, though not exactly Judah's wife, was still an ancestress worth celebrating. (®) Cf. Gen 46,18.25: ffrx-m iVm</page><page sequence="5">An Unattested " Scribal Correction " in Numbers 26,59? 29 A remarkable negative fact concerns all twelve sons of Jacob: unlike their father, their grandfather Isaac and their great-grandfather Abraham, none of the twelve is mentioned as having married within their kindred f). To put it mildly, the Pentateuch does not show unmixed pride in the wives - or whatever - through whom the twelve sons of Jacob procreated. Yet neither are any of those women censured, unlike his brother Esau's wives, the Hittite women who turned out to be a "vexation of spirit" not only to their mother-in-law Rebecca but also to their father-in-law Isaac (Gen 26,34-35; 27,46). After all, the nation of Israel looked back to the twelve sons of Jacob or Israel; and if the womenfolk of that generation did not enhance the standing of their descendants, then - as the English byword puts it - the less said about them, the better. I would scarcely entertain the opposite interpretation, that in the absence of some specific mention to the contrary it could be taken for granted that they were all daughters of the stock of Abraham or his kin. Unmistakably, some things to the discredit of the twelve - and, for that matter, of the great men and women before them and after them - were well known and had to find a place in the books that recorded for all posterity their essential actions. They were involved in rivalries, some quite bitter, that left a permanent mark on their reputations, so that those who had a grudge against them - and those who afterwards inherited such a grudge - would not willingly let it be forgotten. The most that a writer could do, if fundamentally interested in the truth but not impartial, was to include palliative details, where he was aware of them, and to leave out many minor points i10). For no book could take in all or most of what an author had ever been told by anyone about a subject with endless ramifications, such as the genealogy of the Israelites. The subsequent rabbinical Midrash is far more one-sided than the ancient Scriptures, whose purpose - so far as we can define it - was to preserve from oblivion whatever was of enduring import from the standpoint of national education. What are we then to make of the notice about Jochebed, that she was born in Egypt and her mother was nVx - a point distorted in the Greek by a mistranslation and obscured in the canonical Hebrew by what I diagnose as a " scribal correction "? Juxtaposing the two mothers - -inn the mother of Perez and Zerah, and the mother of Jochebed - I detect a strain of tradition much racier than the general run of biblical marriages. These two names hint at O According to the pseudepigraphic Testament of Levi (11,1) the name of his wife, who bore his sons, was That is the same as Nahor's wife, Abram's sister-in-law (Gen 11,29; in Hebrew letters hd1??? ). The author of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs may have been suggesting that Levi's wife was from within the family. Q°) Examples of palliative details, in Gen 38, are that Judah did not realize he was lying with his own daughter-in-law, since she was disguised; and that she, in turn, had been driven to this deception by his bad faith in withholding his youngest son Shelah from her; and that this too - his fear lest Shelah die after marrying her - was natural enough since it had happened to his two older sons.</page><page sequence="6">30 Saul Levin something other than merely a foreign bride of this or that kind(n). Feminine names that refer primarily to certain trees evoke, rather, some extravagant myth of blessed motherhood, surpassing any human fruitful- ness. The sons of , Perez and Zerah, account for the multiplication of the tribe of Judah, which soon outnumbered any of the other tribes (Num 1,26-27; 2,3-31; 26,5-51). Levi too - although cursed by Jacob (Gen 34,30; 49,5-7) and the poorest, least cohesive of the tribes, with the possible exception of Simeon, who was cursed along with him - nevertheless throve in a way, through hVk and her daughter Jochebed, born in Egypt. The place is no irrelevant detail; for the fertility of that land amazed and attracted the peoples of nearby Asia. The Bible is replete with warnings to counteract the lure of Egypt. The narrative in Genesis, as well as the continuation in Exodus, serves to forestall any supposition that Abram or Jacob or Joseph went there voluntarily to seek his fortune; instead they left the promised land under dire constraint (*2). Abram - and later Jacob's posterity under Moses - came out of there enriched indeed (Gen 12,10-20; Exod 3,21-22; 12,35-36); but this is all explained away as if it had come to pass paradoxically, through quirks of circumstance, rather than by latching on to the opportunities in a great and prosperous country and thus building up a considerable amount of wealth. While Israel as a whole multiplied undeniably in Egypt, it was there that the tribe of Levi found its peculiar greatness, which began with the birth of Jochebed (*3). The name nSx , furthermore, was open to interpretation as the feminine of Vn 'god'. That some speakers of the language associated divinity with the tree itself, is all too clear from the prophet EzekieFs denunciation: " And you shall know that I am the Lord when their slain ones are amidst their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountain tops, and under every shady - wherever they have given propitiatory scent to all their idols" (ö,^)^4). The outright meaning (n) The book of Ruth demonstrates how, under odd circumstances, an upstanding Israelite family intermarried with the Moabites, a people of notoriously incestuous origin (Gen 19,30-37), although the author of Ruth discreetly makes no mention of that. (12) That the promised land was very liable to famine, mainly because ot scanty, irregular rainfall, was an inescapable fact of geography. The book of Deuteronomy puts the best face on it, so as to inculcate dependence upon God and obedience to his commandments. See J. P. Brown, "Men of the Land and the God of Justice in Greece and Israel", Z AW 95 (1983) 379-382. Í13) The birth - also in Egypt - of Joseph's sons, Manasseh and especially Ephraim, foreshadowed their ascent to become tribes recognised along with those which went back to Jacob's sons. Ephraim eventually surpassed most of the tribes: Joshua was an Ephraimite, and so were the kings of Israel from Jeroboam on, after the death of Solomon.

On the other hand, èXàïT] - which looks like a derivative from the Hebrew construct form (unattested) or from a dialect such as Phoenician with the absolute form ròx - means 'fir'. The place-name (1 Kgs 9,26, on the Red Sea, *)*&gt;"&amp; ) is morphologically the plural of this Hebrew noun, as if such trees were growing there; however, in 2 Kgs 14,22 it is ñ^K (on which the modern spelling Éilat is based).</page><page sequence="7">An Unattested "Scribal Correction" in Numbers 26,59? 31 'goddess', an anthropomorphic personality of female sex, is quotable only in modern Hebrew O5). But nStf is plainly cognate to the Phoenician and Punic jV?n , the Ugaritic (///), and the Akkadian ( i/eltu[m ]) (construct (i/elat), which do mean 'goddess' indubitably. So, upon reading or hearing about this nV« who bore Jochebed, anyone among the ancient Hebrews who was inclined toward polytheism, or anyone among the neighboring peoples who shared the same or nearly the same language with them, would readily take the word to mean 'a goddess', i.e. a common noun without the prefixed definite article O6). To a scribe like the reformer Ezra, or following him, such an interpretation must have seemed incompatible with the Mosaic religion; and it was easy to eliminate by changing one letter V to n . I would not go on to reconstruct a story about Levi and nVx , on the model of Judah and Tamar. That is too venturesome, as we lack the salient traits to "flesh out" the relationship between Jochebed's father and mother. The author of Num 26,59, or his immediate source (whether oral or written) for the genealogical facts, may have had access to much more about this couple than we are told; but if so, the information, with whatever admixture of fancy, was lost beyond retrieval. The most obvious instance of an Israelite whose mother was a goddess is the warrior ñhrja *TOtf(Judg 3,31; 5,6). How this metronymic, a vestige of polytheism, escaped the hands of all revisers and correctors, can only be a matter of speculation. One possibility is that rijy ceased rather early to be recognised as a divine name. We know all about her, thanks to the rediscovery of the Ugaritic texts, supplemented by some in neighboring languages; but for a long time ito in the Bible was mistaken for the father of Shamgar O7). Textual critics before me have proposed to emend nriN in Num 26,59 to HöK 'her mother 'i18), which does not change the substance at all but only the verbal expression.

Kittel and his collaborators established a bad policy of not stating who should be credited (or in some cases blamed) for each emendation; and just as in critical editions of the Greek or Latin classics, they adhered to the bad practice of not explaining why an emendation is called for, nor even telling where to look up a discussion of it.</page><page sequence="8">32 Saul Levin rnV; gives no information beyond what is already implicit in the verb and the gender of laDV . Moreover, this emendation is obliged to presume something accidental: that an illegible a (whether in the same lettering familiar to us or in the earlier angular lettering) was mistaken for n in one text tradition, but for b in another tradition that the Greek translation was based on. A double misreading of the supposed middle letter ö is inherently less probable than a motivated "correction" of the b (in nVx), which must be the Hebrew behind the Greek translation toútouç (*9). As I have pointed out earlier, this unattested "scribal correction" in Num 26,59 pertains to the same person, Jochebed, and the same Levitical family as the attested one in Num 12,12, while the other seventeen attested "scribal corrections" pertain to the majestý of God. So if we treat nnK too as a " scribal correction ", we bridge the ideological gulf between those seventeen and the one in Num 12,12. For Num 26,59 deals with Jochebed, and at the same time nnx instead of nb« got rid of an explicitly or at least implicitly polytheistic word p0). Besides the stillborn child in Num 12,12, where Miriam's leprosy reminds Aaron of that family grief in the past and he appeals to Moses on behalf of their suffering sister, Moses himself was impaired by a speech defect of " uncircumcised lips" (Exod 4,10; 6,12.30) - which hints or implies that he had been misbegotten (cf. John 9,2) - and that is not all. He never married an Israelite woman; even after his marriage to Zipporah the Midianite ended under obscure circumstances, he took a Cushite wife - to the unconcealed chagrin of Miriam and Aaron (Num 12,1). Indeed, much of the book of Numbers deals with the shakiness of Moses' high position - defamed by his own brother and sister, let down by ten of the twelve spies he sent into the promised land and disobeyed by the whole host of Israel, and finally insulted, along with Aaron, by their cousin Korah and his adherents: "That's enough; for the whole community, all of them, are holy, and the Lord is in their midst. Why do you set yourselves above the Lord's congregation?" (16,3). The ascendancy of Jochebed's sons rankled, although it had been conferred on them by the Lord. Korah felt that he and the rest of the Israelites were just as good, if not better i21). Í19) Still less likely would be two quite separate misreadings of höh in different ancient manuscripts, from one of which nnx was miscopied, and from the other ri1?«. f20) Formerly, in "Greek Occupational Terms with Semitic Counterparts , The First LACUS Forum 1974 , 246-252, when I considered toútouç for ròx to represent a valid vocalization, I accordingly envisaged a sexual union between yowkébed and lewiv, parallel to the marriage between 'IoKáaTTi and Aáioç (♦Aáfioç); see above, note 6. I would now explicitly withdraw that interpretation of Num 26,59. p1) In spite of the hideous destruction of Korah and his faction (Num 16,28-35), the "sons of Korah" lived on to sing many a psalm (42; 44-49; 84; 85; 87; 88). So their ancestor's claim to equality with Aaron, while never approved, was in some fashion settled eventually with a compromise that afforded them a certain distinction.</page><page sequence="9">An Unattested " Scribal Correction " in Numbers 26,59? 33 My book, The Father of Joshua / Jesus (published in 1978), brought out a recurrent but unattested "scribal correction": the patronymic ju p instead of mnn , which is recoverable from the Greek rendering uíòç Naufj. NATH in Greek letters was a transcription (rather than a translation) of the Hebrew divine name, modified phonetically by proximity to the nasal consonant in [bin]. In preparing that book, I studied intently the eighteen attested onsio "Npn , together with any other likely ones that came to my notice. Now I am ready to add this one more - nn« instead of nbx - which has something in common semantically with ju p 'son of N.' instead of 4 son of the Lord': The Hebrew, as it was before 4 4 correction expressed or at any rate suggested divine sexuality, a God or a goddess active in the procreation of a great man or a great woman, srcnrr is the first man's name mentioned in the Scriptures that contains the Tetragrammaton in its reduced three-letter form - if we put aside the morphologically problematical name rnirr . The hero-to-be received this name wirr from Moses, according to Num 13,16, not from his Ephraimite family. It can hardly be by accident that likewise Moses' mother iibv , whose name is told in Exod 6,20 as well as Num 26,59, was the first woman in the Scriptures to have the divine name - in reduced form - constituting one element of her own name. When we stop to think, so strikingly original a twist in naming is quite in character with the total originality of Moses himself, who - for all his trials, weaknesses, and vicissitudes - was the one that heard and transmitted the mightiest words of the Lord. And Moses, in a mysterious and yet natural way, inherited this supremely favored originality from his mother rather than from his father, who - on the record - was a cipher remembered only for having taken his aunt Jochebed to wife. Ezra and the whole line of scribes exerted themselves scrupulously to protect and teach Moses' legacy to Israel. But their " corrections " overscrupulously took away a small part of the legacy, which is now worth our while to reclaim by searching high and low. The nature of such a search ought to preclude one kind of misrepresentation of the outcome: an unattested on did ppn , however convincingly demonstrated, cannot pass for a philological fact - namely, that this is flatly what the text said before it got distorted. We have achieved, rather, a restoration in the sense of a more coherent and plausible interpretation of the data than any other that has been proposed. Certainly it is better than either acquiescing in the muddled canonical text of Num 26,59 or just giving up on it, or settling for the incongruous reading of the Septuagint. Intuition or common sense must warn us that scarcely any genealogical author would ever make a woman out to be her husband's grandmother. The restoration of as Jochebed's mother puts us on the threshold, at least, of a realm where mythical and even polytheistic motifs shaped genealogical traditions and touched the central personages in the religion of Israel.
