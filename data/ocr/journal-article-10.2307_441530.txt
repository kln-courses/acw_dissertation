<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Walking to Sleep" and Richard Wilbur's Quest for a Rational Imagination PHILIP WHITE Richard Wilbur once suggested that much of his poetry could be understood as a "public quarrel with the aesthetics of Edgar Allan Poe" (Responses 125), with Wilbur advocating a poetic of rationality, order, balance, and commitment to others and to the natural world, and Poe promoting an aesthetic in which according to Wilbur the poet's "only means of escape" from a "fallen planet" is "a deliberate retreat from the temporal, rational, Physical world into the visionary depths of his mind" (49). At stake here we see not just a mere quibble between two isolated poets, but some of the crucial questions of modern poetry concerning the relationships between spirit and flesh, idea and thing, self and other, aestheticism and didacticism, surrealism and realism, dream and rational consciousness-in short, between the imagination and what Wallace Stevens called the "pressure of reality" ("Noble" 3-36).1 What Poe's aesthetic stands for in Wilbur's mind is a complete commitment to the first element in all these dichotomies to the utter exclusion of the second. Wilbur, on the other hand, is an inveterate dualist. His world is typically a "manichee hell of twilight" (351), a middle state in which one must keep a "difficult balance" between opposing ideals (234). Since reality is inescapably dual, to pursue any ideal to absolute purity represents either a hubris of the imagination-a "Thule of the mind's worst vanity" (313)-or a wistful and potentially psychotic attempt to escape reality by denying one aspect of it. But Wilbur himself is not immune to the temptation to use poetry as an escape. By his own admission he started to write poetry seriously 249</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE as a response to his military experiences in the Second World War, and at the same time he found in the writings of Poe a distraction from the horrors around him (Kunitz 1080; see also Broughton 149-50). An early poem suggests with some humor that the modern sense of the unreal, chaotic, nightmarish quality of the real world is a state to which Wilbur is highly susceptible, one which has become, as the title indicates, "A Chronic Condition" (275). The threat of this unsettling state of mind is a constant presence in Wilbur's poetry and poetic, and Edward Butscher has correctly sensed "a recurrent dread of inheriting a strain of insanity" in Wilbur's works (66). Wilbur's "quarrel" is therefore not so much with Poe as with the very real part of himself that, dismayed by the horrors of the modern world, would seek to escape from it by means of the imagination.2 However, the correct function of poetry, Wilbur holds, is not to remove oneself from an undesirable reality, or to indulge in anguished, unmediated expression of that reality-a practice which he obliquely attributes to confessional poets.3 Rather, poetry exists to give us some way of ordering that personal or general "cataclysm" or "Chaos," a means of "organizing oneself and the world" (Kunitz 1080). Of his first poems Wilbur says that they "helped [him], as poems should, to take ahold of raw events and convert them, provisionally, into experience" ("On My Own Work," Responses 118). A poem for Wilbur is thus what Robert Frost, Wilbur's most important mentor, called a "clarification of life ... , a momentary stay against confusion" (Frost Selected 18). But Wilbur's unfailing achievement of some kind of rational balance in every poem has itself seemed evasive or easy to critics who are skeptical of reason and imposed order or who prefer poetry to reflect an alienated self and a world in disarray. Certainly, Wilbur is both less inclined to speak directly about personal suffering and more inclined to rationally accept the world as it is than most of his contemporaries are, but his poetry is not by any means devoid of suffering and awareness of tragedy. Wilbur does not "rail at the world" as one critic would have him do,4 but he does acknowledge and take a stand toward death and the difficulties of the human condition. In his best and most important poems, the internal struggle between the Poe-like aestheticist desire to escape the threat of chaos by retreating "into the visionary depths of [the] mind" and the Frostean need to establish order is fully and dramatically worked through, and a real sense of urgency in both impulses can be felt. In such poems we sense not only the achievement of order, but also the provisional and often vulnerable state of that order.5 250</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD WILBUR This is particularly true of the complex poem "Walking to Sleep," which depicts a journey through a menacing landscape suggestive of modern experience, in which the speaker/guide passes through two distinct modes of response toward the world.6 In the first section the poet is paranoid, almost psychotic, and he proceeds by willful negation and autocratic subjectivity, leaving the actual world and stepping into the "blank of [the] mind" (158). In the second section the relationship between the imagination and reality is characterized by love and a radical and painful acceptance of and openness to the world and to others. In the course of the poem Wilbur not only does battle with the spirit of Poe but also invokes and revises or rejects such poets as Wordsworth, Frost, Eliot, and Stevens in his essentially modernistic quest for an adequate imaginative response to contemporary experi- ence. The most obvious of these predecessors is Frost. The way Wilbur's speaker takes the role of a quirky guide for some kind of quest for one's true "waters and resting place" is obviously designed to recall Frost's great poem "Directive" (Poetry 377-79).7 But where Frost's poet/guide seems confident and ultimately affirmative, Wilbur's guide of the first section proceeds by disconcerting and contradictory negations, warn- ings, random "suggestions" which one can "take or leave," and an irritatingly noncommittal diffidence. And while Frost's poem suggests that by means of the imagination one can leave "all this now too much for us" (377), drink of the life-giving waters, and "be whole again beyond confusion" (379),8 the first part of "Walking to Sleep" shows an embattled imagination leading one on a "pointless journey" toward "cloacal" waters full of "crumbling tufa" and, finally, toward death (160). The poem is thus what Harold Bloom would call a romantic "crisis poem," for in Wilbur's revision of "Directive" the imagination has lost faith in its own powers to organize or make sense of a world. While the world that Frost's guide directs us through has a kind of cohesion because it presents a stable and single (if radically reduced) landscape, Wilbur's guide leads us through an apparently arbitrary series of hallucinatory images without any grounding in a world outside "the blank of [the] mind." We are taken into a solipsistic realm in which "what you project / Is what you will perceive" (158), and, since perception in this frame of mind is not verifiable by reference to a stable external reality and is not ordered by the imagination, one must muddle through a state of consciousness so arbitrary and chaotic that it can be described as "without transition" or as "pure transition" with 251</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE equal accuracy. Thus in one remarkably unstable passage a "gritty cellar" unaccountably emerges in "some cathedral's pillared crypt," which then becomes a mine shaft, which in turn gives on to either an Egyptian pyramid or a "vacant barracks" (159-60). In this respect the vision of the first section is closer to that of The Waste Land than that of "Directive": the threat of insanity and chaos is just as menacing, and the imagery itself frequently recalls Eliot's poem,9 though Wilbur's speaker at this point seems even less able to "set [his] lands in order" than Eliot's speaker (Eliot 69). Wilbur's seamless syntax conceals a vision as fragmentary as Eliot's, and the result is a postmodern poetry that would read somewhat like John Ashbery,'1 except that the presence of the guide figure establishes a degree of continuity and provides a dramatic perspective on the disconcertingly "abrupt structure" that "involves" us (159). It is in the voice of the guide that the spirit of Frost survives, albeit drastically attenuated, in this wasteland-a spirit that in spite of being beset by self-doubt and existential dread, still seeks some kind of clarification or order, no matter how ineffectual or reduced. It is helpful to view this Frostean guide as a character who is trying out a postmodern way of looking at experience, and whose obsessive concern and images reveal how we are to judge him and his way of approaching reality. The first thing we notice is that although the guide often begins with some confidence and authority, even conjuring up such pleasant images as "tussocks or a dusty flower" and "dolphins playing in the bow-wave" (158), he quickly falls into irresolution and paranoid warnings against too wistful imaginings: All such suggestions Are yours to take or leave, but hear this warning: Let them not be too velvet green, the fields Which the deft needle of your eye appoints, Nor the old farm past which you make your way Too shady-linteled, too instinct with home. (158) Later in the section his advice is to Avoid the pleasant room Where someone, smiling to herself, has placed A bowl of yellow freesias. Do not let The thought of her in yellow, lithe and sleek As lemonwood, mislead you where the curtains, Romping like spinnakers which taste the wind, Bellying out and lifting till the sill Has shipped a drench of sunlight, then subsiding, Both warm and cool the love-bed. (160) 252</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD WILBUR Freud held that there is no "no" in the unconscious, that when a person negates or denies a thought that occurs to him, it is a sign that he cannot accept the contents of the thought, or can only admit them into consciousness in the form of a denial, and certainly something like this is going on in Wilbur's poem. The irony of the guide's warnings and prohibitions is that they reveal the repressed exuberance of his imagination. The ideal images of home, beautiful country, happiness, and domestic and romantic love are both his desire and his dread. They are what he is inclined to imagine, but what he must abjure because "what you perceive / With any passion, be it love or terror, / May take on whims and powers of its own" (158), and because by making such "dear acceptances" (160) he risks inevitable loss and change. Accepting these desires and wishes would mean being subject to their rising and falling, the warming and the cooling of the love-bed. But, perhaps more important, by giving himself passionately to what he perceived, the speaker would risk losing control over it, and control is of utmost importance to him. The first lines of the poem invoke the figures of a queen and a general, both of whom are in positions of command and act with the expectation that reality will follow their whims. The related image of the "Potemkin barn [from which] there comes / The trotting cat whose head is but a skull" refers to Potemkin's subversive deceptions of the queen of Russia (see Michelson 85). Thus the threat of the homey farm with the velvet green fields is that it might prove illusionary, that it might in fact conceal a menacing reality. Instead of pursuing these fields the speaker advocates imagining a bleaker reality, a landscape made safe by radical and militant negativity. The word he uses to describe this scene is "champaign," (158) which even in English still resonates with its older French meaning of a battlefield, and the guide's description of this "landscape not worth looking at" (158) is as a decimated territory into which the speaker has penetrated, blasting any rock or tree that might conceal an enemy. The military terminology continues in the next lines, as the speaker advises one to schizophrenically "Detach some portion of your thought to guard / The outside of the building" (159). The imagery of paranoid authority culminates in the final lines of this section in which Sleep is seen as a "kind assassin" that will "draw a bead / And blow your brains out" (160). There is an element of relief in this death image, for by eliminating any passionate acceptance of beauty, home, or love, and at the same time blasting anything that might threaten him, the speaker has painted a picture of a life so dismal and meaningless that the only possible hope is for death which is at once 253</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE a "kind" release and a violent consummation of his most intense fear. It is almost irresistible to psychoanalyze the speaker of this section, for his imaginative response to experience is characterized by an almost pathological repression and avoidance, and he embodies what Freud called the death drive, which is both aggressively self-defensive and self-annihilating and which strives for the ultimate repose or security in death or nonexistence. 2 The striking thing about this section of the poem is Wilbur's collocation of this destructive tendency with some of the imaginative modes of important modern and postmodern poets. We have already seen how the ordering spirit of Frost in the figure of the guide struggles with the despairing and solipsistic vision of early Eliot, but the lengthy description of the "bleak / Champaign at dead November's end" which we "must manage ... to bring to mind" also recalls Stevens's "The Snow Man" and the "mind of winter" which one must have in order not to feel an anthropomorphic "misery" in the wind (Collected 9-10).13 In a rather bland echo of the Stevensian spirit of negation, Wilbur's speaker here advocates a "numb and grudging circumspection" or a "glance of flat indifference." Moreover, in Wilbur's poem the rejection of romance in the figure of the "love-bed" and the woman with flowers also seems reminiscent of the bitterness of the last two parts of Steven's "Comedian as the Letter C" in which marriage, sexuality, family, and home seem to compromise Crispin's quest as a radical realist for the "fecund minimum," a place and mindset devoid of illusion. Wilbur's conclusion of the first section of his poem is also similar to Steven's close, in which Crispin appears as "variable, obscure, / Glozing his life with after-shining flicks, / Illuminating, from a fancy gorged / By apparition, plain and common things.... And so distorting, proving what he proves / Is nothing." And just as Sleep/Death is in Wilbur a "kind assassin" which relieves the speaker from meaninglessness, so death arrives in Stevens: "what can all this matter since / The relation comes, benignly, to its end?" (Wilbur 160, Stevens Collected 39-46; emphasis mine). Thus Wilbur invokes the specter of Stevens in a seemingly pathological context-though, to be sure, it is Stevens in one of his deepest crises-and what Wilbur seems to be suggesting is that the radical negation of Stevensian realism partakes at its extreme of the drive toward self-destructive dehumaniza- tion. This perhaps confirms Bloom's assessment of Freud's conception of this drive as being "Romantically based" (Bloom 403-05), and, interestingly, the beginning of this first section also calls to mind the 254</page><page sequence="7">RICHARD WILBUR Mount Snowdon episode in the climatic last book of The Prelude, the quintessential Romantic epic. Here Wordsworth, after trudging through a sea of "dripping fog" and seeing or hearing "nothing" that jars him from his "private thoughts" (14.11-20), finally notices at his feet "a silent sea of hoary mist, / A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved" (14.42-45).14 By comparison here is Wilbur's passage: Step off assuredly into the blank of your own mind. Something will come to you. Although at first You nod through nothing like a fogbound prow, Gravel will breed in the margins of your gaze ... And, humped like dolphins playing in the bow-wave, Hills will suggest themselves. (158) On the surface this passage presents Wilbur's common idea that it is impossible to imagine for long the nothingness of sleep or death or negation without something coming to mind, but it is also important to recognize that Wordsworth's and Wilbur's images both derive ultimately from Milton's passage on the creation in the seventh book of Paradise Lost,15 and that both replace a creative act of God with an act of the poetical imagination. The difference is that Wordsworth is looking at actual fog and his conceptions are admittedly related to the creative power of God, whereas everything in this section of "Walking to Sleep" is purely in the speaker's mind. Bruce Michelson has pointed out that Wilbur's passage beginning "What you project / Is what you will perceive" alludes to similar ideas in Wordworth's "Tintern Abbey," and his point seems valid that Wilbur's poem is a caution against Wordsworth's "optimism" about the imagination, or rather against that form of the romantic imagination which has degenerated into solipsism by cutting or disavowing its Wordsworthian "anchor" in "nature and the language of the sense" (86).16 In the same light, if Wilbur's earlier passage, like Wordsworth's, is indeed an attempt to place the imaginative act alongside original creation, it is meant to highlight the presumption inherent in such a comparison and to make us question all that follows in the first section of the poem because it implicitly leaves God's world and occurs completely in the mind. The first section, then, echoes and imitates various romantic and modernist poets in such a way as to call into question solipsistic premises and trends within their poetics. The first lines of the second section of "Walking to Sleep" appear to abandon entirely the whole method and approach of the first section: What, are you still awake? Then you must risk another tack and footing. 255</page><page sequence="8">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE Forget what I have said. Open your eyes To the good blackness not of your room alone But of the sky you trust is over it Whose stars, though foundering in the time to come, Bequeath us constantly a jetsam beauty. (160) The speaker thus turns away from the "blank of the mind" and opens his eyes to the external physical world. While in the first section of the poem he has been overly cautious, here he counsels risk-taking and trust, and where he has previously dismissed beauty, he urges us here to accept the blackness of night as "good" and to admire the beauty of the stars. Not only should one accept "blossom-fall," "honeyed meadows," and the "thrush's quirky glee" but one should also accept such negative realities as "flak in air," the "barren bark of winter," and the "laden gallows tree." (161)17 The second section of the poem, then, presents an antidote or at least an alternative to the "drugged" malaise of the first section,18 and the language and imagery are highly suggestive of a Christian outlook. Early on there is the explicit reference to the biblical story in which Jesus sleeps below deck during a storm "on wild Gennesaret" and is awakened in order to calm it (King James Bible, Matthew 8.23-27), but there are more subtle biblical echoes as well. The phrasing of the lines "Be led past honeyed meadows which might tempt / A wolf to graze" (161) is, for example, reminiscent of that in both the twenty-third Psalm and in some of the messianic chapters of Isaiah.19 The gallows at the crossroads is also suggestive of the crucifixion. In each case these biblical images reflect back on and counter images in the first section. Jesus's calm reac- tion to the storm "of all things" upon the "flung skiff" corrects the solip- sistic nodding "through nothing like a fog-bound prow" in the first sec- tion. The "honeyed meadows" of millennial peace past which we are to be led in the second section both correspond to the "velvet green" field which we have been told earlier to avoid and also contrast with the war-riddled "bleak Champaign" which we were told we must manage to keep in mind, the attitude of submission replacing that of suspicion and exertion of willful control. The military figures which are predominantly aggressive, authoritarian, and paranoid in the first section now expose themselves to "flak" and are pictured in the terms of Christian chivalry: "long errantry perhaps / Will arm you to be gentle." Similarly, the man on the gallows whom we are to recognize as our "brother" (161) corresponds to the image of death (the "trotting cat") (160) which we were told earlier to fear, and likewise contrasts with the "known stranger" (159) whom we were told to "put a stop" to. Whereas the first section presents a purely subjective 256</page><page sequence="9">RICHARD WILBUR play of images, the second refers to the world whose stars "bequeath us constantly a jetsam beauty" (160, emphasis mine). The corrective that the second section offers is thus an opening outward, a submission to otherness rather than solipsistic evasion of the world, and a relinquishing of control in an acceptance of the "strong dream by which [one] has been chosen" (161). This, as we have seen, is no easy or painless task, for it requires one to confront death, suffering, and one's "dearest horror" squarely and still keep striding forward, accepting and loving the world as it is. Anyone familiar with Wilbur's Collected Poems will recognize this response to experience as typical Wilbur, and indeed the Frostean voice of the guide which all but collapsed under the weight of self-doubt and chaos in the first section seems more confidently assimilated into Wilbur's in the second. Like "Directive," then, Wilbur's poem concludes with the possibility of a kind of epiphany, that "if you are in luck, you may be granted, / As, inland, one can sometimes smell the sea" (161), and this is itself a direct echo of the following lines of Wordsworth's "Intimations of Immortality" ode: "in a season of calm weather / Though inland far we be, / Our souls have sight of that immortal sea / Which brought us hither" (Selected 107, 11. 162-65). Earlier in the ode Wordsworth extols the child's "obstinate questionings / Of sense and outward things" (11. 142-43) and it is the truths won by such questionings that he recalls here. The second section of "Walking to Sleep" follows a similar progression, from a persistent and sometimes difficult and painful confrontation with the outward world to a moment of epiphany, or to return to Frost's terms, a "clarification of life." The epiphany occurs in an explicit recognition that we are participants in a larger dream that has "chosen" us. The odd phrasing here echoes both Jesus's words to his disciples ("You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you" [John 15.16]) and Wordsworth's affirmation of the existence of "higher minds" who are able to reach a vision of "the consciousness / Of Whom they are (Prelude 14.90, 144-45, emphasis mine). But if the final epiphany is introduced as Wordswor- thian and Christian, its actual imagery is a conflation of details from several Eastern myths found in the Mahabharata and elsewhere.20 It appears in the unexpected and remarkable final lines as A moment's perfect carelessness, in which To stumble a few steps and sink to sleep In the same clearing where, in the old story, A holy man discovered Vishnu sleeping, Wrapped in his maya, dreaming by a pool 257</page><page sequence="10">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE On whose calm face all images whatever Lay clear, unfathomed, taken as they came. (161) The "old story" to which Wilbur refers involves a holy man or sage who wanders through the cosmic sea of destruction and nothingness in a period following one of the cyclical ends of the world and finally arrives at a calm place (Wilbur's "clearing") in which he sees Vishnu. This story presents a possible end to the nightmarish wandering of the poem and a redemption of the notion of external reality as meaningful, for Vishnu is, as Wilbur calls him in another poem, "The god who dreams us" ("In Limbo" 63-64): his maya is the magical power of illusion in which the god is "wrapped" (with the play on "rapt" as in a dream) as if within a veil or shroud, and from the human perspective it is essentially the illusion of the experienced world itself. Our reality is the dream of god. This double perspective echoes the Gennesaret image in which Jesus sleeps calmly through the storm "of all things" while the men on board are terrified. Jesus chastises them for fear and lack of faith in the face of the tempest, which was of course always in Jesus's power. This view of reality allows Wilbur to accept the world without trying to leave it behind as poets like Poe advocated, for he is able to admit the possibility that in the higher consciousness there is a meaning and order which Wilbur himself cannot always penetrate. Whereas in the first section the world was essentially the solipsistic dream of the poet/guide who like Poe's poet descends into the "visionary depths of his mind," in the second section the external world is seen as the dream of god, a dream which has chosen us and to which we should submit. The essentially Berkeleyan perspective of the second section thus explains how Wilbur can call the physical world "rational" (Responses 49) and also serves as the starting point for "The Mind Reader," Wilbur's next important crisis poem and the title poem of his next book.21 But while Wilbur returns frequently to the idea of reality as the dream of god, a closer reading of "Walking to Sleep" reveals that the vision of Vishnu is never actually attained. Like the concluding promise of renewal in "Directive," the vision at the end of "Walking to Sleep" exists only in the realm of poetry. The epiphany is held before us as merely an "old story," or, in the terminology of a later Wilbur poem, one of history's "great lies" that provide us with means of organizing our reality and establishing provisional relations with others and with the world itself (see Wilbur's poem "Lying" 9-11). The poetic implied here is in some ways parallel to Stevens' concept of "supreme fictions," in which religions, mythologies, and world views are considered as imaginatively constructed objects of belief rather than objective or 258</page><page sequence="11">RICHARD WILBUR universal truths. For both Wilbur and Stevens the imagination plays more of a psychological than a strictly cognitive role, but where Stevens tends to see the imagination as a countervailing force against "the pressure of reality," or in other words the "violence within that protects us from a violence without" ("Noble" 36), Wilbur sees the imagination's role as rational and mediatory, as an organizing of external reality, a conversion of the chaos of "raw events" into "experience" (Responses 118). thus, instead of seeking to protect us from the violence of external reality by asserting "a reality of its own" (Stevens "Three" 79), Wilbur's imagination submits itself to the real world: "Let all things storm your thought with the moiled flocking / Of startled rookeries, or flak in air" (161); and where for Stevens a supreme fiction must be "abstract" and should ultimately "propound" the "idea of man" as "the final elegance" (Collected 380-89), for Wilbur a poem should seek more to preserve contact with the concrete "things of this world" and to place humans in a position of humility and submission to the external reality (Collected 234).22 This characteristic Wilburnian position toward the world is not quite the easy evasion that some critics have made it out to be. After all, at the end of "Walking to Sleep" we are back "upon the roads again," and though our mode of consciousness has opened to the outer world, we may nevertheless end up seized in the "claws / Of nightmare," meeting our "dearest horror," never reaching the epiphany at all. It is, we should remember, only by "luck" that we may be granted the glimpse of Vishnu in the first place. Furthermore, the terms of Wilbur's epiphany, his Frostean "clarification of life," are not at all unambiguous. In fact, the state of utter clarity and complete receptivity to external reality suggested in the final image of the pool is, while beautiful, just as inhuman a condition as the first section's state of total negation, and Wilbur has portrayed a similar condition of absolute reflectiveness in a negative light in other poems (see "The Aspen and the Stream" 205 and "Clearness" 313). The second section ends, like the first, in an attempt to find an image of death that epitomizes an approach to living and, by extension, writing. Whereas the first section ends with the complete annihilation of mind and thus of any world constituted by it (the "kind assassin Sleep will draw a bead / And blow your brains out"), the second ends with an image of death as a dissolution of human consciousness into a mode of perception that reflects exactly the real world, the dream of god which it acknowledged even in life. Thus, although the pool image calls to mind the version of Christian afterlife in which the soul mirrors and worships God as the ultimate and only reality, it is also an 259</page><page sequence="12">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE image of the loss of individual perception and response. It is still a death. And any hope or consolation derived from viewing death in this way must moreover be tempered by the awareness that such a view is, in the end, only a fiction, an "old story." It is also important to recognize that the experience depicted in the second section of the poem is in its own way just as painful and nightmarish as that presented in the first. The second differs from the first only in that instead of responding to the external world by an ultimately psychotic attempt to escape from it, the imagination seeks to accept a world which in spite of its terrors is the world that has "chosen" us, that has made us what we are. This is, of course, a huge difference, but we should not let Wilbur's obvious commitment to the attitudes and stances characterized in the second section of the poem blind us to the complexity of his response and the reality of the temptations of solipsistic negation and insanity against which he struggles. If in Wilbur's poems the internal "quarrel" between the hubristic impulses of the imagination to assert itself as its own reality and the piety of an imagination that works within and acknowledges its dependence on the external world is predictably resolved on the side of piety, we should nevertheless acknowledge the psychological stakes of the quarrel and the importance of the debate within the context of mid-century modernist and postmodernist poetics. NOTES Though I believe Wilbur's poetry is inextricably locked into a position of opposition or response to modern poetical trends, it is typical of him to choose his opponents not from among his closer contemporaries but from earlier centuries-thus Wilbur says his "quarrel" is with Poe, when it seems more likely that he is attacking a strand of aestheticist solipsism that stems from Poe through the symbolists to the modernists and postmodernists. Inherent in this strategy, I think, is a kind of deflation of his opponents-as if they could be addressed by refuting or correcting a figure he perceives as their predecessor. The fact that Wilbur's philosophical frame of reference tends also to be located in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Berkeley and Samuel Johnson rather than Heidegger or Wittgenstein) suggests that Wilbur's mind is thoroughly and profoundly conservative. In defiance of certain modernist tendencies to see twentieth-century experience as somehow unprecedented or uniquely difficult, Wilbur insists that the problems confronted by a poet today are not much different from those faced by poets in earlier periods. 2 In this way what Wilbur says of Poe's poet is equally true of himself: "Poe's poet is thus at war with the external world. But he is also, unfortunately, at war within himself... [for] the poet's imagination must struggle not only against the mundane and physical world around him, but also against the mundane and 260</page><page sequence="13">RICHARD WILBUR physical aspects of his divided nature" (Responses 49). Wilbur has also said that the act of writing a poem is essentially the act of "getting one's selves to quarrel intelligibly in public" (Broughton 141), a statement that accounts for the debate structure that either overtly or implicitly underlies virtually all of Wilbur's poems-as if Wilbur could not write a poem on any topic without first conceiving a duality or conflict, an "I1 Penseroso" to answer every "L'Allegro." 3 See part 2 of "Flippancies" in New and Collected 90. 4 See Leibowitz 120-22. 5 There is, of course, a sense in which creating psychic order through poetic form is an escape, but in Wilbur's poetic it is an escape from the chaotic experience of the world, not an escape from the world itself. It plays a consolatory psychological role, rather than a cognitive one. The type of escapism that Wilbur struggles against and sees Poe's poetic as a paradigm of is inherent in the strand of romantic thought which posits the imagination as a faculty capable of achieving an insight or vision or form that is ontologically and epistemologically separate from and in some way superior to ordinary perception and experience. The symbolist movement and some varieties of romanticism, formalism, structuralism, and postmodernism partake to some degree of this line of thought and can trace their pedigree back to Coleridge, Poe, and ultimately Kant. The escape Wilbur attacks is the retreat into an aesthetic realm conceived as separate from and independent of the world. 6 Most critics who have discussed the poem at any length have either missed this bifurcation entirely or have given it little attention (see Michelson 83-90; Kinzie "The Cheshire" 17-20; Jensen 601-02; Taylor 97-98). But Wilbur himself has called attention to it (Jackson 144), and as I see the poem the distinction is of utmost importance: without it we miss Wilbur's basic ordering principle. 7 A remarkable number of Wilbur's poems are fairly obvious responses to the poems of other writers or are built on recognizable poetic topoi, and his commonsensical thoughts on the matter of "poetry's debts to poetry" are interestingly set out in essay of that title (Responses 161-84). In fact Wilbur's examination of Frost's "answer" to Shelley in "Birches" and of Frost's "tribute of resistance" to Beddoes in "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" has provided a model for the type of analysis that I will use in my discussion of Wilbur's own poem and its precursors (Responses 112-14, 182-84). Although I will cite Harold Bloom, it seems to me that Wilbur's conception of poetry as a form of essentially rational and public discourse makes the Bloomian question of "anxiety of influence" secondary to questions of content and execution. In a way, of course, Wilbur's view of poetry prevents him from being what Bloom would call a "strong" poet, but in Wilbur's mind a poet can be significant for treating a single theme in a powerful way. In his own highly allusive poetry, Wilbur is not trying to do something new so much as to do something well; he is not trying to go beyond what his precursors have done, but wants to engage them in a literary conversation. My aim in this essay is to reveal the themes and the terms of the debate. 8 Although there are other interpretations of "Directive," I see the poem as revolving around the possibilities, risks, and limitations of a kind of redemption of selfhood and order achieved by the imagination's creation of a self- consciously fictive form: the guide takes us through the waste and ruin of the 261</page><page sequence="14">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE past and leads us to the point where we can, if only in imagination-in the poem itself-fill our human need for meaning, refreshment, rest. For similar readings see Frank Lentricchia (112-19), for whom the poem's conclusion suggests that "imagination's journey is ended only when the projection of imagination's shapes of hope and desire is accompanied by a sober self-consciousness that will keep us in touch with ourselves and the limits of our redemption, and keep us from projecting fantasy worlds that will spurn the law of gravity and spur us into anarchic solipsism" (119). Richard Poirier also sees the poem as "an attempted journey to poetic and personal sources where a self can be discovered this side of heaven" (294-95). For the idea that the "salvation" of the poem is self-consciously "make believe," see Randall Jarrell (56-57), one of the poem's first admirers. 9 The most notable echo is perhaps the hallucinatory appearance of the "known stranger" which is remarkably similar to the appearance of Stetson in part one of The Waste Land (30) and the "stranger" that is "known, forgotten, half-recalled" in Eliot's Little Gidding (203). Wilbur uses a similar apparitional figure in the important later poem "The Mind Reader." 10 Mary Kinzie considers the disjunctive style of "Walking to Sleep" alongside both Eliot and Ashbery in "Irreference" 276-78, 281. I think Wilbur may have actually had an Ashberian poetic-either "pure transition" or "without transition"-in mind while writing this section. One senses that the concept of experience in Wilbur has not been so entirely replaced by the concept of text as it is in Ashbery. Wilbur's poems are full of the realization that "it was all a dream" (see for example "Digging for China" [256] or "Thyme Flowering among Rocks" [142], a realization which Ashbery draws explicitly into the realm of textuality at the end of "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror." This section of Wilbur's poem is perhaps a parody and critique of the closed circle of textual self-reference in Ashbery's poetic. I See "Negation" in Freud 666-69. 12 On the death drive, see Beyond the Pleasure Principle Freud 594-626. The cluster of symptoms describing the guide in this section-radical negation, autocratic aggression and control, and separation of intelligence from emotion, repression, paranoia-are often loosely grouped together in Freud's thought (see for example "Negation" 666-69 and Civilization and Its Discontents 722-72, both in Freud. 13 My reading of Stevens's poem takes its final line as an affirmation of "the nothing that is"-that is, an affirmation of a metaphysics of absence, not presence (Wilbur responds more directly to "The Snow Man" in "Boy at the Window" [Collected 267]). Wilbur, it seems to me, is one of the few poets of his period whose poetry, when pressed, implies a metaphysics of presence. 14 References to The Prelude are to book and line number of the 1850 version. 15 "Immediately the mountains huge appear / Emergent, and their broad backs upheave / Into the clouds" (Milton 7.285ff). 16 See "Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey" ... Selected 39. 17 This acceptance and affirmation of the natural world, even with its terrors and deadliness, is a pervasive theme in Wilbur's poems. Wilbur's psychology seems dominated by a need to affirm the benignity of creation, to 262</page><page sequence="15">RICHARD WILBUR echo God's own word in Genesis that the world is indeed "good." See "Children of Darkness" (Collected 80-81) for an explicit example of such an echo. 18 Speaking of this point of the poem to Richard Jackson, Wilbur said, "The poem [in the first section] was counseling a hopeless mode of facing the blank of sleep, and what had to be recommended was an openness rather than a safe selectivity" (144). 19 "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters" (Psalms 23.2). "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb" (Isaiah 11.5-9) and "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together" (65.25). 20 The various elements in Wilbur's Vishnu image-sage, Vishnu dream- ing, his maya, the pool-are probably not from a single source. The image is almost definitely a composite, each element freely adapted to Wilbur's purposes. Wilbur uses a similar image in two other later poems-"All That Is" and "In Limbo"- and the source for the former is almost certainly The Mahabharata 3(37)186 (pp. 589ff). For other possible sources of these images see the episode of Pandu and the pool in The Sri Mad Devi Bhuagavatam 572-92; "Maya" in Walker 53-54; Goudriaan 30-31, 44-446; O'Neil 37-39. For pertinent explanations of maya see Goudriaan 18-21 and O'Neil 30-39. 21 As I see it, "The Mind Reader" is also a critique of the poet whose position is that of a pseudo-prophet, one who inhabits another Poe-esque visionary blank of the mind "Where the soul mopes in private" and who cannot quite settle the question of whether there is "some huge attention . . . Which suffers us and is inviolate, / To which all hearts are open, which remarks / The sparrow's weighty fall, and overhears / In the worst rancor a deflected sweetness" (Collected 106-10). 22The imaginative position Wilbur adopts is in this sense more characteristic of the modernism of Frost than that of Stevens. Frank Lentricchia has put the distinction between Wilbur's modernist precursors well: "Frost's creative perceptions never transmute experience beyond recognition: the experienced universe is cherished even as the mind works its magic, quietly reshaping things to fit his needs. Stevens's fictions are impelled by a more radical commitment to the idealistic position; the world of his poems is often cleanly severed from the world of ordinary perception" (153). Poirier makes the contrast in this way: "Stevens and Frost part company at the point where Stevens exercises his belief, with Santayana, that the power of the imagination can create realities in a poem that can exist in defiance of the evoked realities of a 'fact.' Truth was not required, as it was for Frost and the William James of Pragmatism, to 'grow up inside of' finite experiences; rather, it was something that imagination could create as an alternative form of experience" (147-48).
