<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XI. No. 4. FEBRUARY 12, 1914 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS SOCIETIES TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THE twenty-second annual meeting of the American Psycho- logical Association occurred at Yale University, December 29 to 31. From first to last the attendance was large and representative of the northeastern part of the country. The chief social feature was the joint banquet held at the Hotel Taft in connection with the American Philosophical Association. Numerous smaller impromptu luncheons, occurring at other times, contributed to the pleasure and value of the meeting. At the business meeting the several standing committees and officers presented reports and appropriations were made to cover com- mittee expenses. Professor Whipple resigned from the committee on teaching experiments and Professor Kirkpatrick was elected to the vacancy. The next annual meeting is to be held at Philadelphia in affiliation with the American Association for the Advancement of Science. For that meeting the following officers were elected: Presi- dent, Mr. R. S. Woodworth; New Members of the Council, Mr. G. N. Whipple and Mr. S. I. Franz. Mr. R. M. Ogden was elected secre- tary-treasurer for a period of three years, and a stipend of two hun- dred and fifty dollars per annum was fixed for the position on recommendation of the council. Mr. E. B. Twitmyer was elected representative of the association on the council of the American Association and the nominating committee for the coming year con- sists of Messrs. H. W. Warren, E. L. Thorndike, and J. R. Angell. On motion of Mr. Urban a committee of three is to be appointed by the president to consider the advisability and means of offering prizes for distinguished work in psychology. There was considerable feeling manifested that the association meetings can be made more helpful than they are. This feeling found expression in a recommendation of the council that next year the executive committee arrange for more informal dinners, smokers, 85</page><page sequence="2">86 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY luncheons, etc. Such meetings, it was thought, would favor informal conferences among persons of kindred interests. One round-table conference on mental tests of college students found a place on this programme. Mr. Woodworth presided, and there was discussion by Messrs. Whipple, Cornell, Bingham, Wells, Major, Porter, Haggerty, and others. If arrangements for such round-tables can be made so that persons interested in similar prob- lems can be brought together for informal discussion, the value of the annual meetings will be greatly enhanced. Our sessions are too often made up of condensed lectures and too little discussion. This result is almost unavoidable with our programmes arranged as they now are. Where the materials for the programmes are offered by individuals, there is sure to be a heterogeneous list of subjects. The secretary must then do heroic work to arrange these into sessions with some degree of unity. The interest of recent meetings is due largely to the success of the retiring secretary in accomplishing this feat. This method of securing a programme, valuable as it is from certain points of view, has serious limitations and the newly elected officers may well study methods for improving the general plan. The apparatus exhibits begun at the Washington meeting con- tinue to be a source of great interest. The Stoelting exhibit was again on display and there were individual pieces shown by Messrs. Whip- ple, Dunlap, Dearborn, McComas, Kirkpatrick, Bentley, Franz, Porter, Hays, Warren, Bingham, and others. The programme of forty-four papers had but three lacunoe due to absence. At one time double sessions were necessary. In spirit the meeting had a decidedly behavioristic tendency. More than half the papers either championed the behavioristic point of view in one or another form or reported experiments pursued through behavioristic methods. A considerable part of the time the word itself was in the air. Mr. Warren, in the president's address on "The Mental and The Physical," championed a monodualistic view of mind and matter. lie contended that science is not yet ready to adopt a metaphysics of mind and matter. But some working hypothesis of the psychoneural relation is needed in order to fix the scientific status of psychology. The double-aspect view (monodualism) seems to fit the conditions best. This conception of the relationship between mental and phys- ical becomes clear when we examine the analogous relation between surface and mass in our perception of material phenomena. If mental and physical activity are two inseparable aspects of one series of events, then the scientific assumption of uniformity or "law" is extended from the physical into the mental sphere. The old anthropomorphic conception of choice and reason must be radi-</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 87 cally amended. In the light of modern science the presumption is that mental phenomena, including choice and reason, are as uniform as physical events. The burden of proof rests on those who deny the regularity and determinacy of human volition and human reason- ing. Even teleology may be brought into line with the mechanistie processes of nature. Foresight is the conscious counterpart of pur- posive activity, which is due to distant stimuli preparing the response to contact stimuli by means of a complex nervous mechanism; the beginnings of this purposive activity are manifest far down the organic scale. Psychology should embrace both the inner and outer aspects of experience. It is the science of the relations between the individual and his environment. These relations may be studied either objec- tively as behavior, or introspectively as events of consciousness. Be- havior study is essential to an understanding of genetic problems, it serves also as a check on the data of introspection. Introspective psychology has disclosed uniformities among mental events; it claims recognition by science on the ground that science should include every branch which contributes to a unified view of the world. The behaviorist himself admits that consciousness is a necessary instru- ment of research. Without it there would be no scientific observa- tion or generalization. Sense perception and the logical processes require analysis quite as much as the facts and values which they reveal. Science must study its instruments as well as its data. In opening the joint session with the philosophers, Mr. Creighton contended for a psychology which is not existential, but teleological, The physical sciences, based on the mechanical theory, do not de- scribe concrete individual things, but seek to determnine the general conditions and relations of material existence. Psychology has attempted to obtain information of the same type as that expressed in the laws of physical nature. Its laws, therefore, refer to the conditions of mentality in general, in abstraction from the individual- ized form of concrete minds. The question arises whether these abstract conditions of mentality have not ultimately to be expressed in physiological rather than in psychological terms. Is it possible to maintain that there are existing processes or modes of conscious- ness or even that there is any genuine scientific advantage in describ- ing mental life from this point of view? Even if we grant, as it is probably necessary to do, that a psychological physiology or a physio- logical psychology is necessary, yet this type of science does not satisfy all the legitimate demands that are made upon psychology. There is also necessary a science of psychology, which shall deal with the concrete individualized form of experience and which shall ex- press its results in terms of a different mode of uniformity from</page><page sequence="4">88 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that of the natural sciences. Its method is teleological rather than casual, and its standpoint is that of the concrete self in its relations and functions. This type of psychology is no mere unrealized ideal, but is found both in the historical systems and in contemporary investigations. Its method of analysis is different from that of the existential psychology, but not inferior in either definiteness or certainty. Mr. Urban contended that psychology has the same need as any other science of the support of philosophy, because philosophy de- velops its methods and problems independently and takes its material from the whole field of experience. Certain problems lead more directly to philosophic speculation, and it is in clearing up these ideas that philosophy may be of assistance to psychology. The notions of introspection, probability, and of the psychometric func- tions are used as examples. In trying to correlate mental states, as revealed by introspection, with definite groups of conditions one encounters the difficulty that no group of conditions, no matter how carefully controlled, will always produce the same mental content. As a matter of fact, judgments given on the comparison of two stimuli have all the features of chance events, and the question arises whether we have to conclude from this that they are not causally necessitated. The notion of the psychometric functions offers a problem of similar great generality. In empirical determinations of these functions one has to restrict oneself to certain simple expres- sions called analytic functions. This restriction contains certain implications which may be broadly stated in this way. Events char- acterized by such functions may be fully determined on the basis of a finite number of observations, and, once determined, the course of these functions may be followed up indefinitely into the future or back into the past. The assumption that the events of nature may be represented by analytic functions must be made every time mathematical reasoning is applied to the study of nature, because the general type of function can not be used successfully. Can this restriction be justified? It seems that it is at the bottom of certain peculiarities of our notions about causality. The way to advance this problem consists in analyzing the logical implications of this assump- tion and findina the consequences of dropping it as a whole or in part. The behaviorist note was present in Mr. Dewey's discussion of the standpoint of psychology. The speaker dealt with the topic "as it presents itself in the actual teaching of philosophy." Whatever may be the abstract theoretical aspects of the methodology of the two sub- jects, from the standpoint of the present teaching of philosophy, the subject of philosophy is intimately tied up with the conceptions</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 89 involved in the current teaching of psychology. It was pointed out that almost all the epistemological problems that are in the fore- front of discussion to-day are what they are because of the fact that psychology is thought to afford scientific warrant for belief in a separate psychic or mental realm of existence, having its own self- contained entities, laws, and systemizations, and for the belief that these psychic existences are either the primary immediate data of knowledge or else the terms and units out of which knowledge is com- posed. Hence such problems as whether we can know an external, material world, and if so, how; whether there is any reason for believ- ing in such a world; whether the psychic event or "consciousness" modifies the real object in the act of knowing it; how mind and body are connected in acts of knowing and willing; whether a psychic existence can have physical efficiency; whether it falls under the law of causality applicable to physical existence, etc. The genuine- ness of such problems and the significance of the philosophy that deals with them is absolutely dependent upon the standing of the primary conception brought over from psychology. It was pointed out that if the "behavior" movement made much headway in psy- chology, students (and future teachers) of philosophy would approach philosophy with such different preconceptions as radically to alter the subject-matter and method of philosophical discussion. In con- clusion, the question was raised how far the fundamental assumption of current introspective psychology had itself grown up within psy- chology on the basis of its own scientific data and how far it was a heritage from the philosophy of Locke and Descartes. If it should turn out to be the latter, the circle of relationship between current psychology and current philosophy would be complete; so that how- ever distant from the ideas of the seventeenth century philosophers prided themselves upon being, they would still be inquiring into their topics from the standpoint set by those ideas. In animal psychology, which seems to be the field out of which the term behaviorism takes its rise, there were four papers. Mr. Craig reported on the attitudes of appetition and of aversion in doves. He defined an attitude of appetition as a condition in the bird which keeps the bird restlessly active, trying now this and now that, until at last he gets from the environment that particular stimulus which sets off a final reaction (end-reaction) after which the bird appears satisfied and restful. In some cases the appetitive attitude is an incipient end-reaction; in other cases it is different from the end-reaction. The stimulus sought, which is needed to activate the end-reaction, may be the stimulus of an entire situation, involving even memory factors. Many instincts of birds are of an opposite type, namely, attitudes of aversion, which keep the bird</page><page sequence="6">90 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY restlessly active so long as a certain stimulus is present, but give him peace after he has succeeded in ridding himself of that stimulus. It has been said erroneously that in animals there is no true dis- tinction between work and play, that the animal's activities are all play. A dove may be observed to make repeated trials to overcome difficulties, enduring bodily injury, and continuing the struggle for a long period, urged on all the while by an appetitive (or aversive) attitude tending toward a certain end-situation. This is work. Doves exhibit also conflict of attitudes, hesitation, and a final over- coming of one attitude by the other. In certain cases the attitude which stimulates the agent himself serves to stimulate also other doves (patients) toward the same or correlative ends. Regarded simply as observable motor phenomena (disregarding questions of intelligence, and of conscious states) these activities of birds seem to be the same, only more simple, as the behavior activated by desire, purpose, volition, in men. Mr. J. F. Shepard contrasted the labyrinth learning of ants, rats, and cats with the learning of man. The former learn back- wards while normal people learn more rapidly from the beginning of the maze. There must, therefore, be "some difference in orga- nization which gives the ant, the rat, the cat, and the person different types of control of behavior. It is suggested that the theory which gives association a character of inhibition as positive as excitation may be a possible explanation of this organization." Mr. Cole reported an investigation on color-blindness of cats. Two cats confused a yellow with a white paper of the same flicker equivalent. Two others confused Bradley standard blue with a dark gray cambric and with a blue cambric, with which in turn they con- fused the same gray. Two other cats confused red with black, and two others confused Bradley green with Bradley "cool dark gray." Thus a gray was found which was confused by two cats ?wth each of the colors yellow, blue, red, and g;'een. All confusions persisted for more than six hundred trials. Hering grays were found to be useless for the experiments. The two cats which had learned to select yellow as a food-color confused it with each of twelve colors of nearly the same flicker equivalent. In the same way blue was confused with three others colors, green with seven, and red with nine other colors. As we worked through the spectral colors in order an area of "difficult discrimination" was found partially surrounding each "confusion area." Two persons with dichromatic vision were asked to sort these color-papers as Holmgren worsteds are sorted. Each of the dichromates made five confusions which had been made by the cats. Both of the dichromates and the cats agreed in the mnatches</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 91 (confusions) of two pairs of colors, and for each of these pairs the flicker equivalents were identical. The colors confused with yellow and green had almost the same flicker equivalents as yellow and green, respectively, while those confused with red and blue varied widely in flicker-value. This would suggest a shortened neutral spectrum, yet while red was confused with black, blue was confused with a very dark gray, but not with black. The work was done under natural, daylight conditions, and the fact that so many con- fusions were found suggests that, under the precautions taken, the visual sense alone could be employed by the animals. In the light of Ives's recent results,1 which show that the flicker method is supe- rior in both "sensibility and reproducibility" to the method of equality of brightness, flicker values can hardly be ignored in experi- ments on vision. Mr. Cannon reported further on the physiological effects of fear and rage. In addition to restoring a fatigued muscle wholly or almost wholly to its original irritability, injected adrenalin markedly increases the speed of coagulation of the blood. The adrenalin liberated in pain and the major emotions hastens greatly the clotting of blood. This reaction would be serviceable in case of injury to blood-vessels in conditions which rage and pain might involve. One session on experimental psychology was devoted chiefly to papers on vision. Mrs. Ladd-Franklin proposed to reform color ter- minology. It is wrong to permit the term color to be used with its present ambiguity,-as both including and excluding the series of grays. The term is needed in the inclusive sense, and there is a simple means at hand by which we may make it unambiguous,-for color proper, we should say chroma. We have already all its derivatives in common use, dichromatic, achromatic, tetrachromatic (for normal four-chroma vision). For the grays, including black and white, she proposed to make use of the term achroma. With these two names for the specific and the non-specific light-sensations, we have at once two good words for the degree in which each sensation-constituent is pres- ent in, say, a grayish blue: we can speak of its chromaticity and of its achromaticity. There are four unitary colors proper, or chromas, and four series of color (chroma) blends. The words orange and purple should never be admitted into scientific speech,-non-unitary colors should not be given unitary names. Just as there exist no unitary names for the yellow-greens and the blue-greens, so we should, in the other two series of color-blends, speak always of the red-blues and the red- yellows. The term brightness has been thoroughly vitiated for scientific I Phil. Mag., 1912.</page><page sequence="8">92 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY use by the absurd color theory of Hering-his followers mean by it three things at once: (1) brightness in the real sense; (2) an as- sumed whiteness-constituent (though the color may be, for sensa- tion, prefectly saturated) ; and (3) an imagined dissimilation-process which is taken to be its physiological correlate. Since it is impos- sible to rescue this word, at present, for its correct meaning, it is indispensable to discard it entirely. Its place should be taken by luminosity, or subjective intensity. Hering has said lately that those who can accept neither the psychological nor the physiological conceptions which lie at the base of his theory, may nevertheless be grateful for his terminology. But in fact his terminology, as regards "brightness" at least, is almost worse than his theory. His theory is, moreover, so bound up with his baseless terminology that the simple restitution of the term brightness, for instance, to its natural and unambiguous significance (subjective intensity or lumi- nosity) would suffice, I have no doubt, completely to upset his theory. It is the surreptitious introduction of Hering's hypothesis as to the physiological substratum of brightness under this triply ambiguous term that permits one to be oblivious of the untenableness of the theory. A corrected color-terminology, therefore, far from being inimaterial, is bound to have important logical consequences. Miss Cook reported an investigation of the relation between the quality of colors which pair off as complementaries, and those which mutually induce each other in simultaneous contrast. The method was that of making color equations by means of rotating disks of colored papers. Both complementary and contrast colors were formed by the usual procedure. The results agree with those of Tschermak 2 in showing that the contrast color is both redder and bluer than the complementary. The discrepancy is slight for red and for green, large for yellow and for blue. The anomaly is explained by Tschermak as being due to reddish- blue adaptation of the eye in ordinary daylight. If this were the case, the direction of the anomaly could be changed by artificial color- adaptation to different colors. Experiments under conditions of artificial color-adaptation, however, show no variation in the direc- tion of the anomaly and only negligible variations in its amount, whether the eye be adapted to red, blue, yellow, green, gray, or to ordinary daylight. Evidently, therefore, Tschermak's explanation is inadequate, but the experimenters have no better one to offer. Mr. Langfeld reported on a case of color hearing. The phe- nomenon of color hearing of a talented musician was examined twice, a period of seven years intervening between the two investigations. It was found that the colors agreed even to the 2 Pfliiger's Archiv, 1907.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 93 subtler nuances. In the later investigation the colors accompanying certain chords and the difference between consonance and dissonance as regards the resulting colors were noted. Mr. Ferree and Miss Rand have investigated the method of Flicker for the photometry of lights of different colors and find it deficient. The paper (1) briefly compared the relative advantages and disadvantages of the method of flicker and the method of direct comparison with regard to sensitivity; (2) showed that the method of flicker does not possess of itself the sureness of principle needed to justify its use in accurate work; and (3) showed that as yet its results have not been found to agree in the average with those of any method which can be shown to have this sureness of principle. It was pointed out that at the rate of speed at which the impressions are given in the method of flicker, the eye is very much underex- posed to its stimulus. This underexposure has the same effect on sensation as a reduction in the intensity of the lights used, and the amount of this reduction is so great that with the intensities used in practical work the Purkinje phenomenon is involved in every judgment or comparison that is made. The third point was covered in the following way: (1) It was pointed out that the only method that has thus far been used as a standard with which to compare the method of flicker has been the equality of brightness method. (2) It was shown that the extension of the equality of brightness method to the photometry of colored light so far as that extension has been made to the present time, has been based on a false assump- tion with regard to the effect of colored and colorless light on sensa- tion, and that the method, therefore, does not possess the sureness of principle needed for a standard method. And (3) it was shown both from experimental work and from a preponderance of the work done by others who have made the comparison, that the results by the method of flicker do not agree in the average with those ob- tained by the equality of brightness method, and, therefore, that justification for the adoption of the method of flicker can not be found, even could that method be taken as standard. The after-effect of visual motion was discussed by Mr. Hunter. The visual motion was produced by black and white strips rotating about a horizontal axis. The motion was viewed through a screen with an aperture 4 X 71?2 inches. Six subjects were used. The author obtained results which require an interpretation upon the basis of eye-muscle strain due to inhibited tendency to follow moving lines. The following facts may be given in support of the above: (1) The after-movement is, in general, in the same direction as this strain. (2) The appearance of the after-movement may be inhibited by vigorous straining of the eye muscles in the fixation during the</page><page sequence="10">94 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY real movement. (3) Eye movements, confined to central area of drum, plus winking and general muscle strain, will prevent the appearance of the after-movement, though a negative after-image of the aperture is obtained. (4) If a mirror be placed below the rotating drum so that the motion is seen going in opposite directions, eye-muscle strain may prevent the appearance of all after-move- ment, or it may control the after-movement either on the drum or in the mirror. Often the after-movement which opposes the direction of strain is controlled, while that goina in the same direction is affected. (5) If one eye is stimulated by the movement, an after- movement may be seen with the other eye either on the stationary drum or upon a printed page. No negative after-image of the aper- ture appears in the unstimulated eye. This after-movement is not sharply localized and can be accounted for on the basis of the har- monious action of the muscles of the two eyes. (6) The stationary drum may be made to appear to rotate either up or down by strain- ing any eye muscles in the corresponding directions. It is not con- tended that the muscle strains alone are the effective conditions of all after-movements. Both the fading of after-images and associa- tion factors are influential as shown by data accumulated. Wohlge- muth has opposed the after-image theory on the ground that constant stimulation soon results in uniform fatigue. If this were true, no movement could be seen, as is evident from rapid rates of rotation. Miss Fernald presented a study of color preferences among thirty- eight school children between the ages of six and eight. In a pre- liminary series of comparisons of the four colors of the Milton Bradley series (red, blue, green, and yellow) certain results appeared which seemed to require further confirmation, with control of cer- tain factors, before they could be accepted as generally valid. The most striking of these results were a marked preponderance of preference for blue when standard colors were compared and a shift to red (pink) when tints were under consideration. It appeared from this that hue was not the only factor to be considered, since in the case of red and blue, at least, the preference changed from one to the other with a shift in brightness of colors compared. An attempt was made in this preliminary series to discover the effect of back- ground by the use of white, gray, and black cards, but these did not appreciably alter the situation. In a more careful attempt these points have appeared. (1) Under the conditions of the work the method of paired comparisons seemed applicable in the tests of a majority of children, though there were a few failures to make consistent selections. (2) The question of the particular red or blue or other color used seems important when any given series of colors, such as the Milton Bradley, is used. For</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 95 purposes of esthetic comparison with other colors, in the case of young children, the standard orange red seems the better qualified to represent the red group, and it is being so used in other tests at present. (3) In the red and the blue series, each containing three tints, three standards, and three shades, confirmation was obtained of the common statement that children like the more saturated colors, since the standards received the largest number of choices. Second- arily there was a selection of tints in preference to shades. Two papers on hearing were presented. One by Mr. Rogers dealt with the binaural phase difference in sound localization. Pre- vious investigators have argued that with sounds of low pitch com- ing from considerable distances the difference in intensity at the two ears would be too small to be used in localization of these sounds by binaural intensity ratios. They have shown, furthermore, that un-der certain experimental conditions the localization of low sounds is clearly controlled by phase relations, each sound being localized on the same side as the ear which receives its series of impacts ahead of the other. Recent critics have explained the phenomena as due to interz ference of sound waves meeting within the head, and have con- cluded that the phase difference operated in these experiments only through producing intensity difference. Other critics have ques- tioned the experimental data. Mr. Rogers reported that the experiments have been repeated in modified form, largely through the work of Mr. Carl R. Brown, with corroboration of the previous positive results. It has also been shown that under the conditions of these experiments the proportion of sound conduction through the head is so slight as to make it im- probable that it could produce such results as appear, that a serious error is present in the mathematics of the arg4ment by which the operation of the phase difference is explained in terms of intensity differences, and that, rightly calculated, the sound interferences, if they were effective, would produce just the opposite results from those that actually occur. He concluded that binaural phase differences do produce direct and specific effects in the nervous system, and that these are a genuine factor in the localization of sounds of low pitches, not only under the artificial conditions of these experiments, but under natural con- ditions as well. In an investigation of pitch memory Mtr. Baird found that abso- lute pitch memory is subject to wide individual variation; when the eighty-eight tones of the piano were presented in irregular order, nine observers made the following percentages of correct identifica- tions (264 or more judgments by each observer): 99, 97, 89, 73, 62,</page><page sequence="12">96 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY 51, 41, 32, and 26. Tones from the middle region,-the once-accented and the twice-accented octaves,-are most accurately identified, and tones from the subcontra octave were least accurately identified. Relatively few errors were made with the piano tones; then follow, in order of increasing difficulty, pipe organ (diapason, reed, string, flute qualities) flute, clarinet, forks, voice (tenor, contralto, soprano, bass). A determination of the limits of pitch within which each tone of the octave (naturals only) is still identifiable shows an overlap- ping in every instance,-for instance, a tone of 545 vibrations is sometimes identified as c, sometimes as d. (These determinations, however, were made by means of the Tonvariator; and all of the observers reported that tones of this clang-tint were exceedingly difficult to identify). All observers agree in identifying the note more accurately than the octave to which it belongs,-a circumstance which seems to support the view (Revesz, Kohler) that tones posses.s an attribute of character in addition to their attributes of pitch and clang-tint. The testimony of all nine observers agreed in asserting that absolute pitch memory is not a product of deliberate training and practise. Two studies on human learning were reported, one by Mr. Kirkpatrick on "Memorizing versus Incidental Learning." The particular thing learned was a portion of an advanced multiplica- tion table. Normal students and sixth-grade children were subjects. The methods were (1) memorizing, then using; (2) using at once, guided by a key sheet of products; (3) computing the products. The memorizing or practise was continued eight and ten idays. The final test of efficiency was writing as many answers without a key as possible in two minut.es. The groups that practised computing averaged the greatest number of answers. Those that spent all the time in practise next, and those that spent part of the time in memo- rizing wrote the fewest. Those that spent eight out of nine days in memorizing were much behind those who spent only four or five days out of ten in memorizing. The results in this preliminary ex- periment suggest that the traditional practise of learning and drill- ing on facts such as the multiplication table, then using them after- wards is wasteful as well as wearisome. In a contribution to the question of "quick learning," "quick forgetting," Mr. Woodworth stated that the contradictory results obtained, according as retention is measured by the saving in re- learning or by the amount recalled, make it desirable to introduce further variations into the study of the above question. One varia- tion consists in avoiding the matter of individual differences, and examining the learning and retention of single associations by the same individual. In one of the experiments reported, an Italian-</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 97 English vocabulary of 20 pairs of words was to be learned from audi- tory presentation. After one reading, the experimenter gave the Italian words as stimuli, allowing 3-5 seconds for each response, prompting and correcting, and so continuing till each correct re- sponse had been given once. Over-learning was avoided by dropping each pair from the list as soon as it was learned; but after all the responses had been correctly given, the experimenter read the whole list through once more. After an interval of 2-20 hours, the experi- menter again used the Italian words as stimuli, and got the score of correct responses, and also a report of associative aids employed in remembering any of the pairs. Under these conditions, the more quickly learned pairs were the better retained. Thus: Of the pairs learned in 1 reading, 73 per cent. were recalled after the interval. Of the pairs learned in 2 readings, 72 per cent. were recalled after the interval. Of the pairs learned in 3 readings, 63 per cent. were recalled after the interval. Of the pairs learned in 4 readings, 58 per cent. were recalled after the interval. Of the pairs learned in 5 readings, 38 per cent. were recalled after the interval. Of the pairs learned in 6-11 readings, 27 per cent. were recalled after the interval. Since the aided pairs (pairs in which the subject saw some rela- tion between the terms or developed some mnemonic to hold them together) were both mnore quickly learned and better retained than the unaided pairs; the advantage of quick learning probably lies partly in this association with aids. But this is not the whole story, for when the unaided pairs are considered by themselves, the quickly learned among them are better retained than the slowly learned; and, indeed, the quickness or slowness of learning makes more difference to retention where no aids are present than where they are present. We conclude that quick learning favors retention, and aided learn- ing favors retention, each independently; but that the two influences work together, inasmuch as the best aids suggest themselves promptly and promote quick learning. The order of merit method appeared in an investigation of com- posite group judgments by Mr. Scott. Students were told "to rank in order of importance the motives which determine the election of studies by your 1,000 fellow students (10 motives specified)." "Rank in order of importance the qualities that give prestige to the 1,000 college students (provided with a list of 8 such qualities)." "Who is most respected in your home community-the successful business man, lawyer, minister, physician, or professor? Rank the five in the order in which they are regarded in your community." "The attempt to answer these questions," said Mr. Scott, "is not only a good exercise for the student in social psychology, but the answers are illuminating to the professor in charge."</page><page sequence="14">98 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY In the use of the same method Mr. Hollingworth presented some characteristics of judgments of evaluation. He pointed out that the method has been used chiefly as an instrument in the investigation of some specific problem, such as family resemblance, interests of chil- dren, value of advertisements, measurements of school progress, dis- tribution of eminence, etc. Little attention has been paid to the characteristics and behavior of the judgments themselves. When the various studies are considered together a number of interesting prob- lems arise concerning the judgments themselves. He pointed out some of these problems, and reviewed the available material, suggest- ing tentative conclusions and further problems. Mr. Rosanoff made a preliminary report of a higher scale of mental measurements. The special problem is to develop a simple method whereby a subject's mental capacity might be estimated from what he has acquired in the course of his education in comparison with the average acquisition of a large group of subjects of the same degree of education. The method proposed consists in the employment of a free asso- ciation test applied by means of a list of one hundred stimulus words gathered from the field of systematic education. The plan is to collect a large number of test records from subjects of various degrees of education and thus to develop a series of standards. The special object is to employ the test, when normal standards are available, in the study of native mental capacity in cases of insanity. A small amount of material already collected seems to indicate (1) that the number of "appropriate" reactions is in correlation with degree of education, and (2) that, the factor of education being constant, there is great range of variation which is tentatively as- sumed to be in correlation with native mental capacity or at least with educability. Mr. Cornell reported data on the influence of race, color, nativity, and truancy on the answers to the Binet tests. The evidence fur- nished by the statistics quoted is mostly negative. The statistics were taken from examination of delinquent boys at the Philadelphia House of Detention, boys between 'nine and sixteen years of age and mentally of inferior grade. Under these circumstances it is not pos- sible to demonstrate the effect of home and neighborhood environ- ment as it affects very young children in many cases. Nor was it possible to show the effect of truancy in a group of boys whose total mental equipment is usually the third or fourth grade at the age of 14 years. However, certain evidence in the case of younger children, not so detailed as the evidence in the principal group studied, is here presented. The charts here displayed show the percentage of successful</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 99 answers to the questions designed by Binet for children of 9 years, 10 years, 11 years, and 15 years (Goddard's revision). Altogether, 24 test questions were reviewed, 5 questions being contained in the group for each year except year 15, in which there are only 4 questions. Of the total of 24 questions the answers by the white native group and the white foreign group were practically alike, and therefore practically similar to the percentage for the total of all children of that age. In only five cases was there any difference, and in these the difference was not marked. These five were the reasoning out of simple problems (IX., 4), answered slightly better by the white native children; placing three given words in a sentence (IX., 5), answered slightly better by the white native children; arranging weights in proper sequence (X., 5), answered better by the white native children; association test giving opposites, answered slightly better by the white native children; repeating six numbers, done better by colored children; and making change, answered better after ten years of age by the white native children, but at ten years of age by the white foreign children. A corresponding attempt to demonstrate differences in the answers to the Binet tests in truant children compared with children of known good or fair school attendance proved similarly barren of startling results. In the 24 questions the answers of which were studied, 19 were answered equally well by the truants and by the boys who had been in fair or good school attendance. In three test questions, namely, interpreting pictures, and ability to write a mes- sage by the cipher code, and giving opposites in the association test, the truants did slightly better on the average than the others. In the problem stories requiring correct conclusions the truants did slightly worse. Turning from these negative results to a study of younger chil- dren, the writer brought forward a study made on a number of small children attending the school of observation and practise connected with the Philadelphia Normal School. These children were all of a very good social station. The answers to the Binet tests averaged two years above the Binet standards for age. The two studies bring out the general truth that differences in the Binet answers due to environment will principally be found in younger children. Mr. Woods has undertaken a historiometric study of eminent scientists designed primarily to furnish an objectively derived work- ing list of the leading names in the history of the natural and exact sciences. Three leading encyclopedias have been utilized as a stand- ard for inclusion-the Encyclopedia Britannica, La Grande Ency- clopedie, and Meyer's Konversation Lexikon. Out of these the 1,300</page><page sequence="16">100 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY most prominent scientists have been selected from each encyclopaedia, so that three lists contain the names of those to whom the greatest amount of printed space is alloted. About 300 names appear in all three lists, and are called class A. Class B consists of about 450 who appear in two of the three lists. Class C, those who appear in but one of the three lists (about 2,100). The rise and fall of scientific activity can then be measured. The most significant changes are the rise in Germany during the nineteenth century and the decline in France. These changes are probably due to environment and not to heredity, but the cause of the change is not quite evident. There is apparently little bias of the editors of the encyclopaedia towards their own countrymen as regards scientists of the highest eminence or men long dead. This bias is much stronger towards living men and less eminent men. In historiometric work some triangulation or other method of objective proof is necessary. Conformation from various points of view and convergence of results will lead towards increas- ing certainty and a progressive inductive science. Mr. Fernberger presented a study intended to determine, experi- mentally, the effect of the elimination of the two extreme intensities of the comparison stimuli. Two series of lifted weights were employed; one, an extended series of seven pairs of stimuli; the other, a reduced series of five pairs. These were mingled in such a way that the results from both were taken simultaneously. The space errors were elimi- nated and the time errors were kept constant. Six thousand judg- ments were taken from each of three subjects. The averages, for all three subjects, of the values of the interval of uncertainty for the extended and the reduced series, show a difference of only 0.07 gram. The point of the subjective equality shifts somewhat, being 0.34 gram lighter for the reduced series than for the extended series. Hence it would seem that the elimination of the two extreme values of the comparison stimuli makes practically no variation in the deter- mination of the sensitivity of the subject. Such an elimination, obviously, reduces the time and labor necessary for the acquiring of the data upon which the calculations are based by nearly one third. A second psycho-physical paper by Mr. Mitchell dealt with the influence of distractions on the formation of judgments in lifted weight experiments. The investigation involves the problem of at- tention and attempts to answer questions, similar to those raised by Miinsterberg, Titchener, Wirth, and others, by the use of a technique and methodology much more refined than these workers had at their disposal. The judgments in experiments with lifted weights, ob- tained and treated by the method of constant stimuli as developed by Urban, are the basis of this discussion. Two kinds of distractions were used: (1) While the subject gave all attention to the judgment</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 101 of the weight, a distracting sound stimulus was presented. (2) At the same time that the subject lifted the weight he had to count dis- crete sounds, that is, a second operation was carried on. During the investigations approximately 75,000 judgments were made and on the basis of these the following conclusions were given. First, contrary to the traditional view, distractions (a) increase the precision of judgment, that is, the subject's judgments are more consistent, and (b) cause an overestimation of the weight, or in other words, with a decrease of attention there is an increase in sensation intensity. Second, with distraction the sensitivity of the subjects is in- creased, the upper and lower difference thresholds being nearer together. Third, the current division of attention into voluntary and in- voluntary may not be valid, the method used here suggesting a more satisfactory way of evaluating such psychical processes. The vagaries of Freudianism were criticized in two papers. Mr. Dunlap contended that under the caption of "The Pragmatic Advantage of Freudo-analysis" successful psychoanalysis by Freudian methods does not necessitate the discovery of the actual association at the base of the patient's trouble, but merely the build- ing up of a new association which supplants the old and the final breaking up of the substituted association. The conventionalized sexual symbolism is an admirable device for the formation of strong associations, but a long period of time is necessary. In a paper on "The Freudian Idea of Ambivalence," President Hall said that neither paidologists nor pediatricians have ever ascribed such importance to childhood as do the Freudians. Every dream, neurosis, or psychosis, if only analyzed, reveals infantile de- terminants. Every form of Janet's "flight from reality," autism, normal day dreams, every lapse from apperceptive to associative thouaht, from the abstract to anschaulich, is a retreat towards the state of infancy. Art, poetry, myth, religion, are largely realizations of childish wishes. Thus the first three or four years of life are fateful for health, virtue, and success. The Freudians can not apply psychoanalysis directly to infants. In fact, only two have been studied with any detail. But they construct their child from the lives of great men and from pathological cases. Ferenezi and some others find in prenatal life the basis of a solipsistic "Allmacht der Gedanken" seen all the way from magic to ultra idealism later. We sympathize with Sterni's protest, endorsed in the Breslau meeting of physicians, against turning the analyst loose on children. Now, Freud says, "Das Unbewusste ist das Infantile," or that part of it which is repressed. It is where complexes are performed, and these</page><page sequence="18">102 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY are mainly unconscious, and psychoanalysis is only a method of get- ting at them. Yet we are now told that the future of psychoanalysis rests more with psychologists of the normal than with psychiatrists. The writer protested against Jung's large use of "libido" to include even appetite for food, insisting that the autos preceded the eros, pointed out that the Freudian child was only a fragment of a child, that the traits studied were abnormal, and that the tendency to apply them to normal children was the great error of the Freudians, that a child in whom they were much developed was per se abnormal. In a paper on "Intoxication and Ecstatic Trance in Religion'" Mr. Leuba attempted to establish three theses: 1. In all, or nearly all, non-civilized peoples states of intoxication are looked upon as religious states par excellence; they are described as God-possession. 2. In the religions of civilized nations, and in particular in Chris- tianity, similar states, i. e., ecstatic trances, are likewise looked upon as union with the divine. 3. The reason commonly offered for the identification of intoxica- tion and trance states with divine possession, namely, the apparently superhuman character of these states (vision, anesthesias, etc.), and the alleged superhuman powers and knowledge which come to man when in this condition, do not account adequately for the amazing attractiveness of intoxication. This is apparent in the fact that in- toxication retains its hold upon man when it ceases to be regarded as divine. In an analysis of intoxication consciousness, the author uncovers the more fundamental reasons for the place secured by intoxication in religion. Three methods of producing religious intoxication are described, the chemical (various drugs: peyot, soma alcohol), the mechanical (rhythmic dancing), and the psychical (as in the Yoga practise and in Christian mysticism). A supplementary report on the effect of a prolonged fast was given by Mr. Langfeld. At the time of making a series of psycho-physiological tests upon a man fasting 31 days, a report of which was given at the last meet- ing of the association, it was not possible to conduct experiments after the subject had begun to take food. A year later, however, the opportunity was given to make similar tests covering a period of six days on the subject under normal conditions. The tests used were the hand dynamometer test, the tapping test, the space threshold test, the cancellation test, memory tests, and association and reproduction tests. In all of these the records were as good if not better than at the end of the fast, and it must be remembered that at that time</page><page sequence="19">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 103 -many of the tests showed improvement. As might be expected, the strength tests showed the greatest improvement, being even better than at the beginning of the fast. It seems, therefore, from these results that the fast did not have any ill effects and certain facts may indicate beneficial results. A distinction between images and ideas was set forth by Mr. Dunlap. Images are not contents modally resembling the special sensation of vision, audition, etc., but are muscular sensations. They may, therefore, be observed directly only by introspection, although other means of observing the total complex (muscle contraction), of which the image is a part, are important for the investigation of the conditions of thought. "Introspection" as here used signifies noth- ing more than the observation of images (muscle sensations) and feelings. Perceptual consciousness is conditioned by the are reflex from non-muscular receptor to muscle; consciousness of pure feeling by the reflex from receptor to gland. The reflex from striped muscle to striped muscle conditions directly the consciousness of muscular action, and derivatively the thought of the object given originally by the perceptual reflex whose terminus ad quem is the terminum a quo of the thought-reflex. The idea is, therefore, the derivative con- tent of the thought consciousness, and does not include the immedi- ate content, or image. The image, as it is conventionally described, masquerades in plumage stolen from the idea. Mr. Jared S. Moore discussed the articulation of the concepts of normal and abnormal psychology. He pointed out the striking dif- ference in terminology and point of view between the literatures of normal and abnormal psychology as we find them to-day. Especially, the doctrine of the complex, which is so important for abnormal psy- chology, is disregarded by writers on normal mental processes. This is unfortunate land unreasonable, and detrimental to the student of psychology. A complete understanding of mental disorders involves an understanding of the complex as a normal factor in mental life. The psychological problem is threefold-structural, genetic, and dynamic. Structurally, the complex is composed of cognitive and affective elements-the cognitive elements being grouped into ideas, and these into systems of ideas. So, again structurally, personality is an integration of systems of complexes-the individual complexes being grouped into systems, these into systems of a higher order, etc. The genetic problem is itself twofold-the problem of the develop- ment of complexes out of their elements, and the problem of the development of the personality by the accretion of new complexes. The dynamic problem is concerned with the conative aspect and motor tendencies of the complex, and leads to the distinction between normal and abnormal psychology-normal psychology treating of</page><page sequence="20">104 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the harmonious activity of complexes, abnormal psychology treating of conflict, repression, and dissociation. Mr. Coe discussed the psychology of having friends. Friends' mutual enjoyment of each other offers for analysis a social experi- ence that is easily accessible to the psychologist, and that is rather promoted than hindered by reflection upon it. The naYve under- standing of this experience asserts: (1) That which each friend en- joys is the other friend, not merely goods to be mediated by him, and (2) that the reason why a giver is valued above his gift is that a giver has experience. Apparently, then, we value objects not only as experience, but also as experiencing. What has psychology done with data like these? In general, it has investigated social intercourse from the standpoint of the mechan- ism of the process, and from the standpoint of knowledge, but in only a minor degree from the functional standpoint. Particularly, the kind of value realized when a friend simply "has" his friend, and the kind of adjustment therein achieved, have received scant attention. (A) Something has been done with specific phases of social intercourse, as suggestion and imitation. (B) Genetic study has shown that the process of attaining self-consciousness is at the same time the process of defining our social objects. (C) Eight kinds of answers have been given to the question, "How do I know that any other mind exists?" They range from "I see and hear my friend"; through "I infer by analogy," "I postulate," "I intuit," all the way to "There is continuity of substance between minds," and even "Individuals overlap." None of these theories gives a sufficient account of the kind of value involved in "having" a friend, or of the relation of this value to the "having." (D) Psychology has determined that other-regard is not merely refined self-regard. This is one step toward a psychology of social values. (E) Psy- chology has raised the question, What is the "psychological" point of view with respect to such multiple experiencing as friendship asserts itself to be? No decisive answer has been given. If I as psychologist consider myself and my friend merely as content of experience-in-general, conversation being treated as internal dis- course, and conversely as merely slower parts of the conversational flow, I am unable to construe "having a friend" in any sense that I can recognize as true description when I enjoy the experience itself. It does not appear that psychology can either deny or translate into anything else the naYve assertion that I enjoy a second experiencing. Mr. Faris, choosing the case of a Congo tribe which does not punish certain of its members, attempted to show the relation between punitive justice and the social consciousness. There are three possible reactions of a group toward an offender</page><page sequence="21">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 105 against social customs. There may be an immediate and instinctive attack with no thought of limit or measure. There may be a social reaction in which the culprit is considered a member of the group with interests that are identical with the interests of the rest. Or, thirdly, an intermediate attitude is possible where some consider the culprit as a friend and others as an enemy, in which case the friends will see that the enemy does not go too far. The first of these attitudes is war, the second is a social attitude, and the third alone can be properly designated as punishment. It is owing to the absence of foreign members of the community that some tribes do not punish. To the homogeneous tribe, there are only two classes of people: kin who can not become enemies, and enemies who can not become kin. If one of the enemy attack, there is an immediate and instinctive retaliation with the destruction of the foe for its object. The attack is made even when self-interest dictates otherwise. But this can not be called punishment. Punish- ment does arise among the slave-holding tribes where the group is complex. It is possible to break some of the bonds of union, leaving others intact. An historical survey of psychological methods was given by Mr. Ruckmich. Four different interpretations are found in the usage of the word " metliod " in a study of more than a score of systematic works in psychology: (1) general mode of investigation of phenomena, e. g., "experimental method," "introspective method"; (2) a specific type of procedure for purposes of control or treatment of data, e. g., "method of impression," "statistical method"; (3) point of view taken or intention assumed in an investigation, e. g., "genetic method," "descriptive method." These three are methodeutic, but the last is logical in nature: (4) the type of reasoning involved in the pursuit of any of these three or in the systematization of the results obtained, e. g., "inductive method," "synthetic method." The use of the first three classes of method is traced through the history of psychology from Aristotle to the beginning of the nine- teenth century by interpretation of the works of representative psy- choloaists, and from that time to the present by a classification of the expositions of method as given in the systematic treatises of the leading authorities. The most important feature of the development of method is its derivation, on the one side, from casual observation and occasional experiment, and, on the other, from the functions of the "inner sense." A constant shift of emphasis on one or the other of these factors is marked. The final movement toward experi- mental procedure took place soon after Kant's refusal to admit psy- chology to the rank of a science. From that time on, with the refine- ment of experimentation, the use of "method" was broadened to</page><page sequence="22">106 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY include the second meaning in addition to the first and third. The modes of investigation, however, also received critical treatment and became more sharply defined. The establishment of psychology on an empirical basis as a science took two directions: (1) the widening of the scope of psychology to include comparative and physiological aspects, and (2) the application of quantitative methods. At present, the main differences between the various systems which grew out of this development of the science lie in the several senses in which the principal methods are used, and in the several evaluations of the methods. Uncontrolled introspection, for example, is considered by one group -of authorities as a method which may contribute facts to the science, by another, as wholly useless to the science. Again, some authors maintain that experiment can control conditions affecting both introspection and general observation of organic movements, while others declare that its realm is psychophysics, physiology, or the simpler mental processes and complexes. It is essential that sys- tematic writers come to terns on the evaluation and interpretation of the various methods, and also on the usage of the word "method." Miss Washburn, in discussing the Aufgabe and intellectual in- efficiency, pointed out the relation of the Aufgabe and bodily attitude of activity. This activity attitude tends spontaneously to relax sooner or later. Its duration is in part determined by physiological con- ditions, but is influenced also by a psychological factor. The relax- ation of the activity attitude is hastened by too much attention given to the sensory accompaniment of the attitude to the attitude of work- ing rather than to the work itself. Three types of intellectual in- efficiency may be explained on this hypothesis as to the nature of an Aufgabe: the lazy person, the spasmodic worker, and the fickle worker. The lazy person seldom assumes the activity attitude. The spasmodic worker quickly releases it, although he may recur to the same task repeatedly after intervals of relaxation. His activity atti- tude relaxes too soon, partly, at least, because he gives too much attention to the attitude itself and thus lowers the threshold of fatigue. The fickle worker is characterized by long-continued single periods of activity, but when he has once dropped a task he tends not to recur to it. His activity attitude has been so long continued that the unpleasantness of extreme fatigue associates itself with the ideas of the Aufgabe, so that subsequent recurrences of the activity atti- tude fail to recall effectively this particular task. It becomes more and more evident that to equate psychology with the study of consciousness is unsatisfactory. Mr. Frost attempted by definition to eliminate consciousness altogether. He attempted an explanation of what is usually ascribed to consciousness, on a strictly physiological basis. How can we explain the fact that things not</page><page sequence="23">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 107 only are, but that they get reported? If we consider "awareness" as a physiological and not a psychological term, a start will have been made. "Awareness" shall then characterize the response of neural mechanism to stimulus. Iris reflex is a simple illustration. Such a sensori-motor arc may be called an "alpha-arc." An alpha-are shall then characterize any simple, single, sensori-motor path initiated by a peripheral stimulus, and resultant in some end-effect. When alpha-arcs involve higher cortical centers, a further neural beta-arc may be aroused in the association centers. Beta-arcs are then like alpha-arcs, save that they take for their objects just prior alpha- arcs, and the end-effect is modified by complication in terms of pre- vious neural experience. Such beta-arcs the writer terms " consciousizing processes. " Their biological significance is to allow of the modification of ordi- nary reflex behavior in terms of the past experience of the organism. No arcs, alpha or beta, are self-sensing, but any arcs (beta, gamma, etc.) may become aware of any previous are (alpha, beta, etc.). Such awareness is what is commonly termed "consciousness." Alpha-acres, not arousing beta-arcs, are called " pre-consciousizing processes" (reflexes) ; while arcs that once aroused such beta-proc. esses, but no longer do so, are called "consciousized processes" (habits). Behavior would appear to be completely and most simply explained by the mutual functioning of groups of alpha- and beta- arcs, without the confusion of the hypothetical "consciousness." " Sensations," then, are not "first things in the way of conscious- ness, " but the second. There must always be at least two physiologi- cal processes, successive in time, for one to be a consciousizing proc- ess, or "sensation." The iris can never get a sensation. An alpha- arc might give "red-awareness "; the subsequent beta-arc, if aroused, would then give "sensation-of-red. " Can either introspection or logic demand any further characterization of "sensation-red experi- ence" than to say that a nervous impulse has passed through the cortex, and there aroused a second impulse which takes it as its object? Physiological processes are not the vehicle of the psychic, but are themselves just what and all we can mean by consciousness. Neither introspection nor logic can demand any further "elementary psychic process," or "knowing function." Mr. Dearborn made suggestions as to the possible neurility of euphoria and the sthenic index. I. The basal feeling-tones (euphoria and dysphoria), so far as physiological, are more or less determined by the environment of the receptors, euphoria representing relatively perfect adaptation.</page><page sequence="24">108 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY II. Three chief factors seem contributory to the euphoric cenes- thesia: (A) nutritional and sympathetic influences from the intesti- nal villi; (B) kinesthesia proper; and (C) the epicritic (dermal) impulses. III. The four million villi of the intestine, rich in muscle and sympathetic nerves, probably adapt the blood's content of the nutri- tive "lipoids" and protein to the immediate needs of the nerve-cells, and besides may send inward sympathetic influences which in the brain become euphoric. IV. The tonus and the active contraction of the voluntary mus- culature make variable, but essential contributions to the dynamic reservoir of the central nervous system. Moreover (Bergson) kines- thesia undoubtedly adds much of euphoric trend to the cenesthesia by providing in part both intensity and extensity to the other senses. V. The integrated epicritic impulses appear to predominate in human physiologic euphoria, and there seem to be two chief modes of stimulation, evaporation and oxidation. VI. Air that is dead, i. e., not moving, humid and too warm, humid and too cold, or lacking in oxygen, iS a chief occasion of physiologic dysphoria. Physiologically, these conditions probably are lacks,-lack of movement over the skin, lack of dryness (evaporation so being lessened), lack of the physiologic temperature, and lack of dermal oxygen-reflex determinants of respiration. VII. Adopting for the nervous system the all-or-none principle, the actual neurology ("viatility," Morat) of the euphoric and sthenic balance becomes an interpretation of the "synaptic" relations in the action-system. VIII. Physiologic euphoria is, then, more or less determined by ample, unimpeded, and undeflected neurokinesis. This unimpeded flood of ample neurokinesis is a condition of a high stheni. index capable of factuating (or inhibiting) vigorously a rapid succession of motor paths. Under the title "Notes on The Mechanism of Continence," Mr. G. V. N. Dearborn presented the following: The problems most pressing for practical solution are psychologi. cal. As analysis of contrectation (Moll) at once shows, the genesial impulse involves potentially the entire epicritic receptive field, and this cenesthesia provides the neurobinetic tonus of part of the volun- tary behavior, involving the whole brain. By association among the thousands of millions of neurones, this desire is normally in humans sublimated into love. In the subconscious, as well as out of it, this tonus of impulsive cenesthesia flooding the psychomotor cerebral neurones with energy is often a powerful initiative force in the con- structive behavior of young adults,-its leading motor idea, involving</page><page sequence="25">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 109 the whole organism more or less. Repression by way of secrecy and false shame keeps active that which should usually be quiescent and latent; and makes that which should be, by knowledge-base habit, subconsciously under control, often strongly aggressive, incontinent. The neurology of voluntary movement involves factors more or less like the following: 1. The Nervous Circuits; Kinesthesia.-(A) Between muscles and gray cord. (B) Between cord and brain. 2. The Cerebral Influences of Spatiality.-(A) Ocular and other visual muscles. (B) Retinae. (C) Semicircular canals. (D) Active muscles of limbs, etc. (E) Local signs. 3. The Gray Fabric of the Hemispheres.-(A) Ideas of useful- ness. (B) Memory-images of movements, etc. (C) Awareness of ability. (D) Interests and emotional tones. (E) Inhibition. Skill apparently may be considered a generalized or localized voluntary control based on the current fusion (at first conscious) of the two opposed, but complemental phases of kinesthesia, one actuat- ing, vegetative, and generally unconscious, the other inhibitory, per- sonal, and conscious,-both subject to habituation, originating at adolescence, by stimulating the development of the voluntary muscu- lature, provide with the sexual impulse the means of its control. Continence, then, appears as an inhibitory generalized skill, grace, and cleverness based in adequate conscious correlation of the lower centers with the higher, and in extensive and intensive voluntary and habitual control not only of the skeletal muscle, but of the vegetative effectors to some extent. Continuence is not wholly an ethical and an esthetic matter, but one inherently and most intimately related to (and even an index of) the most practical phases of life-capability, efficiency, competency, self-knowledge, initiative, personality, man- hood, and womanhood. Scientifically, then, incontinence appears as an index of a lack of personal culture, as clumsiness, inefficiency, stu- pidity, and failure. The genesial impulse developing in the adoles- cent is normally safeguarded by the simultaneous development of a consciousness of general voluntary bodily control and of the surpass- ing efficiency of his organism both actuative and inhibitory. This ex- perience of "finding oneself" constitutes a criterion of physiologic age which, partly because functional rather than structural, is more significant than others so far suggested. Appropriate tests for its determination would make it as definite a criterion, too, as any now in use. M. E. HAGGERTY. UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA.</page></plain_text>
