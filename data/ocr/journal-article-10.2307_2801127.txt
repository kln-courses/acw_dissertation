<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WEST, THE BIBLE AND THE ANCIENT EAST: APPERCEPTIONS AND CATEGORISATIONS J. J. FINKELSTEINt Yale University I It is a commonplace of modern anthropology that descriptions of exotic societies and analyses of their institutions cannot be properly undertaken if, at the outset, the observer does not have an adequate comprehension of the world view, or of the categorical framework of the society under investigation, since it is just this frame- work which gives definition to the single institutions constituting the whole, while each of these, in turn, functions in such a manner as to reinforce the total structure. It is this interaction between framework-specifically the intellectual and the categorical-and the constituent institutional elements that reinforces the total structure and helps to maintain the integrity of the society-at-large. Of equal, if not of greater, importance, the investigator must be constantly alert to his own inherited categorical system through which the data being observed must inevitably be filtered and assimilated, a process which is indeed necessary if the data are to be comprehended by the investigator himself, and especially if they are to be made comprehensible to the audience to whom he would communicate his findings. By and large, the scientific study of societies, whether ancient or contemporary, exotic or Western, is a pre-occupation that developed within the intellectual life of a particular civilisation, namely our own, the one we conventionally denominate as 'Western'. It is hardly necessary to observe that the bounds by which this civilisa- tion is defined are far less territorial or even cultural than they are spiritual and intellectual. That is to say, they define a commonly held cosmology, a way of automatic and immediate apprehension of experience. As the stream of experience is received, it is segmented, that is, it is distributed and categorised on a pre- existing grid largely in an unconscious manner. This cosmology, this distinctively 'Western' mode of cognition, is generally acknowledged to be the product of a fusion of what were originally two separate and distinct cosmologies and cultural traditions, namely those of the Biblical and Hellenic civilisations. While in most respects the elements of these two traditions can no longer be isolated out of the amalgam of Western cosmology, it is nevertheless usually acknowledged that the more dominant effect on the value component-the moral quotient-in our classificational structure has been exerted by the biblical source. It is by virtue of this understandcing that the designation of our civilisation as 'Christian' or 'Judaeo- Christian' has come to be accepted as synonymous with the term 'Western'. With the conditioning provided by this cosmology it therefore becomes inevitable that the observer sees and studies the phenomena of alien societies and cultures with what may be succinctly characterised as 'Western eyes '.I We cannot enter here upon a detailed rehearsal of the long history of interaction between biblical scholarship and the study of the- Ancient Near East-more Man (N.S.) 9, 59i-608.</page><page sequence="2">592 J. J. FINKELSTEIN particularly of the civilisation of Ancient Mesopotamia-to which the above observations are especially pertinent. We must ignore here altogether the in- ordinately large mass of works from either of the two 'opposing camps' of a blatantly tendentious cast. For the truth remains that even the most disinterested or impartial investigations in this area have been adversely affected by a limitation of perspective common alike not just to biblical scholars and assyriologists, but to their audiences as well; all of them are, ultimately, Westerners addressing other Westerners. The more specific, and probably the most fundamental, handicap against our unobstructed vision in confronting the cosmological information of ancient Mesopotamia, is that there is inherent in our own apperceptions a dichotomised view of the experiential universe: we perceive the phenomenon of 'Man' on one side, and all the rest of the phenomenological universe, or 'Nature', on the other. In the biblical stage of this conception, i.e., in the primeval form of this cosmic apprehension, the division is of course threefold: God, Man, and Nature, in precisely this descending hierarchical order. But it soon becomes apparent that the reality of the first constituent of this triad is not of the same order as that of the remaining two. The distinction is made manifest in the very first chapter of the book of Genesis, vvs. 26 sqq. where the description of man as having been created in God's 'image' and 'likeness' begs the question, inasmuch as the incorporeality of this god is the fundamental tenet of biblical and, ultimately, of all Western belief.z As has been often observed, however, the issue is easily resolved if the sense of the passage is reversed-as indeed it must be-and the unitary deity of the Bible explained as the 'creation' of man in his own image. This statement in the first chapter of Genesis must therefore be seen as the expression of an awareness of the unique position of man in the universal scheme of things as it was apprehended by man himself. It is the biblical author's way of abstracting, isolating, and apotheo- sising precisely those characteristics of man which he senses as the most significant; those which set him apart from the rest of the visible universe.3 The essence thus abstracted must of necessity stand outside this natural order, yet dominate it through the agency of man. Within the more strictly construed experiential universe, therefore, the effective categories remain only two: man, and the rest of natural creation.4 This is brought home with particular force in the sequence of God's acts of creation as narrated in Genesis Ch. i: the terrestrial and celestial phenomena, including all other living beings, are created and set in place by the deity so as to constitute a fully furnished environment for man who, as befits a regal figure whose domiciliary amenities must be seen to in advance, appears last. It is noteworthy in this perspective that even the sun, moon, and the stars are stated to have as their purpose 'to serve as markers for specific times,5 for days, and for years; they shall serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to illuminate the earth' (Vvs I4 sq.). Creation, finally, is consummated with man and by God's injunction to him to conquer and keep in subjection all the rest of the visible universe (vvs. 28 sqq. and esp. IX: I-7).6 The universe of the Bible is thus to be seen as unreservedly man-centred. Man is its focus and apex. God, to be sure, stands above man in this hierarchy, but he is the overlord who is not physically a part of this universe despite the belief that his force-and, on occasion, an even more palpable presence-is manifest within it. The</page><page sequence="3">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 593 visible universe is for man alone to conquer and dominate-to rule over, wisely and justly, as God's steward-but to rule and dominate all the same.7 Turning here to consider briefly the elements in Mesopotamian cosmology that might correspond to the biblical scheme as just outlined, the initial difficulty confronting the investigator is that there exists no single 'canonical' or systematic Mesopotamian exposition of its cosmic point of view. That we should look for, and expect to find, some such adumbrated statement in cuneiform literature testifies to nothing more than the cosmic orientation of the observer, i.e. of our- selves. But that the Mesopotamians provide no such statement is actually a logical concomitant of their own pluralistic and multi-dimensional response to such themes. In order to extract anything resembling a coherent cosmological 'system' out of such varied and often 'contradictory' sources deriving from various locali- ties within the 'cuneiform world'8 and spanning a period of more than two thousand years, the investigator must create his own synthesis. It is as inevitable for us to seek to fashion such a synthesis as it must of necessity do violence to the Mesopotamian testimony when we have finally created one. Apart from this dilemma, we face the difficulty that explicit statements bearing on Mesopotamian cosmology are, more often than not, allusive or laconic since they are not directed towards the issue that is engaging our attention, but are subordinate to some other expositive purpose, or are interpolated within some magical or ritual text having a particular and immediate cultic function. I shall attempt here no more than a series of generalisations about Mesopotamian cosmology in its largest dimensions which may be useful to my immediate purpose. II If one could distil the essence of polytheism out of the varied and colourful mythological sources which have come down to us, it might be defined as a perception of the universe as being sustained and ruled by a large-and in principle probably infinite-number of independent forces. Some of these are apprehended as wielding authority over great domains of the visible universe and as affecting the fortunes of all people everywhere, while others exert only limited 'supervision' within narrow bounds (not necessarily territorially) and are meaningful only to specific areas or groups of people. All, however, are conceived basically in anthropomorphic guise. The truly major deities are very few in number, however, and it is not surprising that the domains which they govern or with which they are identified comprise the three primary regions of the visible or tangible universe, the celestial, the atmospheric, and the chthonic. Mesopotam- ian theological speculation in different centres of learning and in various ages was preoccupied with systematisation of the pantheon, with the grouping and re- grouping of deities into families, courtly organisations, and even in large manor- type organisations in accordance with the political structure and ideological emphases of any particular time and place.9 The single most significant constant, however, through this entire theological history is that at no time did such speculation arrive at the notion of the absolute omnipotence of any single deity or-to regard the matter from the opposite end-that authority exercised by any of the major gods was nothing more than 'delegated' power that was ultimately</page><page sequence="4">594 J. J. FINKELSTEIN the sole possession of a single divine overlord. The supremacy of Enlil-deriving from the theology of Nippur, which achieved dominance in Sumer early in the third millennium B.c.-did not entail the absorption of, or even any real encroach- ment upon, the jurisdictional province of other major gods. Enlil's supremacy- as that of Marduk of Babylon and Ashur of Assyria, which were- little more than adaptations of this theology for other times and places-lay rather in his relation-. ship to humanity than to the other gods. For Enlil personified the vital forces inherent in that part of cosmic geography-from the surface of the earth up to the vault of the skies-which most immediately affected the well-being of mankind (and of all living things), namely the life-sustaining ones of fertility, vegetation, and all the phenomena associated with the maintenance of an abundant food-supply. But Enlil's overlordship as regards the other gods, as distinct from his perceived relationship to humanity, was more honorific than substantive. He was the over- lord of such gods as An, Inanna, Utu, and Nanna ;I0 but he neither delegated to them their respective jurisdictions, nor could he usurp them. Even more to the point, the Nippurian theology could not eradicate-nor is there evidence of any deliberate effort in this direction-the older and 'rivalling' theology of Eridu, wherein Enki was the supreme deity. Enki (Ea in the later Semitic literature) remained throughout totally independent of Enlil. He was the fountainhead of all the arts of civilisation and of wisdom in general, the archetypal Promethean god, the patron of, and spokesman for, mankind. In this guise he retained the power even to thwart Enlil's decision to destroy mankind through the primeval Flood by alerting Atrahasis (later identified by the additional name of Utanapishtim, the Mesopotamian prototype of Noah) of the impending catastrophe and giving him explicit and detailed instructions for securing the means to escape the fate awaiting the rest of his fellow men. The Mesopotamian gods were, in short, independent and limited in authority or power at one and the same time. When, in the context of some particular cosmogony, a single god is elevated to supremacy and proceeds to parcel out the cosmic domains to the rest of the pantheon-as Marduk does in Enuma Elish, the so-called 'Babylonian Epic of Creation'-the scheme is best understood as a reflection chiefly of local, time-bound, political realities that have been transposed onto a cosmic plane. They do not offer us an authentic insight into the more pro- found constants of Mesopotamian cosmology, i.e., its apperceptions of the nature of 'deity', and the immutable interrelationships between the great gods. For the fundamental fact to be grasped is that the essence, the individuality, of any given deity could not be thought of in isolation from the province which constituted that deity's domain be it part of the natural universe or of some cultural institution created by man. Just as these provinces are autonomous though interrelated, so were the gods who personified them autonomous. The god's very being was in effect coterminous with the phenomena he 'controlled'. This quality, of course, is what distinguishes above all between the 'immanence' that characterises Meso- potamian deity, and the 'transcendence' which characterises the god of the Bible. But although the major Mesopotamian gods are independent in their respective spheres, they nevertheless act in concert if not always in complete harmony. The interdependence, or interrelationship, among the gods just alluded to has been aptly characterised as an 'integration of wills' (Jacobsen I949: I39 sqq.), this</page><page sequence="5">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 595 integration being resolved in the conception which apprehended 'the cosmos as a state'. Just as the terrestrial environment and human society itself had been organ- ised into a polity that (ideally, at least) assured stability against the threat of anarchy, so too were the gods, the otherwise autonomous powers of the universe, organised into a divine polity which held at bay the dark powers of chaos. Indeed Cosmos denotes the very structure that came into being at the beginning of mythological time when the domination of primeval Chaos was brought to an end." But using the structure of human society as the model, the conception of a polity of the gods entailed a corollary analogy between the individual person and the individual deity: the gods are subject to all the human frailties and limitations. The sole human disability from which the gods were exempt was that of mortality.Iz The Mesopotamian deity was, in effect, little more than a 'super-human' being in almost the precise literal sense of that term. The anthropomorphic conception of deity in Mesopotamia served to reinforce the limitations already implied in the identification of a particular god with a specific sphere of the objective universe. The autonomy of the god within his or her sphere meant that, viewed as a polity the gods, whether individually or collectively, could never exert absolute universal sovereignty. The Western mind, with its biblical orientation, has tended to regard this Mesopotamian conception of deity as restricted, if not 'flawed'. But apart from the fact that we have to do here with an immediate mode of cosmic appre- hension and not a conscious choice among alternatives-and hence a category of thought where the imposition of normative values is at best meaningless-the Mesopotamian conception of deity was not without its advantages. The gods, to be sure, were 'all too human'. Being restricted, or unable fully to realise themselves as individual personalities, they could not give their undivided attention to the concerns of mankind; the cosmic equilibrium required that they first and foremost 'keep an eye' one upon the other. The sympathetic attention of the gods might be implored by man as circumstances prompted, but such entreaties could never guarantee unfailing response. But by virtue of the absence of the power of real omniscience, and due to their frequent engagement in affairs other than those which concerned mankind, the gods could be cajoled or even outwitted. Above all, the course of a person's fortunes might be advanced by resort to magic. Magic rests on the belief that there is a latent potency in things, as well as in words and sounds, singly or in combination, beyond the more obvious effect such entities exert in their normal intrasocial use. This power is neutral (seen from the human pers- pective) as regards good or evil. Any adept, human as well as divine, may have recourse to it in his own interests. It can be invoked by personified forces of Chaos as well as by the gods of Cosmos. Thus, in the opening episodes of Enuma Elish, the opposing forces of Chaos led by Tiamat and those of Cosmos led by Marduk, utilise magical formulas in the battle that led to the formation of the ordered universe. Marduk's victory was assured by the greater potency of his magical arsenal, as opposed to that available to Tiamat. The same energy source may be tapped by man, through the engagement of professionals expertly trained in its use, to advance his own fortunes.I3 The appeal to magic is in some degree dependent on the implicit notion that the gods' attention is often focused elsewhere than upon mankind, so that the latter must fall back upon the impersonal but more reliable power of magic for the support of his interests. A person may thereby achieve a</page><page sequence="6">596 J. J. FINKELSTEIN measure of control over his fortunes in a manner wherein the gods-in principle at least-assumed a passive role at best, or one even of total unconcern. Mankind can at best hope to engage the gods' attention only at times; he must for the most part shift for himselfI4 It is a different matter entirely when the question is that of punishment. Mis- conduct on the part of man was sure to trigger divine retribution. Indeed, it would not be too far off the mark to say that it is largely in the context of misbehaviour that mankind comes to the gods' notice.I5 This, of course, is but another way of affirming a truism that has been sensed in many societies that 'Virtue is its own reward'. It is a maxim abundantly vindicated by experience. Its corollary (usually left unspoken) is that the reward for evil will be administered in more palpable form and by a less than benevolent tribunal. The Mesopotamians' expectations from their gods hardly exceeded that which they learned to expect from their fellow men. That his gods were so human and at the same time so distinct-and the paradox here is only apparent-was hardly sensed by the Mesopotamian as a real disadvantage. Wisdom lay in maintaining a 'low profile', to thread one's way cautiously and quietly through the morass of life with an occasional helping hand from the magician or diviner, but otherwise to attract the gods' attention as little as possible.I6 III The god of the Bible, in contrast, while transcending the experiential universe, is conceived as omnipotent within it, mankind occupying the centre, if not the exclusive focus, of his attention. Unlike the Mesopotamian gods, he has no peers; there is therefore no occasion for him, so to speak, to keep one eye trained on 'what goes on behind his back'. He is thus free to give his undivided attention to the affairs of mankind, taking constant cognisance of its conduct and being ever solici- tous of its welfare, individually and collectively. The biblical god is 'wholly other' in a sense that is in sharpest contrast with the otherness of the Mesopotamian gods. Apart from his incorporeality, he is not identifiable with, nor is he immanent in, any single physical or visible force of nature. Yet, in further contrast to the Mesopotamian gods, his presence and immediate accessibility to mankind are intrinsic to the conception of him. This conception is more readily comprehended if it is perceived that the biblical god is ultimately the externalisation of the moral consciousness; the biblical god is the human moral ideal personified and apotheo- sised. The attainment of the ideal-as distinct from identification with it-is fore- closed to mankind not so much by virtue of the limitations inherent in his physi- cality as by the impediments presented by his equally immutable condition as a social creature. Indeed, the moral factor enters only in conjunction with the aware- ness that 'there is someone else about'. Moral awareness, consciousness of the individual's limitation, began with the creation of Eve. Her arrival on the scene- and it is to be remembered that her creation is prompted by God's concern and was not in response to any need sensed by Adam-provided man at once with conflict and consolation; the dilemma is, of course, the heart of the Garden of Eden episode, and was read back by theJewish sages into the very words describing Eve's creation (Genesis 2: I8).I7 The God of the bible is therefore the extrapolation of the</page><page sequence="7">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 597 individual's aspiration, depersonalised and yet personal, the more effectively to achieve recognition through the merging of the individual self in the common socialised ideal. The incorporeality of the biblical god is an essential condition to the achievement of this kind of recognition. To be at once 'wholly other' and so immediate and personal is no more of a paradox than the combination of human- like attributes and remoteness that characterises the gods of Mesopotamia. We must probe further, however, if we are to reach the underlying sources of the contrast between the biblical and the Mesopotamian apprehensions of deity. We have already touched upon the two primary elements that are constitutive in the respective configurations: consciousness and society. Both are integral to, and indeed define, the 'nature' of man to the extent that homo sapiens senses himself as in some fundamental quality 'different' from the natural order, and more partictularly from all other creatures that live and die. Nor can it be a matter of doubt that homo sapiens everywhere and in all ages has grappled with the enigma 'What is Man?', and it is of relative insignificance whether this problem is posed in explicit words, with responses provided just as directly, or whether it remains unarticulated with its resolutions taking the most apparently devious routes. It would, in this pers- pective, hardly be an overstatement to define (other than material) 'culture' as the intellectual stock of any discrete human society accumulated over time for the purpose of resolving precisely this enigma. By and large, in the process of formu- lating its distinctive response to this universal issue, the component of consciousness is rendered subservient to, and is submerged in, the societal factor. The fusions and tensions of these two drives within any cosmology are nevertheless of varied relative force. It is the total amalgam of these forces that provides each system with its unique character. The cosmology of any society may, indeed, succinctly be characterised as 'the institutionalisation of consciousness'. The biblical response to this dilemma is forthright: the social organism is per- ceived as a magnified extension of the individual. Here it is consciousness which assumes the dominant role in creating the person's image of society and of the universe that is external to himself. The universe is experienced, and in large measure described, from the perspective of the first person. The biblical god speaks, commands, expresses his moods in direct discourse and in explicit language. Revelation, ultimately, is self-revelation. The prophets, beginning with Moses, correctly perceived their function to be that of mediums. They served as the channel whereby the several individual 'I's were put in communication with the universalised 'I'. Their particular gifts, which set them apart from their contem- poraries, were those of insight and eloquence. They provided the articulation for the all but mute individual yearning for recognition and expression. At the cost of the suppression of the specific and the idiosyncratic the individual was afforded self- expression through the external generality of the society or nation, and self- recognition through God, the externalised projection of the self From the perspective of the biblical 'I' one may well describe the cosmic geography as being constituted of a series of concentric spheres joined by a force radiating outward from ego and kept in equilibrium by the reflection of the same force. The biblical god represents the outermost and broadest of these spheres, encompassing all the others, and of infinite reach beyond. The biblical god is, in sum, the image of man magnified to infinite dimension.</page><page sequence="8">598 J. T. FINKELSTEIN IV Mesopotamian cosmology, on the other hand, was an attempt to resolve the tension between consciousness and society by effecting the submersion of the self in society and by the assimilation of the phenomenon of man altogether-individually and in the aggregate-to the external and objective universe of nature. Far from seeing man as its nucleus or focus, normative Mesopotamian thought perceived the universe as an ordered entity, a cosmos, entirely apart from the presence of man. As varied as Mesopotamian speculation was about the precise methods and circumstances of man's creation there was a unanimous assessment of his position within the cosmic scheme: man's place in the scheme was of secondary importance. Indeed, and as incongruous as it might appear, terrestrial creation, centring about the great cities of Sumer and Babylonia, was conceived as an accomplished fact before the appearance of man. It was the gods themselves who, with their own manual labour-either as the chafing serfsI8 or as the fawning sycophants of their divine overlords' 9-built the cities and excavated the rivers and canals of southern Mesopotamia. It was only to relieve these oppressed gods of their intolerable burden that humankind was created: man's raison d'etre was little else than 'the care and feeding of the gods', and the performance of the more onerous tasks necessary to maintain the cosmic equilibrium. In the final formulation of the creation of man, as set down in the sixth tablet of Enuma Elish, the purpose of this crowning achievement by Marduk is stated plainly: Upon it (i.e. mankind) shall be imposed the service of the gods that they (i.e. the gods) may be set at peace; thus adroitly transforming the routine of the gods. Nowhere in Mesopotamian cosmological literature, is it ever suggested or even implied that man is destined to dominate nature, the mandate which the first chapter of Genesis emphasises and reiterates. It is not that the Mesopotamian thinkers held a truly low estimate of man's place in the cosmic scheme, or that they were oblivious of his uniqueness within the visible order of nature. They were, on the contrary, fully conscious of it, and in at least some of their speculations on this point set forth the proposition that man partook of the palpable substance of deity; indeed, in its most explicit formulation, in the Old Babylonian epic of Atrahasis, the human prototype was formed by the great god Enki out of clay which was mixed witlh the flesh and blood of a god who was expressly slaughtered for this purpose.20 This notion is echoed in the passage dealing with the creation of man in Enuma Elish written down perhaps as much as a thousand years later. In this version the accomplishment is explicitly described as extraordinary; it is the capstone of Marduk's transformation of chaos into cosmos. In the admiring words of the narrator 'That piece of handiwork was beyond comprehension.'2I It was only after the completion of this act that the assembly of gods acknowledged that their deliverance was an accomplished fact, and they were now at last 'free'. But the vital importance of man in the mundane sphere is also underscored by the fact that the creation of man is, in contrast with the first chapter of Genesis, all that the text included of terrestrial creation. For the rest, the creation episodes of Enuma Elish are concerned exclusively with cosmographic phenomena: the heavens and the abyss, celestial geography, the meteorological and atmospheric phenomena; and the creation of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which were quite under-</page><page sequence="9">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 599 standably, in Mesopotamian terms, conceived of as being fundamental to the universe as the heavens themselves.22 It is therefore clear that the Mesopotamian response to the question 'What is Man?' was troubled and ambivalent. Their apprehension of man's unique position and significance in the visible universe of nature could not be totally suppressed. It emerged not only in the context of their specific views on creation, but came to the surface as well in other literary manifestations of their thought, particularly in their religious literature. Yet the crucial characteristic of the Mesopotamian response to this dilemma is that its intellectual drive was rather towards the assimilation of man to the external universe consisting of society and nature. Where biblical consciousness assimilated the not-self to the self, Mesopotamnian consciousness was at pains to explain the self in terms of the not-self. It is character- istic that the framing of the question itself 'What is Man?' is biblical, not Meso- potamian. And it is equally characteristic that the question was not the verbal expression of a sensed difficulty, but a rhetorical introduction to a triumphant response. It bears recalling here in full: When I regard your heavens-tlhe handiwork of your fingers-the moon and the stars which you have established, What is man, that you should be mindful of him; humanity, that you should take account of it? Yet you made him lack but little of divinity,23 and crowned him with honour and glory. You gave him dominion over all your handiwork, placing everything under his feet; All the flocks and herds, as well as the beasts of the steppe, The birds of the skies, the fish of the sea (and) all that traverse the tracks of the oceans. The first two verses of this conscious epitome of the first chapter of Genesis express sentiments to which a Mesopotamian thinker could easily have subscribed; indeed, they may be found in Mesopotamian hymnic literature in virtually identical diction. But the remainder of this panegyric to man's worth was in diametric opposition to his own appraisal of man's stature in the universal scheme. Were these thoughts to have been uttered in his hearing he would have regarded them as the acme of hubris and deemed them an invitation to divine chastisement. V Post-biblical Jewish thought provides even more eloquent expression to the biblical view, by explicitly extending transcendent worth to the individual human life, an idea which is, of course, to be inferred from the first chapter of Genesis and in the Psalm just quoted. Thus we find in the tractate Sanhedrin of the Mishnah the following statement: ... a single man was created in the world, to teach that if any man caused a single soul to perish, Scripture imputes it to him as though he had caused an entire universe to perish ... Again, [but a single man was created] to proclaim the greatness of the Holy One, Blessed be He; for man stamps many coins with the one seal and they are all like one another; but the King of Kings, the Holy One Blessed be He, has stamped every man with the seal of the first man, yet not one of them is like his fellow. Therefore every one must say, 'For my sake was the Universe created' (Danby 1933: 388, my emphasis). This statement is set forth as part of the adjuration of witnesses who were about to testify against a defendant in capital cases. Its burden was to impress upon such a</page><page sequence="10">6oo J. J. FINKELSTEIN witness the extreme gravity of his undertaking, lest he expose himself to eternal blood-guilt for having helped bring about the death of a possibly innocent fellow human. It is a pithy summation of the first chapter of Genesis, and demonstrates how directly and effectively this foundation of biblical cosmology could be invoked in a judicial context-a hypothetical one, to be sure-when a life was at stake, even where it is the community as a whole that prosecutes the defendant for a presumably capital crime. It is to be doubted that a bolder or more eloquent profession of the anthropocentric world view will be found in Scripture or in post- biblical literature. It embodies by the same token-even if too guilelessly formulated for contemporary sensibilities-the most fundamental principle underlying all Western cosmology. This adjuration amply confirms, some two thousand years before it was made, the observation cited earlier in this article (Steiner I969: 9). Its burden, and the classificatory consequences that flow from it, stand at the opposite pole from the cognitive mode and categorical system which characterised Mesopotamian experience of the self and of the external world. I suggested at the outset of this article that in the study of the phenomena of alien civilisations we must ever be alert to the larger categorical framework within which these phenomena are manifested, lest we fall into the error of assessing them in terms of our own categorical system. The danger is rendered doubly acute in the case of the civilisation of ancient Mesopotamia by virtue of the fact that for almost the entire span of its existence biblical civilisation remained in palpable contact with the older civilisation to the East, a contact which, culturally and institutionally speaking, was infinitely more significant than the impact of periodic military and political encounters. As a consequence of these ongoing and essentially cultural con- tacts we are confronted in the biblical record with institutions, traditions, and nor- mative prescriptions that bear startling similarities with parallel phenomena in the Mesopotamian record. The identities often extend to identity in verbal formulation. The divergences are equally striking, the more especially as they are found in the same context with the similarities. Given these circumstances one is easily drawn into comparisons of the parallel phenomena without due attention to the underlying categorical grounds which alone will account for the divergences between the two cultural sources. Into this categorical vacuum, as it were, the classificatory system of the investigator automatically steps. But, as we have already observed above, this system is little else than that of the biblical world itself. In a word, the biblical world view and that of the typical observer are alike in being anthropocentric. From this root perception certain classificatory lines must needs arise. The Meso- potamian perception of the universe is phenomenalistic, and from this root an entirely different set of classificatory lines arises. It should be obvious that any attempt at explicating the Mesopotamian phenomena through the application of a grid appropriate to another culture will result in misapprehension of the isolated elements, whether these run parallel to comparable biblical plhenomena or whether they diverge from them. Yet all too often this is precisely the standpoint adopted-unconsciously at times-by those so intrigued by the comparable Biblical and Mesopotamian data as to attempt a closer analysis of the phenomenon. It is not my purpose here, however, to enter into such kinds of analysis. I would here rather expand somewhat upon the broader implications of our theme. For it is my conviction that the question of the contrasting biblical and Mesopotamian</page><page sequence="11">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 6oi cosmologies is by no means limited to the historical dimension. It is no mere academic exercise to ascertain whether and to what extent inadequate methodology has resulted in faulty comprehension of the institutions and the intellectual products of a civilisation that disappeared some two thousand years ago. For the world view of the ancient Mesopotamian thinkers was not a uniquely Mesopotamian pheno- menon. The phenomenalistic apprehension of the world characterised other ancient civilisations-notably that of the Greeks-and remains as the apperceptive mode of high civilisations today, principally in Asia, as well as of preliterate soc- ieties in widely scattered places. Indeed, in the perspective of history, it is the biblical perception which must be seen as aberrant. It behoves us therefore to ponder the question whether there may be a basic 'truth' underlying the Meso- potamian world view which, isolated from much of its institutionalised over- growth, may be pertinent to some of the most crucial concerns of the contemporary world. VI We may broach the issue provocatively: Given the broader and more accurate perspectives available today for apprehending the experiential universe, both macro- and microcosmically, is it the anthropocentric (i.e. egocentric) apprehen- sion of experience or the phenomenalistic one which is more nearly compatible with the realities of the universe as these are perceived today? To frame the question in this way is not to suggest that it is being posed rhetorically. It is merely to suggest that against the background of our present awareness of the real finiteness of the universe, and especially the finiteness of the biosphere, to banish the question as unthinkable or as the ultimate heresy is a luxury which humanity can no longer afford. And the issue must be faced squarely. For even if we grant the 'truth' of our most cherished idea, namely that the preservation of humanity is a tran- scendent good-however one might understand this concept today-it has by now become acutely apparent that the corollary image of man as 'the lord of creation' now serves to hasten the doom of mankind, and perhaps of all earthly life as well, rather than to assure its perpetuation. With such thoughts now in view we may once more turn to the Mesopotamian world view, which I have just characterised as 'phenomenalistic'. The operative principle here is the empiricist one. The visible world, the total palpable environ- ment of man, must be known in all its almost infinite individual details. The most characteristic form of Mesopotamian learning is the compilation of phenomena in the form of lists. Modern assyriological scholarship has characterised this kind of inquiry as 'list science'. This list science, encyclopaedic in scope, began almost at the dawn of writing in Mesopotamnia, early in the third millennium B.C. and continued without interruption for more than 2,500 years, ceasing only with the extinction of cuneiform writing late in the Hellenistic era. Through the course of this long span it acquired a kind of canonicity which was not matched in any other form of Mesopotamian literary effort. The tradition begins, naturally enough, with the observed fauna and flora of the environment, but ultimately compre- hends people (in the form of lists of professions, kinship terms, etc.), gods, gram- matical forms, sign lists, lexicons, synonym lists, legal phrases, places, and events. The principles of order and classification are not, of course, those of modern</page><page sequence="12">602 J. J. FINKELSTEIN science. Function is as distinguishing a feature of any phenomenon as its form, and any object, e.g., a sheep used for a particular purpose, is as entitled to a separate entry as a sheep of a particular variety. Similarly, in lists of professions, a man who is a carpenter is an entity 'morphologically' distinct from a man who is a copper- smith.24 What is involved, at bottom, in all of this almost compulsive endeavour is a sense of the autonomy and integrity of discrete phenomena. Although the impulse for much of this kind of activity is clearly utilitarian it is equally apparent that much is not, and that it reflects rather a disinterested pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. And the object of this knowledge is a universe of phenomena that essentially antedate man or, at least, that exist independently of man. The Meso- potamians' designation of many of these phenomena, or homologous groups of them, as 'gods'-'deities' would be a better translation-was their way of indi- cating their perception of the autonomy of these entities, a perception which, in varying degrees and in particular contexts, is expressed with a certain reverence. One frequently finds this Mesopotamian interrelation between man and things described in modern literature on the subject of the 'I vs. Thou' type, with the strong suggestion that this betokened at least some attenuated strain of animism wherein inanimate as well as living things are allegedly endowed with 'will'.25 We need not here raise the issue whether animism thus understood has any validity for any kind of 'primitive' culture. But the invocation of this notion to explain certain basic religious phenomena in ancient Mesopotamia is gross error; it be- speaks only the kind of impaired vision induced by the occidentocentric pers- pective. To have the sense of the autonomy of things does not necessarily imply that ' will' is imputed to them as well. The autonomy of things is only an acknowledge- ment that the phenomena of the experiential universe will not on every occasion bend to the desires of man. Surely, thoughtful consideration of man's experience through time would allow at least as much cogency to this form of man's recon- ciliation to his environment as to the idea that the phenomena of the universe respond to man beneficently or malevolently (from man's point of view) at the direction of a single omnipotent Universal Will guided almost exclusively by an assessment of man's conduct. It is not that we of the West, nurtured upon the second of these alternatives, are entirely oblivious of the first. We too speak of 'the quiddity of things'. This is as much as to acknowledge the integrity of species of things, implying a sense of their autonomy, i.e., that they are not invariably amenable to man's purposes, often being downright recalcitrant, and further, that this characteristic stands in no relationship whatever to man's attitudes or moral conduct. It is only that the Mesopotamians expressed this sense by the means of a metaphor, the term for 'god, deity', which in our Western tradition has been reserved for a notion the content of which is of an entirely different order.26 It should not be supposed that the perception by the Mesopotamians of the autonomy of nature entailed some innate appreciation of ecological conservation. Such attitudes, so sensitively developed among preliterate hunting and gathering societies-the American Indians being among the most notable examples-are not to be expected in a civilisation with an agricultural economy reaching back to prehistoric times. It is characteristic of sedentary peoples everywhere before very recent times to have been virtually oblivious of the finiteness and fragility of</page><page sequence="13">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 603 ecosystems.27 The denudation over the millennia of almost all the forest cover of the Syro-Palestinian coastal regions-including the extensive and fabled cedar forests of Lebanon of ancient times-proceeded relentlessly in lands occupied by peoples of widely differing cosmological outlook. It cannot be demonstrated that Palestine in Israelite times witnessed any acceleration of the process as a consequence of the anthropocentric biblical orientation. VII But we have entered into an age when the stark realities of our planetary home whose resources are finite impress themselves upon our consciousness with increasing impact. In ages past trust in a Providence that will come to man's rescue at the eleventh hour seemed credible enough largely because the rate of depletion of land resources was barely perceptible and replenishment appeared as if it were part of a purposeful design. The skies and the seas were barely affected at all and provided what was assumed to be a ceaseless bounty, a conception eloquently set out in Genesis I: 28. We now know this to have been an illusion. Vast stretches of the oceans have already turned into watery deserts whether from pollution by industrial wastes or by commercial fishing methods, implemented along 'national' lines, on a scale undreamed ofjust a few generations ago. It is now a commonplace that none but man and his works pose the ultimate threat to the survival of man. Nor is it the case that all this has come upon us unawares, as if we had no fore- warning about what the realities of the universe really are. The western world has just marked the five hundredth anniversary of Copernicus's birth. If Copernicus himself was unaware of the cosmological implications of the heliocentric theory in their human perspectives, the revolution in scientific knowledge of the universe in the half-millennium since his time provides little excuse for our refusal to face up to them today. Nor have we heeded those in the past who explicitly tried to alert us to the moral and ethical dimensions of the physical truths. That we no longer burn our Brunos or silence our Galileos has not, unfortunately, signalled a readiness to readjust our cosmological vision to the reality of our cosmic environ- ment. We cheerfully concede the truth of this reality on the level of dispassionate inquiry but cling unquestioningly to our unspoken premiss of the transcendent value of man and of his sovereignty on earth, the root concept of all our social and political arrangements. This premiss which, as observed earlier, involves the bifurcated vision of the two realms, 'man' and 'nature', and its resolution in the direction of man, is our very mechanism for seeing; it represents our eyes rather than our spectacles. We have heretofore had little ground to suspect that our vision might not be transmitting to us a wholly reliable image of the external world, especially as we have been in the habit of either excluding ourselves from that picture or of so dominating the foreground as to reduce the rest of it to a blur. The spectacular success of this Western mechanism of vision in the ideological market- place as well as in the realm of science and technology has tended further to re- inforce our confidence that our cosmology is without serious defect. No civilisation structured on some alternative cosmological base-at least in recent history-has been able to point to triumphs of the same magnitude either in scientific knowledge</page><page sequence="14">604 J. J. FINKELSTEIN or in the organisation of 'the good society'. Indeed, the main exemplars of such alternative cosmological viewpoints, the civilisations of Asia, have tended to measure their own progress by the degree to which they have been assimilated to the Western way of seeing. As already suggested earlier, there is no intention here to take issue per se with the biblical view of man as a transcendent value, an entity whose survival on earth must be assured above all else. We may in fact properly view this self-image of man as a variant manifestation of the more general instinct for self-preservation and perpetuation characteristic of the higher forms of life in general. But not all actions taken in response to this drive, whether by animals or man, are necessarily concordant with it; the records of history and biology provide sufficient evidence to the contrary. It should be clear in the perspective of recent experience that certain measures and even attitudes adopted by man seem almost calculated to assure his extinction rather than his survival. In short, the notion of the perpetuation of mankind as a transcending concern may be viewed as a valid expression of a more universal drive. It takes a special form in man by virtue of the unique configurations of human physiology, especially of man's brain structure (Monod 1972: chs. 7-9). But this apparently innate sense has been overlaid in the Western tradition, starting in its biblical antecedents, with an anthropotheological structure major components of which must now be adjudged as at odds with its ultimate function. Stated succinctly, we now realise that the conception of man as sovereign on earth, indeed, the entire notion of some absolute sovereignty as such, is incom- patible with the aim of the preservation of the human species. In paying closer attention to the intellectual legacy of a civilisation that dis- appeared more than two thousand years ago, we are therefore not merely indulging an antiquarian inclination. Nor, on the other hand, are we straining to justify such study by an appeal to 'relevance'. On any score, the intellectual achievement of the ancient Mesopotamians demands serious attention by historians of society. Whatever its shortcomings-assuming some common yardstick by which the modern ob- server might validly measure them-it provided the Mesopotamians with answers to the most fundamental and universal questions about the human enigma and permitted them to devote their energies to the more mundane struggles of living. Neither for the mighty nor the lowly did it encourage the comforting illusion of a divine providence that would surely sustain man through life's adversities and the promise of a blissful haven at the end. Yet the Mesopotamians' cosmic perception, their reconciliation to existence in a universe sensed as indifferent, at best, to the aspirations of man proved of sufficient validity to have endured without essential alteration for at least three thousand years. It behoves the Western observer to ponder whether beneath the seeming chaotic melange of Mesopotamian myth and speculation there might not lie an almost instinctive perception of the more profound verities regarding the world order valid for other times and places, particularly our own. The Judaeo-Christian, or Western, cosmological super- structure, eloquent, triumphant and consoling to humanity as it has proved to be over the centuries, now appears to many as having rested upon a foundation of questionable solidity. We might do well to consider the advantage of assimi- lating the essence of the Mesopotamian perception, neither as a substitute for our own nor, surely, as a retreat from reason born of despair, but in the name of human</page><page sequence="15">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 6o5 survival itself If we are prepared to surrender our image of man as the sovereign overlord of earth, and regard him instead as but one constituent in a polity of equals in creation, we should at least improve the chances of ensuring this planet's continued hospitality to all manner of life, including our own. NOTES This article is to appear in Hebrew translation under the title Adam VecolJm ('Man and the Universe') in Molad in I974. I The most succinct statement I have seen of the dilemma of the ethnographer is that of R. Needham (i963: vii-ix) comparing the crisis faced by the ethnographer confronted by a chaos of strange phenomena to the situation of a congenitally blind person upon acquiring full vision as a result of surgery. 2 This sense is most vividly expressed in Yahweh's classic epiphany to Elijah, I Kings I9: II-I2, and less colourfully but with the same intent in the epiphany to Moses, Exodus 33: 20 sqq. The context in both instances is the aftermath of nationwide defection to the worship of more visible or palpable deities, Ba'al in the I Kings episode and the Golden Calf in Exodus. (These may well be synonymous, and involve other contextual parallels that would take us too far afield to discuss here.) These epiphanies were therefore intended as a direct response to the issue of corporeality and visibility of the deity. The epiphany at the Burning Bush (Exodus 3: 2 sqq.), although occurring at the same locale (Mt Horeb or Sinai), differs from the other two in that it was spontaneous, and not in response to any question about the deity's form. Needless to say, the anthropomorphic descriptions of the biblical deity elsewhere in the biblical narratives do not really contradict this understanding. 3George Steiner put it tellingly recently when he defined monotheism as 'that transcendental magnification of the image of the human self' (I969: 9). This definition is set in the context of an exposition of the recognition and the experience of the individual self as opposed to other persons, with particular stress on the self-definition of God as 'I am that I am' (Exodus 3: I4). While this approach is not irrelevant to my present theme, the definition itself may serve to express a more generalised and objectified sense of that component of man not shared by other sentient creatures. 4This has long been well understood: 'The truth is that the image [of God] marks the distinction between man and the animals and qualifies him for dominion' (Skinner I9IO: 32). 5 I fail to see how anyone can doubt that the Hebrew word here, mo'adim, denotes anything else than the fixed seasonal celebrations which the Israelites were enjoined to observe, bearing in mind that Chapter I of Genesis is part of the P source (the Priestly document in the scheme of Higher Biblical Criticism) where this term always bears precisely this meaning. Nor is it proper to regard the use of the word in this context as anachronistic or even as anticipatory. From the writer's vantage point in place, time, and outlook, these 'fixed times' are as patently part of the 'natural' and universal order as are the demarcations of the 'days and years'. The great medieval commentator, Rashi, with his rarely erring instinct, understood the term here in exactly this way. It is the only correct one. 6 The texts, of course, speak here only of the Earth, since the writers could hardly have imagined that the celestial bodies and their regions would one day come within the physical reach of man. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they are viewed as having been set in place to serve the Earth, i.e. Man. Now that man has brought these celestial regions into his physical reach, the original biblical injunction to 'fill the Earth and conquer it' (Genesis i: 28) is on the threshold of maximum fulfilment. The 'conquest of space' has become as equally familiar a phrase and as equally valid a notion as the 'conquest of Earth'. Together they constitute the ' conquest of Nature' a concept which expresses the quintessence of biblical cosmology. It is a concept which, as we shall soon see, is alien to Mesopotamian thought. The biblical view is most eloquently re-asserted in a recent discussion by the rabbinate in Israel whether orthodox Jews who should find themselves on the moon would be obligated to observe the Sabbath and other holidays (considering the fact that a lunar day corresponds to two earthly weeks). In harmony with the homocentric-geocentric biblical perspective it was agreed that all earthly holidays were to be observed, and that only the new-moon observation ritual could be omitted. (Reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, January I9, I959-this was well before the first lunar landing was accomplished.) 7 We may note here, pursuing our own theme and the observations in the previous note, that the astronauts who first circled the moon read aloud the first chapter of Genesis. The inherent import of this act was made triumphantly explicit in the first words spoken by Neil</page><page sequence="16">606 J. J. FINKELSTEIN Armstrong as he made the first human step on the lunar surface, when he declared it 'a giant leap for mankind'. The obvious piety that prompted these utterances does not alter the fact that they were not nearly as much a magnificat to God as to Man. 8 This designation is often used to denote the broad territorial span encompassing Asia Minor and the Syrian coastal region in the West to the western portion of Iran in the East which, for extended periods of time, utilised the Babylonian cuneiform writing system and were in this respect influenced by the cultural traditions of the cuneiform homeland in Babylonia and Sumer in the lower half of the Tigris and Euphrates valley. 9 The various divisions and groupings of the Mesopotamian gods may often be perceived as a kind of ' code' for describing shifts in the political and military fortunes among the city-states and kingdoms that made up what we usually refer to as Sumer or Babylonia. (Periods ofpolitical unity were relatively rare, and mostly of short duration.) A more important point, and one to which we will return below, is that the notion of 'deity' in Mesopotamian thought entails no uniform set of attributes or qualities. Similarly, the pantheon is 'open-ended' as to number. Almost any phenomenon might at one time or another be apotheosised, so that the very idea of a pantheon as we understand it is somewhat misleading. Nevertheless, the elemental forces that are sensed as governing the universe are few in number. Mesopotamian theological specu- lation consists in large measure of arranging the great host of deities into the extended families and as groups of retainers of the major gods. IO An or Anu is 'deity' and majesty personified. He is immanent in the vault of the heavens, and in his concerns most remote from the affairs of man. Inanna (Ishtar), the most potent of the female deities, is the personification of nubile womanhood, i.e., of sexual attraction rather than that of birth and motherhood. Utu or Shamash is the personification of the Sun, and Nanna or Suen (later Sin) personifies the Moon. II One must observe here that the Mesopotamian thinkers could not, any more than their biblical counterparts, really envisage a universe of absolute chaos. Thus the malevolent forces comprising that pre-creation era were conceived of as a body of monstrous personalities (or the like) acting concertedly and purposively. In Enuma Elish Tiamat leads her host of demonic forces with at least a semblance of order against the benevolent gods of Cosmos, championed by Marduk. This entire scene is also a transposition onto a cosmic level of hostile encounters on mundane battlefields between states and peoples. While the battle in Enuma Elish transcends time and place, there exist in Mesopotamian literature other mythological encounters between superhuman beings that can, with greater or lesser certainty, be tied to historical human conflicts. At bottom, we are confronted here with further evidence that the human mind, regardless of the culture which has trained its mode of apperception, remains a rational instrument; it automatically rejects the idea of randomness. Catastrophe and misfortune must be the result of a conspiracy: purpose must be imputed, and it must have an identifiable locus. The locus may be ascertained by what we would describe as reasonable means, e.g. tracking down a tangible, verifiable source, or by 'irrational' methods, such as blaming them on human or imagined sorcerers or on a host of demons. All were equally 'real', however, to the Mesopotamians, and to many other peoples as well. 12 This does not preclude the possibility of specific gods being killed in certain contexts. This is particularly the case with 'evil' or malevolent deities. Thus, in Enuma Elish, Kingu, the ' commander-in-Chief' of Tiamat's demonic army is executed by Marduk and the first human is created out of his blood. This, in turn, is an echo of the creation episode in the early Atrahasis epic in which the god slain for this purpose was one of the rebellious gods (perhaps the instigator of the rebellion) who refused to go on doing the heavy manual labour for the major gods and had threatened war against them. Nor need we take account here of the special case of Dumuzi (Tammnuz) whose annual 'death and resurrection' is intimately linked with the seasons. Gods do not otherwise die; they are eternal. The Mesopotamians themselves stated this emphatically. I3 The technique necessary to make magic effective is a craft not much different from other kinds of craftsmanship except that it depends on secret knowledge of a higher order. As such, the invention of magical techniques, incantations, etc. is credited to Enki (Ea) the Meso- potamian 'culture hero', the god whom we have referred to above as the Mesopotamian Prometheus. I4 On Mesopotamian belief in intercessory gods and 'guardian angels' see A. L. Oppenheim (I964: I98 sqq.). The point to be stressed here, however, is that this role was never taken by the major gods. Indeed, the need for such divine intermediaries-plainly modelled on the common predicament of the powerless individual seeking to gain access to and to enlist the -aid of the high and the mighty-is sufficient testimony to the 'communications gap' between the major gods and mankind. Here, again, the contrast with the biblical God-man relationship stands out boldly.</page><page sequence="17">J. J. FINKELSTEIN 607 IS The most frequent mythological metaphor for this relationship is that of the noise or din of humanity disturbing the gods' sleep. I6 Here Oppenheim's characterisation of the Mesopotamian religious climate as 'tepid' is apt (I964: I76). Again, the gulf between this and the biblical climate is too obvious to require comment. There is, nevertheless, some possibility of misunderstanding. The religious unconcern of the populace relates to the formal cult only; these occasions involved the formal clergy and the king. There is ample evidence from all periods that it was thought meritorious for the individual lay citizens to present offerings to the temples on appropriate occasions, and it may be presumed that they did so in accordance with their rank and means. I7 God's words in stating the purpose of Eve's creation that she should be a 'help by his side' was interpreted by the ancient rabbis-playing on the root sense of the word for 'by his side' which denotes 'opposition -as meaning that Eve would be Adam's 'helpmeet' if he was meritorious, but his antagonist if he were not. Greater perception is shown by another rabbinic midrash which has Adam, after having eaten the forbidden fruit and being confronted by God, lament his fate in having been provided with a companion and observing that he was without sin so long as he was all alone in the world (Ginzberg I936 I: 76 sq.). I8 This is the conception in the Old Babylonian Epic of Atrahasis. The slave-gods are described as suffering forty years of heavy labour (Lambert &amp; Millard I969: 43 sqq.). I9 This is the way the motif reappears in Enuma Elish Tablet VI. Here the host of gods set about building Esagila, the main temple complex of Babylon, in a spontaneous expression of gratitude to their heroic leader Marduk, who had singlehandedly defeated the host of Tiamat. They complete their task in one year. The latest translation of Enuma Elish, incorporating portions of the epic discovered in the last decades is that of R. Labat (I970: 36 sqq.). 20 The most detailed description of man's creation is that given in Atrahasrs I i9o sqq. (Lam- bert &amp; Millard I969: 57 sqq.). Here the prototypal mother-goddess (Nintu:Mami) does the actual fashioning upon the instructions of Enki. It is replete with interpretive difficulties that cannot be elaborated upon here. They centre upon the correct reading of the name of the god slaughtered, the special attributes he possessed or the particular reason which caused this deity to be marked for this purpose, and the special qualities which, by virtue of god and man having 'been mingled together in the clay' (lines 2I2-2I3), were acquired uniquely by man and set him apart from all other living creatures. See, for the present (in addition to the comments of Lambert and Millard), W. L. Moran (I970). The notion that the slaughter of a god was necessary for the creation of man is so far not attested in Sumerian sources, and-according to a suggestion of Miss T. Frymer (in an un- published paper)-may be an idea brought to Mesopotamia from Western Semitic sources early in the second millennium B.C. The texts from all periods, however, are unanimous about the subservient status of man in the cosmic scheme, by whatever means he was created. On such sources see Heidel (i95i: 6i sqq.). 2I I.e., it was a prodigy beyond grasp by the human mind, and even by the other gods. 22 The origins of plant and animal life and other terrestrial phenomena are totally ignored by Mesopotamian cosmologists. They are, however, taken up only in the context of con- sciously aetiological stories or in similar kinds of compositions which would fall within the rubric of 'wisdom' literature. Often these are not even independent in themselves, but serve rather as proemiums to magical and ritual prescriptions designed for concrete use. In such cases, the cosmological background is wholly secondary, and is set forth for the purpose of providing explicit identification-the full pedigree, as it were-of the phenomena that constitute the focus of the text. For examples, see the introduction to an incantation related to the rededication of temples, in which the focus is upon bricks and brickmaking (i.e. the basic element in building), and 'The Worm and the Toothache' setting forth the cosmological background wherein it is purported that the specific toothache-causing worm had been primaevally authorised to establish its 'residence' in the teeth and jawbone of man. Both of these compositions are translated by Heidel (i95i: 6i sqq., 72 sqq.). 23 This is the line from Psalms 8: 6 which has become familiar in the Authorised Version as 'a little lower than the angels', a translation which violates the Hebrew in two ways. To take 'angels' first, this is an arbitrary rendering of elohimn, 'god, deity'; such a translation bespeaks only a late, pious sensibility which recoiled from the implication of comparing man with God. Secondly, the translation 'lower' connotes the idea of status within a hierarchy, whereas the Hebrew verb here is IHSR wlhich denotes 'deficiency, lack' (of some quantity or quality). The plain sense of the line, bold as it is, is that God endowed man with a measure of qualities that just barely falls short of a level that might have placed him on a footing equal to that of God himself. 24 This accounts for the need felt by Utanapishtim to bring aboard the Ark a member of every craft as well as representatives of every animal species, as described in the Flood episode</page><page sequence="18">6o8 J. J. FINKELSTEIN in Tablet XI of the Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic. This otherwise minor variant from the biblical Flood account betrays, in fact, one of the most profound differences between Meso- potamian and biblical cosmology. 25 As far as Mesopotamian 'mythopoeic' thought is concemed, this view was given wide currency by H. Frankfort (see Jacobsen I949: I2-I5). 26 The idea of a nexus between man's moral behaviour and the gods' disposition is not absent in the Mesopotamian view, as I have already observed earlier in connexion with the ordinary man's explanation of misfortune. But the reverse of this, namely, that virtue will bring reward was at most limited to the conduct of the royal establishment. In other words, the gods were thought to pay particularly close attention to the monarch's deeds, whether they were in the realm of social policy or of religious piety, and meted out blessings or punish- ment accordingly. Yet the prosperity or calamity was not limited to the royal household, but affected the entire population ruled by the king. This we must interpret as a kind of 'fallout'; the king was the narrow focus of the punishment, as the misdeeds-when they were thought to have occurred-were those of the king alone. But his subjects suffered the consequences along with him. For contrast see the colloquy between Abraham and God just before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Genesis I8: 20-33. In the biblical prophetic literature it is of course stressed that the punishment of the nation is God's response to the corruption of the ordinary citizens, not just of their rulers. 27 The intricate network of irrigation (characteristic of the alluvial southern half of the Mesopotamian plain) is certainly not to be credited to conscious notions of conservation per se. The recent publication of the nearly complete Old Babylonian version of the Atrahasis epic (mentioned earlier) has also revealed a profound concern with the problem of overpopulation- surely the earliest overt confrontation of this issue in human history. The epidemics, famines, the preliminary catastrophes that culminated in the primeval Flood itself, were seen as measures adopted by the great gods as a corrective to this problem. At the close of the epic the gods ordain that certain groups of women are to be set apart and consigned to a life of childlessness, a measure that is intended as a safeguard against recurrence of the problem which had to be resolved by such awful means. While we may justifiably read this as evidence of some sense for the virtue of ecological balance, and as providing the sharpest contrast to the 'Be fruitful and multiply' injunction of Genesis I, it still does not amount to the kind of testimony that would reflect real perception by the Mesopotamians of the problem of ecological balance and con- servation.
