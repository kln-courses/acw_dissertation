<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION: WRIGHT ON TELEOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR* LOWELL NISSEN Department of Philosophy University of Arkansas Larry Wright's analysis of teleological description of goal-directed behavior, though ingenious and insightful, errs in the following ways: it incorrectly claims that intentional human action exhibits consequence-etiology, making it impos- sible, contrary to his claim, for reference to consequence-etiology to be meta- phorically transmitted to teleological descriptions of nonhuman behavior; it does not remove the threat of reverse causation for nonhuman behavior; it assumes in the face of contrary evidence that reference to purpose drops out in meta- phorical extension; and it cannot account for unrequired behavior directed to- ward impossible goals. In several articles and especially in his Teleological Explanations: An Etiological Analysis of Goals and Functions, Larry Wright has ably and energetically defended the use of teleological language in science. He has analyzed the teleological language of both goal-directed behavior and functions and done so in a way, as he claims, that does not presuppose mind. This paper addresses only his analysis of teleological descriptions of goal-directed behavior. Wright characterizes his analysis of teleological languages as a "con- sequence-etiological" analysis. "When we say that teleological etiologies are consequence-etiologies, we are saying that the consequences of goal- directed behavior are involved in its own etiology: such behavior occurs because it has certain consequences" (p. 56). (Unless otherwise indi- cated, all references are to Wright 1976.) If the consequences of behavior determine that behavior and those con- sequences occur after the behavior, then later events appear to determine earlier events. Wright, nevertheless, emphatically rejects reverse causa- tion. "The reversal of cause and effect has long been hung like an al- batross around the neck of teleology, but it is not clear how this view could have survived even modest scrutiny" (p. 10). The traditional way to eliminate reverse causation has been to bring Received March 1982; revised August 1982. Philosophy of Science, 50 (1983) pp. 151-158.

Braithwaite expressed the situation well: It is the reference in teleological explanations to states of affairs in the future, and often in the comparatively distant future, which has been a philosophical problem even since Aristotle introduced the no- tion of 'final cause'; the controversy as to the legitimacy of expla- nations in terms of final causes rages continually among philosophers of biology and, to a less extent, among working biologists. Now there is one type of teleological explanation in which the ref- erence to the future presents no difficulty, namely, explanations of an intentional human action in terms of a goal to the attainment of which the action is a means (Braithwaite, p. 324). The difficulty with getting rid of reverse causation by bringing in in- tentions, purposes, or goals is, of course, that teleological statements are also made about subjects believed incapable of having intentions, pur- poses, or goals. Using an intricate argument, Wright claims that teleo- logical language is extended to such subjects through a three-stage pro- cess involving, first, teleological usage that includes reference to intentions and goals, second, selective metaphorical extension, and, third, dead metaphors. The first stage of this argument says: When I explain my going to the store by saying I went 'in order to get some bread,' I do not imply that the actual act of purchase caused [m]y going which preceded it. The purchase of bread was a goal of the action, not a cause. Perhaps my having of that particular goal could be viewed as a cause of the action; but that of course is some- thing that preceded the action, and hence is not guilty of the egre- gious time-reversal imputed to teleological accounts of behavior (pp. 10-11). This takes care of the problem of reverse causation at the human level along the traditional lines described by Braithwaite. Although purchasing the bread did occur after my going to the store, it was a goal of my going and not a cause of it. Having the goal to buy bread might well have been a cause, but having the goal to buy bread is not the same as buying bread. Having the goal occurred before or concurrently with going to the store, so, it could well have been a cause of the action without involving reverse causation. Nevertheless, a problem has arisen. The consequence of going to the store was buying the bread, not having the goal to buy the bread. Since the consequence, actually buying the bread, did not determine going to the store, it is incorrect to say that the consequence of going to the store 152</page><page sequence="3">TELEOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 153 determined going to the store, i.e., it is incorrect to claim that the con- sequence of the action determined the action. Therefore, it is hardly ac- curate to describe the incident as an example of consequence-etiology. One could, of course, describe it as "intended-consequence-etiology", but that is something quite different. Since no one is likely to reject Wright's conventional analysis of the teleological statement "I went to the store in order to get some bread", doubt is thereby cast on his general thesis that teleology involves consequence-etiology. The thesis of con- sequence-etiology does not appear to apply to what is usually acknowl- edged as the paradigm case of teleological explanations, the explanation of intentional human action.1 'One might, however, object that when Wright says behavior is determined by conse- quences he is not referring to ordinary causal relations, for he says, "But we must begin by recognizing that what follows the 'in order to' in teleological explanations is not even offered as a simple cause, and that whatever sins against orthodoxy such explanations commit, reversing the usual order of cause and effect is not among them" (p. 11). Sometimes by "causal" he seems to mean merely explanatory, apparently based on a connection between "cause" and "because". Of Charles Taylor he says, "There he ev- idently feels uneasy about using an unanalyzed notion of causal dependency (occurs be- cause . . .) . . ." (p. 32). Sometimes he refers to something that is explanatory of origins. "The position here would be that teleological explanations are causal in the very broad sense that they explain what produces or brings about the behavior in question; they offer an etiology" (p. 25). This passage also speaks of the broad sense of "causal", to be contrasted with the "merely causal". "A merely causal explanation of B would provide an etiology in terms of the antecedents of B, not its consequences" (p. 57). The broadly causal is the kind relevant to teleology. The passage above explaining "causal" as explanatory of origins also links "causal" with "etiological". The statement "Although 'etiology' has impeccable credentials, both lexical and etymological, for the use I have given it here, it is worth mentioning that this use was suggested to me by the role the word 'etiology' plays in the field of medicine" (p. 25) also links "causal" with "etiological" since "etiology" in medicine refers to causal antecedents of a disease. However, the passage ". . . the causal/teleological dis- tinction is a distinction among etiologies, rather than between etiologies and something else . . ." (p. 27) and its repetition (p. 57) imply that some etiologies are causal and some are not and suggest that teleological relations are not causal at all. On the other hand, Wright also uses "cause" in the ordinary sense. Speaking of the causal link in teleological and nonteleological settings, he says, "But the dependency is exactly the same: it is the usual sort of causal link, demonstrated using the same meth- odological principles" (p. 58). A part of the usual sort of causal link is that the effect does not occur before the cause. Finally, Wright regards the ordinary concept of causation as primitive: "... nowhere in the literature is there an analysis of cause-simple or complex-that captures enough of the concept to be a workable substitute for the notion itself in any context in which it plays a significant role" (p. 33). If the ordinary concept of causation is retained as an unanalyzed primitive, then an ordinary feature of that concept is also retained-that the effect does not precede the cause. This merely denies reverse causation; it does not show how it is to be prevented. Wright's use of "causal" is ambiguous enough that one can find textual support for any of several interpretations. Insofar as he uses "causal" or "broadly causal" in the unusual sense of meaning explanatory only, saying that teleological explanations are causal or broadly causal merely makes the tautological claim that teleological explanations are explanations. Insofar as he uses "causal" or "broadly causal" to mean explanatory of origins, saying</page><page sequence="4">LOWELL NISSEN In the second stage of the argument, providing for teleological language for nonhuman subjects, Wright extends teleological language to nonhu- man subjects by claiming a selective transfer of properties by means of the mechanism of metaphor. In general, I will argue that the feature of human teleology which transfers to nonhuman cases is the fact that when we say 'A in order that B', the relationship between A and B plays a role in bringing about A. It is this which is being pointed out, rather than intelligence and conscious purpose. In fact, just as in many of the nonteleological cases we have examined, it is usually so bizarre to suppose conscious intent in the nonhuman cases that nobody is seriously misled .... At the same time, since there is clearly no reversal of cause and effect in human cases, this argument in terms of metaphorical extension should have no tendency whatever to license such reversal in non- human cases (p. 21). The argument so far is that teleological language, having its origin in descriptions of human behavior, is extended to nonhuman cases by the mechanism of metaphor. The metaphor transmits only the claim that the behavior occurred because of the consequences, i.e., the claim of con- sequence-etiology. Thus, teleological language can legitimately be used to describe the behavior of nonhuman organisms because the part which transfers is nonmentalistic. Teleological language can be used to describe the behavior of organisms that are not assumed to have intentions, pur- poses, or goals because the metaphor does not transmit reference to in- tentions, purposes, or goals. However, more problems have now arisen. First, if reference to con- sequence-etiology is not present in teleological descriptions of human behavior, it can hardly be metaphorically transmitted to teleological de- scriptions of nonhuman behavior. Either teleological descriptions of non- human behavior do not imply the claim of consequence-etiology or that claim has another source. Second, it was precisely the having of a goal or purpose in the example of a person buying bread which Wright utilized to remove the threat of reverse causation. If, when teleological expression is metaphorically ex- tended to nonhuman cases, reference to the having of a goal or purpose drops out, then the problem of reverse causation is reinstated, for the that teleological explanations are causal or broadly causal is to claim that teleological ex- planations are explanations of origins. This gives only a preliminary description and does not reveal how consequences can determine behavior without involving reverse causation. Finally, insofar as he holds that a consequence-etiological account is based on the ordinary concept of causation, he merely denies reverse causation. Once again, the problem of how to avoid reverse causation is not addressed. 154</page><page sequence="5">TELEOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 155 very element used to prevent the implication of reverse causation has been removed. Thus, although Wright expresses indignation with analyses which imply reverse causation, his own analysis seems vulnerable to that charge. His analysis of teleological statements such as "The rabbit runs through the hole in the fence in order to escape the dog" removes the very element used to prevent the implication of reverse causation in such statements as "I went to the store to get some bread". Third, Wright, without supporting argument, simply declares that in the metaphorical extension to nonhuman subjects, the reference to pur- pose and goal drops out. This is a critical part of the argument and should not have been left as an assumption. It is clear from work in action theory as well as from a quick survey of human behavior that purposes and goals need not be conscious. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that in many cases of nonteleological metaphor, reference to the conscious and sentient as- pects of human experience are precisely the parts transferred. The state- ment "The wind caressed the trees" suggests the sensation of gentle touch. In saying, "The trees bent wearily beneath their burden of ice", the ache of fatigue is intimated. "The wind sighed mournfully about the eaves" conveys the feelings of sorrow and loss. Sensations, aches, feel- ings, and emotions are all conscious and sentient states. Thus, meta- phorical transference of reference to such states is not rare. Although the above statements are metaphorical, they are not, of course, teleological. Metaphorical statements which are also teleological include such statements as "The clouds chased each other across the sky", "The wind searched out the cracks in the cabin wall", and "The ivy encircled the crumbling walls in order to prevent the old building's collapse". It is the suggestion of purpose and goal that gives these state- ments their point, for denying such reference produces incoherence. To say that the clouds chased each other but were not trying to catch each other is self-contradictory. To say that the wind searched out the cracks but was not trying to find the cracks or that the ivy encircled the walls in order to prevent the old building's collapse but was not trying to pre- vent that collapse is nonsense. Expressions such as "trying to catch", "trying to find", and "trying to prevent" clearly refer to goals and the behavior directed to reaching them. It is apparent, therefore, that refer- ence to purpose and goal in these sample metaphorical teleological state- ments did not drop out. If they did not drop out here, there is no reason to assume without supporting argument that they would have dropped out in the metaphorical teleological statements which Wright alleges were the ancestors of literal teleological descriptions of goal-directed behavior of nonhuman subjects. The third and final stage of Wright's argument providing for teleolog- ical descriptions of the behavior of nonhuman subjects is that the meta-</page><page sequence="6">LOWELL NISSEN phor has become a dead metaphor. No one claims that there are any limits to the legitimate use of teleological expressions which are used purely metaphorically. Not only the behavior of lower organisms, but also the inanimate behavior of rock slides, crystal growth, and receding galaxies can be quite properly described in teleological language if the language is used purely metaphorically. The only interesting question regarding the teleological description of the behavior of lower organisms is whether such descriptions can be used literally. Wright, aware of this, provides for literal teleological descriptions of nonhuman subjects by claiming that the metaphor has become a dead metaphor. "It will be the central con- tention of this essay that teleological expressions in most nonhuman ap- plications represent dead anthropomorphic metaphors" (p. 21). Tying teleological descriptions of nonhuman behavior to dead metaphors pro- vides an explanation for the fact that, although anything can be described in metaphorical teleological language, only some things, e.g., the growth of plants but not the growth of crystals, can be described in literal teleo- logical language. As noted earlier, the part transferred by the mechanism of dead met- aphor which plays a central role in Wright's analysis is that which claims consequence-etiology, that the behavior occurs because of the conse- quence it has. As Wright expresses it, the part ". .. which transfers to nonhuman cases is the fact that when we say 'A in order that B', the relationship between A and B plays a role in bringing about A"(p. 21). Wright summarizes his analysis of teleological descriptions of goal-di- rected behavior as follows: "S does B for the sake of G iff: (i) B tends to bring about G [and] (ii) B occurs because (i.e., is brought about by the fact that) it tends to bring about G" (p. 39). A final difficulty with Wright's analysis of teleology is that it cannot account for teleological description of most behavior directed toward im- possible goals; specifically, it cannot account for unrequired behavior directed toward such goals. The term "tends" in the summary formula above is interpreted broadly, meaning ". .. brings about, is the type of thing that brings about, tends to bring about, is required to bring about, or is in some other way appropriate for bringing about . . ." (pp. 38- 39). Although one feels uneasy about the imprecision introduced into the analysis by such a broad interpretation of "tends", it does enable the formula to handle ordinary goal failure. The formula can, for example, handle the sentence "The rabbit ran into the woods in order to escape the dogs" even though that behavior is not always successful. However, behavior is sometimes directed toward completely impossi- ble goals, such as attempts to lift oneself by one's bootstraps or find the fountain of youth or build a perpetual motion machine. Indeed, ordinary instances of goal failure can be described in sufficient detail so as to 156</page><page sequence="7">TELEOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 157 render the goal impossible. Wright's own example of a fleeing rabbit will serve. Clearly, much teleological behavior does not guarantee the achieve- ment of its goal, and some of it is plainly unsuccessful. The fence might be too far away to reach safely, or the hole might be too small, or even covered by plate glass. Nevertheless, the behavior in such cases could still be 'for the sake of' or 'in order to' escape (p. 38). However, if the fence is always too far away or the hole always too small or always covered with stout glass, running toward it to escape will never be successful.2 Probability of success can always be eliminated from a constructed example by making the example such that the behavior consistently fails because success is logically or physically impossible. With probability of success zero, it is incorrect to say that the behavior "brings about", "is the type of thing that brings about", or "tends to bring about" the goal in question. Further, since no action an organism can perform can serve as a means to a genuinely impossible goal, no behavior can be said to be "appropriate" for that goal. Attempts to build a perpetual motion machine were always predicated on the belief that such a machine was possible, for as soon as that belief ceased, the at- tempts also ceased. Indeed, to continue the attempts would be regarded as so inappropriate as to indicate irrationality. Any behavior directed toward an impossible goal that is also not re- quired for that goal will be a counterexample to Wright's summary for- mula. The examples of behavior that might be performed in order to find the fountain of youth or to construct a perpetual motion machine but are not required to do so form an indefinitely large class. Ponce de Leon landed on the east coast of Florida in order to locate the fountain of youth, but he could have landed on the west coast to do so. Somerset of Worces- ter built a wheel fourteen feet in diameter for his perpetual motion ma- chine, but he might have built a wheel thirteen feet in diameter for that purpose. One might vigorously sand and buff a substance in order to produce a perfectly frictionless plane. However, the recollection that the crystallization of certain liquids can produce planes with lower friction than can sanding and buffing, not to mention the use of lubricating films, reminds us that sanding and buffing are not required. It is incorrect to say that sanding and buffing bring about, are the type of things that bring about, or tend to bring about a perfectly frictionless plane. Because the 2Curiously, in an earlier article, Wright criticized Braithwaite for failing to provide for impossible goals: ". . it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that there might be oc- casions on which we would say a system manifested purposive behavior even though, given its initial state, it was nominally impossible for it to achieve the goal to which it aspired" (Wright 1968, p. 217).</page><page sequence="8">LOWELL NISSEN goal is to produce a perfectly frictionless plane and not merely a plane with less friction than before, sanding and buffing are not even appro- priate, as evidenced by the fact that, as soon as it is realized that the goal is impossible, the sanding and buffing immediately cease. Under these conditions, the teleological statement is true but the analysis is false. Wright's analysis of teleological description of goal-directed behavior is thus defective in several ways. His analysis of what he and most others consider the clearest class of teleological descriptions displays antecedent- etiology, not, as he claimed, consequence-etiology. This makes it im- possible, contrary to his claim, for reference to consequence-etiology to be metaphorically transmitted to descriptions of nonhuman behavior. His analysis does not succeed in avoiding the threat of reverse causation, for the method of preventing it in the human case is not available where intentional states cannot be assumed. No evidence is presented to support his claim that reference to having a purpose or goal drops out in meta- phorical extension; indeed, examples were found to suggest the opposite. Finally, the formula that summarizes his analysis of teleological descrip- tion of goal-directed behavior cannot accommodate teleological descrip- tion of unrequired behavior directed toward impossible goals.
