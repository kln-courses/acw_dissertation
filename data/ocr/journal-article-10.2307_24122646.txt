A survey of soils for aggregate stability and glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi S.F. Wright and A.

Accepted in revised version 30 October 1997 Key words: AM fungi; soil biology, soil protein, sustainable agriculture, water stable aggregates Abstract Understanding the contributions of soil microorganisms to soil stabilization at the molecular level will lead to ways to enhance inputs for sustainable agricultural systems. Recent discoveries of copious production of glycoprotein (glomalin) by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and the apparent recalcitrance of this material in soils led to the comparison between concentration of glomalin and aggregate stability. Stability was measured on air-dried aggregates rewetted by capillary action and then subjected to wet sieving for 10 min. Thirty-seven samples from four geographic areas of the U.S. and one area of Scotland were tested. The monoclonal antibody used to discover glomalin on AM hyphae was employed to assess immunoreactive glomalin on aggregate surfaces by immunofluo rescence and in extracts from aggregates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunofluorescence was observed on at least some surfaces of aggregates from all soils examined, but was most evident on aggregates with high glomalin concentrations. Easily extractable glomalin (EEG) was solubilized by 20 mMcitrate, pH 7.0 at 121 °C for 30 min, and total glomalin (TG) was solubilized with 50 mM citrate, pH 8.0 at 121 °C for 90 to 450 min. Some soils required up to seven sequential extractions to remove all of the glomalin. Aggregate stability was linearly correlated (p &lt; 0.001) with all measures of glomalin (mg/g of aggregates) in these soils. The best predictor of aggregate stability (AS) was immunoreactive easily extractable glomalin (IREEG) according to the following relationship: AS = 42.7 +61.3 x logio IREEG (r2 = 0.86; p &lt;0.001, n= 37). Introduction et al. (1986) and Oades (1993) reviewed the evidence for biological involvement in aggregate stabilization.

The necessi- ganisms, and anthropomorphic influences along with ty to identify the reactive material led to use of the different soil textures, harsh and stringent extraction mentioned above. Such unusual conditions for extraction suggested that this molecule is very stable.

Results Photomicrographs of immunoreactive material (IM) on aggregates from Cecil soil are shown in Figure 1. The reaction was typical of FITC immunofluorescence (i.e. bright apple green) and is shown in Figure 1A as white areas. IM is highly concentrated on the aggregate in some areas. In Figure IB hyphae (H) are attached to an aggregate and IM on the surface of hyphae can be seen. Diameter of these hyphae indicate that these are within the size range of AM fungal hyphae (2 8 fim). Immunoreactive material on hyphae of Gigas pora gigantea MA453A is shown in Figure 1C for comparison. Many small circular pieces of IM, appar ently sloughed from hyphae, also are present. Horticul tural film pieces that had not been used in pot cultures or were tested with reagent controls showed no fluo rescence. There was variation in the amount of IM on aggre gates from different soils, but, in general, at least some of the surface of aggregates from all samples tested had IM. There was an observed correlation between high concentration of extracted immunore active glomalin and the amount of immunoreactive material on the surface of aggregates. Controls showed no immunofluorescence and autofluorescent material was easily distinguished from IM because of color (yellow) or texture. Some individual particles within aggregates, identified by size and surface smoothness as sand, had a green autofluorescence in controls. The smooth appearance of the entire fluorescent particle readily distinguished autofluorescence from the rough patchiness characteristic of IM associated with gloma lin. Table 2 shows correlation coefficients for fractions of glomalin, percent carbon in aggregates, and aggre gate stability. All fractions of glomalin were highly correlated with each other and with aggregate stability of soil samples.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) value (A405) for 0.125 pg of protein compared with the ELISA value of the same amount of glomalin from Gigaspora gigantea MA453A was used to calculate the concentration of immunoreactive glomalin in extracts. This value was extrapolated to mg immunoreactive glomalin/g aggregates. c The value is the mass of aggregated soil remaining as a percent of the total mass of soil after 10 min of wet sieving. immunoreactive glomalin was extracted by the longer Soils used in this study were from different geo heating cycle for TG. graphic locations and had different textural character Total glomalin in some clays may be very abundant, istics.
