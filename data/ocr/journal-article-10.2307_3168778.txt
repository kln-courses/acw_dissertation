<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Robeck has ably defended the presumed predecessors of modern Pentecos- tals. He reminds us that very orthodox churchmen can share in the world of dreams and visions (Ignatius of Antioch shows the same thing, without benefit of Montanism). The only item I can add to the extensive bibliography is Frederick C. Klawiter's unpublished 1975 Chicago dissertation, "The New Prophecy in Early Christianity: The Origin, Nature and Development of Montanism, A.D. 165-220," which deserves mention because it is not limited to evidence from Carthage. Chicago, Illinois ROBERT M. GRANT The Origenist Controversy: The Cultural Construction of an Early Christian Debate. By ELIZABETH A. CLARK. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. xii + 287 pp. $45.00. This fine book combines social and theological themes in discussing the fate of some of Origen's major ideas in the centuries soon after his death. The first chapter is concerned with "elite networks and heresy accusations," with an analysis of the complex interrelations among Origen's supporters and foes that reminds us of the late Ronald Syme's studies of the early Roman empire. The second chapter deals with Origen's idea of God as further developed by Evagrius Ponticus against the literalist "anthropomorphites." As Clark notes, several important bishops thought Epiphanius shared this heresy (compare Socrates, Church History 6.7-10). We then turn to the main charges against Origenism as leveled by Epiphanius, Theophilus of Alexandria, Jerome, and Shenute of Atripe. "Four polemicists, four Origenisms-but ... little sense of either Origenism's theological appeal or its coherence" (p. 158): four of the most unpleasant people in the early church. Therefore we turn to Rufinus's defense of Origenism, and finally to the transition from Origenism to Pelagianism. The comments on Epiphanius could be supplemented from Aline Pourkier's L'Heresiologie chez Epiphane de Salamine (Paris: Beauchesne, 1992), but this book appeared too late for use and would change little that Clark has said. Clark also insists that theological questions are important, though Ori- genists and their foes who sought a system in Origen's thought were not well advised, as Henry Courzel has argued. We note that Origen's theology would have seemed more obscure had some of his later homilies been known in the East. He really relaxed his rigidly anti-anthropomorphic vision of God and admitted human-like emotions in the deity (Father as well as Son) in some late homilies, but these writings survived in a Latin version presumably unknown to Greek opponents or to Greek Origenists like Evagrius. While in his homilies on Numbers (16.3; 23.2) Origen still held that God does not really rejoice and grieve, by the time he came to Ezekiel (Homily 6.6)- 379</page><page sequence="2">CHURCH HISTORY perhaps influenced by his reading of Ignatius-he said that even the Father "experiences human passions." In the extant Latin version this is humanas sustinet passiones, equivalent to the Greek paschein or pathein ti anthropinon, as in the Commentary on Matthew 15.16 and 16.1; patiens aliquid humanum in Latin there. In other words, the ancient differentiation of anthropomorphic/ nonanthropomorphic does not fit either scripture or Origen's thought- which was something in motion, not fixed. As for Epiphanius, it is significant that he drags up charges against "Gnostics" and applies them to certain "Origenians," even though he admits he has no ideas who that "Origen" might be (Heresies 63). For the real Origen he supplies even more scandal than the absurd story Clark criticizes (p. 91): his patron Ambrose, they say, was a Marcionite or a Sabellian, while there are those who claim he took drugs to improve his memory (Heresies 64.3.1,12). In social history, I found especially interesting Theophilus's claim that Origenist monks opposed his attack on the temple of Serapis (p. 109, n. 183, citing Jerome Epistles 92.3.2). (Epiphanius had said that Origen attacked this temple, Heresies 64.1,4.) Unfortunately Jerome's editor Hilberg marked what they said as "gravely corrupted." But at least Theophilus thought the monks could be accused of such disgraceful moderation. We also note Clark's suggestion (p. 104, n. 145) that when the enigmatic Joseppus locates Anthro- pomorphites at Eleutheropolis in Palestine he is veiling an attack on Epipha- nius. This may be so, but Joseppus owes an immense debt to Epiphanius for his information about oriental heresies, not to Epiphanius directly but to whoever wrote the rather vapid summaries of each chapter. Chicago, Illinois ROBERT M. GRANT Rufinus of Aquileia and the "Historia Ecclesiastica," Lib. VIII-IX, of Eusebius. By TORBEN CHRISTENSEN. Historisk-filosofiske Meddelelser 58. Copenhagen: Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 1989. 339 pp. DDK 450,00 paper. This work by Torben Christensen is a posthumous contribution to the study of both Eusebius of Caesarea and Rufinus of Aquileia. Christensen has built upon the critical studies of Eduard Schwartz and Richard Laqueur in his investigation of books eight and nine of Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History. Both earlier scholars recognized and demonstrated the textual problems presented by Eusebius in these two books. Clearly, this section of the Ecclesiastical History has been reworked repeatedly by its author. Christensen was convinced that what was needed was a thorough internal criticism of Eusebius's text. His methodology was as follows. First, he would seek to discover the connection between individual sections. Then he would endeavor to establish whether these sections displayed features suggesting 380</page></plain_text>
