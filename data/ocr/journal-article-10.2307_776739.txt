<plain_text><page sequence="1">Museum News Rose R. Weil Editor Art ofAztec Mexico "The greenstone jar once stank of blood. It now sits almost prettily in a case of plastic . ." So begins the review in the Washington Post of the Art ofAztec Mexi- co: Treasures of Tenochtitlan exhibition at the National Gallery of Art (September 8, 1983-April 1, 1984). The article goes on to discuss in great detail human sacrifice and cannibalism, both of which it attrib- utes to protein deficiency, based on ideas extensively popularized a few years ago by Michael Harner and Marvin Harris. Aztec art is compared to the art of the Assyrians, Romans, and Egyptians ("King Tutankh- amen's treasures caused us to imagine the softness of the Pharaoh's clothes, the genius of his cooks"), to Goya, Caravaggio, recent German and New York painting, and horror movies ("But the darkest of Western art-because it is too passionate, angry, self-indulgent, dreamy, or amusing -pales in comparison"). The reviewer concludes with the observation that the cult of death continues in modem Mexican culture in all the grinning skulls made of paper and candy for the Catholic Day of the Dead and he approves of the humor and joy inherent in these objects. In effect, he reaffirms the evil character of the Aztecs and contrasts it with the greater humanity of Western civilization. It would seem that in the popular press we have not gone much beyond the heated sixteenth-century debates in which the issue was whether the natives in the New World were human and had souls worth saving or were subhuman and therefore rightfully conquered and enslaved. The National Gallery, the organizers of the exhibition, the authors of the cata- logue, and the Mexican embassy and gov- ernment officials in charge of the loans were surprised and dismayed by this reac- tion in the press. For the National Gallery, this was a chance to exhibit a great art style Fig. I Colossal Jaguar Cuauhxicalli (vessel for human hearts) (Cat. p. 30), andesite, length 88 %5/", width 471/4", height 36%/8".

The Aztec exhibition is in the tradi- tion of museums searching for "new" art-art not already popularized and appre- ciated by the public. Entitled Treasures of Tenochtitlan, it was one in a long series of "Treasures" exhibitions already shown here and stretched the term "treasure" beyond its limits to include primarily stone sculpture often of colossal size. For Mexi- cans, the exhibition was a recognition by the United States that Mexico had a great art in its pre-Columbian heritage and that this art is important for the modern Mexican national consciousness and feeling of self- worth. Finally, for scholars dealing with pre-Columbian art, it was a recognition by a foremost United States museum, gener- ally dedicated to Western art, that pre- Columbian sculpture was fine enough to be exhibited there. Of the recent major pre-Columbian exhibitions, this was the only one not designed to attract the public by quantities of spectacular gold. It was another step in the struggle to give non- Western arts a legitimate place in our cul- tural life, a recognition still generally re- sisted by museums and art history depart- ments in universities. I should like to state at the outset that the exhibition and cata- logue represent points of view somewhat different from mine. Whatever anyone's expectation of Aztec art was, the exhibition was a rewarding experience and, even for many pre-Colum- bianists, something of a revelation. Some of the finest Aztec art works had been brought together for the first time from Mexico, Europe, and the United States, making it possible to have a clear sense of the mastery and power of Aztec style. Although not every large object of Aztec art could be brought to Washington, the ones that are there, thanks to the curatorial efforts of Elizabeth Boone of Dumbarton Oaks, in- clude some of the most precious and im- portant. As I entered the hall, I felt dwarfed by a colossal crouching jaguar placed on a low pyramidal platform (Fig. 1). The sculpture conveyed not the swiftness of the feline, but its massive power. Smoothly polished, bulging shapes evoked organic muscles without literal depiction. Convex forms next to each other meeting at sharp lines suggested the potential of life and movement despite a rigid bilateral sym- metry. Elegant curving lines represented features without fussy detail or ornamenta- tion. Large eyes, an open mouth full of fangs, and paws with claws expressed clearly the predatory and destructive quali- ties the jaguar symbolized. The sculpture inspired fear and awe because of its size and weight, its subject, and the sense of pent-up power animating stone. It was not grotesque, in that its creator did not search for effect in exaggeration of posture, grim- ace, or caricature. Considering the subject, 390 Art Journal</page><page sequence="2">it is remarkable for its simplicity, serious- ness, and even restraint. Stepping up on the platform on which the jaguar sat, one could see a circular cavity inside the animal's back, on the bottom of which two figures are carved in low relief (Fig. 2). One had to read the label and to look at a drawing in order to discern all the details. Each of the figures has a skeletal jaw, an elaborate headdress, and one foot ending in an emblem known as a smoking mirror. The figures are shown drawing blood from their ears with sharp- ened bones. Speech scrolls emerge from their mouths and ceramic incense burners are depicted at their feet. Our knowledge of Aztec iconography is still hazy enough so that we are not certain whether they are gods, divine kings (living or deceased), men dressed as gods, or concepts given anthropomorphic form. Despite the subject of self-torture, the figures are inward- turned and self-contained. The emphasis is not on emotion but on the linear definition of costume and symbolic insignia. Other works exhibited near the jaguar combine various dramatically modeled forms in three dimensions with complex low-relief imagery; for example, three magnificent greenstone objects: a sacrificial vessel from Berlin (Cat. 3), a so-called pulque beaker from Vienna (Cat. 14), and a box from Hamburg (Cat. 15). Each of these objects is carved on the inside, the outside, and the bottom with complex his- torical and mythological iconography. This group alone made the exhibition worth visiting. The National Gallery has done the ut- most to enhance the aesthetic contempla- tion of the objects in this exhibition.

Each room had its dramatic focal point either in a single object, such as the newly found life-size eagle knight (Cat. 24) in the second room, or in a group, such as the stone serpents piled on a pyramidal plat- form in the third room. Small and precious objects lined cases along the walls; they included gold, pottery, turquoise mosaic, obsidian, and featherwork. The arrange- ment of the objects in the exhibition was, like Aztec art, eloquent in its symmetry and simplicity. This elegant presentation had an unusual effect on the viewer. Regardless of what their functions once were, the objects now plead the cause of the Aztecs in the name of art as a universal form of human expres- sion. Are we to enjoy the exquisiteness of the Aztec rendering of fangs in the same way as we appreciate the illusion of crystal and a half-peeled lemon in a painting by Kalf? (This problem is inherent in the modern museum's exhibiting ancient art. It works best with art that was intended for burial, such as so much of Egyptian art, because the museum itself has the aura of a mausoleum.) One would not wish for a scenic presentation-replete with photo- graphs and models-that pretended to place the objects in their original context, as is customary in natural history museum dis- plays. Nor would one wish for an exhibition overburdened with texts and explanatory charts to make sense of all the complex iconography. Nevertheless, there is some- thing jarring in the presentation of objects for our aesthetic contemplation or even de- lectation when their original intention was not primarily aesthetic or contemplative. The sensation-seeking newspaper re- views reflect the contradiction presented by the museum display of Aztec art, but offer nothing but popular prejudice to counter it. The nonspecialist museumgoer turns in vain to the beautiful catalogue with its scholarly text written by H.B. Nicholson with the collaboration of Eloise Keber. In the tradition of the best museum catalogues, each entry details the collection history of each piece and gives fascinating anecdotal information. We learn, for exam- ple, that the Metropolitan's standard bearer (Fig. 3) had been nicknamed "Benito Juarez,'" after a former Mexican president of Indian ancestry, in 1903 by the people of the village where it was found, and that an Aztec obsidian mirror was used by Queen Elizabeth I's court astrologer for divination. Each piece is described and its iconography analyzed in painstaking detail. Since Nicholson is a scholar with a near encyclopedic knowledge of the Aztec, this work is a magnificent compendium of facts and a major resource for the specialist. The unwary reader is, however, treated to com- plex justifications of certain interpretations without being given a clear presentation of the issues in dispute among scholars. Nowhere does the catalogue address the issues of what makes Aztec art special and why it is worthy of our attention, except by dubbing it "great art." The issue of the horrifying is both played down and used for effect, but never explained. "The char- acterization of Aztec art as an art of the macabre has often been exaggerated, but this beautifully carved monument is one of the masterpieces of the genre," begins the entry on a platform Nicholson calls the "Stone of the Death Monsters" (Cat. 12). If Aztec scholars don't provide some com- Winter 1983 391</page><page sequence="3">prehensible explanation for practices that shock us, we should not be surprised that people will get their ideas from exploitative novels like Jenning's Aztec. Before we can talk rationally about Aztec art, we must deal with the problem of human sacrifice. It is easy to disapprove of human sacri- fice and to suggest that the Aztecs are, for this reason, beyond the pale of decent human beings. We can see them as the eternal "other" to the humanistic vision we have of ourselves. What appalls the Western sensibility is not so much the body counts-we are responsible for just as many innocent victims (take, for example, Hiro- shima)-but the idea of glorifying death and torture in the name of the gods. To understand the Aztec view, we must realize that violence in the name of religion is not foreign to us: saints became saints because of the violence of anti-Christian civil authorities, and their tortured bodies have often been the subject of Western art. (The idea that the saints could never have become saints without the agency of evil, and therefore that evil is necessary, has always been considered a heresy, but it has appeared from time to time: witness the Manicheans.) The same church that glori- fied the martyrdom of saints used similar means of torture on Protestants during the Inquisition. Generally, however, in our tradition, cruelty has been culturally ac- ceptable only if it was presented as "ra- tional" punishment of criminals or if it resulted from the exigencies of war. The Aztecs, in common with a number of other non-Western cultures, saw the world not as divided between good and evil but as a continuous cycle of birth and death, in a ceaseless alternation of being and nonbeing. The anxiety of the Aztecs, in particular, centered on the annihilation of the universe-nonbeing swallowing up being. Both birth and death could be seen as good and as sources of power and energy. In the act of human sacrifice, the power inherent in the person was taken away from him and given back to nature-to the rain gods so it would rain, to the sun god so he would rise in the morning. The act was seen as horrendous and ultimate and was therefore the most sacred ritual. Violence was accepted by the Aztecs not because rationally or practically it was sometimes necessary (as it is accepted by us), but only when it was ritualized in religion. Despite ideologies of human sac- rifice, head hunting, and the glorification of the warrior, most "savage" peoples were an easy prey for "humanistic" West- erners not only because of the superiority of weapons, but also because the Western- ers practiced nonritualized total war. Pre- Columbian warfare was ceremonious and inefficient. Combatants dressed in feather- covered overalls and were burdened with heraldic standards. The Aztecs wasted time and manpower on the battlefield to Fig. 5 Standing Fertility Goddess (Cat. 20), volcanic stone, height 26/4", width 10%/8", depth 5?2".

The above is, of course, the religious justification of human sacrifice that the Aztecs themselves would have used. We blame the Aztecs not for obeying their gods, but for inventing them. The question we must ask is not whether human sacrifice is right or wrong, but why such a custom, with its patently self-serving ideology, arose-what purpose did it serve? Which is related to the question of why Aztec art expresses so vividly, so seriously, and with such complexity the destructive forces of the universe. The answer is only partly found in religion and in the Byzantine vagaries of iconography. We must turn to social and political conditions and to his- tory for a fuller explanation. (Nor is the answer to be found in the Aztec diet, which was not protein-deficient and did not, thus, necessitate cannibalism. A diet of maize, beans, and squash-although it is vegetar- ian--contains all necessary proteins.) To begin with, the Aztecs did not invent sacrifice and its religious justification, but inherited it from earlier cultures. The peo- ples they conquered objected not to human sacrifice-they all practiced it-but to the number sacrificed, to excessive killing on the battlefield, or to what they considered "unusual" sacrifices. Mainly, they minded having to send economic tribute. Human sacrifice by the Aztecs and by other pre- Columbian peoples was used for an ulterior political purpose (although whether they were conscious of this is a matter of some debate). The Aztecs were not the absolute rulers of a totalitarian state; the ruling group consisted of an uneasy alliance of three cities to whom conquered territories paid tribute. Conquered territories were not incorporated into a bureaucratically organ- ized empire. They often rebelled, and much of Aztec warfare consisted of battles with the same enemies. Large areas within the "empire" were entirely unconquered, and periodic battles were fought with their populations to obtain sacrificial victims. Human sacrifice on a large scale was apparently devised by the Aztecs as a cost- effective measure in a form of psychologi- cal warfare, an idea similar to public exe- cution as a deterrent to crime. The Aztecs could not conquer and control the realm of Mesoamerican civilization militarily or economically; therefore, they tried to bully it into submission by displays of power. These power displays included parades of tribute bearers, lavish feasts and gift giv- ing, horrible sacrifices ostensibly for the gods, and impressive architectural com- plexes with numerous works of art. The art works of the capital and its temples were not made for collectors ornamenting their residences and interested in aesthetics. In a society without books, without television, and without even a system of writing be- yond simple glyphs, the large-scale sculp- tures were used to express, to justify, and even to augment the power of the state. The sculptures were meant to be large, awesome, and intricate, but not necessarily beautiful. They were meant to instruct about the gods in whose names people ruled. Some of the images "actually" embodied the spirit of the gods, which Christianity denounced as "idolatry." These rituals and these sculptures were not necessarily made by a cynical and sec- ular elite. Although we can see that they were in part a form of political propaganda, they are not analogous to Soviet paintings of happy collective-farm workers on trac- tors. The religious doctrines about the na- ture of the world, about the necessity of human sacrifice, and about the state's task to save the cosmos from annihilation were truly believed in by the elite. This is indi- cated by the fact that the sculptures, for example, communicated not only with 392 Art Journal</page><page sequence="4">other people but also with the unseen powers of the universe; their undersides, which were generally not visible, were covered with images of the devouring earth demon waiting for a chance to destroy the world (Fig. 4). Rulers participated in ritual self-torture; they are depicted drawing blood from various parts of their bodies on reliefs and on boxes holding the instru- ments of sacrifice. What is particularly stiking about Aztec art is that this elite viewed the world as an insecure and destructive place. Aztec art is perhaps closest in spirit to Romanesque representations of the Last Judgment with their frightening depictions of a hell-mouth devouring the damned. Such a perception of the world among the Aztec elite was perhaps not entirely unrealistic: in Meso- america, kingdoms rarely lasted more than a few hundred years. The traditional found- ing date of Tenochtitlan is 1325 and most of the fine art was made in the forty years before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519. The ideology of constant warfare used as a cosmic metaphor may actually have hampered the consolidation of a more pragmatic state and an ideology of security. The Aztecs never realized that instead of sacrificing people they could have put them to productive work, as did the Inca, build- ing roads and weaving textiles. For the Aztec elite, the Spanish conquest was a long-expected Armageddon come true, and their ideology prevented them from putting up a "rational" defense. Neither this exhibition nor catalogue makes clear that the world view usually thought of as Aztec was in fact primarily that of the elite. The sculptures intended for the smaller temples and the clay figu- rines of rural peasants are surprisingly free of the skull-and-fang imagery. The exhibi- tion has a few fine sculptures of these popular nature deities, the rain, water, wind, and maize gods and goddesses, who sit or stand in calm postures without elabo- rate iconographic constructs covering their bodies. The maize goddess (Fig. 5) is known in hundreds of carvings, ranging from crude provincial work to finely pol- ished images. Her headdress represents the inexpensive paper headdress with rosettes and streamers that the priest impersonating the goddess wore in rituals. The Berlin Museum example chosen is one of the finest and most complex. Because this exhibition is devoted to "treasures," the mass-produced clay figu- rines made for household altars are not represented. The most common of these figurines is a female carrying a child in her arms. Works of art make clear that Aztec society was not a homogeneous whole; the art of the Temples of Tenochtitlan, of the local temples of nature gods, and of the household were all different in form and iconography. The exhibition and catalogue perpetuate the notion that the art and ideol- Fig. 6 Underside of a Coiled Rattlesnake (Cat. 51), stone, height 11", diameter 317/s". Mexico City, Museo Nacional de Antropologia, no. 24-1375, 11-3011. ogy of the elite is the art and ideology of an entire people. It can be argued that elite art always seeks to be the antithesis of popular art and that the two make sense only in relation to each other. If we had only descriptions of Aztec ritual and religion and no surviving art, we might imagine that the lost art had been gruesome, expressionistic, much like the representations of human sacrifice painted for Europeans in the sixteenth century by converted natives. It is just such an illus- tration that the Washington Post used in its article. The restraint and even understate- ment of Aztec art as seen in the Metropoli- tan's standard bearer (see Fig. 3) or in the many serpent images (Fig. 6), simply but meticulously carved both on top and on the underside, are unexpected. The Washing- ton Post reviewer found this aspect partic- ularly chilling. Why are these forms so quiet, smooth, controlled? Why aren't they screaming? Even the colossal jaguar is self- contained despite its maw full of fangs. The answer is that these carvings were not made by individualistic artists expressing their feelings about a subject. We try to control our universe by machines; the Aztecs sought to control theirs through art. The Aztec artists are comparable to the designers who make our technologically most valuable objects-airplanes, rockets, and spacecraft. While we may, if we wish, look on those objects and discern aesthetic values in them, to do so would be to trivi- alize their primary purpose. The best of Aztec art has the seriousness, appropriate- ness, and fearful power of what we consider technological design in modern life.
