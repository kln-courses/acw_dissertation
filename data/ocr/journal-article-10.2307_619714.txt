<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN YORUBA POTTERY By P. ALLSWORTH-JONES McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, Cambridge Contemporary Yoruba pottery Mrs. A.K. Fatunsin's Yoruba pottery (Lagos, 1992) is the outcome of a project funded by the Ford Foundation (grant no. 875-1066) as part of its continuing programme 'to preserve and interpret diverse aspects of West Africa's cultural heritage'. The intention of the project as suggested to them in 1985 by this author was that it should 'go beyond the mere collection of artefacts'. Emphasis was to be 'placed on techniques of pottery manufacture, sources and types of raw material, methods of forming the pots, decoration and firing, as well as forms and functions including the designated names for the pots in the different parts of the Yoruba speaking area.' Also investigated would be the uses to which the pots were put; and the organization, beliefs and customs of the potters themselves. The monograph resulting from the work would be designed to show pots 'not just as art objects but as basic components of the entire economic, social, and religious life of the people '. As it happens, this approach coincided very largely with the one also advocated at the time by Dr. Philip Ravenhill, then based in Abidjan as Director of the International African Institute's West African Museums Project. He criticized common Western approaches to the study of African art objects (among which we may include pottery) and suggested an agenda for Africa's museums (Ravenhill, 1987). 'Western research on African art has tended to focus on single art products, instead of material culture complexes.' By contrast, 'the true preservation of national cultural heritage' involves 'the preservation not only of the objects themselves but the knowledge of their artists and clients, their social history, their meaning, their function and use-in short, the total range of extrinsic information that is crucial to a real understanding of the art forms.' The Ford Foundation project is a study of a material culture complex in the sense defined by Ravenhill. The project was executed for the most part in 1989-91 by Mrs. Fatunsin and her colleagues in the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments, particularly Mr. E. O. Abejide and Mr. P. G. Ajekigbe, and the monograph incorporates the results of their and my own work. It also builds of course on the work of our predecessors, especially Sylvia Leith-Ross (1970), Maude Wahlman (1972), Ann O 'Hear (1986), and Georgina and Ulli Beier. The last two assembled an important collection of Yoruba pots which formed the basis for the Museum of Yoruba Pottery opened at Ita-Yemoo in Ile-Ife on 11 February 1973 (G. Beier, 1980). This collection contains a number of items which it would be difficult to equal today, in particular, a magnificent set of Sango pots said to have been purchased from a trader in Ibadan in 1966. Readers must form their own opinion of the monograph and the extent to which it achieves the objectives of the project, and I would like to emphasize here certain aspects only. Much attention is devoted, as intended, to the dominant techniques of pottery making, which are termed the 'direct' and 'indirect' methods. The indirect method involves the use of a 'pre-mould' to form the base of the pot which is then completed by coiling, and very large vessels indeed (as at Saki and Ilaro) can be made by this method. Pot formation from the rim is regarded as a variant of the direct method, and is practised</page><page sequence="2">CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN YORUBA POTTERY 313 with exceptional virtuosity at Erusu and Oke-Agbe, as well as by neighbours of the Yoruba, such as the Gun people of the Badagry area. As is well known, firing is usually carried out on an open bonfire, but this is by no means a random operation, and pots may undergo 'preheating' beforehand. Less well known is the fact that in some cases kilns are employed, as at Abeokuta and Ipetumodu, and that large pots may be used to fulfil this function, as at Ilorin. Ilorin is famous both for its 'red' and its 'black' wares, the latter the result of' basting' in a liquid derived from the bark and pods of such trees as Bridelia ferruginea and Parkia biglobosa. Basting in general is a process instrumental in helping to define regional styles as well as functional classes of pots, though use of a solution derived from fermented cassava is unique to the Ijebu area. Mrs. Fatunsin and her colleagues have defined seven common types of pots in use among the Yoruba, each with their distinctive names, though in fact several of these categories are further subdivided, and there is evidently a certain fluidity in the classification. As she says, 'the form of a pot is generally determined by the purpose it is to serve ', but 'form does not necessarily limit the uses to which a pot may be put.' Hence, although she does also list an alternative classification by function, in general 'form has been used to categor- ize the pots described' in this work. It is a familiar archaeological conundrum. Thus ritual and ceremonial pots, to which a particularly well illustrated and informative section of the book relates, 'are easily identified by their decorative motifs ', but they can 'take any form', and the majority of those discussed are also described in terms of the general categories employed such as oruz, isaaszn, amz, and ikrkr. Many of the subdivisions of these categories, with their distinctive names, reflect the different uses to which they are put. Thus, one variety of isaasuzn is used for burying newborn babies' placenta; another (broken immediately after use) for medicinal soups; and another exclusively for charms. Ikrka (essentially large storage vessels) are likewise subdivided according to their employment in local soap-making or dyeing processes, in the fermenting of cassava or yam, and in the production of palm kernel oil, as well as other foodstuffs. Some of the factors mentioned above reflect regional as well as functional variability, but more could probably have been made of the stylistic factors which help to mark off pots from different parts of Yorubaland. As Fatunsin says, 'the origin of a pot can generally be identified', and 'certain features distinguish the pots from the various areas.' Likewise, it is to be hoped that a more exhaustive study (going beyond the bounds that were envisaged for this work) will be carried out on the different raw materials employed in Yorubaland and the ways in which they are combined together in manufacture. As in every field of African studies, potential Ph.D. theses abound, and the application of scientific techniques in particular is to be desired. Continuity and change This study shows that in some respects the traditional pottery-making industry of the Yorubas in Nigeria is still strongly entrenched. As Mrs Fatunsin says, 'in most traditional industries and in food processing', the ikrk&amp; is preferred, and the same is true of the cmzi for keeping water cool. It is not only in the rural areas that 'people prefer traditional cooking pots', and, as the investigators of this project found out, even urban sophisticates appreciate the virtues of a well made dra or isaasan. The continued importance of ritual pottery in some areas, for example Abeokuta, is absolutely clear, although in others, for example Ilorin, it has practically disappeared. The work of Madam Simiatu Adeoye of Ile Oloye in the Ijaye quarter of Abeokuta is well illustrated</page><page sequence="3">314 P. ALLSWORTH-JONES : 4-4 ? ~ ~ ~ ? . . o.' . . . . . . . . :.; ?6 . ?

F. Thompson earlier described the work of Abatan, 'a master potter of the Egbado Yoruba', whom he studied in 1962-66 at her home town of Oke- Odan (Thompson, 1969). 'Two aspects of art, tradition and innovation, norm- ally held to be antithetical, form in her works a dynamic unity, that is, her art is embedded in culture and yet is autonomous ... . It is a tactful creativity, so that tradition seems set above the flux of time.' I think the same could be said of Madam Felicia Adepelu of Igbara-Odo, where the worship of Osun is as important as that of Erinle in Abeokuta (Ajayi, 1987). A similar dedication and skill in the production of utilitarian vessels is shown, for example, among the potters of the Okelele district in the north-western part of Ilorin, where both 'red' and 'black' wares are made, and have been made for many generations, in family compounds. Ile Malubi is one such compound, where Belawu Anafi and Ramatu Akanke together with their children and relations specialize in the making of isaasuzn and agbada respectively. Theirs is a high- precision but repetitive technique; asked why they made things this particular way, their reply was that they were following the practice of their grandmothers. Thus this work does not deviate in any way from tradition (fig. 2). None the less, there has undoubtedly been a tendency in recent years for the traditional pottery-making industry to contract, for reasons which are both technological and sociological. Imported and then home-made containers of different materials have provided serious competition, first enamel and porcel- ain, followed by aluminium and plastic. The survival of the industry depends</page><page sequence="4">CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN YORUBA POTTERY 315 ?i ......... ........... ...........::::::::: ...........iiiiiiiiiiiil- i FIG. 2 Ile Malubi, Okelele, Ilorin, 23 February 1985. Fatimeh burnishing the interior of an isaasun. on the continued influx of young girls as apprentices but, particularly during the oil boom years, this influx seemed to be in danger of drying up. Universal primary education (laudable though it may be in principle) seemed to offer a route to more prestigious and less 'dirty'jobs than the making of pots. Some formerly busy centres, such as Ilaro, have shrunk drastically as a result of these tendencies, and it is likely that the overall number of centres in Yorubaland will continue to decrease. The potters have adopted various strat- egies to try to combat these tendencies. At Ebu Dada ('Dada's Village') in Ilorin a successful strategy has been in operation for a long time, consisting essentially of streamlining their production and concentrating on certain pop- ular items for everyday use, such as ape of various kinds for cooking prepara- tions of yam or cassava flour (oka or ambld). In colonial times such wares were sent to Lagos by rail; now they go by lorry. Elsewhere, some new products have been introduced, such as the flower pots illustrated by Mrs. Fatunsin. As she emphasizes, however, the potters are 'not ready for a change in their basic technology'. Efforts to interest them in glazing or the potter's wheel have failed, as did earlier attempts in Abuja and Jos: those industries produce indeed fine wares, but they are totally removed from African traditional norms, and their purchasers are mainly expatriates. A less drastic, and therefore more interesting, deviation from traditional norms is provided by the work of Madam Adedoja Bamikole in the Irefin quarter of Isan-Ekiti, a town with a flourishing and distinctive traditional pottery industry. As Mrs. Fatunsin mentions, she is a 'virtuoso potter' who has added 'many divergent styles' to her repertoire. For the most part these are terracotta figurines, whether of crocodiles or of people playing ayo, and they proved very popular at the exhibition of her work which was held at the Institute of African Studies of the University of Ibadan in 1985. Technologically these works are not distinct from traditional wares, and they could be held to be not dissimilar to the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic designs applied to ritual pots in the Isan-Ekiti area. None the less their purpose is purely decorat-</page><page sequence="5">316 P.

F. Thompson's description would (for good or ill) no longer be apt in this case. Works such as this, like the glazed wares from Abuja and Jos, appeal to an urban elite, and presumably will be produced by no more than a minority of potters in the future. For the majority the way ahead probably lies in an accentuation of existing trends towards standardization and simplification, and an abandonment of minority forms such as the ceramic seats (ijoko/jokotofofo) or raphia wine collecting pots (agba oguro) formerly made in Ilorin and Ijebu-Imope respect- ively (fig. 3). So long as the traditional religion continues to flourish, however, there will still be a demand for much more elaborate pots as well, and it would be reasonable to expect that the traditional manufacturing norms which have been handed down from mother to daughter for many generations will have a long life yet.</page><page sequence="6">CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN YORUBA POTTERY 317 . . . . . .. .. ........... :---:- _::::::::::::::::,::: :-:_: iii::rjg?:i~ii~~ll jiliiiji :: ??:::::::-i-::--i ?::i;:-. iiiiii::ii i-iir=-i--- -: -- -- ? - i-:-:: :::::::::::::::::::::iiiiiiii?iiiiiiiiiiii ,: :::iii-ii-i-iii-iiii-iii: - ?--i---i::ii:?i:::_ : ...................... b: S'N'm? FIG. 4 Sacrificial offering (ebo) found during excavations at IITA Ibadan on 5 April 1980, consisting of two ground stone axes and the remains of two pots including one isaasin. Historical antecedents The knowledge which has been acquired of contemporary Yoruba pottery is obviously of significance in interpreting the remains of the past in this part of Nigeria, particularly since on many archaeological sites potsherds constitute by far the most abundant kind of evidence. In fact, it was the need to interpret such evidence unearthed during an excavation in Ibadan which provided the initial impetus to launch the enquiry which subsequently became the Ford Foundation project. This excavation took place within the grounds of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, where an experimental archae- ological reserve was established in 1970, thanks to an initiative by Thurstan Shaw, on the site of the abandoned village of Adesina Oja. Some house foundations and a rubbish mound were investigated by this author with the help of students and a large amount of material was recovered (ed. Momin, 1989). Since the site was occupied during the early and mid part of this century and it was in Ibadan, there is no doubt that it was a Yoruba settlement, and many of the material culture items recovered were immediately recognized by the students, including a sacrificial offering (ebo) containing two ground stone axes and the remains of two pots, including one isaastin (fig. 4). Later, I was particularly pleased to observe that, when making a large dye pot (iko6k3 aro) on order for us, one of the potters in the Okelele district of Ilorin, Iya Ibeji of Ile Karebu, included two bosses with triangular impressions by the rim in order to signify its function. This immediately served to elucidate the meaning</page><page sequence="7">318 P. ALLSWORTH-JONES r t4 -pie Af, (.... v.L~r ? " ,.,.:.'-m .... c-.'-"-- ..'

Garlake, 1977, fig. 13). of similar fragments found during the excavation, and on closer inspection it would no doubt be possible to find many other parallels. If this represents the recent end of the spectrum, we now know that pottery in Nigeria in general goes back more than 6000 years, and in the Yoruba- speaking area in particular, at least 5000 years. The earlier age determination comes from Borno where a site on the Bama ridge near Konduga has been dated at 4390+250 B.C. (Breunig, Garba, Waziri, 1992). The site contains pottery with 'rocker-stamped' or 'walking comb' decoration, which is also present at Daima in the lower part of the mound. At Iwo Eleru, north-west of Akure in Ondo State, Thurstan Shaw revealed a Late Stone Age succession with both aceramic and ceramic phases. A C14 date of 3620 + 60 B.C. correlates approximately with the first appearance of pottery at the site (Shaw's sub- period B1; Shaw and Daniels, 1984). The decoration on the pottery is 'comb- stamped', as known also from similar sites at Dutsen Kongba on the Jos plateau and Bosumpra in southern Ghana (Shaw, 1978-79). At the base of the sequence at Iwo Eleru were the badly preserved remains of a skeleton which has been dated at 9250+ 200 B.C. and classified as 'proto-Negroid' (Brothwell and Shaw, 1971). Obviously, neither the pottery nor the human remains at this site can be specifically linked to the Yoruba people, so all one can say at the moment is that Iwo Eleru provides some kind of bottom line in the area and that specifically Yoruba traits must have appeared at some point after this date. We owe the first recognition of such traits in the archaeological record to Frank Willett, who conducted preliminary investigations at Old Oyo, north- west of Ilorin, in 1956-57 (Willett, 1961, 1973). His work has been continued by Robert Soper in 1973-79 and by B. Agbaje-Williams from 1981 onwards</page><page sequence="8">CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN YORUBA POTTERY 319 (Soper, 1993; Agbaje-Williams, 1986; Calvocoressi and David, 1979; McIntosh and McIntosh, 1986). Willett distinguished two pottery types or wares, which he interpreted as representing probably two phases of occupation. 1. the 'Diogun phase. These wares are characterized by sandy paste, fawn/ grey-brown colour, and complex fluted rims. Willett's suggestion that this constituted the earliest phase was confirmed by Soper's subsequent excavation and C14 date of 1100 + 110 A.D. from site 0075/3, to which four further dates obtained by Agabje-Williams at site 00/1 have to be added, in stratigraphic order from top to bottom, as follows: A.D. 1140 + 80, 1050 + 80, 790 + 90, and 765 + 90. As Calvocoressi and David remark, the distribution of the 'Diogun style suggests the presence of a substantial settlement of &gt; 1 km2 before the construction of the wall system around the later town. 'Diogun ware occurs mainly on circular mounds to the north and west of the central group of hills, where there is less of the later settlement. The date(s) show that 'Ife was not the only town in western Nigeria' at that time. 2. the Mejiro phase. This phase, characterized by fine grey/black wares, was present in Mejiro cave above a Late Stone Age occupation. It was dated by Soper at site 0074/1 to A.D. 1300 + 80. The Mejiro style, as stated by Calvocoressi and David, corresponds to the main occupation of the city up to its abandonment and is associated with the remains of traditional Yoruba courtyard houses, which are more widely distributed than the 'Diogun ones. The pottery forms, as Willett ascertained, include both open bowls and isaasan (defined by him as 'a round-bottomed carinated bowl with everted rim, and a lid with concave centre bearing a knob '). Makers' marks were found inside some of the isaasuin lids, and Willett recorded that 'almost identical marks were found on modem Ilorin pottery bought in the market.' He suggested that the fine grey/black wares were 'clearly ancestral' to modern Ilorin pottery, and that the women potters from Old Oyo (after the collapse of the city in 1837) settled in or were taken to Ilorin and brought their traditions with them. Willett's work, apart from its intrinsic interest, is therefore important from the methodological angle, and allows one to see the potters of Ile Malubi in a new light. The suggestion of historical continuity at Old Oyo is reinforced by that at Ile-Ife, widely reputed to be the 'spiritual capital' of the Yoruba people. Thurstan Shaw (1978) lists 25 radiocarbon dates derived from seven excava- tions in the city. A time-bracket of c. A.D. 1100-1450 is thought reasonable for the 'potsherd pavement' period which is usually taken as marking the high point of its early development, although there is an important group of pre- pavement dates, most notably those from Orun Oba Ado from A.D. 560 to 990. Among the elements making up the corpus of so-called 'classical' Ife art, it is terracotta sculptures and 'naturalistic bronzes' that have attracted the most attention, ever since Frobenius unearthed them at the Olokun grove in 1910-11. In fact there are less than 30 'bronzes' and on the basis of seven TL dates obtained on their clay cores at Ita Yemoo and Wunmonije it seems that they appeared towards the end of the 'potsherd pavement' period, whereas the terracottas occur throughout. Obalara's Land and Woye Asiri, both excav- ated by P. S. Garlake and fully published by him, are by far the most informat- ive of the 'potsherd pavement' sites for our present purposes (Garlake, 1974, 1977). Analysing the pottery of both sites together, Garlake distinguished 10 vessel types, one of which was subdivided into 4 variants. Looking at the graphical representation of these types (Garlake, 1977, fig. 13) it is easy to see how well they compare with wares in current use, as Garlake himself emphas- izes, and in particular with those illustrated in Yoruba pottery. He points out</page><page sequence="9">320 P. ALLSWORTH-JONES a,-: FIG. 6 Aseye rockshelter, Iffe-Ijumu, reconstructed perforated pot (ajere) from excavations by Mrs. A.K. Fatunsin and Mr. J. Jemkur. that his type C is an isaasiin and his type B an agbada, whereas variant Al 'closely resembles Yoruba pitchers used for fetching and carrying water' (oru) and variants A3 and 4 'are closely similar to traditional jars for storing domestic water' (amzi) (fig. 5). 'There are no signs that fabric, firing and potting methods differ;' hence, Garlake concludes, 'there is a clear impression of continuity in the varieties of vessels, their shapes, some of the characteristic rim and lip forms, the mode of placement of the decoration, and the association of certain types of vessel and decoration with certain functions.' It would be hard to get a more comprehensive measure of similarity than this. Nor of course are indications of continuity confined in this case to ceramics. Thus, two iron artefacts from Obalara's Land are similar to 'ogboni' staves used by ' Ifa' diviners (Garlake, 1974, fig. 10); and ' ogboni' motifs can also be discerned on certain pottery vessels from this site (Garlake, 1974, fig. 6). In addition, there are a surprisingly large number of motifs at both sites which confirm the historical tradition of a link between Ife and Benin: leopards' heads, human heads with snakes issuing from the nostrils, 'cat's whiskers' and keloid scari- fications, and snakes. The potsherd pavements at both sites were frequently constructed around complete buried pots (interpreted by Garlake as libation jars) and semicircular cut-aways were convincingly shown to represent altars (Garlake, 1974, figs. 3 and 4, 1977, figs. 4-8). The rectangular panels behind the altars provide another link to Benin. While obviously the evidence from Old Oyo and Ile-Ife is of great impor- tance, there is no reason to think that the antiquity of Yoruba pottery is linked only to these two sites. Other areas may well have had a role to play, and mention should be made in particular of the so-called Niger-Benue confluence area to the north-east of Yorubaland. In this area, then part of Kwara now Kogi State, excavations have been conducted in the vicinity of Iffe-Ijumu by Professor Ade Obayemi, Mrs. A. K. Fatunsin and Mr. J. Jemkur, and jointly by this author and Philip Oyelaran (Obayemi, 1982; Oyelaran, Allsworth-</page><page sequence="10">CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN YORUBA POTTERY 321 Jones, and Stringer, 1986; Oyelaran, 1991; Allsworth-Jones and Oyelaran, 1991). Our excavations at the Itaakpa rock shelter in 1985 yielded human remains (the right half of a mandible and associated right maxilla as well as a number of teeth, probably all belonging to one adult male) at a level which has been dated by C14 at 260 + 80 B.C.. This level contained potsherds of a form and style which were made in the area until very recently, and they are also represented at other sites in the neighbourhood such as the Aseye and Oluwaju rockshelters, the second dated by C14 at A.D. 110 + 125 (fig. 6). Hence a case can be made for the continuous occupation of this area for a period exceeding 2000 years and for the existence here of Yoruba styles of pottery manufacture for the same period. This is not without relevance to the disputed question of the 'ancestral home' of the Yoruba people, in other words, the primacy or otherwise of Ile- Ife, an issue described by Robin Horton as 'sensitive, emotionally charged' and subject to 'extra-academic pressures and sanctions' (Horton, 1979; see also Obayemi, 1979). In his reassessment of the evidence concerning ancient Ife, Horton made the suggestion that the Niger-Benue confluence area consti- tuted a 'nucleus' from which 'proto-Yoruba speakers fanned out into the lands to the west and south-west' (including Ife) in the period from about 500 B.C. to A.D. 500 (Horton, 1979, fig. 1). All we can say at the moment is that the evidence we now have from Iffe-Ijumu is not inconsistent with this picture. Conclusion Yoruba pottery provides a general overview of the industry as it exists in south-western Nigeria today (particularly in relation to the techniques employed and the types of vessels produced, especially those used for ritual purposes) and of the beliefs and ways of life of its practitioners. The book does not claim to be exhaustive, and it is to be hoped that it will provide the stimulus for further detailed studies, including studies of individual potting centres, not all of which, inevitably, could be included in this book (cf. Aiyedun, 1988). Apart from a scientific study of the various raw materials employed and a more thoroughgoing examination of regional stylistic distinctions, other subjects for more specialized examination might include the way in which pottery is currently marketed, its connections to the other traditional industries with which its fate seems to a large extent to be bound up, the lineages and quarters which specialize in pottery within the various centres, and the works and beliefs of individual potters. In view of the rapidity with which changes are affecting all aspects of Nigerian life, there is a need for such studies to be undertaken soon. In view of what has been said above, the utility of contemporary studies of Yoruba pottery for deciphering the archaeological record should be clear. A recognizably Yoruba pottery tradition can, it is claimed, be traced back for at least 1000 years and perhaps for more than 2000. The extent to which such approaches to the African past can be justified was the subject of lively discussion at the 1994 conference on 'The growth of farming communities in Africa from the Equator southwards' sponsored by the British Institute in Eastern Africa and the African Studies Centre, Cambridge. In their paper Huffman and Herbert claimed that 'a vital relationship' exists between 'worldview, material culture and language' and that 'ceramic style' is the 'principal artefact category used to recognize and trace groups of people in the archaeological record'. In effect that approach has been adopted here, as it has been by Willett, Garlake, and others who have studied the remains of the past unearthed at historic Yoruba centres.

That does not mean we should stop digging, and we should certainly record all aspects of the work of these humourous, modest, hard-working, and skilful women before it is too late.
