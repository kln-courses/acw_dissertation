Pintar and Narayan Yoganandan Dept. of Neurosurgeiy Medical College of Wisconsin Veterans Administration Medical Center Anthony Sanees, Jr. Dept. of Neurosurgeiy Medical College of Wisconsin Veterans Administration Medical Center Marquette Univ. John Reinartz Dept. of Neurosurgeiy Medical College of Wisconsin Veterans Administration Medical Center Gerald Harris Dept. of Biomedical Engineering Marquette Univ. Sanford J. Larson Dept. of Neurosurgery Medical College of Wisconsin Veterans Administration Medical Center ABSTRACT The patho-anatomic alterations due to vertical loading of the human cervical column were documented and correlated with biomechanical kinematic data. Seven fresh human cadaveric head-neck complexes were prepared, and six-axis load cells were placed at the proximal and distal ends of the specimens to document the gross biomechanical response. Retroreflective markers were placed on bony landmarks of vertebral bodies, articular facets, and spinous processes along the entire cervical column. Targets were also placed on the occiput and arch of C1 . The localized movements of these markers were recorded using a video analyzer during the entire loading cycle. Pre-test two-dimensional, and three-dimensional computerized tomography (CT), and plane radiographs were taken. The specimens were loaded to failure using an electrohydraulic testing device at a rate of 2 mm/s. Preparations were deep frozen in the compressed state using dry ice and liquid nitrogen to preserve the deformations of the tissues as well as bony alterations. Two-dimensional ČT's were done and sequential anatomic sections were taken using a cryomicrotome. These image data documented the soft and hard tissue strains. Biomechanical data (strength and localized kinematics) together with the image data correlated well with the pathology. Upper cervical injuries were observed under compression-extension modes while lower cervical injuries occurred under compression-flexion modes. Because the specimens were analyzed at failure, preserving tissue alterations, the pathology observed in the present study may provide an insight into the behavior of the cervical spine at the level of injury. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES INVOLVING motor vehicle accidents indicate that cervical injuries occur more often than injuries to other portions of the spinal column (35).* Furthermore, the majority of both complete and incomplete quadriplegic injuries were produced by flexion-compression loading with disruption of the 'Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. vertebral bodies (35). The majority of previous studies in the cervical region has been directed to investigations of elements less than the total cervical column (2- 4,12,13,16-19,22-27,29-31,34). More recently, studies have been conducted to determine mechanisms of injury to the total cervical column (1,5,6,9- 11,14,15,25,32,33). The anatomical complexity of the cervical column permits motion in flexion, extension, rotation, and bending because of its material properties and architecture. Furthermore, pure motion in any direction is rarely encountered in the cervical column because of its articulation and change in the orientation of the facet joints. Therefore, the motions of the cervical column are coupled (7,8). While previous studies with segments of the cervical column are helpful, more recently, systems have become available to allow quantification of the movements of various components of the entire cervical spine with loading (28). Because of the interest in the development of an improved anthropomorphic manikin head-neck system, a detailed analysis of the alterations of cervical column under compressive loading was undertaken in this study. Furthermore, the majority of our scientific knowledge regarding injury mechanisms of the total cervical column has been obtained from retrospective clinical or biomechanical studies designed to examine the tissues following load relaxation. This study, therefore, was conducted to examine the anatomical alterations of bony and soft tissues under failure loads. The corresponding movements of the bony elements at each level were recorded as a function of applied load, and the pre- and post-bony architecture was determined with conventional x-rays, two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) computerized tomography (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven fresh human cadavers were used. Table 1 includes details of the specimens used in the study. The specimens were evaluated radiographically and from their medical histories to preclude metastatic disease. The head and spine were isolated to avoid damage to the ligaments and other soft tissues. The head and neck was separated at the T2-T3 junction. Preparations were deep frozen at -40° Centigrade prior to testing. The specimens were radio- 1766</page><page sequence="2">graphed in the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral planes, and 2-D CT was done with the General Electric 9800 Scanner at overlapping 1.5 mm sections in the axial and sagittal planes. Three-dimensional CT reconstructions were obtained using the work station (Dimensional Medicine Inc., Minnetonka, MN).

The specimens were mounted in a specially designed test apparatus (Figure 1). The distal end of the specimen was rigidly mounted in a 75 mm diameter steel cylinder, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was used for fixation. The cap of the head was removed with a bone saw through the frontal, temporal and occipital bones about 50 mm superior to the Frankfort plane. A 25 mm diameter aluminum rod with a 50 mm diameter spherical end was rigidly fixed in the skull with PMMA. The spherical end of the rod which protruded out of the skull was used for positioning and mounting in a custom designed socket. This socket was fixed to a six-axis Denton load cell (Denton, Rochester, NY). The load cell was fixed to a specially designed electrohydraulic Material Testing System (MTS, Minneapolis, MN) capable of applying 10,000 N of force at speeds up to 7.5 m/s. The distal end of the specimen was rigidly attached to a second identical six-axis load cell mounted on an x-y cross table. The orientation of the load cell was such that the z direction was superior-inferior and the x direction was AP, and the left to right or lateral measurements were in the y direction. The cervical spine was aligned to remove the lordosis of the column. This was achieved by preflexing the column approximately 10° to 20° prior to loading. The tissues were prepared with retroreflective spherical pin targets 2 to 3 mm in diameter (Figure 2). These targets were securely inserted into the bony regions; at least two targets in each vertebral body, (sometimes four) one target in each facet column, and one target in the posterior aspect of the spinous process. Targets were also placed at the occiput, and the C1 arch. A total of 20 to 40 targets were used to obtain localized kinematic information of the various spinal elements along the entire cervical column during loading. Localized kinematic data was obtained with RS170 video signals and analyzed by a motion analyzer, (Motion Analysis System, CA) which allowed 2-D planar analysis in the AP (x) and the superior-inferior (z) directions. The precision/ reproducibility for 150 to 200 mm square field of view typical in the present study exceeds .08 mm and the system accuracy exceeds 0.1 mm (28). The head-neck specimen was compressed at a quasi- static rate of 2 mm/s until a noticeable failure occurred. Failure was defined as a significant dip in the force time trace with a concomitant fracture. The deformation was maintained at this level, and a lateral x-ray was taken. A &lt;*««* load ciU + *ij¡^ Figure 1: Schematic diagram illustrating the test preparation with six-axis load cells above and below the head-neck complex. Note the vertical orientation of the cervical spine. styrofoam frame was constructed around the preparation to freeze the specimen in its compressed state. For this purpose dry ice and liquid nitrogen was poured around the specimen. Following this, 2-D and 3-D ČT's were obtained. The entire cervical column was then sectioned with a heavy-duty cryomicrotome LKB (Broma, Sweden) capable of intervals down to 1 p,m (21). Colored photographs of the tissue were taken after every 1 mm of tissue removal to determine the anatomical alterations of the soft and hard tissues. Fourteen channels of biomechanical data were collected from the two six-axis load cells placed at the proximal and distal ends of the specimen, and from the load washer of the MTS device (Kistler Corp., Model 9352A). The axial compressive displacements were obtained from the built-in linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) attached in series with the piston. A modular data acquisition system (TransEra Corp. Provo, Utah, Model 7000) was used to gather the data as a function of time. A four-channel digital oscilloscope (Norland Corp., Madison, Wl, Model 3001) provided a back up system. The generalized force histories (Fx, Fy, Fz), and moments (Mx, My, Mz) along with the localized two-dimensional kinematic data of the individual retroreflective targets were obtained. The pathoanatomical images were correlated to the biomechanical findings. Furthermore, the applied compressive force vs displacement response of the structure was obtained from the MTS piston records. 1767</page><page sequence="3">' oc ' # C3 ^ "^V. 04 mr^i # 05 • * ^' 06 • * Figure 2: Lateral schematic view of the cervical column showing the placement of retroreflective targets. A maximum of six targets were used at each vertebral level of the column. Targets were rigidly fixed to the bony landmarks of the vertebrae. RESULTS Table 2 includes a summary of the biomechanical data and pathologic findings on each specimen. The specimens were subjected to compressive forces ranging from 1355 to 3613 N with corresponding displacements ranging from 9 to 37 mm. The axial compression force vs displacement response of all the specimens are indicated in Figure 3 . The peak represented by the point A in this figure is indicative of fracture and/or subluxation at any particular level in the preparation. For ex: In Figure 3 (for specimen #206), the decrease in loading occurring at the point A was associated with a posterior subluxation of C2 on C3 vertebra. Figure 4 (a-g) illustrates the generalized force history data from all the specimens. The data includes the information from the proximal and distal load cells. As can be seen, there is a force balance in the three cartesian directions between the two sets of data. The maximum compressive forces recorded by the uni-axial load cell from the MTS piston was within ± 5% of the maximum compressive force (Fz) recorded by the load cell at the proximal end of the specimen (Figures »3, 4). In addition, the forces in the lateral-lateral (right to left or left to right) direction, Fy, were substantially smaller than the, AP and superior-inferior forces (Fx and Fz). The Fx shear forces were greater than the Fy forces but less than the compressive forces (Fz). The transverse moment (axial, Mz) were essentially insignificant compared to the flexion-extension moment (Sagital, My). Moments in the coronal plane (Mx) were also smaller than My. Therefore, with the axial compressive loading flexion or extension moments, often with shear, were induced on the column. Table 3 (a-g) includes a summary of the kinematic data from all the specimens used in the study. The data indicates the compressions/distractions of the anterior and/or posterior vertebral body's discs and spinous processes at each level of the column. This data was generated by calculating the absolute distance between two adjacent retroreflective targets on every frame of the video image, and then recording the maximum change over the time sequence. For example, in specimen #206, the distraction of the C3-C4 disc (3.4 mm) shown in Table 3 (f) was obtained as the maximum change in distance (in this case elongation) between the C3 anterior-inferior target and the C4 anterior-superior target. In general, these kinematic data correlate well with the pathology (for ex: anterior longitudinal ligament tear is associated with distortion in the disc at that level). A superposition of the pre-test and the post-test (with the specimen sustaining the maximum force) lateral projection obtained from radiographs is given in Figures 5a-5f. The occiput is compressed vertically in the superior-inferior direction by the piston of the testing device. The bottom vertebrae (T1 or T2) is rigidly fixed in PMMA. These diagrams correlate with the kinematic data and the pathlogy observed from the test. Figure 6 (a- b) illustrates the movements of the targets (in specimen 205 and 206) placed on the bony regions of the preparations. The right side of the figure corresponds to the targets placed in the vertebral bodies and the left side of the figure corresponds to those placed in the spinous processes. The middle trajectories are associated with the targets placed in the region of the facet. The closed circles indicate the initial points and the open circles the final point of each trajectory. The trajectories not terminated by an open circle are indicative of targets masked at sometime during the compression and, therefore, incomplete kinematic data was obtained. The trajectory information essentially demonstrates movements of the targets at each spinal level. The occiput compresses the preparation essentially vertically with some anterior motion secondary to the flexion-extension moment produced at the superior aspect of the preparation. The pathology observed from the CT and cryomicrotome sections are illustrated in Figures 7 (a-f). From these biomechanical data and pathological observations (Table 2), the mechanism of injury was axial compression in one (#203), compression-flexion in two (#201 and #205), and compression-extension in the remaining four specimens. All of the specimens experienced A-P shear forces, however, the lateral bending moments and lateral shear forces were small. DISCUSSION In this study, biomechanical strength, kinematic, and patho-anatomic (2-D CT, 3-D CT, and cryomicrotome) information were obtained from tests conducted on seven fresh human cadaveric head-neck 1768</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 2: Summary of Results FZ A Test # (N) (mm) pathologic findings MECHANISM QF INJURY 3-D CT 2-D CT Cryptome 20 1 13 55 9 Same C2 Chip fx Same COMPRESSION-FLEXION Same Flexion skull relative to C1 and C2 Same alar ligament disrupted Fx facet of C1 Same Di^ruptipn of çapsule Ç1-Ç2 202 2232 30 Same C2.C3 vert body fx Same COMPRESSION-EXTENSION Same 40% 01 ant comp fx Same Same C2 on C3, C3 on C4 posterior disc Same location, facet fxs, and posterior complex disruption Posterior ligaments disrupted upper cervicai soine 20 3 lZJLâ 22 Same Tvoe III odontiod fx SâffiS AĶļAĻ ÇQMPRES$1QN 204 2286 26 Sublux facet C3 vertebral body displaced into Same COMPRESSION-EXTENSION at C3-C4 canal; ant. long, lig and disc rupture at C3-C4; joint capsule disruption C3-C4 facet; C3 spinous process fx 20 5 3613 14 Minimal changes Lig flavum tears at C6-C7, C7-T1 Same COMPRESSION-FLEXION 2mm anterior sublux Same C5 body pp Ç6 206 2273 37 Same Chip fx of ant inf body of C2 Same COMPRESSION-EXTENSION Same Complete posterior dislocation of Same C2 on C3, cord compromise Interspinous lig disruption at C7-T1 with fanning Sáme Mild comp fx C7 Same 207 2597 34 Same Chip fx of ant inf body of C2 Same COMPRESSION-EXTENSION Same Complete posterior dislocation of C2 on C3, cord compromise Same Complete ant dislocation of C5 on Same C6 with cord compromise Same Compression fx of C7 Same Note: Fz: SI load at failure A: Deformation of the actuator at failure load Myt: Flexion-extension moment from the top load cell Myb: Flexion-extension moment from the bottom load cell For Myt and Myb (+) values indicate flexion moments and (-) values indicate extension moments complexes. Although many studies have been published in the literature on the biomechanical properties of the cadaveric human cervical spine, most of these focus on the physiologic motion at low level forces and on portions extracted from the neck, i.e., isolated functional units or segmental preparations (2-4,1 2,13,16-1 9,22,23,29- 31,34). The failure strength and localized kinematic data were rarely reported. Because of the architecture and integrity of the human neck, it is essential to understand the behavior of the structure in its entire anatomical configuration. Investigations have been conducted on the excised entire cadaveric cervical column (1,5,6,24-26). McElhaney et al studied the lateral and AP passive (without musculature) bending response of isolated ligamentous columns (9-11). Bending stiffness was measured using a five-axis load cell placed at the distal end of the specimen. Axial forces (Fz) ranging from 108 to 2305 N with flexion-extension moments (My) ranging from 3.01 to 14.6 N.m produced wedged vertebral bodies and anterior or posterior ligament tears. In contrast, in another study, under compressive loading, with forces ranging from 960 to 5470 N McElhaney, et al reported fractured vertebral bodies in cervical column preparations (base of skull to C5, C6, C7 or T1) tested at velocities of 50 to 92 cm/s. Hodgson and Thomas tested human cadavers with superior-inferior loading (5,6). In some cadavers, strain gauges were placed on the cervical vertebral bodies and articular facets. Soft tissues were removed from one side of the neck to examine the cervical spine kinematics. A stiffness of 1670 N/cm (maximum force = 1420 N, deflection = 12 mm) was reported under the axial compressive mode for a subject which underwent loading through a fixed swivel. This technique restrained atlanto- occipital movement. Lower cervical damage was observed. For anterior loading on the initially straight spine in which head rotation was permitted, an average stiffness of 1580 N/cm (force = 1420 N, deflection = 9 mm) was reported. Stretching of the posterior longitudinal ligament and interspinous ligaments were observed in these preparations. Tests have also been conducted on intact human cadavers (14,15,24-26,32,33). Nusholtz et al studied the response to superior-inferior head impact using 12 fresh intact specimens. The impact tests were conducted with a free-falling moment-matched pendulum which struck a 56 kg impactor at velocities ranging from 4.6 to 5.6 m/s. The specimens were suitably oriented to study the effect of spinal configuration on the pathology induced due to impact. Seven out of 12 tests produced compression-extension injuries. One specimen did not have any injury. Of the remaining four specimens which resulted in a compression-flexion type injury, only one specimen demonstrated cervical vertebral body fracture. 1769</page><page sequence="5">„00 t 20! ^ 202 ^ î00 203 Ä7] ^ ý' ^ / r A~' A / '50°" / r 2000 -■ /YV A / K f w / V J / * " 750 / if /x/ © ,000-- / " / ° f if / o / / u. / f of / u_ / A 1000 - / ļ f / 500 - - / o -M- 1 o -r- 1 1 1 1 » o Y- - • 1 • 1 . o 5 10 0 20 40 60 0 10 20 30 Deformation (mm) Deformation (mm) Deformation (mm) 3000 4000 -, 205 3000 2 0 6 Ā 3000 ] A A /I ✓-N j' 2000 / E ✓-N / % % /V w ® " 1500 - / © 2000 - / © „ y " y u &lt;r ° ,° / o / o / y Li- y / u. o / / f ( 1000 -- f o V- ' 1 1 1 1 o -F- » o 1 ' , 1 0 10 20 30 0 20 0 20 40 60 Deformation (mm) Deformation (mm) Deformation (mm) 207 &lt;000 - - ą / Figure 3: Axial force-displacement response of all the g- / seven specimens used In the study.

Impact forces ranged from 6000 to 11100 N. A force of 6000 N on the head produced vertebral body fractures at C5 and C6 in one specimen. Although higher impact forces at the head were recorded in the other three specimens, no cervical vertebral damage was present. This was, in part, due to the orientation of the specimen. A force of 11100 N did not result in bony trauma to the cervical spine in another specimen. In these experiments, the head angles ranged from 10° to 30°, neck angles from 5° to 25°. In contrast, in the present study, all the cervical columns were preflexed at approximately 10° to 20°. In another study, Alem et al subjected 19 fresh human cadavers to superior-inferior impacts at velocities ranging from 6.9 to 10.9 .m/s using a 10 kg force-flying mass (1). Impact forces ranged from 3000 N to 17000 N with peak accelerations varying from 45 'to 160 G's. The study concluded that the peak impact force could not be used as a reliable predictor for cervical spine injury. In these studies using isolated cervical columns or intact human cadavers, the localized kinematic data and the detailed pathology at the point of failure were not obtained. However, the failure loads and deformation from the isolated cervical columns obtained in the present study compare favorably with the above cited isolated column studies (Table 4). Recent studies on isolated ligaments of cadaveric cervical spines, have shown that the tensile failure load, stiffness and energy absorbing capacity increase with increasing loading rates (34). Recently, Yoganandan et al conducted a study to evaluate the mechanism of spinal injuries with vertical impact (32). Sixteen fresh intact human male cadavers were suspended head down and dropped vertically from a height of 0.9 to 1.5 m. In eight out of the sixteen specimens, the head were restrained to simulate the effect of muscle tone.

The anterior inferior aspect of C2 has a chip fracture seen on CT and cryotome images (arrow). The anterior region of the foramen magnum contacted the anterior tip of C2 with disruption of the alar ligament (arrow). There was also a disruption of the facet capsule at the C1-2 level, observable on the 3-D CT. This spine was injured in compression-flexion. 1784</page><page sequence="20">Figure 7b: Sagittal 2-D CT (left top) and the corresponding cryomicrotome image (right top) of specimen #202.

Notice the posterior longitudinal ligament tear at the C3-4 level, posterior dislocation of C2 and C3 on C4, and posterior ligament complex disruptions at the upper cervical region (on the cryomicrotome image). The mechanism of injury is compression-extension at the upper cervical level with the spinal cord compromised at this level. In the lower cervical spine, a wedge compression fracture (approximately 40%) is observed due to compression flexion.

Head impact forces ranged from 3000 N to 7100 N in the unrestrained and from 9800 N to 14700 N in the restrained specimens. There were more upper thoracic and cervical fractures in the restrained compared to the unrestrained case. Sixteen mm high-speed films taken at 1000 frames/s revealed that upper thoracic fractures occurred primarily due to the bending of the thoracic spine. Cervical vertebral body damage was observed most commonly when the cadavers remained in contact with the impacting surface without substantial rotation or rebound. In this study, although patho- anatomic correlations were obtained from CT and cryotome, the specimens were not frozen in situ at the point of failure. This study emphasizes the soft and hard tissue alterations of the cervical spine at injury producing force levels. Because of preservation of the tissue alterations at failure, the patho-anatomic images reveal the non-relaxed injury state of the structure. Therefore, in field accident conditions, one would anticipate a different configuration and pathology for the cervical spine following trauma. Preliminary studies conducted in our laboratory have indicated that, the spine configuration secondary to axial loading are substantially different when relaxed in contrast to those shown in the present study. Consequently, retrospective studies which are used to determine the mechanisms of injury may not predict the exact position of the cervical column and its elements with respect to the spinal cord. It appears that substantial alterations and movements of the elements of the cervical column occur, and cannot be recorded in the absence of detailed analyses similar to those used in this study. These studies indicate that substantial soft-tissue damage can occur with typical axial loading techniques which might not be evaluated with standard clinical methods. If predictable spinal alterations can be obtained using the methods of the present study, an improved extrapolation regarding cervical injuries is possible. Also, the deformations and alterations of the spinal column which occur can be used to advance an improved design for an anthropomorphic manikin.
