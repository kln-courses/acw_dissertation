<plain_text><page sequence="1">Would You Rather Be a Cyborg or a Goddess? On Being a Teacher in a Postmodern Century By Suzanne K. Damarin The rampant growth of postmodern information and communications technologies throughout society and the increasing pressure to incorporate these technologies into education create new and uncomfortable situations for feminist educators. The patriarchal roots of these tech- nologies, together with a multiplicity of traditions, beliefs, issues, and practices which have separated women from technology leave us with little in the way of direction or insight as to appropriate feminist responses to the demands of these pervasive technologies. It is urgent that we find new and creative modes of being and acting in this "high- tech" world. Cultural theorist Donna Haraway recognizes the powers of technologies as they operate on the society at large and on individuals. In much of her writing she challenges feminists and other radicals to create new ways of being in postmodern society and new relationships with postmodern technologies. Her cyborg figure, first described in 1985 to stimulate socialist feminists to rethink feminist politics, embodies this potential.1 As described in "Manifesto," the cyborg is a subject in search of radical strategies of survival in the face of multiple impositions of command, control, communication, and informatics. To survive, the cyborg must find new feminist consciousness and political savvy. Having described the exigencies of cyborg life in some detail, Haraway ends her paper with the provocative state- ment "though both are caught in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess." The dilemma, to be a goddess or a cyborg, seems to me to be a central issue for teachers as they dance a spiral inscribed by politics, science, and the lives of children as they emerge in this time and space of postmodern technologies. In this article, therefore, I elaborate (and celebrate) the goddess and cyborg mythologies in contexts of teaching. The cyborg versus goddess dichotomy is not unrelated to other lopsided binary choices we make. (Do you teach subject matter content? Or, do you teach "the whole child" ?) The spiral dance of education can be viewed as movement among the various positions offered in the evolving economies of hyperspace, virtual reality, and post-Fordist capitalism. A spiral, however, requires three dimensions in order to exist and be danced; it cannot be reduced to binary questions of goddess versus cyborg or to any other dichotomy. Therefore, like Haraway in all of her writing, like goddess and other religious myths with their trinities, and like the deconstructive move in postmodern philosophy, the spiral dance invites and requires the search This article was originally presented as part of a Symposium on Cyborgs in Education at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association in New Orleans, April 3, 1994. I am grateful to Marilyn Hegarty for conversations about some of the ideas in this article. for a "third term," positionalities for teachers who are neither goddess nor cyborg but always already both goddess and cyborg. The mythology of the Goddess: Legends of teaching Goddess myths have existed in many cultures; the stories and powers of the goddess are recorded in texts and artifacts ranging from earthen vessels used to transport the water which sustains earthly life to tombs which signify transport from one life to another. David Kinsley, in his study of the goddess as she is represented in the literatures and artifacts of both eastern and western cultures, describes her universal attributes and responsibilities. The goddess, although undoubtedly possessing a variety of func- tions and characteristics insofar as she reigned for so long and over such a large area, was primarily the mother of all life Images of the goddess, preg- nant, giving birth, or holding infants are not uncom- mon. But she was not just the mother of human beings, she was the mother of all, the spirit that imbued all creation with life and vitality. She was not, in any important way, a warrior goddess, although she was associated with death. Her association with death . . . suggests her second major aspect, "the Taker of All," a form in which she was responsible for transformation, metamorphosis, regeneration, re- birth, and so on. (xiv) Responsible for the nurturance of life and vitality, for transformation and metamorphosis, she was/is surely at least partly a teacher. It is teachers who are charged with the transformation of humans from childhood play and innocence through adolescent self-construction to burgeon- ing adulthood. The discourses of the goddess as nurturing and mater- nal, the idea of "Goddesses in Every Woman" (Bolen), and Catharine Beecher's construction of teaching as "woman's true profession" come together in the discourse of the teaching profession as the continuation of mothering and the nurturance of the individual child. If this discourse is sometimes muted by the cacophony of political demands for accountability, computerization, and professionalization, it is not obliterated but continues to flourish within the context of teachers' lives and desires. The emergence, within the past decade, of an extensive discourse of caring as the guiding ethic of teachers (Nod- dings) appears to be an effort to re-reify the goddess within the teaching profession. Grounded in examples of maternal 54 Feminist Teacher Vol. 8, No. 2 ♦ 54-60</page><page sequence="2">Photo by Janet Woodcock, courtesy of Wheaton College. nurturance and godly theories of Buber and other the- ologians, the discourses of the one-caring, the cared for, and the maintenance of the caring relation have no truck with postmodern technologies, information explosions, or cyborgian enigmas of identity and subjectivity. The "one- caring," the teacher attentive to the "cared for," is the "taker of all" . . . accepting of the whims and foibles of students, yet responsible for their metamorphosis, their shedding of childish attitudes and ignorance as they adopt new forms of adolescence and adulthood. Reading the goddess as metaphor for teacher, the teacher is inscribed by goddess myths, myths which prevail in both prescriptive and dialectic forms. In the codified rules for teachers a century and more ago, and in the media portrayal of teachers, we find reflections of the mythology of the goddess as generous of her love and nurturance, responsible to her roots, and eschewing of sexuality. In love, the goddess/teacher is agape, not eros. Writing of the teacher as she appears in the texts of novels, films, and TV, media theorist George Gerbner writes: "Typical is Miss Dove, who is so devoted, so selfless, so excruciatingly good" . . . she passes up the opportunity to marry (78). Retired schoolteachers interviewed by Green and Manke express similar themes of selfless devotion intrinsically rewarded when they see "with their own eyes" that students are indeed transformed, metamorphosized, regenerated, and reborn. Preservice teachers are drawn to the profession by the allure of this mythology. Indeed, like members of religious orders, many feel that teaching is a calling. It is not uncommon for future teachers to have felt the call while in the early grades and to have begun teacherly activities by playing school. For those who receive it, it is a call to responsibility for nurturance and transformation of stu- dents; in the words of one preservice teacher: I want to be able to shape children's lives giving them hope for the future and instilling a sense of con- fidence in each one. Teachers may be the hope for changing our society for the better. Like (some of) the media teachers described by Gerbner and others, these former and future teachers eschew worldly satisfactions and spend their most critical remarks on others in the profession who seek such extrinsic rewards. Summarizing their interviews with retired teachers, Green and Manke observe "one of the worst things these teachers could say about a teacher was 'she's in it for the money'" (107). Thus, even as these teachers speak a discourse of teacher as goddesslike paragon of devotion and commit- ment, they also reveal a counter-discourse of (some/other) teachers' materialism. Discourses notwithstanding, in a very real sense teachers are not goddesses, but earthly creatures who must negotiate their sustenance and positionalities in the material world. Cyborg or Goddess ♦ 55</page><page sequence="3">Contradictory discourses emerge at the interstices of myth and reality. Green and Manke's retired teachers, for exam- ple, speak not only of the moral failings of teachers who "are in it for the money," but also of the insufficiency of the monetary remuneration for themselves. Generally speak- ing, teachers "conceive of money as tainted" (Joseph and Burnaford 11); yet they invoke future financial success as motivation for the students whom they teach. As Joseph and Burnaford observe, in this and other regards, "teachers' moral callings reflect their own values but not the values or aspirations of those whom they teach" (11). Conflicts between goddess-inspired images of teachers and the realities of the classroom emerge in other domains as well. On the one hand, teachers see themselves as leaders and as powerful; but in practice, they are seen (and often see themselves) as obedient and conformist (Joseph and Burnaford) and as "pawns in a game ... we don't even know that is being played" (qtd. in Efron and Joseph 72). Media portrayals of teachers reflect and extend this ambivalence; not every media teacher is the good Miss Dove mentioned above. Indeed, negative images of teachers predominate over positive ones in film and televised por- trayals. These images range from buffoon to tyrant to witch. Although the frequency of male teachers is much greater among the media teachers than among professional teachers, female teachers are especially subject to TV and movie ridicule, a pattern which has remained constant for two decades (Joseph and Burnaford; Gerbner). According to Gerbner, teachers are "outstanding among all TV occupa- tions in being the 'cleanest' and the 'kindest.' But they were also rated the 'weakest,' the 'softest' and the 'slowest'" (83). If media teachers are most often men, they are men with characteristics most often associated with "the good" as perceived in (i.e., written into) the "feminine." Gerbner offers the following observation: Giving teachers a messianic mission and having schools soak up all the dreams and aspirations cit- izens have for their children dooms the enterprise to failure. No social order can afford to make good on such a promise. The illusion itself contains the seeds of the noble-but-impractical image. It becomes only reasonable and realistic to show teachers full of goodness, but sapped of vitality and power. Turn on the power and the impotent figure becomes a mon- ster, only confirming the doubts and suspicions inher- ent in the ambivalent image. (91) The power of the goddess as described by Kinsley is feminine power realized and practiced through birthing, nurturance, and transformation. Classroom teachers accept the calling to this goddess power. In the media teacher, however, this power is stripped away in patriarchal skits and texts. The power "turned on" in Gerbner's analysis is a more patriarchal version. As when the electricity of light- ning strikes an electrical transformer, there is danger, darkness, and confusion. . .the breeding ground for mon- sters. Through the media of modern and postmodern technologies, the goddess emerges de-deified and one of many monsters, a figure adopted by Haraway (1992) in her discussions of the "inappropriate/d others." (In)appropriation of teachers: The high-tech version In recent years some feminists have sought in the literatures of goddess worship a history of matriarchal societies, and in the re-turn to goddess mythologies, a move toward if not a female-dominated society, at least one which is more hospitable to women and the valuing of them. Kinsley's analyses do not encourage this move, however; he observes that goddess worship prevailed in some patriarchal societies, even in some misogynist societies. He warns his readers to be wary of those accounts in which goddesses are portrayed as subservient to men. In this time of large scale educational adoption of computers, arguably the surrogates of men (and of hypercapitalist men, at that), Kinsley's warning is one that teachers (and teacher educators) must heed. Literatures of re-inscription of the goddess/teacher within the evolving economies of distance education, com- puter-based learning, multimedia-based instruction, and teaching students to navigate the information superhighway, assign to her those (sub)service tasks required to establish and continue the hegemony of man-machines in the re- definition of education: facilitation, trouble-shooting, and monitoring. Recognizing Kinsley's warnings and these developments, teachers might join Haraway in electing to choose as "role model" some figure other than the goddess, but teacher education provides slim pickings in this regard. There is a sense, of course, in which postmodern teachers can no more elect not to be cyborgs, than they can elect to be goddesses. This modern realist issue is not what concerns me here; instead, my concern is with the possibilities of cyborgian myths and legends as metaphors or simulacra through which we might build a new construction of teaching and teachers in postmodern times. To my knowl- edge, the concept of cyborg is not yet represented in teacher education, nor in the discourses of teachers, though some educators have begun to look at the ways in which cyborgs are constructed within educational domains. Insofar as teachers must by cyborgs, then what kind of cyborgs should they/we be? The educational literatures which address the relations between and among teachers, students, and machines are dominated by the technocentric narratives and exhortations of educational technology; patriarchal institutions of the BUGOMIS (BUsiness, Government, Military, Science) feed and are fed by these literatures. Voices of dissent can be found in a relatively small number of works by Bowers, Noble, and others who reveal the roots of educational technology, its past and current failures, and its threats to current concepts and practices of education. Beyond these dedicated praises and critiques, the literatures of teaching and teacher education seem to be silent with respect to information technologies; new works and theories on teacher ethics, image, and practice emerge regularly with nary a mention of technology in the classroom - or, for that matter, outside it. By refusing to recognize technology, these literatures seek to deny its effects. Strategies of denial can be powerful moves on the part of hegemonic leaders (as any marginalized person can attest), for they render politi- cally invisible that which is being denied. But silence in the face of huge investments by the BUGOMIS, not only of 56 ♦ S.K. Damarin</page><page sequence="4">dollars but of "political capital" as well, is arguably dysfunctional behavior - a strategy of hiding in cyberspace and hoping the monster will go away. Silence is not effective as counter-hegemonic politics. (Parenthetically, I wonder: How many of these texts of denial have been written on wordprocessors? How many have been desktop published? How many use data organized and analyzed through SAS or SPSS? How many postmodern qualitative researchers have eased their scholarly burdens by using Ethnograph? Of these, how many recognize the computer as a presence in the classroom described?. . .And, were your data "scanned in" to an electronic data base? Did you use a library search system? Computer graphics? The Internet? to write/research/submit/ present your AERA paper? Did you teleconference with your co-symposiasts? Fax your abstract to the panel of referees? Are you a cyborgian educational researcher?) Oppositional educational writers, and some educational technologists (e.g., Knupfer), recognize that what we are dealing with is the imposition of change by well-financed and politically powerful elites. But this is not the only story. We also elect and enjoy the "bennies" of the technologies imposed, the benefits we call savings of time, increased productivity, control of our own manuscripts, and so on, as well as the Benzedrine "down" from the political cacoph- ony of faculty lives to solitary communion with computer screens. Everywhere, people are opting in, even as they are opting out; opting in and opting out become indistinguish- able. Are we being co-opted, corrupted, colonized? Would you give up your laptop? It's interesting you might think I mean a computer, and not that comfy place where a child might seek a teacher's love. The mythical cyborg of Haraway denies the denial of technology in the world and invites all of us to seek new metaphorical resources and a poly vocal, multi-cited poli- tics of survival in the face of command-control-communica- tion-intelligence, the C3I of the power orgy which fathered and fathers postmodern technologies. The mythology of the cyborg: New roles/rules for teaching Haraway 's Manifesto for Cyborgs "is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for respon- sibility in their construction" (150). Like the goddess, the cyborg is a mythological creature; as described by Haraway, The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, Utopian, and completely without innocence. No longer structured by the polarity of public and pri- vate, the cyborg defines a technological polis based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. . . . The main trouble with cyborgs, of course is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate off- spring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential. (151) In Haraway 's version/ vision, the cyborg has sprung the lock of its subservience to military masters and roams at will the networks constructed for patriarchal control. No longer constrained by these constraints, she seeks out spots in which there is a residue of vulnerability, an interstice, to use Foucauldian terminology, in which knowledge might accrue and power might be constructed. Analogous to the aquatic animal, itself part water and swimming in a sea made, not only of water, but of micro- and other organisms, the cyborg - part nature/part machine - is not essentially dif- ferent from her environment - part nature/part machine. The cyborg is not in any necessary way a robot, a mechanical pseudo-man which follows the directions of a pre-inscribed program with faithfulness to its father. In- stead, the cyborg seeks sites for resistance to the naturaliz- ing of machines and the mechanization of culture. Cyborgian teachers roam among us today; they are cousins of computer hackers and of data entry operators who hack strategies to obstruct the counting of key presses and other intrusions of the computerized panopticon work- place. Cyborgian teachers accept computers into their classrooms only to diver the effects of C3I. Like the teachers described by Olson, they subvert the intentions of machine donors and use computers to reproduce and magnify their own personalities. Some, like these described by Apple and Jungck, deny, through their (in)actions, the importance of the machine to themselves and to their students. Because they need not be faithful to their human or machine-theoretic roots, cyborgian teachers take pleasure in ironies and reversals unthinkable by their pre-cyborgian mentors. They mess with the machines to create ficts and factions from socially constructed facts and fictions. Like Teachers might join Haraway in electing to choose as "role model" some figure other than the goddess, but teacher éducation provides slim pickings in this regard. Cyborg or Goddess ♦ 57</page><page sequence="5">the Barbie Liberation Front, they switch the tapes in Barbie and G.I. Joe. . .and they bring the dolls to school and see what the kids make of a Teen Talk Barbie talking gruff and tough and a G.I. Joe that squeals about wanting to dance and math being hard. Cyborgian teachers play with the anthropomorphism of machines . . . their students unpack the grammar and mean- ings of adjectives and nouns: computer anxiety and com- puter capability', they diagram the visual grammar of screen displays and write poems about the machine anxiety over humans. Metaphor and metonymy are the methods of their daily lesson plans. If, as Andrew Ross claims, the language and discourse concerning computer viruses is derived from the discourses of sex and AIDS, the cyborgian teacher reverses it back; in the teaching of the cyborg, the manda- tory computer lessons on preventing computer viruses become an advance organizer for a new and subversive curriculum of sex and AIDS education. The cyborgian teacher may be unfaithful to the fathers, but she does not forget what they have done. While the BUGOMIS worry about the problem of extending copyright and other capitalist and patriarchal legalities to the age of electronic text, the cyborg-teacher fills the electronic book- shelf with slave narratives and the diaries of farm women, texts too unimportant to have been copyrighted in their time. Students, mandated to countless hours of keyboarding instruction, use this classroom time to enter these and other narratives of resistance and survival. Within the domain of command and control, cyborgian classes around the world create an excess of texts which escape control. Recognizing technophilia and technophobia as the love- hate binary that sustains technocentrism, the cyborgian teacher is suspicious of them both and frames her teaching in the deconstruction of this pair. A cyborgian reading of research texts concerning educational technology requires different questions than does a reading framed by educa- tional effectiveness or by ideas of goddess-good teaching. A third term: Postmodern witches, mothers, loners Although Haraway frames the choices available for living (and, ipso facto, for teaching) in the future around the binary, cyborg versus goddess, there are other choices available for elaboration, construction, and just trying on to see how they feel. Radical feminists of the last two decades have sought, for example, to reclaim the power of the witch, the crone, and the hag. Under the name of the W.I.T.C.H. , a Wild Independent Thinking Crone and Hag, we might imagine these much-maligned women as teachers. "Witch" is, after all, an appellation hurled at teachers from time to time, not only by rebellious students but also in children's books, rock songs, and other media portrayals. In Websters' First New ¡ntergalactic Wickedary of the English Language, Mary Daly includes the following definitions: Witch: ... an Elemental Soothsayer; one who is in harmony with the rhythms of the universe: Wise Woman, Healer; one who exercises transformative powers: Shape-shifter; - averting disaster, warding off attacks of demons and Magnetizing Elemental Spiritual Forces. (180) Hag: . . . Witch, Fury, Harpy who haunts the Hedges/ Boundaries of patriarchy, frightening fools and sum- moning Weird Wandering Women into the Wild. (137) Crone: .. .Great Hag of History, long-lasting one . . . who has survived the early stages of the Otherworld Journey and who therefore has Dis-cov- ered depths of Courage, Strength, and Wisdom in her Self. (114) The witch/crone/hag is, thus, like the goddess in her transformative powers and like the cyborg, a haunter of hedges and boundaries. Unlike the cyborg whose milieu is surface and boundary, however, the witch is at home with depth and duration; the witch is an old hand with elemental forces. The women of Greenham Common are modern day witches whose understanding and use of elemental forces intersect technology and the findings of science in ways that allow crossings of the high-tech boundaries separating women from (the off-switches of) machines. On one occasion, they use "women's technology" to capture border guards policing the fence around the Greenham nuclear plant; they imprison the guards, motorcycles and all, in a web woven of high-tech cord. Later, the women turn elemental singing into sound waves of precisely the right amplitude and frequency to set swaying and "sing down" the chain-link fence. Feminist fantasy writing is full of similar women/witches who, like Gael Baudino's harpster turned high-tech rocker, use an elemental understanding of science and technologies to cross patriarchal divides. The postmodern witch-teacher, a mythical creature who adapts the methods of the witch/crone/hag both to the classrooms and to the technologies of today, is neither goddess nor cyborg, but always already part goddess and part cyborg. Like the witch-women of Greenham Common, she seeks the elemental aspects of technologies which make them vulnerable and invokes elemental powers against them. In her computerized classroom, this cyber- witch pays no heed to the patriarchal - "don't worry your pretty little head about it, dear" - discourse which positions teachers and students as "not needing to know" about the elemental stuff of which technologies are made - zeros and ones and programs and control. She studies it out and shares it with her students; she reads a row of ones in computer memory as a row of dominos and knows that another "one" in the right register will cause a "domino effect," "zeroing out" the data, and with the data, the control. In these days of magnetic storage and retrieval of data, "Magnetizing Ele- mental Spiritual Forces" (Daly 114) takes on new meaning for her; magnetizing and de-magnetizing go hand in hand. Démystification is her motto. The cyber-witch teacher is dedicated to engaging students in "roboticide, the process of shedding of false selves manufactured in the State of Robotitude, releasing the Wild within" (Daly 160). Roboti- tude, she tells her students, is the "hollow/solid depthless state of servitude marked by the reduction of life to mechanical motion; (a) state characterized by pure repeti- tion of mechanical gestures" (Daly 224). She teaches them 58 ♦ S.K. Damarin</page><page sequence="6">to find routes of escape from this state: on a Disneyland fieldtrip, they seek out the secret passages to the inner workings underground, and they take pictures with their shoes not touching the painted footprints marked "stand here for photo opportunity. " They learn to scramble their Internet messages and to shortcut the structured programs of computer-based instruction. They learn vocabulary for- bidden from the Dolch list, and they speak it with courage, strength, and wisdom. The witch, of course, is not alone in the space of the third term. In response to Haraway, Susan Suleiman sug- gests two other mythical border figures; she writes: "Some- times it is politic to 'be' a goddess, at other times a cyborg - or at still other times a laughing mother or an 'alone standing woman' who sweeps the detritus of civiliza- tion" (205). Suleiman does not theorize or describe the "laughing mother," but we can (still, today) imagine her, laughing as she reties the shoes her daughter has shed at least 30 times today, laughing as she watches the children enjoying the backyard technologies of swings and see-saws, laughing as she watches the children negotiate an Escher castle in a hologram game. She is laughing because she exists outside the world of Freud, Lacan, and even Chodorow and Dr. Spock. She can laugh because she is not weighed down measuring "quality time" and providing "cognitive growth experiences." She is a free spirit who can laugh as she dances with the children on a cyberspace dance floor, together tracing four-dimensional shapes and patterns with their bodies. Each day, she gathers her brood of children, and, like the cyborg, she runs along the networks of informatics until she finds a place where they can dance and laugh in the warm simulacrum of the sun. Can we imagine a "laughing teacher" continuing the joyfulness of the laughing mother? A teacher unconstrained by cognitive learning theories and IEPs? A teacher laughing as she splashes with her students in the simulated seas of an unnamed planet, as they feel the warm equatorial waters on their bio-cyber bodies still back in the wintry midwest. Like the goddess, the laughing teacher is unconstrained by the worldly search for good sex and an income reflecting her "comparable worth." Her laughter is undiminished by the "real world" of children dying from drive-by shootings, of child abuse, and of preparing children for careers which have obsolesced, given way to the economies of postmodern technology. In her classroom, students, too, escape these worldly cares . . . they make joyful noise, tell tall tales, and play hide and seek in the electronic garden. No Norman Rockwell teacher is she, with tightly drawn hair, pointer/ punisher in hand, and on her desk an apple, fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The laughing teacher's hair blows free; in her hand she holds a magic wand, and the fruit on her table is a jar of Tang, simulated postmodern sustenance for long excursions into exciting worlds unchart- able and yet unknown. The "alone standing woman who sweeps the detritus of civilization" is a figure introduced by novelist Christine Brooks-Rose (Suleiman); in bringing her to our attention, Suleiman muses over whether the alone standing woman is sweeping away the detritus of civilization, or sweeping new patterns in it. We can imagine this alone standing woman as a postmodern statue of liberty holding not a beacon but a broom. But, where does she stand in the "global village," The laughing teacher's hair blows free; in her hand she holds a magic wand, and the fruit on her table is a jar of Tang, simulated postmodern sustenance for long excursions into exciting worlds unchartable and yet unknown. this postmodern place where everyone is equally and intimately connected with everyone else? To be "alone standing," she must have one foot in and one foot out of the global village - a border creature of a network that has no border. She is as grounded in the network as the cyborg, but, goddesslike, the alone standing woman escapes the dimensionality of the society she sweeps. Hers is a teach- erly position in the sense that teachers share the humanity of their students, but escapes humanness as it is understood by the youngsters in her class. For the alone standing teacher, her sweeping is her teaching. If the cyber- witch teacher is an agent of démystification, the alone standing teacher is a mystery, always sweeping, but sweeping how? Sometimes she is a feminist pedagogue sweeping new patterns, sweeping the margins into the center of educational practice and attention; sometimes she is a multicultural teacher sweeping away the detritus of scientific racism. Perhaps she can sweep new patterns into the detritus we call technological determinism, and with the new patterns sweep recipes for new and differently valenced technologies. She sweeps "unthinking of educa- tional technology" (Damarin) into the curriculum of teacher education and of schools, and she sweeps new situations in which situated learning can occur. School children play in the piles that she sweeps; they find new treasures in them and build castles of the detritus in the piles. She sweeps spirals in the piles, and together (students and teacher and the ever-present broom) they dance a ceremonial goodbye when she finds and sweeps away a racist controller chip, a patriarchal mindcop, or a shackle meant for them. Can we dance the spiral dance? Speaking of the goddess and the cyborg, Haraway notes that "both are caught in the spiral dance" - dancing with us, and dancing as fast as they can, I expect, along a spiral path in three or more dimensions. The spiral might have Cyborg or Goddess ♦ 59</page><page sequence="7">been a circle, were it not for the hot air of the discourse of technological progress always blowing, pushing the circular arcs up and away in an extra dimension. The spiral is held in to its center by a centripetal force, a pull toward the elemental principles and rhythms of the witch women, toward the spirit and transcendent power of the goddess, the part-human of the cyborg, the joyfulness of the laughing mother, and the firm footing of the alone standing woman. But they/ we are, none of us, faithful to the center; the centrifugal forces that send us packing off in all directions might be as innocent as curiosity or as densely coded as the serpent in the garden. Pushed and pulled - in, out, and up, - we cannot not dance. But, what kind of dance is the spiral dance? The ballet of a Greek goddess? A postmodern march of the toy robot-soldiers? A do-si-do as we circle each other back to back? A clog dance of an alone standing woman? The back and forth of a jitterbug danced with broom in hand? A witches' circle (double, double, toil and trouble)? ... And whom will you choose for a partner? a goddess? a cyborg? an alone standing woman? . . . And who might choose you? a witch? a laughing mother? It is this spiral dance that our schools must teach our children to enjoy. If they are to escape the C3I of the Informatics of Domination, they must learn to dance on the borders of human and machine. Goddess teachers are no longer enough, if ever they were. The cyborg, the laughing * mother, the witch, and the alone standing woman must all be invited to teach in our schools, not to "facilitate" efficient achievement of cognitive objectives and oxy- moronic job skills, but to help our youth to see possibilities for living fully in the electronic moment and the informa- tion age. Teacher education programs must offer apprentice- ship in witchcrafty sweeping, alone standing laughing, cyborgian spellcasting and, yes, the grace of goddesses unfaithful to their fathers. Border teachers/creatures, trained like the goddess to be "takers of all" and like the cyborg to find "pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and responsibility in their construction," must be invited into our schools. Only they can assist our youth in the ironic creation of themselves as ever more human, even as they are constructed as ever more machine. Note 1 .
