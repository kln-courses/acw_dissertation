Stroud and Nancy Bookidis, and the Director Emeritus of the Corinth Excavations, Charles K. Williams, II, for the opportunity to study and publish the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman figurines from the sanctuary. My work on this project has been very much enriched by the information they have provided and by their extremely helpful comments on successive drafts of this manuscript. This study would have been much poorer without their knowledgeable support. I am especially grateful to Dr. Bookidis for her friendship and patient encouragement and for her willing attention to the endless details of an archaeological project of this kind. All errors and omissions, however, are my own. The fine photos are by Ino loannides and Lenio Bartzioti. Stella Bouzaki expertly restored the many figurines in need of attention. I owe warm thanks to Dr. Williams for permission to use and illustrate Corinthian comparanda from excavated areas other than the Demeter sanctuary. The photographs on Plates 78 and 79 are courtesy of the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. Other scholars were most helpful at various stages of this study. Prof. Brunilde S. Ridgway graciously gave her time to read the manuscript, at both earlier and near-final stages, and offered extremely astute and helpful comments. I have also profited greatly from discussions with A. A. Donohue and Jean M. Turfa, and from correspondence with Richard V Nicholls. Dr. Turfa provided much useful information on the Archaic figurines. Rebecca M. Ammerman was especially helpful with suggestions in the area of West Greek archaeology, and with perceptive comments on the manuscript as a whole. Some of the identifications of imported Argive and Sicilian figurines are owed to Martin Guggisberg and Nunzio Allegro respectively. My husband, Irwin L. Merker, greatly eased the writing process with his computer expertise, vast fund of general knowledge, and good humor at difficult times. This project could never have been brought to a successful conclusion without the expertise and kindly patience of the excellent editorial staff of the ASCSA Publications Office. I also owe a large debt to the work of earlier students of terracotta figurines. Chief among these is Reynold A. Higgins, whose wide understanding of the Greek figurines of many centers provided so much fundamental material for later students. The publication of the figurines from Morgantina by Malcolm Bell, III, was a much-admired model for this volume. The basic work of Agnes N. Stillwell and Gladys D. Weinberg on Corinthian figurines has stood the test of time, requiring only the chronological adjustment made necessary by more recent excavation in Corinth. Finally, the perceptive work of Dorothy Burr Thompson on the figurines of Asia Minor and Athens has shown how much can be learned of Greek society from the work of its coroplasts. Financial support for this project was provided through a Rutgers University Summer Fellowship and Faculty Research Grant; a Rutgers University Research Council Publication Subvention; a National Endowment for the Humanities Travel to Collections Grant; and a Fellowship Grant from the 1984 Foundation. Membership at the Institute for Advanced Study during the spring of 1989 provided a welcome opportunity for intensive study.</page><page sequence="7">BIBLIOGRAPHY AND ABBREVIATIONS Agora = The Athenian Agora: Results of Excavations Conducted by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Princeton.

Archaic figurines of the later 7th and 6th centuries B.C., together with Archaic survivals of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., will be published in a later fascicle of this series. Taking all periods together, the quantity of figurines found in the sanctuary was extremely large, reaching a total of more than 24,000 figurines and fragments. This number encompasses a great range in scale, from miniatures to statuettes originally measuring more than ca. 50 cm in height; a corresponding range of different types; and a surprising differential in technique and concept, from plaques stamped out in large numbers, which are pale reflections of their original models, to pieces that, although moldmade, nevertheless preserve something of the freshness of new creations and probably are close to their archetypes. Such diversity is a key element in the Corinthian coroplastic industry as a whole.2 An approximate numerical breakdown of the most popular types can be found on pages 2-4. While publications of smaller collections of figurines sometimes include all fragments, it obviously has been impossible to follow that procedure here, and what is published is a representative selection. It may be helpful to describe how the figurines were processed and how the selection was made. THE COUNTING AND PROCESSING OF THE FIGURINES Initially, all figurines were inventoried as they were excavated. The large amount of material, however, soon made it necessary to inventory only the best preserved and to store the remainder, after washing, together with the lots of context pottery with which they were found.3 All the figurine fragments, no matter how small, were retained. After the excavations were completed and the period of study began, the figurines in the approximately 480 lots that contained them were sorted and counted.4 The initial difficulty was in obtaining an accurate count. It was apparent that few or none of the figurines were in primary deposition, and that a good deal of moving about of earth and of the discarded figurines contained in it, during the various phases of construction in the sanctuary, had resulted in the severe fragmentation and dispersion of many pieces. For example, fragments of the large seated female figurine C93 were retrieved from four 1 For a description of the excavation, see Corinth XVIII, iii. The goddess Kore/Persephone is referred to as "Kore" in this publication, unless the source under discussion uses the name "Persephone." 2 The history of the Corinthian coroplastic industry, as far as it can be determined from evidence currently available, is discussed by the author in an article, "Corinthian Terracotta Figurines: The Development of an Industry," to be published in the Proceedings of the Corinth Centennial Symposium. 3 The pottery found in the sanctuary was organized into lots, each of which consists of finds from a specific area or feature of the excavation. The lot number given in the cat- alogue for each figurine indicates the lot of pottery with which the figurine was found. The lot list on pp. 353-368 provides for each lot the date range of the pottery and a brief description of the archaeological context; if the date of that context is later than the latest date of the pottery, it is so indicated. 4 The total number of pottery lots recovered was 1,158, and less than half contained figurines. The lot list on pp. 353-368 includes only those lots that contained the figurines catalogued or otherwise mentioned in this volume.</page><page sequence="26">2 INTRODUCTION different pottery lots, excavated on both the Lower and Upper Terraces of the sanctuary. Further, since some of the figurines had not been fired very hard, the fragments sometimes were too eroded to show possible joins or crumbled into impossibly small fragments when handled. Even the highly skilled excavation menders had only limited success in restoration. Consequently, it was often impossible to know whether or not a fragment represented the sole remains of a figurine or really belonged with other fragments; the counts therefore should be regarded as approximate. A great deal must really be missing, however, since easily recognizable, thick-walled, large statuettes were represented by only a few fragments. The same is true of much of the terracotta sculpture.5 If so much loss occurred among the sturdier pieces, it must have been still greater among the more fragile figurines. In fact, the figurines that fared best were those of miniature scale, which were usually solid rather than hollow. Even if one allows for possible duplication in the counting, however, the great variety of types and the many variants of standard types speak for a very large production and a common use of figurines as votives in this sanctuary. Since the very last lot of figurines studied contained several new types and variants, the material that did not survive or that remains in the unexcavated area of the sanctuary must be assumed to contain more that is still unknown. It is clear that even the overwhelming quantity of extant material represents only a portion of what was originally dedicated. As each lot of contextually associated figurines was studied, the standard types, such as articu- lated "dolls," easily recognizable even in fragments, were counted and for the most part left with the context pottery. Also left were fragments that could tell little about the original type, such as pieces of plain skirt drapery, limbs, or badly worn heads. It was not unusual for such indeterminate pieces to make up more than half the figurine fragments in a lot. The better-preserved or more in- formative pieces were withdrawn, marked with the lot number, photographed in groups, and held for further study. The best of these were later inventoried, and a selection showing all identifiable types then was made from the total inventory for the catalogues in this publication. Therefore, the catalogues and discussions of the figurines in this study include both material with formal inventory (MF) numbers and some pieces identified only by the lot number of the pottery with which they were found. Multiple examples are recorded under the appropriate catalogue entries. The approximate counts of the figurines give some idea of the numbers of such votives offered at the sanctuary in different periods. Of the more than 24,000 figurines or fragments excavated, ca. 1,800 were Archaic or Archaic survivals. Of that number, ca. 510, including both handmade and partially moldmade figurines, demonstrably belong to the 7th and 6th centuries B.C., the larger proportion of the total being Archaic survivals of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. Archaic survivals include types that were made continuously from the Archaic to the Classical period and others first made in the Classical period in a lingering Archaic style. Since the count for the Roman period was only ca. 30 pieces, most of the figurines, whether Archaic, Classical, or Hellenistic in style, were dedicated between the 5th century and 146 B.C. Within these parameters, allowing for the chronological difficulties discussed below (pp. 5-7), the time of the most prolific production and dedication appears to have been the 4th century B.C., when an increase in wealth after the Peloponnesian War (see p. 1 15) apparently supported votive activities. At this time, numerous new types were created while concurrently, until the 320s B.C., the workshops of the Potters' Quarter were continuing their conservative production. The largest single concentration of figurines, in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, belongs mostly to the 4th century B.C. The survival of some of the new 4th-century B.C. types into the 3rd century, and the paucity of closely datable contexts, makes impossible an accurate numerical division of figurines between these two centuries, but there was a probable drop in production during the 3rd century B.C. for two reasons: 5 The publication of the terracotta sculpture is forthcoming in a later fascicle of Corinth XVIII by Nancy Bookidis.</page><page sequence="27">INTRODUCTION 3 the prolific Potters' Quarter workshops were no longer active at that time, and fewer new types were introduced by other workshops. There appears to have been a serious numerical and qualitative diminution in production about the middle to third quarter of the 3rd century B.C., followed by a spurt of new types and renewed quality in the last quarter of the 3rd century to 146 B.C. The numerical proportion of Archaic figurines is low, but figurines do not appear to have been dedicated at the sanctuary until the last quarter of the 7th century B.C., when coroplastic production in Corinth got under way,6 so that we are comparing only one and one-quarter centuries of Archaic dedications with those of the three and one-half centuries of the post-Archaic sanctuary. Further, the largest proportion of pottery belongs to the 6th and 5th centuries B.C., while the largest proportion of figurines belongs to the 4th. There may have been some change in custom over time, from an emphasis on votive pots to figurines. We cannot know, however, whether the stimulus for this development was an actual change in ritual that required figurines or an industrial change that put on the market fewer or less attractive votive pots but more desirable figurines. There may have been a connection between coroplasts and workshops manufacturing small bronzes, especially in the 4th century B.C. (see p. 343), that resulted in the availability of very fine figurines. While the repertoire was extremely diverse, especially in the Hellenistic period, when many fine types are known in just a few examples, some popular types or categories discussed in the following chapters can be isolated and counted. Their relative surviving numbers should have some bearing on their cultic importance, as explained in the discussion of the various types in their appropriate chapters. For the reader's convenience, the count of these types is summarized here. The numbers listed below include catalogued figurines, as well as others that received Corinth Museum inventory numbers, but were not selected for cataloguing in this publication, and still more that were only counted and stored with the lots of context pottery. The numbers are approximate. Although the count of 7th- and 6th-century B.C. types and their survivals will be provided in the forthcoming publication of the Archaic figurines, the count of new types of lingering Archaic style that were first produced in the 5th century B.C. is included here7 to establish them as part of the production of the Classical period. The following list, clearly, does not include all the figurines of each period but only the most popular and clearly recognizable types. Lingering Archaic types (5th-4th centuries B.C.) standing "korai": ca. 230 seated goddesses: ca. 90 heads of"korai" or goddesses: ca. 30 "dolls": ca. 60 spoon-based protomes: ca. 25 plaques (Gorgon, sphinx, rooster): ca. 60 Classical types, including survivals (5th-4th centuries B.C., a few 3rd) "dolls": nude: ca. 810 draped: ca. 120 banqueters: ca. 55 standing youths: ca. 55 seated children: ca. 45 hydriaphoroi: ca. 30 standing female votaries: ca. 25 protomes: ca. 25 6 Merker, forthcoming. 7 I thank Jean M. Turfa for the counts of Archaic and surviving Archaic figurines.</page><page sequence="28">4 INTRODUCTION Early Hellenistic types, including survivals (4th-3rd centuries B.C.) standing female votaries: ca. 285 children (all types): ca. 90 Middle Hellenistic type (3rd-2nd centuries B.C.) "priestesses": ca. 175 The count of the "dolls" is based on their reliably recognizable torsos, which usually were cast solid, making them much more durable than the more common hollow-cast figurines. Consequently, the count of "dolls" seems overwhelmingly large in relation to the rest of the figurines. The separately made limbs of these "dolls," which, although solid, were much more vulnerable in the unfavorable conditions of preservation in the sanctuary (see p. 8), survived at only about half the rate of the torsos. Even when the count of the "dolls" is adjusted for this factor, however, the type still remains the one most commonly found, and presumably dedicated, at the Sanctuary. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MATERIAL The organization of any collection of material must be determined by both its inherent nature and its context. Some collections of figurines might best be organized on the basis of their manufacture, that is, as products of one or more workshops. Although the material here under study allows some small workshop groupings of figurines to be made on the basis of such criteria as technique, scale, and style, the material as a whole is so diverse that most of the figurines do not have identifiable workshop mates and therefore cannot be so organized. The material is very different in character from that of Archaic Sicily, for example, where large deposits of well- preserved figurines of limited typology have been found, which are very well suited to mechanical study.8 Further, the workmanship of Classical and Hellenistic Corinthian figurines, with its heavy retouch and creativity in regard to variants, tends to distort and obscure the mold series at the heart of coroplastic technique. The primary purpose of figurines found in a cultic context should be to further the understanding of the cult, particularly when that understanding depends largely on archaeological sources. The best-possible organization of this material is therefore by subject, within the different periods, since the types provide the imagery that conveys the ideas of the cult, and typological development from one period to another may reflect cultic changes. Mechanical relationships are recorded in the catalogues, and a summary of workshops (pp. 344-346) brings together figurines of different types that may have been manufactured together. A typological organization also emphasizes the wide range of approaches at a given pe- riod among different Corinthian artisans. For example, the Classical seated female figurines (pp. 42-47) encompass several updated versions of Archaic coroplastic types, even including the combined handmade/moldmade technique, as well as larger, entirely new creations stylis- tically dependent upon stone sculpture. Another advantage is that pastiches of various elements can be placed most effectively by subject, as can fragments that reveal only limited mechanical information, of which there are many in this collection of figurines. As in many archaeological collections of figurines, there are numerous isolated heads that, because they are solid, survived their more fragile torsos. Rather than collect these heads in a sort of extended rogues' gallery, they have been distributed according to their probable original use, among better-preserved figurines to which they are related, if not mechanically, at least typologically or stylistically. It should be kept in mind, however, that a given head type was often used with widely differing torsos. 8 E.g., Sguaitamatti 1984, and rev. by Ammerman 1986.</page><page sequence="29">INTRODUCTION 5 THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS AND CHRONOLOGY A close dating of the figurines has been precluded by the character both of the material and of the site. With regard to the coroplastic medium itself, putting aside archaeological context for the moment, every figurine has two dates, a stylistic date (determined by the style of the archetype from which the mold was taken) and the mechanical date of its actual manufacture in the workshop.9 The latter date is extremely difficult to determine, since molds theoretically could have been in use over long periods or even brought back into production after a long period of disuse. Further, the pace of production during a given mold series is impossible to determine, regardless of the number of generations documented, since some types could have been produced in large numbers overer a relatively short time, while others lingered for a longer period. Therefore, the stylistic date is very important, although it can provide only a terminus post quem. The stylistic date is most useful for figurines that are not part of any presently known mold series and show clear mold impressions. In these cases, where there may have been only one generation, the date of manufacture may be close to the stylistic date of the archetype, unless something much older was employed for this purpose. A time lag between figurine and archetype is theoretically possible, since a mold could have been taken from an archetype at any time after the creation of the latter. Because there is no reason to assume a habitually long time lag between archetype and mold in the very large Corinthian coroplastic production, however, archetypal dates can sometimes be very useful. A group that must be dated with particular care is the 4th-century B.C. production of the Potters' Quarter. Here, lingering Archaic or Classical elements were often combined with Early Hellenistic features, the whole pastiche sometimes executed with a kind of folk-art naivete; in such cases, the latest stylistic elements should provide the terminus post quem for the figurines. With regard to the archaeological contexts in which the figurines were found, there are only a few helpful fixed points owing to the disturbances of repeated construction in the tes attlimited area of the sanctuary.10 In almost all the lots containing both figurines and pottery, the figurines confirm the dates derived from the pottery, if one uses as chronological criteria archetypal style or contextual evidence available from outside the sanctuary. In a few cases, the date of a figurine seems to be later than the latest pottery in a lot, as indicated in the lot list (pp. 353-368), and there is an occasional lot with only Roman pottery but Greek figurines. Unfortunately, a great many of the lots consist of pottery of mixed date, sometimes ranging from the Archaic to the Roman periods, and the figurines are similarly mixed in date. In the discussion of the figurines in the following chapters, the term "pottery context" refers to the latest date of the pottery with which a figurine was found. The terms "archaeological context" and "architectural context" refer to the overall date of the context, which may be later than the pottery. The nature of an archaeological context will determine how accurately it can date the period of use of a figurine. In a single undisturbed burial, for example, figurines would have been deposited at the same time as the pottery; if the latter is datable, it fixes the time of use of the figurines, which in most cases should also be close to the time of manufacture, although burials sometimes contain heirlooms. The archaeological contexts of the Acrocorinth sanctuary, however, often include material accumulated over a period of time. The latest datable material in such a lot, whether pottery, coins, lamps, or figurines, is only a terminus ante quem and does not necessarily date the period of use of all the figurines in that archaeological context. For example, the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., contained a few figurines made in the 6th century and discarded long before but introduced in the earth that was gathered for the construction fill. It also contained figurines 9 Troy, p. 20. "0 Corinth XVIII, iii, p. xxi.</page><page sequence="30">6 INTRODUCTION in a lingering Archaic style, consisting of types known to have been made in the Potters' Quarter during the 5th and 4th centuries, perhaps until the closure of the workshops there in the 320s B.C. This material also was no longer current when the Trapezoidal Building was constructed. For the remaining 4th-century B.C. figurines, the terminal date of the fill serves only as a terminus ante quem, and other means must be used to try to date them more closely. The most stylistically advanced figurines are the ones most likely to have been in use near the terminal date; those of somewhat earlier style, given the lingering tendencies of figurines, may or may not have still been in use at the terminal date. 11 A reasonable rule of thumb is that the date of manufacture and use of a figurine falls between its stylistic and contextual dates. In her study of the Greek pottery from the sanctuary, in the absence of true closed deposits, Pemberton isolated eleven context groups of pottery.12 Of these, the most useful context for dating the figurines is the above-mentioned construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building on the Middle Terrace of the sanctuary, the pottery from which is mainly later 4th century B.C. in date, the latest dating to the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. 13 This is not a sealed deposit, but there are only two later sherds among the very large quantity of pottery found in the fill. Two heads among the approximately 1,800 figurines should be later; one is of the Middle Hellenistic "priestess" type (a mechanical relative of the head of H401) and the other, a "doll's" head (C159), shows the surface blistering that indicates the use of a plaster mold. Otherwise the material from this deposit is of 4th-century B.C. style, with a small admixture of earlier material. The deposit exhibits a good range of Early Hellenistic types, but it is as useful for what it excludes. It can be assumed provisionally, until further evidence proves otherwise, that an Early Hellenistic type that is not represented in this large and varied cache was not created until the 3rd century B.C. Another archaeological context that is of some utility is lot 3217, a mass of discarded pottery found on the Lower Terrace, the latest of which dates to the mid- to later 3rd century B.C., with more than 200 figurines; this material is thought to have been cleared from a pit and discarded in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. 14 The latest figurines in this lot are still recognizably Early Hellenistic in type; none of the types that are Middle Hellenistic in style are represented there, which suggests that the new types were not introduced until the last quarter of the 3rd century B.C. Unfortunately, there is considerably less contextual assistance for dating the figurines of the 5th and earlier 4th centuries B.C. Only lot 887 (Pit A), which contained twelve figurines in the filling of a pit with a deposit of 5th-century B.C. kalathiskoi,15 provides a dated context for a small number of types. In addition to these three useful context groups, there are occasionally lots in which figurines appear with a small amount of pottery that is not mixed in date. While these lots are not as reliable for dating as those in the context groups, they are mentioned in the discussion whenever they occur. In the absence of contextual evidence at the sanctuary for some figurine types, well- documented finds of figurines from other sites in Corinth are sometimes helpful. For exam- ple, a few figurines similar to those from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, especially of children, were found in undisturbed graves in the North Cemetery, together with datable pottery.16 The Forum Southwest excavations undertaken in the 1970s uncovered a variety of figurines, a few of them 11 Similarly, in the Athenian Agora, the Coroplasts' Dump, dated by its pottery to the third quarter of the 4th century, was "composed of three distinct groups: a) Vestigial fragments, dat- ing as early as 470-400 B.c., b) Conservative types of late fifth and early fourth century style, still in production, c) Contem- porary figures in contemporary style" (R. V Nicholls, quoted in D. B.

For example, a grave group in Argos21 contains figurines together with a Corinthian unglazed lekanis with stepped lid, a type introduced just before the middle of the 5th century B.C.22 When these chronological resources fail, stylistic or iconographic relationships can sometimes be established with sculpture, particularly votive reliefs, or occasionally with vase painting, to date approximately the archetype of a figurine. Drawing connections with figurines from other coroplastic centers can be difficult, since local preferences for type and style tended to be strong. Further, other figurines are subject to the same chronological problems inherent in the medium as are Corinthian figurines, making them unreliable as fixed points. It is apparent that even when archaeological context provides some assistance, the figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary can be dated reliably only within rather wide parameters, and any further refinement of this framework must rest on style and comparisons with work in other media. In presenting the figurines in the discussions and catalogues that follow, the nature of coroplastic work has been accommodated by including later repetitions of types within the period of their conception. Hence the chapter entitled "Classical Figurines and Their Survivals" includes figurines of 5th-century B.C. type and style that were still being made well into the 4th, and the chapter "Early Hellenistic Figurines and Their Survivals" includes 4th-century B.C. types that may have lingered into the later 3rd century. The chapter on Middle Hellenistic figurines does not include survivals, since the sanctuary was closed during the Late Hellenistic period, which corresponds with the interim period following the destruction of 146 B.C. The considerably smaller quantity of material for the Middle Hellenistic than for the Classical or Early Hellenistic period is likely to owe something to this circumstance, emphasizing how much of the production habitually centered on earlier, lingering types. It is important to note that the conventional dating of the Hellenistic period to begin ca. 330 B.C. does not work very well for Corinthian figurines, since departures from Classical practice in both iconography and style are evident by the middle of the 4th century B.C. and probably already in the second quarter. The middle and third quarter of the 4th century B.C. may have been a time of particularly fertile creativity. Hence, apart from figurines of the early 4th century B.C., which artistically still belong to the tradition of the later 5th, and apart from obvious Archaic or 5th-century B.C. survivals into the 4th century, the term "Early Hellenistic" more accurately describes 4th-century B.C. Corinthian figurines than the term "Classical." For the purposes of this study, the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. is taken as the approximate dividing point between Early and Middle Hellenistic. Questions of terminology and dating are discussed more fully in the appropriate chapters (see pp. 23, 115-116, 249). 7 E.g., C. K.

These activities also inhibit our understanding of precisely where in the sanctuary the figurines originally were deposited as offerings and in what manner.23 One certain piece of evidence is that most of the figurines were concentrated on the Upper and Middle Terraces, particularly the latter, where ritual activities are thought to have been especially concentrated.24 Very few figurines, and these fragmentary, were found in and around the dining rooms of the Lower Terrace, from which one may conclude that figurines were not involved in the ritual activities of this area. Figurines from the Upper Terrace were probably incorporated into the earth filling used to level the sloping bedrock, dumped behind the retaining walls at the bottom of the terrace; consequently, the dedication of figurines cannot be connected with any structure there. Generally speaking, the likeliest area for the ritual deposition of figurines is the Middle Terrace, although it is difficult to make specific connections between structures and figurines; after the construction of the Trapezoidal Building ca. 300 B.C., figurines could have been deposited there temporarily before being dumped elsewhere in the sanctuary, but there is no physical evidence to demonstrate this. Further, the evidence for the ritual deposition of figurines in pits or other votive receptacles is problematic. It is uncertain whether figurines were deposited directly into pits together with or instead of votive vessels, or whether they were placed on or around altars, and perhaps were swept aside or buried in pits later. Pit A (lot 887), the pottery of which dates from the late 6th through the 5th centuries B.C.,25 contained some figurines, but their fragmentary condition makes ritual deposition questionable, and the lack of a dominant type or at least thematically related types is not encouraging.26 Probably this pit received pottery ritually, while figurines originally offered elsewhere in the sanctuary, perhaps nearby, were later dumped into the pit with the earth filling. Pit E (lot 4351, late 6th to early second quarter of the 5th century B.C.), which also received pottery ritually, to judge from the predominance of kalathiskoi in the deposit,27 contained only one figurine fragment of indeterminate type. Visitors to the sanctuary may have placed a pot but apparently not a figurine in this pit before entering the Middle Terrace. Pit B (lot 880) in the Trapezoidal Building received burned animal sacrifices, but the figurines and other objects in it probably belong to the earth dumped into the pit when it went out of use and was filled, near the middle of the 3rd century B.C.28 A more convincing possibility of ritual deposition of a figurine is from the pottery pocket in Room E;29 this pocket of material was gathered in a corner and fenced in with a large tile. The pocket contained the 5th-century B.C. spoon-based protome MF-12057,30 which is intact and therefore may have been deposited there in the course of a ritual, although it is odd that it is the only figurine among the pottery. A larger quantity of figurines was found in lot 3217,31 which is thought to represent material cleaned from a votive pit of the 3rd century B.C.32 While it may be true that at least some of this material comes from a pit, and some of the figurines do match the 23 Evidence for the ritual placement of figurines in sanc- tuaries has been collected and discussed by Ammerman in Coroplast's Art, pp. 42-43, with bibliography; see also Alroth 1988. 24 Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 53, 247. 25 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 89-90; Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 161- 162. 26 The types are as follows: Classical-standing nude male (C191), "doll's" head (C125), bird (V9), hand with alabas- tron (V26), seated female (MF-10942, catalogued with C82); Archaic and lingering Archaic-female head (MF- 10543), mini- ature handmade seated female (MF-10539), fragment of a chi- toniskos "doll" (MF-10538), worn head of"kore" (MF-10943); uninventoried fragments-standing "kore," protome(?), worn seated female, three of indeterminate type. 27 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 87-88; Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 163- 166. 28 Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 243-245. 29 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 84-87; Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 159. 30 Publication forthcoming. 31 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 101-103. 32 Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 211.</page><page sequence="33">INTRODUCTION 9 3rd-century B.C. date of the pottery, there are also in this lot types of the 4th century or earlier.33 This long chronological range makes it likely that material from more than one source contrib- uted to the group, although the latest figurines could have been ritually deposited in the pit. The difficulty of connecting particular figurine types with areas of the sanctuary, except in the most general way, is well illustrated by the distribution of the easily recognizable Middle Hellenistic "priestess" figurines (pp. 250-255). Among the ca. 175 examples of this type, the largest cluster (28 examples) is from lot 870, which was excavated on the Middle Terrace at grid O-Q25. It is therefore possible that figurines of this type originally were dedicated in a structure or at an altar near this location, although the finds in this lot come from fill dumped to level the sloping bedrock, unconnected with any structure.34 A smaller cluster of this type, less than ten figurines from lot 2107, was excavated from the Upper Terrace at Q-S: 17-20, a fair distance to the west; as mentioned above, the figurines from the Upper Terrace probably were brought there with the earth filling dumped behind the retaining walls. Still other examples were found scattered widely on the Lower Terrace, singly or in small multiples. The likely explanation for this distribution, that the "priestess" figurines were moved away from their original point of collection (on the Middle Terrace?) during building operations of the Roman period, still does not help to pinpoint their actual place of dedication. CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC COROPLASTIC TECHNIQUES The fundamental technique common to coroplasts everywhere (the progression from archetype to molds and thence to generations of figurines) has been well described elsewhere35 and will not be repeated here. The purpose of this discussion is to add to previous publications36 what can be learned from the Acrocorinth sanctuary material about the technical aspects of Corinthian Classical and Hellenistic figurines. The discussion of technique will include the following: scale; fabric; color; slip and paint; archetypes; molding and modeling; the attachment of parts; plaster molds; tools; backs and venting; the effect of technique on style; and the definition of quality in figurines. A selection of bases has been catalogued and discussed below (pp. 274-276). SCALE The scale of the figurines varied greatly, from miniatures of a few centimeters in height to statuettes of more than one-third life size. There does not seem to be any particular correlation of size and chronological period, except that the new types introduced in the Middle Hellenistic period tended to be larger in scale than their forerunners. Factors determining scale must have originated both outside and inside the workshop. Since larger figurines must have been relatively expensive for consumers, general economic conditions must have played some role in the coroplast's choice of scale. The cost and availability of clay, or access to clay beds and kiln space, also would have been pressing matters for the artisan. The primary determining factor, however, may have been the availability of workshop materials at the time a batch of figurines was to be made. That is, the determinants were the molds that were on hand or could be borrowed or purchased; or, in the absence of molds, the archetypes that were available, either in the form of finished products, such as miniature figurines in precious metal or larger bronze statuettes, or in the form of the wax or clay models used by metalsmiths to make such objects. Since it is difficult for the reader to visualize the size of a complete figure from the measurement in centimeters of a fragment, each catalogued piece has been assigned a numbered size range, 33 E.g., the 4th-century B.C. C36, as well as uninventoried "dolls," a horse-rider, and a banqueter. 34 Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 250. 35 Especially British Museum I, pp. 3-7; Nicholls 1952; Nich- olls 1982; Nicholls 1984; Thasos XVII, pp. 27-47; Muller 1997. 36 Corinth XII, pp. 9-15; Corinth XV, i, pp. 82-87.</page><page sequence="34">10 INTRODUCTION taken from the list below. In each catalogue entry, after the measurement, a number in parentheses indicates the size range to which the piece belongs, based on an estimation of the size when complete. This can only be approximate, since some fragments are quite small; where there is doubt and a figurine seems to fall between two size ranges, both numbers are given (e.g., 3-4). The original size of each figurine has been calculated without the base, which is seldom preserved, but the size ranges are broad enough that the presence or absence of a base usually will not make any difference. The size ranges are listed below; most of the figurines fall into ranges 2 or 3: 1. Miniatures, from 0.03 to 0.08 in height. Because they are very small and are usually solid, these figurines are often completely preserved. Theoretically, members of this group could be so small because they have lost scale at the end of a mold series, but usually they are well formed and detailed, like the comic dancer H365, and are better explained as copies of miniatures in precious metal.37 2. Small figurines, up to ca. 0.15 in height. 3. Larger figurines, still held comfortably in the hand, up to ca. 0.25 in height. 4. Small statuettes, up to ca. 0.50 in height. For this category and the one following, the term "statuette" is used to express a difference from the relatively small "figurines." The larger pieces sometimes are all or partly handmade and often approach monumental sculpture in style (see, e.g., the Classical seated peplophoros C93 and the Hellenistic head H431). 5. Larger statuettes, more than 0.50 in height. Because the largest pieces are so fragmentary, the upper end of this size range cannot be determined precisely. FABRIC The term "fabric" is used here specifically to describe the material of the figurines after firing; it is not synonymous with the raw material, for which the term "clay" is used.38 Thus, although five fabrics have been visually distinguished and described below, it is probable that all these derived from a very few clay beds, the visual variants being the result of different handling and firing of the clay by many hands over a period of time. Often, mold siblings are in different fabrics, which emphasizes the essential similarity of the material from one fabric to another; another batch of clay or a different artisan handling it could have been responsible for the resulting fabric. Such fabric distinctions among mold siblings have been noted in the catalogue. Only the very best one, fabric 4, which was used for relatively few figurines, may have been made from a distinctly better clay. In an ancient craft depending largely for its success on the personal judgments and experience of individual artisans, it is natural that there would have been differences in the washing of the clay, the use of various tempering materials, the thickness to which the walls were built, and the surface finishing, all of which would have influenced the outcome. In addition, there must have been differences in kiln construction, the artisans' judgment of heat, and the length of firing allowed. Ideally, every figurine should be analyzed in a laboratory to determine the origin of the clay and the methods of manufacture, but since this is obviously impossible when dealing with thousands of figurines, provisional identification must rest on close visual study and description. Corinthian fabrics are usually fine in texture, the local clay tending to be very clean in its natural state.39 The best clay, however, at least after the Archaic period, may have been saved mostly for pottery, where quality of fabric was important functionally, mixtures of good and lesser clays being used for figurines. Sometimes, as in fabric 5, sparse, very small gray, dark red or occasionally white inclusions are visible, suggesting that clays of lesser quality necessitated the use of temper. These inclusions appear to be the same as those employed for Corinthian household pottery and "tile fabric."40 Sparkling inclusions are rare in Corinthian fabrics, although they do 37 None has been found in Corinth, but for a gold miniature figurine from Argos, see Daux 1968, pp. 1029, 1036, fig. 28. 38 On Corinthian clays and fabrics, seeJones 1984, p. 23; Jones et al. 1986, pp. 173-189; Farnsworth 1964, p. 224; Farnsworth 1970; Farnsworth et al. 1977; Fillieres et al. 1983; Corinth XV, ii, pp. 4-7; Corinth XII, pp. 9-10; Perachora I, p. 192. 39 Farnsworth 1964, p. 224. 40 Farnsworth 1964, p. 224.</page><page sequence="35">INTRODUCTION 11 occasionally appear in small quantities in terracotta sculpture41 and in figurines, perhaps as a result of a small admixture of sand to the clay. Such inclusions, however, are sparse. When Corinthian and Attic figurines are similar in color, the latter can be distinguished by the appearance in strong light of abundant, very tiny sparkling inclusions throughout the fabric. Most Corinthian figurines were not fired very hard, with the exception of fabrics 3 and 4, which have the thinnest walls. Many Corinthian figurines, when touched, leave a slight powdery deposit on the hands. This softness may be, in part, the cause of the blurred modeling seen in so many Corinthian figurines; that is, the blurring may have been caused as much by surface wear during the figurines' period of use and burial as by the use of dull molds. Sometimes, when fragments of a figurine have become separated, upon mending one may show more alteration to the fabric than another, depending on the conditions of burial.42 To avoid unnecessary repetition in the catalogue, the different fabrics will be referred to there by number, and a full description given only in this chapter. Full descriptions will appear in the catalogue only in the case of imported figurines and for a few figurines whose fabrics do not quite fit within the range of any of the numbered fabrics, but that seem nevertheless to be Corinthian. The five different fabrics that can be distinguished visually are the following: Fabric 1: This fabric, the most commonly employed, appears in Early Classical figurines and remained in use into Hellenistic times. It was employed for size ranges 2-5 and is usually the fabric of the largest pieces. The walls are up to 0.025 in thickness in the larger examples. The texture is soft and usually fine, but sparse inclusions occasionally are found; they are small and in color are gray, dark red, and less often white. There are sometimes voids as well, indicating burned-out organic temper; the use of temper is to be expected in larger and thicker pieces. The most common colors are orange-buff, shades of buff, and orange, sometimes shading from one to another within the same figurine. Fabric 2: This fabric is first seen in 5th-century B.C. figurines but is more characteristic of the 4th century. It was employed for figurines in size ranges 2-4, with relatively thick walls, ca. 0.008, for their size. The texture is fine and soft. The distinctive feature of this fabric is a smooth, almost soapy surface, which seems to have been achieved by applying a fine self-slip, which was then polished. Since the white slip applied over the polished surface is better preserved on more of these pieces than is usually the case on Corinthian figurines, it is possible that the polishing was done to enhance the adhesion of the white slip and hence of the colored paints. The polishing may have eliminated minute gaps in the surface that would cause the white slip to flake off. Certainly the smooth surface would have been entirely covered and could not have been appreciated except by the artisans themselves. Figurines in this fabric often show very blurred modeling, which may have been caused in part by the polishing. The color varies from light orange to buff, sometimes shading from one color to another within the same figurine. Figurines in fabric 2 may have been made of the same clay as those in fabric 1, the difference in appearance being the result of the polishing of the surface. In H137, the back of the figure is in fabric 1, while the front is fabric 2; apparently only the front was polished. Fabric 3: This fabric is found in many figurines from the Potters' Quarter, particularly those of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. It was used mainly for small, thin-walled figurines in size ranges 1-2; the walls are sometimes as little as 0.003 in thickness. The texture is fine and the firing is hard, probably due to the thinness of the walls. When figurines in fabric 3 are lightly struck, a clear, clinking sound is heard. The color ranges from creamy buff to pinkish orange, sometimes shading 41 E.g., in SF-40-6, a thigh fragment from a terracotta metope, the middle semifine layer contains small, sparkling inclusions, Weinberg 1957, pp. 317-318, no. 45b, pl. 73; see British Museum I, p. 240, for a few "micaceous" Corinthian figurines. The term "mica" is sometimes used indiscriminately for all sparkling inclusions. Corinthian fabrics usually do not contain real mica; on the nature of micas in non-Corinthian Greek fabrics, see Farnsworth 1964, pp. 222-223. 42 The same phenomenon has been observed in the pottery from the sanctuary, Corinth XVIII, ii, p. 90, note 13.</page><page sequence="36">12 INTRODUCTION from one color to another within the same piece. When not fired as hard as usual, it resembles fabric 1, from which it is distinguishable mainly by its thin walls. Fabric 4: This is one of the best Corinthian figurine fabrics, dating from the late 5th to the 4th centuries B.C., but it is relatively uncommon. The figurines are in size ranges 2-4. They are fairly thin-walled for their size, for example, ca. 0.005 in size range 4. The texture is fine and the firing is hard. The modeling is crisp and clear. The colors are buff, tan, or orange, sometimes shading from one color to another within a single piece. In one well-made piece (H66), only the front was made of fabric 4, the back being made of the more common and less fine fabric 1. Fabric 5: This is a fabric commonly found in 3rd-century B.C. figurines from the sanctuary, in size ranges 2-3.43 It is coarse, friable, and laminated in fracture. Most examples show voids and inclusions similar to those occasionally found in fabric 1, but the inclusions are more often white. Occasionally there are sparse small, sparkling inclusions as well. The color range is generally similar to that of fabric 1 but with the addition of bright orange and ochre. When ochre or light tan, it somewhat resembles the fabric of some Boeotian figurines. The friability of this fabric is probably owed, at least in part, to poor firing, but the general coarseness of the material reflects the use of inferior clays. The poverty of this fabric suggests that some artisans of the 3rd century B.C. were unable to obtain clay of good quality and perhaps also sufficient fuel for firing. Since we do not know how the local natural resources were controlled and distributed, whether clay beds and stands of wood and brush for fuel were on public land or privately owned, and how the artisan went about obtaining what he needed, we cannot know exactly what this drop in standards meant in economic or social terms. Because some good work was produced at least in the first half of the 3rd century B.C. (e.g., the popular type showing a boy with a goose [H331]) and since technical standards rose again in the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries B.C., when a new and quite impressive repertoire of types was introduced, it would be inaccurate to speak of depletion of resources as the cause, although this is inevitable to some extent. There may have been instead some rupture in the established system of artisanship, so that some workers lost the ability either to practice the craft as before or to hand down expertise to the next generation. COLOR Color is the factor most often noted in fabric descriptions, yet it may be the least important from the point of view of distinguishing one fabric from another, since it is so dependent upon kiln conditions. Further, Corinthian figurines often shade from one color to another within the same piece. The texture of a fabric, which should be more diagnostic of the original qualities of a clay and should point to the methods used in handling it, was the main criterion used to develop the list of five fabrics given above. I have attempted to record the colors of the figurines in a manner as useful to the reader as possible. Color description is a notoriously difficult problem, not only because color names are very subjective but also because the customary tool, the Munsell Soil Color Charts, is not always accurate for objects of fired clay; unfortunately, this is especially true of Corinthian objects. The C.E.C. charts,44 which record the colors of fired ceramics, are much more accurate, but not all Corinthian colors are represented on them. The list below provides approximate readings on the Munsell charts for the color names given in the catalogue entries. In most cases, a range of readings is given, within which a particular shade falls; these ranges also allow for variations from one piece to another. The C.E.C. readings, when provided, are very close. It is hoped that the color names will to some degree evoke the variation in color of Corinthian figurines to 43 See also Davidson 1942, p. 106. 44 Federation Europeenne des Fabricants de Carreaux Ceramiques, C.E.C.

The data are rather scanty, and it is not entirely clear how many of these figurines are imports. Only one of the Roman fabrics, a pale, hard-fired material in use in the 2nd century A.C. (see p. 312), really resembles any of the Corinthian figurine fabrics of the Greek period. SLIP AND PAINT The conditions of burial of the figurines did not favor the preservation of paint, but there are sufficient remains of white slip to show that its use was habitual under the paint. The first use of white slip in Corinth can be dated at least to the early 5th century B.C.45 Occasionally, however, paint was applied directly to the surface, as on the Hellenistic protome H388, the mask C268, and the male head C280. The paint on the mask may have been applied before firing. In the child's head C238, paint was applied over slip on the face but directly to the clay on the headdress. In a few carefully painted pieces (e.g., a "doll's" head, C129), a thin, bluish white wash was applied to the surface and then a thick white slip over it. Thick slip often must have virtually concealed lightly modeled faces, and in such cases, the colorists essentially must have been painting features from scratch on a blank surface. In good pieces (e.g., H99), the slip may be glossy. Yellow was used as an underpainting for gilding, presumably to make a thin coating of the expensive material seem more brilliant and to hide potential chips or gaps in the gold. It was 45 Coinnth XV ii, pp. 5-6, note 10; Perachora I, p. 192; for white slip on a Corinthian terracotta sculptured head (SF-1980-1), dated ca. 490-475 B.C., see C. K. Williams and Russell 1981, pp. 31-33, no. 11, pl. 9.</page><page sequence="38">14 INTRODUCTION used in this way on drapery (V27) and on the hair of female heads (e.g., H225). Even when flecks of gilding are not preserved, it is likely that areas of yellow paint, as on the hair of the well-made female head C142, originally were gilded. Female flesh was painted pink (e.g., H65) or ivory white (e.g., the "doll's" head C129), but pink could also be used for the flesh of youths, as on the banqueter C213. There is one example of the use of pink as an underpaint for red on flesh (V28). A subtle pale pink shade is found on the faces of children (H348 and H349), and a peach-pink on the pig V1. Figurine painting could be a rather garish, slapdash affair, but the use of subtler shades and the almost enamel-like quality of the aforementioned ivory paint point to a greater degree of expertise and sophistication. Other colors are a bright blue, which Higgins has recognized as characteristically Corin- thian46 and which appears on drapery from the sanctuary (e.g., H101) and a delicate violet on the drapery of a seated nymph (H282).47 It is clear that the better workshops, at least in the 4th century B.C., finished their figurines with care. ARCHETYPES I have discussed elsewhere48 the possibility that at least some of the archetypes used by Corinthian coroplasts were developed from the models made for small bronzes, perhaps by artisans whose specialty was model making. In the indirect casting of bronzes, which has recently been studied in great detail,49 an original model was created in clay, from which master molds were taken. From these molds wax casts were made to serve as working models. These waxes could be altered and detailed as desired to provide a series of variants of the original model. During the bronze-casting process, only the wax working model was destroyed, leaving both the original model and the master molds intact for further use. This method of altering a basic type to produce variants, sometimes quite distinct from one another, is very like the procedures used by coroplasts. A number of archetypes could be developed from one model by taking a number of casts and altering limb positions, facial features, coiffures, attributes, costume, and even gender. From these slightly or radically varying archetypes evolved distinct but related mold series producing successively smaller generations of figurines. In figurine making, therefore, one may speak of serial production in two ways: the "vertical" or mold series, and the "horizontal" or iconographic series that results from alterations to the original design. This fundamental similarity of method and the references of some figurines to metalwork (noted in the discussion of the figurines and collected in the summary on pp. 342-343) suggest that coroplasts and bronze workers had access to the same body of available models. MOLDING AND MODELING On the basis of previous evidence, it has been thought that Corinth was slow to adopt hollow molding.50 Early Classical hollow-molded figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, however, show clearly that this technique must have been current in Corinth in the early 5th century B.C., the same time as in most other centers. In the stylistically earliest piece that could possibly be called hollow molded, the rider C186, the walls are thick, and the interior opening is regularly cylindrical at about a finger's breadth. Perhaps the piece was mounted on a dowel when it was being finished and the legs were added. Owing to the relatively large scale of this rider, as compared to the ordinary run of Corinthian horse-riders, and the thickness of the walls, the rider may have been fired separately from his horse, explaining the temporary mounting. A more 46 British Museum I, p. 265, no. 971. 47 For lumps of red, yellow, pink, and blue pigment found in the Potters' Quarter, see Corinth XV ii, pp. 6-7.

Several different methods of filling the molds with clay were employed. Overlapping horizon- tal strips of clay were sometimes applied to the mold, and when not smoothed over they can still be seen, as in the interior of the male figurine H309. Sometimes the clay was applied in thin, superimposed layers, which can be seen when the outer surface has broken away, as in H357 and C126. This method sometimes was employed to make the best use of a limited quantity of fine clay, which could be used for the outer surface, backing it with coarser material. This method was more commonly employed for larger objects, such as architectural sculpture. Mold series can be followed most effectively in the abundant and relatively uniform lingering Archaic figurines of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., especially the standing "korai."51 Otherwise, as mentioned previously, the customary heavy retouch makes it difficult to identify mold relationships with certainty. Further, after the Archaic period, Corinthian artisans tended not to alter molds with intaglio before firing,52 preferring instead to create variations on the figurines themselves with retouch and paint. For this reason, parallel molds taken from the same archetype would have been closely similar to one another, and their casts would have been virtually identical. Therefore, the mechanical relationships recorded in the catalogue have been qualified as "probable" or "possible." It was usually not possible to trace a mold series beyond a third generation. A type such as the standing draped female H88-H98, which is known in both large and small scale without all the intermediate sizes, probably is not from an incompletely recovered very long mold series but rather originated from archetypes of widely different scale. In addition to molding, Corinthian coroplasts continued the tradition of modeling figurines by hand after the Archaic period, when handmade horse-riders, standing male and female figures, and grotesques were among the earliest types to be produced. In the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., Archaic handmade types continued in production, in addition to such large handmade pieces as the seated female figure C93, which is purely Classical in style. The technique is found even in the Hellenistic period, to which the head of a statuette H431 belongs. Perhaps the plastic qualities of the local clay encouraged hand modeling; other factors may have been the popularity of terracotta sculpture in Corinth and the use of the same technique in the preparation of models for bronze casting. THE ATTACHMENT OF PARTS Apart from the miniatures, Corinthian figurines tended to be cast in several molds and then assembled. The heads were usually solid or nearly so, the long necks terminating in roughly conical tenons that were inserted between the shoulders. Heads of statuette scale, however, such as H427, might be hollow to diminish their weight. Sometimes, when the interior was well smoothed, the protruding neck tenon was removed, as in C95, but usually it was allowed to remain, as in H202, and would have projected into the open space of the torso. In really poor work, for example, the draped "doll" C184, a head might be just stuck onto a scored surface, probably with a little slip to aid adhesion. In H280, a well-made piece, the hole in the torso to receive the head has a carefully recessed margin, which must have corresponded with cuttings at the base of the neck of the missing head. Separately made arms were usually attached to a flat joining surface, probably with the addition of slip for adhesion, and then smoothed over with a tool like a spatula. In the seated female figurine C82, however, a small hole in the joining surface must have received a tenon at the end of the missing, originally extended forearm. Occasionally, a narrow gap has opened at ajoining surface when the drying clay shrank, but often additions were so carefully concealed that 51 Publication forthcoming; for the type, see Corinth XV, ii, pp. 84-94. 52 On this technique, see Nicholls 1952, pp. 222-223.</page><page sequence="40">16 INTRODUCTION they can be seen clearly only in the layers of clay at breaks. The somewhat different molding and assembly of articulated "dolls" is described below (pp. 50-51). PLASTER MOLDS Plaster molds came into use in Corinth in the Middle Hellenistic period, to judge from the presence of blisters on the surfaces of some figurines, resulting from air bubbles in the surface of the plaster.53 One blistered "doll's" head (C159) was found in an earlier context, the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., but since there is no other evidence for such early use of plaster molds in the sanctuary material, and since the fill contains two later sherds and a known Middle Hellenistic figurine type, the blistered head is considered to be a later intrusion in the lot. Blistered surfaces are most commonly found in the "priestess" type, which probably dates to the last quarter of the 3rd century B.C., for example, H395. There is reason, however, on the basis of other finds in Corinth, to suggest that plaster molds may have come into use sometime in the first half of the 3rd century B.C. The unpublished contents of grave 1929-23, unfortunately disturbed and not certainly from a single burial, include a semidraped male figurine with a blistered surface,54 together with figurines of children belonging stylistically to the first half of the 3rd century, as well as an imported Boeotian seated youth of a type found there in tombs with a terminal date of ca. 250 B.C. (see below, pp. 190, 186). If the blistered figurine was consigned to its burial at the same time as the others, it would share their date. In Corinth, therefore, no matter when in the 3rd century their use began, plaster molds were employed considerably earlier than in Athens, where they are first noted at the end of the 2nd cen- tury B.C.55 It is possible that Corinthian artisans used plaster molds earlier, since there is a tra- dition of their use by Lysistratos, the brother of Lysippos of Sikyon, as recorded by Pliny (JNaturalis Historia 35.153).56 On the other hand, one of the imported figurines from the sanctuary (182) is blistered; since it must date before the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C., it is evident that another, unidentified center also used plaster molds before Athens. Perhaps the evidence from Athens is as yet incomplete, and plaster molds will ultimately prove to have been used there earlier as well. Although plaster molds are more fragile and easily worn than those of terracotta, they have several distinct advantages: the material is uniformly fine textured and hence takes a detailed impression quite well; access to a kiln is not needed because plaster does not require firing; plaster shrinks less than clay in dring, and therefore terhe loss of size in mold series is mitigated. Unlike most terracotta-molded figurines, Corinthian plaster-molded figurines tended to be cast with all parts, including heads and bases, together in one mold; the backs are usually also molded but without full detail. This technique was not necessarily followed in all plaster-molded figurines; the imported 182, for example, shows surface blisters but was constructed in parts and assembled, the usual practice for figurines made from terracotta molds. The Corinthian plaster-molded figurines tend to be thin-walled, although the blistered but thick-walled head of a "priestess" (H404) is an exception. Plaster-molded figurines also tend to have somewhat blurred modeling, perhaps because plaster molds became worn more quickly than terracotta. They frequently have little or no retouch, perhaps because their thin walls were too fragile for much handling before firing. That is not to say that every blurred or unretouched figurine was plaster molded, since these conditions are found even in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., for example, in the standing "korai," for which terracotta molds were found in the Potters' Quarter.57 A Corinthian figurine with a combination of thin walls, blurring, and little or no retouch, however, 53 On plaster molds, see Tarsus I, pp. 298-300; Agora VI, p. 3; Kabirenheiligtum V, p. 8; Bookidis and Fisher 1972, pp. 316-317, note 37; D.

In such cases, obvious blisters may have been removed from the figurines, or the air bubbles in the molds were patched. If this is true, the number of potentially plaster-molded figurines increases greatly. Since this question must be pursued employing the whole of the Corinthian production, not only the figurines from the sanctuary, in this study only figurines with blistered surfaces are considered plaster molded. One thing is clear: the artisans who made these figurines needed fewer skills, since they did not have to piece the heads and limbs, retouch the surfaces, or model the backs by hand. TOOLS Toons Corinthian figurines were often heavily reworked with added elements as well as tooling on both the original surfaces and the added portions of clay. Marks on the surface of the clay sometimes point to the use of particular tools. The principal tool, which appears to have had a small, sharp edge, probably was a metal blade. Its main purpose was to emphasize the molded drapery folds or mark new ones, and most especially to touch up the hair, which often was augmented with added clay. Unfortunately, the tooling was not always done carefully, and some otherwise well made figurines were spoiled by a slashing hand, although some of these deep cuts may have been filled in by the layers of white slip and paint. For examples of such tooling on drapery, see H102; on hair, see C150. A fine-toothed tool was used for paring; its marks are visible over much of the surface of the standing draped female H65 and on the nape of the female head C132. A small, narrow tool with a flat edge like that of a chisel also may have been used to reduce and smooth the surface, as on the back of H264. A pointed tool, probably a very small wooden or metal punch, also was used, especially on facial features and sometimes also on the hair. For example, there are punch marks at the corners of the mouth and on the chin of H183; the hair and wreath of the child's head H347 were delicately punched. There are three examples of C-shaped marks on hair, on C95-C97, which may have come from a small, broken or open-edged reed used in one workshop as a punch. As mentioned above, a tool like a spatula may have been used for smoothing the surface over joins. BACKS AND VENTING The backs of Corinthian figurines were more often handmade than moldmade, the latter being more common in the Hellenistic period. Moldmade backs were often less detailed than the fronts of figurines; therefore, a plain moldmade back distorted by handling could be mistaken for handmade. Similarly, the moldmade back of a head might be obscured by heavy retouch on the hair. Somewhat more detailed moldmade backs including elements of the costume or hair can be found, especially in two popular types, the Early Hellenistic votary carrying a piglet (e.g., HI), and the Middle Hellenistic "priestess" (e.g., H395). Handmade backs of the Classical and Hellenistic periods usually have some contour, although they are more often somewhat flattened than fully rounded. A few 5th-century B.C. figurines are essentially backless, for example, two peplos-figurines (C5 and a mold relative of C3 [see catalogue]) and the banqueter C215; these figurines terminate at the back in a narrow rim around the edges. This treatment is rather unusual in Corinth and may have been copied from Tarentine figurines (see p. 26). In nearly all cases, the join between front and back was well smoothed and hidden; some Roman pieces (e.g., R19) are exceptions. Occasionally, as in the poorly made articulated "doll" C184, the molding margin around the join was not even trimmed away. Methods of venting are varied, even when figurines seem on other grounds to have been made in the same workshop. For example, the Early Classical peplos-figurines C1-C6 and their mold relatives are very close in style, fabric, and technique and have mold relationships among them; they were probably made in the same workshop (Workshop D, page 345), yet there are</page><page sequence="42">18 INTRODUCTION three distinctly different arrangements for controlling the flow of heat. C1 has no vent in back but is open underneath; presumably the base was attached after firing. The two completely backless examples have been mentioned above. Two others (C2 and C6) show the remains of large, rectangular vents, which are the most common form of venting for 5th-century B.C. figurines from other centers.58 The back of C33, which was made in the Potters' Quarter in the 4th century B.C., shows a small rectangular vent (P1. 4). Round vents appear in the Early Hellenistic period (e.g., in the votary H2) or oval vents (e.g., in H10), but rectangular vents are cut at the same time (e.g., H3), although they are generally smaller than the Classical examples. The vent of the 4th-century B.C. female figurine C36 is oval at one side, rectangular at the other. When there was no vent at the back, and the base was added before firing, thereby closing off air circulation from below, a vent was sometimes cut into the underside of the base, as in H1 18 and V39. For solid or very thick-walled figurines, a "pencil-hole" or other opening was sometimes burrowed into the thickest part of the figurine (see H287 and H132). Very small solid figurines, however, were not vented at all, for example, the mantled dancer H165. THE EFFECT OF TECHNIQUE ON STYLE What is defined as "style" in a figurine is the outcome not only of the selection and modification of the type but also of the artisan's technique, learned from his predecessors and qualified by the competence of his hands, as well as by the plasticity of the material. Thus, the accidental or deliberate manipulation of the figurines when they were removed from the molds, still in the vulnerable leather-hard condition, resulted in some of the features that contributed to coroplastic style. For example, the eyes of some 4th-century B.C. heads tend to slant downward at the outer corners; this could have happened when the coroplast grasped the still pliable clay at the temples to withdraw the head from the mold. Or, when the artisan added the back mold to the front or attached clay for a handmade back, the naturally downward strokes of his tools to smooth the join could have drawn the eyes downward at the outer corners. Subsequent generations derived from such a figurine would have preserved this feature. Such eyes are, in fact, found especially in the much repeated heads made in the Potters' Quarter workshops (e.g., C163) and are known also in molds found in the Potters' Quarter.59 The degree to which manipulation and additions could change the style of a figurine, and consequently influence our perception of its date, is well illustrated by the two peplos-figurines C42 and C43. A large oval scar on the left hip and thigh marks the mechanical relationship without room for doubt, but the proportions and costume were altered markedly. As a result, the larger of the two, which on mechanical grounds should be earlier, shows more elongated proportions and narrower shoulders, which on purely stylistic grounds might make it seem later. Either manipulation before firing has stretched the figure and caused it to lose width in the shoulders, or the addition of mantle folds around the shoulders of the smaller piece has made them seem wider. Another explanation is that we are dealing with parallel mold series with completely different histories, which both preserve the scar from a flawed archetype. Another effect of technique on what we perceive as style may have been caused by the common practice of joining heads to torsos by inserting the necks into openings between the shoulders and then smoothing the transition by paring, adding clay if necessary. The result could be a disproportionately wide, spreading neck, as in C59. It is also possible that shrinkage during drying, which was greater in the width than in the height of a figurine,60 resulted in narrower proportions from one generation to the next and hence in an appearance of increasing slenderness. When new types were developed, earlier features could be inadvertently incorporated into them through the reuse of surviving workshop materials. For example, an Early Hellenistic type 58 E.g., in London, Higgins 1986, p. 102, fig. 117 right. 59 E.g., KH-36, Corinth XV, i, p. 101, no. 38, pl. 35. 60 D. B. Thompson 1963a, p. 304.</page><page sequence="43">INTRODUCTION 19 that was new in the later 4th century B.C., the votary Hi, shows a facial type with a characteristic profile, in which the forehead slopes back from an arched nose and the chin recedes (P1. 24). While the head type as a whole is convincingly Hellenistic, nevertheless it recalls similar profiles in Archaic heads,61 suggesting that when the archetype for the new head was constructed, the artisan made use of an earlier archetype, reworking an older design rather than starting completely from scratch. THE DEFINITION OF QUALITY IN FIGURINES What constitutes a well-made figurine? Ideally, the components are a well-designed archetype, carefully prepared and well-fired clay, and skillful assembly, retouch, and painting. In reality, however, among the Corinthian figurines there is no particular formula for quality. The industry was large, and apart from the long-lived workshops of the Potters' Quarter, it was not really well controlled. That is, there appear to have been numerous short-lived workshops taking economic advantage of periodic festivals at which they could sell votives.62 Consequently, although taken as a whole, the general level of quality is high, there is much inconsistency. Larger figurines are likely to have been relatively expensive, but poor workmanship might accompany large size, as in H196 and H197. Excellent fabric might be combined with clumsy retouch, as in the head H223. A figurine might be smoothly polished on the surface but at the same time might be thick-walled and carelessly finished inside, as in the dancer H153. A well-designed and otherwise decently made figurine might have a back mold belonging to a different type, as in the votary H1. On the whole, the areas of highest quality in the Corinthian industry, from the artisanal point of view, were in archetype design and clay preparation; the poor fabrics of the 3rd century B.C. (see p. 12) stand out as unusual and probably resulted from special circumstances. Retouch was often clumsy and was the weakest aspect of workmanship, although there are a few examples of exceptionally fine retouch. Little paint is preserved, but the use of gilding, enamel-like ivory and subtle pink shades for flesh, and a distinctive bright blue paint (see pp. 13-14) show interest and professionalism in that area of coroplasty. Perhaps panel painters contributed some expertise here. In spite of frequent lapses in one respect or another, Corinthian figurines have earned comparison with the best sculpture in quality;63 this is true particularly of some of the sanctuary figurines of the Archaic period and the 4th century B.C. THE CORINTHIAN COROPLASTIC INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE A thumbnail sketch of the history of the coroplastic industry in Corinth may help to explain the complexities of the local production. The following paragraphs summarize some of the conclusions of an article now in press.64 The earliest Archaic production documented so far within the city of Corinth dates to the last quarter of the 7th century B.C., when the workshops of the Potters' Quarter added figurines to their output of pottery and terracotta reliefs. There is so far no physical proof in the form of molds or parallel figurine types that the earlier-7th-century Dedalic figurines found at Perachora and elsewhere in the region were actually made in Corinth, although they appear to have been made of Corinthian clay (i.e., clay that is visually identical to that used later in Corinth). The large quantities of widely exported lingering Archaic stock types for which the Potters' Quarter is best known (see p. 23, note 1) were not made before the early 5th century B.C. Although the Potters' Quarter workshops continued to turn out figurines in a generally conservative style until they ceased production in or near the 320s B.C., other workshops, often staffed by better artisans, concurrently manufactured figurines in a more forward-looking 61 E.g., Wallenstein 1971, p. 130, no. V/A3, pl. 13:3; MF- 12016 from the sanctuary, publication forthcoming. 62 Merker, forthcoming. 63 Rolley 1986, p. 100; on quality in figurines, see Thasos XVII, pp. 42-43. 64 Merker, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="44">20 INTRODUCTION style. The precise locations of these workshops are not known, but the urban organization of Corinth, which consisted of scattered settlements located around water sources and roads with agricultural fields between them (see p. 31), encouraged a dispersed industrial pattern. A lack of physical connection between workshops may have caused, at least in part, the diversity of types and styles within the city. Relatively few figurines have been found in graves in Corinth. Their principal function apparently was votive, and just as the pattern of production was dispersed, distribution also may have been; figurines may not have been sold at a central market, but instead appropriate types may have been sold at the numerous shrines scattered through the city. The dependence of the industry upon cultic use, and consequently on the calendric rhythm of those festivals that used figurines, may explain why, except for the Potter's Quarter, which was in part supported by its exports, workshops seem to have been short lived. That is, one finds small related groupings of figurines, as if coroplasty were a part-time pursuit, undertaken when an opportunity approached for the sale of figurines. Perhaps there were few or no fully "professional" coroplasts, and potters or other artisans conversant with the handling and firing of clay undertook coroplasty when it was economically feasible. The possibility that the craft depended upon model making for small bronzes to provide archetypes for the figurines is discussed above (p. 14). USING THE CATALOGUE OF FIGURINES Because the total of catalogue listings of figurines in this volume approaches 900 items, certain conventions have been adopted to streamline the entries. Catalogue numbers preceded by the letter "C" are Classical or Classical survivals; "H" are Hellenistic or Hellenistic survivals; "V" are Varia; "I" are imports; "R" are Roman. The catalogue entries are confined to technical information and lists of closely related figurines. Discussions of style, iconography, and chronology may be found through the page references at the close of each catalogue entry. Each catalogue entry provides the following information: Lot numbers: To avoid repetition, the context date of the lot is not given in each catalogue entry but in the cumulative list on pages 353-368. Size numbers: To help the reader visualize the original size of a fragmentary figurine, a range of five numbered sizes has been provided, as described on pages 9-10. Two numbers separated by a dash indicate that the approximate height of the original figurine overlaps two size ranges. The size range of a seated figurine is determined as if it were standing. Size ranges are not provided for miscellaneous types, such as plaques. Fabric numbers: Numbered fabrics are described on pages 11-12. Fabrics are fully described in the catalogue only if they do not fall within any of the numbered categories. When mold siblings, earlier or later generations, or similar figurines, are listed in a catalogue entry, a fabric number is given only if the fabric differs from that of the catalogued figurine. Colors: For descriptions of colors and their Munsell and C.E.C. equivalents, see pages 12-13. When two colors are named, the predominant color is mentioned first; for example, a figurine that is "orange-buff to orange" shows orange-buff over a larger area of the surface than orange. Reference is made to chart numbers only when the color of a figurine does not quite match any of the standard descriptions. Moldmade and handmade: Figurines are moldmade, unless otherwise stated. Hollow and solid: Heads and torsos preserved separately are described as hollow or solid. When a figurine preserves both the head and torso, it may be impossible to determine whether the head is solid or hollow, if a solid neck obscures the view of the interior. If the head was molded separately, it is likely that it is solid or nearly so, even if the torso is hollow,</page><page sequence="45">INTRODUCTION 21 since this technique was commonly employed. Isolated heads with solid necks are assumed to be solid if they are heavy. Thickness of walls: Walls are described as thin or thick only if they depart significantly from the average, as described under fabrics on pages 11-12. Treatment of backs: Backs of figurines are described as rounded (fully contoured), flat (perfectly flat), or flattened (diminished in depth but with contours indicated). Backs have few or no details, unless otherwise specified. If venting is not mentioned, no information is preserved. Treatment of undersurfaces: Hollow figurines are open underneath, unless otherwise described. Additions: Features added to the figurine after it was removed from the mold, such as drapery, jewelry, and hair, are listed. Since heads and extended arms were customarily made separately and attached to the torsos, they are not included among the additions unless the attachment is in some way unusual. When the head and torso were rendered in the same mold, it is so stated. The description "all parts rendered in same mold" means that the mold includes all anatomical features, as well as the base and attributes. Tooling: When the surfaces of figurines are worn, it is not always clear whether details were molded or were cut into the unfired clay after removal from the mold. For each figurine, the areas are listed in which tooling is fairly obvious. Figurine descriptions: Figurines are frontal in pose, unless otherwise described. The words right and left refer to the figurine's proper right and left, unless viewer's directions are specifically indicated. When the directions are seen from the viewer's perspective, it is so stated. In descriptions of faces, the predominant shape is given first; for example, a face that is "oval to round" is more oval than round in shape. The description "dull impression" refers to figurines in which the outlines of facial features, drapery, and attributes are blurred. The cause of the blurring is not specified, since such figurines could have been made from later generation molds that were not retouched or from molds that were worn from use, or they could themselves have been worn down during burial. For drapery descriptions, the terminology in Ridgway 1981a, pp. xvii-xix, is employed. Mold siblings and other related figurines: At the end of each catalogue description, figurines are listed that are either mechanically related or similar in type. Many of these are too poorly preserved to warrant more extensive treatment or illustration. Those from the Demeter sanctuary are referred to by Corinth Archaeological Museum inventory numbers if they were inventoried; if they were not inventoried, the number of the associated pottery lot is provided. If the fabric differs from that of the catalogued figurine, a fabric number is provided. Figurines found elsewhere in Corinth are given their source if they were found in a clearly definable site, such as the South Stoa. The term "Corinth collection" is used for figurines from more scattered locations. Such lists are omitted for the very prevalent articulated "dolls"; in this case, only the total quantity found has been provided (p. 3). In light of the problems encountered in determining the mold relationships of Corinthian figurines (see pp. 4, 15), some caution has been exercised in listing relatives. "Probable" mold siblings are the most likely candidates, while "possible" siblings are less certain. Similarly, gen- erations may be referred to as "earlier" or "later," rather than numbered (e.g., first generation, second generation). When figurines are listed merely as "mechanically related," the nature of the relationship cannot be determined satisfactorily. Figurines that are "similar in type" are probably not mechanical relatives. Figurines in museum collections: Apart from Corinthian exports that were found in other excavations and are preserved in museums, a good many of the Corinthian figurines in collections were looted from tombs in the vicinity of Corinth during the 19th century. Such figurines, without archaeological context, are of limited value for the purposes of this study. Therefore, figurines</page><page sequence="46">22 INTRODUCTION from museums other than the Corinth Archaeological Museum are recorded only if they complete or help to clarify the composition of a poorly preserved type, provide chronological information, or demonstrate noteworthy variations. Otherwise, no attempt has been made to collect parallels in museums for the sake of collecting them.

One of the older elements consisted of figurines of lingering Archaic style that were newly created in the early 5th century B.C. but without any concession to new ideas. These types, including standing "korai," seated goddesses, spoon-based protomes, chitoniskos "dolls," and sphinx, rooster, and Gorgon plaques, were made in the Potters' Quarter and were popular locally as well as widely exported. 1 These figurines, which may have continued in production even into the 4th century B.C., were produced beside other types that really were of Archaic origin but continued to be turned out in the workshops as before, retaining their essential form. Handmade animals and horse-riders especially fall into this category. Beside these two kinds of survivals, entirely new types were created, beginning in the earlier part of the 5th century B.C.; a good example is the peplos-figurine C1, which includes new stylistic features also found in Severe-style sculpture. In addition to these altogether new creations, some types inherited from the Archaic period were partially updated in the new, Classical style. For example, the seated goddess type reconstructed from the fragments C71-C73 would be thought Archaic but for the Classical face. Thus the coroplastic workshops of the 5th and early 4th cen- turies B.C. took three different, although concurrent approaches: maintaining or imitating earlier types or style; introducing entirely new ideas; and adapting old types to fit new conceptions of style. As time went on, by the second quarter or, at the very latest, the middle of the 4th century B.C., further changes are apparent, but once again, figurines of new types and style do not replace but are produced concurrently with those retaining the Classical forms. This chapter, therefore, deals with part of the complex production of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. by treating Classical figurines together with their survivals into the Early Hellenistic period. The innovations of the 4th century B.C. form a continuum with what follows and are therefore treated in the next chapter as Early Hellenistic figurines, although some are earlier than the conventional beginning of the Hellenistic period ca. 330 B.C. If it seems strange that Archaic, Classical, and Early Hellenistic styles overlap so thoroughly during the 4th century B.C., the causes of this phenomenon should be sought in the votive character of the material, which tended to prolong the use of types once they were established in the ritual, and also in the character of the Corinthian coroplastic industry as a whole, which was home to workshops varying widely in skills and sources of inspiration.2 Although the workshops of the Potters' Quarter were still active through the 5th century B.C. and well into the 4th, other workshops came into existence that infused new life into the Corinthian coroplastic tradition through the greater originality and skill of their artisans.3 In some cases, technical similarities among figurines point to workshop connections and help to define the 1 Examples of these types found in the Acrocorinth sanc- tuary will be published in a forthcoming fascicle of Cor- inth XVIII. For previously published examples of the types, see Corinth XV, ii, pp. 84-94, pls. 14-17 (standing "korai"); pp. 94-97, pl. 17 (seated goddesses); pp. 97-101, pls. 18, 19 (spoon-based protomes); pp. 154-163, pl. 33 (plaques); Cor- inth XII, p. 33, no. 130, pl. 9 (chitoniskos "doll"). 2 On the industry as a whole, see Merker, forthcoming, and pp. 19-20. 3 On the existence of sites in Corinth, apart from the Potters' Quarter, in which figurines could have been made, see Davidson 1942, p. 110; Corinth XII, pp. 17, 19-22 (on finds of try pieces, wasters, and molds); Stroud 1965, p. 17; Benson 1984.</page><page sequence="48">24 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS interests and skills of different groups of artisans. The workshop connections mentioned as the discussion progresses are summarized on pages 344-346. STANDING DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES (C1-C44) PEPLOS-FIGURINES As a general type, standing peplos-figurines are notable among the figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary for their quantity, longevity, and the numerous variations in the arrangement of the peplos and the style of drapery. Under this heading, figurines with four different peplos arrangements are discussed: (1) with a short overfold; (2) with a long overfold, unbelted; (3) with a long overfold, belted (the so-called peplos of Athena); (4) with a kolpos and overfold. There are variants within all these groups, and each apparently was derived from a different archetype, probably in a different workshop. The history of these groups is very complex and full of gaps, but it would appear that the figurines reflect developments in stone sculpture and small bronzes. 1. Peplos-figurines with short overfold (Cl-C12). A break with Archaic tradition is first seen in moldmade peplos-figurines of Early Classical style, which probably represent female votaries (C 1-C6). Some carry a piglet, a bird, or both, or a ball; all are larger figurines or statuettes (size range 3 or 4). Although these figurines continue in type the long Corinthian Archaic tradition of wholly or partially handmade standing female figurines wearing the peplos, stylistically and technically they stand at the beginning of another long tradition of moldmade figurines lasting into the Early Hellenistic period. The departure from tradition is found not only in style but also in subject, since the Corinthian coroplasts of the Archaic period tended to emphasize representations of deities rather than worshipers, while their Classical descendants seem to have turned in part to mortal subjects. The difficulty in distinguishing god from mortal is well known,4 particularly in the absence of characteristic attributes, costumes, or headdresses. Moreover, it is not always clear whether an object in the hand, such as a bird or piglet, is a divine attribute, a votary's gift about to be offered, or a gift already received by the deity. Similarities of costume and pose among deities, votaries, and cult attendants confuse the issue, suggesting a purposeful blurring of the boundaries between them, perhaps to establish a measure of identity between deities and their worshipers. A mortal may even impersonate a deity in cult ritual.5 One type new to this period, however, the hydriaphoros, must represent a votary, since the carrying of water was considered a lowly task, unlikely to be assigned to a goddess,6 and the carrying of water by votaries in religious processions is well documented.7 Perhaps hydriaphoroi were particularly suitable to this sanctuary because the most copious source of fresh water in the vicinity lies at the fountain of Hadji Mustafa, ca. 200-300 m below the sanctuary.8 Moreover, there is a notable scarcity among the Classical figurines of heads wearing the polos, which was the typical headdress of the Corinthian Archaic standing and seated goddesses;9 only the more traditional seated goddesses, such as C71, still wear the polos. 10 Without incontrovertible signs of divinity, the Classical standing peplos-figurines 4 On this subject, see Zuntz 1971, pp. 91-97, 272; Con- nelly 1988, pp. 21-22; Thasos XVII, pp. 472-480. 5 Troy, p. 90, citing the worship at Ephesos of a mortal costumed as Artemis. 6 See Euripides, Electra, lines 54-76; Electra's peasant husband takes on the task of carrying water for her because of her royal birth. On the usually low social status of water carriers in vase painting, see Hannestad 1984, with bibliography; during festivals this social distinction seems to have been dropped. 7 Diehl 1964, pp. 171-173. 8 Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 14-15. 9 On the polos, see Morgantina, pp. 81-82, with bibliography. 10 The head with polos C104 could have belonged to a standing figurine, but it is a copy of an Attic type rather than a local creation (see p. 48).</page><page sequence="49">DISCUSSION 25 are best considered votaries, unless they share distinctive drapery arrangements with sculptures known to represent goddesses. The drapery style of this small group is generally consistent with Peloponnesian monumental sculpture of the Severe period, but the typical, geometrically constructed peplos with overfold to the waist is worn by figurines in an essentially Archaic pose, with arms pressed closely against the torso and one leg stepping forward rigidly, with stiff knee, as in C1. The plastic, rather doughy rendering of the folds and the vertical pleats framing the overfold, dipping in zigzags diagonally to the hips at either side, invite comparison with, for example, the Athena of the Apples of the Hesperides metope from the Temple of Zeus at Olympia."1 In the overall design of both, the rectangular shapes of the peplos hide the rounded forms of the feminine figure, and plasticity is stressed over detail. In both, the almost vertical skirt folds, accented with vertical grooves especially on the thigh, are comparable, as are the broad shoulders, their outlines softened and rounded by folds appearing from behind. Also similar is the use of bunches of folds to offset the smooth surfaces. The drapery is simpler in the figurines, however, in that the overfold does not have catenaries between the breasts or long omega folds depending from them. The kolpos, which may or may not appear in the sculpture, usually was omitted by the coroplasts. A more Archaic feature is the flat, boat-shaped neckline, which does not show the pleat of loose cloth on the chest that appears in the Olympia sculpture; a better comparison for this feature is the neckline of the so-called Peplos Kore from the Athenian Akropolis, dated ca. 530 B.C.'2 The figurines also may clutch offerings to the chest in the Archaic manner. A similar fusion of Archaic and Classical style can be seen in the rider figurine C186; the horizontally grooved hair of this piece is stylistically earlier than its already 5th-century B.C. drapery. A reasonable stylistic date for the archetypes of this figurine group would be not later than the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. and possibly earlier. Although three of the group (Cl, C4, C5) are associated with Archaic to 5th-century B.C. pottery lots, none can be dated more closely through context. Since no members of this group were found in the Potters' Quarter excavations, they were probably made elsewhere in the city. There is enough stylistic and technical coherence among C1-C6 to suggest that they were made in the same workshop (Workshop D, p. 345). Although other mechanically connected fragments are noted in the catalogue, there is no evidence that any of these figurines gave rise to an extended mold series; in fact, it is not possible to identify even a second generation among the preserved figurines, implying that this workshop either was short-lived or turned to other work. Another possible member of this workshop group is the horse-rider C186. None of the peplos-figurines of this group preserves the head, but the absence of locks of hair on the shoulders of C1 indicates that the hair was short or bound high on the head. Evidence for the head type may be found in a probably Corinthian figurine from the cave at Pitsa, which wears a similar peplos with plastically rendered folds, although with a kolpos.13 The mouth and nose were badly distorted in molding, but the head is similar, in its long, narrow shape and large features, to the heads of Early Classical hydriaphoroi discussed below (e.g., C55) and to the related heads without clear traces of a hydria or other object, which could have belonged to simple peplos-figurines. The hair of the figurine from Pitsa is arranged in thick strands rolled back from the forehead over a fillet, as in C61, which must be somewhat later, however, on the basis of its more developed features. Among the isolated female heads of the period, C102 also could have belonged to a peplos-figurine. 1 Conveniently, Ashmole and Yalouris 1967, fig. 188. 12 Richter 1968, p. 72, no. 113, fig. 351. 3 EAA VI, 1965, p. 205, fig. 227, s.v. Pitsa (A. K. Orlandos).</page><page sequence="50">26 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS Figurines from the Argolid14 and Sicily15 are comparable to this Corinthian group in proportions, pose, and drapery style; the Argive import II is a good example. A similar figurine was found at Lindos.16 A step further away are the Athenian standing peplos-figurines, which are similar to the Corinthian in the peplos arrangement but seem stylistically later, with more slender proportions, lighter modeling, and a freer leg position.17 The Athenian type seems to have been exported widely and influenced production elsewhere, for example, Boeotia,18 but differences in style suggest that the Athenian peplos-figurines and their imitations formed a group separate from the Sicilian and Peloponnesian figurines.19 It is possible that the distinctive style of the latter was influenced by artisans who had worked at Olympia, perhaps participating in the creation of small-scale clay models for the temple sculptures.20 A study of the Olympia Master suggests that northeast Peloponnesian artisans took part in the Olympia project.21 There are other connections with West Greek figurines apart from style. A probable technical influence can be found in the backless construction of C5 and a mold relative of C3 (see catalogue). This technique is found also among the banqueters (C215) and is characteristic of Tarentine figurines.22 In this period, however, Corinthian artisans more commonly made backs with a large rectangular vent, as in C2, or without a vent but open underneath, as in C1. The piglet carrier provides a typological connection with the West, since the female figurine type holding a piglet, representing either a votary or Persephone, was a Late Archaic Sicilian invention.23 While most of the Sicilian examples hold the piglet in both hands across the torso, some carry it at the side, grasping the back legs. A peplos-figurine from Syracuse holds the animal diagonally across the thigh, as in C1.24 The earliest Sicilian pig-carrying types, wearing chiton and mantle rather than the peplos, seem not to have affected Corinthian production, the influence first appearing in the Severe period, as is the case also with Tarentine influence on the banqueter type (see p. 66). In dealing with Early Classical peplos-figurines, the large body of bronze caryatid mirror stands and statuettes should be mentioned;25 a connection with this class of mirrors may be proposed for the lingering Archaic standing "korai" as well. The preparation of a wax working model, cast from master molds taken from an original "artist's model," probably made of clay, was a necessary preliminary step in the manufacture of bronzes by the indirect casting method.26 The models for such bronzes could have been made by the same artisans who prepared archetypes for coroplasts, or perhaps metalworkers and coroplasts shared the very same workshop materials. The connection between terracotta and bronze manufacture has long been recognized. For 14 Cf. Tiryns I, pp. 74-75, no. 80, pl. IX:7; p. 81, no. 128, pl.

Caryatid mirrors are known to have been made in Corinth, although only a few of the char- acteristic animal attachments have been found in excavations in Corinth itself.29 The problems in the attribution of bronzes and the web of conflicting attributions are nearly impenetrable, but a few connections of Early Classical Corinthian figurines with bronzes can be suggested. The mirror caryatids are usually smaller in scale, freer in movement, more slender in proportions, and more elegant in general appearance than the figurines. One may cite, however, a caryatid in Geneva which, although freer in pose and somewhat later in date, has a doughy plasticity in the folds recalling the figurines, as well as a narrow, large-featured face comparable to the common Early Classical Corinthian type discussed below (pp. 39-40).30 It would not be difficult to imagine a shared inspiration in this case. Alternatively, molds for figurines could have been taken mechanically from bronzes. If any figurine from the Demeter sanctuary was copied from a mirror caryatid or similar bronze figure in this way, the best candidate would be C9. This piece is of a suitable scale, pose, and drapery style, and the clumsily added arm and mitten-shaped hand, different in position from the arms of all the other peplos-figurines, could be an attempted copy of a mirror caryatid's bent arm, although the motif of the hand pulling aside the skirt has not been carried through. A similar mitten-shaped hand in this pose, with the pulled skirt folds barely rendered, can be found in a very small bronze figure, thought to be of Peloponnesian origin, in Providence.31 The thick-walled construction of C9 is very different from the earliest group of peplos-figurines discussed above, and its freer pose and more fluid drapery are of more advanced stylistic date, perhaps the middle to third quarter of the 5th century B.C. It may be of interest in this regard to mention a fragmentary mold found in the Tile Works in Corinth, showing the lower part of a 5th-century B.C. peplos-figurine; as far as it is preserved, this piece matches mirror caryatids in type and scale and could have been taken from a bronze of this kind.32 The fragmentary figurines C7 and C8, taken together, represent the upper and lower parts of a more developed type of peplos-figurine with short overfold. The rigid horizontal line of the hem at the waist remains, but the zigzag folds down the open side of the peplos are more fluid, ending in a characteristic pointed fold at the thigh; clusters of narrow skirt folds frame both legs, and the hem trails somewhat. The same fold pattern is found in a complete figurine of unknown provenience in Paris,33 which appears to have a mechanical relationship with C7 and C8 and may well be Corinthian; it has been adapted to carry fruit or flowers in the lifted overfold. The head of the figurine in Paris also is related in facial type to a Corinthian head from the sanctuary (C149).

Winter, Typen I, p. 78, no. 2, a related Corinthian type.</page><page sequence="52">28 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS may also have a workshop connection with C7 and C8.34 The fragmentary votary with flowers H28 is similar in scale and workmanship to C7 and C8, and could have been made in the same workshop, but is discussed below (pp. 124-125) with Early Hellenistic votary figurines on account of the offerings it carries; too little of this figurine is preserved to determine its type. Another fragment similar in type to this group, in lot 6508, seems to have raised the right arm high and therefore may have been used as a hydriaphoros. Although the missing right arm of C7 originally was raised, the angle does not seem to be sharp enough for a hydriaphoros, and the original pose remains uncertain; perhaps the hand touched the shoulder. The molding of the legs as if nude, framed by clusters of folds, suggests that C8 should be dated stylistically not earlier than the late 5th century B.C., based on developments in sculpture. This manner of revealing both legs is found also in the peplos-figurine type with a long overfold (e.g., C16), discussed below. It is likely that C7 and C8 actually were made in the 4th century B.C. A fragment mechanically related to C8 (see catalogue) was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The most debased and smallest (size range 2) versions of the peplos-figurine type with short overfold are C10-C12; these figurines probably date to the 4th century B.C. and can be attributed to a Potters' Quarter workshop on the basis of the fabric, concave back, and small plaque base, in which respects they are very like the lingering Archaic standing "korai" made there.35 C10 can be connected in pose and costume, and in the use of broken catenaries to show folds across the center of the overfold, with a small bronze figure in Boston of reported Corinthian provenience, showing a girl holding a bowl of cakes and fruit.36 C10 also can be compared to terracotta peplos-figurines from Tiryns, which are similar in scale, the form of the base, and the shape of the overfold hem.37 C12 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., as are two mold siblings of Cll (see catalogue). The elongated proportions and sloping shoulders of C12 suggest that this figurine stands near the end of the series. The only example with its head preserved (Cl 1 shows a face recalling, in its rounded shape, delicate features, and gentle expression, the faces of later 5th-century B.C. Attic sculpture.38 The narrow chin and relatively broad forehead of Cl1, however, bring one back again to the triangular faces of the lingering Archaic "korai" made at the Potters' Quarter. Although these latest members of the group are typologically similar to the earlier C1, a mechanical relationship between the two cannot be traced. The archaeological record may be incomplete, but it is more likely that a type created by artisans outside the Potters' Quarter was adopted only very slowly, and in a derivative form, by the more conservative workshops within the Potters' Quarter. A similar phenomenon can be seen in the following peplos-figurine group as well. The rather backward nature of this segment of the Corinthian coroplastic industry has already been noted.39 34 Two very similar to one another, with fruit in a bowl rather than the lifted overfold, and furnished with wings as Nikai: Bomford Collection, pp. 44-45, no. 117 (= Nicholson 1968, p. 20, no. 52, pl. 36), and Hutton 1899, cols. 31-32, fig. 4 (= Winter, Typen II, p. 179, no. 2, in Athens, from Ere- tria). Another, not winged, with a bowl of fruit: von Stack- elberg 1837, pl. LXIII right (= Winter, Typen I, p. 78, no. 4). These figurines have been included in the "Maying Group" by Nicholls 1995, p. 425, and assigned to the "Corinthian pe- riphery." The discovery of C7 and C8 in Corinth, as well as several fragmentary mold siblings (see catalogue), should make it possible to assign some members of this group to Corinth itself. Only those figurines mentioned here seem to me to be candidates for Corinthian manufacture. Others on Nicholls' list I would not associate closely, because the head type is not characteristic of Corinth or the drapery arrangement is sig- nificantly different. Since-in these cases the impressions seem rather dull, the figurines may be adaptations made elsewhere using torso molds derived from the original group. 35 Cf., e.g., Corinth XV, ii, pp. 84-94, pls. 14-17. 36 Comstock and Vermeule 1971, pp. 54-55, no. 55. 37 E.g., Tiryns I, p. 75, no. 89, pl.

With their differing drapery arrangements, they must have had entirely different sources, and differences in handling suggest separate workshops as well. The introduction of each new type does not seem to have displaced existing types, since each one was exploited until it virtually wore itself out. 2. Peplos-figurines with long overfold, unbelted (C13-C23). The stylistically earliest version of this type is C13, which still has a distinctly Archaic flavor and seems to be an updated version of lingering Archaic "kore" figurines that carry flowers.40 Yet in spite of the Archaic reminiscence in pose, the neckline folds of the peplos plunge into sharp V-shape, like the garments of the peplophoroi of the east frieze of the Parthenon.41 A transition to a more fully Classical treatment can be found in two statuette fragments of excellent quality (C14 and C15), probably dating in style to the middle to third quarter of the 5th century. They are in size range 4-5, and as often happens, the largest and best-made pieces are the most poorly preserved and hence the least comprehensible. The fabric of C14 shows the addition of the gray, red, and white inclusions characteristic of Corinthian "tile fabric," which also was used for terracotta sculpture.42 Special care seems to have been taken in the preparation of this piece, as it is also fired harder than usual. The preserved folds suggest that the overfold hem was drawn upward towards the left side; this foreshadows a motif seen later in piglet carriers of the Early Hellenistic period (see HI). In another possible reconstruction of the pose, however, the back of the overfold would have been drawn under the bent left elbow and over the head. A marble statuette in Rome takes this pose, with drapery folds similar to the figurine, including the knotted or weighted overfold corner; the statuette is thought to be a copy of a 5th-century B.C. Peloponnesian bronze original.43 C14 has no preserved mechanical relatives, as is also true of C15, which may come from the same workshop. Presumably there was much less demand for these large, finely made, and undoubtedly expensive pieces. It is also possible that their archetypes were related to models created for use in the manufacture of bronze statuettes, and only secondarily were molds taken for reproduction in terracotta. The peplos overfold of C15, falling to the top of the thighs, is of thin, clinging cloth, almost like a chiton; the folds, as far as they are preserved, are narrow, rather calligraphic ridges. The thigh is visible through the thin cloth as if nude. The arrangement of the dress, although not the drapery style, recalls a Corinthian marble peplophoros of the Severe period, in which the long overfold follows the contours of the front of the figure.44 While C15 cannot be followed mechanically into further generations, the peplos-figurine type with a long, clinging overfold, and legs visible through the cloth, reappears in the 4th century B.C. (C16-C18); twenty-four fragmentary examples from this period have been counted in the lots. In spite of small variations in pose, the type is easily recognizable, although the extremely dull impressions make it virtually impossible to follow accurately any mold series. On the basis of their similarly thick-walled construction, C17 and C18 may have been made in the same workshop. Contributing to the lack of plastic detail may be an archetype characterized stylistically by flat, clinging folds, somewhat like those of an Archaic kore. Of all the Classical peplos-figurine types, this one appears to have been the most popular, suggesting that the image it presented was especially important to visitors 4" E.g., MF-1580, Corinth XII, p. 30, no. 94, pl. 6. 41 Robertson and Frantz 1975, pl. 12, East VII:53-56. 42 On this fabric, see Farnsworth 1964, p. 224; Corinth XV, iii, p. 347. On its use in sculpture, see Weinberg 1957, pp. 293- 294. It appears occasionally in figurines, at Isthmia perhaps more often than in Corinth: Mitten 1962 (1963, p. 309). 43 Helbig4 II, p. 320, no. 1504 (Conservatori Museum), with bibliography; a Sikyonian origin has been suggested by Langlotz 1946/1947, p. 108.

Since the long overfold is sometimes associated with younger or unmarried women,45 these figurines probably represent either Kore or youthful votaries. The preserved examples vary in the position of the legs, but the stance is always quiet, one leg or the other slightly advanced, with the weight evenly divided and no contrapposto. A pose similar to that ofC21, with the right leg advanced, is found in a mold of a peplos-figurine from the Potters' Quarter.46 While no examples are preserved with the feet, it is likely that such lower figurine fragments as C19 and C20 belong to this group. These fragments show bare feet, the right foot a little advanced and pointing to the corner of a rectangular base. The ritual participants in Kallimachos' Hymn to Demeter line 125 are barefoot,47 supporting the identification of these figurines as votaries. Perhaps the sandals were divested, along with other ornaments, at the time of ritual, or the bare feet were thought to make more direct contact with the earth as the source of fertility. It should be noted, however, that the seated Demeter or Kore pictured on a Corinthian plate of the Sam Wide group (see p. 43) is also barefoot. The forearms of these figurines were extended, either forward or to the side; one forearm may have been turned slightly inward in some examples. It is not known if anything was held in the hands. The pose belongs altogether to the 5th century B.C., but the proportions, usually slender and sometimes quite elongated, place the figurines in the mid- to later 4th century B.C. The head of C17 is also of 4th-century B.C. type. The face is distinctive, with a broad forehead, tapering chin, features clustered near the center of the face, and eyes turned down at the outer corners. This face is found also among the articulated "dolls," with an altered coiffure. In fact, the head of C17 is probably a mold sibling of the "doll's" head C152; both heads also share a distinctive retouch. They are members of a workshop group (Workshop B) discussed further below (pp. 56, 344-345). This mechanical connection with articulated "dolls," which were made in the Potters' Quarter, suggests that this group of peplos-figurines was made there as well. The head of C 17 is of a type known in molds found there.48 The heavily retouched hair ofC17 contrasts with the torso, which lacks retouch, although the impression is very dull; similarly, all the hand tooling of the "dolls" was lavished on the heads. The walls of the figurines of this group are unusually thick; perhaps they were made this way to ensure uniform firing, if they were baked together with articulated "dolls," the torsos of which are nearly solid. If the connection of these figurines with the Potters' Quarter is correct, their production would have ceased with the closing of the workshops there in the later 4th century B.C. Since a direct link is lacking in this group with an expected 5th-century B.C. forerunner such as C15, we may have another example here, as in the case of C10 and C11, of a sort of delayed reaction in the Potters' Quarter workshops, whereby a type created during the 5th century B.C. elsewhere in Corinth was not reflected in the Potters' Quarter production, which tended to be quite conservative, until some time later. It is worth considering at this point possible reasons for such discrepancies in the coroplastic production of one city Some workshops were still producing, in the 4th century B.C., such lingering Archaic figurines as the standing "korai," which were widely exported and have been found in such numbers that they have, unfortunately, almost become synonymous with Corinthian figurines. Although the clay was well prepared and these figurines usually were well fired, they were rarely retouched and were made in a single mold with the least possible attention to the back. It is unclear whether the artisans were motivated by a lucrative demand for the most familiar votive types, had no creative ambitions whatsoever, or were primarily potters who made figurines for festivals as a sideline,49 but once a successful formula evolved, it appears to have been exploited 45 Bieber 1928, pp. 37-38, pl. V:2; Bieber 1934, p. 33, pl. 18:1. 46 KH-87, Corinth XV, i, p. 96, no. 25, pl. 33. 47 Hopkinson 1984, pp. 39-41. 48 E.g., KH-35, Corinth XV, i, p. 101, no. 37, pl. 34. 49 On the identity of potter and coroplast in the Potters' Quarter, see Corinth XV, ii, pp. 3-4; on the seasonal nature of the coroplastic industry, see Merker, forthcoming, and p. 20.</page><page sequence="55">DISCUSSION 31 in the extensive market, at home and abroad, for small cheap figurines to be used as grave gifts and dedications in cults of different kinds. The accumulation of Corinthian lingering Archaic "stock" types (standing "korai," seated goddesses, sphinx and rooster plaques) excavated in the Corycian cave at Delphi is revealing; more than five hundred examples have been illustrated in group photographs, most probably multiples from a few molds, indicating a substantial trade in these items that was much more than casual.50 The same point has been made for Corinthian "korai" from Cyrene.51 More substantial artistic achievements, left to other workshops, were apparently reproduced in smaller quantities and were appreciated and sold chiefly at home. In the terminology of the late-20th-century marketplace, one almost might speak of "mass-market" as opposed to "limited edition" figurines. While some workshops may have come and gone, the ones producing time-honored types continued to find markets for at least a century. Salmon has suggested that the commercial success of Archaic Corinthian pottery owed much to the strong organization of the Potters' Quarter industry.52 If this is true, the mechanisms developed for the trade in Archaic pottery may have continued to serve in the 5th century B.C., when the export of pottery declined, for the trade in Potters' Quarter figurines, which are comparable to the pottery in the large number produced, the repetition of types, and the eye-catching design and color. It must be mentioned, however, that the identification of the so-called Long Buildings just inside the city wall as a kind of market area of shops or booths for the sale of pottery, on which Salmon's argument rests, has been questioned.53 The coroplasts of the Potters' Quarter do seem to have had a monopoly of the trade in Corinthian figurines, and therefore they probably had some control of the mechanisms of trade, but so far only the nature of the product provides an explanation. A further reason for the stylistic and technical discrepancies among the products of Corinthian workshops may have been the unusual urban organization of ancient Corinth. From the Geometric period onward, areas of habitation developed around different water sources and roads. When the city wall was built, it encompassed these villages, still separated by agricultural fields and cemeteries, within its very spacious boundaries; the Potters' Quarter was one of these areas.54 While the physical distance certainly would not have prevented contact between the settlements, the distance of custom and psychology could have been sufficient to separate the Potters' Quarter industry from the workshops of other areas,55 which were more outward-oriented and up-to-date in artistic outlook, and perhaps shared workshop materials with artisans in other crafts. Separation did not mean failure, however, because the Potters' Quarter workshops thrived as long as they were able to sell their products at home and abroad, and only a natural disaster, or perhaps a change in the extent of the city walls, brought their production to an end. The role of social factors also might be considered. If Salmon's reconstruction of a general Corinthian social stability is correct,56 conservatism in some workshops could have been en- couraged by the peaceful, uninterrupted passing of coroplastic traditions from one generation to the next. 50 Amandry 1981, pp. 81-82, fig. 4.

The remains are now believed to belong to blocks of houses; the Quarter, as far as it has been investigated, seems to consist of houses in which potters and coroplasts may have lived and, to some extent, worked. The industrial installations have not yet been found in the relatively narrow area of the plateau so far excavated. 54 C. K. Williams 1982, p. 12; Roebuck 1972, pp. 122, 125; on the distribution of industrial sites with respect to available resources, see Arafat and Morgan 1989, p. 315. A similar pattern of habitation can still be observed in the modern villages of Corinth. 55 A similar phenomenon, also based on custom rather than distance, is the existence in large modern cities of neighbor- hoods with distinctive identities and closely guarded loyalties. 56 Salmon 1984, pp. 402-405.</page><page sequence="56">32 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS The latest versions of the peplos-figurine type with long, unbelted overfold are C22 and C23. Both figurines wear narrow, pointed shoes, which place them in the Early Hellenistic period. The foot-forward pose of C23, as well as the triangular fold dropping unbroken from the overfold to the knee, are strikingly similar to a hydriaphoros statue in Syracuse, thought to be a replica of an Early Classical Sicilian type.57 The significance of this similarity is difficult to explain, particularly since the figurine cannot be Early Classical in date. Perhaps it stands at the end of a series of figurines, which is as yet absent from the archaeological record, originally inspired by Sicilian sculpture. It is typical of the peplos-figurines that an Early Classical type should be reflected so late. A similar tendency has been noted in sculptural production.58 As in the case of the peplos-figurine type with short overfold, the chronological information to be gained from the pottery contexts is rather limited, but it confirms what is evident from technique and style. The long-overfold figurines made in the Potters' Quarter must predate the closing of those workshops in the later 4th century B.C. The pottery contexts that are not thoroughly mixed contain pottery ranging from the 6th to the late 4th or first quarter of the 3rd century B.C. C23, which is clearly of later style than the others, comes from a pottery context dating from the 5th to the later 3rd century B.C. It is unfortunate that the stylistically earliest and best-made pieces are from mixed contexts. 3. Peplos-figurines with long overfold, belted (C24-C34). The earliest appearance of this peplos type, the so-called peplos of Athena,59 may be C24, which can be dated to the middle to third quarter of the 5th century B.C. by virtue of a complete example found in an Argive tomb.60 This figurine, although smaller than C24, shows a closely similar fold pattern. Its left leg is slightly advanced and bent, and it stands on a high, rectangular base with splaying sides similar to that of C19. Both arms are at the sides; the right hand holds a phiale. The poorly preserved head is small, on a long, thin neck; the hair is bound up. The source, at least for the torso, may be a mid-5th-century B.C. Rhodian type.61 Most of the Corinthian figurines wearing the belted peplos, however, belong to the later 5th and 4th centuries B.C. Among these figurines a style emerges that is clearly influenced by Attic art of the later 5th century B.C. Curiously, on the basis of evidence so far available, Attic types and styles seem to have been transferred to Corinthian figurines only to a limited degree directly from Attic coroplastic work. Among the figurines from the Demeter sanctuary, direct mechanical connection with Attic work is likely in the case of an Asiatic dancer (C281), which may have been molded from an Attic figurine vase, a female head (C104), and a seated Pan (C277), the molds for which probably were taken directly from imported Attic figurines. In addition, a draped articulated "doll" (C181) is very close to an Athenian type (see pp. 59-60). Influences in the other direction are demonstrated by the presence in the Athenian Agora of imported Corinthian molds and archetypes,62 as well as Corinthian figurines dating from the late Archaic to the Hellenistic period.63 Theoretically, the figurines and workshop materials found in Athens that have proven to be Corinthian on the basis of laboratory tests could have been made in Athens of imported Corinthian clay, but they are matched or approximated by pieces in Corinth and seem acceptable as imports.64 There is some 57 Tolle-Kastenbein 1986, pp. 57-62, pls. 56-61, with ad- ditional replicas and bibliography; the attribution has been questioned by Ridgway's review (1988, pp. 526-527) and the type dated after the Severe period. 58 Ridgway 1970, pp. 93-105; Ridgway 1997, pp. 11-14, with bibliography on p. 22, note 21. 59 For a useful collection of sculptured versions, see Berger 1967.

The facial type seems to be Attic.</page><page sequence="57">DISCUSSION 33 question regarding the degree to which Corinthian clay may have been brought to Athens as a raw material. Modern ethnographic evidence suggests that clays were not transported very far from their place of origin, and local sources were preferred whenever available.65 It has been suggested, however, that Corinthian clay was imported to Athens for use as the finer surface layer of architectural terracottas.66 If this is true, small quantities of the material could have been available to coroplasts. Contrary to the usual practice, Athenian potters were obliged to transport clay a considerable distance even for simple pottery,67 and consequently they may have had the organization in place for transporting clay from Corinthian beds. Some Attic figurine imports of the Archaic period are recognizable in the Demeter sanctuary.68 For the Classical period, there are the early-4th-century B.C. hydriaphoros 123 and perhaps the seated figurine C80, if it is not Corinthian; others are Early Hellenistic in date (124-142). The Corinth collection contains a few more Attic imports; the Attic "doll" mentioned below (p. 52), from the Forum Southwest excavations, is an import of the Classical period. The trade with Athens in coroplastic workshop materials or finished figurines, never very brisk, apparently was not affected by the intermittent state of war in the later 5th and early 4th centuries B.C., just as Athenian pottery reached Corinth at this time.69 In any case, until more imported Athenian coroplastic material of this period is discovered in Corinth, it is best to assume that a significant imprint on the developing Corinthian style was made by Attic sculpture, probably in the course of the general dispersal of Attic-trained sculptors at this time. This movement ultimately created through much of the Greek world and the surrounding lands a welter of local styles more or less derived from Attic sculpture of the second half of the 5th century B.C. As a result, general stylistic resemblances between Attic and Corinthian figurines of this period are more common than exact correlations. The late-5th-century B.C. Attic influence on Sicilian coroplasts also is thought to have come through sources in sculpture and vase painting rather than terracotta figurines.70 Some of the Attic influence on Corinthian figurines could have come through small marble sculpture, specifically Attic or Attic-type votive reliefs or statuettes, some of which are thought to be reduced copies of well-known monumental sculptures.71 Both groups would be particularly relevant here, since representations of Demeter and Kore are prominent among them and stylistic connections with the figurines can be cited. This source of inspiration must remain hypothetical, however, because only one rather crude 5th-century B.C. votive relief has been found in Corinth up to now; the rest are not earlier than the 4th century B.C. in date.72 In truth, it is not encouraging that no votive reliefs were found in the Asklepieion, where they might be expected. There are as yet no 5th-century B.C. statuettes from the excavations. The new peplos-figurine type treated here wears a long overfold girded at, or somewhat above, the natural waistline, with the cloth puffed lightly over the belt. The style reflected in the figurines is close to the Attic "quiet" style of the later 5th century B.C.73 No complete example is preserved, but it is conceivable that the lower part is represented by C26, which shows the hem 65 Jones 1984, p. 26; Blitzer 1990, p. 680. 66 H.

At a larger scale, and with the pose reversed, is the fragmentary C27. Although the curve of the overfold at the hip suggests that the garment was girded at the natural waist like others in this group, the heavier trailing of the hem points to a somewhat later date, certainly not earlier than the 4th century B.C. The original fold pattern of the type is difficult to retrieve, owing to dull impressions and sometimes heavy retouch, but probably the closest to the archetype is the fragmentary C28. The mold from which this figurine was made still included the delicately puffed folds over the belt, as well as a realistic detail, the overlap of the back of the peplos where it was pinned at the shoulder.75 The smaller C25 is also very finely made, its peplos, almost as thin as a chiton, arranged in a series of shallow catenaries between and below the fully contoured breasts, descending to gently pouched folds over the belt. Its style recalls a marble statuette from the Athenian Akropolis,76 but the folds are more static and repetitive. In this case, the very regular series of parallel catenaries is more typical of coroplastic work than of sculpture and is also seen in a group of peplos-figurines from the Asklepieion,77 as well as in Attic figurines wearing this dress.78 A group of three figurines (C29-C31) represents the most common version of the type, its dull impressions and consequent heavy retouch indicating frequent repetition. This group may be derived from the same archetype as C28, but if so, the mechanical link has been lost. The upper arms are at the sides, the forearms extended, either forward or slightly to the sides. The diagonal break of C30, across the abdomen and up the left side of the torso, suggests that a mantle may have been added, similar to the arrangement of one of the Grimani statuettes.79 There are no traces of the mantle on the left shoulder, but the ruffling of the hair at that point suggests that something originally was there. Both the figurine and the statuette have long, bound locks of hair down the back.80 An unusual addition was made to C31 in the form of a small scarf around the shoulders. In the latest version of the type, the large (size range 4-5), highly sculptural, and unfortunately very fragmentary C32, which dates probably to the later 4th century B.C., the belt is high, just below the breasts. A curious variant can be seen in the nearly complete C33. It must have been made in the Potters' Quarter, to judge from its fabric and head type, which is similar to the heads of articulated "dolls," and from its arm with mitten-shaped hand, which is of a type meant to hang loosely from the "doll's" shoulder and is thus attached awkwardly (cf. C168 for the head and C122 for the arm). The figurine was made by joining these elements to an unretouched torso and base of such a dull impression that the overfold hem and bodice folds scarcely can be seen. The contrast between this sort of coroplastic pastiche and such sculptural work as C32 is truly striking. The style and method of this "doll" workshop (Workshop A, p. 344) is so distinctive that two pieces in museum collections may be attributed to it, a standing, draped female figurine in the Louvre, and a seated goddess in Boston; another likely workshop mate is a standing, draped female figurine carrying a rolled fillet and a box (present whereabouts unknown).81 74 Ridgway 1981 a, p. 123, with bibliography, fig. 96.

Her garment is a chiton rather than a peplos, since it is sewn or pinned along the shoulders into brief sleeves, but it is included here because the handling of the drapery is related to the "quiet" style that underlies this group. Its restrained linear style and light touch, however, are more in the spirit of 4th-century B.C. renderings. Most of the representations of young people from the Demeter sanctuary are either large-scale terracotta sculptures82 or much smaller figurines; this piece stands alone in its size range. These figurines of children probably represented votaries, and C34 may be a large, fine, and early version of a type such as H43. Comparison with the girl votary or priestess type from Brauron, and related statues, comes to mind, but the stylistic differences are considerable.83 The peplos-figurines with long, belted overfold could represent either votaries or perhaps one of the goddesses. The long overfold sometimes is thought to have been worn especially by younger or unmarried women,84 and if this is true, the figurines would represent young female votaries or perhaps Kore. With the addition of a mantle, this peplos type is known for Kore in a statuette from Mycenae representing her with Demeter.85 The identity of the "Demeter" from Eleusis, who wears a belted peplos with a long overfold, has been questioned, principally because her costume is more often associated with Athena, but the discovery of so many figurines in this costume in the Demeter sanctuary may support the identification of the statue in Eleusis as one of the Eleusinian goddesses (see p. 34, note 74). Attributes, costumes, and coiffures were frequently shared by different deities in the process of artistic cross-fertilization that was normal in Greek art. The useful pottery contexts containing peplos-figurines with a long, belted overfold include material dating from the 6th or 5th century B.C. to the late 4th or early 3rd. Although the chronology is not specific enough to date the material closely, it does offer some general confirma- tion of the chronological range suggested by technique and style. 4. Peplos-figurines with kolpos and overfold (C35-C43). The fourth and last peplos-figurine type, ultimately of 5th-century Attic origin but very widespread and lasting into the Early Hellenistic period, shows the overfold to the hips, resting on a thick, richly gathered kolpos. Of the examples in the Demeter sanctuary, the earliest and best is C35, unfortunately only a fragment of a large (size range 4-5), well-crafted piece, thin-walled, hard fired, and carefully modeled. Its wide, flat pleats and kolpos decoratively modeled with butterfly folds recall, among votive reliefs, such renderings as the Demeter of a late-5th-century B.C. relief in Copenhagen,86 thought to be of Peloponnesian workmanship, although of Attic type. It also can be seen, in a more schematic form, among the Grimani statuettes.87 This type is, of course, one of the most enduring in Greek plastic art. It is associated in different periods with a variety of subjects, especially female divinities, and is known in a seemingly inexhaustible variety of drapery patterns. In the present context, figurines with this peplos arrangement probably represent Demeter or Kore, although they need not be based upon any particular cult image. Small-scale figures of deities often are thought to reflect cult statues, occasionally with specific evidence,88 based on the generally held assumption that large works of art give rise to smaller copies and adaptations, rather than the reverse. Not only is this assumption rather dubious from the point of view of method, since artists often begin with sketches or models of smaller scale than the intended work, but we cannot know to what extent coroplasts were able to view cult statues, particularly those in other communities. 82 Publication forthcoming by Nancy Bookidis. 83 Vorster 1983, pp. 330-344, nos. 1-38, with bibliography. 84 See p. 30, note 45. 85 Kabus-Jahn 1972, p. 77, fig. 2 opposite p. 78. 86 Mitropoulou 1977, pp. 45-46, no. 67, fig. 105; Neumann 1979, pp. 43-44, pl. 24:a. 87 Kabus-Jahn 1972, pp. 51-59, pls. 28-35, veiled Demeter statuette with polos. 88 E.g., Zuntz 1971, p. 158, note 3; see also Alroth 1989, pp. 106, 108.</page><page sequence="60">36 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS The designs for major cult statues could, of course, have been transmitted through models or other workshop materials, but it denigrates the Greek artisan to assume that he could not have constructed a figure of a deity through his own general sense of what the god or goddess ought to look like, in dress, attributes, and physical type. The great variety among peplos-figurines of this type is best explained by such independent creations. See also pages 134-135 on this subject. Almost certainly a representation ofDemeter is C36, a 4th-century B.C. peplos-figurine with a swung hip, wearing a shoulder-pinned back mantle, which probably was lifted high in the left hand. This is one of Demeter's typical poses in votive and document reliefs,89 although figurines in this pose from elsewhere in the Peloponnesos are thought to represent Hera.90 In Hera's case, the pose refers to the anakalypteria of a bride; while Demeter usually is not considered a patroness of marriage,91 her cult in Corinth appears to have included that function (see pp. 127, 170). A peplos-figurine from Perachora, dated late 5th-early 4th century B.C., also lifts the mantle with one hand while holding in the other a phiale, presumably for libation; in this case, the figurine probably represents Hera, who was worshiped at Perachora.92 Alternatively, C36 could have leaned on a long scepter held in the raised left hand, while the right hand held out a phiale; Demeter appears in this pose in a votive relief in Paris.93 There is a particularly Peloponnesian flavor in the drapery of C36, especially in the deeply curved ridge on the overfold, which drops from the left shoulder and encloses and frames the opposite breast. A similar framing mannerism is found, for example, in the akroteria of the Temple of Asklepios at Epidauros.94 It can also be seen in smaller scale on the above-mentioned relief in Copenhagen.95 A hip fragment (C38) hints at a larger (size range 4-5) and more richly modeled peplos-figurine of this type. A still larger (size range 5) version, preserved only in a tantalizing shoulder fragment (C37), could have held a scepter or torch in the upraised hand, since the mantle seems to drop down behind the arm. Its deep modeling is so thoroughly sculptural in concept that it is hard to resist the idea that the archetypes of such terracotta statuettes also served as models for small-scale versions in stone, such as a statuette of Demeter from Kos.96 A piece of much poorer quality (C39) is more typical of figurines of this type found in the sanctuary, however. The skirt fragment of a peplos-figurine of large scale (C40) has such deeply cut folds that the inner surface of the right leg has been cut away. The shadows are so deep that one thinks of Hellenistic sculpture, but the stance, with feet fairly close together and one foot drawn to the side, is Classical, the mirror image of C26. Three figurines (C41-C43) seem to represent the final manifestation of this peplos-figurine type. In these figurines, the overfold hem has disappeared entirely, leaving only the thickened edge of the kolpos. This variant, in which the kolpos forms a definite arch framing the thighs, was used to represent Demeter in a marble statuette from Kos.97 This statuette, a rather mediocre 89 E.g., Peschlow-Bindokat 1972, pp. 111-113, figs. 34, 35 (= M. Meyer 1989, p. 266, no. A5, dated 422/421 B.C.); also the relief in Copenhagen, p. 35, note 86 above.

Plutarch (Moralia 138b) mentions the participa- tion of a priestess of Demeter in the preparation of a bride. Demeter was a patroness of marriage and betrothal on Kos: N. Robertson 1983, pp. 164-169. To see Demeter alone in a dream was considered auspicious for marriage (Artemidoros, Oneirokritika 2, no. 39). In the wedding procession of Peleus and Thetis on the Francois vase, Demeter is grouped with Hestia and the nymph Chariklo at the head of the procession, imme- diately after Iris and Chiron, approaching the house of Peleus, in which the bride sits (Arias and Hirmer 1962, p. 289, pl. 44 center). 92 See note 90. 93 Hamiaux 1992, p. 215, no. 223. 94 Yalouris 1992, pp. 32-33, no. 27, pls. 30, 31. 95 See p. 35, note 86; for a detail of this figure, see Hiller 1971, pl. 8, fig. 22. 96 Kabus-Preisshofen 1975, pp. 46-50, pls. 19-21. 97 Kabus-Preisshofen 1975, pp. 36-39, pls. 11, 12.</page><page sequence="61">DISCUSSION 37 4th-century B.C. rendering, wears a shoulder-pinned back mantle, as in C42. The head, which does not join the torso directly and may not belong to it, is a later version of a 5th-century B.C. type, with a straight-sided, heavy-jawed, large-featured face bearing a strong resemblance to C53. The figurines of this group are instructive technically, since C42 and C43 share a large mold defect on the left thigh. Therefore, the two must be related mechanically, and yet the handmade additions and the tooling are so extensive that the figurines are entirely different in appearance, in both proportions and drapery. As far as the relationship can be reconstructed, C43, which is larger, must be the earlier generation; its scar is more pronounced. C42 and C41 are equal to one another in size, although the latter seems smaller because it is incomplete at the left side and the shoulder-pinned back mantle was never added; they seem to be from parallel molds. Both show the same revision of the line of the kolpos into an arch, done either to minimize the effect of the scar or to update the drapery style, but in C41 the mold defect has been completely repaired, while in C42 only the area above the kolpos has been altered. In spite of the strong, sculpturally based beginnings of this group, a sharp technical decline can be noted; badly worn molds continued in use, even defective molds, as in C42 and C43. The figurines were roughly touched up with a blade to add detail. The last members of this group may have been made as late as the 3rd century B.C., since C43 is elongated in proportions and narrow shouldered. While the workshops of the Potters' Quarter may have been conservative and artistically unassuming, there is nothing there to suggest the utter lack of interest in the fundamental standards of workmanship seen in these figurines. Together with other poorly made pieces of 3rd-century B.C. date, they may be part of a general decline in some workshops in Corinth at that time. The pottery contexts of peplos-figurines with kolpos and overfold are, unfortunately, not very useful, since the contexts either are of completely mixed date or do not show a clear pattern of terminal date. What is clear is that, with the possible exception of C35, which could be of later-5th-century B.C. date on technical and stylistic grounds, the figurines of this group belong to the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. The poorest of all (C43) is from a pottery context dating from the 5th to the later 3rd century B.C., and it is likely that it was made well into the 3rd century B.C. Of the four groups of peplos-figurines, this one was the last to be abandoned. There is no evidence that it was made in the Potters' Quarter, and presumably for this reason it was not affected by the closing of the workshops there in the later 4th century B.C. In any case, by the last quarter of the 3rd century B.C., other figurines had taken the place of the last survivors of the Classical tradition of peplos-figurines. A LOCAL COPY OF A RHODIAN TYPE A standing female figurine with a mantle draped over the left arm, C44 is different in type from all the others and is very likely a mechanical copy of a mid-5th-century B.C. imported Rhodian figurine.98 There are several other instances of Rhodian inspiration in Corinthian figurines in this period. The head C103 was probably inspired by a Rhodian head type often connected with similar torsos with the mantle over the arm (see p. 48). Another torso (C24) also may be of Rhodian inspiration, although in this case the figurine is related to a known local type (see p. 32). For Rhodian influence on protomes, see pages 74 and 76. 98 Cf., e.g., British Museum I, p. 83, nos. 210-212, pl. 37; the left hand, however, is more like that of British Museum I, p. 85, no. 220, pl. 8; Lindos I, col. 549, no. 2269, pl. 105.</page><page sequence="62">38 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS HYDRIAPHOROI AND RELATED HEADS (C45-C69) The hydriaphoros type first appeared in southwest Asia Minor during the transition from the Archaic to the Severe period.99 Of the Asiatic examples known up to now, those from Iasos appear to be the earliest, on the basis of style.100 The type is frequently found in association with the cult of Demeter. 101 Most of the Corinthian hydriaphoroi from the Demeter sanctuary wear the peplos, and for this reason some of the fragmentary peplos-figurines also may have been hydriaphoroi. In addition to the catalogued examples, approximately twenty hydriaphoros fragments have been counted in the lots. Hydriaphoroi are not common in the sanctuary after the 4th century B.C., the only Hellenistic examples being the rather poor types H48-H51. Perhaps their place as votives was taken by miniature hydriai, which became an important votive type in the Hellenistic period.l02 The symbolic value of both hydriai and hydriaphoros figurines in a fertility cult is very clear, with references to the ritual bathing of brides and the dead, as well as agriculture. 103 The hydriaphoroi also may reflect the carrying of waterjars as a part of cult ritual, perhaps for the purpose of ritual purification.104 The provision of bathing facilities in many of the dining rooms and the presence of perirrhanteria point to the importance of cleansing in the sanctuary rituals. 105 The stylistically earliest Corinthian hydriaphoroi are the fragmentary torso C45 and the heads C51 and C52. They do not seem to be as early as those from Iasos but stylistically should belong to the Severe period. They are similar to a complete hydriaphoros in Copenhagen, of reported Corinthian provenience.106 On the basis of three similar heads from Tiryns,107 the type has been considered Argive, but given the Corinthian provenience of the example in Copenhagen and the discovery of this group at the Demeter sanctuary, it is perhaps more likely that the Tirynthian figurines are to be counted among the Corinthian imports at that site.108 The source of the type is not immediately obvious; probably it developed out of the local peplos-figurines, in imitation of an Asiatic type but in a more Peloponnesian style. It is possible that the hydriaphoros type was known in Corinth in sculptural form in the Severe period. Schuchhardt has suggested that a marble peplophoros found in the excavation of the Lerna fountain could have been a hydriaphoros.109 Since there is no direct stylistic connection between this sculpture and any of the figurines identifiable as hydriaphoroi, however, it is more likely that the figurines were in this case a separate coroplastic creation. A cylindrical form on the heads, just below the hydria, resembles a polos but probably was meant to be the head ring used to support the vessel, as seen on red-figured vases110 and perhaps also on the heads C58 and C60. Other hydriaphoroi, such as Classical and Early Hellenistic examples from Theangela, show such a support very clearly.l11 Perhaps when the type was 99 Isik 1980, p. 77. 100 Levi 1967/1968, p. 574, fig. 43. 101 For useful collections of material, see Knossos, p. 68; Isik 1980, pp. 181-186; Winter, Typen I, pp. 156-159; Diehl 1964, pp. 189-192; Lilibaki-Akamati 1996, pp. 50-51. 102 Corinth XVIII, i, p. 104. 103 A Subgeometric hydriaphoros figurine from a grave in Crete (Diehl 1964, p. 129, pl. 45:2) is nude, has one hand at her breast, and takes a squatting pose that reveals the pudenda, linking the hydria to fertility symbolism as well as death. Bearing in mind the chthonic nature of the deities honored in the sanctuary, hydriaphoroi could also refer to the Danaids, the eternal water carriers in Hades. I owe this interesting suggestion to Brunilde S. Ridgway. 104 Cole 1986, pp. 164-165.

There is also a mixture of styles in this hydriaphoros group, since the coiffure of C52 combines broad waves framing the forehead, characteristic of heads of the Severe period, with flat, triangular masses of hair framing the neck, a surviving Archaic feature. A few figurines seem to be later versions of this hydriaphoros type. The fragmentary C46 has more freely rendered folds, although it still seems to belong to the Classical period. A degenerate survival can be seen in C47, which still shows the rectangular outline of its Classical ancestors. The right arm may have been raised to support a hydria, but the detail has been lost in this piece, and the hips are uncharacteristically thrust forward. The woman also carries a piglet in her lowered left hand. The hydriaphoros with piglet is not known in any other examples in Corinth but appears elsewhere in the Peloponnesos.1l4 Another late hydriaphoros is the fragmentary C48; the swing of the figure's weight to one side suggests a date well into the 4th century B.C. A similar date is indicated for C49 by the high girding of the peplos. The drawing of the skirt to the side, however, and the horizontally crimped hair are recollections of an earlier style. Only one example (C50) is preserved of the Asiatic type of hydriaphoros, in which a mantle is draped across the abdomen and hips.115 A quite different hydriaphoros head type, represented by C53 and C54, in which the foot of the hydria is balanced directly on a wide mass of curly hair, is much more vital and plastic in appearance (although the lower face of C54 is missing) and seems less derivative. Its archetype probably should be dated stylistically ca. 470-460 B.C. It is larger than the previous type, of statuette scale (size range 4). In a technically poorer form, it also is known in Boeotia. 116 In some aspects of their structure, the faces of this group are reminiscent of some faces of Archaic figurines from the sanctuary, 117 and elements of this facial type persist in Corinth even into the Hellenistic period. The shape is distinctly long and narrow, more oblong than oval, with rather straight sides. The forehead is low, the cheeks are flat, and the jaw is rounded and heavy. The level eyes are large, extending nearly to the temples because of the narrowness of the head at this point. The upper and lower lids are equally curved and well defined. The browridge is strongly marked and follows the curve of the upper eyelid. The shape of the nose is often obscured by chipping or abrasion, but it is always large and close to the upper lip. The mouth is wide and the lips very full and unsmiling, even sometimes downturned, though with a strong double arch of the upper lip. Sometimes the outer corners of the lips do not meet, probably because the division between them was continually retouched as the mold series progressed, and the mouth consequently has an almost rectangular outline. In its general appearance, this head type is the earthy, heavy-jawed, full-lipped, large-nosed, thick-lidded type seen in Severe Style sculpture and well known in the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.118 In the figurines, however, the head is usually narrower across the cheekbones, in relation to its length, than the Olympia heads; in this respect it finds good parallels in youthful male heads such as that of the Delphi Charioteer119 and a bronze head from the Athenian 112 To see how this could have happened, one may compare hydriaphoros heads in Copenhagen, Danish National Museum, pl. 21, nos. 205, 206, which have supports resembling poloi, with other heads on the same plate wearing the polos alone. 113 Louvre I, p. 99, no.

Among non-Corinthian figurines, the closest parallels can be found among heads from Medma, pointing to yet another stylistic connection with West Greek coroplastic art.121 In a similar stylistic mode is a Sicilian terracotta head from the Demeter sanctuary in Grammichele; this head has been compared to Corinthian heads of ca. 460-450 B.C.122 The cheeks of this larger head are fuller, but there is a distinct similarity in the distribution of the features over the facial surface and in the mobile, slightly parted, down-curved lips. These hydriaphoroi also are notable for their bushy, stippled coiffures, which were added to heads with short, wavy hair; in C55, for example, wavy locks resembling those of the male head C206 can still be seen down the left side of the face, beneath the added hair. A double-scalloped wave pattern at the center of the forehead recalls a motif seen repeatedly in the Olympia sculptures123 and also in a mid-6th-century B.C. limestone head of a sphinx from Corinth.124 Hair masses that were relatively large and wide in proportion to the face were a prevailing style in terracottas in the 5th century B.C., not exclusive to any one place. Very wide, elaborate coiffures (or wigs) were favored somewhat later in the 5th century B.C. in Boeotian figurines,125 in the context of bridal iconography, but the arrangements are far more complex and are usually combined with plaits, of which there are no traces in the Corinthian heads. A wide, wavy coiffure is known in later Classical Sicilian protomes in combination with a polos.126 The all-over stippling of the hair with a small pointed tool is characteristic of the Corinthian figurines of this type and may have been a shorthand suggestion of the ringlets characteristic of some Archaic coiffures. The long corkscrew curls descending to the shoulders seen in C53 do not really belong to this bushy coiffure nor to the simply waved, caplike arrangement beneath the bushy mass. They belong to a coiffure in which strands of hair are wrapped over a fillet and tucked behind the ears before falling in front over the shoulders. Replicas of the Mantua Apollo show this arrangement in detail.127 In C58 and C61, the hair-wrapped fillet appears, probably together with long locks in front. Perhaps the existence of such coiffures on Early Classical figurines may help to clarify questions concerning the Apolline hairstyles of this period found in Roman replicas.128 Corkscrew curls are also found on an early-5th-century B.C. sculptured terracotta head from the Demeter sanctuary.129 Several other heads are included in this group because of their stylistic similarities, although it is not known if they actually were hydriaphoroi. Heads C55 and C56, with oddly flat-topped, bushy hair, originally could have had a hydria or perhaps a tray, basket, or headdress attached with an adhesive to the top, but traces of such objects are lacking. These heads could have 120 Rolley 1986, pp. 102-103, 238, no. 239; Ridgway 1970, p. 41, no. 11; Hurwit 1989, pp. 51-52, 74-75, fig. 30, with bibliography; the head is variously dated between 480 and 460 B.C. 121 Cf.

(C57-C59, C65). The later examples are smaller, but it is not possible to establish a continuous mold series, nor is it clear how many of these heads originally belonged to hydriaphoroi. C58 and C60 are pierced at the top of the head, as if they were articulated "dolls," but more likely the added circlets around the holes are the head rings of hydriai, and the holes received dowels, which secured the vessels in place. A similar technique of doweling was used for arms, which were fastened into holes pierced in the elbows of seated figurines, such as C74 and C82. The piercing of the head, however, does suggest a connection with a workshop accustomed to making articulated "dolls." In fact, there is a possible mechanical connection of C59 with the "doll's" head C141 (see catalogue); some of the hydriaphoroi have distorted noses, a feature shared by this "doll." Since most of the articulated "dolls" seem to have been made in workshops in the Potters' Quarter, these later Classical variants of the hydriaphoros head type are likely to have been made there as well; C58 and C59 somewhat resemble a head mold found in the Potters' Quarter.131 If this is correct, a pattern of production similar to that of the peplos-figurines is evident. That is, there is no evidence for the production of Early Classical hydriaphoroi in the Potters' Quarter, but artisans in 4th-century B.C. workshops there may have produced variations of models created in the 5th century B.C. elsewhere in Corinth, by craftsmen with better sculptural skills and a wider knowledge of the arts. C60 and C61, also 4th-century B.C. in date by virtue of their high, triangular foreheads, are broken fairly cleanly around the contours of the jaw, suggesting that drapery originally covered the neck and that these figurines therefore were mantled.132 The same would be true of C62 and C63, two heads probably representing two generations. They are of a large scale similar to that of C60 and C61, but they are much coarser in workmanship and have heavy features that fill the faces. Although these heads are probably of Hellenistic date, their facial structure and coiffure show them to be Classical survivals. The horizontal locks of hair to either side of the central part in C63 may be all that remains of a more refined and complex coiffure like that of C61. The earlier generation of the two heads (C62) also is of poor workmanship: the elements of the coiffure are hidden by rough slashes and the earring is separated from the ear. Perhaps we are dealing with parallel mold series. The carrying of objects other than a hydria on the head, such as a tray or possibly a kanoun, would be consistent with a cult of Demeter,133 but the evidence for such figurines in Corinth is very slight, the only possibility being C68. This head balances what appears to be a tray or the lower part of a kanoun, with a lump at the center, resembling somewhat the kanoun carried by a kanephoros from Tiryns; this vessel holds a round, knoblike cake at the center.134 If the carrying on the head of any sort of tray or vessel other than a hydria was part of the sanctuary ritual, it has left little mark on the surviving figurines. The large number of model likna from the sanctuary135 suggests that trays of food offerings were carried, possibly in procession but not necessarily on the head. The partially preserved hollow object on the head of C66 could be a hydria, but the rather wide base leaves open the possibility that it could be a different type of vessel. The hydria C69 must have rested on the head of a figurine, to judge from the remains of locks of hair around the 130 MF-6403, Corinth XII, p. 32, no. 123, pl. 8; the hair is waved rather than stippled in this example. 131 KH-27, Corinth XV, i, pp. 98-99, no. 29, pl. 33; a break in ,the mold has partly obliterated the features. The face of the mold is more oval, but the nose distortion is similar. 132 The facial structure of the heads is reminiscent of a 4th- century B.C. Tarentine type: Herdejurgen 1978, p. 47, no. A40. 133 See examples from the Athenian Agora: D. B. Thompson 1954, pp. 94-98. 134 Tiryns I, p. 74, no. 72, fig. 17 (kanoun); pl.

Theoretically, it should be possible to date the figurine by comparing the shape of the hydria with the hydriskoi from the sanctuary.136 Probably because of the smaller scale and indifferent workmanship of C69, however, its shape does not quite correspond with any of the votive vessels. The rounder facial type of Attic inspiration sometimes found among the smaller peplos- figurines (Cll) and the articulated "dolls" (e.g., C159) appears occasionally in this group as well (C67). A late-5th-century Attic head type with full cheeks and a triangular forehead also appears (C64); it is found in the imported Attic hydriaphoros 123 but without a demonstrable mechanical connection to the Corinthian figurine. A head archetype from the Athenian Agora,137 thought to be made of Corinthian clay, is also comparable in facial type. Pottery contexts are not very helpful in dating the hydriaphoroi and related heads, since most come from mixed fills dating from the Archaic to the Roman periods. However, C45, C56, C59, C61, and a mold sibling of C52 all come from lots with mainly pre-Hellenistic pottery. The latest terminal date, the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C., belongs to C54, which, however, is clearly one of the earlier members of the group. It seems fair to say that on the basis of present evidence, this group did not survive the end of the 4th century B.C. If, as seems likely, its later members were made in the Potters' Quarter, the cessation of activity in the workshops there in the later 4th century would account for the loss of the type. SEATED DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES AND RELATED HEADS (C70-C101) Among the Classical figurines, there are considerably fewer seated than standing females, and their development is not as consistent. Corinthian coroplasts apparently continued to find a market for seated goddess figurines in a lingering Archaic style.138 Even the stylistically updated 5th-century B.C. versions of Archaic types treated in this chapter show a very strong conservatism, particularly in pose. Their roots in the Archaic period are not surprising, since the frontally seated pose, the polos, and the majestic bearing suggest that these figurines represent goddesses. There may have been some reluctance in the more conservative workshops to develop a new goddess type without a pressing reason to do so; the first appearance of Early Classical style in standing votaries rather than in seated goddesses is consistent with such an attitude. The Classical reworkings of Archaic seated goddesses were developed in the Potters' Quarter, as the discovery there of both molds and figurines demonstrates. The most direct stylistic descendants of Archaic seated figurines are C71-C77. The horizontal projections of the chair and the long locks of hair to the shoulders are familiar elements. The rectangular footstool is also familiar, although now the chair and the footrest are elevated on a rectangular base. The hands may rest flat on the lap, or a bird or flower may be held to the chest.139 A complete example in the National Museum, Athens, shows both hands at the chest somewhat in the manner of the Early Classical protome type represented by the fragments C251-C257.140 When the heads are preserved, a polos is worn, either high and flaring or low and wide. Newer elements of 5th-century B.C. style are the hair framing the forehead, which waves in rounded masses from a central part, the relatively fluid peplos folds, and, most of all, the face (see C73, which is fully Classical). In C76, however, the large, protruding eyes recall 136 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 10-12, 168-169, fig. 1 on p. 11, pl. 50. 137 E. R.

In lot 3222 there is a small frag- ment of the seat at the right side, showing the characteristic pointed fold that overlaps the seat.</page><page sequence="67">DISCUSSION 43 Archaic style. The freely rendered bird of C77, with wings outspread, is also worth noting as a new element.141 The type evolves into the seated figurines of the later 5th and 4th centuries B.C., such as C78 and C79. The relatively undifferentiated seated figurines of the Archaic tradition probably could have been identified by worshipers with any of several goddesses. In the Classical and Hellenistic periods, the iconography becomes more specific, although sometimes there is still a confusing syncretic overlap of types, probably mirroring the overlap in cultic function. In other arts, when Demeter and Kore are pictured together, they usually are distinguishable from one another by their attributes or characteristic costume, but when they are represented separately, their iconography inevitably overlaps. For example, a Corinthian plate of the Sam Wide group in Athens bears a detailed representation of an enthroned goddess with virtually every attribute imaginable for both Demeter and Kore.142 Seated outdoors, she holds a torch, ears of grain, and a branch of poppy-seed pods or pomegranates; a fig is set on a rocky altar in front of her; she wears a chiton, peplos, and mantle, is barefoot, and has a kalathos for wool or food on her head; a richly patterned, warp-fringed cloth covers her throne; and a bird flies behind her. She seems to incorporate the chthonic qualities of Kore with the agricultural function of Demeter, as well as the domestic traits implicit in the Corinthian cult title Demeter Epoikidie.143 The bird is more commonly associated with Aphrodite, but in the cultic iconography of the Lokroi plaques is given also to Kore. 144 When associated with the chthonic goddess, the bird may suggest Aphrodite as well and thus the erotic aspects of a fertile marriage. Although Aphrodite had a well-known sanctuary of her own on Acrocorinth, she is unmistakably represented in a number of 4th-century B.C. figurines from the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore (pp. 169-176) and may well have been a presence there earlier as well. Another example of the overlapping attributes of Demeter and Kore can be found in a seated figurine similar in type to the Corinthian, wearing the flaring polos, from the Sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros at Selinus. The figurine holds a pomegranate and a handful of grain, and in the context of that sanctuary ought to represent Demeter.145 Elsewhere, however, the same attributes are associated with Kore.146 The Corinthian seated figurines with attributes preserved hold a flower bud (C71), which suggests Kore,147 or a bird (C77), pointing to either Kore or Aphrodite.l48 The shape of the flaring polos could imitate a kalathos, and if this was intentional, the implication of the full basket, namely, abundance, would be most appropriate for Demeter. It is very likely, however, that neither coroplasts nor worshipers intended to distinguish the goddesses from one another as strictly as we would suppose but rather accepted an imagery of abundance and fertility that called all three goddesses to mind. The latest versions of the old-fashioned seated goddess type (C78 and C79) belong stylistically to the 4th century B.C. Although the hieratic pose and the chair with projections persist, the high girding of C78, its softly rounded forms, and the cluster of curls on the head speak of an Early Hellenistic date. Apart from the pose and the chair, the hieratic appearance has melted away from the type. The occupant of the seat, bareheaded, youthful, and holding what appears to 141 A figurine from Syracuse holds a bird with outspread wings and is also comparable in the chair type and coiffure (Winter, Typen I, p. 128, no. 1 = Kekule 1884, p. 58, pl. 11:2). 142 Callipolitis-Feytmans 1962, pp. 141-143, 163, no. 60, pl.

Two types seem to have merged in this new creation, the traditional seated goddess, known through repeatedly updated mold series, and a newer type of the Early Hellenistic period, the seated young girl holding an offering (see H339 and H340). In the new type, a cubical, backless seat replaces the goddesses' usual chair, the pose is more relaxed, and the offering is held more naturally on the lap or beside the thigh.'49 C80 is similarly hieratic in pose, youthful in appearance, and Early Hellenistic in style and is one of the Corintho-Attic puzzles among the figurines. It is the only example of this type yet found in Corinth. It has a long, clinging overfold similar to the standing peplos-figurine C17; it has a footstool and slender proportions recalling C74; its mixture of old and new elements is familiar in Corinthian coroplastic work. Two examples, however, thought to be Attic, were found in the excavations of the Pnyx in Athens, in a deposit dated to the late 4th century B.C.;150 they are so similar to the Corinthian figurine as to suggest a mechanical relationship. The fabric of the Athenian examples is burned; the soft, friable fabric of the Corinthian piece does not seem Attic. Either one or the other was an import, or the figurines were made in both places in parallel molds deriving from the same archetype, the origin of which is as yet unknown. C81, which would seem to represent a seated goddess but for the distorted feet, may be an example of a known Corinthian taste for parodying serious figurine types, perhaps stemming from the coarse humor sometimes associated with fertility cult (see p. 195). A better-preserved example of this genre in Berlin, thought to be from Corinth, shows an enthroned goddess with vessels (for receiving offerings?) at her feet, but she is corpulent and has grotesquely sagging breasts; her right hand rests on the knee in the usual hieratic pose, but the gesture is made humorous by baring the knee and placing an alabastron in her left hand, so that she seems to be rubbing her sore knee with ointment.151 C81 may be doing the same thing, and the distorted feet may be part of the humor. Similarly wide, splaying feet, although in a more normal pose, are found in other Early Classical figurines, such as the standing youth C188, as well as the parodies H368 and H374. On a smaller scale, C82-C85 carry the lingering Archaic seated goddess type into the 4th century B.C. in an updated form. This group is characterized by its small scale (size range 1- 2), blocklike, backless seat, and extended forearms. The mantle arrangement in this group falls over the lap and knees to a horizontal edge at mid-calf, covering the left shoulder and arm. C82 and C83 are typical representatives of this well-documented Corinthian group; better-preserved examples from elsewhere are bareheaded and hold various objects in their outstretched hands, including birds, small boxes, fruits or cakes (singly or on trays), fillets, and large balls.152 This array of objects suggests that the figurines represent women or girls offering gifts, rather than goddesses holding attributes. Since this type was popular and is known in a number of variants, it is conceivable that it reflects a point in the ritual when female participants were seated on benches, holding their offerings, before dedicating them to the goddesses. If this is true, C78 149 For a Boeotian example in Boston in fully Hellenistic style, see Coroplast's Art, p. 117, no. 10, with bibliography. 150 H. A. Thompson 1936, p. 170, no. lb, fig. 18.

Corinthian imports of this type were dedicated at the Thesmophorion in Eretria.153 Later variants of this group have their skirts spread out to cover the blocklike seats. Their more gently rounded forms, sloping shoulders, and demure appearance place them stylistically in the latter part of the 4th century B.C. C86, which may hold an aulos, is a good example from the Demeter sanctuary; other variants are known mainly from museum collections.154 Although no member of this group was found in the Potters' Quarter, the fabric and workmanship of C86 suggest that it was made there; in addition, two Potters' Quarter head molds show a similar face and coiffure, although they are larger.155 A much better made and larger version in the National Museum, Athens, holding a tray of cakes, also looks like a Potters' Quarter product.156 Perhaps one of the workshops there made a specialty of variations on the theme of seated goddesses and votaries. Several unusual figurines are seated in wicker chairs. In C90 and its more clearly detailed mold sibling from the Potters' Quarter,157 the rounded chair back, the details of the wicker wrapping visible behind the shoulders, and the structural strips in the back clearly belong to such a chair.158 The seats of C89 and probably of its mold sibling C88, have a conical base and rounded back comparable to Etruscan thrones.159 These rounded forms probably portray a flexible material such as wicker. It is conceivable that these figurines represent priestesses or other ritual participants, since the Rule of the Andanian Mysteries of Messenia prescribes curved wicker seats for the "sacred women.l60 C87 is a highly simplified seated figure, in which the projections of the chair back are rendered in one piece with the torso. The combination of a molded head with a flat, handmade body is typically Corinthian. The technique lingers from the Archaic period,l61 but the head is clearly Early Classical in style. These flat, handmade bodies persist even into the 4th century for hieratic types, as is shown byMF-1 in the Corinth collection (P1. 75), which utilizes an early-4th-century B.C. head type (see p. 46). The only group of seated female figurines of a clearly borrowed type is composed of C91, a closely similar piece in the Corinth collection, MF-8666 (P1. 75), and the related head C92. This type, with the mantle sweeping horizontally across the shoulders from front to back and covering the head, has parallels among Paestan figurines.162 The face, too, is West Greek in type, with its plump cheeks, strongly marked eyelids, pleasant expression, and large disc earrings.163 Possibly also borrowed, this time from Boeotia, is the type represented by C70,which wears a peplos of Severe style, comparable to the standing peplos-figurine C1. This seated type, characterized by a peplos with a waist-length overfold and a plain central panel flanked by vertical folds to the hips, ending in zigzags, is fairly widespread. Among the major production centers, it is known well in Rhodes164 and Athens. 165 There are three probable Boeotian imports of this type from the Demeter sanctuary, two torsos (see 143) and the head 144; there is another, 153 Eretria, pp. 29, 78, nos. 420-426, pl. 22. 154 E.g., Winter, Typen I, p. 86, no. 7, with a head similar to C158; Danish National Museum, p. 41, no. 363, pl. 43; British Museum I, pp. 261-262, no. 962, pl. 135.

Within the category of seated female figurines, the enormous range of Corinthian coroplastic work is demonstrable, from moldmade miniatures with little retouch, such as C82, to such statuettes as C93. The latter almost belongs to the realm of sculpture and may have been entirely handmade. It must be the work of a craftsman who was familiar with sculpture and who perhaps made models for work in other materials or in larger scale. In photographs, the statuette in its fragmentary state could pass for work in stone, and even in direct examination it has a rough- hewn quality, as if the artisan had stone in mind. A similar quality can be found in the handmade Hellenistic head H431 and in two probably handmade solid female statuettes in the Corinth collection.167 In fact, the closest parallels for C93 are to be found in stone sculpture. The deep, slanted fluting at the sides of the peplos overfold and the deeply pocketed fold looping to the ankle recall the Erechtheion caryatids in style. 168 The deep, U-shaped catenaries on the overfold, however, are found in other Corinthian work (C94) and seem to be a local stylistic element. Since the statuette was handmade, a date of manufacture, probably the later 5th century B.C., can be proposed on stylistic grounds. The fragments of the statuette were found scattered, but the pottery of one of the four lots involved has been dated to the 5th-4th centuries B.C. The type appears to have continued well into the 4th century B.C. in a moldmade version (C94), also fragmentary, but still recognizable by the deep catenaries on the overfold, the sloping lap, and the fold patterns around the legs. The large size and substance of this group suggests that one of the goddesses was represented, perhaps Demeter. The final and most tantalizing group, C95-C99, is thought to have been seated because its crowned head type is known in better-preserved, although smaller, seated figurines in Corinth and does not appear on any standing types. One such seated figurine is from the Potters' Quarter;169 another is MF- 1 (Pi. 75) in the Corinth collection, an enthroned goddess with a handmade body. 170 The heads of these figurines could represent later generations of the same or related mold series as the group from the Demeter sanctuary. A head mold from the Potters' Quarter also is similar in facial type and coiffure.171 MF-1 is seated on a separately made throne; C95, with no traces of a chair back, may have been similarly composed or placed on a backless seat. The group seems to represent the final stylistic renewal in the 4th century B.C. of the traditional seated goddess type. The first four members of this group, C95-C98, must be from the same workshop; the first three of these, which wear a low crown, can be assigned to the same hand, to judge from the retouch, especially the use of a particular tool, perhaps a broken reed (see catalogue). The facial type recognizably descends from the earlier hydriaphoros group, C53-C56. In the best mold impression, that of C98, the face is more oval than its predecessors, although still long and rather straight sided; the forehead is higher; the temples slope toward the back of the head, so that the face loses the flat, uniplanar look of the 5th-century B.C. hydriaphoroi; and the jaw is more softly rounded. The eyes are still large but now are slightly downturned; the nose remains large and close to the upper lip; the lips are still unsmiling but are more mobile and slightly pursed. There is a general resemblance to heads of the more developed hydriaphoros group (C60 and C61), although these heads retain more of the 5th-century B.C. formal strength. The wide coiffure is still 166 Shoe 1932, p. 59, fig. 3. 167 MF-3973, MF-5545, Corinth XII, p. 41, nos. 222, 223, pl. 18; Coroplast's Art, p. 58, figs. 45, 46; also handmade are MF-7395, MF-7393, MF-7394, Corinth XII, p. 53, nos. 361- 363, pl. 32, a dog, a goat, and a tree. 168 Lauter 1976, e.g., Kore D, pp. 24-27, pl. 33. 169 KT-8-8, Corinth XV, ii, p. 127, no. 29, pl. 26. 170 Similar figurines, not all of stated Corinthian prove- nience but seeming to belong to this group, are Winter, Typen I, p. 87, no. 2; Konigliche Museen, pp. 11-12, pl.

The goddess has a remote, rather reserved look. A reasonable stylistic date for this head type is the early 4th century B.C. The fruit, probably a pomegranate, in the lap of MF-1 (PI. 75) and the fruits in her hands suggest that she represents Kore, although the pomegranate, apart from its obvious mythological link to Kore, can be an attribute of other goddesses, including Aphrodite.172 On the basis of the connection to MF-1 and others in this group, the heads from the Demeter sanctuary also may represent one of the goddesses, although the heads without the crown (C98 and C99) could have been used for other purposes. The low crown of C96 is surmounted by a row of oval or round pellets. These call to mind the crown of MF-1, to which three discs were attached; the central disc is now missing, but the others are stamped with a floral pattern.173 Figurines from Medma wear similar headdresses.l74 In these figurines, the crown takes the form of a very thick, rounded fillet, topped by either discs or what appear to be pointed leaves. If these crowns were floral, the discs may have been intended to be rosettes, with painted details. One figurine from Medma wearing such a crown, a seated goddess accompanied by two erotes, must represent Aphrodite.175 Since flowers are known as attributes of both Kore and Aphrodite (see p. 125), a floral crown, if that is what it is, would have been a suitable headdress for either goddess. It may be significant that a similar, although still further schematized crown is worn later by Aphrodite, in a Tarentine type of the 3rd century B.C. 76 A head that bears some relation to this group is C 100. As far as the head is preserved, it seems to belong stylistically to the later 4th century B.C. Its poor state of preservation is unfortunate, since it is the only head of its period known to have worn a high, crenellated polos. V14-V15 are larger examples of this type of headdress, broken from their figurines; they are decorated with figured reliefs (see pp. 270-271). In a rather unstable composition, the heavy headdress of C100 is perched on the tilted head, supported only by the slender neck. It is unclear with which of the preserved torso types, if any, this head is to be associated, although it must represent one of the goddesses. If it belonged to a seated figure, the likeliest candidate in terms of scale would be a late version of C94. A standing Persephone from Morgantina, dated within the first half of the 3rd century B.C., has a similar facial type and coiffure, although the headdress is lower and is covered by a veil.177 C101 is similar to C100 in the coiffure, earrings, and to some extent the headdress, which is a high stephane rather than a polos but with a notched border; perhaps the intention was to portray a headdress like that of C96 or C100. The pottery contexts are, as usual, only partially helpful. The comic figure C81 is from a pottery context terminating at least in the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. An uncatalogued head wearing a polos (MF- 11726) belongs to a pottery lot terminating in the early 4th century B.C.; it is close in type to C73 (see catalogue), the earliest head type found on the Classical seated figurines, but it is from a different mold series. The usable pottery contexts of the seated figurines terminate at the latest in the early 3rd century B.C. Once again, the demise of the Potters' Quarter workshops in or near the 320s B.C. must have been an important contributing factor, leaving a gap in production to be filled by other workshops with a different repertoire. 172 Muthmann 1982, pp. 39-52 on Aphrodite. 173 The discs are better preserved on the example from Delphi: Szabo 1994, pp. 95, 148, fig. 119. 174 Orsi 1913, figs. 126, 135-137, on pls. following p. 108. 175Orsi 1917, pp. 60-61, fig. 36. 176 In San Francisco, Coroplast's Art, p. 157, no. 44. 77 Morgantina, p. 133, no. 60, pl. 15.</page><page sequence="72">48 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS ISOLATED FEMALE HEADS (C102-C104) Among the heads lacking a clear association with any of the groups discussed above, two are of strong outside inspiration: C103 and C104 depend upon Rhodian and Attic prototypes respectively. C103 either could have been copied directly from a Rhodian draped female figurine178 or could owe its style to Rhodes indirectly, as a descendant of a Rhodian-inspired protome of a type found in the Potters' Quarter.179 C104 is of a widespread type known, for example, from Rhodes,l80 Boeotia (see import 144), and Athens, where it probably originated. Although no imports of this type have been found in Corinth, it was at least exported to the region, since three fine Attic examples were found in Argos.181 The modeling of the Corinthian head is so slack that its mold could have been taken directly from an Attic figurine. C102 has a Sicilian connection in the coiffure, which is bound with a kerchief,l82 but its long, large-featured face falls within the stylistic range of Corinthian Classical types. It may have belonged to a standing peplos-figurine, as do its Sicilian parallels. Of the three heads in this category, only C102 is from a chronologically useful pottery context, dating to the first half of the 4th century B.C. ARTICULATED "DOLLS," RELATED HEADS, AND RELATED FIGURINES OF DANCERS (C105-C185) Articulated "dolls" of the Classical period, found in small numbers elsewhere in Corinth, have been published in earlier excavation reports,183 but the enormous quantity found at the Demeter sanctuary allows a much better understanding of their development. Although only a small, representative sampling can be provided in publication, the observations offered here are based on the whole body of material. These figurines are well known in Greece, where they were made at least as early as the Geometric period. Whether they ever actually functioned as children's toys is uncertain, but the term "doll" is fixed in the scholarly literature and therefore is retained here. They are characterized by freely moving arms and legs or, in the case of seated "dolls" and "dolls" with rigid legs, only moving arms. Some were pegged at the top of the head to allow them to dangle from the hand of the owner. Since the limbs were attached to the torsos with perishable cords, no complete examples were found in the sanctuary, but a reasonably accurate count can be taken by using the torsos alone. Because most of the torsos are solid or very thick-walled, they often are preserved intact and are easily recognizable among the figurines. Of the approximately 930 torsos counted, the larger proportion, about 810, are nude; the remainder wear a knee-length chiton or peplos.184 Although most of the Corinthian "dolls" belong to the later 5th and 4th centuries B.C., they were made from the Late Archaic period onward. The lingering Archaic "dolls" (see p. 23, note 1) are solid, single-molded or handmade plaques; some wear a chitoniskos and polos, while a few are schematically nude. Such "dolls" continued in use through the 5th century B.C., but new double- molded types were created afresh, a nude version by the third quarter of the 5th century B.C. and a draped one perhaps a quarter-century later, to judge from the drapery style. 178 Cf. the heads of such Rhodian figurines as British Mu- seum I, pp. 83-84, nos. 210-213, pl. 37. 179 KT-11-7, Corinth XV, ii, p. 101, no. 18, pl. 19. 180 E.g., British Museum I, pp. 85-86, no. 223, pl. 38. 181 Daux 1968, pp. 1028, 1034, fig. 20. 182 E.g., Gabrici 1927, col. 290, pl.

The numbered classification suggested in Corinth XV, ii, does not work well for the larger repertoire of variants now known, and therefore it is not used here. 184 "Dolls"' heads were not always pierced for suspension (e.g., C128) and therefore cannot be counted as accurately as torsos.</page><page sequence="73">DISCUSSION 49 Several uses and meanings have been proposed for the "dolls," most of which represent young women. A summary of published interpretations follows.185 At the simplest level they are thought to have been toys and sometimes to have been dressed in bits of cloth, although this idea is based on an apparently incorrect emendation of the epigram Anthologia Palatina 6.280.186 They may have been among the toys dedicated at shrines when approaching adulthood and marriage required a symbolic leaving behind of childish pleasures, although the correction of the above-mentioned epigram weakens this interpretation, for which there is no other evidence. When represented in the hands of girls on Attic grave reliefs, they are always nude and have been interpreted convincingly as anatomical votives for a successful puberty.187 The discovery of "dolls" in the graves of adults points to a chthonic connection or an apotropaic function. The violent movement of which the articulated "dolls" were capable when shaken may have served as a charm. The "dolls"' nudity suggests that sometimes they may have represented hetairai; while there are numerous nude goddess figurines of Geometric and Archaic date,188 in Classical Greek art, female nudity was generally confined to representations of hetairai, particularly in vase painting.189 The elaborate coiffures and caps with high, hornlike projections worn by some of the "dolls" have been considered apotropaic. Some "dolls" (although none from the Demeter sanctuary) hold krotala and were therefore meant to represent dancers; the knee-length peplos or skirt worn by some also can be associated with dancers. Given so many choices, all of them appropriate in one way or another to the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, it is rather difficult to define specific functions for articulated "dolls" in Corinth. The precise cultic associations of various Greek figurine types are likely to have been a local matter, depending less on any universal significance than on the functions of the shrines in which they were dedicated. Since it is likely that both human and agricultural fertility were celebrated at the Demeter sanctuary, it can be expected that such a large group of votives as the "dolls" served more than one purpose there, the type of"doll" selected for the offering presumably determined by the votary's needs. Some "dolls" from the Demeter sanctuary hold offerings and therefore may represent votaries. In the hand of C 121 is a long, thin cake, similar to offerings on model likna from the sanctuary. 190 The hand V21, which may possibly belong to a "doll," holds a similar long cake together with one shaped like a disc. In the hand of C122 is a similar disc. On the analogy of the krotala held by some "dolls," such discs have been thought to represent tambourines191 or cymbals,l92 but since they resemble in shape cakes on the model likna,193 they probably should be so identified, at least at the Acrocorinth sanctuary; here the carrying of cakes may point to the hope of agricultural abundance from Demeter. If the "dolls"' elaborate coiffures were indeed apotropaic and their movement served as a charm, fear of death could have motivated some of the offerings, assuming that they were brought to Kore as the Queen of the Underworld. Since Kore is the quintessential bride in myth, some of the "dolls" could have been offered to her by girls of marriageable age as symbolically relinquished toys of childhood, if such they were, or more likely, since they are nude, 185 On the subject, see Elderkin 1930; Andren 1948, pp. 61- 64 (on both dangling and seated "dolls"); Pnyx, pp. 114- 118; Dorig 1958; Troy, pp. 87-95 (on seated "dolls"); Zuntz 1971, pp. 168-170; Vandenabeele 1971-1972 (Corinthian type, pp. 38-40, incorrectly assigned to Boeotia); R. Schmidt 1977, pp. 115-128 (on "dolls" as toys); Aspects of Ancient Greece, p. 244 (on "dolls" as apotropaic objects); Morgantina, pp. 94-96 (on seated "dolls"); Pergamon, pp. 56-59 (where many seated "dolls" were found in the vicinity of the Demeter sanctuary); Redfield 1991; Nicholls 1995, pp. 435-438. 186 In the correct reading, according to Daux (1973), Tima- reta dedicates not her dolls and their dresses but her hair and her own clothing. 87 Reilly 1997. 188 Bohm 1990. 189 Bonfante 1989, p. 559. 190 Cf.

For discs as musical instruments, see Meyers 1987. 192 Elderkin 1930, pp. 461-463, fig. 9. 193 These cakes seem to be larger than the flat, round kollyba (Brumfield 1997, pp. 149-150); they probably correspond with the popana (ibid., p. 150), but without knobs.</page><page sequence="74">50 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS as expressions of physical maturity and the fertility of approaching marriage. Because the draped "dolls" represent dancers (see pp. 58-60), the connection with fertility is strengthened, since dancing is frequently associated with fertility cult. The nudity of most of the "dolls," and the elaborately peaked coiffures and caps associated with hetairai worn by some of them, could have had special significance in Corinth, the only city in Greece to have adopted ritual prostitution from the Near East. This factor is considered further in a later chapter discussing the role of Aphrodite at the sanctuary (see pp. 169-172), since it is possible that some of the "dolls" were dedicated to her. TORSOS AND LIMBS OF ARTICULATED "DOLLS" (C105-C 123) The largest and best made of the nude double-molded "dolls" is C105. The completely hollow, thin-walled construction of this figurine gave way gradually, first to a still hollow but thicker-walled construction, as in C106, then to a nearly solid form, which became the standard type. Perhaps the greater weight of the solid "dolls" allowed them to dangle and dance better and was considered an advantage. There must have been a reason for the change in technique, since solid "dolls" used much more material and must have been more difficult to fire thoroughly. In the solid "dolls," the inner surface of each half, after unmolding, was sometimes prepared for joining with a slight indentation or hollowing at the center, so that only the edges joined, in a sort of coroplastic anathyrosis (see C107). In smaller and sometimes less carefully made examples, the inner surfaces were left flat but were scored roughly (see C109). After joining the two halves, probably with a thin clay solution, a socket was hollowed between the shoulders for insertion of the neck. Sockets also were hollowed in the thighs, and the knees were pierced through from side to side with an awl or pin. After firing, a cord on which the lower legs hung was threaded through the sockets. The shoulders also were pierced, often completely through from side to side, penetrating the neck dowel; after firing, a cord was threaded through to attach the arms, or they were tied to small (wooden?) pegs driven into the holes. Sometimes the molds were furnished at the bottom with three flanges instead of thigh sockets, as in C108; the flanges also were pierced through from side to side. This technique was also used for the lingering Archaic "dolls" (see p. 23, note 1). Front and back molds of flanged "dolls" were found in the Potters' Quarter.l94 This mechanism made unnecessary the hollowing of the thighs and became standard in 4th-century B.C. "dolls." Flanged attachment of the legs is less attractive than the socketed form, which hides the joint, but flanges allow freer movement of the legs. In the latest and poorest examples, the flanges were at least in part made by hand, perhaps because they were lost from the molds as the mold series progressed and degenerated; as a result, the piercing of the side flanges is sometimes higher than the central flange (e.g., C113), and at the very end of a mold series, the legs may have been hung from only a central flange (e.g., C114). Limbs of articulated "dolls" are either handmade or moldmade; generally speaking, the smaller limbs are handmade, and while it has not been possible to connect limbs with their original torsos, it is likely that the later, smaller, and poorer "dolls" had handmade limbs. Presumably, molds for the limbs were no longer available. Molds for legs of articulated "dolls," and possibly an arm, were found in the Potters' Quarter; two of the leg molds had offset flanges at the top for piercing, as in C 116 and C117.195 Most legs, however, were simply flattened and thinned at the top before piercing, as in C 118 and C 119. Both methods simplified insertion of the legs into thigh sockets or between thigh flanges. The offset type may have been intended for socketed rather than flanged torsos, although this cannot be proven. It is, however, very likely that the offset type is earlier, since these legs sometimes have carefully modeled anatomical details (e.g., C1 17), while the flattened type often has a more simply made, undetailed foot or a pointed shoe (e.g., C 118 and 194 KH-65, KH-66, Corinth XV, i, p. 106, nos. 66, 67, pl. 41. 195 KH-68-KH-71, Corinth XV, i, pp. 106-107, nos. 69-72, pl. 42; nos. 69 and 70 are legs with offset flanges.</page><page sequence="75">DISCUSSION 51 C119). The preserved arms either are bent at the elbow (e.g., C121 and C122) or are short and straight (e.g., C123).196 The mitten-shaped hand is standard, occasionally with painted details preserved representing fingers and jewelry. 197 "Dolls"' heads and necks usually were doweled into the shoulders, although a few poor and late examples were simply glued onto a scored surface at the top of the torso (e.g., C184). The heads were usually strictly frontal in pose, presumably to enable the figurine to dangle properly, but a few are tilted slightly (e.g., C142, C152). It is remarkable how the seemingly expressionless features of "dolls" come to life when the heads are bent a little. The tops of the heads of dangling "dolls" were pierced for suspension; heads that were not pierced (e.g., C128) could have belonged to seated "dolls" or to standing "dolls" with rigid legs, such as C110. The holes in the heads are usually larger than those in the shoulders or knees, ca. 0.004-0.007 in diameter, and are sometimes very deep, cutting vertically into the neck tenon and even into the chest in smaller "dolls." Perhaps the holes are deep because sturdy pegging would have been needed to hold the weight of the dangling "dolls."198 There is no evidence among the "dolls" from the Demeter sanctuary for the use of a metal suspension ring in the head. The "dolls" range downward in scale from size range 4-5 (e.g., the leg C116) to size range 1-2 (e.g., C113), that is, from statuettes to miniatures. The smallest torso found, in lot 6638, is only 0.04 in height; C170 and C171 are examples of the smallest "dolls"' heads. Some of the smallest may not have come from the end of a mold series but rather may have been independent copies of small "dolls" in other materials, such as bone or ivory.199 Surprisingly, the pierced head with melon coiffure C136 shows that large "dolls" were still being made in Hellenistic times, unless the hole served another purpose. Although it is virtually impossible to follow completely the mold series of the nude torsos or to determine how many series there were, owing to the lack of anatomical detail in most of the "dolls," a few observations can be made. The largest and best-made "doll's" torso (C105) is characterized by a subtle anatomical modeling stylistically datable to ca. 440-430 B.C., on the basis of comparison with the sculptured "Stumbling Niobid" in Rome.200 This figurine may have been followed by only one more generation. The present evidence does not link C105 with the "dolls" next in size and quality (e.g., C106 and C108), which seem to have had an archetype with a more slender and geometrically organized anatomy. This phenomenon is known in Corinth for other figurine types as well, since the largest, most original, and best-made pieces sometimes were copied at a smaller scale in other workshops; the repetitive mold series evolved from these smaller and presumably cheaper copies, rather than from the original, finer creations. The rather masculine anatomy of the torsos of the smaller "dolls" recalls kouroi of the Ptoon 20 group, but with the bulge of the iliac crest suppressed.201 It should not necessarily be concluded, however, that the type actually originated in the Archaic period, since the artisans may have made use of workshop materials at hand, adapting an available male torso by adding breasts. For artisans in terracotta who had to create a nude female torso, the nude male torso was an obvious starting point or shortcut.202 Alternatively, the coroplasts may have been trying to convey the androgynous quality of a very young woman, whose femininity was just emerging. 196 Complete "dolls" in museum collections may have been assembled from parts belonging to different figurines and are not necessarily helpful in assigning limb types to torsos. 197 E.g., KT-13-28, Corinth XV, ii, p. 150, no. 20, pl. 31. 198 For a representation on a grave relief of a girl holding a doll by its head string, see Dorig 1958, pl. 23:3. 199 For such "dolls," see Pnyx, pp. 110-111, no. 6, fig. 49; Elderkin 1930, pp. 467-468, fig. 18; Olynthus X, pp. 15-17, nos. 9, 10, figs. 2, 3; Muller-Wiener et al. 1980, pp. 54-55, pl. 26:5-7, from Miletos. 200 In the Terme Museum: Boardman 1985, pp. 175, 177, fig. 133:1, with bibliography on p. 245; Ridgway 1981a, pp. 55-57, fig. 25. 201 Cf.

The flanges originally may have been handmade additions to the thighs of a socketed torso, copying the flanges of lingering Archaic articulated "dolls" (see p. 23, note 1). The size difference between C106 and C108 is 0.025 (not including neck and flanges), indicating that if these torsos belong to the same or related mold series, C108 would be a generation later. If the flanges were indeed handmade additions, as suggested, this alteration would have taken place in the earlier of the two generations. Thereafter, socketed-leg "dolls" continued for at least one more generation (there is another 0.02 decrease in size to C109), before being replaced altogether by flanged-leg "dolls." It has been suggested elsewhere that "dolls" with socketed legs are a particularly Attic type, while those with flanged legs are Corinthian.203 Although undoubtedly there are connections between Attic and Corinthian "dolls," the nature of the relationship is not entirely clear. That the two centers knew each other's "doll" types is certain. An apparently Attic copy of a flat-backed lingering Archaic Corinthian "doll" was found in the Athenian Agora,204 while an Attic "doll" of limbless type (P1. 75) was found in a 4th-century B.C. context in Corinth.205 When the thighs of these Attic limbless figurines terminate in sockets, they are not pierced for the attachment of lower legs,206 and some, such as the above-mentioned example from Corinth, are not really socketed but are completely open underneath. Published Attic "dolls" with pierced thigh sockets are of later anatomical style than their Corinthian counterparts207 and therefore on the basis of present evidence cannot be cited as sources. Further finds and studies may clarify the matter, but at present it is probably best not to assign geographical origins to the different methods of attaching limbs. Shoulders with flat surfaces for the attachment of the arms are the norm in the largest and best "dolls." In others, the torso curves in gently at the waist (e.g., C109), and, as a result, the shoulders project slightly. Other examples, which are smaller and later, show angular, projecting shoulders almost like those of a herm (e.g., C127). Since a tendency to projecting shoulders is seen even in the flat lingering Archaic "dolls,"208 it is probably not entirely a chronological development but in part a device to free the arms as much as possible when the "doll" was in movement. Flat shoulders continue to be found in the Hellenistic period among seated "dolls."209 A small number of "dolls," both standing and seated, have moveable arms but rigid legs. One such standing "doll" is represented on a grave relief in Athens,210 and the type may have been more typically Attic than Corinthian. The best-preserved Corinthian example is C110, which is later in date, having the attenuated proportions of the Hellenistic period. It may have been made in the same workshop as a seated "doll" with similar rigid legs in the Corinth collection; this "doll," which also resembles C110 in proportions and workmanship, is from a 3rd- to early-2nd-century B.C. deposit.211 203 Corinth XV, ii, pp. 147-148. 204 Nicholls 1995, p. 483, no. 63, pl. 106, with further imported examples cited on p. 436, note 148. 205 MF-71-45, from Forum Southwest; for the deposit, Drain 1971-1, see C. K. Williams and Fisher 1972, pp. 154- 163 (several figurines noted on pp. 162-163). The context is dated to the third quarter of the 4th century B.C.; since the figurines are otherwise consistently 4th century in date, it is possible that the Attic limbless "dolls" survived well into that period. 206 For a photograph of the underside of this type, see Vafopoulou-Richardson 1981, fig. 15.

The construction of this "doll" is not very clear in the relief, but the arms do seem to swing forward, and the legs seem to be pressed together. 211 MF-2751, Corinth XII, p. 41, no. 224, pl. 19. Standing dolls with rigid legs are not very common in Corinth. A late-5th-century B.C. example in London has less elongated proportions: British Museum I, p. 259, no. 953, pl. 134.</page><page sequence="77">DISCUSSION 53 The rigid lower legs of the fragmentary Clll could have belonged to a standing "doll," but the clean horizontal break at the knees suggests that the legs may have broken from the flat lap of a seated nude "doll." This type, also of Hellenistic date,212 is more common in Corinth than standing "dolls" with rigid legs, but in general it is more typical of Central Greece and Asia Minor.213 A more unusual type of seated "doll," probably of 4th-century B.C. date, is represented by C112 and the leg C120. The legs of these "dolls" were made in two parts, articulated at both the hip and the knee.214 "Dolls" so constructed could sit or, if the head were pierced, could dangle; the back wall drops to the bottom of the flanges, probably to provide stability on a seat. In the latest "dolls," distortions in the anatomy appear to be the result of carelessness, as in C114, although the corpulence of one example (C115) must be deliberate, a parallel to nonarticulated comic figurines parodying serious types (see pp. 196-197). Obese female figurines with articulated arms have been found elsewhere, but they usually have rigid legs and stand on bases; they are thought to represent hetairai.215 HEADS OF ARTICULATED "DOLLS" AND RELATED HEADS (C124-C171) Heads of "dolls," even when not attached to a torso, can be recognized in part by their characteristic facial and coiffure types but most reliably by the suspension hole at the top. Sometimes, in fact, it is only the holes that identify them, since the molds were used so often, and the casts consequently were so blurred, that some "dolls"' heads are little more than pierced terracotta lumps. Presumably in these cases the lack of detail was remedied with paint. As mentioned above, however, not every "doll's" head was pierced. The best example of an unpierced "doll's" head is C128, which is preserved with the upper part of a flat-shouldered "doll's" torso. This head and torso may have belonged to a fully articulated "doll" that did not dangle, to a "doll" with rigid legs in a seated or standing pose, or perhaps to one with two-part legs, such as C 112, which could either stand or sit.216 While this unpierced head certainly belonged to a "doll" of one sort or another, other heads, now separated from their torsos, originally may have belonged not to "dolls" but to other figurine types, even when they are mechanically related to "dolls"' heads. Heads often were used indiscriminately for different kinds of figurines; in accord with this workshop practice, stylistically or mechanically related pierced and unpierced heads are discussed together in this chapter. The great variety among "dolls"' heads, not only in scale, quality, and workmanship but also in the combinations of facial types, coiffures, and headdresses, precludes a strict division into categories. For this reason, a representative sample has been selected for cataloguing and discussion. The 5th-century B.C. "dolls"' heads are characterized by a curly, rounded mass of hair wrapped in a sphendone, which is fastened at the top with a soft, flat bowknot, an arrangement that persists and is elaborated upon into the 4th century B.C. The forehead is framed by a row of fat ringlets; the face is usually small, with a narrow, receding chin. Both the ringlets and the receding chin seem to be Archaic survivals. The features are always blurred, perhaps because worn head molds were the basis for new designs. A head of this type (C125) was found in Pit A 212 MF-2751, MF-2753, MF-2754, Corinth XII, p. 41, nos. 224-226, pl. 19, from a 3rd- to early-2nd-century B.C. deposit; also, MF-3088, MF-9311 in the Corinth collection. A 3rd- to 2nd-century B.C. tomb in Argos contained a similar "doll": Aupert 1982, pp. 642-643, fig. 9. 213 Andren 1948, pp. 61-64; Troy, pp. 87-95, both with bibliography. 214 There is a complete example of this type in Copenhagen (Danish National Museum, p. 60, no. 562, pl. 70). The reported provenience is Tanagra, but the "doll" could be Corinthian, since its head is similar to C132; the arms and lower legs, however, do not seem typically Corinthian. In any case, it is not certain that any of the limbs originally belonged to this torso. 215 Winter, Typen II, p. 456, nos. 2, 3; Lindos I, col. 578, no. 2387, pl. 112; from the Athenian Agora, D. B. Thompson 1954, pp. 90-91, 106, no. 2, pl. 21, with bibliography. 216 A parallel for this "doll" type in Copenhagen seems to have an unpierced head, since no hole is mentioned in the description: Danish National Museum, p. 60, no. 562, pl. 70; this seems not to be an oversight, since another "doll" in the collection, p. 29, no. 270, is described as pierced.</page><page sequence="78">54 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS (lot 887), the terminal date of which is the last quarter of the 5th century B.C. Although this head type was not found in the Potters' Quarter, it may have been made there, since it was used on torsos with projecting shoulders (see C124), molds for which were found in the Potters' Quarter. In 4th-century B.C. examples of this head type, a towering, columnar projection of hair sometimes was added to the cranium (C126). A larger and much better made version of a head wearing a bow-tied sphendone, C130, could be an example of the type that gave rise to this popular series. The head is not pierced, and there is no observable mechanical link between it and the "doll" type from Pit A, but it could have belonged to a large (size range 3) "doll." It has the long, straight-sided, full-jawed facial shape and large features typical of the Early Classical hydriaphoros group (see pp. 39-40). Another, similar head (C131) has a less narrow facial shape. Both heads show more softly rendered features than the hydriaphoros group and a more gently flowing coiffure, suggesting a somewhat later stylistic development. They retain a certain seriousness of expression, however, accentuated by their unsmiling mouths. In both heads, the sphendone bow was not added but was included in the mold, indicating that the archetypes of these heads may have been intended specifically for "dolls," the only type definitely known among the sanctuary finds to utilize this headdress. The pottery context of C131 dates to the 5th century B.C.; its architectural context is probably of late-4th-century B.C. date. A reasonable stylistic date for the archetype of these heads would be the middle to third quarter of the 5th century B.C. In the facial structure and waving forehead hair, these heads have a parallel in a sculpture from the Athenian Agora, a Pheidian head of Nike, which is a Roman replica related to the Hertz type.217 The fleshier facial features of the figurines, however, are more Peloponnesian than Attic in style. It is possible that we can see once again a familiar pattern, in which a type developed in Corinth during the 5th century B.C. outside the Potters' Quarter was adapted there in a more modest form and mass produced into the 4th century B.C. C134-C136 appear to be later, coarsened versions of this facial type. The coiffures of C134 and C135 are detailed, but abstractly, without a real understanding of the hair arrangement. C136 wears the Hellenistic melon coiffure; its relatively large size demonstrates that late "dolls" are not necessarily small "dolls" at the end of mold series. Two pierced "dolls"' heads, C140 and C141, are descendants, typologically and perhaps also mechanically, of the hydriaphoros type with a long, narrow face. The coroplast of C141 added a rough sphendone with a slashed bowknot but clearly no longer understood how the sphendone bound up the hair, for he added long locks of hair at the sides as well. In C140, the features have lost their definition, and the figurine wears a flat, round hat that resembles a petasos more than the sun hats worn by women, as seen in "Tanagra" figurines; the head therefore may have belonged to a male "doll," although no male articulated torsos of this period have survived. Both heads probably were made during the second half of the 4th century B.C. The foregoing heads reflect 5th-century B.C. creations, although they were made in the 4th century B.C., but "dolls"' heads of a genuine 4th-century style were made at the same time. In some, the long facial shape is retained, although rounded a little at the sides or tapered somewhat toward the chin. The face loses its uniplanar structure entirely, the forehead becomes higher, the temples slant back more, and the eyes drop down at the outer corners and diminish in size in relation to the face. Sometimes the height of the forehead and the depth of the jaw force the features into a cluster near the center of the face. The serious expression usually persists. Individual heads show these qualities to different degrees, some maintaining a more Classical look, others leaning toward a growing Hellenistic expressiveness. The "anti-Classicism" recognized in 4th-century sculptural style218 seems to have coexisted peacefully with survivals of Classical 217 Harrison 1982, pp. 53-65. 218 Brown 1973, pp. 5-24.</page><page sequence="79">DISCUSSION 55 style, as a normal feature of figurine production in Corinth, just as in the 5th century B.C. and even into the 4th, Archaic traditions and Classical innovations coexisted. Among the more Classical heads are C128, C132, C133, and C137-C139, one of which (C138) is from a pottery context terminating in the mid-4th century B.C. In their faces, a slight downturn of the eyes at the outer corners is coupled with the impassiveness typical of the Classical heads. Only one head (C132) is slightly expressive, owing in part to its slight tilt on a powerful neck. The long hair in back and the pellet earrings recall the head of the peplos-figurine C17, suggesting that C 132 may have belonged to a figurine of that type. Even if not itselfa "doll's" head, C132 may have a later mechanical relative in the pierced head C133, to which a bowknotted sphendone and a towering projection of hair have been added, as in C126. Another group with an early-4th-century B.C. stylistic date is C142-C144, all large (size ranges 3-4 or 4) and well made. Of the three heads, only C142 is pierced. The relationship among them is hard to define, since they are not mechanically related and differ in some ways. In all, the front hair is waved from a central part in the Knidian fashion. C142 has precisely modeled parallel hair waves, suggesting a metallic source, while the rendering is much freer and more typical of work in clay in the other two heads. The deep, broadly waved locks of C 144 recall a stone sculpture, a female head from the Argive Heraion.219 C143 differs in the binding of the hair in back in a sakkos. All share a particular beauty of fabric, which must have been achieved only with considerable effort, even though the surface would have been hidden completely by layers of slip and paint. In fact, the outlines of the features are in part obscured because the slip and paint adhered very well to the carefully prepared surface. There are traces of yellow on the hair of C 142, probably an underpainting for gilding (see pp. 13-14). These heads represent the very best of the local coroplasts' craft. None of the three is part of a long mold series or even has a clear mechanical relative among the other heads. Just as in the peplos-figurine category, the best work is isolated, and we are probably dealing with a workshop, located outside the Potters' Quarter, that did not mass produce figurines. As before, one must assume in these cases either that the best-made, most sculpturally oriented figurines were prohibitively expensive or that the economic base of their workshops rested on activities other than the production of large quantities of figurines, such as the preparation of models for bronze statuettes. A few pieces show a fine finish of a different kind. C129 was painted in three stages. First a thin bluish white wash was applied, then a thick white slip, and over this an enamel-like ivory- colored paint. In addition, the jewelry was gilded. The same piece shows an unusually delicate handling of the hair. The peaked coiffure so carefully detailed in C129, however, is given such a summary rendering in C 155 that the hair is rendered with vertical incised strokes, without regard for its natural pattern of growth. Peaked coiffures first appear in Attic art in the 5th century B.C. and were popular ca. 360 B.C., on the basis of their appearance on grave stelai of this time.220 A group of heads in a more Attic style (C 145-C148) shows oval to round faces with trian- gular foreheads and coiffures that are peaked in front. Similar heads are found on Attic figurine vases, such as a lekythos in Berlin representing Aphrodite and Adonis.221 A number of Attic figurine vases of the late 5th and 4th centuries B.C. are of reported Corinthian provenience;222 if this information is accurate, such vases could have been available to Corinthian coroplasts. The Corinthian heads are too large to have been made in molds taken directly from Attic figurine vases, however, and too small to have been taken from Attic head vases, but imported Attic vases could have inspired free copies. Alternatively, Attic molds could have been used. Attic workshop materials were exported to Asia Minor and Egypt,223 and it is conceivable that 219 Cf. especially the hair in the profile view in Berve et al. 1962, pl. 84. 220 Pnyx, pp. 120, 143, no. 43, fig. 58. 221 Trumpf-Lyritzaki 1969, pp. 49-50, no. 137, pl. 20. 222 Trumpf-Lyritzaki 1969, nos. 25, 34, 47, 48, 49, 104, 137, 161, 167. 223 Besques 1978; Kassab Tezgor and Abd al Fattah 1997.</page><page sequence="80">56 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS Corinth received some as well, although no examples have been recognized as yet among the molds found in Corinth. A head closely similar to C145 is found on an articulated "doll" with socketed legs in Bowdoin College.224 Another facial type with an Attic parallel is C149, the style of which compares well with a late-5th- to early-4th-century B.C. head vase from the Athenian Agora.225 Since these long, narrow faces, now with a somewhat mournful expression because of their tilted pose, parted lips, and downturned eyes, are more typical of earlier Corinthian style than Attic, one might suggest a common Corinthian ancestry. Once again, the relationship is stylistic rather than demonstrably mechanical. One group of heads (C149-C152) demonstrates the close workshop relationship between "dolls"' heads and heads used for other figurine types. The rough tooling on the hair of C149 is so similar to that of the peplos-figurine C17 as to imply that they were made in the same workshop (Workshop B, pp. 344-345) in the Potters' Quarter; C149 has long hair bound with a fillet, a coiffure more characteristic of peplos-figurines than "dolls." Also from the same workshop are C150 and C151. C150 is probably of the generation following C149; it shows the same slashing technique for hair retouch but a different coiffure, this time with the locks of hair tied at the top of the head into a flat bowknot with four protruding curls. A trace of a drapery fold at the neck suggests that this head belonged to a mantled figurine, and in fact the head is closely similar in facial type and coiffure to that of a Corinthian mantled figurine in London; this head wears a wreath of leaves.226 C151 may be yet another generation, now pierced as a "doll's" head, with very similar hair retouch, but the bowknot altered to a loose cluster of curls. Since coiffures with knotted hair-locks and clusters of curls first appeared in Corinth in the latter part of the 4th century B.C. (see pp. 161-162), these heads would have been among the later products of the workshop, before the destruction of the Potters' Quarter in the 320s B.C. This small group of heads is an interesting illustration of workshop practice. With a similar technique indicating that they were made within a relatively short time, perhaps by the same artisan, they represent three generations of a mold series, probably used for three completely different figurine types, a peplos-figurine, a mantled figurine, and an articulated "doll," all with different coiffures. Still another head in this workshop group is C152, probably a mold sibling of the head of the peplos-figurine C17, but it is a pierced "doll's" head, with yet another coiffure, this time plaited. Also related is a head from the Potters' Quarter, perhaps from a parallel mold series.227 One element that remains constant throughout the group is the pair of teardrop-shaped earrings. In the later generations, the forehead increases in height and width and, as a result, the features seem to cluster near the center of the face. Two larger heads also are related in facial type and coiffure. C154 shows some similarity in workmanship, but its facial features are stronger and the cheeks and jaw are fuller. The tendency to cluster features at the center of the face is exaggerated in C153, which has a flowing coiffure like that of C149. Other "dolls"' heads as well have possible workshop relationships outside their types. C156, for example, may be a mechanical relative of the head of the mantled figurine H102 and a head with a bow-knot coiffure (H234). Although a few groups have been described above, most of the "dolls," particularly the more summary, mass-produced examples, do not fall into a coherent pattern. The coroplasts probably possessed head molds descending from a variety of types, which they mixed indiscriminately with different torsos and then added coiffures as the spirit moved them. This freedom to mix types is an important aspect of coroplastic creativity. 224 Aspects of Ancient Greece, pp. 252-253, no. 123. 225 E. R. Williams 1978, p. 397, no. 63, pl. 101. 226 Higgins 1967, p. 104, pl. 47:c; the 3rd-century B.C. date suggested there seems too late. 227 KT-10-8, Corinth XV, ii, p. 133, no. 42, pl. 28.</page><page sequence="81">DISCUSSION 57 The coiffures sometimes have an element of fantasy, perhaps because, after so much repetition, the original designs had lost meaning. The towering projections of C126 and C133 are clearly part of the hair; the tooled strokes of better, less exaggerated examples, such as C139 and C157, detail the locks more clearly. But when the strokes become summary and the shape merges with the head into a cone, as in C159, the projection begins to resemble a hat. The schematic pattern of horizontal waves across the front of the hair is clearer in its possible mold relative C158, which is an unusually crisp mold impression. This head type was used for the peplos-figurine C33 and is known in a Corinthian seated type as well.228 C159 has globular blisters around the forehead, which means that it was formed in a plaster mold (see pp. 16-17) and therefore should not be dated before the later 3rd century B.C. It must be one of the latest of its type.229 A head in a conical cap of Scythian type with lappets and a disc finial (C160) also would seem to be a fantasy, except that the parallel, horizontal ridges on the cap suggest creases, as on a head in Paris that wears a horizontally creased, pointed headdress.230 C161 and C162 also wear peaked caps; the latter may have lappets and therefore may be a Scythian cap, leaving open the possibility that this figurine originally represented an Amazon. Some heads have a projecting topknot of hair over the center of the forehead, as in C127 and C 163; it is sometimes punched, presumably to suggest curls, as in C 134. It may have been an exaggerated form of the peak over the forehead into which the front hair was sometimes arranged, as in C138 and C155. Heads with both a high peak in front and a projection in back have a distinctive profile resembling a set of horns, as in C168; this coiffure is discussed further below (p. 171). C169, which also has a double-peaked coiffure, resembles a mold from the Potters' Quarter in facial type and scale (see catalogue). In other heads, the hair was braided back from the center of the forehead, as in C164 and C165, or the head might be circled by a plait, as in C 128. The braid pulled back from the center of the forehead is often seen on heads of children231 as well as young women. The braid sometimes is barely recognizable, as in C167; in these cases, one must assume that the coroplast no longer quite understood the arrangement of the coiffure or its original significance. The smiling, full-jawed face of C167 appears to be a later generation of C166, which wears a simpler coiffure, waving away at either side from a central part. Faint waves of this kind can still be seen around the forehead of C167, to which the braids in front and around the cranium apparently were added later. C170 and C171 are miniatures, corresponding in size with the small torso C113. Relatively little can be learned of the chronology of Corinthian "dolls" from the pottery contexts, as was true also of the peplos-figurines and seated female figurines. Only Pit A (lot 887) is really helpful, yielding the head type C125. The "doll" C124 combines a head closely similar in type and scale to C125 with a torso with projecting shoulders; through this association, it would appear that relatively small "dolls" with projecting shoulders already were being made by the last quarter of the 5th century B.C., the terminal date of Pit A. While the closing of the Potters' Quarter workshops dates the end of some figurine types, the output of articulated "dolls" seems to have continued, although it may have diminished considerably. Certainly the "dolls"' heads found in the Demeter sanctuary are much more varied in type than the heads and molds preserved in the Potters' Quarter, suggesting other sources. A few heads, such as C161 and C162, stand apart from the others strikingly in their type, workmanship, and relatively large 228 Winter, Typen I, p. 86, no. 7. 229 C159 is from lot 878, which is part of the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building. The architectural context of this lot is therefore early 3rd century B.C. (see lot list, p. 356), but the context does include a very small quantity of later, intrusive material (see p. 6); the use of a plaster mold suggests that this head is later as well. 23( Louvre III, p. 5, no.

In addition, the head made in a plaster mold (C159) could not have come from the Potters' Quarter, where there is no evidence for the use of such molds and which was inactive by the time plaster molds came into use. This head proves that the production of articulated dangling "dolls" continued in some measure well into the 3rd century B.C., even though seated "dolls" begin to appear in Corinth at that time (see p. 52). In the absence of a major producer of dangling "dolls," seated "dolls," introduced from Athens or Asia Minor, may have helped to fill the void. Seated "dolls" never became popular votives in the Demeter sanctuary, however, perhaps because they did not carry the same meaning as the customary dangling "doll." FIGURINES OF DANCERS RELATED TO ARTICULATED "DOLLS" (C172-C185) Torsos of nude "dolls" were used by coroplasts as the basis for a number of other types, not necessarily articulated, such as nude or semidraped Aphrodites (H266 and H268) and even a semidraped male torso (C199). The most common adaptation, however, was the bare-breasted dancer in a knee-length, belted skirt (C172-C179). The coroplasts simply added skirts by hand to the nude hips and thighs, and either hung articulated limbs, as in "dolls," or attached arms and lower legs in various poses, as in ordinary figurines. They might add skirt folds only beside the thighs, as in C174, or at the sides and front of the torso, as in C175 and C176, leaving the back nude, paper-doll fashion. When molds were taken from figurines thus transformed, the nude back molds continued to be used together with the draped fronts. The top of the skirt was either rolled over a narrow belt to hold it up, as in C172 and C179, or attached to a wide, close-fitting belt with borders at the top and bottom, as in C176 and C177. The skirt hem is usually in movement, either swaying slightly or fluttering more actively. One example has crossbands over the chest (C 178), a common article of clothing on many types of figures in active movement, worn to anchor the cloth. When worn over a nude chest, the bands were intended to help hold up the skirt or were merely decorative. In C113, a small, degenerate, completely nude "doll," the crossbands are obviously decorative. Complete figurines in museum collections point to the likelihood that at least some of the figurines in short skirts found in the Demeter sanctuary are of the type commonly called "kalathiskos dancers." C173 preserves enough of the arms to show that they were posed like those of fully preserved kalathiskos dancers.232 The head of C173, which is the only preserved head in the group, however, does not wear a kalathiskos but has the wavy hair and sphendone commonly found in articulated "dolls." Representations of such dancers, in different media, were widespread and have been the subject of extensive discussion.233 The point of interest for the present study is that the figurines probably represent professional dancers whose performances were connected with fertility cult and possibly with marriage.234 In renderings from various sites, these dancers wear a short chiton, a peplos of knee or hip length, or just a short belted skirt; sometimes there are crossbands over the bare chest. The dancers sometimes wear a kalathiskos or a flaring crown of leaves. They dance on tiptoe, perhaps leaping, with arms moving freely. It is easy to see how a workshop accustomed to making "dolls" would find the subject congenial. It is not known whether such dance performances actually took place at the Demeter sanctuary or whether images of these dancers, who were known to perform in the context of fertility cult, merely projected the idea of fertility to the votaries who purchased and dedicated the figurines. The sanctuary of the Classical period contained a small theatral area on the Upper Terrace, which apparently was intended for standing spectators watching activities 232 Cf.

Figurines of this type in Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, and New York236 are sometimes assigned to Athens, because the subject appears in Neo-Attic sculpture. As mentioned above, however, the use of this subject was widespread, and several factors suggest that most of the figurines representing these dancers were made in Corinth. The figurine in St. Petersburg is of Corinthian provenience; the clay of the example in Paris is said to be Corinthian; I was able to examine the figurine in New York, and the fabric and workmanship appear to be Corinthian. In addition, the torsos of the Berlin and St. Petersburg figurines look very much like C179, in that the method of constructing these figurines is typically Corinthian, using "dolls"' torsos and draping them with added folds; also Corinthian is the slightly awkward, improvised look of the result.237 In addition, the arm position of the dancers in Berlin is echoed in C173. Since the dancers were constructed on the torsos of "dolls," which were not meant to stand upright, and were represented in movement, a curious pillar-and-base arrangement supporting the figure from the back was added in some examples. In this way, the lightly jumping steps characteristic of these dancers could be suggested. The large, beautifully made, although fragmentary C172 shows that better Corinthian craftsmen were interested in the subject, but the humbler examples were probably made in the Potters' Quarter, in a workshop that also prepared articulated "dolls." How the subject came into use in the first place can only be a matter of speculation. In Corinth, the type seems to have been put together from local elements in a manner characteristic of local workshops. Perhaps a rendering in terracotta was simply the Corinthian response to a widespread religious custom, which was reflected in Athens in vase painting and sculpture, and elsewhere in various media. All these renderings are sometimes thought to derive from a lost sculpture of Kallimachos; if such a work did indeed exist, however, it need only have been inspired by the same source material. Hellenistic figurines of dancers wearing similar short skirts and wide belts, and with articulated limbs, have been found in South Italy.238 They are by this time rather degenerate in style but perhaps could have been derived from Corinthian prototypes. A short skirt with a wide belt is also characteristic of the costume of girl initiates who participated in the races at the Heraia in Argos, but in this case the chiton bares only one breast, and the representations (which are Archaic in date) clearly show a running pose.239 Although this group of figurines representing kalathiskos dancers appears to be of local origin, another type of dancer from the Demeter sanctuary (C180 and C181) has very clear Athenian stylistic connections. This type wears a short chiton or peplos that was part of the archetype and was not added to a nude torso, except in the most degenerate examples. The limbs of these dancers are always articulated; the thighs are usually socketed but are occasionally flanged. The drapery is modeled in a simplified form of the "quiet" style of Attic sculpture, which also is seen in the peplos-figurines (see pp. 33-34). The cloth is in movement, as if blown by the wind against the abdomen and around the thighs. The fine folds of C181 and its very short overfold, revealing the belt beneath, suggest that it is a close, perhaps mechanical copy of an Attic figurine type or was 235 Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 429. 236 Berlin: Winter, Typen II, p. 157, nos. 1, 2; Kodngliche Mu- seen, p. 13, pl.

An example from the Temple of Ares in the Athenian Agora shows a similar arrangement of folds between the thighs, as well as a very short overfold lifted by the breeze to reveal the belt.241 Although the earliest versions of this dancer type included the drapery, much poorer renderings were constructed by adding drapery to nude torsos, as in C182, using the technique already seen in the kalathiskos dancers. Probably the latest examples (C183 and C184) have thickened, flaring hems, which are pierced in a sort of compromise between the socketed and flanged forms of attachment. C 184 is the most degenerate; the margin of clay around the joint of the front and back molds was left untrimmed, and the head was merely glued to the scored surface of the shoulders. The sense of movement has been lost in these poor examples, apart from the clumsy, flaring hem, but all must have been intended to represent dancers. The parodying of nude "doll" types seen in C115 may be paralleled among the draped "dolls" by C185, a corpulent figure with a prominent abdomen, wearing a clinging chiton and crossband. Lacking the hem, one cannot be sure that the figure was portrayed in movement, but the type and costume are otherwise consistent with figurines of dancers. MALE FIGURINES: NUDE, SEMIDRAPED, AND DRAPED (C186-C202) The earliest male figurine in Classical style is the horse-rider C186. The figurine is a larger, moldmade version of the usually handmade riders, which date from the Archaic period to the 4th century B.c.242 In style, this rider retains an Archaic flavor in the horizontally ridged, wiglike hair, but the drapery, with its oval neckline and doughy zigzag folds, links it to the earliest standing peplos-figurines in Classical style (C1-C6) and suggests that it may have been made in the same workshop (Workshop D, p. 345). Like the peplos-figurines, the rider fuses Archaic and Early Classical stylistic features. C187 is another but smaller rider, to judge from the straddling pose; the figurine is handmade, but the anatomy of the nude torso and legs is clearly post-Archaic. Figurines representing horse-riders were frequently dedicated in Corinth in small hero shrines.243 The large number of such figurines dedicated at the Acrocorinth sanctuary, taken together with other types associated with heroes, such as banqueters, point to the worship of a hero there beside Demeter and Kore (see pp. 332-333). The possible reference of horse-rider figurines to the status and wealth associated in ancient Greece with owning horses244 would connect well with the worship of a hero. Such figurines might also be emblematic of horse races as part of hero worship.245 In Greek literature, the taming of horses is a metaphor for bringing girls into readiness for marriage.246 Most of the male figurines of the Classical period represent standing youths, usually nude or with a mantle draped down the back and covering only the arms, as in C190. They are solid and plaquelike, with flat or concave backs. Sometimes, illogically, the drapery forms a kind of backdrop, without any visible attachment to the figure, as in C188, C189, and C191. There are several possible explanations for this treatment. The most obvious is that the drapery on the arms may have been lost as the mold series progressed, but there may have been a specific 240 Cf. British Museum I, p. 192, no. 721, pl. 94. 241 Boulter 1953. 242 Corinth XV, ii, pp. 163-176, pl. 35-37.

An example of this class is MF-1 1884,247 in which a youth with drapery behind him stands on a plinth base like that of the better-preserved Classical youths (C188 and C190). The drapery background is seen also in Archaic terracotta sculpture. A late Archaic draped kouros from Syracuse, for which a Peloponnesian connection has been suggested, wears the mantle over one shoulder, from which it falls behind the back, hips, and thighs like a screen.248 Although all the standing youths of this group in Corinth were made during the Classical period, the Archaic reflections are clear not only in the drapery but also in the smile of C 188 and the strictly frontal stance of most members of the group. Only C189 shows a slight contrapposto; in the other figurines, one knee may bend slightly but without a corresponding movement in the hips. Since the figurines in this group are small (at the lower end of size range 2) and of rather indifferent quality, not much detail is preserved in the heads. The hair is always short, with a few broad waves above a low forehead, in the typical Early Classical style, as in C188-C190. One example shows a knot at the center of the forehead (C192), in a distinctive coiffure that is discussed below (pp. 62-63). A strip of clay was added to most of the heads to form a low, wide headdress, using a technique inherited from the Archaic period. It is not quite clear what kind of headdress was intended; the low form in the shape of a ring suggests a wreath, but in C190, in which the headdress is in the mold, the shape looks more like a polos. The youths, who probably are votaries, carry offerings appropriate to their age and sex: an aryballos (C188), a lyre249 (C190 and C193), and a rooster (C191).250 An oval object in the hand, as in C191, could be a vessel longer than an aryballos, such as an alabastron, a lekythos, or perhaps a purse for knucklebones, as seen more clearly in the semidraped youth C201. Similar youths with offerings were found at the Asklepieion, where they are thought to have had some connection with the earlier cult of Apollo.251 There they made up a much larger proportion of the total number of figurines than in the Acrocorinth sanctuary, where the count of standing youths reaches only ca. fifty-five. The nudity of most of the youths, except for a mantle covering the shoulders and arms or used as a backdrop, is worth noting, since the worshipers who approach deities on votive reliefs are usually well wrapped in mantles.252 The aryballos carried by C188 could suggest that this figurine represents an athlete; a painted and inscribed Corinthian kotyle offers evidence of a youths' footrace in honor of Persephone,253 and it may be significant that the one well-preserved figure in this painting is nude but for a mantle draped like a scarf over his shoulders and arms, similar to the garment of the figurines. Boeotian figurines of youths are similarly draped over the shoulders and arms, baring the front of the torso.254 In the context of coming-of-age rituals, nudity served the purpose not only of revealing sexual maturity but also of symbolically assisting the transformation from one stage of life to the next by removing the outmoded outward trappings.255 At the Acrocorinth sanctuary, handmade nude male figurines were already offered in the Archaic period (e.g., MF-10374256), perhaps pointing to a coming- of-age ritual beginning at that time. At sculptural scale, the terracotta figures of youths from the sanctuary are either wholly nude or semidraped.257 247 Publication forthcoming. 248 Holloway 1975, p. 32, figs. 182-184. A fragmentary late-5th- or 4th-century B.C. terracotta sculpture from the De- meter sanctuary (SF-69-8) shows the legs attached to a roughly modeled background (publication forthcoming by Nancy Bookidis). 249 The fragment V13 may be from a model lyre. 25) On the symbolism of the rooster, which had funerary associations as well as reference to the rising sun or life, see Goodenough 1958, VIII, pp. 59-70. 251 Corinth XIV, pp. 138-140, nos. 9-12, pl. 54. 252 E.g., a relief in Paris, Hamiaux 1992, p. 216, no. 224. 253 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 133-134, no. 292, pl. 32; Pemberton 1978, pp. 30-31,33. 254 See p. 292, note 42. 255 The issue of ritual nudity is summarized succinctly in Serwint 1993, pp. 420-421, with bibliography; see also Bon- fante 1989, pp. 545-546, note 16, and p. 551, note 45; Scanlon 1988; Lincoln 1991, pp. 103-104; Pinney 1993; Stewart 1997, pp. 27-34, with bibliography on pp. 239-241. 256 Publication forthcoming. 257 E.g., SF-65-14, Bookidis 1988, pl. 4 (semidraped).</page><page sequence="86">62 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS Insofar as the quality and condition of these figurines will allow comparisons, the slender proportions of C 188 fit in well with Late Archaic bronze statuettes of Peloponnesian provenience, such as the Herakles from Perachora,258 which is thought to be of Corinthian origin, and farther afield, bronzes from Olympia and Sparta.259 The latter have crowns of leaves or reeds, which could have inspired the added strip headdresses of the Corinthian figurines. An Early Classical rather than a Late Archaic archetype, however, seems more likely for the still slender but more muscular and developed torso of C189. Although the feet are not preserved, the stance has the subtle rhythm of the Oinomaos of the Olympia east pediment, one leg slightly forward, the opposite hip very slightly outthrust.260 The face of this figurine was poorly molded, but the hair and headdress are of the same type as C188. Several different archetypes seem to lurk behind this modest group of figurines, which are similar to one another in type, scale, and workmanship. It would appear that workshop materials of both Late Archaic and Early Classical stylistic date were available concurrently, allowing a version with an Archaic flavor, such as C188, to coexist with a more Early Classical rendering such as C189. Although only a few standing youths were found in the Potters' Quarter,261 those from the Demeter sanctuary and the Asklepieion appear to have been made there, perhaps all in the same workshop. Larger (up to size range 3) and better-made standing nude youths also were produced but have survived only in fragments. C194 and C195, the latter with the left arm swathed in drapery, are without contrapposto, but the anatomical modeling is subtle, showing the iliac crest and abdominal musculature as gentle bulges. The steep groin line and flat zigzag folds of C195 are still in the Archaic tradition. Both seem slender in proportions, even in their fragmentary state. There is as yet no evidence for continuous mold series from these youths to the smaller figurines. Although the youths, both large and small, recall in a general way the Boeotian figurines of youths from the Kabeirion at Thebes,262 and there is one possible Boeotian import of this type from the Demeter sanctuary (145), the archetypes must have been distinctly different in physical type from the stockier Boeotian youths. The influence of Boeotian figurines, however, may be responsible for the coiffure of C192 and the heads C203 and C204, in which long locks are drawn up to the center of the forehead and knotted. C204, together with heads from the Potters' Quarter and Asklepieion related to it and listed in the catalogue, also compare well with Boeotian figurines in facial type.263 On the other hand, the maker of C203 combined a Boeotian knotted coiffure with a more typically Peloponnesian narrow, large-featured face (on the facial type, see pp. 39-40).264 Knotted hair tends to appear in religious contexts, particularly in association with Demeter or related chthonic deities. The origin of the cult of the Kabeiroi at Thebes is connected in myth with Demeter.265 Representations of Eleusinian hearth initiates also sometimes show knotted hair,266 as does the youth, probably Ploutos, of the votive relief to the Eleusinian deities 258 Perachora I, pp. 140-142, pl. 45. 259 Mattusch 1988, pp. 62-63, figs. 4.13, 4.14, with bibli- ography.

On p. 106, note 47, uncertainty is expressed whether the coiffure had anything to do with religious custom. Evidence for ritual cutting of hair is strong, however. Perhaps the locks were tied off before cutting and dedicating them; on portrait B from Eleusis, pp. 104, 106, figs. 13, 14, a lock has been cut from the right temple; evidence for setting aside a lock of hair for dedication is recorded by Rouse 1902, p. 242 (his discussion of the dedication of hair at puberty on pp. 240-243).

Since the large-scale sculptured terracotta youths from the sanctuary, which are local creations, do not wear the knot, the latter is probably the case. Of the remaining fragments of larger nude male figurines, C196 seems Polykleitan in stance, as far as it is preserved. C 197 is much more three-dimensional than the others and is probably of 4th-century B.C. date; since this youth holds a patera, he may be a later version of a type found in the Asklepieion.269 The stance of C197 originally may have been similar to that of the smaller but more fully preserved C198. The partially draped C199 is notable technically because it was constructed from a nude female "doll's" torso, with the breasts smeared away and a mantle added around the hips and arms. Figurines of this type are not very common in Corinth, which may be why this example had to be put together in such a resourceful way. Male figurines draped in this manner are usually found in Asia Minor and Rhodes; generally these types are bearded and wear a polos, and they sometimes hold a patera in the right hand.270 Here they sometimes are identified as Dionysos or Zeus, by virtue of the polos. The examples from Lindos wear a full beard to the chest, of which there are no traces on C199. If it originally had a beard, it would have been shorter, as in the examples from Asia Minor. Similarly draped figurines of youths, which sometimes carry a piglet, are known from Magna Graecia.271 Perhaps the coroplast who made C199 had in mind a type known in Corinth through imported figurines, although the precise source is elusive. The mantle of C200 was included in the mold, not added to a nude torso, but the figurine may depend upon an earlier type, since the stacked folds down the shoulder and arm recall Archaic style. C201 is a semidraped counterpart of C188-C193, although it is of very different style. It is of comparably small scale, also carries offerings, in this case a ball and a knucklebone bag,272 and shares technical aspects, such as the inclusion of the base in the mold. The strong separation of the legs beneath the mantle suggests that the archetype of C201 was developed from a nude figure. The peculiarly top-heavy proportions, with oversized arms, are found also in Corinthian seated female figurines.273 The combination of piled-up hair in front and long locks of hair to the shoulders resembles the coiffure of the large-scale isolated male head C208. Like the foregoing figurines of youths, C201 probably represented a youth dedicating the toys of his childhood; this figurine is likely to have been made in the Potters' Quarter in the 4th century B.C. The last figurine in this group (C202) is of uncertain gender, since it is fragmentary, and the drapery is subject to different interpretations (see catalogue). If male, it would have been draped in a mantle similar to that of C199.

The latest pottery in the context of the semidraped C199 dates to the first quarter of the 4th century B.C., although the archaeological context is probably late 4th century. As in the case of the previously discussed figurine types, most of the unmixed pottery contexts associated with the standing male figurines range in date from the Archaic period or the 5th century B.C. to the late 4th or early 3rd century ISOLATED MALE HEADS (C203-C209) The isolated heads C203-C209 bear witness to larger male figurines of good quality, even approaching size range 4. Two of the heads (C203 and C204), already mentioned for their knotted coiffures, probably belonged to standing votaries. C205 and C206 are related in facial type to the Early Classical hydriaphoros group (see pp. 39-40), but their short, masculine coiffures distinguish them from the female heads. The hair of C205 is a schematic version of Archaic ringlets around the forehead; that of C206 is a cap of finger-waves close to the head. Although male and female head types overlap considerably, a distinction usually is made in the coiffures, allowing that some hair arrangements are common to both. In the present examples, the shortness of the hair in back, without any signs of a sphendone or sakkos to bind it, suggests that the heads originally belonged to male figurines, presumably standing votaries. C205 is unusually deep toward the back of the head and the neck, a peculiarity that is found from time to time among Corinthian heads and could be due to the adaptation of surviving molds or models once used for Archaic vessel protomes, the heads of which are sometimes similarly deep.274 Two other heads (C207 and C208), the latter of statuette scale and with remains of the red paint customarily used for male flesh, show the typical Early Classical facial type but in a 4th-century B.C. rendering. C207 retains the Early Classical double-scalloped wave at the center of the forehead, and C208 has large ears, recalling Archaic style, but the softer modeling of the features, the rounded browridge, and peaked front hair of C208, and the slashed tooling of the hair on both heads point to a later date of execution. A similar coiffure, in which a full, peaked mass of hair frames the forehead and long locks of hair spread over the shoulders, also known in female heads such as C64, is found in a smaller 4th-century B.C. figurine of a standing, semidraped youth carrying a ball and knucklebone bag (C201), discussed above. It is possible that the two heads originally belonged to a type similar to this one. The fleshiness of the nose and lips of C208 recalls some Tarentine faces.275 C209 is entirely different in facial type, being round in shape, with more delicate features, recalling the round faces of such "dolls" as C159. Were it not for a trace of red paint on the flesh, the head could have belonged to a female figurine. The coiffure is too schematic to confirm the gender of the figurine. Three fragments (V28-V30) are known to have belonged to male figurines by virtue of their red paint, which was usually employed for male flesh. They have been catalogued under Varia because they come from figurines of unknown type and uncertain date. Two large isolated feet (V29 and V30) and a hand (V28) are of statuette scale and are very well made. In fabric and workmanship they appear to belong to the 4th century B.C., although it is unclear whether they come from figurines of Classical or Early Hellenistic type. Since the fragments of the larger and better-made male figurines do not find parallels in the Potters' Quarter, and since there are no points of technique to connect them with these 274 Cf., e.g., Walenstein 1971, p. 130, no. V/A3, pl. 13:3. See also p. 119. 275 E.g., Herdejurgen 1971, p. 52, no. 37, pl. 9 (a female head dated to the end of the 5th century B.C.).</page><page sequence="89">DISCUSSION 65 workshops, one may assume that only the more consistent group of smaller figurines was made in the Potters' Quarter and that the larger figurines, especially the statuettes, were made elsewhere in Corinth. One further point to be mentioned is the surprising paucity of stylistic and iconographic connections between the male terracotta figurines and the terracotta sculpture from the sanctuary, considering that most of the sculptures also seem to have represented young male votaries. It is, of course, possible that the fragmentary state of the sculpture obscures similarities, but the heads and partial torsos that are preserved seem to belong to a different tradition.276 The circumstances of manufacture apparently discouraged cross-fertilization between the two crafts. It is very likely that the workshop facilities of coroplasts and sculptors in terracotta were separate. We know that terracotta sculpture was made in the Tile Works,277 but there is no evidence that figurines were made there. The few figurines dedicated in small shrines in the Tile Works278 were imported from the Potters' Quarter, where there is no evidence for the manufacture of terracotta sculpture. Hence, the coroplasts who made the figurines of standing youths may have been influenced more by workshop materials such as molds and archetypes available at hand than by direct observation of works outside the familiar technical sphere. Particularly in the conservative atmosphere of the Potters' Quarter, where these figurines were made, there seems to have been little inclination to seek out ideas beyond the traditional ones at hand. RECLINING MALE FIGURINES (BANQUETERS) AND RELATED HEADS (C210-C226) Figurines representing males reclining on dining couches are first known in Corinth in a few Late Archaic examples. One type is an unusual hand-modeled version, made in the Potters' Quarter in the late 6th century B.C.279 Also Late Archaic are a large, moldmade, plaquelike torso fragment (MF-13462280) and a curious moldmade banqueter, with a head like a satyr's, from the Potters' Quarter.281 The origin of terracotta banqueters in Archaic bronzes has been suggested;282 a very fine bronze banqueter in London has been attributed to Corinth,283 but the most common Corinthian terracotta type is not related to Archaic work in either material. As far as can be determined from the preserved figurines, the banqueter type was entirely redesigned in Corinth during the Early Classical period but without reference to any of the local predecessors. The new version is a semidraped youth holding a phiale (C210), a bowl (C216), a kantharos (C213, C214, C219), a lyre (C217), or an egg (C212), and the source is to be found in Early Classical Tarentine terracotta banqueters. The type is well represented in the Potters' Quarter, the Asklepieion, and the Corinth collection as a whole,284 but, like the standing youths, it does not seem to have been one of the more important votive types in the Demeter sanctuary. The Corinthian banqueters rarely have the elaborate headdresses of the Tarentine figurines.285 There are a few exceptions on figurines found elsewhere in Corinth,286 but presumably the headdresses had a cultic significance inapplicable in the Acrocorinth sanctuary. 276 Publication of the sculpture by Nancy Bookidis is forth- coming; some examples are illustrated in preliminary re- ports: Stroud 1965, p. 11, pl. 3:d; Stroud 1968, pp. 324- 326, pls. 95:c-e, 97:c, d; Bookidis and Fisher 1972, p. 317, pl. 63:a-d.

Tarentine influence is strongly discernible in C210, the Corinthian Classical banqueter that is earliest in style, in both pose and facial type;288 its face in particular retains a strong Archaic flavor. Although there are Tarentine banqueters earlier than C210 in style, there is no evidence that they were known in Corinth, and Corinthian coroplasts presumably first became aware of this source in the early 5th century B.C. or somewhat later. Both C210 and the more Classical C213 have the very full cheeks characteristic of some Tarentine banqueters, and C213 has the typical fleshy lips as well;289 the manner in which C213 holds the kantharos, with the thumb touching the handle, also is known in Tarentine work.290 A mold sibling ofC213 in the Circular South Shrine of the Potters' Quarter has been dated to the third quarter of the 5th century B.C.291 Another figurine with a Tarentine connection is the fragmentary C224; little is preserved of the figure, but it reclined on a high-legged couch of Tarentine type.292 No imported Tarentine banqueters have been recognized among the finds in Corinth, but either molds or figurines may have been brought into the Potters' Quarter workshops. A technical feature probably derived from Tarentum is backless construction, found in the banqueter C215 as well as in Corinthian standing peplos-figurines (see p. 26). There are two fragments (C211 and C212) of a banqueter type known in complete form in the Potters' Quarter.293 It is rather unlike the others in its awkward pose, long narrow face, coiffure with central knot over the forehead, and an egg in the hand. The type seems to be something of a pastiche put together from disparate parts. The head was attached to the torso at an awkward angle, and the right arm, also rather awkward, may have been reworked. The head type is known in Corinth among standing youths, including C192 from the Demeter sanctuary. The knot in the hair, probably originally borrowed from Boeotian figurines, is now scarcely discernible. The egg in the hand is paralleled in Tarentine reclining figurines.294 Two very similar banqueters from the Kabeirion are made of a fine, light-colored clay, which to Stillwell seemed Corinthian.295 Most of the Classical banqueters from the Demeter sanctuary have mold relationships with figurines from the Potters' Quarter, determining their origin without any doubt. The dates of the useful pottery contexts in the sanctuary, from the 6th to the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., are consistent with this conclusion. C215 and C216 have Potters' Quarter parallels from the Circular South Shrine (third quarter of the 5th century B.C. or later) and the Shrine of the Double 287 For the fillets on an early-4th-century B.C.

(ibid., p. 22). It is possible that this date is too early, although it is not contested in Corinth XV, iii, p. 186. The banqueter would fit more comfortably into the second half of the 5th century B.C., and there is an awkward chronological gap between Stele Shrine A and the Shrine of the Double Stele, which replaced it at the end of the 5th century. On the date of Stele Shrine A, see C. K. Williams 1981, p. 416, note 22; C. K.

The Corinthian origin is doubted by Nicholls 1958, p. 173, and by Schmaltz, Kabirenheiligtum V, p. 96, note 464, where a fine, light-colored fabric of Boeotian origin is mentioned. The finer Boeotian fabric, however, is confined to the Archaic period in Higgins 1986, pp. 65, 72, 98, and British Museum I, p. 203; it is not included in the discussion of clays in Kabirenheiligtum V, p. 4. Corinthian and Boeotian figurines of the Classical period are related only in small points, but certainly casual imports in both directions can be expected. The Potters' Quarter and Kabeirion figurines are probably not mold siblings, as Stillwell thought, but do seem to me to come from the same workshop. The clay of the examples in Corinth appears to be local.</page><page sequence="91">DISCUSSION 67 Stele (first half of the 4th century B.C.).296 C219 and C220, in which the mantle roll around the torso dips below the navel, stylistically should not be earlier than the 4th century B.C.; the pottery context of C219 terminates in the middle of that century. These two, together with C218, are relief plaques. This banqueter type was not found in the Potters' Quarter, but the prevalence there of relief plaques of other types, such as horsemen and sphinxes,297 is a technical link and suggests that the banqueter plaques were made there as well. There is no really clear evidence at the sanctuary for the large, usually bearded banqueters, some with seated women at their feet, known to have been made in Corinth in the Hellenistic period.298 The tiny seated females H377 and H378, which were perched at the ends of couches, may have belonged to parodies of banqueter types (see p. 198). The composition of two large (size ranges 3 and 4), fragmentary, semidraped male torsos (C221 and C222) would be suitable for reclining figurines; the latter is Early Hellenistic in style, but the anatomy and drapery style of C221 are appropriate to a Classical figurine. Another possible sign of the type is the poorly preserved C223, which is bearded but smaller and seems to be Classical in style. Two Classical bearded heads (C225 and C226) are of types suitable for banqueters and could have been inspired by Tarentine figurines.299 The elegant C226 is the later of the two in style; its wide face with a delicate jaw is not at all typical of Corinthian figurines, but its source is not readily apparent. It is difficult to know if there is any specific cultic conclusion to be drawn from the ages of the banqueters, as shown by the presence or absence of beards. Young banqueters unaccompanied by women certainly are more common at the Demeter sanctuary, but they are more numerous than bearded banqueters in Corinth as a whole. The iconographical significance of the reclining figure has been much discussed, but the subject is so complex that even the comprehensive study by Dentzer has not been able to narrow the interpretive possibilities.300 The very richness of content of these images and the possibility of different interpretations for different purposes must have been the reason for their popularity in so many places for such a long time. Most of the objects held by the youths, vessels of various kinds or a lyre, were normally associated with banquets, but the presence of a snake in one banqueter type (C219 and C220) must have chthonic significance.301 The egg carried by one type (C212) recalls 4th-century B.C. Boeotian protomes representing a young Dionysos holding an egg, sometimes together with a rooster, an attribute more commonly associated with Persephone.302 It is unlikely that the banqueter with the egg represents Dionysos, since he has a votary's knotted coiffure and does not wear the requisite wreath, but both images suggest a chthonic interpretation. The likeliest of the many interpretations, in the context of the Demeter sanctuary, seems to be that the reclining figurines represent a young banqueting hero, who either embodied the chthonic powers or could act as an intermediary for the worshiper. Youthful heroes do play a role in the worship of Demeter and Kore elsewhere, as in Boeotia, where the Kabeiroi may be associated with Demeter,303 or Eleusis, where Triptolemos is the actual bringer of agriculture to humans.304 It is probably significant that banqueter figurines have been found in hero shrines elsewhere in Corinth.305 The presence of dining rooms in the sanctuary should be mentioned here,306 but 296 KT-19-66, KT-19-83, KT-19-87, Corinth XV, ii, pp. 110- 111, nos. 26-28, pls. 21, 22; for the dates of these deposits, see ibid., p. 23 and Corinth XV, iii, pp. 202, 214.

While they may indeed have suggested banqueting to the purchaser, the dedication of similar figurines in other shrines and the presence ofchthonic attributes in some examples suggest that a symbolic reading probably should be preferred to a literal one, bringing the figurines into connection with the reclining heroes of Totenmahlreliefs.307 This interpretation is still more to be preferred because the actual banqueters occupying the dining rooms at the sanctuary were more likely to have been women than men.308 If numbers are a factor, one might conclude that the worship of a hero did not play a very important role in the cult of Demeter and Kore in Corinth, since, apart from the catalogued examples, only ca. thirty-six banqueters have been counted in the lots. It is possible, however, that the numerous handmade horse-riders (see p. 60) also refer to hero cult. If the Demeter of Acrocorinth is indeed the "Epoikidie" mentioned by Hesychios, as the major deity presiding over the home, the domestic cults of each family might have come under her protection. Williams' study of small Corinthian shrines has revealed a devotion to domestic deities and heroes so strong that their worship was pursued in shrines on the sites of destroyed houses.309 Hence hero worship in the Demeter sanctuary could have been simply a transference of the cult of each family's hero(es) to a more formal venue; it need not necessarily point to the worship by all the Corinthians of specific well-known figures, such as the Kabeiroi or Triptolemos. It may be significant that there was a Mycenaean house on the site before the establishment of the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore.310 SEATED CHILDREN AND RELATED HEADS (C227-C250) Children were a favored subject of coroplasts and sculptors in the Classical and Hellenistic periods, and as time went on, they were portrayed with increasing sympathy and naturalism. In this section, the earliest figurines of children preserved in the Acrocorinth sanctuary, the so-called temple boys or crouching children, are discussed. This group consists of small boys seated on the ground in various poses, often with one knee raised. In addition to the catalogued examples and their mold relatives, ca. twenty-four seated boys were counted in the lots. Most of the seated boys lean on the left hand. The left leg rests flat on the base in a folded position, and the right hand rests on the right knee, which usually is raised. Variations occur in the pose of the head, the alignment of the torso, and the angle at which the right leg is bent. C227-C230 and C241 take the standard pose; in C231, C232, and C242, the right hand still rests on the knee, but the leg is relaxed on the base; C233 is similar, but the right lower leg is turned inward; in C236, C237, C239, and C240, one or both arms reach up; the head is sometimes thrown back, as in C236, C237, C245, and C246. There is only one example from the Demeter sanctuary of a less common type in which both arms are forward, the hands resting on the front of the base (C234). Two boys (C236 and C237) wear strings of amulets; since only the cords are rendered, the amulets probably were added in paint.311 The bases of the seated boys vary from rectangular shapes with vertical sides to low, irregular shapes with rounded edges. The quality of workmanship ranges from excellent (C241) to poor (C235, C239, and C240). The type, which is widely known, is of eastern Mediterranean, probably Cypriote origin, although based on Egyptian prototypes, and may have been introduced to mainland Greece through Rhodes.312 Because of the solemn, somewhat hieratic appearance of the earliest examples 307 Thonges-Stringaris 1965, pp. 48-54. 308 Bookidis 1993, pp. 50-51. 309 C. K. Williams 1981, p. 418. 310 Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 13-15. 311 For detailed amulet cords on seated boys, see, e.g., stone statuettes from Kourion (di Cesnola 1885, pl. CXXXI). 312 Hadzisteliou-Price 1969, p. 96. More recently on the type, Beer 1987.</page><page sequence="93">DISCUSSION 69 and their widespread discovery in sanctuaries, the figurines once were thought to represent divine children or cult attendants. Hadzisteliou-Price, however, has stressed that these figurines are portrayals of real children, either placed in the graves of children or dedicated to patron deities of health, fertility, childbearing, or nurturing, to ensure the growth of families.313 In Corinth, terracotta figures of seated boys are known in a cultic context not only in the Demeter sanctuary but also in the Asklepieion, where they were dedicated in both small and large scale;314 they also are known in a funerary context in the North Cemetery.315 There is no clear evidence as yet that seated boy figurines were made in Corinth in the Archaic period. The earliest examples from the Demeter sanctuary should date to the 5th century. Stillwell thought that one mold of this type from the Potters' Quarter was late Archaic in style,316 and it does seem to be the oldest of the preserved molds of seated boys. Since the earliest preserved figurines of this type in Corinth seem to be Classical, however, it is probably best not to isolate this mold from the other molds and the figurines but to regard it as one of the first of its type to appear in the Early Classical period and as somewhat conservative in style. The earliest seated boys (e.g., C227) are not very childlike in appearance or movement, probably because of a tendency in the art of the period, for example, in grave reliefs, to depict children as small adults or with idealized features. Even in well-made figurines in fine fabric, such as C245, an adult quality in the face may contrast strangely with the childish torso. In this case, the workshop may have adapted for the child a face mold originally intended for figurines of youths. The result combines a beautifully prepared fabric with a misconceived, rather crudely retouched portrayal of a child, as if the artisan was not equally skilled in all aspects of the craft. Alternatively, more than one artisan, with varying levels of skill, may have contributed to the manufacture of this figurine. The head C247 is bald, as if to portray an almost hairless infant, and an attempt has been made to show a baby's pursed mouth, but the overall effect is not convincingly babyish. More successful baby's heads can be seen in C237 and C238. Consequently, the ages of the boys represented are somewhat uncertain. The later and more realistic examples are the most informative in this respect. C236 and C237, with pudgy cheeks, wearing amulets and the pilos pulled down over the ears, and reaching up to be carried, are clearly babies who cannot yet walk. The best made of all the seated boys (C241) has a similarly babyish anatomy and also wears a baby's pilos, but he seems a little older because of his more mature, subdued pose and more idealized face. As far as one can tell, most of the other figurines in this group also represent baby boys, not beyond the age of toddlers. An exception is the slender C242, who is much more grown-up, with a defined waist, long hair, and a mantle over the shoulder; he is probably approaching puberty. This type may be a later survival, created under the influence of Early Hellenistic figurines of older boys who are, however, represented in poses more suited to their age (see pp. 187-191). The head of C242 is missing, but it could have been similar to the head of C243, which has similarly long hair and seems to be about the same age. One of the baby boys (C230), however, also has long hair. Children of the intermediate ages between babyhood and puberty cannot be identified among the seated figurines of Classical type but can be found among the Early Hellenistic standing types, such as H319. It is uncertain whether some change occurred in cult practice to account for the enlarged repertoire of types or whether we are dealing with a purely artistic phenomenon, the general expansion of Hellenistic subjects to embrace many more aspects of daily life. The question of possible change in the place of children in sanctuary ritual is discussed below (p. 188). 313 Hadzisteliou-Price 1969, pp. 107-110. 314 Corinth XIV, pp. 140-141, nos. 25, 26, pl. 54 (figurines, V 134 and M.F. 9155); p. 140, no. 24, pl. 55, a statuette (V 111), which is thought to be a naturalistic representation of a sick child: Beer 1987, p. 24. 315 T-2262, T-2260, Corinth XIII, p. 282, nos. 453-4, 453-5, pl. 74. 316 KH-60, Corinth XV, i, pp. 105-106, no. 61, pl. 40.</page><page sequence="94">70 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS The Classical figurines of children represent boys, with the exception of one girl (C248), presumably because of a preference for male offspring.317 In a custom recorded by Pollux (Onomastikon 3.40) and recently recognized in Attic vase painting, a male child with both parents living (7atq &amp;icpiGLtXoq) participated in marriage rituals by sleeping with the bride; the child appears to have been regarded as a kind of magical force to ensure successful childbirth, particularly the bearing of male offspring.318 Whether or not this custom was followed at Corinth, figurines of baby boys, if dedicated at the time of marriage, could have carried a similar meaning. The terracotta model likna filled with cakes offered at the Demeter sanctuary319 recall another ritual task of the alqS &amp; 6i(plOaXc)q, who carried an actual cake-filled liknon at the wedding; these cakes are thought to have been symbolic of eagerly awaited children,320 the parallel perhaps being drawn between the rising and baking of loaves in the oven and the growth of the child in the womb. As patronesses of agricultural fertility, Demeter and Kore also were invoked to assure human increase; both goddesses sometimes were associated with childbirth,321 although the evidence suggests a greater emphasis on the nurturing of children. The association of the Queen of the Underworld with motherhood is somewhat problematic,322 but the pinakes from Lokroi have been interpreted convincingly to show Persephone as a kourotrophic deity at that sanctuary.323 Certainly the rearing of children was an important area of patronage for Demeter. The quintessential mother in myth, she bore the epithet "kourotrophos" in Athens and plays the role of nurse in the well-known Homeric hymn dedicated to her.324 Closer to Corinth, Pausanias (2.5.8) records the story ofPlemnaios of Sikyon, whose children all died at birth until Demeter took pity on him, and in disguise she nursed his son Orthopolis safely through childhood. In addition, the Orphic Hymns, which are understood to be a Roman Imperial compendium of earlier epithets and cult formulas,325 emphasize the role of Demeter as a protectress of children more insistently than any other goddess, using for her the descriptive terms "kourotrophos," "paidophile," and "polytekne" (Orphei Hymni 40, lines 2, 13, 16). Certainly the epithet "Epoikidie," if understood correctly for the Demeter of Acrocorinth, would encompass child rearing within the concerns of the household. The images of baby boys found in the Demeter sanctuary, then, would express a wish not only for the birth of children but also for their successful nurturing. At least five terracotta heads and a number of limbs of small children of sculptural scale found in the Demeter sanctuary326 fall into the same class of votives.327 In connection with this aspect of Demeter's cult, it may be worth mentioning that although a few kourotrophos figurines have been found in Corinth as a whole, a standard type never was created, as was the case in other centers, especially in Italy and Sicily.328 The only kourotrophoi from a known cultic context in Corinth are two Archaic examples from the Demeter sanctuary, 317 On the evidence for such a preference, see Kauffmann- Samaras 1988, pp. 293-297. Westholm (1955, p. 77) suggests that these figurines were prayers or thank offerings for a male child; some of the Cypriote figures stress the male sex of the child, who lifts his garment as if to reveal it. It has also been suggested that such figurines were offered in Cyprus on the occasion of circumcision: Beer 1987, p. 23. 318 Kauffmann-Samaras 1988, pp. 290-292; Reilly 1989, pp. 426-427. 319 Brumfield 1997. 320 Redfield 1982, p. 193. 321 Farnell, Cults III, p. 81. 322 On this subject, see Zuntz 1971, pp. 80-81. 323 Sourvinou-Inwood 1978, p. 117. 324 On epigraphic evidence for the epithet, see Farnell, Cults III, pp. 81, 333, note 109; as nurse of Demophon, Homeric Hymn to Demeter, lines 219-264; also as nurse of Tro- phonios, Pausanias 9.39.5. See also Hadzisteliou-Price 1978, pp. 190-191; Clinton 1992, pp. 31-34. Vorster (1983, pp. 76- 78) however, denies Demeter any function as kourotrophos, seeing in her the goddess of the Mysteries without interest in the affairs of everyday life. On the connection of Demeter with Asklepios, see Benedum 1986. 325 Guthrie (1966, pp. 256-261) discusses evidence connect- ing the hymns with the precinct of Demeter in Pergamon. For a different view, see West 1983, pp. 28-29, with bibliography. 326 Publication forthcoming by Nancy Bookidis. 327 A simple modern ritual known in Italy may be a survival of ancient belief in Demeter's protection of children's health. The ritual, described in Turci 1983, pp. 53-56, includes the preparation of bread dough, lumps of which are formed into cakes and applied to the body of a sick child. 328 E.g., Bonfante 1984; for kourotrophoi among the fig- urines from the Thesmophorion at Bitalemi, see Kron 1992, pp. 628-629.</page><page sequence="95">DISCUSSION 71 MF-13558 and MF-71-54,329 one of which is an import.330 Two kourotrophic Hellenistic actor types (H363 and H364) might be added. Also lacking are figurines of swaddled infants and uterus models, which demonstrate a concern for pregnancy, childbirth, and infant care, as, for example, at Paestum.331 Unless a large cache with new and different types awaits discovery, Corinthian votives relating to children usually took the form of figurines of children alone, without the nurse or mother, or perhaps of perishable offerings of clothing, sandals, or textiles, which are attested elsewhere.332 Further evidence pointing to Demeter as kourotrophos in Corinthian cult may be Corinthian vase paintings in which dancing women appear together with a kourotrophos and a spinner. The cult represented has been assigned by scholars to various deities, including Demeter and Kore.333 The presence of Aphrodite in the sanctuary, which could have been connected with the erotic aspects of marriage, might have been linked with children as well, since she was worshiped as a nurturer of children in Cyprus, her original home, where fine stone statuettes of seated boys, very similar in type to the figurines, were dedicated to her.334 There is another possible interpretation of figurines of children, particularly when dedicated in a sanctuary of chthonic deities. That is, the figurines could represent children who have died and are being consigned, by way of the images portraying them, to the care of the Queen of the Under- world. Certainly among the most poignant images of ancient art is that of a little boy on an Attic white-ground lekythos in New York, entering the Underworld with his pull-toy.335 Perhaps the fig- urines from the sanctuary are to be understood, at least in part, in the same artistic context. When found in graves, similar figurines have been thought to represent the dead child.336 Certainly the seated boys are represented at the most vulnerable age for children in ancient Greece.337 Several different interpretations of figurines of children have been suggested here, without preferring one above the others. We cannot know, of course, precisely what events or thoughts precipitated the offering of figurines, and it is conceivable that a given figurine type was dedicated in the sanctuary for more than one purpose, depending upon the needs and circumstances of each votary. 329 Publication forthcoming. 330 Others: MF-1587, MF-3457, Corinth XII, p. 34, nos. 140, 141, pl. 10; p. 55, no. 387, pl. 35; a mold from the Tile Works, MF-8634, which is probably based on a Tarentine prototype (publication forthcoming); a Corinthian figurine in Paris, Louvre III, p. 54, no.

Discussions of the "Frauenfest" thus far have not taken into account the material from the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore; it may be worth noting that the cultic elements represented in the vase paintings, including a con- nection with Dionysos, would fit the cult of Demeter and Kore as reflected in the figurines (see also pp. 336-337). 334 Hadzisteliou-Price 1969, p. 106; Beer 1987, p. 22, both with bibliography. 335 Children in Greek funerary art are discussed in Ruhfel 1984, pp. 75-184, with bibliography; the lekythos is illustrated on p. 116, fig. 47:a. 336 Hadzisteliou-Price 1969, pp. 109-110. Or perhaps fig- urines of children were offered at the sanctuary in the hope that living children would be spared. An interesting group of mod- ern folktales tells of the granting of a child to a childless couple by a "Lady from the Sea" (perhaps a survival of Aphrodite?), after the eating of a fruit or some other food. Later, when the child reaches maturity, the goddess claims him for herself; see Dawkins 1953, pp. 28-29. Such stories may be metaphors for the untimely death of children. 337 On childhood mortality, see Sallares 1991, pp. 117-118, and tables on p. 110 and in note 87 on pp. 435-436, with bibliography.</page><page sequence="96">72 CLASSICAL FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS Good parallels for the Demeter sanctuary boys among the figurines and molds from the Potters' Quarter are enumerated in the catalogue, and it is clear that some of the figurines of this type were made there. With so little anatomical detail in the figurines, however, their mechanical relationships are very difficult, if not impossible, to determine accurately. At least six different molds would have been needed to produce the extant figurines, but it is uncertain whether any of the molds found in the Potters' Quarter were involved. As far as can be determined, the Classical figurines of children from the Demeter sanctuary range in date from the third quarter of the 5th century B.C. to at least the third quarter of the 4th. One boy with both arms forward to rest his hands on the front of the base (C234) is likely to be of 5th-century B.C. date; there is a small bronze from Delphi in this pose, with a face of Classical style,338 and figurines from Sicily and Rhodes in this pose have been dated to the 5th century B.C. (see catalogue). The pottery contexts of the children usually have the same long chronological range as the contexts of the other types from the sanctuary that were made in the Potters' Quarter, that is, the 6th to the early 3rd century B.C. Therefore, one must depend for dates upon the figurines themselves and more closely datable parallels from the Potters' Quarter. C227, which seems earliest in style, has a close parallel from the Circular South Shrine, the contents of which are dated to the third quarter of the 5th century B.C. or later.339 C230, which looks much later, has parallels in molds from deposit 3 of the Terracotta Factory, which has been dated to the third quarter of the 4th century B.C.,340 and in a grave in the North Cemetery of the same date.341 The boy reaching up with one or both arms (C236 and C237) is not paralleled in the Potters' Quarter, and the type is so much more naturalistic in concept that it seems a completely separate one, probably developed elsewhere in Corinth in the 4th century B.C. An example of this type was found in a child's grave in the North Cemetery, dated to the third quarter of the 4th century B.C.342 It is known also in bronze.343 The tiny (size range 1), very summary, untrimmed C239 and C240 seem to be a degenerate version of this type, although without demonstrable mechanical continuity. Nor can the more sophisticated and well-made C241, probably of 4th-century B.C. date, be connected with the Potters' Quarter. This figurine is particularly interesting, since the flat, overlapping pleats of the cloth on which he sits, as well as the flattened omega fold on the base, recall the fold pattern of the much earlier seated boy from the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.344 Although the face of C241 is somewhat idealized and not as puffy or babyish as the faces of C237 and C238, the pilos is pulled down low over the forehead, with no signs of hair, as in babies' heads. If C242 was influenced by Early Hellenistic representations of children, as suggested above (p. 69), it is likely to date to the later 4th or early 3rd century B.C., in spite of the almost Archaic appearance of the stacked, curved mantle folds over the arm. There is only one very small (size range 1) seated girl (C248). Her miniature size, uniplanar composition, and fine detail suggest that the mold may have been taken from metal relief. The closest parallels are larger figurines from Ruvo, which are thought to have been made from an imported Attic mold.345 It is interesting that the very finely modeled folds of the Ruvo figurines also point to a metallic source. A little boy playing with a Maltese dog (C249) has been treated with a preservative, but the original fabric, visible on the underside, seems local.

In two examples (C233 and C241), the upturned rim is stippled, probably indicating that the cap is made of sheepskin, worn fleece inside. Caps of this type were standard headgear worn by both youths and men,349 but they also are seen in representations of swaddled infants and were used as protective coverings for childrens' heads.350 Two children (C236 and C237) wear amulet cords diagonally across the chest. A few sit on cloths draped partly over one leg or arm (C241, C242, C244). One type of boy in a pilos also is wrapped in a mantle (C250), a widespread 5th-century B.C. type well represented in the Kabeirion at Thebes; these squatting figures are sometimes thought to represent Hermes but more probably are shepherd boys.351 Most of the known examples are not from datable contexts, but a similar piece from the Athenian Kerameikos comes from a context dated ca. 420 B.C.352 The rather degenerate Corinthian example must be later; while there is no reason for seeing in it a particularly Corinthian type, not enough detail is visible to point to the exact source. The pottery context of C250 dates from the 6th to the mid-4th century B.C. PROTOMES, THYMIATERIA, AND MASKS (C251-C273) The terms "protome," "bust," and "mask" all are used in the literature, sometimes with conflicting definitions, to refer to representations of a head and upper torso. In this discussion, "protome" is used for a head with the neck and all or part of the shoulders, backless but with sides to help it stand upright. "Bust" is used for representations in the round; the busts of this period appear to be thymiateria (C261 and C262). "Mask" is applied here to backless heads, usually somewhat flattened, that terminate at the chin or beard. Viewed from the perspective of West Greek sites, where they are found in great profusion, protomes seem not to have been particularly important at Corinth. Perhaps the whole story is not yet known, for although only one reasonably well preserved large protome has been found in Corinth,353 fragments of others have appeared from time to time in the excavations; imported protomes from the Demeter sanctuary are discussed below (p. 293). The most typical Corinthian protomes known up to now are much smaller and were pierced for suspension. They consist of 5th-century B.C. spoon-based protomes of lingering Archaic style (see p. 23, note 1), a backless Late Archaic type (MF-13661),354 and the Classical types C251-C257, which also are backless. There appears to have been a break in the tradition between the Late Archaic and Classical backless protomes, marked by the development of a new archetype. The Archaic type wears a fillet and veil, while the Classical examples wear the polos; the coiffure remains 346 For a selection of typical compositions, see Winter, Ty- pen II, pp. 275-282; the subject is discussed by Klein 1932, pp. 10-13. 347 Krystalli-Votsi 1976a, p. 65, pl. 58:8; the tomb is not dated. 348 On the Maltese dog (the melitaios) as a pet, and the question of its interpretation, see Ruhfel 1984, pp. 166-168, with bibliography; R.

From their scanty remains, the Archaic protomes seem closer than the Classical to the East Greek tradition. Both the spoon and the backless types were made in the Potters' Quarter, and a mold closely related to C251 was found there.355 This mold shows a female protome in polos and veil; the left hand touches the edge of the veil (as in C256), and the right hand seems to display the breast (as in C257). These gestures are clearer in examples from Rhodes and Boeotia, in which the veil is actually grasped, as if to lift it (in a gesture of anakalypteria or, conversely, to cover the face in modesty), and the other hand clearly surrounds the breast in a displaying gesture or holds a fruit.356 In other protomes, both hands display the breasts,357 in a gesture that suggests fertility and is of Near Eastern origin.358 The type is sometimes interpreted as Persephone as a bride, wearing the marriage veil.359 This identification also could be valid for the Corinthian protomes, although the suggestion of fertility is appropriate to Demeter or Aphrodite as well. Perhaps the dedicants in this sanctuary offered votives that contained the idea of the bride and fertility rather than a reference to a specific deity. Although the typical Corinthian Early Classical protome type is preserved in the Demeter sanctuary in only a few fragmentary examples (C251-C257), the facial type is reasonably clear in C251. In its full-cheeked, oval outline, prominent eyes, and pronounced arch of the brows springing from a flattened nose bridge, this facial type is distinctly different in structure from the long, narrow faces that are so characteristic of Corinthian figurines (see pp. 39-40). C251 shares stylistic features with the large Corinthian protome mentioned above (see p. 73, note 353); although much of the upper part of the large protome is missing, similarities are evident in the outline of the jaw and the shape of the features. The small protomes are not entirely consistent among themselves but vary with respect to the mechanism for suspension. In C251, the hole for suspension was cut into the hair just above the forehead. In C252-C255, the hole was cut vertically into the top of the polos; C252 and C253 also show a freer rendering of the hair and facial features, suggesting that they were made in a different workshop or at least that the archetypes were made by a different artisan. C254 is similar to C251 in its clearly marked browridge over prominent eyes, but the facial shape is more typical of Early Classical figurines in its narrowness; the polos is low and wide, and the hair frames the forehead in two undetailed masses divided by a central part. A fragmentary example of this type was found at the Potters' Quarter (see catalogue). C255 appears to be a smaller, degenerate version of this protome type. In addition to the typical local protomes, at least one type (C259) is so similar to Rhodian and Boeotian protomes, and so dull an impression, that it may have been copied mechanically from an import.360 Two imported protome fragments (155 and 156) are in fact from heads usually associated with the relevant torso type. The number of imported protomes (152-156) is relatively large, when compared with the number of local examples. This is a curious phenomenon, in light of the generally abundant production of figurines in Corinth. Perhaps foreign residents, if they participated in the local cults, were the main dedicators of protomes, following a custom more familiar to them than to local residents. Two fragments (C258 and C260) are from types otherwise unknown in Corinth and without clear parallels elsewhere. Perhaps future excavation in Corinth will clarify the matter and bring out more types in regular local production. 355 KH-26, Corinth XV, i, pp. 97-98, no. 28, pl. 32. 356 Cf.

The break at the top of C261 probably is from a floral finial, but while most of the other known examples include the shoulders, C261 ends at the collarbones. Another thymiaterion has been found in Corinth, but it includes the shoulders and wears a chiton and veil.362 Closer in type to C261 is a shoulderless bust of reported Eleusinian provenience, which also has a break at the top, presumably from a missing finial.363 It rests on a spool base, which may have been true of C261 as well. Similar thymiateria found in the Heraion at Foce del Sele are thought to represent Hera,364 while others, in which Eros appears, must represent Aphrodite.365 The image probably suggested fertility, in this case supported by the flower, and would have been an appropriate gift for a number of goddesses, including Demeter and Kore. Since the floral cups are missing, we cannot know for certain whether incense actually was burned in them. The facial type of C261 and C262, oval in shape, with a short nose and narrow, full-lipped mouth, seems more Hellenistic than Classical. C262, however, is from a context with pottery dating from the 5th century B.C. to the first half of the 4th. The pottery context of C261 terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The very fine fabric of both thymiateria is known in figurines made in the middle to third quarter of the 4th century B.C. (see p. 136). Apparently at that time one of the better Corinthian workshops adapted the South Italian floral thymiaterion type to local taste, although the production probably was not very large. The face fragment C263 is of similar scale and is also thin-walled, although of poorer fabric. Its style is Middle rather than Early Hellenistic, resembling the later-3rd-century B.C. heads of "priestesses" (e.g., H401); if this head indeed belonged to a thymiaterion, it is evidence that such votives continued to be offered at Corinth well into the 3rd century B.C. The large, hollow head C264 could originally have belonged to a bust or perhaps a thymiate- on. The pose of the head is rigidly frontal, the face is rather flat, and the base of the columnar neck could be spreading into a bust. Since the top of the head is missing, it is impossible to know whether it terminated in a finial like that of C261. In any case, the facial type of C264, with its large, downturned eyes, arched nose, and small chin, is paralleled in such Corinthian heads as that of the Early Hellenistic mantled figurine H102. If the idea of making busts with large, hollow, fully three-dimensional heads was borrowed from Italy, it has here been thoroughly adapted to the local taste. The following protomes are more difficult to discuss because of their fragmentary condition. C265 is framed by a veil, behind which is an arched flange pierced for suspension. The veil stands away from the head as if windblown, as in the large Corinthian protome mentioned above (see p. 73, note 353), which also has preserved part of the veil. Another fragment from the Demeter sanctuary (MF-13942 [see catalogue under C265]), preserves a small part of the flange and veil of a protome of larger scale but probably of similar type. The fragmentary C266 also could belong to this group. In the cave at Pitsa was found a protome that may be Corinthian and perhaps is related to this group; it has cup-shaped, realistically detailed flowers (probably 361 See material collected in Stoop 1960, pp. 3-23; later bibliography in LIMC IV, 1988, p. 668, d, s.v.

A female protome wearing a similar headdress was found among the dedications at the Artemis Altar in Olympia,368 but thin, stippled wreaths of this kind also appear on Boeotian protomes representing Dionysos.369 Certainly representing Dionysos are five masks, generally similar to one another in type but unrelated mechanically or in style (C268-C272). The presence of such masks should not be surprising, since the name of Dionysos was inscribed on a terracotta plaque found in the sanctuary,370 and Demeter and Dionysos were invoked together as the great benefactors of mankind in providing grain and wine (Euripides, Bacchae, lines 274-286). Terracotta masks of Dionysos were a specialty of Boeotian workshops,371 and the impetus to make them could have come to Corinth from that source. C272 is so similar to one type of Boeotian mask372 and is such a dull impression that it could have been mechanically copied from an imported piece. Probably the same can be said of C271. Both masks probably were made in the Potters' Quarter (see catalogue). As in some female protomes, C271 has suspension holes driven vertically into the top of the polos. The remaining Corinthian examples are different in style and detail from Boeotian masks, and presumably the local artisans here followed other sources or their own inclinations. C268 is a well-formed head from a good mold, but it was splashed with paint, without an underlying slip, in the comic manner usually reserved for handmade grotesques (as in the Archaic MF-1 1864).373 C268 probably was made in the 5th century B.C. in the Potters' Quarter, where this technique is known.374 C269 is the most detailed and carefully made of the small masks. Its rather startled expression and parted lips recall a Dionysos protome from the Kabeirion at Thebes, thought to be an Attic import derived from a metallic source.375 The manner of dressing the hair, with wavy locks at the forehead, and a wreath and a polos or stephane behind, is known in 4th-century B.C.

Harrison (1996, p. 206) points out that the pose of Demeter and Dionysos on the Parthenon frieze, facing with overlapping legs, is like the pose employed in Egyptian art "to depict the intercourse of the Pharaoh's mother with a god from whom the king takes his divinity." If the resem- blance is not fortuitous, Dionysos would have been understood as Demeter's consort, that is, her partner in the maintenance of fertility; cf. Pindar's reference to Dionysos sitting beside Deme- ter (Isthmian Odes 7.3-5).

Two masks from the Demeter sanctuary (C270 and C273) resemble superficially a fine, large, bearded mask from the Asklepieion.378 Although its workmanship is different from that of the Asklepieion mask, C270 could have been derived from a mask of this type. C273, the finest mask from the Demeter sanctuary, is a little smaller than the Asklepieion mask and different in the style of the face and the retouching technique. It is distinctive in facial type and in the presence of small, curving horns above the forehead. The general type, bearded and wearing a wreath of overlapping leaves, suggests Dionysos, particularly in his chthonic aspect,379 but the goatlike horns are somewhat puzzling. A Corinthian pyxis in Reading shows a beardless figure with goatlike horns springing from the top of his hair; he is identified as Dionysos.380 The god is seated on a pile of grain and holds a winnowing fan and fork; a pig and a basket of fruit are beside him. The agricultural theme would appear to link Dionysos (if the identification is correct) with Demeter and could refer to the cult of the Acrocorinth sanctuary. More often, however, representations of a horned Dionysos are understood to show him in the aspect of Dionysos Tauros, and the horns are the thick, incurving ones of a bull.381 Goat's horns are more appropriate to Pan. Representations of Pan vary considerably in the manner in which his animal nature is shown; the narrow, closely set eyes and rather cruel mouth of the mask do resemble some representations of Pan in a modified way, and the apparently deliberate misshaping of the ears may have been intended to make them look more animal-like.382 Perhaps the mask was intended to suggest aspects of both deities, whose spheres to a certain degree overlap;383 the horns may have suggested to the worshiper a particular aspect of Dionysos, his connection with goats, which signify procreation.384 The sexual symbolism of horns is discussed below (p. 171). If this interpretation is correct, a goat-horned Dionysos mask would be an especially apt image for the Demeter sanctuary, suggesting not only the chthonic and vegetative aspects of Dionysos but also his connection with human increase. In this connection, it is perhaps of interest that in the Orphic Hymns not only Dionysos and Pan are described as horned but also Persephone, in the context of giving fruit (Orphei Hymni 29, line 11), and Adonis, invoked as the spirit of growth (Orphei Hymni 56, line 6). Perhaps in this case horns are better understood as a symbol of growth and fertility than as an attribute of a particular deity. The mask has a flange in back for suspension, as do many protomes and masks. It probably was made to hang on a wall. It is conceivable that it was hung on a pillar image of the kind frequently represented in vase painting,385 although Athenian examples are curved in back to fit a cylindrical pillar,386 or perhaps it was placed in a liknon.387 This is so far the only mask of this kind found in Corinth, apart from a fragment with similar hair and wreath (see catalogue). Unfortunately, the original context of the mask is not known. It was found on bedrock on the Upper Terrace, where it appears to have been dumped, incorporated into the earth fill used for 378 V-40, II and IV, Corinth XIV, p. 119, no. 1, pl. 29. 379 Bookidis and Fisher 1974, pp. 290-291. 380 Ure 1955, p. 228; Ure 1949, pp. 19-21, fig. 3. 381 Otto 1965, pp. 166-167; LIMC III, 1986, pp. 440-441, esp. no. 158a, pl. 313, s.v.

The mask must already have been broken and discarded by that time, since a few portions, now restored in plaster, are missing. The pottery contexts of the Dionysos masks terminate at the latest in the late 4th to early 3rd century B.C. There is no evidence that they continued to be made in the Hellenistic period, when the sphere of Dionysos was represented by other types, including figurines of Pan and Silenos (see pp. 199-200). OTHER TYPES (C274-C282) Types of the Classical period outside of the categories discussed above consist of satyrs and Pan, a bearded male type wearing the pilos, and dancers of types other than the kalathiskos dancers discussed above (pp. 58-60). SATYRS AND PAN (C274-C277) The satyr figurines are of three sorts. The first (C274) is a widely found piping, squatting type of the 5th century B.C., probably of Rhodian origin; it is known especially in Boeotia and also in Athens.388 Many of these figurines are indifferently molded and finished, making it difficult to determine sources and mechanical relationships precisely. Unless better evidence is forthcoming, it is probably best to assume that each center copied Rhodian prototypes independently. The Corinthian satyrs were made in the Potters' Quarter (see catalogue). C274 is from a pottery context dating from the 6th to the mid-5th century B.C., but the type probably continued to be made at least into the early 4th century B.C. The second satyr figurine type (C275) is typically Corinthian. The head is moldmade, but what remains of the body is handmade. The complete figure originally was squatting, propped up by his tail, which acted as a third leg. The use in the Classical period of the Archaic technique of combined molding and hand modeling is typical of Corinthian workshops and is known in other types as well, such as the seated female C87. Also typical of Corinthian work is the three-legged composition, which is known in other grotesques, such as the Archaic MF-11864.389 While there are no exact parallels for these satyrs in the Potters' Quarter, the interest there in entirely handmade three-legged figurines suggests that the satyrs were made there as well.390 Similar types in London have been dated to the mid-5th century B.C.,391 but it is possible that they continued to be made into the 4th century B.C. The third satyr type is an ithyphallic rider (C276), which probably belongs to a varied 4th- century B.C. Corinthian group showing different grotesque types riding donkeys.392 C276 is somewhat more sophisticated than other members of this group in that it shows torsion. In C277, Pan is shown seated and with crossed goat's legs, both elbows resting on the knees and forearms raised, probably to play the syrinx. A closely similar type was found in a grave dating ca. 400 B.C. in the Athenian Kerameikos,393 together with a piping satyr similar to C274. Since the modeling of C277 is very dull, it could have been mechanically copied from an 388 Examples collected in Corinth XV, ii, p. 143, sub no. 7; Olynthus XIV, pp. 264-265, no. 364; Schurmann 1989, p. 43, no. 92, pl. 19.

Its high, splaying base is a sign of its Classical date. Pan is connected with Demeter and Kore in myth and is a participant in Kore's anodos in vase painting.394 The offering of figurines of satyrs and Pan in the Demeter sanctuary is probably to be understood in the context of fertility imagery395 and of the worship of Dionysos there (see p. 76). BEARDED MALE FIGURINES WEARING THE PILOS (C278-C280) While the satyr figurines are quite straightforward in form and content, a group of bearded figurines wearing the pilos is more puzzling (C278-C280). One of them (C278) is seated on a chair with horizontal projections in back, like the chairs of seated goddess and female votary types (e.g., C71 and C78); the figurine may portray a deity, but his identity is not easily determined. Hephaistos comes to mind, since he often wears a pilos in Greek art, and an unclear object at the lower break of C278 could be a tool held in his right hand. Among the relatively few, and usually later, terracotta figurines representing Hephaistos,396 however, the seated examples are on backless seats and seem to be resting rather than hieratically enthroned. Offerings to Hephaistos might be understandable in a Demeter sanctuary as a request for prosperity in a craftsman's household, but it is worth considering other possible identifications. There are in Corinth other seated, bearded male figurines wearing the pilos. One from the Potters' Quarter holds an empty tray.397 In a similar figurine in Berlin,398 the vessel is better preserved; it seems to have a schematically rendered spool handle at one side and a spout at the other and looks rather like a typical Corinthian mortar. An analogous but beardless seated figurine in Dresden399 holds what may be a mortar and pestle on his lap and a small rodent as well. Perhaps we are to see in these figurines representations of popular deities or local heroes worshiped in the household, represented wearing the headgear of the ordinary countryman; since the imagery of the figurines may suggest grinding, they may have served as patron deities of the grinding of grain and protectors of the grain supply against rodents. To give examples of deities connected with the grinding of grain, Zeus Myleus is thought to have been a patron deity of millers, and, in addition, Hesychios mentions miller deities in Rhodes.400 The pilos would be a suitable attribute, since millers, like other Greek workmen, wore these hats.401 A figurine of such a deity or hero would have been a suitable offering in the Demeter sanctuary. Hermes also is bearded and wears the pilos, but while representations of him would be very appropriate in a chthonic cult, he usually is not shown enthroned. From Medma come bearded heads in the pilos or a conical cap with earflaps; these figurines are thought to represent Hermes Kriophoros.402 Their shaggy beards give them a distinctly rustic appearance and may set them apart from the somewhat more urbane C278-C280, which have shorter, well-trimmed beards. Hades occasionally wears a pilos,403 and his representation enthroned would be natural in a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore. There also could be a connection with approximately contemporary Phoenician figurines of an unnamed seated, bearded god in a conical headdress, 394 Borgeaud 1988, pp. 143-146. 395 On the similar significance of satyr figurines in the Kabeirion, see Kabirenheiligtum V, p. 32. 396 Brommer 1978, pp. 60-63, pls. 30-32. 397 KT-23-1, Corinth XV, ii, pp. 138-139, no. 8, pl. 26; Corinth XV, i, p. 52.

DANCERS (C281, C282) There are two Classical figurines of dancers from the Demeter sanctuary, apart from the kalathiskos dancers already discussed (pp. 58-59). Both figurines seem to have been made under Attic influence. C281 is performing the oklasma. Dancers in a similar pose and costume are usually female and in Athens are thought to be connected with the worship of Dionysos or perhaps Aphrodite;406 a few represent youths, who may be Attis.407 Whatever the correct identification, a number of variants are known, dating from the 5th century B.C. to the Hellenistic period. It is not entirely clear whether C281 is female or male, since the figure is somewhat shapely, but the chest is quite flat. The pose is close to that of a dancer on an Attic figurine vase dated to the second half of the 4th century B.C.408 C281 is such a dull impression and its limbs are so poorly defined that it could have been copied mechanically from such a vase, with no attempt to restore detail by retouch. The drapery style of the figurine is earlier than the vase, however, belonging to the later 5th century B.C., and the high base is normal for figurines of the 5th and earlier 4th centuries B.C. Since the pottery context of the figurine dates from the Archaic period to the late 5th century B.C., if an Attic figurine vase was indeed the source, it must have belonged to an earlier group. If C281 does represent Attis, in the context of the Demeter sanctuary the reference was presumably to Cybele, who sometimes was equated with Demeter (see p. 254). Otherwise, the recipient of this offering would have been either Dionysos or Aphrodite, both of whom were honored at the sanctuary beside Demeter and Kore. The second dancer is C282; the legs of this figurine are not preserved, but a sense of movement in the torso and drapery suggests that it represents a dancer stepping forward. Dancers in this pose are well known in the Classical period, with varying arm positions and drapery arrangements. The best known are Attic or Attic-inspired,409 and there are also a few of reported Corinthian provenience.410 The movement of these dancers tends to be concentrated in the legs and feet, allowing the upper body to remain rather quiet. Perhaps these poses reflect the relatively static nature of this dance, compared with the more active 4th-century B.C. and Hellenistic mantled dancers (see pp. 151-156). C282 is particularly interesting for its combination of Attic-influenced Rich Style drapery with a face of Peloponnesian style, characterized by large, earthy features. This combination, found also in the sculpture of the Temple of Asklepios at Epidauros, is especially northeast Peloponnesian in spirit. A sense of motion is conveyed in the figurine by the puffed, seemingly air-filled chiton folds over the belt, a device developed by Attic sculptors for active figures, such as Nikai and riders.411 The figurine's head is related to Epidaurian sculptural style in the wide mouth, downturned, thick-lidded eyes, and the details of the hair.412 If the connection of the figurine with Epidaurian style has been drawn correctly, the archetype of the figurine should 404 Kharayeb, p. 17, nos.

Taking into account various opinions, that date should be ca. 380-370 B.C.413 The facial type of this figurine reappears in a possible later generation on figurines of Aphrodite or Leda found in the Potters' Quarter and the cave at Pitsa (see catalogue). To determine the nature of the source, it is important to note that in several respects the figurine is different from most other Corinthian figurines. The details of the hair and folds have an unusual delicacy and clarity of definition, perhaps due in part to the harder firing of this piece than was usual in Corinth in this period, but also suggesting a metallic source.414 All the detail was in the mold, not retouched, which is unusual in Corinthian figurines (see p. 17). The head and torso were in the same mold, as was the right arm, even though it was held away from the body. The figurine was not put together from individual parts in the usual way, that is, using a limbless torso archetype and a separate head archetype to prepare partial molds and adding separately made limbs after casts of the head and torso were assembled (see pp. 15-16). Rather, the mold seems to have been lifted in one piece from its archetype. The right arm is attached to the torso with a panel of clay, suggesting that there was a similar attachment in the original. Perhaps the source, then, was metal relief,415 such as an applique on a bronze mirror cover; the size of the figurine is close to that of figures on such covers, and other dancer types are known on mirrors attributed to Corinth.416 A source in relief is supported by the dancer's back, which is simply a smooth, rounded slab of clay wrapped from side to side, while figurines mechanically copied from metallic originals in the round usually have detailed moldmade backs.417 To judge from the style, it is likely that the metallic source was northeast Peloponnesian, if not Corinthian. 413 For discussions of the date, see Delivorrias 1974, pp. 195- 196; Brown 1973, pp. 26-28, both with bibliography; Yalouris 1992, pp. 82-83. 414 E.

Tooling on folds, especially on kolpos, and vertical incisions on mantle fall. Weight on right leg, hip outthrust; left thigh slightly ad- vanced. Left shoulder higher than right, thus arm originally raised; right arm held away from body, precise position un- certain. Hip-length overfold and kolpos are arched over ab- domen.

Wide, flat skirt folds are indicated by vertical incisions just beneath kolpos. Type modified by addition of shoulder- pinned back mantle, pulled forward into deep loops over shoul- ders, hanging behind in thin, stiff panel cut off abruptly at hip level. The raised left arm probably lifted the edge of the man- tle. Large piece, sculptural in style, although rather flat and schematic in execution.

C42 is similar in type but is scarred due to a mold defect; it may be from a parallel mold series. See pp. 35-37. C42 Standing peplos-figurine P1. 6 MF-11668. Lot 2009. Preserved: shoulders to thighs; front and mantle chipped. Missing forearms. Mended. PH. 0.106 (size 3). Fabric 2, buff to orange-buff. White slip. Red paint on back at top. Hollow. Back handmade, flattened. Irregular vent at hip level, ca. 0.037 x 0.024, rectangular at top, oval at bottom. Added: mantle, forearms. Tooling on folds. Large, oval scar on left hip and thigh, probably from defect in mold. Probably mechanically related to C41. Forearms originally extended forward, slightly turned out. Nearly all folds of pe- plos, including wide V-shaped fold at neckline, heavily slashed. Shoulder-pinned back mantle added in thin panel behind left arm and hip, with flap over right shoulder; folds incised. Red paint on back suggests long hair, although no locks of hair are preserved. Perhaps from a mold series parallel to C41, which does not show the scar; this defect is similar to that of C43, which is larger in scale.

Missing arms, most of drapery fall at right side, part of back. Mended. P.H. 0.141 (size 3). Fabric 1, orange-buff to orange, interior orange. Hollow. Back handmade, flattened. Vertical edge of narrow, rectangular vent preserved at hip level. Added: arms, mantle fall at both sides, possibly long locks of hair in back. Tooling on folds. Large, oval scar on left hip and thigh, probably from defect in mold. Scar on left hip and thigh is similar to that of the smaller C42, suggesting a mechanical relationship through a defect in the mold, but proportions of this piece are more elongated, with narrow shoulders, high breasts, long waist. Left arm probably raised to lift mantle; right arm held away from torso. Overfold hem scarcely visible; kolpos hem is horizontal, pouching indicated with gouges. Folds retouched with rough slashes. Coarse workmanship. See pp. 18, 35-37. C44 Standing draped female figurine P1. 6 MF-13646. Lot 2152. Preserved: front-left shoulder to hip, small part of back. PH. 0.083 (size 3).

Added: drapery loop under arm. Tooling on folds. Break at shoulder indicates that arm was raised at sharp angle, as if to hold object on head, probably hydria. Center of overfold plain, falls to just below waist. Two deep, vertical folds at side, flat loop under arm; deep zigzag folds at open side ofpeplos. Vertical skirt folds. If figurine is a hydriaphoros, it would resemble in type the much smaller and later C48; cf. also Winter, Typen I, p. 156, no. 4. Similar in scale to the head C53; C45 originally may have had a head of this type. Venting perhaps similar to C46. See pp. 38, 42. C46 P1. 6 Standing peplos-figurine, probably hydriaphoros MF-14065.

Back handmade, flat; narrow (0.015) return to finished edge, indicating large, rectangular vent. Similar in type to C45, with looped underarm fold, arm probably raised very high. In addition, overfold hem seems lifted high above kolpos, as if responding to raised arm. Traces of two catenaries at center of overfold; vertical folds at sides dropping to zigzag hem. Treatment of back as in C2 and C7. See p. 39. C47 P1. 6 Standing peplos-figurine, with piglet (and hydria?) MF-13863. Lot 1953. Preserved: shoulders to ankles. Missing right arm.

Break indicates right arm originally raised. Left hand originally held fold of skirt out to side. Peplos girded fairly high; overfold falls to top of thighs. Folds of open right side of peplos summarily rendered, with pointed projections under arm. Skirt has tubular, vertical folds but is smooth over left leg. Long locks of hair are crimped horizontally. See p. 39. C50 P1. 6 Standing draped female figurine, perhaps hydriaphoros MF-14062. Lot 891. Preserved: front-right side, breast to hip. Missing arm. PH. 0.059 (size 2). Fabric 1, buff to pinkish orange, interior greenish buff. Hollow. Added: right arm. Hole in shoulder may be for insertion of arm tenon, similar to seated figurine C82, perhaps to strengthen arm in vulner- able position (lifted to balance hydria on head?). Costume a chiton or peplos with mantle around hip. Although the shoulder hole could be a sign of an articulated "doll," Corin- thian figurines with articulated arms usually were not mantled (cf, e.g., C180). See p. 39.

Probable later generation of head in lot 878 (fabric 1). Similar in type: smaller head in lot 4379 (fabric 3); MF-10576 (lot 892) is still smaller, has higher, more flaring polos; one from the diolkos excava- tions (Verdelis 1958, p. 144, pl. 118:2). A mold for this type is in the Corinth collection, MF-3979 (Corinth XII, p. 62, no. 467, pl. 43; the mold does not match exactly any of the figurines in Corinth, perhaps because of heavy retouch or distortions resulting from handling before firing; a complete example in Karlsruhe may be related to this mold, Schurmann 1989, p. 35, no. 67, pl. 14).

Figure of matronly proportions, in sleeved chiton, seated in a very deep chair, thus lap unusually short. Left forearm proba- bly extended forward. Rounded top of chair visible behind left shoulder. Narrow ridging on back probably represents chair construction. For clearer details of chair type, see probable mold sibling KT-8-3 from the Potters' Quarter (Corinth XV, ii, p. 134, no. 50, pl. 28; chair seems to be of wicker, its rounded shape probably similar to chair model KT-55-10: ibid., p. 209, no. 11, pl. 45).

Another probable mold sibling: MF-10340 (lot 870). Similar head: one from Perachora (Perachora I, p. 102, no. 312, pl. 115) is thought to be Attic because of its smooth red fabric, which sounds, however, like Corinthian fabric 2. Similar in type, thought to be Corinthian: one in Paris (Lou- vre III, p. 54, no. D299, pl. 62:b, holding a baby); one in Berlin (Winter, Typen I, p. 141, no. 2b). See pp. 45, 294.

Thick-walled, 0.025-0.06 (at bottom); interior surface irregular. Back seems fully modeled. Either completely handmade or very heavily retouched. Overfold falls to lap, is deeply cut at side with parallel folds slanting toward back; rather flat kolpos lies across lap in scalloped folds. Two deep U-shaped folds at center of overfold. Raised fold at edge of neckline, probably a wide V-shaped fold. Mantle over shoulder in parallel, curving folds, with bunched folds below arm. Since mantle covers back, it originally may have fallen over left shoulder as well. A few skirt folds at inside of sloping thigh. Hem trails over instep; deep U-shaped fold frames ankle. Vertical skirt folds between leg and throne. A few skirt folds still visible at inner side of leg suggest that lower legs were separated. Wide, flat throne leg is rectangular, cut into shape of double palmette (cf. Richter 1966, pp. 23-28, figs. 85-122). Back of B is finished with skirt folds, suggesting that bottom of throne was open. Adjacent to seat, lateral face of back rest shows profile in three degrees. Technique more sculptural than coroplastic; high quality obvious despite poor preservation. See pp. 1-2, 10, 15, 46, 329.

Boy leans slightly to left side, propped on left hand, which supports weight of figure. Left leg folded flat on base; right foot rests on base, knee drawn up; right hand on knee. Little anatomical detail; left hand and feet merge with base, right hand with knee. Round, bald head on short, wide neck. Eyes prominent. Nose wide. Mouth wide; lips thick. Probable mold siblings: MF-10478 (lot 878); MF-10584 (lot 892); one in lot 2145; one in lot 2249 (fabric 1). Possible mold siblings: MF-2905 in the Corinth collection (Corinth XII, p. 38, no. 192, pl. 14); MF-9155 from the Asklepieion (Corinth XIV, p. 141, no. 26, pl. 54). KT-20-4 from the Potters' Quarter (Corinth XV, ii, p. 115, no. 1, pl. 23) and three others mentioned there are so similar that if they were not mold siblings, they were made in closely related molds. Probable later generation: MF-13424 (lot 2156, nearly featureless). It is possible that some of these figurines were made in a mold found in the Potters' Quarter, KH-60 (Corinth XV, i, pp. 105-106, no. 61, pl. 40), since the mold is of suitable pose, facial type, and scale (i.e., slightly larger). The figurines with heads preserved, however, show a different orientation of the head than the mold. Either two different archetypes were involved or perhaps a parallel mold series, in which manipulation of an unfired figurine earlier in the series caused a change in the position of the head. Similar in type: Perachora I, p. 254, no. 295, pl. 114 (listed with East Greek figurines on the basis of parallels from Lindos but seems closer to Corinthian examples). See pp. 68, 69, 72.

Perhaps a later generation of a mold from the Potters' Quarter, KH-64 (Corinth XV, i, p. 106, no. 65, pl. 40); a long ridge indicating the toes of the left foot appears in both, but the base was apparently reshaped.

Similar in pose to C227, but right arm originally was raised. Large, rounded object behind left hand, perhaps a cushion or clump of drapery. A few possible drapery folds at bottom of base in back originally may have reappeared over missing leg and base in front (for the left leg draped in a mantle, see C241 and C244). Faint cord for amulets over left shoulder, looped diagonally over chest (clearer on C237). Almost no neck. Head tilted to right and thrown back. Left side of face apparently defective in mold (eye not detailed; left side of mouth and adjacent cheek and jaw are flattened, as if erased; probably made in mold parallel to that of C237).

Probably made in mold parallel to that of C236; left side of face is fully preserved, but although not flattened, it is distorted, with mouth twisted upward to left. Perhaps the distortion already existed in the archetype and was erased from the mold of C236 before it was fired. Round face with puffed cheeks, dimpled chin. Nose short, wide. Mouth wide; lips thick; grimace probably due to mold defect. The amulet cord also is clearer here; pendant amulets probably originally painted. See pp. 68, 69, 72, 73, 192.

In addition, it will be seen that some new creations of the 4th century B.C. retained a strong 5th-century flavor. By the second quarter of the 4th century B.C., however, figurine types with different sources of inspiration began to appear, linked to Classical types in votive function but created in a different spirit and style. One should perhaps say "styles," since more than one new way of designing figurines emerged, and the creativity continued unabated into the third quarter of the 4th century B.C. The stimuli must have been much the same for Corinthian as for Athenian model makers and coroplasts, that is, the development of new types and styles in 4th-century plastic arts in general and a growing interest during this period in small sculpture for the home, for ritual if not purely decorative purposes.1 The material prosperity documented for the Greek cities in the middle of the 4th century B.C. must have encouraged the production of attractive votive offerings as well.2 The coroplasts' solutions in the two centers were quite different from one another, however, conditioned as they were by earlier local experience and interests. Early Hellenistic coroplastic art is sometimes equated with the so-called Tanagra figurines, which were abundantly produced in Attica and Boeotia and were widely copied elsewhere. Recent research, however, has made it clear that "Tanagras" represent only a part of the history of Hellenistic figurines;3 in Corinth, an interest in "Tanagra" types was certainly subsidiary to others of more local significance. Although a few imported Athenian and Boeotian "Tanagras" have been found in Corinth (e.g., 124 and 148), there is no evidence for a series of local copies or adaptations of such "Tanagra" types, like those found at Morgantina, for example.4 Moreover, when similarities can be traced between Corinthian figurines and "Tanagras," they often involve only one aspect of type or style and are probably better attributed to common source material than direct influence. For example, a certain rounding of outlines, a demure quality, and a sweetness of expression reminiscent of early "Tanagra" figurines can be found in some Corinthian figurines, especially in representations of young women (e.g., Hi), although in pose and drapery arrangement they are not characteristically "Tanagraean." These qualities are in line with the soft, subtle "Praxitelean" sculptural style, which was widely influential in the arts of the time. When recognizable elements of"Tanagraean" pose and drapery arrangement are employed, as in some of the standing mantled women, a more characteristically Corinthian manner of design is evident, stressing greater plastic volume and broader effects, with less emphasis on delicacy of detail. The entrenched local tradition of broadly styled handmade figurines, which began 1 On the importance in Athens of 4th-century B.C. metal statuettes and stone sculpture for the development of "Tana- gra" figurines, see D. B. Thompson 1966, pp. 54-55.

On the increase in the production of votive reliefs in the third quar- ter of the 4th century B.C., see Edwards 1986a, pp. 262-264.

The Corinthian expertise in working clay in sculptural scale, an activity that continued into the Hellenistic period, may also have been a factor in the ability and willingness to design in clay, in a smaller scale, with freedom and panache. Hence, when developing or selecting new types for production, Corinthian workshops often leaned toward drapery arrangements that emphasized plastic form and overall design rather than subtle detail. The play of antithetical tension folds over the surfaces of many "Tanagra" figurines seems to have been foreign to their taste. At times, the Corinthian Hellenistic artisans inclined toward the design solutions of sculptors to such a degree that it is hard to find parallels for their work among the figurines from other places. At the same time, only one actual small-scale copy of a known sculptural type has been identified at Corinth, a copy of Myron's satyr from a 4th-century B.C. context.5 The local workshops, therefore, do not seem to have habitually imitated well-known sculptural types, as did their counterparts in Myrina and Smyrna (see p. 297). This link with sculptural design without direct dependence upon known sculptural types suggests that the larger and better Corinthian Hellenistic figurines may have had sources in clay models prepared locally for makers of bronze statuettes or perhaps studies for stone sculpture (see pp. 14, 343).6 Such models could have been obtained by coroplasts for use as archetypes for figurine production. In determining the chronology of Corinthian Hellenistic figurines, the conventional use of the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. for the beginning of the Hellenistic period is not helpful. The cessation of work in the Potters' Quarter in or near the 320s B.C. merely brought to an end an already outdated production, while new ideas had come into being earlier, in other Corinthian workshops. Dramatic drapery arrangements, the increased representation of female nudity (apart from articulated "dolls"), the successful depiction of people of different ages, the interest in character and atmosphere, and other commonplaces of Hellenistic coroplastic art are part of the branching away from the Classical tradition that began some time in the second quarter of the 4th century B.C. If the beginning of a Hellenistic spirit in Corinthian coroplastic art is to be dated, it happened before the middle of the 4th century B.C. Significantly, the dividing point between Classical and Hellenistic for the forthcoming publication of figurines from the Athenian Agora, which can be dated on objective grounds more closely than the Demeter sanctuary figurines, has been set at ca. 380 B.C.7 Although there are no signs of radical typological or stylistic change in the 320s B.C., some economic difficulty may have been experienced in the coroplastic industry in the later 4th and early 3rd centuries B.C. and more serious difficulty in the middle or third quarter of the 3rd century. The seismic activity of the later 4th century B.C. (see p. 7, note 20) could have disrupted other establishments in Corinth besides those of the Potters' Quarter. In some cases, mechanically related figurines are found in both the poorest fabric 5 and the better fabric 1 (e.g., see catalogue under HI), as if quality varied from one batch of figurines to another because of decreasing control in the workshop. Perhaps the availability or cost of fuel for firing was a factor. Whether the friability of fabric 5 is due to the use of clay of lesser quality or to poor firing, a reduction in workshop standards must be involved. Apart from the potentially damaging effects of earthquakes on workshop structures and personnel, we do not know what may have been the economic effects of the stationing of a Macedonian garrison on Acrocorinth after 338 B.C. or if any access was lost to the accustomed raw materials, either clay or fuel. Still, some good work was done during the earlier part of the 3rd century B.C., new types were introduced, and a real decline in the quantity and quality of production does not seem to have occurred until the middle or third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. 5 Mattusch 1996, pp. 195-196, fig. 6:la, b. 6 Coroplast's Art, p. 58. 7I owe this information to Dorothy B. Thompson.</page><page sequence="141">DISCUSSION 117 STANDING DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES: YOUNG VOTARIES AND RELATED FIGURINES (H1-H47) In this section are discussed representations of young women bearing votive offerings and figurines related to them in type and style. Most of the figurines discussed here carry piglets, torches, flowers, balls, or birds; others are without votive gifts. The costume is usually the peplos, but the chiton with a diagonal mantle is found as well. The youngest girls usually wear the chiton alone. A discussion of hydriaphoroi, who are also votaries from the point of view of function, follows this section. PIGLET CARRIERS The first of the Early Hellenistic groups to be discussed consists of female votary figurines, which usually wear the peplos and carry a piglet. While they are not the earliest of the new Early Hellenistic types, they will be considered first because they continue the cultic function of Classical votary figurines in a new style and spirit. Two of the elements separating them from their Classical counterparts are a clearer distinction of age through greater anatomical naturalism and manipulation of pose, as well as a stronger impression that these figurines must represent mortals rather than deities. One can see at a glance that H1 is in the first bloom of womanhood. The figurine projects the ripe, yet innocent quality of a girl in her middle to late teens, with high, full breasts suggesting physical maturity, but also with a demurely bent head, downcast gaze, sweet facial expression, and girlishly lifted overfold. This gesture of grasping the overfold hem is often associated with youth. It is seen in sculptures of children;8 in a Corinthian figurine in New York, it is reduced to a rolling of the fingers around the overfold hem, suggesting nervous shyness.9 The gesture also could be a deliberate archaism, referring to the pulling aside of the skirt often found in Archaic sculptured female figures,10 in Archaic and Classical mirror caryatids,ll and in lingering Archaic terracotta figurines (e.g., MF-13626).12 It also functions as a compositional device, breaking the downward flow of drapery lines.13 In Greek vase painting, a downcast gaze and a closed compositon, with the arms down at the sides, typically convey the modesty of a respectable woman;14 these features probably should be understood in the same way when found in figurines. The young woman's hair streams over her shoulders, in the manner documented in the worship of Demeter elsewhere in the Greek world.15 The manner of dressing the hair is a powerful symbol, the meaning of which varies among different cultures. It can express one's individual personality, stage of life, place in society, and connection with or dissociation from the prevailing culture; it can have erotic associations or signify mourning; the hair itself can have magical properties. 16 The knotted coiffure of boys and young men has already been mentioned (pp. 62-63), but the rarity of representations in the sanctuary suggests that it was not related to the local cult. The unbound, flowing hair of young women, however, is so prevalent in Early Hellenistic votary figurines that it is fair to give this coiffure some ritual significance, although several overlapping meanings are possible. In the context of the Demeter sanctuary, flowing 8 Vorster 1983, e.g., p. 335, no. 11, pl. 1:1; p. 339, no. 24, pl. 12:1.

Girls approaching sexual maturity also loosened their hair in rituals at Brauron.17 The cutting of long hair sometimes is thought to symbolize the imposition of social control18 or at least the progression from one social stage to another.19 Hence the long hair of the figurines might refer to the cutting and offering of the hair before marriage, as a sign of the institutionalizing of sexual instincts. The hair of married women was normally bound up in a variety of bands or cloths.20 It also has been suggested that the offering of a bride's hair symbolized the death of her previous existence,21 paralleling the loosening of the hair during mourning and the offering of shorn locks at tombs. For the worship of Demeter, an association with burial customs certainly is appropriate, bringing into play her mourning for the lost Kore and the latter's position as the bride of Hades. In H1, the locks of hair flow over the shoulders much more freely than in such figurines of Classical type as C17. The transition from the small head to the narrow shoulders is smoothed by the long hair, and the head thus forms the apex of a narrow pyramid. The overfold sweeps gently into the spreading skirt with scarcely any interruption in outline. Thus, although there is some movement in the tilted head, the hand lifting the overfold, and the bent right leg, the overall impression is essentially static. Even the piglet hangs down heavily. The languid pose is emphasized by the reversed S-shaped curve of the figure in profile, with the head and abdomen forward. The atmosphere is muted, conveying something of the sealed, almost enforced serenity of many "Tanagra" figurines, without showing any elements of their drapery, coiffures, or attributes. The entire group of Early Hellenistic young female votaries from the sanctuary shares this quiescence, both girls just reaching maturity (e.g., H10) and those somewhat older. One should probably see in these figurines a naturalistic rendering of the shyness and introversion of adolescent girls and young women, who had little contact with the outside world, as well as a cultural statement of the approved demeanor for unmarried females in general. H1 conveys an image of a person at a particular stage of life and frame of mind; this information gives a specific context to the piglet and defines its meaning. The figurine suggests not simply a woman bringing an offering to a deity but a young, nubile woman asking for a productive marriage through the gift of a piglet, an offering commonly dedicated to Demeter as a symbol of fertility.22 The term piglet (Xotpoq) also had sexual connotations in colloquial speech. It was employed in Attic comedy to denote the genitalia of immature girls or the depilated parts of mature women.23 The Souda (s.v.) assigns this usage especially to Corinth but seems to be influenced by knowledge of the hetairai of the Aphrodite cult on Acrocorinth. According to Varro (Res Rustica 2.4.9-10), Italian and Greek women used the term in the same way as a symbol of marriage; the passage implies that the pig sacrifice stems from this usage. Regardless of the reliability of the Souda, the usage is likely to have been widespread, since it was known in both Athens and Italy. The frequent equation of women with pigs in Greek literature has led to the suggestion that the pig should be interpreted more fully as representing the simultaneously beneficial and dangerous sexuality of women, particularly the young.24 It is therefore legitimate to see another level of meaning, implicitly sexual, in the offering of a piglet by a young woman. If the figurines carrying piglets do indeed represent brides, they set the age of marriage for females 17 Sourvinou-Inwood 1988, pp. 70-71, note 17, on contexts in which the hair was loosened. 18 Hallpike 1969. 19 Firth 1973, p. 298.

It has been suggested that Sicilian figurines carrying piglets held them head downward to represent women about to hurl the piglets alive into a pit, as at the Athenian Thesmophoria.27 The lack of a suitable pit at the Acrocorinth sanctuary, however, and the carrying of the piglet horizontally or diagonally across the torso by some of the figurines, will not allow this interpretation in the present instance. Further, the participants in the Thesmophoria rituals appear to have been already married and presumably older women. Pit B in Room 3 of the Trapezoidal Building was fire scarred and full of ash. Although it contained pig bones, its small size and the presence of other, nonsacrificial debris in it make its use as a sacrificial receptacle for live piglets somewhat doubtful.28 The frequent offering of piglets is documented, in any case, by the numerous bones of young pigs found in the fill associated with the Rock-cut Platform on the Middle Terrace in Area D. Presumably the dedication occurred in this area, which appears to have been in ritual use until ca. 300 B.c.29 Another documented offering dedicated by brides, the girdle,30 might be suggested by the unbound peplos of some of the votary figurines (e.g., Hi), although others are belted (e.g., H7). Another noteworthy quality of HI is its distinctive facial profile, with a sloping forehead, arched nose, and receding chin (P1. 24), which recalls the profiles of Archaic figurine heads and vase protomes (e.g., MF-12016).31 It is conceivable that a cast was taken from an old mold and reworked before firing to produce a new archetype with updated features but retaining something of the old structure; the unusual depth of the cranium and nape, which is characteristic of some Archaic vase protomes, might be explained in this way.32 Other Early Hellenistic figurine heads, belonging to different types, show a similar facial profile, although they are normal in depth: for example, the mantled figurine H102 and a male figurine from the Potters' Quarter.33 The small group H1-H4 and the fragments related to it represent three generations of at least two closely related mold series, using at least two different head molds. Although the members of this group are closely similar in both type and stylistic detail, technical differences in retouch and venting suggest that more than one workshop may have been involved in the production. A likely workshop mate for HI can be found in a completely different category of figurine, in the nude youth H299, which shares its distinctive profile and the unusual depth of the head, as well as the pose of the right arm. While it seems to have been common enough practice to transform a male head to a female by altering the coiffure, and attach it to a female torso (see p. 159), in the present instance the rendering in both HI and H299 of the head and torso in one mold indicates that the transformation occurred when the archetypes were prepared, and they are part of the same iconographic series.34 Another figurine (H9) can be added to this workshop group (Workshop H, p. 346) through an error made in the molding of HI; the coroplast apparently was missing the correct back mold and substituted instead a mold very similar to the back of H9; since this type is belted, the mold was entirely inappropriate. The level of skill of the coroplasts in this workshop does not seem to match that 25 On the literary evidence for age at marriage, see R.

Apart from the error in H1, H9 is marred by a distortion in the face that occurred during molding, and H299 has very little retouch. This discrepancy speaks for the production of archetypes as a distinct craft, not necessarily in workshops producing figurines. The stylistic date of HI would be the last quarter of the 4th century. It was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Survivals of this and the related types discussed below lasted well into the 3rd century B.C. The group may have come into production when the derivatives of Classical votary types produced in the Potters' Quarter were no longer available. The composition of the peplos, with its lifted overfold hem, recalls a Roman marble statuette in the Vatican thought to copy an original by Euphranor dated ca. 335-325 B.c.35 Since the torso type of H1-H4 also is known in another statuette, a bronze in Paris, with attributes of a Muse,36 it is possible that Corinthian coroplasts were stimulated to develop new molds for votary figurines in connection with new archetypes created by a skilled model maker. A connection with bronze is suggested by the fact that this group is detailed fully in the round, with molded backs, a technique thought to show dependence on metal.37 While this interpretation is well taken, it is not clear how one could distinguish a well-made figurine descending from a good archetype from which both front and back molds were taken, from one mechanically copied from a metal statuette. Fine "metallic" details are a help,38 and figures in precious metal would have been delicately detailed, but bronze statuettes do not necessarily share this characteristic and, on the contrary, are often fairly crude. Further, a coroplast could have used a mold taken from the front of a metal figure and added a handmade back, or he could have taken a mold from a metal relief, for which a back would have had to be improvised (see C282). In addition to the catalogued figurines, more than two hundred examples of young female votaries of this and related types were counted in the lots,39 making them the major new introduction of the Early Hellenistic period. Otherwise votaries carrying piglets are known in Corinth only in the Early Classical C1 and the degenerate Classical C47, although figurines of pigs alone also were dedicated (e.g., the Classical V1). Perhaps the continuous production of piglet carriers in Sicily during the Classical period and well into Hellenistic times stimulated a revival of the subject in a new style in Corinth, at a time coeval with Timoleon's period of activity in Sicily.40 The expedition to Sicily was undertaken with the protection of Demeter and Kore (Diodoros 16.66.3-4; Plutarch, Timoleon 8.1), and it is possible that this patronage led to visits to shrines where the use of such votives was observed. Figurines of votaries carrying piglets also were popular in Argos in the Classical period and were exported to Corinth (see pp. 286-287). It is perhaps significant that the Argive workshops appear to have been turning out these votary figurines only in degenerate form, if at all, by the time the Corinthian workshops began their own production, perhaps to compensate for the loss of the Argive product. 35 Todisco 1993, pl. 216; Palagia 1980, pp. 23-25, fig. 35 (the Uffizi "Hygieia" type). A Hellenistic marble head (S-1820) and a piglet (S-1825) in the Corinth collection are thought to be remnants of a type similar to the figurines, although in the sculpture the head wears a scarf (Sturgeon 1998). A fragment of terracotta sculpture from the sanctuary (SF-65-22) shows a hand holding the hind leg of a piglet, but its date and the sculptural type to which it belonged are still uncertain (publication forthcoming by Nancy Bookidis). 36 Babelon and Blanchet 1895, p. 56, no. 122. The head of this statuette recalls that of a figurine in Paris (Louvre I, p. 119, no. C228, pl. LXXXVI), which is probably Corinthian (see p. 27). For a good photograph of the bronze statuette, showing the similarity of the fold pattern with that of HI, see Babelon 1929, pp. 25-26, no. 13, pl. XII. This bronze has been connected with the "Nemesis" type with lifted overfold: Linfert-Reich 1971, pp. 105-116. 37 D. B. Thompson 1966, pp. 54-55. 38 E. R. Williams 1976, p. 43, no. 5. 39 This number is approximate, since small fragments can be confused with the Middle Hellenistic piglet carriers (e.g., H395), which may represent priestesses. Further, some frag- ments do not preserve the piglet and have been identified with this group on the basis of similarity of head type and drapery. 40 The Sicilian material is collected in Sguaitamatti 1984. On Timoleon's impact on the worship of Demeter and Kore in Sicily, see Hinz 1998, pp. 229-232.</page><page sequence="145">DISCUSSION 121 Some comment regarding the dress of these votaries may be in order, since "Tanagra" figurines, which are thought to reflect the fashion in dress current in the Early Hellenistic period, wear not the peplos but the chiton and mantle.41 Although there is no evidence for a code of cultic dress regulations at the Acrocorinth sanctuary,42 the young women may be wearing the peplos as a ritual dress, suitable for the occasion of offering a votive gift, especially one in connection with the traditional business of marriage. Regional, social, or economic considerations, however, probably also influenced the choice of dress. The "Tanagras" probably reflect the fashion of Athens, where they are believed to have originated. The simple peplos could have remained the standard garment elsewhere or perhaps was the dress of ordinary women, the less well-to-do, and servants, contrasting with the more sophisticated attire of the wealthy.43 The fragmentary H5 records a variant in which the overfold hem is not lifted, and the base is different from that of HI, being low, rectangular in front, and rounded in back. The clean finish of the hem of the fragment H6 suggests that it could have been attached to yet another type of base, a flat plaque like V39. Related in spirit to H1-H4, but different in composition, are H7-H9. A technical connection has been established between the two groups through the back molds of H and H9 (see p. 119). The faces of these two figurines also may be technically related, although distorted in molding in the latter. Also comparable in these two groups are the youthful, demure look, the essentially frontal pose eased by the slight forward movement of the abdomen, and the tilted head. In both, the loose stream of locks of hair over the shoulders contributes to a gradual, pyramidal transition from the small head to narrow shoulders and then to a gently spreading skirt. In both groups, the figures seem to have been set into, rather than on, the round or oval molded bases. In both groups, one also finds a similar compositional device, the breaking of the figure's verticality with a diagonal form, either the line of th the lifted overfold hem, as in H1, or the arms cradling the piglet, as in H9. The peplos or chiton continues to have a long overfold, but in H9 it is girded just below the breasts; the curving belt accentuates the forward movement of the abdomen, contributing to the languid look of the pose. The piglet is carried across the torso rather than at the side, its head cradled in the crook of the left arm, the left hand supporting its chest, and the right grasping its left rear leg. The overall proportions of H9 are more slender, although the pyramidal outline of the figure re mains constant in both groups. H7 and H8 follow H9 in composition but use a different head type, more like that of H2, although not mechanically related. The sloping profile characteristic of HI is absent, the cheeks and jaw are very full, and the forehead is ogival in shape, but in spite of the formal differences, a similar spirit can be discerned in the small mouth, very slightly and sweetly smiling, and in the overall impression of gentle girlishness. The garments worn by these two figurines have short sleeves and technically should be called chitons, but the cloth does not seem to be thinner than a peplos, and the manner of girding is the same as in H9; perhaps they wear a chiton beneath the peplos. The one feature of dress that is distinctive here is the long-tailed knot on the belt, also known in better Corinthian renderings (H144 and H145). H10 shows many of the same qualities of composition and demeanor, but is more rigidly frontal and has a flatter chest and less suggestion of blooming womanhood than HI. This version of the votary with piglet seems to have been constructed on a torso type used also for representations of very young girls without offerings, such as H45, but utilizes a facial type close to H8. The rather childish, slender proportions make the figurine more columnar than pyramidal, but the similarities are sufficient to link it closely to the foregoing votaries. 4' On the basis of sculptural evidence, the peplos is thought to have been old-fashioned by the Hellenistic period: Ridgway 1984, p. 56. 42 On such codes, see Mills 1984. 43 The peplos can sometimes be found on 4th-century B.C. red-figured vases in scenes of everyday life. An analysis of who wears it and in what contexts might be instructive.</page><page sequence="146">122 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS The piglet carriers discussed above were the most popular types in the sanctuary during the Early Hellenistic period. Their archetypes must have been created at about the same time. Although there is not enough evidence to assign them all to the same workshop, their makers must have shared materials or at least were familiar with one another's work. There are also more degenerate versions, whose pedigrees are difficult to determine, but they are clearly in some way dependent upon the popular types. H 1 may be a degenerate version of H9, with an oversized head that spoils the original composition. H12 and H13 taken together constitute a very poor version, with an unusually large piglet held horizontally across the chest, and a thick overfold hem with a crudely retouched kolpos. All the preserved examples of this type are equally crude, suggesting either that it was improvised by a poor workshop or that it was the degenerate end of a better mold series, the better, earlier generations of which are missing from the archaeological record. H14 is a smaller example of this crude type, but it is not demonstrably from the same mold series. The sloping profile of its head links it to H1; since it is only marginally smaller than this better piece, it cannot be a later generation but probably was made by a craftsman of limited skill, using a related head mold. The rather poor fragment H15 holds a large, horizontal piglet over a high-girded chiton; it may have been developed from a torso type similar to H37. The poorer workshops appear to have had access to some of the same materials as the better ones, or they copied as best they could. It is even possible that some of the poorest examples of popular types were homemade improvisations based upon commercially available types. In addition, there are several distinctive larger votary figurines (H16, H17, H19, and H20) that bear some relation to the popular types representing votaries with piglets, although the differences seem great enough to preclude the idea that they are mechanically related earlier generations. Of very good quality, they seem to represent a level of creativity akin to some of the larger and better figurines of the Classical period. That is, they are explorations of the variants possible within a limited overall design, out of which more popular types sometimes developed. H16, which wears the peplos over a chiton, is related to a quietly standing 3rd-century B.C. female figurine type with both arms at the sides, of which there is a complete example in New York.44 H37 may be a considerably later generation of the New York figurine, which is of the same scale as H16 and shows a similar pose of the right arm and drapery pattern on the overfold. The head type is different,45 but in both cases the head is larger in proportion to the torso than in H1, resulting in a less pyramidal composition. Both seem to have been developed from the same or related archetypes, H16 being adapted for use as a votary with piglet by altering the position of the left arm and adding long, streaming locks of hair bound with a fillet. Perhaps both H16 and the New York figurine were ultimately derived from a type related to a mold found in Corinth in the South Stoa (PI. 77), which shows a long-haired girl in a chiton and peplos, pyramidally composed, with both arms at her sides.46 The head type of H16 is different from the other piglet carriers, having a more mature, alert face, generally similar to the isolated heads H186 and H187. These heads, however, have a different coiffure and wear the stephane; they therefore probably did not belong to votary figurines. H16 recalls in proportions and structure a monumental sculpture, the Apollo Patroos, which dates ca. 330 B.C.; the general resemblance is easiest to see in small-scale copies, such as a marble statuette from the Athenian Agora.47 The figurine, however, probably was made in the 3rd century B.C., even if derived from a late-4th-century B.C. composition. 44 The Metropolitan Museum, inv. no. 07.286.21: Coro- plast's Art, p. 125, no. 18. 45 The head of the New York figurine is similar in type to C136, H227, and H228. 46 MF-8993: Broneer 1947, p. 242, pl.

H17 also shows a pyramidal outline but is considerably more conservative in the greater stiffness of the torso and frontality of the head. The peplos shows a kolpos quite low on the thigh, unlike the other votaries. The folds are broad and flat, resembling in this respect the figurines of young girls (H43 and H45). The most characteristic feature of the drapery is a triangular pleat at the neckline, folded over to the left side. The face does not quite match any of the others, although it is typically Corinthian in its narrow, straight-sided shape. H21 repeats the torso type but in combination with a head that is a later generation of H19 and H20. H19 and H20 with their numerous mold siblings represent another popular votary type but one that followed a different direction. A visual impression of torsion is lent to the composition by the opposing directions of the head, which is turned to the right, and the left arm, which is bent and pulled well back. However, the torso, as far as it is preserved, does not actually twist. There is a clear connection with the smaller H1-H4 in the relatively narrow-shouldered, high-breasted torso, with the overfold spreading toward the wide hips. The fold pattern of the open side of the peplos is also similar. The knuckles of the left hand rest on the hip, however, and the overfold hem was not lifted at the left side. Although a piglet could have been held head downward in the right hand, none is preserved in the fragmentary figurines. The facial type, with its heavy jaw, full cheeks, and earthy features, is somewhat Magna Graecian, although specific parallels are elusive. The fragmentary H22 seems to be yet another variant, in which the left arm is relaxed at the side. In spite of differences in arm position and facial type, it is likely that the archetypes of H19 and H20 and of H1-H4 were in some way related. The similarities in basic composition and proportions are strong; these may have been the fundamental elements in the creation of the archetypes, determining the overall appearance of the torso, while permitting variety through the use of different heads and through the alteration of arm positions and drapery arrangements. Some imported Argive figurines of votaries carrying piglets also were found in the sanctuary (I1, 16-18, see pp. 286-287). One of these (I1) is of Classical date, while the others are Early Hel- lenistic; the latter, which hold the piglet diagonally across the torso, are of rather poor quality and have little observable link with the Corinthian figurines apart from their general type. Following the chronology of Argive figurines (see p. 287), they should date within the 4the century B.. and seem to be the most degenerate examples yet found. It is possible that they predate the Corinthian Hellenistic piglet carriers and that their demise contributed to the introduction of new local types. If the foregoing analysis of the mechanical and stylistic relationships among the piglet carriers is somewhat confusing, it illustrates, as did the discussion of articulated "dolls" (pp. 50-53), the complexities of workshop organization and practice and allows some further insight. There seems to have been a common fund of workshop materials, shared in different ways and altered for differ- ent purposes. The industrial system reflected here seems to have involved the following elements: (1) the production of archetypes by skilled model makers, in multiple copies and variants; (2) the acquisition of such archetypes, or of molds of complete or partial figures already taken from the archetypes, by craftsmen of differing levels of skill; (3) the consequent sharing of these typologically related materials by craftsmen in different workshops, or their use by different craftsmen in the same workshop; and (4) the free alteration of detail and the creative mixing of different head and torso types within individual workshops. The network of figurine types and styles created thereby is nearly impenetrable, but the result was a vigorous and original coroplastic industry. A figurine of unknown provenience but probable Corinthian manufacture, in the Liebieghaus Museum,48 takes this votary type in another direction. A mantle is added around the young woman's hips and legs, and she carries a poppy scepter rather than a piglet. The head is quite like 48 Bol and Kotera 1986, pp. 136-138, no. 70.</page><page sequence="148">124 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS that of H9, and the narrow, cylindrical base also links this figurine to the piglet carrier group. The good condition of this figurine points to its discovery in a tomb, and the alterations to the type, which may now represent Kore, may have been made for a clearer funerary significance. TORCH BEARERS Five figurines (H23-H27) represent four different versions of a female figure carrying a torch. Since there is so little consistency among the members of this small group, it is a reasonable conclusion that the torch bearer was not an important votive type in the sanctuary but was now and again improvised from existing materials. The best preserved (H23) was made from a face mold very similar to HI, but frontally composed, and from a mold for a full-breasted torso in a high-girded chiton similar to H9. It is remarkable how these elements, composed more hieratically, result in a figurine lacking the sweet, demure air of the piglet carriers. H24 wears a belt like that of the votary H7, with a knot and long ties, but in spite of the similarity of dress, the torso is once again more stiffly frontal. Perhaps the bearing of a torch, suggesting a deity or a cult attendant49 rather than a votary, explains the difference. Torch bearers in the context of this sanctuary certainly could represent Kore or Demeter.50 H23 so closely parallels the votaries that one thinks of a human cult attendant rather than a deity, but the remaining torch bearers are too fragmentary to identify. A fragmentary Sam Wide group plate from the sanctuary shows a woman holding aloft a torch and a stalk of wheat, which must refer to Demeter;51 perhaps this figure represents a cult attendant. The torch that showed the way to Sicily for Timoleon was said by Plutarch (Timoleon 8.3) to resemble the torch used in the mysteries. At any rate, the figurines certainly make reference to the chthonic deities through the attribute of the torch. The "priestess" type of the Middle Hellenistic period (pp. 250-255) also carries a torch. It is possible that an oblique reference to marriage is intended, but the torch-lit processions documented in marriage ceremonies did not take place in sanctuaries but accompanied the bride to her new home.52 Postholes found beside the monumental stairway in the sanctuary could have been used to hold torches for nocturnal ceremonies.53 The torches on the figurines vary in size and shape and in the way they are held. In H23 the torch is short, thick, and held diagonally across the torso. In H26 and H27 it is thinner and is cradled more or less diagonally in the right arm; H26 may hold a flower as well. H24 and H25 may be the upper and lower torso of the same type. Here the torch also is cradled in the right arm but vertically, and it is thick, long, and composed of bundled reeds; the flame burns unrealistically close to the hair and shoulder of H24. In this respect, the differently attired Middle Hellenistic "priestess" type with torch, polos, and piglet (e.g., H395) is recalled, as are 4th-century B.C. mantled figurines from Nisyros, with polos and long torch, thought to represent Kore.54 Unfortunately, only one of the torch carriers (H27) was found in a chronologically useful context, terminating in the late 4th to early 3rd century B.C. FLOWER CARRIERS The two flower carriers (H28 and H29) also differ from one another in type; the former carries a heap of blossoms, perhaps to be identified as wild roses from their scalloped outlines, in the overfold of her garment,55 and the latter holds a garland across the front of the torso. H28 probably should be reconstructed with the back of the peplos overfold lifted to shoulder 49 The dadouchos at Eleusis is sometimes considered a torch bearer, but the evidence for the connection of this (male) cult functionary with torches is somewhat vague; see Clinton 1974, pp. 48-49, note 15. 50 For a useful list of representations of Persephone bearing a torch, see Morgantina, pp. 103-104, note 12; for Demeter, p. 104, note 13. 51 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 135-136, no. 295, fig. 35. 52 On the use of torches at weddings, see Oakley and Sinos 1993, p. 26. 53 Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 201. 54 Louvre I, p. 105, nos.

Kore was associated with flowers both in myth, since she was gathering flowers when Hades abducted her, and in votives dedicated to her.57 The Corinthian figurines, which unfortunately are fragmentary, could represent either Kore or, more likely, votaries offering freshly gathered flowers in commemoration of her marriage to Hades. Flowers are particularly associated with Kore in the Lokroi pinakes representing abductions.58 Perhaps there also is a connection with the literary use of the flower as a metaphor for virginity.59 The rose, however, often is the flower of Aphrodite;60 in Greek art it is applied to Attic figurine vases in great profusion,61 and the iconography of these vessels emphasizes the circles of Aphrodite and Dionysos. Since the worship of Aphrodite at the sanctuary is suggested by the substantial number of figurines representing her, it is possible that the votary H28 was carrying rose blossoms in her honor rather than Kore's. A Ist-century B.C. epigram connects roses with a girl's approaching marriage; no deity is named.62 Earlier flower carriers from the sanctuary include lingering Archaic "korai" (MF-13627, MF-12862, MF-10957); the right hand of the "Spes" type (MF-13626, MF-13628) was pierced to insert a flower.63 A figurine in Paris, probably Corinthian and mechanically related to the Classical survivals C7 and C8 (see p. 27), lifts the peplos overfold to carry fruit or flowers.64 The overfold-lifting motif, presumably for the same purpose, is also found in a small bronze figure from Temple Hill.65 BALL CARRIERS The Early Classical peplos-figurine C4 carries a ball; the figurines discussed here, however, are not survivals of that type but new creations. H30 wears a chiton girded fairly high, in the 4th-century B.C. fashion, and from the flatness of the chest seems to be prepubescent. H31 and H32 are Early Hellenistic in their slender proportions and sloping shoulders, but they retain a Classical frontality of pose. Taken together, they preserve a ball carrier whose breasts are small but already developed. The young woman offers the ball in her outstretched right hand. She wears a mantle draped in loose diagonal folds from the left shoulder to the right hip. The chest looks nude in H31, but a few faint folds of a chiton sleeve in H32 and clearer sleeve folds on a better-preserved example in Athens66 are evidence of a garment beneath the mantle. The clarity with which the legs stand out from the drapery suggests that the archetype may have been constructed from a nude male type similar to C188-C190, with skirt folds added around the legs. The semidraped youth C201 shows similarly defined legs beneath the drapery and also carries a ball. The head of H31, with its small, round face and projecting tuft of hair at the top, is like that of Classical articulated "dolls" such as C127 and C159, and the mitten-shaped hand recalls "dolls"' hands such as C122. The type is probably best explained as a pastiche put together at the Potters' Quarter in a workshop that made both articulated "dolls" and nude male figurines; in fact, two examples of this type were found at the Potters' Quarter (see catalogue). H31 and three mold siblings were found in a pottery context terminating at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., but a better terminus ante quem for this type is provided by the destruction of 56 As in Winter, Typen I, p. 78, no. 3. 57 On the association of Kore with flowers, see Sourvinou- Inwood 1978, p. 109, h; Friedrich 1978, p. 164. 58 Sourvinou-Inwood 1978, p. 109, h; Priickner 1968, pp. 70-72. 59 Carson 1990, pp. 146-148. 60 On the association ofAphrodite with flowers, see Friedrich 1978, pp. 74-75.

H33 shows a similar costume but is too fragmentary for closer identification. Its flat chest could suggest a prepubescent girl but in this case also could be ascribed to poor workmanship. The seated female figurine C78, of 4th-century B.C. date, is another ball carrier. Although ball games are known in ritual contexts, particularly in the worship of Aphrodite,67 the small number of ball carriers found in the Acrocorinth sanctuary is not likely to be evidence of such a ritual, even when expanded by the group of figurines representing the ball game called "ephedrismos" (see pp. 200-201). Rather, the balls are probably best understood as examples of the toys customarily dedicated to different deities by girls before marriage and by boys as souvenirs of their adolescence.68 Balls appear to have been dedicated to Kore at Lokroi in a context that was both nuptial and chthonic.69 BIRD CARRIERS The cultic association of the bird with Kore and Aphrodite has already been mentioned (p. 43), and figurines of birds have been found at the Demeter sanctuary, including the Classical V9. Several lingering Archaic "korai" also hold birds (e.g., MF-13642, MF- 11219).70 Classical figurines carrying birds include both standing (C1 and C6) and seated (C77) types. It is therefore a little surprising that there is no evidence for a consistent series of Hellenistic votaries carrying birds to parallel the piglet carriers. The bird carriers H34 and H35 bear little resemblance to either the Early Classical standing votary C6 or the seated C77. H34 wears a chiton and diagonal mantle and carries a bird with outspread wings; she has the undeveloped body of a young girl. An earlier generation found in the Potters' Quarter (see catalogue) locates the source of this figurine and provides a terminal date in or near the 320s B.C., when the Potters' Quarter workshops closed. H35 was probably also a Potters' Quarter product. A strange pastiche, wearing an apparently masculine costume that leaves the legs and chest bare but with feminine breasts, it is probably not a hermaphrodite but a female figurine built upon a male type less successfully than H31. The feet rest on a small plinth projecting from a backdrop, as in the nude Classical youth C188. A chiton originally may have been added by painting over the chest and legs. VOTARIES WITHOUT OFFERINGS H36 is somewhat anomalous in type and is included with the votaries by virtue of its subject, scale, and drapery arrangement. The small figurine represents a young woman in a chiton and diagonal mantle, with the left arm akimbo. To that extent it resembles H31 and H32, but the right hand at the side definitely held no offering. Nevertheless, the general impression of youth and quietude, as well as the long hair, suggests a votary. Although the fabric of this figurine and of its mold siblings is somewhat coarser than usual, it seems to be Corinthian, a product of a workshop separate from the Potters' Quarter and later in date, specializing in small, thick-walled figurines. Other figurines similarly constructed include H38-H40 and H42. The coarse fabric taken together with the slender proportions, sloping shoulders, small head, and the use of a single mold for the entire figurine and its base, all suggest a date in the 3rd century B.C. Determining the age of a young person represented in a figurine is something of a prob- lem.71 There are two clear age groups among the female votaries: (1) prepubescent girls under 67 Kossatz-Deissmann 1978, pp. 38-39; Simon 1983, pp. 40-42, with bibliography; Schneider-Herrmann 1971. 68 Anthologia Palatina 6.280 (a girl dedicates to Artemis before her wedding a ball, a tambourine, a hairband, her hair, and clothing; see p. 49); 6.282 (a boy gives to Hermes as gifts of adolescence a ball, a strigil, clothing, and a bow and arrows); 6.309 (a boy similarly gives a ball, a rattle, knucklebones, and a top). 69 Sourvinou-Inwood 1978, p. 108, c, with bibliography; Prtickner 1968, pp. 47-50. 70 Publication forthcoming. 71 On determining the ages of girls in vase painting on the basis of their physical characteristics, see Sourvinou-Inwood 1988, pp. 33-37.</page><page sequence="151">DISCUSSION 127 ten-twelve years of age, such as H43, characterized by a flat chest and chunky torso without a clearly defined waist; and (2) fully mature young women in their middle to late toteens, such as H1, characterized by their high, firm breasts, and well-defined waistsss and hips. Between these two groups there is a gray area of figurines such as H10, which have somewhasot flat chests but have lost the childlike stockiness and have slender waists. It is possible that these figurines were intended to depict adolescent girls, but unfortunately they are not of the best workmanship, and one must keep in mind that in figurines contour as well as detail can be lost in successive generations or in the clumsy handling of less-skilled artisans. Further, the habit of adapting types for purposes for which they were not originally intended could confuse the issue. H16 seems a little fuller figured than the other votaries and hence more mature, but the pose, coiffure, and piglet should securely fix the subject as youthful. The figure in the mold from the South Stoa (Pi. 77) from which H16 may ultimately derive (see pp. 252-253) is heavily built and wide hipped, yet it too must represent a young woman, by virtue of the costume and pose. Clearly the identification of age groups must rest on all the attributes of figurines, not only on physical characteristics. H43-H45 show the undeveloped figures of girls of prepubescent age. They carry no offerings but press the empty left hand flat against the abdomen. Of the figurines of girls who seem a little older, perhaps already adolescent, without offerings (H37-H41), H40 and perhaps also H38 have the same hand-to-abdomen gesture.72 The meaning of the gesture becomes clear in light of three female rim ornaments on an Archaic Corinthian vessel, in which the left hand is placed across the abdomen and the right hand is at the breast; the combination of gestures clearly evokes the bearing and nourishing of children.73 The hand to abdomen is the "universal gesture of the expectant mother" and is widely known, especially in a large class of Phoenician figurines representing pregnant women.74 If the similarity in the gesture implies a similarity of meaning, the Corinthian figurines could suggest that girls of prepubescent and pubescent age participated in rituals of the sanctuary intended to orient them toward the next stage of their lives, the physical maturity that would make marriage and motherhood possible.75 If this interpretation is correct, the cult could have contained an element of social conditioning. Like the rituals and myths of the Sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron, which involved girls of prepubescent age, the control of emerging female sexuality for the sake of familial and social stability could have been an aspect of the Demeter cult in Corinth.76 One could reasonably expect this function to be absorbed into a cult of Demeter Epoikidie, if the Corinthian household was understood as a microcosm of society. These figurines of children carry a significance quite different from that of the seated children previously discussed (pp. 68-73). The girls have survived the rigors of babyhood and early childhood and are equated in pose and dress with their fully mature elders, perhaps in the hope of a safe arrival at adulthood and a proper discharge of the duties of womanhood. It must be stressed, however, that the number of figurines in this group is small. The only possible surviving Classical precursor of the standing girl type is the fine statuette C34, which probably represents a prepubescent girl. A figurine of excellent quality found in 72 A female figurine from a Corinthian grave dated to the last quarter of the 4th century B.C. (MF-11558) makes a sim- ilar gesture, but she may be holding something in her hand: Pemberton 1985, p. 296, no. 3, pl. 83. An example from the Thesmophorion at Eretria is thought to hold an unidentified object: Eretria, pp. 28, 77, no. 376, pl. 21. 73 Gabrici 1927, cols. 317-319, pls. LXXXV, LXXXVI:10. 74 Treasures of the Holy Land, pp. 174-175, no. 88, with bibliography; Culican 1969, pp. 35-45. The gesture is also known, for example, among Archaic Etruscan bronzes, where it is thought to denote fertility (E. Richardson 1976, p. 24; I thankJean M. Turfa for this reference). 75 For small girls portrayed on Corinthian vases participat- ing in rituals together with women, see Jucker 1963, p. 53, pl. 20:2.

It is noteworthy that in this sanctuary of fertility goddesses, in which figurines of women were such common dedications, representations of pregnancy are confined to the swollen abdomens of comic types (e.g., H360 and H362).78 To be sure, representations of pregnancy are rare in Greek art, perhaps because of aesthetic considerations or because the pregnant woman was thought to be very vulnerable79 and direct representations of the condition might be unlucky. It is conceivable, however, that their absence in the Demeter sanctuary points to the greater concern of the cult with the ability to conceive children and nurture them successfully than with actual childbirth (see pp. 70-71). Two female figurines (H37 and H39) stand quietly with both arms at the sides, a pose already noted in a Corinthian figurine in The Metropolitan Museum (see p. 117, note 9), with a well-known precedent in the Parthenon frieze procession.80 Both of these figurines have slender proportions, sloping shoulders, high breasts, and high-girded garments with long overfolds comparable to H9 and H10. It is unclear whether this simple pose has some significance. It is also known in female figurines from the Thesmophorion at Eretria.81 It does project a passivity perhaps deemed desirable in young women, but its simplicity could have a technical origin, in that the torso mold, with arms so close to the sides, was conveniently complete and required no additions. In one version (H41), the arms stop at the biceps and apparently never were added to the torso at all, even in the archetype. This figurine represents the nadir of the group and may date well into the 3rd century B.C. None of the figurines preserves the legs, but it is possible that H42, the lower part of a figurine with a long overfold and a round base, originally belonged to a similar type. H44 shows technical similarities with the hydriaphoros head H50 and the head in a melon coiffure H223; these figurines may have been made in the same workshop (Workshop J, p. 346). In two figurines (H46 and H47), a mantle is draped over the girl's chiton. In H46, the mantle is rolled around the hips and covers the skirt, recalling similarly draped 3rd-century B.C. stone sculptures of girls holding birds in the left hand.82 The left forearm of H46 is missing, but the arm must have been bent to clear the mantle roll, and the hand could have held an offering. The little girl from Brauron holding a rabbit also comes to mind.83 In H47, the mantle is worn around the shoulders and arms like a shawl, a "Tanagraean" scheme known in numerous variants.84 Although it is a rather roughly made piece, H47 recalls early Attic "Tanagra" figurines in its proportions and rather tubular folds.85 This comparison could place the archetype of H47 in the third quarter of the 4th century B.C. CHRONOLOGY OF VOTARY FIGURINES The dates of the pottery lots with which the votaries are associated, as well as technical connections with other figurines, suggest that most of the votary types were in use during the second half of the 4th century B.C. and that some continued well into the 3rd. Those made in 77 For several figurines in this deposit, drain 1971-1, see C. K. Williams and Fisher 1972, pp. 162-163. 78 The only possible pregnant figurine from the Demeter sanctuary, apart from grotesques, is 159, a very poorly made piglet carrier perhaps distorted in molding rather than preg- nant and probably an import. The articulated "doll" C 115 has a fleshy abdomen, but it sags, and the figurine therefore proba- bly is intended to be obese rather than pregnant. MF-3456 in the Corinth collection (Corinth XII, p. 35, no. 153, pl. 10, found at Penteskouphia) is nude, has a swollen abdomen, and seems to be a grotesque. There is also a nude example from the cave at Pitsa, EAA VI, 1965, p. 206, fig. 229 center, s.v. Pitsa (A. K. Orlandos), but it is uncertain whether it is Corinthian. 79 R.

Those from pottery contexts terminating in the late 4th or early 3rd century B.C. are HI, H7, a mold sibling of H9 (see catalogue), Hll, H14, H20, H21, H27, and H46. These figurines include all the variants of the votaries with piglet except H16. From a pottery context terminating a little later, in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C., is H39, which has both arms pressed to the side of the torso. It is likely that H16, which is similarly composed, belongs to this period as well. These types may have first evolved in the early 3rd century B.C. or at the earliest at the end of the 4th. A 3rd-century B.C. date also works well for the related figurine in The Metropolitan Museum (see p. 128). H44 is the latest, from a pottery context of the middle to second half of the 3rd century B.C. STANDING DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES: HYDRIAPHOROI (H48-H51) A few hydriaphoroi carry on the earlier tradition (see pp. 38-42). H49 recalls the Classical C51 in the solid panel of clay joining the arm and head; the style is updated, however, the narrow, sloping shoulders pointing to an Early Hellenistic date. The elongated proportions of H48, which originally may have balanced a hydria on the head with the raised right arm, also suggest a Hellenistic date; the arched overfold recalls the degenerate Classical C42. The head H50 resembles the Classical C53 in supporting the foot of a hydria without an intervening head ring, but it has the youthful face and long, unbound hair of the votaries discussed above. The hydria of H49 is somewhat taller than its Classical predecessor, and consequently the arm is raised higher. The base of H51, a hydria perhaps broken from the head of a figurine, is very narrow; by comparison with the profiles of miniature hydriai from the sanctuary,86 it should be Middle Hellenistic in date, indicating the survival of the type. The only hydriaphoros with a useful chronological context is H51, which was found with pottery terminating in the early 3rd century B.C. H50 can be connected in fabric and workmanship to a head wearing a rough version of the Hellenistic melon coiffure (H223) and a figurine of a standing girl (H44); they may have been made in the same workshop (Workshop J, see p. 346). The pottery context of H44 falls into the latter half of the 3rd century B.C.; the hydriaphoros H50 should date to this time as well, as a product of the same workshop. This group clearly is not unified typologically or stylistically. Apart from H49, which is the most traditional in form and has mold siblings, the figurines seem to have been improvised from other types. The decline in the use of this figurine type already can be seen in the Classical period and probably is to be attributed to the growing popularity of miniature hydriae.87 STANDING DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES: ARCHAIZING (H52-H54) At least one workshop developed an archaizing type, H52-H54, which resembles some of the figurines of votaries in its slender proportions. The hieratic pose and drapery, however, as well as the retrospective style and the headdress, point to a representation of a goddess. The pose is rigidly frontal, legs together; below the waist is an archaizing arrangement of stiff central pleats and half a swallowtail pattern at the right side; at the left, the swallowtail pattern is eliminated, as if the hand, which lies flat at the side, were drawing the overfold away from the thigh. A flower(?) is held at the chest in the right hand. A polos is worn over long hair streaming over the shoulders, as in a group of Aphrodite and Eros (P1. 78) of Corinthian provenience 86 Corinth XVIII, i, p. 11, fig. 1, pl. 50. 87 Corinth XVIII, i, p. 104.</page><page sequence="154">130 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS in Athens.88 The type is well represented in a 3rd-century B.C. deposit found in the South Stoa, where it is associated with hero cult.89 A fragmentary example from the Demeter sanctuary was found in Pit B (lot 880, see catalogue sub H52), the pottery of which terminates in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C. Given its similarity in proportions to the Early Hellenistic votaries, it is likely that the archetype was created in the later 4th century B.C. The best-preserved face (H54), with its strong jaw and earthy features, suggests that the head may be a later generation of the head type of the votaries H19 and H20, with the hair reworked and a polos added. The popularity of the type, its archaism, the polos, and the offering held to the chest, all suggest that it was a replacement for the lingering Archaic standing "kore" type (p. 23, note 1), itself an archaizing creation of the 5th century B.C., which was probably still in use well into the 4th century. Since no examples of the archaizing type were found in the Potters' Quarter, the occasion for its invention may have been the demise, in or near the 320s B.C., of the workshops where the "korai" were made. Perhaps a demand for traditional figurines with the Archaic flavor of the "korai" led to the creation of a type incorporating an older style within a newer one. The immediate inspiration for the dress may have come from stone hekataia, but the archaizing features of the drapery are incorporated into a type close to the Corinthian Early Hellenistic votaries.90 The goddess represented could be either Kore or Aphrodite. Kore is perhaps to be preferred, if the type took the place of the earlier standing "korai," which probably represented that goddess. ISOLATED HEAD RELATED TO VOTARIES (H55) The isolated head H55 differs in facial type and quality of workmanship from the votaries and is larger in scale, but it is linked to them by its long, streaming locks of hair, fillet, and ogival forehead. Its poor retouch and distorted features may indicate that it is a late attempt, by an artisan of limited skill, to recapture the type and style of a votary figurine. Further, the addition of an earring is untrue to the usually unadorned votary type. STANDING DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES: MANTLED (H56-H138) In this section are discussed Early Hellenistic female figurines wearing the chiton or peplos covered by a mantle in various arrangements or wearing the mantle only. A few of the faces are youthful, but the group as a whole consists of fully mature women or goddesses. In the absence of attributes or distinctive headdresses, it is not always easy to distinguish between mortals and deities. In some cases, a particular drapery arrangement known in sculpture will help to identify a goddess. Some figurines of women enveloped in mantles, recalling "Tanagra" figurines in a general way, find their best iconographic parallels among the bystanders in votive reliefs and therefore probably represent mortals. They do not carry specific offerings and perhaps are to be understood as sanctuary visitors in a general sense, not necessarily as the principal participants in rituals, such as the young brides discussed above. In this connection, it is worth recalling the tendency of Hellenistic figurines toward an increasing secularization of type.91 Whether or not this shift in types signals a changing attitude toward religion is debatable, since more specifically votive types 88 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160; Papa- spyridi-Karouzou 1956, pp. 174-177, figs. 7-10, pl. 6; Latti- more 1987, p. 419, fig. 5, with bibliography. 89 Davidson 1942, pp. 114-115, fig. 5; Broneer 1942, p. 129. The type was offered at the Thesmophorion in Pella: Lilibaki- Akamati 1996, pp. 51-53, pl. 17. 90 For archaistic sculpture of generally similar type, see Fullerton 1987, pp. 261-263 on peplophoroi (these are Late Hellenistic, however, and represent Artemis-Hekate); Agora XI, pp. 86-107, on hekataia.

Perhaps it signifies only an increasing attendance at festivals as a by-product of prosperity, a less specifically religious image being considered a suitable offering by those without a specific ritual to perform, vow to make, or favor to ask but wishing nevertheless to demonstrate reverence for the deity. If one traces the gradual transition of types from the Classical to the Early Hellenistic period, it becomes apparent that there was continuity, either because types were carried into the Hellenistic period as survivals or because new types that conveyed similar meanings replaced them. For example, the articulated "dolls" continued to some extent as survivals, as shown by the pierced head with a melon coiffure (C136) but the Classical female votaries were replaced by the Early Hellenistic female piglet carriers, and the seated goddesses were replaced by a much more varied repertoire of standing deities. The mantled women, however, did not replace anything but augmented the existing array of votive types. Therefore, one can speak of secularization of types in the Demeter sanctuary only in the sense of supplementing, not replacing, the votive repertoire. In addition, there is a loss of hieratic style in some types in favor of styles more closely connected with the larger world of the arts. It is perhaps not coincidental that masculine types appear to have declined both in quality and in quantity in proportion to the increasing number of female types. The abundant Archaic handmade horse-riders (see p. 60) that survived into f the 4th century B.C. were replaced after the destruction of the Potters' Quarter in the 320s B.C. by moldmade plaques, only one example of which was found in the Demeter sanctuary (V19). Similarly, the Classical mae banqueter type produced at the Potters' Quarter (see pp. 65-68) was replaced by a new type including a seated female figure, which is identified at the Demeter sanctuary only with some uncertainty (see p. 67). On the basis of this evidence, and if one may assume that the draped feminine types usually were dedicated by women, it may be worth speculating that by Early Hellenistic times the practice of hero cult in the sanctuary suggested by the horse-riders and banqueters had declined; the growing proportion of female figurine types mightensi then signify the increasing participation of women in the rituals. Before beginning the discussion of the Early Hellenistic draped female types, the question of identifying the headdresses worn by some of these figurines should be addressed. The difficulty in identification stems from the conflation of two types of headdress, the polos and the stephane, in some figurines. In sculpture, for example, in Archaic Attic korai, the two types of headdress are easily distinguishable from one another. The polos of the Lyons kore,92 for example, is a low, slightly flaring cylinder, flat on top and set on top of the cranium. The stephane worn by the kore Akropolis Museum 674,93 on the other hand, is a very low crown that partly encircles the head, leaving the cranium, where the locks of hair are clearly rendered, bare. If one looks at evidence apart from sculpture, terracotta votive poloi, presumably models of real headdresses, are rather different from the sculptured poloi, being tall, open cylinders topped with decorative borders.94 The stephane, by definition, is nothing more than an encircling headdress,95 yet it would be wise to narrow this definition somewhat, or the term loses utility by encompassing the many forms of crowns and wreaths found in Greek art. Dorothy Thompson proposed to define the stephane as "a crescent-shaped diadem," usually plain but with variations.96 This working definition has been adopted for the present study. Among the Corinthian terracotta figurines, Archaic female types may wear a high, hollow polos97 or a lower one, formed by an applied strip of clay.98 On 5th-century B.C. heads, the 92 Richter 1968, pp. 57-58, no. 89, figs. 275-279. 93 Richter 1968, pp. 81-82, no. 127, figs. 411-416. 94 Simon 1972, pp. 206-207, figs. 1-4; British Museum I, p. 209, no. 781, pl. 103.

When the head is solid and the headdress was included in the mold, the polos may also be solid (e.g., C73). Thus, the form of the polos depends, in part, upon whether it was a hand-applied strip (and was consequently hollow) or a moldmade, solid cylinder. The coroplastic technique influenced the form, and the applied-strip polos was easily conflated with an encircling stephane. Such confusion sometimes occurs among Early Hellenistic figurines. This confusion is exacerbated by the fact that the backs of moldmade heads, even those of good quality, were often handmade and carelessly finished, with the expectation that the viewer would perceive the headdress and other accessories from the more detailed front. Even when the back was moldmade as well, the headdress was not always finished, as in the half-polos of the "priestess" H395. Consequently, the headdresses in this chapter have been identified mainly by their appearance from the front. If the form diminishes at the sides into a rounded or pointed crescent shape, the headdress is called a stephane; if it remains high at the sides, it is assumed that the coroplast had in mind a polos. Sometimes, however, even this simple distinction is hard to draw. While it is important to the scholar to recognize these headdresses, particularly the polos, which denoted divinity and was worn by brides, the coroplast may not always have concerned himself with such distinctions. For example, the female head H192 clearly wears a pointed stephane, yet in H193, a head of closely related type that was probably made in the same workshop, the headdress is higher at the sides and approaches a polos in appearance. In this case, since the better-made piece clearly shows a stephane, the coroplast may have intended to represent the same headdress in the lesser work. In the case of H54, the headdress is clearly a polos in front, although it is abbreviated at the back. On the typologically similar but smaller head of H53, however, the headdress approaches a stephane in shape. Since the larger head of this type wears a polos, it is assumed that the coroplasts of the smaller head intended to represent a polos as well, and it is therefore so identified. The only firm statement that can be made about the polos in 4th-century B.C. and Early Hellenistic figurines is that it is low in shape.99 FIGURINES IN PEPLOS AND MANTLE (THE GRIMANI TYPE) (H56-H62) Two groups of Classical and Early Hellenistic stone statuettes, most of which represent Demeter and Kore, find parallels among Corinthian figurines. They are the so-called Grimani statuettes, of Cretan origin,100 already mentioned in connection with Classical peplos-figurines (see p. 35), and a group from the Sanctuary of Demeter at Kyparissi on Kos.101 The Corinthian figurines connected with them are the large (size range 4) H56-H60 and the fragmentary variants H61 and H62. In this type, a small mantle is draped over a peplos, covering only the shoulders and chest. Apart from one of the Grimani statuettes, a generally similar drapery scheme of peplos and small mantle draped across the chest is found in the figure of Demeter on a votive relief from Eleusis, although without the characteristic folds around the breasts,102 and in a late-4th-century statue from Samos.103 H56 preserves the torso in full length, while H57 supplies the left side missing from H56. The two are from different mold series, and still a third series is represented by the fragment H59. H58 probably represents an earlier generation; thin-walled and hard fired, it is evidence of a very large, fine rendition of this type. H60 may be an earlier generation as well but is obscured by added drapery. 99 For a good example, see the Corinthian Aphrodite and Eros in Athens, National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160 (P1. 78; see p. 130, note 88). 100 Kabus-Jahn 1972; Ridgway 1981a, pp. 194-198, with bibliography on p. 219; Strocka 1979, pp. 171-172. 101 Kabus-Preisshofen 1975. 102 Peschlow-Bindokat 1972, p. 152, no.

The characteristic motif is the stretching and pleating of the cloth so that both breasts are framed and accented by curving folds. A similar motif, but with the mantle wrapped like a sheath around the slim figure down to the knees or the hem of a thin chiton, is characteristic of a much repeated sculptural Kore type, sometimes shown in reliefs next to a more matronly, voluminously draped Demeter;104 it is also seen on the Muse with the aulos on the Mantineia base.105 It may also be present in the fragmentary H80. The head preserved in H57 shows a youthful face with the rather oblong shape and full jaw typical of Corinthian heads. The face is framed by a row of corkscrew curls, topped by a low polos that is not fully rounded in back, like the poloi of Middle Hellenistic "priestesses" (e.g., H395). The isolated head H179 also has a youthful face and clusters of corkscrew curls, topped by a flaring, fully rounded polos; it is not known whether H179 originally belonged to a torso of the same type as H57. The polos suggests that the figurines represent a goddess. If so, the goddess is more likely to be Kore than Demeter, tojudge from oflss the outhfulness of the face and the corkscrew curls, which may suggest a bridal coiffure.106 Curls of this kind are known on terracotta figures of girls from Lavinium, in the context of the Sanctuary of Athena Ilias/Minerva, whose cult was active from the 6th to the 3rd century B.C.; there the curls are connected with the traditional Roman bridal coiffure described in literary sources.107 An isolated head from the Demeter sanctuary at Knossos also has corkscrew curls,108 as does its parallel, a standing female figurine in chiton and mantle, of reported Cretan prove- nience, in London;109 neither head wears a polos. It should be noted that corkscrew curls also appear at the Acrocorinth sanctuary on a Hellenistic head type wearing a stephane (H193), on a Late Archaic figurine (MF-12162110), which has red paint on the face and therefore is probably male, and on an early-5th-century B.C. male terracotta sculptured head.lll In at least one female Archaic head (MF-12034112), the long locks of hair on the shoulders are twisted into corkscrew curls, as they are on the Early Classical hydriaphoros C53 (see p. 40). Outside Corinth, corkscrew curls appear on both male and female types in widely differing contexts; to give just a few examples, they appear on female figures connected with the cult of Isis,113 on Apollo types from Cyprus,ll4 on the bronze "Gabinius" from Herculaneum,115 and on a statue in Boston identified as Demeter.116 Unfortunately, the available evidence is not clear enough to explain precisely what, if anything, the wearing of corkscrew curls signified in Corinth. The head type of H57 may not have been the only one used with this torso type. The head is rather small in proportion to the torso, and the youthful face is somewhat incongruous with the matronly body, suggesting that the original design called for a larger and more mature head type. The fragmentary H59 has long, streaming locks of hair on the left shoulder, and a probable mold sibling of H57 (see catalogue) shows two long, twisted locks of hair on the right shoulder, indicating that heads with different coiffures, at least, were used with this torso type. Long hair would have been suitable for figurines of either Demeter or Kore. It would appear that, as among 104 Palagia 1980, pp. 28-30, figs. 48-50, with bibliography; Kabus-Preisshofen 1975, pp. 50-52, pls. 22-24. 105 Todisco 1993, pl. 289. 106 On the polos in representations of Persephone, see Mor- gantina, pp. 81-82. 107 Torelli 1984, pp. 31-50, esp. pp. 36-41; the interpreta- tion of this coiffure as bridal is not accepted by all (see La Fol- lette 1994, pp. 56-57, esp. note 27 on pp. 62-63).

The comparable Grimani statuette, one of the better-made pieces in its group, is the well- known goddess in a low, lightly crenellated polos, over which the mantle is draped as a veil; she is usually identified as Demeter or Hera. 117 She wears blunt-toed shoes with soles, rather than the soft, narrow, flat-soled slippers of H56, her right arm was outstretched, presumably to hold a scepter, the peplos overfold is shorter, and the mantle is drawn over the head as a veil, but the distinctive drapery arrangement over the chest corresponds very closely. In addition, the statuette and the figurine H56 share an error inherent in the design, the representation of a pouched fold under the right arm, which is incongruous with the folds rendered down the side; these folds indicate that the peplos should be open at the right side. The face of the Grimani statuette is not exactly paralleled by any of the Corinthian figurines, but the oblong shape, full jaw, and strong features with the nose close to the upper lip have a distinctly Peloponnesian flavor. The essentially rectangular outline of the Grimani statuette and the figurines suggests that the original design should be dated not later than the first half of the 4th century B.C. The very deeply set eyes of the Grimani statuette and the crease marks on the wide central pleat of the overfold, however, put it somewhat later, perhaps in the third quarter of the 4th century B.C. The Corinthian figurines must have been made in the Early Hellenistic period, to judge from the narrow slippers of H56 and the tooling on the hair of H57. The rows of parallel, diagonal slashes on the locks of hair are found on the melon coiffures of Early Hellenistic heads, such as H224. Presumably, both the shoes and the head were later alterations to a type of earlier design, of which only the torso remains. Of this group, only H56 was found in a chronologically useful context, with pottery terminating in the early 3rd century B.C. The Grimani statuettes, although connected with one another through provenience and technique, actually contain material of diverse type and style. This diversity has been explained by deriving the statuettes from different cult statues, made over a period of more than a half- century in the same Cretan workshop, and representing Demeter and Kore; the statuettes are thought to have been dedicated in the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos. If this interpretation is correct, it might support the identification as goddesses of figurines resembling the Grimani statuettes. Ridgway, however, has suggested more sensibly that the workshop drew upon a fund of types generally available to artisans.118 Certainly some coroplastic workshops made a point of copying well-known statues, as at Myrina and Smyrna (see p. 297), but a blanket derivation of smaller plastic art from particular "important" statues seems to be a distortion of artistic practice as we understand it. Portraying deities in a great variety of ways was fundamental to the imaginative processes of Greek art in general, and there is no evidence that the process had to be linked to the making of images for display and worship in temples. Certainly, the viewing of other artisans' finished works was not the only opportunity for copying. Once designs were created, in the form of either models or drawings, whether specifically commissioned or made for sale to other artisans for different purposes, they would have been available for copying in different media, distributed either in the same place or elsewhere. Some of these designs could have been intended for cult statues but were not necessarily so (see pp. 35-36). When a model maker or sculptor decided how to pose, dress, and coif a statue of a deity, he must have drawn upon general conceptions of the deity's function and appearance, which were common to Greek artisans in all media, since they derived from a shared religion.119 Votive reliefs, 117 Kabus-Jahn 1972, pp. 51-59, pls. 28-35. 118 Ridgway 1981 a, p. 195: "... certain major types proba- bly occurred in more than one version, in more than one place, made by more than one master, and perhaps representing more than one deity." 119 Alroth (1989, pp. 106-108) concludes that there is no real pattern distinguishable of figurines following cult statues; in some cases, the influence of the cult image is apparent, while in others it clearly is not, and still others are too generic in type and style for certainty. On the whole question of the ancient concept of "cult" statues, see Donohue 1997.</page><page sequence="159">DISCUSSION 135 stone statuettes, and figurines may be said to share such conceptions, through the use of similar models in the workshops of stone carvers and coroplasts. In this view, the intervention of a major statue is not necessary, the smaller plastic arts do not have to derive from the larger, and insofar as the model making or drawing took place at a smaller scale, the position is, in fact, reversed; the availability and exchange of workshop materials become primary factors. The point of this digression is to say that the most likely explanation of the similarity between the Grimani statuette and the figurines is that both derived from the same source, although the statuette was made in Crete and the figurines in Corinth. This prototypical design could have been intended originally as a model for a representation of Demeter, since the goddess also appears in relief sculpture wearing a peplos covered by a small mantle over the upper torso;120 the model, however, was not necessarily for a cult statue. The intention could have been merely to create a design suitable for votives in different media, and votives need not copy cult images, as is obvious in the vast range of types dedicated at the Demeter sanctuary in Corinth. OTHER FIGURINE TYPES IN PEPLOS AND MANTLE (H63, H64) H63 is a small fragment of another type that may have shown a mantle worn over a peplos, to judge from the wide folds of the skirt, which probably represent heavy cloth. The overlapping open edges of the mantle, which presumably hang from the left shoulder, have been rendered with careful detail. The edge of the mantle front is folded back on itself, while the edge of the mantle back lies over it and in turn is folded back in the opposite direction. The mantle hem undulates in response to the wide skirt folds beneath, which are more like those of a peplos than the thin cloth of a chiton. This large, well-made piece originally must have been very handsome and sculptural in effect. An entirely different combination of peplos and mantle is found in H64, the fairly complex draping of which is described in the catalogue. The closely wrapped breast corresponds with a well-known Kore type,l21 although the mantle arrangement is otherwise different. The originally outstretched right arm suggests that the figurine perhaps held a scepter or torch and could have represented the goddess. FIGURINES IN MANTLE ONLY (H65-H79) During the 4th century B.C., a number of variants were developed in Corinth of a drapery scheme featuring a heavy, curtainlike fall of mantle folds from the left shoulder to the feet, covering the bent arm and hand, which was placed on the hip. This opaque, enveloping mass of cloth contrasts with the smooth stretching of the mantle over the torso to reveal its contours, recalling the broad, simple, but rather bold effects favored by Corinthian coroplasts in earlier periods. The best-preserved example is H65, in which the neck and right shoulder are painted pink, without traces of chiton folds, indicating bare flesh and a costume consisting only of a mantle. Mantle- only drapery arrangements similarly baring the right shoulder are found in 4th-century B.C. Attic red-figure vase painting, for example, in a pelike by the Marsyas Painter, dated to the early third quarter of the 4th century B.C.122 The painting shows Peleus surprising Thetis at her bath and a seated figure, draped only in a mantle and calmly observing the scene; because Eros is beside her, this figure must be Aphrodite. On the basis of this identification and the presence in the Acrocorinth sanctuary of nude figurines that certainly portray Aphrodite (see pp. 172-174), 120 See p. 132, note 102. 121 See p. 133, note 104. 122 Arias and Hirmer 1962, p. 384, color pl. XLVII. In another vase painting, the mantle reveals the breast as well as the shoulder, LIMC II, 1984, p. 33, no. 214, pl. 24, s.v. Aphrodite (A. Delivorrias et al.); Eros appears here as well to confirm the identification.</page><page sequence="160">136 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS the Corinthian figurines so draped also may represent her. A mantled bronze statuette in the Fogg Art Museum, identified as Aphrodite, bares the right breast as well as the shoulder and holds a dove.123 Also characteristic of H65 are stocky proportions and small but prominent breasts; the right breast is slightly lower than the left even though the right arm is raised. Similar proportions are found in small-scale representations, in various media, of the nude Aphrodite with a mirror in her left hand, lifting her right hand to arrange her hair.124 The archetype of H65 may have been developed from such a nude figure, adding the heavy drapery fall at the side, the skirt, and a few ridges across the torso to indicate folds of cloth. This procedure would account for the inconsistency between cloth that seems very heavy in the drapery fall but nearly transparent over the torso. While coroplastic technique may account in this instance for the drapery style, Late Classical sculpture, in fact, shows a similar contrast between transparency and weight, as in the Epidauros akroteria. 25 Since the head of H65 originally must have been turned to the right, to judge from the tilt of the neck, and the right arm was raised, it is possible that the right hand arranged the hair, as in the nude figures mentioned above. It also may be mentioned in this connection that a bronze Aphrodite pudica statuette in Boston, of reported Corinthian provenience, has similar proportions.126 The closely and smoothly draped figure with heavy thighs may have been a particular favorite in Corinth in the Early Hellenistic period, since it appears also on a bronze mirror found in a mid-3rd-century B.C. Corinthian tomb; the mirror is thought to be earlier than the tomb, perhaps belonging to the first or early second quarter of the 3rd century B.C.127 H65 is made of a hard, fine fabric; the surface was smoothed with a finely toothed instrument, which has left its marks particularly on the thighs. Both fabric and tool marks are very similar to those of a fine Nike figurine (MF-7 1-42, P. 76) from the Forum Southwest excavations. 128 It may be significant that the Nike is even more obviously constructed from a nude torso, to which folds have been added at the sides. The workshop practice noted above (p. 58), in which nude "dolls"' torsos were transformed into dancers through the application of folds, seems to be continued here, but more shapely and feminine torsos were used as the foundation. The Nike is from a deposit dating to the third quarter of the 4th century B.C.129 H65 was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which contained pottery dating from the 6th to the beginning of the 3rd centuries B.C. It seems fair to say that Corinthian archetype makers were working with this Aphrodite type in the middle to third quarter of the 4th century B.C. and that it continued in use into the 3rd century B.C. Two larger figurines (size range 4) of similar type are preserved in the fragments H66 and H67, the latter from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Their original composition can be understood best through the better-preserved MF-3396 in the Corinth collection, a probable mold sibling of H66.130 As in H65, the mantle, with no garment beneath, is stretched from the right armpit to the left shoulder, and the close wrapping of the torso contrasts with the heavy fall of drapery at the left side; the right upper arm originally was extended to the side, and the right breast is slightly lower than the left. The fold pattern is different, however, in the arrangement of folds to frame the breasts, as in H56 and H57, and the drapery fall is divided by a horizontal overfold, presumably of surplus 123 Hanfmann 1962, pls. 73, 74; reportedly from Epidauros. 124 Cf. variants in LIMC II, 1984, pp. 60-61, nos. 490-496, pl. 48, s.v.

It is not a very felicitous pattern and looks very awkward in a complete example in Paris.132 This figurine, said to have been found in Tanagra but made of Corinthian fabric, wears an unusual, long-sleeved garment beneath the mantle; it is presumably a later variant of the type, since it is only a little more than half the size of H66, has a more rigid fold pattern, and has lost the contrast between the torso and drapery fall. The head, similar in type to H242, is wrapped in a sakkos. A tantalizing fragment of beautiful fabric (H68) is evidence of yet another possible variant, in which the zigzag folds marking the open edges of the mantle form a diamond pattern, and the slack cloth down the bent left leg drops into a cuff at the ankle. In another small, but very well made and quite lovely variant (H69), the overfold of surplus cloth is carried more gracefully over the bent left arm. This figurine is an instructive example of Corinthian style, when it is compared with the corresponding "Tanagra" version, the so-called Sophocles type.133 In both versions, the focus of the composition is the same, and the enveloping mantle is visually anchored by the curtain of folds at the left side, divided horizontally at thigh level. While the "Tanagra" composition is developed over the surface through tension folds stretched between anatomical points, however, in the Corinthian rendering, geometric forms and volumes prevail over surface line. Another contrast with the "Tanagra" figurines is technical. The Corinthian figurines in this group, for all the care lavished on finishing the fronts, have handmade backs, flattened and summarily treated, while the "Tanagras" normally have fully molded and fairly detailed backs. The proportions of H69 are not stocky, and it is altogether a better-formed figurine than H65. Its drapery pattern includes a looped fold around one breast, a mannerism previously noted in the peplos-figurine C36. The head is relatively small in proportion to the torso. The facial type, long and straight-sided, with large, earthy features, is entirely Corinthian, recalling the much larger Early Classical youth's head C208, although there are no certain mechanical relatives among other Corinthian heads. The coiffure, braided back from the center of the forehead, is usually associated with young women and children and is known in other head types, such as C164. Although H69 is from a mixed pottery context, its proportions, drapery scheme, and good fabric should date it no later than the second half of the 4th century B.C. H70 is a simplified version that has lost much of the weight of the mantle fall, although the close wrapping of the mantle and the distinctive folds above and below the breasts have been retained. It has gained a knot of drapery in the crook of the arm, which is more clearly outlined beneath the mantle, as well as an attached plaque base. It has more attenuated proportions than those of the preceding figurines, and a strongly outthrust left hip. It was made in the same workshop (Workshop I, p. 346), and possibly by the same hand, as the standing female type in chiton and mantle H100 and H101 as well as four other figurines (see catalogue). All share the same shallow, summary modeling, thick walls, and sloppy interior; almost all the members of this workshop group were found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the pottery of which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. H65 is from the same archaeological context; it shows a drapery arrangement similar to that of H70, although it is very different in proportions and far better in technique. On these grounds, the workshop group probably should be placed at or near the end of its chronological context, at the end of the 4th or beginning of the 3rd century B.C. 131 It is difficult to envision the arrangement of cloth that would produce an overfold only on the drapery fall. The motif may have originated in the capelike overfold of the upper edge of the mantle that stretched across the torso as well as the arm; it appears in sculpture, in the late-4th-century B.C. Dionysos "Sardanapalos" type: LIMC III, 1986, p. 545, no. 37, pl. 430, s.v. Dionysos/Bacchus (C. Gasparri); Ridgway 1990, p. 91, with bibliography on pp. 105-106, note 39. 132 Louvre III, p. 14, no.

It was found in a pottery context terminating in the second half of the 5th century B.C., although it is unlikely to be earlier than the 4th century B.C. in date. Female figures closely wrapped in mantles do begin to appear in Attic votive reliefs in the late 5th century B.C.,134 but I would hesitate to place the origins of H70 within the 5th century B.C. on the basis of a single fragment that is neither from a closed deposit nor of a type found elsewhere on the site in such an early context. H72 is between H70 and H71 in scale; it is of similar type and shows a looped fold pattern over the abdomen like that of H71 but is not a clear mechanical relative. This example shows long locks of hair on the shoulder. In two figurines (H73 and H74), the former also from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the left arm is not akimbo, but the upper arm is pressed against the side, securing the mantle in place, and the forearm originally was extended forward across the chest; neither piece preserves the right side, but the direction of the folds diagonally upward from the left elbow suggests that the right shoulder may have been covered by the mantle rather than revealed. Both have a knot of drapery in the crook of the arm, as in H70; H73 preserves a stiff zigzag drapery cascade and a cuffed ankle fold, as in H68. The drapery motif in which a long cascade hangs from a knot can be found also in a 4th-century B.C. sculptured relief of Aphrodite and Eros, found near Perachora and thought to be Corinthian.135 In this piece, the knot nestles in the crook of Aphrodite's arm and can be understood as the bunched cloth at the top of the cascade, which is held in place by the forearm. Mantle folds curving down over the left upper arm appear also in H75 and H76. The former probably has nude shoulders, although a slight ridging on the left shoulder could indicate folds; the mantle originally was wrapped under the right arm, as in H65. The right upper torso of H76 is missing, but from the direction of the folds over the abdomen, the mantle may have been gathered up at the hip in the right hand. In this case, it is likely that the mantle was thrown across both shoulders. This figurine is rather crudely made but echoes H65 in its stocky proportions and is from the same pottery lot. It is rather reminiscent of the voluminous, heavily mantled figures in red-figure vase paintings of Kerch style, which are often sculpturally based.136 In two pieces (H77 and H78), the mantle covers both arms but reveals the right shoulder. Two figurines from a grave at Delphi, dated to the end of the 4th century B.C., preserve a similar type; they are mantled nearly to the ankles, the right hand gathering up the cloth at the thigh, with a chiton beneath.137 A similar mantle arrangement also is found in sculpture, in a Muse from the Altar of Athena at Priene, dated to the later 3rd century B.C.138 H78 shows a pattern of tautly stretched flat folds over clearly contoured breasts, which is reminiscent in style of the mantled figurine H99. A similar arrangement of the upper mantle edge into horizontal folds across the shoulders is found in MF-8662 in the Corinth collection.139 In this figurine, chiton folds show at the hem, and the pose is that of a dancer. At least some of these figurines must represent Aphrodite, since nudity beneath a mantle should probably be understood as suggestive of sexual accessibility. The identification seemed reasonable for H65 and by extension for H66. H69, however, has a braided coiffure usually seen on figurines of children and young women. Attempts to identify goddesses can be very subjective, and certainly the fragments are difficult to pin down. Goddesses were often represented without 134 E.g., on the reverse of the Echelos and Basile relief: Boardman 1985, p. 186, fig. 168:b, nymph at the far right. 135 Hornbostel 1988, pl. 49; attribution on pp. 178-179. 136 E.g., Arias and Hirmer 1962, p. 384, pls. 225-228, a nup- tial lebes by the Marsyas Painter; on these vases, see Schefold 1934. 137 Walter 1942, cols. 133-134, fig. 6 in cols. 111, 112. 138 J.

The presence of Eros is the best assurance that a figurine represents Aphrodite, as in a group of Corinthian provenience in Athens (P1. 78).140 A much smaller rendering (H79) could have derived from a type similar to those discussed here. A few folds at the upper break probably belong to a chiton worn under the mantle, but the folding down of the upper edge of the mantle to form a doubled cape over the left shoulder recalls the design solutions of this group. This figurine, which leans on an ithyphallic herm, could well represent Aphrodite (see p. 276 on herm supports). FIGURINES IN CHITON AND MANTLE; THE "POETESS" TYPE (H80-H98) Figurines wearing the mantle over a chiton are the most numerous of the draped types, but unlike the two groups discussed above, they are extremely varied in type. Only one group with a typological development, H88-H97 (the "poetess" type) is discernible among them. H80 is only a fragment of the right shoulder, breast, and upper arm of a female figurine, but it is very telling nevertheless. The mantle is wrapped tightly under the arm and across the breast, over a chiton, in a fashion characteristic of Kore in 4th-century B.C. votive and document reliefs and sculpture. 141 Since the upper arm is outstretched to the side, as if to hold a scepter or torch, it is likely that this figurine does indeed represent Kore. Although common in sculpture, including a votive relief from Corinth,142 the type is relatively rare among the figurines from the Demeter sanctuary and presumably was not produced in any quantity in Corinthian workshops. H81 may be a much more complicated variant of this type, with the chiton dropping from the right shoulder, and the mantle folded into a capelet over the left shoulder, echoing a motif found in a 3rd-century B.C. stone statuette of Kore from Kos.143 In the Kos statuette, however, the chiton covers the right shoulder, and the mantle folds that stretch diagonally from the left shoulder are caught under the bent right elbow; this motif probably was not carried through in H81. Further, the drapery patterns of H81 are broken into triangular groups of stretched folds. One group of folds radiates from the left hip across the abdomen to the missing right hip, which was probably outthrust, and another group radiates over the left forearm and hand from inside the elbow. For a Corinthian coroplast, this is an unusually complex arrangement, since the general preference was for broader, simpler effects and less detail. The grouping of tension folds into triangular patterns is more in the tradition of "Tanagra" figurines, and yet this figurine does not follow a known "Tanagra" type. H81 is perhaps something of a hybrid, the result of imposing "Tanagraean" features on an otherwise local type. The fragment H82 may be from a figurine of similar type but with the right shoulder covered. In the much less well made H83, the coroplast may have been trying to imitate the capelike overfold on the left shoulder, but the more interesting wrapping and pulling of folds is lacking. H83 also somewhat resembles the larger and better-made H84 in the looped folds over the abdomen. H85 is a large and well-made piece that finds its best parallel for pose and drapery arrange- ment in East Greek male sculptural types. In this figurine type, a mantle is draped over a thin chiton, covering the left shoulder and extended forearm; it is rolled around the waist and covers the skirt. There is a triangular overfold in front, not in the more common pointed form but with a curved edge from the right hip to the left thigh; the surface is broken by arrowhead folds. The matronly figure is broad shouldered, with a rather short waist and low, full breasts; the head is 140 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160; see p. 130, note 88. 141 M.

There is a faint torsion in the pose, the chest turning slightly to the right while the left leg is frontal. The stance is unexpected, because the weight is carried on the right leg; a 5th-century B.C. sculptor of a figure with an overfold draped toward the left side would have balanced it by bending the right knee.144 The pose, with its sense of unease and slight torsion, is well paralleled by the mid-4th-century B.C. "Maussollos" from Halikarnassos145 and less well preserved statues from Rhodes and Kos, believed to depend upon a cult statue of Asklepios of the second half of the 4th century B.C.146 The drapery style of the "Maussollos" is more impressionistic, but deeply pocketed folds down the straight right leg, seeming to originate from the center of the waist beneath the overfold, and a looped fold from the bent left knee, falling into a cuff around the right ankle, are found in both the figurine and the statue. Interesting parallels again can be found in Kerch-style vase paintings, particularly in the work of the Marsyas Painter, which is dated to the middle to third quarter of the 4th century B.C. The sculptural quality of his figures has been recognized, and his use of unusual, off-balance poses, and small heads together with massive upper torsos, compares well with our figurine.147 There is also some resemblance between H85 and the Demeter of Knidos in the facial type and in the matronly, short-waisted proportions coupled with a relatively small head; a more specific parallel can be found in the coiffure, which shows long locks of hair streaming to the shoulders from beneath waving, horizontal locks of hair wrapped from the temples to the cranium.148 This coiffure is distinctly different from the long hair of the piglet-carrying votaries, which tumbles over the shoulders completely unbound. Moreover, the votaries usually hold offerings against the body, while the forearms and hands of H85 originally must have been extended. H85 may wear a very small stephane but no other headdress indicating divinity. In a votive relief in Paris, worshipers are lined up before a goddess, probably Demeter, who is similarly draped, and pours a libation with her lowered and extended right hand;149 H85 could perhaps be completed in this way. While it is certainly possible that this figurine represents a deity, perhaps Demeter sacrificing, it is also conceivable that the arrangement of the mantle, rolled and folded down into an apron in the front, signifies that the figure is a priestess rather than a sacrificing goddess.150 Other figurines from the Demeter sanctuary wearing mantles that are similarly rolled and folded into aprons (e.g., the Middle Hellenistic H401) may be priestesses (see p. 255). H85 was found with 4th-century B.C. and Early Hellenistic pottery. A chest fragment in very good fabric, probably from the same mold (see catalogue), was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Like other fine and large figurines from the sanctuary, H85 has few mechanical relatives. In addition to the probable mold sibling mentioned above, the head may be mechanically related to H182 (see p. 159). The only torso with any connection is the fragment H84, which is similar in the short-waisted proportions and the fold pattern over the abdomen; the mantle roll is carried up to the left shoulder, however. In two fragments of similarly large scale (H86 and H87), the mantle drops straight down the left side from the shoulder; H87 also has long hair. 144 E.g., as in the Velletri Athena: Ridgway 1981a, pp. 176- 177, with bibliography on p. 190, fig. 115. 145 Conveniently, Lullies and Hirmer 1960, pl. 211; Waywell 1978, pp. 97-103, no. 26, pl. 13; Ridgway 1997, pp. 126, 133, with bibliography on p. 150, notes 26 and 27, pl. 28. 146 Kabus-Preisshofen 1989, pp. 25-51, 228-232, nos. 46- 49, pls. 1-3. 147 See, e.g., his nuptial lebes in St. Petersburg: Arias and Hirmer 1962, p. 384, pls. 225-228. 148 Conveniently, Lullies and Hirmer 1960, pls. 224-225; Ridgway 1997, pp. 332-333, with bibliography on p. 356, note 21, pl. 79:a-c. 149 Hamiaux 1992, p. 216, no. 224; Hausmann 1960, p. 69, fig. 36 on p. 67; LIMC IV, 1988, p. 850, no. 27, pl. 564, s.v.

II-IV). Hellenistic grave reliefs of priestesses, however, do not show such a costume (Mantes 1990, pp. 97-103, pl. 45), nor does the statue of Hegeso from Priene, who was a priestess of Demeter (Priene, p. 150, fig. 120).</page><page sequence="165">DISCUSSION 141 The group of figurines H88-H97 is characterized by a complex drapery arrangement and a rather grand gesture of the right arm, which reaches across the chest to grasp the end of the mantle. The pose seems somewhat forced, at least in the context of figurines representing women, perhaps because the grasping of the mantle across the torso is characteristic of the probable portrait of the orator Hypereides.l51 A certain awkwardness in the too-large hands and stiff-legged, flat-footed pose of H88, the best-preserved figurine in the group, contributes to this masculine impression, although some members of the group are more graceful. Perhaps the supposed origin of sculptures with similar drapery arrangements in a poetess type helps to explain the gesture, which might have been suitable for a woman who had achieved public recognition through her literary efforts.152 The complicated, logically developed, and detailed drapery arrangement points to a prototype of good quality. The mantle is cleverly arranged to reveal the full length of the chiton skirt at the left side, where the palm of the left hand secures the folds of one mantle end against the hip. At the same time, the right hand reaches across the torso to grasp the other mantle end falling from the left shoulder. Additional features are a sling of cloth for the right arm, a panel of drapery falling behind the left arm, and a zigzag fold cascade down the front. The characteristic chiton of thin cloth with a double hem and very narrow folds indicates that the fragments H96 and H97, which preserve only the lower part, may belong to this type.153 The skirt drapery scheme, however, also appears with a mantle arrangement and arm position similar to the upper part of H70, in a Corinthian figurine in London.154 A related drapery scheme is found in the fragmentary H98, which shares the rather awkward, flat-footed stance with right leg forward and the double-hemmed chiton with narrow folds trailing over pointed slippers. 155 The mantle hem is draped higher, however, across the thighs and is gathered up at the hip. Perhaps all these types were developed at the same time, using the same archetype but reworking the drapery to produce variants. A similar drapery arrangement can be found occasionally among male figurines.156 It is possible that H95 in this group is a male figurine or a child; the chest is flat, but since the piece is derivative and not very well made, contours originally present in the figure could have been lost. The popularity of the type in Corinth is demonstrated by the enormous size range, from statuette scale in the fragments H89 and H90 down to the very small (size range 2) H93 and H94. The smallest versions have been simplified, eliminating the zigzag fold cascade in the front and covering the entire chiton skirt with the mantle. Apart from the articulated "dolls," this is the only Corinthian type to show such a range in size. Since there is not enough material to demonstrate mechanical continuity, it is unclear whether the figurines represent many generations of the same or parallel mold series, with details reworked as they lost clarity, or are derived from several archetypes of different sizes. A considerable range is apparent in fabric as well, H97 being the best; there is no correlation between figurine size and quality of fabric. This figurine type also was popular elsewhere157 and is found abundantly at West Greek sites.158 Its identification is uncertain; it could represent a goddess, although popularity in itself means little (certain types of "Tanagra" figurines also were repeated frequently and represent mortal women). None of the examples from the Demeter sanctuary preserves the head, but there are traces of long hair on the shoulder of H88. On the other hand, a figurine of this type in 151 Richter 1965, II, p. 211, fig. 1368. 152 Linfert-Reich 1971, pp. 68-70. 153 The double hem may show that two chitons were worn, a shorter one over one of normal length, perhaps to compensate for the transparency of the cloth. There is no attempt, however, to demonstrate transparency by superimposing folds, as in the case of Hellenistic sculptures wearing the delicate mantle thought to be the Koan vestis: Weber 1969/1970. 154 Higgins 1967, p. 104, pl. 47:c. 155 For this schema in sculptured relief, see Neumann 1979, p. 54, pl. 44:b. 156 Kharayeb, p. 63, nos.

D 160, with bibliography.</page><page sequence="166">142 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS Athens, which may be of Corinthian manufacture, has a coiffure with a cluster of curls at the top of the head similar to H201.159 An example from a tomb at Delphi wears a sakkos;l60 most other heads have some variation of the melon coiffure. The heads, therefore, do not offer any consistent clues to identity. The contexts in which these figurines are found may be more helpful. In Lavinium, a figurine of this type was found in a sanctuary of Athena Ilias/Minerva, who is thought to have been worshiped there not only as a goddess of war but also as a patroness of marriage and childbirth. 161 At Gravisca, the votive deposit in which this type was found included dedications to the Etruscan goddess Turan, who was equated with Venus.162 At Morgantina, the context is a sanctuary of Persephone.163 An example also was found in the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos.164 Taking these cultic contexts together with the Demeter sanctuary, there seems to be a repeated connection of the type with fertility cult, although not with the same goddess. In sculpture, this type was used to depict Aphrodite, who can be recognized through the presence of Eros.165 Its identification as Persephone has also been suggested, with reference to a stone statuette in Boston. 166 The date is easier to determine than the subject; the group must belong to the 4th century B.C., since H90 and H97 were found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., and H88 is from a 4th-century B.C. pottery context. A fragmentary mold from the Potters' Quarter, preserving the bottom of a draped female from the knees downward, has the characteristic stance with right leg forward, a double-hemmed chiton, and a similarly arranged mantle hem.167 If this mold was indeed fully of the type, it would date the type before the closing of the Potters' Quarter workshops in the 320s B.C. A fragmentary figurine of large scale from the Potters' Quarter also seems to be of this type.168 Whether similar figurines continued to be made in other workshops in Corinth into the 3rd century B.C. is uncertain. In other centers, however, similar types continued to be used into the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C.169 FIGURINES IN CHITON AND MANTLE: "TANAGRA" AND OTHER TYPES (H99-H138) Of the mantled figurines that follow, those that show compositional parallels with "Tanagra" figurines probably represent mortal women rather than goddesses. It is notable that the Demeter sanctuary is not very rich in such mantled figurines, in light of the abundance there of other types and the relative popularity of "Tanagras" elsewhere. Relatively few mantled figurines related to "Tanagra" types have been found in Corinth in excavations outside the Demeter sanctuary, although the plundered tombs that supplied collectors with Corinthian figurines during the 19th century yielded several fine examples. 170 Perhaps such figurines, which probably represented ordinary women in a genre rather than cultic context, were considered more suitable as gifts for women's graves, to represent the deceased as they were in life, than as sanctuary votives. H99 wears a lightweight mantle over a finely folded chiton. The mantle was wrapped closely around the neck and did not cover the missing head. Since there are no traces of locks of hair on the shoulders, the hair must have been bound with a cloth or arranged on top of the head. The gestures of pulling the edge of the mantle at the neck and lifting the hem are consonant with "Tanagra" iconography, but the style of the figurine is broader. There are tension folds across the 59 Winter, Typen II, p. 8, no. 4. 160 Konstantinou 1964, p. 218, pl. 259:y. 161Enea nelLazio, p. 189; further on this cult in Torelli 1984. 162 Comella 1978, p. 33, CI 23a-c, pl.

For a 2nd-century B.C. example, see Coroplast's Art, p. 163, no. 52 (in New York); this figurine carries a fan in the manner of "Tanagra" figurines and therefore probably represents a mortal. 170 E.g., Winter, Typen II, p. 7, nos. 5, 7; p. 108, no. 5.</page><page sequence="167">DISCUSSION 143 chest, as in some "Tanagras," but they are wide and flat, not narrow and sharp. The figurine is of relatively large scale, and the quality of the fabric is excellent, yet the back mold belongs to a different figurine type, in which the left hand was lowered at the side to grasp the edge of the mantle in a brief cascade of folds, as in H105. Apparently the workshop produced concurrently a variant type of identical scale, of which H105 could represent a later generation. A similar error occurred in the making of the votary with piglet HI (see p. 119). Either the concurrent manufacture of variants led to confusion or the correct back mold was broken or spoiled and could not be replaced; a copy made from an existing figurine would have been too small after shrinkage. This figurine belongs to a pottery context terminating in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C. H100 and H101 taken together make up the headless body of a mantled woman. Her right hand pulls the neckline folds of the mantle down into a triangular pattern from beneath the cloth, in a compositional motif known in sculpture in the so-called Aspasia/Sosandra type, which has been traced to an Early Classical original.171 Mantled figurines in similar poses were widely made172 and were perhaps popular for the sake of the interesting pattern of folds and for the opportunity to show the contour of the arm beneath the cloth. Although the polishing of the surface of H101 has dulled the detail considerably, it is apparent that the cloth of the chiton skirt is crinkly. This figurine type may have been popular in Corinth, since there may be evidence for three generations of H100 (see catalogue). The left forearm and clenched hand of H100 are upright from the elbow and tightly wrapped in the cloth, in a gesture documented also in mantled dancers.l73 This gesture may be the apotropaic "phallic hand," which has survived in Mediterranean lands into modern times to guard against evil; it is also found in the form of amulets.174 An Attic red-figured pelike in London shows the gesture much more graphically than in our figurines, in the mantled hand of a maenad, who dances while Dionysos sacrifices at an altar. 175 H101 is one of the few figurines from the Demeter sanctuary preserved with its base, in this case a rather clumsily formed high base with rounded front and flat back, and torus moldings at top and bottom, all set on another base in the form of a plaque. Both H100 and H101 were made in the same workshop (Workshop I, see p. 346) as the mantled figurine H70, which also stands on a plaque base but without another base intervening. Apparently this rather derivative workshop customarily mounted its figurines on plaque bases and did so even when the type being copied already had a base of its own, as did H101.176 Both H100 and H101 were found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The crinkly folds of the chiton skirt of this type, suggesting the texture of the cloth, are stylistically consonant with a date in the later 4th century B.C. and indicate that the figurine, although derivative, was not far in date from its prototype.177 A possible mechanical relative in Copenhagen (see catalogue) preserves the head, which shows a peaked coiffure and poorly defined facial features. H102 is probably a smaller version of this type; although the characteristic upraised left forearm is missing, the surface of the break is consistent with such a restoration. The pose of the right arm differs in that it creates a triangular pattern of tension folds by folding the arm in the mantle cloth as if in a sling. The characteristic diagonal tension fold from the left hip to the right leg was emphasized in H102 by tooling, but since the proportions have changed considerably towards narrower shoulders and greater slenderness, it is uncertain whether we are dealing with a considerably altered later generation or a figurine with no mechanical relationship. 171 Ridgway 1970, pp. 65-69, with bibliography on p. 75. 172 E.g., Winter, Typen II, p. 32, no. 7, of reported Corinthian provenience. 173 E.g., Winter, Typen II, p. 146, no. 8; probably also H156. 174 Elworthy 1895, pp. 149-155, 255-258; Wright 1866, pp. 65-72.

The head, too large in proportion to the torso, was not covered by the mantle. The coiffure has been reworked, but there are traces in back of a vertical plait that originally must have been pulled up from the forehead; the plait has been effaced in front, and a modified lampadion knot has been added at the top of the head. The plaited coiffure, generally associated with representations of children (see p. 57), is known in the Demeter sanctuary in C164 and C165, heads related to articulated "dolls." In its later manifestation, the braided coiffure has been reworked for a representation of a mature woman. The profile of the face of H102 recalls that of HI structurally, in its sloping forehead and receding chin, but otherwise the features are dissimilar. More similar features are found in the "doll's" head C156, which, however, is different in overall shape. H102 is from a pottery context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C., as are some of the mold siblings of its head (see catalogue). Figurines with the right arm wrapped in the mantle as if in a sling, the left hand on the outthrust hip, and the right leg bent or advanced are often called "Sophocleans" 178 because their composition is reminiscent of a sculptured portrait type of Sophocles.179 H103 and H104 are smaller variants of this type. In H103, the mantle covers the head and all the hair in front. In spite of the poor state of preservation, one can see that this figurine was originally well conceived and was not heavily reworked, although the fabric is coarser than usual. H104, in the same pose, is preserved with its plaque base, on which it was mounted to present the three-quarter view. It resembles H102 in its slender and narrow-shouldered proportions, and the folds of the chiton skirt are crinkly, as in H101, but the surface has been so heavily reworked that the original fold pattern is no longer discernible, and it is so heavy for its size that it may even be solid; it is clearly not the work of a very able craftsman. Its pottery context terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The left arm of H105 is at the side and only slightly bent to allow the hand to grasp the edge of the short and very thin mantle. The pyramidal, frontal composition is static, but the type originally may have been more interesting, emphasizing the transparency of the mantle in a way that is not evident in this dull impression. An earlier generation of this type could have been produced in the good workshop that made H99, as suggested above. H106 is a rather coarse rendering of a similar composition. A better-preserved mold sibling of the head (see catalogue) shows a round, kittenish face more Attic than Corinthian in style, although the frontal pose of the head is not "Tanagraean." Three small and not very well made mantled figurines are best included here, since in all the left arm was posed as in H105 and H106, down at the side and grasping the edge of the mantle. In H107 and H108, the mantle covered the head; a mold sibling of H108, MF-1976-88 in the Corinth collection (P1. 75), preserves the head, which is somewhat similar in type to C95, although much smaller, with the hair bound in a knot on top of the head. The pose of H109 is somewhat uncertain, since the right arm, which was never completely formed, leans on a pillar, but the figurine is of interest because its two-stepped base is preserved. From better workshops come two mantled heads and upper torsos, H 10 and Hill. H 10 has the left arm akimbo, like a "Sophoclean," but the incompletely preserved right arm was at the side, perhaps originally holding something against the leg. The composition recalls a mantled dancer type discussed below (H153-H157, see pp. 153-154), but the absence of a flying panel of drapery behind the left arm suggests that the figurine is in a quietly standing pose. The face has deep shadows, formed both by the pleated mantle fold overhanging the forehead and by 178 Kleiner 1984, pp. 95-105, pl. 5. 179 Richter 1965, I, p. 129, no. 2, fig. 680, the Lateran type.</page><page sequence="169">DISCUSSION 145 the "Skopasian" eyes, deeply set and downturned below prominent brows. The style of the face would date the prototype about the middle of the 4th century B.C.180 Hill, although similarly draped, is very different in its very narrow, sloping shoulders and its wide-eyed, alert, girlish face, without dramatic shadowing. Beneath the mantle, the hair is piled high and bound across the forehead in a sakkos, a coiffure found also in mantled dancers (e.g., H170). Yet despite their differences, both H110 and Hill show some similarity to a very fine group of reported Corinthian provenience in the Louvre,181 representing two standing girls, one a mantled figurine, the other differently draped and holding a ball. The girlish face of Hill is quite similar to that of the mantled figure of the group, except that her mantle forms an overhanging peak, as in H 10;182 the intense, more emotional face of H 10, however, is more like that of the girl with the ball. Clearly there is no direct mechanical relationship among these figurines, but the similarities point to some connection in the use of workshop materials, combined in different ways. The isolated mantled head H 12 could have belonged to a figurine similar in type to Hill but with a higher, more pointed coiffure. The poorly defined, expressionless features recall the head of the mantled dancers H153 and H154, but the pose of HI 12 seems to be frontal. The very high, pointed sakkos recalls an Attic head type from the Pnyx, dated to the early 4th century B.C.183 Given the general preference of Corinthian coroplasts for broad effects, it is not surprising that they successfully produced a mantled type in which the cloth was draped like a tent over the torso, allowing for a pattern of sweeping folds. HI 13 and HI 14 are fragmentary examples of the type, which is better illustrated by a fully preserved Corinthian example in New York.184 If, as its fold pattern suggests, HI 13 belonged to this type, the mantle would have fallen to the knees in a series of deep catenaries from the hidden right arm to the left wrist, over which the folds of the open edge of the mantle were draped; the chest is preserved, with curving folds across the shoulders and rib cage framing the breasts. The head of the New York figurine, with a Knidian coiffure and long locks of hair at the nape, is not precisely paralleled at the Demeter sanctuary, but heads in the Corinth collection are similar.185 H 14 differs in several respects: the shoulders are narrower and more sloping; the fold pattern, as far as it is preserved, is different and shows a loose roll of folds around the neck, with an end of the mantle tucked in from the back; and the left hand may have been at the chest, beneath the mantle. Several fragments of mantled figurines are not sufficiently preserved to accurately reconstruct their original types. H115 shows the right arm akimbo; its excellent fabric makes the lack of typological information all the more regrettable. It is from a pottery context terminating at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The type of H 16, also beautifully made, is somewhat less mysterious by virtue of a few clues. A deep vertical fold to the left of the missing left foot must have arisen from some movement higher on the figure. It could be the fold dropping from the strongly outthrust left hip of"Sophoclean" figurines.186 In the pose of the feet, the arrangement of the hemline, and the folds curving up from the right foot there is a resemblance to a popular 180 On the chronology of the Tegea sculpture and the prob- lems of its attribution, see Ridgway 1997, pp. 48-52, with bibliography. 181 Louvre III, p. 53, no.

An example in Boston, with the mantle drawn over the head (Coroplast's Art, p. 112, no. 5), is of reported Corinthian provenience, but the clay, although pale, is not really typical of Corinth and the modeling of the folds is rather drier than usual; the fold pattern, however, does recall the New York figurine. 185 E.g., MF-3875, Corinth XII, p. 47, no. 288, pl. 24, there dated to the 3rd century B.C. 186 E.g., Kleiner 1984, pp. 95-105, pl. 5.</page><page sequence="170">146 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS "Tanagra" type with many variants, holding the drapery forward over the hands;187 in this case, the deep vertical fold would have fallen from the hand rather than the hip. The figurine is wide and relatively shallow and may originally have had a long, rectangular base. It is similar in scale and style to H88, and in the somewhat flat-footed look occasioned by the trailing hem over feet set fairly close together, but it is much better in the quality of the fabric; its archetype probably dates to about the same time, probably no later than the third quarter of the 4th century B.C. H 16 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Since a possible mold of the type of H88 was found in the Potters' Quarter (see p. 142), it may be that mantled figurines of good quality were produced there during the third quarter of the 4th century B.C., before the demise of the workshops ca. 320 B.C. HI 17 is a smaller mantled figurine of equally good quality that is to some extent a mirror image of HI 16. In this case, the skirt folds are looped from the advanced left foot towards the right hip; at the other side, a group of folds radiates from the top of the thigh. As far as it is preserved, the piece is sufficiently close in size and fold pattern to a group of Boeotian figurines in Boston188 to suggest collateral molds or perhaps a common archetype. Perhaps significantly, the fragmentary ephedrismos group H390 (see p. 201), which is of the same fine fabric as H117, has a probable mechanical relationship with a Boeotian rendering of the ephedrismos type.189 Perhaps the parallel between these two cases points to an exchange of workshop materials between certain workshops of Corinth and one of the Boeotian centers. This particular composition is not typical of Athenian "Tanagras." HI 18 is a fragment of another figurine in a mantle reaching nearly to the feet, in this case with looped folds over the right ankle; its plaque base has been preserved. It is from a pottery context terminating at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Several fragments show a shorter mantle. In one of these (HI 19), the identification of the costume is not entirely clear. The figurine does not show the differentiation in the weight of the cloth of chiton and mantle usually seen in mantled figurines. The mantle(?) hem is gathered up at the left thigh, with a fold pattern reminiscent of the way the votary H3 gathers up the hem of her peplos overfold at the hip. The hem of H119, however, in its complete form would have fallen at the right side at least to the knees. While a peplos overfold of that length is not impossible, it is longer than those usually seen on Corinthian figurines. Moreover, the cluster of folds gathered at the side looks like the open edges of the garment clumped together, and the peplos is normally open at the right side rather than the left. The composition of H120, a smaller and much less well made figurine, is similar in the drapery arrangement, although in this case the coroplast made an attempt to render a mantle of thinner cloth than the skirt. The type is not likely to be identical to the foregoing figurines, since the left knee is bent, and the stance therefore was different. The oval base with torus moldings is preserved. H121 preserves a similar upward sweep of the hem of a thin mantle, but the figurine is of a completely different type, in which the ankles are crossed and the left side leans against a columnar support. Coroplasts made use of this composition mainly in representations of the seminude Aphrodite,190 but the upper torso of H121 must have been entirely draped, since the ends of the mantle hang beside the support as if falling from the left shoulder. Since the figure stands at an angle and seems to have leaned heavily against the support, and there is no sign of the left arm at the side, it is likely that the left elbow originally was propped on top of the column. Such a composition can be seen in a fragmentary figurine in Berlin of reported Corinthian provenience,191 although the drapery arrangement does not seem to be the same. The cross-legged, leaning pose of H121 is also found in H146, which wears only a chiton; its 187 Kleiner 1984, p. 11, pl. 2:c, d. 188 Coroplast's Art, p. 111, no. 4. 189 Coroplast's Art, p. 128. 190 E.g., British Museum I, pp. 194-195, no. 728, pl. 95 (Attic, mid-4th century B.C.). 191 Winter, Typen II, p. 82, no. 3. See also the imported, draped Argive figurine 110.</page><page sequence="171">DISCUSSION 147 good workmanship is sufficiently close to that of H121 to suggest that they were made in the same workshop. In H122, the drapery arrangement is reversed; the thin mantle falls to the knee at the left side and is gathered at the right hip, where a cluster of folds suggests that it was originally grasped in the hand;192 the figurine is preserved with its plaque base. H123 is much more Classical in style than the more Hellenistic versions of a figurine in chiton and mantle discussed above. The mantle is rolled down over the abdomen into a triangular overfold with a curved edge, similar to that of H85 but smaller, and drooping below the waist into a graceful curve, in the manner of Classical sculpture of the later 5th century B.C.; also Classical are the transparent chiton folds clinging to the right breast but leaving the shoulder bare,193 and the sturdy proportions of the torso. For all the Classicism ofH123, however, there is currently no evidence for a series of Corinthian 5th-century B.C. female figurines in chiton and mantle to which it could have belonged. The closest connection to local 5th-century B.C. work is its resemblance in drapery arrangement and partly in pose to the dancer C282, although in a much simplified form. H123 can best be related in pose, drapery arrangement, and proportions to a fine Corinthian figurine in Athens, depicting Aphrodite and Eros (P1. 78).194 The Aphrodite's mantle drops in a heavy fall below the left forearm and is worn as a veil over the head, which in addition shows a polos and the long, streaming locks of hair usually seen in Corinthian votaries. H123 is cruder and simpler, but a slight rim bordering the left forearm suggests that a mantle fall has been cut away from the left side. In addition, a small projection below the right elbow, without an organic relation to the drapery, could be the remains of the figure of Eros cut away from the right side. If this interpretation is correct, the right arm would have been repositioned across the abdomen when the archetype of H123 was made. The long locks of hair of the Aphrodite are also preserved on the shoulders ofH123. Since this figurine is from a pottery context dating to the last quarter of the 4th century B.C., it can help to confirm a 4th-century B.C. date for the Aphrodite figurine, which is sometimes dated too late, in the 3rd century B.C. Whether H123 also represents Aphrodite is another question. The long hair could serve for a votary figurine, although the costume is not typical. The hand on the abdomen calls to mind the votaries H43-H45, although these figurines represent girls rather than mature women and hold the opposite hand to the abdomen; H123 may simply be grasping the mantle roll. Since the compositional parallel with the Aphrodite in Athens is strong, it seems most likely that H123 did represent the goddess, although without the accompanying Eros. Whatever the subject of this figurine, it is clear that the 4th-century B.C. coroplastic workshops of Corinth produced not only survivals of 5th-century B.C. types and new compositions with the stylistic features of Early Hellenistic plastic art but also new and highly competent designs in a style that was firmly rooted in the art of the later 5th century B.C. H124 shows an arrangement of the mantle similar to H123, but its essentially Hellenistic style is revealed in the higher girding of the chiton and the tighter wrapping of the mantle around the waist, as in H85. In H125, the mantle is draped over the left shoulder and bent arm as in H123, but it falls diagonally across the torso from the right shoulder to the left hip; its hem is lifted up at the other side by the raised right forearm. While the composition is built upon triangular forms, as are "Tanagra" types, there is none of the play of tension folds that is one of the defining characteristics of "Tanagras" and therefore no reason to make that connection. In addition to an example in Athens of reported Corinthian provenience,195 there are others from Italy and Sicily,196 suggesting that this type could have been developed by the prolific and skilled West Greek coroplasts.197 192 Cf. Kleiner 1984, p. 53, pl. 8:a. 193 The best-known rendering is the garment of the Nike untying her sandal from the balustrade of the Temple of Athena Nike: conveniently, Lullies and Hirmer 1960, pl. 191. 194 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160; see p. 130, note 88. 195 Winter, Typen II, p. 14, no. 4b. 196 E.g., Winter, Typen II, p. 14, no. 4d. 197 On the rich repertoire of draped female types developed in the West, see Morgantina, pp. 51-64; Coroplast'sArt, pp. 64-70, both with bibliography.</page><page sequence="172">148 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS The rather poorly made H125 might then have been a copy of a West Greek type. It was found in a pottery context of the later 4th century B.C. In the crudely reworked and fragmentary H126, the torso would have been closely wrapped in the mantle, the upper edge rolled and draped diagonally from the right shoulder. In the well-known version of this mantle arrangement on the Mantineia base,198 and also on a figurine of reported Corinthian provenience,199 the rolled edge drops over the left wrist. In H126, however, the type was altered and the roll anchored at the hip under the left hand. H127 preserves only the right hand clutching a fold cascade, but the fragment is sufficiently distinctive to suggest the original type. The complete figurine originally may have resembled a figurine of Corinthian provenience in Athens,200 which wears a chiton and a small mantle draped over the left shoulder and bent arm; the cloth is draped around the back and reappears at the right thigh, where the hand grasps the end of the mantle in a cascade of folds. A similar cascade, now missing, must originally have been part of the drapery scheme of H47, which represents a young girl. A probable mold sibling ofH127 was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. (see catalogue). In the draped female figurines that follow, the distinctive element is the mantle roll slung from hip to hip to frame the abdomen, which is revealed almost as if nude beneath the transparent cloth of the chiton. This drapery scheme, which had its origins in late-5th-century B.C. Athenian sculpture, particularly in the Nikai of the parapet of the Temple of Athena Nike,201 was used in 4th-century B.C. sculpture and reliefs in a variety of subjects.202 The best-known example of its use is in the 3rd-century B.. Themis of Rhamnous;203 by theis 2nd century B.C. it is so common as to be almost a clich.204 Most of the Corinthian figurines that feature drapery of this kind appear to belong to the 3rd century B.C. The clinging Hellenistic chiton usually worn beneath the mantle can be better observeed in the unmantled figurines discussed in the following section. The overtly sensual pose, which emphasizes the nearly nude abdomen naturally suggests that at least some of these figures, if they are goddesses, represent Aphrodite. This identification makes some sense in the context of the Demeter sanctuary, in which clearly recognizable figurines of Aphrodite were offered (see pp. 172-174). Other identifications, however, are sometimes indicated. A statue draped in this way found in the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos has been tentatively identified as Kore, since Aphrodite is not otherwise represented at that shrine.205 While the finds from the Acrocorinth sanctuary suggest that representations of Aphrodite were appropriate in a shrine of Demeter, a figure so draped definitely does represent Kore on a relief from Eleusis.206 A figurine from Syracuse in a similar costume also is though to depict Kore.207 On the other hand, a figurine of reported Corinthian provenience in Berlin is so draped but represents a mortal woman holding a duck.208 Among the Acrocorinth figurines, H128, leaning languidly against a pillar and wearing a sleeveless, transparent chiton, has two attributes that suggest Artemis, a long torch and a diagonal band across the chest that could be a baldric, although there is no sign of a quiver.209 The 198 Todisco 1993, pl. 289. 199 Winter, Typen II, p. 24, no. 1. 200 Winter, 7ypen II, p. 71, no. 1. 201 Conveniently, Lullies and Hirmer 1960, pl. 191. 202 Palagia 1982, p. 100, note 3; M.

In H128, the left arm is sharply bent and the hand, covered by mantle folds wrapped around the wrist like a bracelet, lifts the mantle roll to the hip. The fragment H129, however, speaks of a different composition in which the bare hand supports the folds of the mantle roll lower down, probably at the top of the thigh. H130 is yet another version, in statuette scale. In this figurine, the hand is not preserved, but a clump of drapery at the hip suggests that the cloth was secured there. The steep angle of the mantle roll and the broad rendering of the drapery recall a large Corinthian Hellenistic terracotta figure (MF- 13017) thought to represent a maenad (PI. 76). On the basis of style, H130 could be Middle Hellenistic in date. Its thin-walled, slightly coarse fabric suggests a workshop link with the "Rhodian Aphrodite" H140 and three other draped female figurines of different types (Workshop K, see p. 346). Two much smaller, nearly miniature figurines, H131 and H132, preserve more of the composition. In H132, the remains of drapery in the back and the raised right arm suggest that the mantle originally was lifted high in the right hand, in a composition usually associated with Leda or Aphrodite (see p. 174). The small size and rather poor quality of this figurine suggest that it may stand at the end of a long mold series. The poorly made and preserved H133 originally had a raised right arm and seems to have been similar in type to H132. In H131, the mantle roll is draped over the left forearm. In this more ladylike version, the right arm is at the side and the chiton is not transparent; the narrow-shouldered, high-girded torso is reminiscent of small votary figurines such as H37, on which this type may well have been constructed. H134 is poorly preserved, but the elements that are clear include a high-girded chiton and a mantle dropping steeply from the left upper arm toward the missing right hip. In this case, the drapery scheme includes a heavy mantle fall at the left side, a feature consonant with the date of this figurine, which is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Another figurine in Corinth (MF-7417) may be of similar type;210 it shows the steep angle of the mantle roll and preserves the right side, with the shoulder lowered and the arm akimbo. In H135, which originally leaned on a support at the left side, the mantle also drops from the upper arm, and in this case from the shoulder as well, but here the upper edge of the mantle is not rolled. Short-waisted proportions similar to H128 are found in H136, in which the only evidence for the mantle roll is a preserved fragment at the right hip. As far as the figurine is preserved, the proportions and composition match a figurine of reported Corinthian provenience in Berlin.211 Clearly, there is great variety within this group, as was the case also among figurines more closely wrapped in the mantle, and it is not possible to point to any predominant type that could have had strong cultic significance. Where there is reason to identify a figurine as a deity, the goddesses suggested by attributes or pose are Artemis and Aphrodite. With the exception of H134, there is no reason to date any of this group earlier than the 3rd century B.C., and at least one member may actually be Middle Hellenistic. In two fragmentary figurines (H137 and H138), the mantle, lifted in the left hand, falls like a curtain behind the arm, in a composition recalling the Classical peplos-figurine C36. Parallels in sculptured reliefs suggest that C36 represents Demeter (see p. 36), but H138 wears a fairly high-girded chiton, a garment less characteristic of Demeter than the peplos. Since possible representations of the nude Aphrodite also lift the mantle in a gesture recalling the anakalypteria of a bride (see p. 174), perhaps these two figurines represent Aphrodite rather than Demeter. Both pieces in their original state were large and of good quality. The scale of H138, its thin 210 Corinth XII, p. 56, no. 390, pl. 35; probably not dancing, as suggested there, and not Roman in date. 211 Winter, Typen II, p. 60, no. 7.</page><page sequence="174">150 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS walls, and the high girding of the chiton could bring it into connection with the workshop group (Workshop K, see p. 346) that includes the "Rhodian Aphrodite" H140. The pottery context of H138 terminates in the Hellenistic period, that of H137 in the early 3rd century B.C. STANDING DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES: WITHOUT MANTLE (H139-H152) The pieces discussed in this section are clothed in a manner found in both Hellenistic sculpture and figurines, in which the female form is enhanced by a clinging, high girded chiton, usually without an overfold and sometimes sleeveless.212 While these figurines, in their mostly fragmentary condition, do not preserve mantles, at least two (H139 and H140) may in their complete state have been cloaked. H139 shows a fold from the right shoulder to the waist that is deeper than the corresponding fold at the left side and therefore could have belonged to a mantle. In H140, the arched folds over the originally advanced left thigh suggest that we have a variant, with pose reversed, of the "Rhodian Aphrodite" type.213 In this type, the mantle does not cover the torso but falls over one shoulder and bent arm, then is draped around the back of the figure, and finally arches over the advanced opposite thigh. In a nice detail of the large and well-made H140, the two smallest fingers push aside a fold, perhaps of a mantle, beside the right thigh. It is possible that this figurine represents Aphrodite. H141 in its complete form is known to have been unmantled, since a mold sibling in the Corinth collection (MF- 11457, P1. 76) preserves the entire type. The slender, shapely figure leans languidly toward the right side against a column, the top of which is draped, presumably with the divested mantle. The sleeved, high-girded, clinging chiton droops from the left shoulder. The coiffure shows a lampadion knot on top of the head and long locks of hair falling loosely over the shoulders. Taking together the pose, the revealing costume, the stately but provocative demeanor, and the long locks of hair, which appear on a Corinthian figurine of Aphrodite and Eros in Athens (P1. 78),214 it seems fair to identify MF-l 1457 and H141 as Aphrodite. Perhaps the same identification holds for H142, which is in mirror image and probably leaned on a support under the left elbow; its drooping chiton sleeve and long hair add to its resemblance to H141. The subjects of the remaining figurines in this group are less clear. H139 seems slightly off balance, as if leaning toward the left side, yet there are no signs of a support; the arms originally could have been raised toward the head, perhaps to arrange the hair. The right shoulder ofH143 is lifted, as if the figure originally leaned on a support in the manner of H141. The proportions, however, are much more matronly. The tantalizing fragment (H144) of what must have been a very fine, large figure of sculptural style, shows the belt knotted just beneath the breasts. It reveals little about its subject, unless it is the same as that of H145, which has a similarly knotted belt. In H145, the diagonal backward sweep of the skirt folds and the corresponding movement of the belt ties indicate that the figure is in motion, perhaps running, as in the ephedrismos type (see p. 201). It could also represent a flying Nike (see pp. 183-184). These two figurines, together with H130, H140, and possibly H138, could constitute a workshop group (Workshop K, see p. 346). They are all large in scale and thin-walled; two of them (H130 and H144) have similar, slightly coarse fabric; and all are of related types. Two figurines preserving only the lower parts (H146 and H147) show no traces of mantle folds on or around the skirts. H146 leans to the left side with ankles crossed, in a pose similar to the mantled H121. A different, more sensual atmosphere is conveyed, however, by revealing the leg 212 On this garment, see Higgins 1986, pp. 120-121. 213 This type is known in Corinth in a Roman stone statuette, S-429: see Ridgway 1990, pp. 216-217, with bibliography on pp. 239-240, note 8, pl. 100. 214 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160; see p. 130, note 88.</page><page sequence="175">DISCUSSION 151 through the clinging cloth and placing the right hand saucily on the hip. H147 is noteworthy for its particularly fine fabric, which places it in the 4th century; its pottery context terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The rather short hem that touches the insteps without trailing is consonant with a relatively early date; the garment could be a peplos rather than a chiton. The final figurine to be discussed with this group is the skirt fragment H148. There are no signs of a mantle in the front, but the bottom of a cascade of folds is preserved beside the left ankle. Mantle folds therefore may have fallen from above, perhaps lifted and carried behind the figure. Instead of the pointed slippers common among standing draped female types, this figurine wears sandals with fairly high, shaped soles, over which the skirt hem collapses. Two figurines (H149 and H150) are related ine the pose of the arms to the popular mantled "pudicitia" type known in both "Tanagra" figurines215 and sculpture.216 In this type, one forearm is stretched across the waist to the opposite elbow; the hand of the opposite arm reaches toward the face. The pose makes somewhat more sense in a mantled figure, in which at least one hand holds the drapery in place. In the miniature H149, which preserves the composition best, there is a hem across the ankles that could belong to a mantle. Since the forearms are bare, however, the chiton probably has a double hem. In H150, which preserves the shoulders better, there clearly are no signs of a mantle. Mantled figures in this pose in both small and large scale usually represent mortal women; in sculpture the pose is a stock type for portraits.217 The context of the hand-to-elbow, hand-to-face gesture is also sometimes funerary, as in its repeated use in the Mourning Women Sarcophagus.218 It seems fair, therefore, to identify H149 and H150 as mortal women, although nymphs are also known in this pose.219 The type does not seem to have enjoyed the same popularity in Corinth as in other centers. H151 lacks the left forearm, but it may be another example of the "pudicitia" type. H152 is unusual in composition; it recalls the "pudicitia" type in that the right forearm lies across the waist, but in this case the hand may lift a fold of drapery (of a mantle?), and the left arm hangs at the side. The raised right shoulder gives a sense of movement; although there is no torsion, one feels there ought to be and is reminded of the unstable, twisting movement of the Heyl Aphrodite in Berlin,220 although the pose is not identical. All the figurines of this group are short waisted in proportion and show fairly broad, but rounded shoulders, high breasts, and plump arms; the upper arms are short in consequence of the short waist. Such proportions are reminiscent of 4th-century B.C. Peloponnesian sculpture, as seen, for example, in the Temple of Asklepios at Epidauros.221 The miniature H149, which probably belongs to the end of a mold series, is somewhat elongated in the lower torso and legs. None of this group should be earlier than the 3rd century B.C., and a Middle Hellenistic date is possible, particularly for H149. DANCERS AND RELATED HEADS (H153-H174) The ritual use of dance in the worship of certain deities, including Demeter and Kore, has been well established on archaeological and literary grounds.222 Figurines of mantled dancers presumably represent mortal women dancing to honor the deities in whose sanctuaries they are found, and given the pleasure derived from this activity, it is not surprising that mantled dancer 215 Kleiner 1984, pp. 160-165, pl. 33. 216 Bieber 1961, pp. 132-133. 217 E.g., the Cleopatra from Delos: Marcade 1969, pp. 132- 134, pl.

There are few references to music in the material remains from the Acrocorinth sanctuary (the model lyre V13, the youths and a banqueter with lyres C190, C193, C217, the piping satyr and Pan C274 and C277, and the aulos held by C86). Another problem is the lack of an obviously suitable place for dancing. The Theater on the Upper Terrace, like the theatral area of the Classical period, seems to have been intended for viewers only, not performers, but dancing could have taken place in the Middle Terrace central courtyard, which was expanded after ca. 300 B.c.; from here it could have been seen by spectators gathered in the Theater above.226 In light of the popularity of mantled dancers and other dancing figurines as vo- tive offerings, it seems perverse not to allow that dances were performed in a sanctuary that housed the worship of two major fertility goddesses, accompanied at least by Dionysos and Aphrodite (see pp. 330-332), who are themselves associated with dancing. In fact, the question may be not whether or not people danced at the sanctuary but to which deities the dances were directed. Figurines of mantled dancers were dedicated to Demeter in other sanctuaries, including those of Priene, Pergamon, and Kharayeb.227 It is also possible that Dionysos received such offerings at the Acrocorinth sanctuary. In Athenian red-figured vase painting, mantled dancers are sometimes associated with Dionysos.228 For example, a bell-krater in Athens shows two mantled dancers in the company of Dionysos, a satyr, and Eros.229 The association with fertility is in any case unmistakable on an oinochoe in Oxford, where a mantled woman dances in company with an ithyphallic dwarf and a winged phallos.230 The engraved interior of a bronze mirror cover of reported Corinthian provenience shows a mantled woman holding a thyrsos and dancing before an altar wreathed with ivy and laurel, on which perches a piping Eros, wearing a wreath; the altar is inscribed 4IAOIIAI, and there is the outline of a mountain in the background.231 Although Dionysos is not shown, references to him in the thyrsos and ivy are present, and the mirror would then parallel the bell-krater in the combining of dancers with Eros and Dionysos. The thyrsos should identify the woman as a maenad, although maenads are more commonly identified by the fawnskin in combination with loose hair and bare feet;232 this costume is prevalent in art, although the maenads performed their mountain dances in the winter, when they might be expected to be wrapped well against the cold. Yet another engraved mirror cover of reported Corinthian provenience shows two mantled women dancing on rocky ground; the edges of the mirror are broken, but an alabastron can be seen and a head, probably of a satyr or Pan, watching the dance.233 Since only a few figurines of mantled dancers, and no kalathiskos dancers, have as yet been found at Corinth outside the Acrocorinth sanctuary,234 we can surmise that these types were particularly associated with the Acrocorinth cultic area. Do the mirrors, 223 Generally on these dancers, see Hampe and Simon 1959, p. 34. 224 D. B.

The Corinthian dancers in collections outside Corinth, which are completely preserved, were probably taken from graves.</page><page sequence="177">DISCUSSION 153 if the Corinthian provenience is correct, then also refer to rituals connected in some way with the Demeter sanctuary? This suggestion may not be so farfetched, since Dionysos appears to have been worshiped there (see p. 332), and both Dionysos and Eros are represented among the figurines. Was the Corinthian maenads' mountain Acrocorinth? Was a winter festival held there parallel to the Athenian Lenaia, which took place in mid-winter and which included the revels of maenads?235 The mantled dancers could also refer to marriage. The Classical kalathiskos dancers are thought to represent professional dancers who served fertility cults and may have been cultically related to marriage (see p. 58). While the meaning of mantled dancing may have varied according to the deity for whom it was performed, it is conceivable that in the Acrocorinth sanctuary dancing continued to refer to marriage in the Hellenistic period. If this is correct, do the mantled dancers represent the brides themselves? Literary and visual evidence for Greek weddings does not suggest dancing brides,236 but brides are known to have been heavily veiled before the anakalypteria237 and are sometimes represented muffled to the eyes, as are some of the dancers. Examples of marital contexts for this costume include a clay impression from a mirror showing Dionysos and Eros with a bride,238 found in the Athenian Agora, and Attic and South Italian red-figured vases.239 If the dancers were not actually brides, the costume, in any case, may have been intended to suggest marriage. Both the kalathiskos dancers and some of the mantled dancers from the Acrocorinth sanctuary were produced at the Potters' Quarter, but only the mantled dancers continued to be made into the 3rd century B.C., after the demise of the Potters' Quarter workshops. Whether the replacement of one type by another in the Acrocorinth sanctuary was a function of the marketplace or really represented some change in ritual custom is unclear. There are several variants among the mantled dancers from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, but they share a few features in common. All dance to the viewer's left and are meant to be seen in three-quarter view; from the movement of the dance, the drapery flies out to the viewer's right; the mantle is all-enveloping, concealing other garments almost completely; the left arm is akimbo or at least partially bent. Variations occur in the position of the right arm, in the pattern of drapery folds, and in the way the cloth is draped around the head. The best-preserved mantled dancer from the sanctuary is H153. In pose and drapery arrangement, this figurine closely resembles Attic and Boeotian types of the middle and third quarter of the 4th century B.C.240 In this version of the dance, the left ankle crosses the right, the mantle hem flares out widely in response to the movement, and the right arm is folded over the chest, with a spray of folds arching from the right hand over the left hip. The thin cloth molds the abdomen and thighs like a second skin but without revealing detail beneath, giving the peculiar impression of being at the same time both transparent and opaque. Although an undergarment hem is visible at the ankles, there are no traces of neckline folds on the upper chest. The lack of detail may in part be due to the polishing of the surface characteristic of Workshop I, in which it was made (see p. 346). For example, the sense in the Boeotian version that the right arm is supported in a sling of mantle cloth, which it pulls down tautly from the neck, is not clearly apparent in H153, and the details of the right 235 Deubner 1956, pp. 123-134; Parke 1977, pp. 104-106; Simon 1983, pp. 100-101.

The head, also preserved in H154, is characterized by an expressionless face with ill-defined features reduced to essentials and by hair piled on top and enveloped in a sakkos; the headdress is pulled low across the forehead, where it is marked by a narrow border. Although superficially attractive, this type seems to be derivative, presumably from an Attic or Boeotian source. The pattern of nearly parallel curving folds marking the flying panel beside the left leg recalls the simplified, repetitive fold systems of such 4th-century B.C. lingering Classical renderings as the Nereid monument from Xanthos.241 H153 and H154 probably were made in the same workshop (Workshop I, see p. 346) as the draped female figurines H100, H101, and three additional figurines (see catalogue). Both figurines are from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. H156 is a smaller dancer generally similar in type to the above but with a different right arm position. The forearm is missing, but the nature of the break suggests that the right forearm was upright and swathed in the mantle, as in the standing draped figurine H100 (see p. 143). A fully preserved dancer of reported Corinthian provenience in Boston has a similarly raised and covered hand,242 as does a mantled dancer on an Apulian red-figured oinochoe.243 The arm does not pull the mantle down from the neck, as in H153, but the cloth is flung over the neck and shoulder like a scarf, covering the chin. The figure in Boston dances on a footstool with lion's feet, kicking one leg out behind her; perhaps H156 also danced on a footstool. A figurine of reported Corinthian provenience in Athens is another footstool dancer.244 The particularly smooth, rounded contours of H156 call to mind the standing figure of a nymph on a 3rd-century B.C. bronze mirror found in a grave in Corinth.245 Footstool dancers, however, must have been made in Athens much earlier, since an already derivative version was found in the Athenian Agora in a context of the late 5th-first quarter of the 4th century B.C.246 H156, therefore, is likely to be a reworking in Hellenistic style of an Athenian Classical type. H155 is only a fragment, but, as far as preserved, it follows the composition of H156. It is the largest of the dancer figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, approaching statuette scale.247 Some retouch of the drapery in H157 altered the type so that the upper edge of the mantle crosses the chest and left forearm in a thick roll. The missing right forearm in this case seems to have been held down and away from the torso, perhaps to hold out a fold of the skirt. The smooth fit of the cloth over the torso has been retained. H159 resembles H156 in scale and in the arrangement of the mantle like a scarf over the chin. The fold pattern, however, connects it with H158, in which the left arm is not akimbo but only slightly bent and held at the side. Four other mantled dancers also have lowered left arms (H160-H163), and in these the left hand grasps the mantle folds beside the hip. In H160 and H161, a long fan of backward-flying folds hangs from the hand nearly to the hem. H161 is the best preserved of this group, showing that in this type the dancer does not cross her ankles but strides forward with her right leg. The right arm is folded across the chest and pulls down at the neckline folds, somewhat in the manner of H153. In H163, the left arm is straight and pulls the skirt folds to the side. Three mantled dancers (H164-H166) are of smaller scale, the last two being nearly minia- tures. H164 is of a type known in complete examples, also of small scale, recorded from Athens 241 Childs and Demargne 1989, e.g., pp. 123-124, no. BM 911, pl. 86; pp. 125-126, no.

The left leg still crosses over the right but now at the knees rather than the ankles, creating a bolder, less mincing movement than in H153. The left arm is sharply bent, with a cascade of zigzag folds dropping from the hand to the hem; the right hand pulls some drapery folds around from the back to the abdomen. The mantle covers the lower part of the face. The composition is very well conceived, but the impression of H164 is dull and the workmanship is indifferent, suggesting that it may have been mechanically copied from an imported figurine. The mold siblings H165 and H166 taken together provide the remains of a lovely mantled dancer type, in which the dancer steps forward on the right leg, while twisting her head and shoulders to the viewer's left. The lower part of the face is covered by the mantle, which once again drops over the left shoulder like a scarf. The torsion is not as great as in H164, but the intention to show the turning movement of the dance is similar. Also contributing to the sense of motion is the elaborate drapery pattern. Both hands lift the mantle from beneath the cloth to free the legs for the dance, showing the skirt of the garment beneath, the hem of which is rendered by bent tubular folds opening into omegas; above these, the mantle hem billows into a deep sanguisuga249 fold. In Attic sculpture, such exaggerated drapery patterns are typical of figures in motion, dating to the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 4th century B.C., such as a Nike akroterion from the Temple of Ares in the Athenian Agora.250 The torsion of the figurines, however, suggests a later date, not before the second quarter of the 4th century B.c.251 Since another mold sibling was found in the Potters' Quarter (see catalogue), a terminus ante quem of the 320s B.C., when the workshops in that area ceased production, is provided. The miniature scale of these figurines should not in this case point to a late generation, since the detail of H166 is quite clear. Rather, we are probably dealing with a terracotta adaptation of a small metal figure, possibly Attic, of late Classical style.252 Although such metal figurines are lacking in the archaeological record, Attic terracotta figurines of forward-stepping dancers are known in several variants (see p. 80). Presumably, the torsion of the Corinthian version was a later addition, effected by twisting back the shoulders. These figurines are probably the earliest of the Corinthian mantled dancers, dating perhaps to the middle or third quarter of the 4th century B.C. They may have been made in the same workshop (Workshop C, see p. 345) as the comic figurines H365 and H367. A fragment of the lower part of a figurine, showing the garment hems with motion folds (H167), may belong to a mantled dancer. If so, the position of the foot suggests that we have here a different type, showing a dancer moving forward with feet apart.253 A bent, tubular mantle fold opening into an omega is preserved, suggesting that this figurine also is in the later Classical tradition; its drapery style brings to mind the treatment of hem folds in the sculpture of the Temple of Asklepios at Epidauros, which is dated ca. 380-370 B.C.254 The two small dancers H168 and H169 have a superficial similarity to one another in scale and style but are differently composed. The better-preserved H168 moves directly forward with 248 Winter, Typen II, p. 145, no. 3; no. 4 is similar but larger and with less torsion; Corinth XV, ii, pp. 126-127, sub no. 26, with bibliography; Schurmann 1989, p. 40, no. 85, pl. 18. 249 For this term, see Ridgway 1981a, p. xviii (the fold is shaped like a swollen leech). 250 Delivorrias 1974, pp. 124-125, pls. 44, 45. 251 Torsion is usually associated with sculpture of the later 4th century B.C. at the earliest, but actually it is found ca. 375 B.c. in the west central akroterion of the Asklepieion at Epidauros: Yalouris 1992, pp. 30-31, no. 25, pl. 26:b. I owe this obser- vation to Brunilde S. Ridgway. 252 On the derivation of small terracottas from metal figures, see D. B. Thompson 1966, pp. 54-55. 253 In the composition of the legs, the figurine might have resembled the right-hand dancer of a group of two in Is- tanbul: Mendel 1908, pp. 176-177, no. 1868, pl. IV:2.

Both, however, show very slender proportions and drapery so closely wrapped and unarticulated over the torsos and legs that the figures seem nude. The garment of H169 thickens at the hem and is probably a mantle, like the very smooth and closely fitted garment of H153. These two small figures are likely to be later derivatives of the larger, better-detailed mantled dancers and probably date to the 3rd century B.C. Five mantled heads probably belonged to dancers. H170 seems to have leaned backward originally or to the viewer's left. The right hand is brought up to the mouth under the mantle, which covers the face up to the eyes. The headdress is the veiled, high sakkos typical of this group. A dancer of nearly miniature scale (H171) preserves the head and a little of the shoulders. H171 seems originally to have moved to the viewer's left, with the head tilted to the viewer's right. The mantle is drawn across the mouth. This head is unusual in that the facial features are clearly detailed, showing very large eyes. Another of similar type and scale (see catalogue) shows less detail but is noteworthy because the pose seems to be reversed and because it is from a datable context, the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. H172 preserves only the head; there is no sign of movement, but since the face is muffled to the eyes, as is H170, the head could have belonged to a mantled dancer. There is no discernible reason why in some heads only the chin is covered, in others the chin and mouth, and in others the nose as well.255 The last two heads wear a kerchief rather than a sakkos. The kerchief with eye slits was another form of facial covering, although they are usually represented pulled across the forehead, with the loose cloth draped to either side of the head, leaving the face bare.256 H173, in which the kerchief is covered by the mantle, matches the head of a dancer of reported Corinthian provenience.257 In both, the eye slits of the kerchief are lacking, a triangle of hair shows at each temple, and the mantle is wrapped tightly across the neck to the left shoulder. In the complete figurine, the head would not be seen frontally as illustrated here but glancing down over the right shoulder to the feet. The dancer advances to the viewer's right in a free, almost galloping movement, with swinging skirts. Dancers in such free movement are generally more characteristic of West Greek than mainland Greek renderings,258 but two fragments of swinging drapery from the Acrocorinth sanctuary could point to such types.259 In the other head wearing a kerchief (H174), the eye slits are rendered correctly. In this figurine, the mantle did not veil the head; the right hand draws the cloth up to the mouth in a manner resembling H170, although only the chin is covered. There are no signs of movement in the figurine, as far as it is preserved.260 The faces of the mantled dancers, when preserved, do not match closely any of the facial types most characteristic of the Corinthian Hellenistic production (see pp. 157-168). This fact reinforces the conclusion that the mantled dancers were in the main copied from imported types, since there is no evidence that available local workshop materials were employed to construct them. Two additional mantled heads could have belonged to either standing figurines or dancers, but since they are not closely related to any of the figurines discussed here, they are treated among the isolated heads (see H204 and H206). 255 On the veiling of the face, see Troy, p. 103. 256 On the kerchief, see Troy, pp. 50-52; it is also worn by one of the Mahdia grotesques: Pfisterer-Haas 1994, pp. 484-486. 257 Winter, Typen II, p. 148, no. 7. 258 Morgantina, pp. 64, 187, nos. 460-462, pl. 91, with bibliography. 259 In lots 1953 and 6186. 260 Two other heads in Corinth (MF-4367, MF-185) wear the kerchief with eye slits, without a veil (Corinth XII, pp. 46- 47, nos. 285, 286, pl. 24, dated to the 3rd century B.C.). Since there are no mantle folds around the neck of either figurine, they probably were not mantled dancers.</page><page sequence="181">DISCUSSION 157 SEATED DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES (H175-H177) The seated draped female figurines of the Classical period included types that were easily recognizable as goddesses (e.g., C71), but the small group of Hellenistic seated draped figurines does not include any types of hieratic appearance, nor are any known in multiple impressions. Corinthian Hellenistic workshops appear to have emphasized standing types, apart from the representations of the seminude seated Aphrodite or nymphs discussed below (pp. 177-180). The best of the seated draped figurines in quality is H175, a fine Corinthian "Tanagra" type, of which a complete example is preserved in Athens (P1. 78).261 In the original type, a woman sits with her right foot propped on a rock, and her elbow rests on her raised knee. Her head, bent strongly to the right, rests on her clenched, mantle-wrapped hand. The pose could represent mourning, but the atmosphere of the figurine is reposeful or reflective rather than sad. The characteristic feature of the drapery is the series of tension folds across the torso from the right forearm to the left upper arm. This figurine is the most accurate rendition of a "Tanagra" type yet found in Corinth. The pottery context of H175 terminates at the middle of the 3rd century B.C. The head, round faced and youthful, would have been similar to H220, which originally could have belonged to a figure leaning on the hand, to judge from the diagonal break across the lower right side of the face and neck. Two fragments in lots 878 and 2249 show a slippered left foot propped on a rock. If these fragments belonged to seated figurines, they suggest that a type may have existed with the pose reversed, the left knee raised and supporting the left arm. These fragments are from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The two remaining seated figurines (H176 and H177) are more likely to represent mourners. The miniature H177 preserves a mantled figure seated dejectedly with shoulders hunched and right arm folded across her lap; the left hand grasps the drapery around her head and neck. The arrangement of the arms is like that of the "pudicitia" type (see p. 151). While the details of the face of H177 are unclear, the hunched shoulders and jutting head suggest an old woman, and it is tempting to see in this figurine a representation of the mourning Demeter, especially since human mourning figurines are generally represented beside a tomb.262 H176 could be a larger version of this type but is of poorer quality. ISOLATED FEMALE HEADS (H178-H248) A few of the isolated female heads discussed in this section are preserved with enough of the upper torso to show that they belonged to draped figurines, as in the case of H178; even a few folds around the base of the neck are sufficient, as in H245. In most cases, however, the original torso type is unknown, since heads were usually molded separately and were used with a variety of torso types, with coiffure or headdress altered as appropriate. Consequently, it must be kept in mind that these heads could have belonged to draped standing or seated figurines of the kind discussed in the foregoing section, representing goddesses or mortals, or to nude or semidraped figurines representing Aphrodite or the nymphs, as discussed below. In some cases, the coiffure or headdress assists in identification. A few heads can be linked with better-preserved figurines either found in excavation in Corinth or of reported Corinthian provenience, but this is no guarantee that his isolated heads from the Acrocorinth sanctuary originally belonged to identical torso types. 261 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4413; Winter, Typen II, p. 108, no. 5; Kleiner 1984, p. 170, pl. 36:a-c. 262 E.g., Winter, Typen II, p. 108, nos. 2, 3.</page><page sequence="182">158 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS While there are exceptions and variations, in the main the heads of Corinthian figurines of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. follow three largely coexisting stylistic trends. One trend, the more char- acteristically Corinthian, is ultimately derived from the strongly defined Classical head type dis- cussed above (pp. 39-40), although with "modernized" facial features. The face is a long oval with a tendency to flattened sides, resulting in a somewhat oblong shape; the jaw is full and rounded; the forehead is triangular with rounded sides, sometimes tending to a more ogival conformation. The eyes are relatively small, well-opened, fairly widely set, and level or only slightly downturned; at least the upper lid is clearly defined; the browridge is usually rounded in profile. The nose is relatively large and is usually close to the upper lip. The mouth is mobile, with well-arched lips, often parted but unsmiling or only faintly smiling. H180 is a good example of this trend. The second trend appears probably in the third quarter of the 4th century, perhaps arising from the same aesthetic movement that produced Attic "Tanagra" figurines. The facial features of these heads still have a good deal of character, but a softer, sweeter impression is conveyed through several means. The outlines of the face are softened, a more oval facial shape and a more delicate jaw being characteristic. The eyes are sometimes heavy lidded, conveying a languid, less alert air. An elaborate coiffure sometimes adds femininity to the head. Good examples of this trend are the votary with piglet HI and the head with melon coiffure H214. The third trend shows the greatest dependency on outside sources. These heads are very similar to the heads of 4th- and 3rd-century B.C. "Tanagra" figurines and may have been copied from that source. The heads are characterized by a round shape and delicate features; H220 is a good example. Others have round or heart-shaped, kittenish faces, often with only sketchily defined features and narrow, slanting eyes. H244 exemplifies this type. Since there are relatively few Corinthian versions of genuine "Tanagra" types among the draped figurines (see p. 142), it is likely that some of these "Tanagra" heads were attached to torsos of other types. The reader should keep in mind that defining these trends is merely a way of pointing to general stylistic movements. Not every head discussed below can be assigned definitively to one or another trend. Two heads (H178 and H179) can be connected with H57, a draped figurine perhaps representing Kore as a bride (see p. 133). H179 does not preserve any drapery, but the facial type seems to be similar to that of H57, and it is comparable in the arrangement of the hair in corkscrew curls framing the face and topped by a low polos. The workmanship is not comparable, however, suggesting that they were made in different workshops. The dull impression of the face combined with the sharp detailing of the added hair suggests the use of a worn mold or one with poor definition of forms. H178 wears a mantle, but it is not arranged in the same way as that of H57, the few folds above the break showing that it was loosely draped across the shoulders. Although the face is different in conformation from that of H57, it too is girlish, the youth of the subject being shown by the short, upturned nose and thin lips. The hair is not arranged in clearly defined corkscrew curls; nevertheless, the coroplast may have intended to represent such curls rather than long, loose hair, since the locks do not flow freely, as in renderings such as H181, but cling to the neck as separate strips of clay marked with horizontal slashes. The headdress seems to be a stephane rather than a polos, although it is not clear whether this distinction was deliberate or simply a failure to render the headdress properly at the sides and back. There is headdress, and the facial type, although H178 is more girlish. The six heads H180-H185 are sufficiently close to one another in scale, facial type, coiffure, fabric, and workmanship to suggest that they may have been made in the same workshop (Workshop F, see p. 345), although only two of them (H183 and H184) appear to be mechanically related. All members of this group wear the long, flowing hair characteristic of votaries (see pp. 117-118); the preserved shoulder of H181 shows that the figurine wears a chiton, as do some of the votaries. At size range 3-4, however, they are larger in scale than most of the votaries, being</page><page sequence="183">DISCUSSION 159 equal in size to H16, which also stands outside the common run of votaries in type. They also are less demure than most of the smaller votaries and perhaps for this reason sometimes seem to represent slightly older subjects. There is also a difference in the headdress, since two members of this group (H180 and H181) wear a pointed stephane, while the smaller votaries are bareheaded or wear a fillet. H182 is bareheaded, but a later generation wears the stephane (see catalogue). Moreover, H182 may be mechanically related to the head of the fine mantled figurine H85, which probably wears a small stephane, and on the basis of pose, costume, and coiffure is more likely a goddess or priestess than a votary. The wearing of a stephane in itself is not indicative of any particular status. Although originally a mark of divinity, by the Hellenistic period the stephane was also worn by mortal women, perhaps as a connection with the divine during rituals.263 To complicate the matter further, among Corinthian figurines, the long, flowing hair is not confined to votaries but is also worn by Aphrodite (see pp. 129-130). Probably this workshop prepared figurines of both votaries and goddesses, and while it is fair to say that the bareheaded and filleted heads of this group probably represent votaries, those wearing the stephane may not. It should also be mentioned that H185 may be mechanically related to H204, one of the heads with the curl-cluster coiffure, which seem to have served for a variety of types. Although mechanical relationship is not as good as workmanship as an indicator of workshop identity, since workshop materials appear to have been shared, the possibility should be kept in mind that this workshop may have produced a number of different but interrelated types. H183 is an interesting example of the mixing of male and female types. Long locks of hair were added at the front of this head but not at the back, revealing a short, masculine coiffure bound with a fillet. Either front and back molds that did not really match were used for convenience or the head type served for both male and female figurines, with coiffures altered as necessary. No examples of this head type have been preserved among the male figurines, but the practice of adapting workshop materials interchangeably regardless of gender can be observed also in the votary with piglet H1 and the corresponding youth H299 (see p. 119). The date of this group is easier to pin down than the subjects represented. Two heads, H183 and a head similar to H185 (see catalogue), were found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The more fully preserved H85 shows stylistic connections with sculpture of the middle to third quarter of the 4th century B.C. The heads alone, with their long, oval to oblong shape and relatively small eyes with well-defined lids, compare well with the head of Dionysos from the west pediment of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which is dated ca. 330 B.C.264 The coiffure of the Dionysos also matches that of H85. It seems fair to date this group of heads to the third quarter of the 4th century B.C. The particularly long and narrow faces of two heads (H186 and H187) are probably mechanical relatives, although the latter appears to have been distorted when the clay was removed from the mold. Both wear the stephane on long hair, although the locks framing the forehead are swept up and back rather than down. H187 is remarkable for the traces of bright pink paint on the flesh, gilding on the hair, and blue-green on the stephane, a reminder of just how brightly colored these figurines were in their original state. H186 was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which provides a terminus ante quem of the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. In several heads with long, full-jawed faces, the locks of hair tumble down in masses of short, tousled, overlapping waves or curls. The best of these heads is H188, a voluptuously beautiful 263 Troy, pp. 49-50. 264 Ridgway 1990, p. 21, with bibliography on p. 62, note 6, pi. 3.</page><page sequence="184">160 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS type that may represent a goddess. This identification is suggested first by the earrings the subject wears, which are unsuitable for the typically unadorned votary; in addition, the coiffure, although long, does not have the simple, streaming, uncut style of the votary but is more contrived. The vertical slashes on the upper molding of her high, poloslike stephane suggest the "crenellations" finishing the tall headdress of C 100, which probably represents a goddess. The notched stephane of C101 could have been intended to represent the same type of headdress. Whatever the correct identification of H188, however, it is clear that the figurine originally was mantled, since there are traces of folds at the neck. The hair was painted yellow, either to signify blondness or perhaps to serve as an underpaint for gilding (see pp. 13-14). H189 is poorly preserved but appears to have had a coiffure similar to H188; in this case, the stephane is decorated with a incised lotus-and-palmette pattern. The facial type clearly belongs in this group but has more deeply set eyes, which are better seen in H190. The triangular break at the base of the neck of k oH190 suggests that the head was set into a torso wearing a chiton or peplos with a V-shaped neckline. Both heads are of statuette scale. Another, fragmentary but still larger head of a statuette (H191) also shows eyes deeply set at the inner corners and a forehead that projects at the center in the manner of the pedimental heads from the Temple of Athena at Tegea.265 The simple coiffure ofH191, parted at the center and bound low around the cranium with a fillet, over which the locks of hair are wrapped and then rolled at the nape, has an Early Classical resonance, recalling the hair arrangement of a bronze head of a youth from the Athenian Akropolis.266 The combination of a 4th-century B.C. facial type with a much earlier hairstyle may indicate that this piece is a Classicizing work of the Hellenistic period. The very large scale would suit a late-3rd- or early-2nd-century B.C. date (see p. 257). The identification of the head is complicated by the use of a coiffure typical of male figures in earlier times, together with pink paint for the flesh, which is normal for female types and children, although it is sometimes found on smaller and less well crafted male figurines, particularly Classical reclining youths (see p. 14). Either the usually masculine coiffure was used for a female figure, as in the sculptured group of Orestes and Electra in Naples,267 or the head does represent a male and shows that pink paint was also considered appropriate for the flesh of youths in well-made figures at large scale. A head type that appears to have had some popularity in Corinth is represented by H192 with its mold siblings (see catalogue) and the smaller H193, all probably from the same workshop. There is some recollection in H192 of "Skopasian" style in the backward tilt of the head and the slight roll of flesh over the outer corner of the eye,268 but the facial structure is longer and narrower in the Corinthian tradition. This head type was identified in Corinth XII as male because of a superficial resemblance to the young Alexander (see catalogue).269 The strong jaw, lifted chin, and upcast gaze of H192 do contribute to this impression, but the presence in the Demeter sanctuary of female heads with long hair, stephanai, and similar facial types should fix the type as female.270 Although none of the heads of this type from Corinth is preserved with any part of the torso, fully preserved standing draped female figurines from Kerch have heads with a similar coiffure and headdress.271 The overlapping locks of hair of this group form curls rather than waves; in H193 the curls were rendered by attaching tubes of clay to the sides of the head and slashing them. The intention seems to have been to render corkscrew curls like those of H57 265 Cf. Stewart 1977, pl. 15. 266 See p. 40, note 120. 267 Conveniently, Bieber 1961, figs. 784, 785. 268 For the much more exaggerated heads from Tegea, which are sometimes attributed to Skopas, see Stewart 1977, pls. 13- 16; on the problems of this sculpture and its attribution, see Ridgway 1997, pp. 48-52. 269 The sculptural type in question has been discussed in relation to the Eubouleus from Eleusis: see Ridgway 1990, p. 117, with bibliography on p. 140, note 17. 270 See also Stroud 1965, p. 10, note 14. 271 Winter, Typen II, p. 50, no. 6.</page><page sequence="185">DISCUSSION 161 and H179. Moreover, the stephane of H193 is rather high and shaped like a polos, resembling somewhat the headdress of H179. In H192, the curls are more irregular, but the hair on the forehead at either side of the central part seems to form residual corkscrew curls. H194 is generally similar in coiffure and headdress, but the crude tooling of the hair creates some doubt about what was intended. The facial type is also different from the heads just discussed. The chin is smaller; moreover, the closely spaced eyes and the crowding of the features toward the center of the face recall a head type connected with articulated "dolls" (see C153). H194 does not seem to have any workshop connection with other heads wearing the stephane. It has a probable mold sibling in a head with a different coiffure (H230). H195 lacks the stephane, but the overlapping arrangement of rough curls at the sides of the head recalls the coiffure ofH193. Two heads (H196 and H197) that are similar to one another in fabric and especially workmanship, and probably were mold siblings, could be by the same hand. The coiffures have been altered, in H197 to represent a girl in a decorated stephane resembling the headdress of H178, and in H196 to show long hair simply bound with a fillet like that of H20. Whether the torso types were correspondingly different is unknown, but the two heads are nevertheless evidence for the alteration of types within a workshop. Although the heads are large in scale, the facial features were crudely retouched, obscuring their mold history. If their size points to an early stage of any of the votary mold series, there must have been other, more carefully prepared materials in use i better workshops. The combination of large scale and crude retouch is known in other Early Hellenistic head types as well (see H225-H228). H198 shows an unadorned coiffure like that of H184; it is smaller than H196 and H197 but resembles them somewhat in fabric and workmanship, although less crudely retouched. The heads that will now be discussed have elaborate coiffures, three of which are worn by the Muses on the Mantineia base.272 In one coiffure, the hair is drawn up loosely from the temples and the nape to be gathered into a cluster of curls at the top of the cranium, in a version of the so-called bowknot coiffure.273 In the second coiffure, the hair is gathered somewhat further back, leaving room for decorative bands to be wrapped around the head. The third is the aptly named melon coiffure, in which the hair was divided into sections of twisted locks and finished with a surrounding plait, or a bun or cluster of curls at the back. For our purposes, the Mantineia base, a work of more modest quality in its own realm than the figurines are in theirs, is important only for establishing the contemporaneity of these fashions in hair arranging. No longer convincingly connected with Praxiteles, the Mantineia base is now better understood as a pastiche of workshop types rather than an independent creation.274 A date ca. 330-320 B.C. seems most likely.275 A better stylistic parallel for the facial type can be found in the head of Eros-Thanatos on the sculptured column drum from the Artemision at Ephesos, dated ca. 320/310 B.C.276 The Eros, whose facial structure can be compared with that of H201, also wears his hair pulled up from the nape to the top of the head. The heads of this group reflect the second stylistic trend mentioned above (p. 158), conveying a softer, more feminine impression than those previously discussed. The means by which this impression is achieved include a rounder face shape with a more delicate jaw and sometimes dreamy, heavy-lidded eyes, as well as the use of elaborate, upswept coiffures. Heads wearing the cluster of curls (H199-H206) show two versions of this coiffure, one in which the locks of hair are pulled up tightly, as in H199, and the other in which the arrangement is looser, as in H201. 272 See the detailed photos in Troy, pl. LIX. 273 The variants of this coiffure and examples of its use in male and female sculptural and coroplastic types are discussed in Troy, pp. 42-44. 274 Linfert-Reich 1971, pp. 32-42. 275 Apart from considerations of style and workmanship, the use of a lute by one of the Muses may hold the date of the relief to the period of or after the conquests of Alexander the Great, when this instrument was introduced to Greece: Maas and Snyder 1989, p. 185. 276 Riigler 1988, pp. 86, 105-107, pl. 27:1, 2.</page><page sequence="186">162 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS There is probably no real difference between the two, the original version being the tighter one, and the fuller version arising from the addition of locks of hair when the head was retouched. The curls seem not to have been actually knotted but gathered and tied together and allowed to fall softly to either side. It should be mentioned that these falling locks of hair usually are rendered in the form of corkscrew curls, but it is unclear whether or not this resemblance to the corkscrew-curl coiffure discussed above (p. 133) is fortuitous. Whatever the interpretation, these heads are lovely. H199, the largest of the group, approaches statuette scale and is of a fine, pale, and well-polished fabric.277 The hair was carefully worked to define the curling locks, and the ears are shown in much greater detail than is usual in the figurines. Perhaps because the polishing process dulled the definition of the features, the face was carefully tooled to open the lips and undercut the upper eyelids. Since most of this detail would have been lost after the slip and paint were applied, one must assume that this figurine was made by a craftsman who took pride in the quality of his work. H202 is made of the same fine, polished fabric, but the facial features have not been tooled and are consequently less well defined than the hair. The eyes and mouth ofH201 are tooled, although not as carefully, and the fabric is not quite as fine. The tooling of the faces unfortunately obscures mechanical relationships, but the similarities of fabric and workmanship seem great enough to suggest that H199, H201, and H202 probably were made in the same workshop (Workshop G, see p. 345), although not by the same hand. To these should probably be added H203 and H204. The smaller, later versions H200, H205, and H206 are handled quite differently and probably were made elsewhere in Corinth. Of these, perhaps only H205 was mechanically related to one of the larger heads.278 Two other heads (H214 and H215) are also dreamily pretty, but their faces are differently structured, with sloping profiles. Heads of this type were used with a variety of torsos. H204 wears the mantle over the head and therefore belonged to either a standing mantled figurine or perhaps a mantled dancer. Since H203 shows a fold at the base of the neck, it too would have belonged to a mantled figurine but one with a bare head. At the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos, a strikingly similar head type appears on a mantled figurine similar to H104.279 A figurine of Corinthian provenience in Berlin, representing a woman holding a duck, has a head very like H203, but the mantle is arranged around the hips rather than the neck.280 A non-Corinthian version of the mantled type H88 also wears this coiffure.281 Heads with the curl-cluster coiffure are also found in Corinthian ephedrismos groups, such as one in Boston282 and another in Berlin.283 A Corinthian seated Aphrodite with Eros in Paris also has such a head.284 Clearly, one cannot determine the subjects of these figurines on the basis of the heads alone. In sculpture, a similar head type was used for Hygieia on a votive relief in Paris;285 at monumental scale, such a coiffure, although more complex, is worn by the Apollo from Halikarnassos.286 The chronology of these heads is firmly fixed in the 4th century B.C. Apart from the parallels with the Mantineia base, H204 and H206 are from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.c.; in addition, H202 was found in a context dated by 4th-century B.C. pottery. This head type is so strongly associated with Corinthian figurines that the archetype of a closely similar mold from Smyrna 277 See the color illustration in Coroplast's Art, p. 18, color pl. 1. 278 A possibly Corinthian head from the Athenian Agora, T-3696, also wears the curl-cluster coiffure. 279 Knossos, p. 70, nos. 73-75, pls. 42-43. 280 See p. 148, note 208. 281 Winter, Typen II, p. 8, no. 4. 282 Coroplast's Art, pp. 128-129, no. 20. 283 KInigliche Museen, p. 16, pls.

Two of these heads, H209 and H210, have faces connected in type to the heads with curl-cluster coiffure discussed above, although there does not appear to be a mechanical or even a workshop relationship. Both heads wear a turban, in which wide, overlapping bands of cloth enclose most of the hair; in H210 a fringe of curls is allowed to escape around the forehead.288 These heads probably date to the same time as the heads with curl-cluster coiffure and may have been used in the same ways. The facial type of H207, although partly obscured by the cracking of the surface, resembles that of HI 83, a head with long, streaming hair, probably a votary. The coiffure ofH207, however, is distinctive. A wide fillet, incised with a running spiral, is wrapped around the hair between the forehead and a cluster of curls on top of the head; the fillet pushes the hair forward into a sort of pompadour around the forehead. This response of the locks of hair to the pressure of the band is nicely observed, and since it has not been obscured by successive generations or retouch, it is likely that the head is close to its archetype. The coiffure of the seated Muse on the Mantineia base is similar but is more schematic.289 The same coiffure on a smaller head (H208) also is more schematic and has lost the naturalistic touch. The face in this case is rather flat, perhaps because of a molding distortion. A similar facial flatness, unusual in Corinthian heads, is also found in a Corinthian standing girl in New York.290 The well-made H211 has a more Classical look, although the rounded browridge and high, ogival forehead are signs of a Hellenistic date. The face is not too far from the hydriaphoros C60, although H211 is softer in expression and more rounded in the outline of the cheeks and jaw. The Classical appearance is largely due to the coiffure, which is arranged in the Knidian fashion in front, swept down to the ears from a central part.291 The headdress consists of the typical Classical sakkos, which catches the mass of hair above the nape in a snood and is then folded into bands and wrapped over the top of the head. The curls escaping from the snood are arranged in a neat clump rather than a loose cluster. The smaller head H212 is similar in facial type and also shows full cheeks and a rounded jaw; in this case, all the hair in back is wrapped in a sakkos, the loose cloth allowed to hang in the back in a soft fold over the cranium. A fold at the neck indicates that this figurine originally was mantled. In a possible earlier generation of H212 from Epidauros (see catalogue), the loose cloth at the cranium is replaced by a loose cluster of curls emerging from a sphendone, which was perhaps the original composition. In scale and treatment of the locks of hair in front, the Epidaurian head corresponds with H211. The three heads may have been made in the same workshop. In two heads (H213 and H215), the coiffure is wrapped in a narrow sphendone tied at the top of the head in a soft bowknot. This, too, is a typically Classical headdress, known especially in the articulated "dolls" and related heads (e.g., C125, C130, and C131). The hair ofH213, moreover, is arranged in the Knidian manner in front, yet the face is more Hellenistic than Classical. A melting look is conveyed by the thrown-back pose of the head, the narrow, half-closed eyes, and the parted lips. This head is one of the few in which the blurring of the facial features seems to be a deliberate sfumato rather than a dull impression from a worn or poorly made mold. The freshness of the mold is indicated by the crisply waved locks of hair in front, which were rendered in the mold and were not retouched. This well-made head bears some resemblance, in the facial shape, 287 Louvre III, p. 188, no. D1376, pl. 264:g-i, dated to the 3rd century B.C. 288 For a similar turban worn by a "Tanagra" figurine, see Higgins 1986, p. 130, fig. 155 (in London). 289 See the detailed photo in Troy, pl. LIX:c. The coiffure here is not entirely consistent, since the hair behind the band is divided into narrow melon sections. 290 Coroplast's Art, p. 125, no. 18. 291 On the Knidian coiffure, see Troy, pp. 37-38.</page><page sequence="188">164 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS the well-proportioned and placed features, and the long, narrow eyes, to the late-4th-century B.C. sculptured head from Tegea called the "Hygieia."292 Since the sculpture also wears a cluster of curls at the back of the head, fastened with narrow bands, it is conceivable that there is some connection through workshop materials between it and the figurine type. In H215, the sphendone and a cluster of curls at the back were superimposed on a head originally designed with a melon coiffure. This manner of dressing the hair, dividing and twisting the locks into sections recalling the rind of a grooved melon, was very popular during the Hellenistic period and is frequently found in representations of young women and children. Among the Acrocorinth figurines, it is also found on a child (H342) and an articulated "doll" (C136). Variations occur in the number and thickness of sections, in the way the coiffure is finished with plaits, a bun, or curls, and in the overall shape and volume of the design.293 While the coroplasts of some centers show a preference for specific variations of the melon coiffure, and a chronological pattern emerges from their efforts, Corinthian coroplasts adopted no particularly consistent version of the coiffure. Further, they do not always seem to have understood it very well, sometimes adding the more typically Corinthian cluster of curls to a melon coiffure already augmented with plaits; the bun at the back of the head that is characteristic of the melon coiffure elsewhere does not appear in these Corinthian heads. The facial types of heads with the melon coiffure also vary greatly, some being local, others apparently borrowed from outside sources. H215 is probably a mold sibling of H214, which also shows the curl-cluster finish at the back but has a plait around the cranium instead of a sphendone. Both heads have a heavy-lidded, dreamy look, and while their faces are quite different from that of H213, the iconographic intention seems to have been the same. Thick eyelids could result from the use of worn molds, in the absence of the retouch necessary to sharpen details (as in the case of H234), but in these faces the heavy lids appear to be intentional. H216 may have been similar in facial type, but its poor preservation prevents accurate comparison. It is notable for the unusual fullness and volume of the melon coiffure. Four heads wearing the melon coiffure (H217-H220) show faces of rounder shape; the short, rather wide noses and small mouths contribute to the youthful look of these heads. They represent the third trend in the style of Early Hellenistic Corinthian heads. H217 and H218 may be mechanically related, but the cluster of curls and earrings added to the latter change its appearance entirely. H219, with both a plait and a cluster of curls on the cranium elaborating the melon coiffure, has a possible mechanical relative in Epidauros (see catalogue) with a plait alone. H220 is broken diagonally across the right side in such a way as to suggest that the head originally leaned on the hand of a seated figurine of "Tanagra" style similar to H175 (see p. 157). Heads with round, short-nosed faces and wearing the melon coiffure must be of Athenian inspiration and are sometimes found on figurines of"Tanagra" type.294 It is possible, therefore, that H217-H220 all originally belonged to "Tanagra" torsos, keeping in mind that separately made heads could have been used with any torso type. The best of these heads in quality, H220, was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. This evidence and the connection with "Tanagra" types should place the origin of this head type within the second half of the 4th century B.C. These heads should be distinguished from another "Tanagra" head type further from Corinthian style, in which the faces 292 Conveniently, Lullies and Hirmer 1960, pl. 205; for side and rear views, see Picard 1954, pp. 201-202, figs. 89, 90; Ridgway 1997, p. 54, with bibliography on pp. 73-74, note 80. The hair of two small marble heads of uncertain date in the Corinth collection (S-2124 and S-2523) is arranged in a cluster of curls on top of the cranium. For another of Hellenistic date, see Sturgeon 1998a, p. 9, fig. 20 (S-2389). 293 On the variations and their possible chronological im- plications, see Troy, pp. 38-39; Morgantina, pp. 66-67; on the coiffure in general, Kleiner 1984, p. 15. 294 E.g., Coroplast's Art, p. 110, no. 3 (in Boston); for a typical head of this type from a dated Athenian context, see S.

A few such heads (H243-H245) have been found at the Acrocorinth sanctuary and are discussed below (pp. 168-169). Three small heads wearing the melon coiffure are unrelated to other heads or to one another. H221 has a long, narrow face recalling the hydriaphoroi of Classical type (e.g., C57), but the features are more delicate, and the sloping forehead and arched nose evoke such Hellenistic renderings as the head of the votary with piglet H1. The coiffure has relatively few, but prominent sections, without an encircling plait; this version is thought to be a relatively early form of the melon style.295 In this example, the coiffure is finished with a cluster of curls at the nape rather than at the cranium, which is fairly uncommon. H222 and H223 show the degeneration of the melon coiffure into a mass of hair roughly marked with slashes. H223 is noteworthy for the possibility of establishing a workshop link (Workshop J, see p. 346) with two figurines of different types, the standing girl H44 and the hydriaphoros H50. The three pieces are connected by their notably hard, fine, and pale-colored fabric; the hair of both H50 and H223 is painted a bright yellow, perhaps indicating that gilding was employed (see pp. 13-14). Yet for all the excellence of the material, the workmanship in all three figurines is indifferent. H44 and H223 are very dull impressions, perhaps from worn molds, but the artisans did not have the skill to retouch them properly, leaving the face of H223 nearly a blank surface and slashing the hair hideously. The pottery context of H44 falls in the middle to second half of the 3rd century B.C., a date that seems fair for these exhausted figurine types, made in a workshop with access to good material but without the skill to use it to best effect. The melon sections of hair are tooled so sketchily on H224 that the coiffure is barely recognizable. The face is unparalleled among the female heads, and since it is less feminine in appearance than the other heads wearing the melon coiffure, it is possible that the hair of a male head was retouched to provide a head for a female figurine. This workshop practice is documented in H183 (see p. 159). Four larger heads (H225-H228), in size ranges 3-4, are related to one another in facial type and in their crude retouch; three of this group wear the melon coiffure. The largest of these and the best in fabric is H225. This head wears a melon coiffure, originally gilded, with deep, well- rounded sections, a variant thought to be relatively early in the use of this hairstyle and to indicate a late-4th-century B.C. date.296 This head was found with late-4th-century B.C. pottery. H226 ap- pears to be a later generation in a much poorer fabric, preserving some of the crude facial retouch ofH225 in the mold but wearing a simple coiffure with straight locks of hair combed down from a central part. Such straight hair is generally thought to signal a 3rd-century B.C. date,297 suggesting that this mold series could have remained in use for some time without significant loss of size or detail. One member of this group (H227) has a possible later generation in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building (see catalogue), which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.c.; therefore, H227 should date to the 4th century B.C. It is poorly fired and shows a combination of large size and crude retouch recalling the group H196-H198 discussed above (p. 161). H227 has a rudimentary cluster of curls added to the melon coiffure. A head of similar type appears on the running girl of a better-made Corinthian ephedrismos group in Amsterdam.298 H228 is also large in scale and crude in retouch. Both a cluster of curls and plaits were added to the melon coiffure, showing a fundamental misunderstanding of this hair arrangement. While the differences in facial features probably preclude a mechanical relationship with this group, the similarities in scale and technical approach could indicate a workshop connection. H228 also has a mechanical relative in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building (see catalogue), which confirms its 4th-century B.C. date. Since this relative preserves a few folds draped closely around the neck, we 295 Troy, p. 38, melon coiffure with deep waves. 296 Troy, p. 3 8. 297 Cf.

A head similar to H228 in type and retouch of the hair appears on a figurine of reported Corinthian provenience in Berlin, portraying a young woman in a chiton and mantle, with her foot propped on a rock.299 Two heads (H229 and H230) show a coiffure in which only the hair in front is gathered up into a cluster of curls, the remaining locks falling to the shoulders. This coiffure is known in the Corinth collection in two figurines of a dancing girl wearing a peplos.300 No fragments of this dancing torso have been recognized among the Acrocorinth sanctuary finds, but it is likely that these heads do represent youthful subjects, since this coiffure is also found in representations of children, such as H345. Perhaps this coiffure is connected with the Classical fashion, also associated with youth, in which the hair is pulled back from the forehead in a plait. The face of H229 was distorted in molding so that the jaw is unusually heavy and prominent, but H230 is a probable mold sibling of a head type with long hair and a stephane (H194). Whatever the original torso types of H229 and H230, they probably represented girls or young women. The last group of heads with elaborate coiffures to be discussed shows some form of hair knot on top of the cranium. Projecting hair knots of a different sort were very common in Classical figurines, particularly on the heads of articulated "dolls" and heads related to them. In those figurines, the projections may have been apotropaic (see p. 171), but the lack of a shared coiffure type among the Hellenistic heads suggests that here the knots are merely decorative. Each of these heads exhibits a different facial type. A head very close in both face and coiffure to H231 is known in a representation of a flying Nike in Berlin301 and in a semidraped Aphrodite with Eros of reported Corinthian provenience.302 Two torso fragments from the Acrocorinth sanctuary (H297 and H298 [see p. 184]) show an overfold hem flaring with movement like that of the Berlin Nike and may belong to similar types. The good quality of H231, and the Classical look imparted by the well-opened eyes with clearly defined lids and the coiffure, which is parted at the center and swept to the sides in the Knidian manner, point to a 4th-century B.C. date. The fresh modeling of the locks of hair in front, which were rendered in the mold, suggests that this figurine is not far from its archetype. H232, by contrast, has a purely Hellenistic face, with widely set, downturned eyes having puffy lower lids and giving the impression that the gaze is cast upward. The distinctive features of this earthy face are a very large and wide nose, and a particularly wide and fleshy mouth. To judge from the break, the head seems originally to have been turned sharply to the right, and the figure may have been in motion or at least in a restless pose. Since there are remains of folds around the neck, the torso must have been mantled. The locks of hair in front, rendered in the mold, are gathered into a bowknot faintly suggesting volutes, although it is not the elaborate volute knot known in Asiatic figurines.303 The finishing touch at the back is an added cluster of curls. With two probable mold siblings from the Acrocorinth sanctuary (see catalogue), this head seems to have belonged to a fairly popular type. The earthiness of the facial type is not very different from the more static Classical heads C134 and C135, but better definition of the features, more skillfully rendered hair, and a twisted pose have given this head much greater refinement. In H233, the coroplast added a flaring lampadion knot at the top to the skimpy, caplike waves of the original coiffure. The lampadion knot is unusual in Corinthian figurines, although it appears on a figurine in Berlin that is probably Corinthian,304 wearing a chiton and mantle 299 Kiinigliche Museen, p. 20, pl. XXV 300 MF-1018, MF-1019 (Corinth XII, pp. 43-44, no. 248, pl. 21). 301 Knoblauch 1939, cols. 437-438, 445, figs. 28, 29. This figurine probably is Corinthian; its early attribution to Athens predates significant publication of Corinthian figurines. It is to be noted that the workmanship is compared by Knoblauch to a kalathiskos dancer in Berlin (see p. 59, note 237), which should also be Corinthian. 302 Winter, Typen II, p. 94, no. 2. 303 On this form of bowknot, see Troy, p. 43; cf. p. 131, no. 214, pl. XLVI. 304 Winter, Typen II, p. 60, no. 7.</page><page sequence="191">DISCUSSION 167 arranged somewhat like the costume of H131. The triangular shape of the break in front of H233 probably reflects the V-shaped neckline of a chiton or peplos. This head is from a pottery context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C. The coiffure of the last member of this disparate group (H234) shows the rough outlines of a bowknot at the top and a rough plait around the cranium. The head is poorly made; the eyelids are nearly closed, probably because the mold was badly worn, but the coroplast did not retouch them. The head is dated not later than the beginning ofrr the 3rd century B.. by its context, the construc- tion fill of the Trapezoidal Building, and a 4th-century B.C. date is confirmed by a connection with the votary with piglet H1. Although the facial types are entirely different, the two heads are similar in structure; both are unusually deep in profile and show arched noses, sloping foreheads, and receding chins. It is possible that some shared workshop material underlies both types, although there is nothing to connect them more closely, iconographically, stylistically, or technically. Such a limited connection, but one that can hardly be accidental, confirms the impression that Corin- thian workshop connections were very complex, because of the sharing, exchanging, or copying of materials or their purchase from common sources (see p. 123). The face of H234 is more similar, in the conformation of the features as well as the sloping profile, to the popular head type of the 4th-century B.C. mantled figure H102, and, in this case, a mechanical relationship is possible. Four heads, also with varying facial types, share a style of hairdressing that has Classical roots. The locks of hair are swept away from a central part, in the Knidian fashion, in H235 and H236. In H237, the locks spring up directly from the forehead, framing it in an unparted pompadour. In H238, the coroplast has taken the trouble to show that this part of the hair is wrapped around to the back of the head. The rest of the locks of hair are either gathered at the nape or fall to the shoulders. The earthy facial features of this head are not unlike those of H232. In more fully preserved figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, similar coiffures are found in the Late Classical dancer C282 and in the fine, standing draped female figurine H85. More roughly rendered, this coiffure is found on heads that probably represent votaries, for example, C154. In sculpture, it is worn by both male and female deities, particularly Dionysos305 and Demeter.306 H235 has a very slight "Skopasian" flavor, in the short, wide facial shape and rectangular forehead with an ogival point at the hair parting. The same combination can be found in the Dresden maenad, which is sometimes connected with Skopas,307 although the subject of that sculpture requires an intensity of expression not found in the quieter figurine. The remains of a fold around the neck indicate that H235 originally belonged to a mantled figurine. The facial features are somewhat more delicate than in most of the heads from the Acrocorinth sanctuary. The very crisp, parallel waves at the front of the coiffure, not retouched, suggest a fresh mold and a nearness to the archetype; they also suggest that the source may have been a bronze statuette. H236 wears a similar coiffiure, rendered with less clarity and freshness, to which a stephane was added. The facial features show a somewhat similar conformation and delicacy, although with less sweetness, and the cheeks are fuller. The hair of H237 is rendered as in H235 in crisp, parallel waves, although the locks of hair are arranged differently. In this case, one must also consider the possibility of a metallic source. In spite of the low-bridged, upturned nose, which is unusual among Corinthian figurines, the long, straight-sided, full-jawed face is of recognizably local type, not too far from H186. The clearly marked browridge, well-opened eyes with both lids defined, and serene expression give H237 a Classical air. Its style belongs to the 4th century B.C., perhaps the second quarter. Since 305 E.g., the head of Dionysos from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi: Ridgway 1990, p. 21, with bibliography on p. 62, note 3, pl. 3. 306 E.g., the Demeter of Knidos: conveniently, Lullies and Hirmer 1960, pl. 225. 307 Stewart 1977, pp. 91-93, 140-141, pl. 32:d; on the attribution, see Ridgway 1997, pp. 255-257, with bibliography on p. 278, note 55.</page><page sequence="192">168 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS the arrangement of the hair in front is not characteristic of any of the standard feminine coiffures, and the face itself is not particularly feminine, it is conceivable that the head represents Dionysos rather than a woman or goddess. The remaining head in this group (H238) is of lesser technical quality. Although the distorted, flattened nose coarsens its appearance, a certain fleshiness of the lower face seems to be one of its inherent traits. There is some stylistic connection in the earthiness of the face with the head of the Late Classical dancer C282 and the imported head 14, which is probably Argive. In the realm of sculpture, the head of the west akroterion of the Temple of Asklepios at Epidauros affords a parallel.308 Two possible mold siblings of H238 from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building (see catalogue) provide a terminus ante quem for the type at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. In four heads (H239-H242), the hair is piled into a rounded peak and entirely hidden in a sakkos. In better-preserved figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, headdresses of this kind are found on mantled figurines (e.g., Hill) and mantled dancers (e.g., H154). The import 110, which is probably Argive, wears this headdress, is swathed in a mantle, and carries a ball. In an ephedrismos group in Berlin that is probably Corinthian, one of the figures wears a curl-cluster coiffure and the other, a sakkos.309 A similar headdress, completely covering the hair, also appears on a figurine in Paris,310 which is costumed in a mantle with a heavy drapery fall at the side like that of H65 and could represent a goddess. There does not appear to be any pattern of types calling for the concealing of the hair, although when mantled brides are represented in vase painting, their hair is covered in this way beneath the mantle.311 The ball carried by the Argive 110 also points to a bridal interpretation. This fashion of dressing the hair originally may have had some specific function on particular figurine types but may have spread to others through the common workshop practice of mixing and exchanging heads and torsos. The facial types connected with this headdress are varied. H239 resembles H238 in facial type, repeating its large, earthy features, although no mechanical relationship is discernible. In H240, the border of the headdress around the forehead must originally have been painted, but even without this detail, the identification of the headdress is secure because of the loose fold of cloth shown at the back of the head. The face, on the other hand, is detailed and expressive, with deeply set eyes and parted lips. By contrast, H242 does include the border of the sakkos, but the face is almost as undefined and inexpressive as that of the dancer H154. Enough of the strong and broad neck of this figurine is preserved, however, to show that the woman was not closely wrapped in a mantle and is not likely to have been a dancer, at least of the mantled type. In addition, the unusual depth of the neck in back indicates a quiet pose. Heads of this type were made at the Potters' Quarter (see catalogue), providing a terminus ante quem in the 320s B.C., when these workshops were destroyed. The headdress of H241 is distorted but is nevertheless easily identified. Like H240, the face is expressive and shadowed. The last group of heads to be discussed in this section consists of types that are not character- istic of the Corinthian production, although on the basis of fabric and workmanship, they should probably be assigned to local workshops. Four of the six heads in this group were copied from readily identifiable foreign sources. H243-H245 must be copies of "Tanagra" figurines. The modeling ofH245 is so poorly defined that it may have been made in a mold taken directly from a "Tanagra" figurine and not retouched. H243 and H244 show a degree of definition similar to the ordinary run of "Tanagra" figurines and therefore could have been made in imported Attic 308 Yalouris 1992, pp. 32-33, no. 27, pls. 30, 31. 309 Ko'nigliche Museen, p. 16, pls.

All three show the narrow-eyed, short-nosed, smiling, rather characterless kittenish faces typical of "Tanagra" figurines of the later 3rd century B.c.312 H244 and H245 show variations on the melon coiffure not seen in the more typically Corinthian heads, being fin- ished with a small plaited circlet on the cranium or a small bun. H245 wears the mantle draped closely around the neck. These heads, together with the less exaggerated H217-H220, represent the third stylistic trend in Early Hellenistic Corinthian heads, as described above (p. 158). H246, with her serious, more Peloponnesian face and long locks of hair clinging close to the head and neck, must be a copy of an Argive type, such as the imported 19. Characteristic of the Argive retouch of this coiffure are the diagonal, downward strokes on the locks of hair framing the sides of the face and the neck. Since similar strokes in the hair of H246 were rendered in the mold rather than by hand, it would appear that this figurine was made in a mold taken directly from an imported Argive figurine. The two remaining heads are not characteristically Corinthian in facial type, but their sources are not clear. H247 has deeply set eyes, a thin nose, and pursed lips. The figurine seems to have been burned, obscuring the original appearance of the fabric, but the workmanship is sufficiently like that of Corinthian figurines to include it with the local products. H248 has asymmetrical features and is flattened at the right side, as if originally attached to something; perhaps it was part of a relief. The deeply shadowed eyes and sense of suppressed emotion suggest a 4th-century B.C. date. Although the detail in the hair is somewhat incoherent, it was probably very fine in the archetype, suggesting a source in metal relief (see p. 81), possibly Attic. NUDE AND SEMIDRAPED APHRODITE, LEDA, MAENAD(?), NYMPHS, AND RELATED HEADS (H249-H286) Allusions to Aphrodite in the Classical figurines from the Demeter sanctuary have been mentioned above (p. 43). In addition, the Corinthian Early Hellenistic repertoire of draped female figurines includes some that have been tentatively identified as Aphrodite (pp. 135-136, 138-139, 147, 148). In this section are discussed other figurines, nude or semidraped, some of which are clearly within the iconographical parameters set for Aphrodite in the 4th century B.C. and later. While it is sometimes difficult to distinguish representations of nude mortal women at their toilette from "genuine" representations of Aphrodite, in the context of a sanctuary such distinctions may be unnecessary. Whether a figurine depicted a nude woman, a courtesan, or Aphrodite, the point must have been to evoke a sense of Aphrodite for the worshiper and to allow the mortal to identify with the deity. As mentioned above (p. 24), the very difficulty of distinguishing deity from mortal in these votive gifts is itself the essence of the relationship between the two. In any case, the presence of Aphrodite in the sanctuary can be felt strongly. The honoring of this goddess in the context of a shrine of Demeter and Kore need not be surprising. If it is true, as suggested above, that some of the figurines found in this shrine were offered for the purpose of ensuring fruitful marriage and protecting children, Aphrodite finds a comfortable niche as a patroness of marriage and a guardian of children, in which roles she is sometimes known.313 While Aphrodite would seem to be diametrically opposed in meaning to Demeter and Kore, affinities as'well as differences among these goddesses have been uncovered through structural analysis.314 Of all the major goddesses, Aphrodite and Demeter are the only two who are loving mothers in myth, struggling to safeguard their children. Paralleling Demeter's efforts 312 E.g., in London, Higgins 1986, p. 144, fig. 174. 313 The sources for these roles are collected and discussed in Farnell, Cults II, pp. 655-657; on Aphrodite as kourotrophos, see also p. 71. 314 Summarized by Friedrich 1978, pp. 206-210.</page><page sequence="194">170 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS to reclaim her daughter from the Underworld are the activities of Aphrodite recounted in the Iliad (5.311-318) to protect her son Aeneas. Aphrodite also appears in art as an affectionate mother, sometimes fondling the young Eros or pressing him to her side, as in a Corinthian figurine in Athens (P1. 78).315 Aphrodite's place at the Demeter sanctuary could have been strengthened by her position as the protectress of the city of Corinth as a whole;316 the shrine on the summit of Acrocorinth was dedicated to Aphrodite Ourania; that cult title emphasizes her creation from the genitals of Ouranos and thus her function as a fertility deity. Presumably, it is this dual aspect of protectress of the inhabitants of Corinth and patroness of fertility that assured her role as a "visiting" deity at the shrine of Demeter and Kore.317 The connection may have been strengthened by Demeter's parallel role elsewhere in Greece as protectress of the state.318 Another factor contributing to Aphrodite's strong presence at the Demeter sanctuary in the Hellenistic period could have been the Macedonian occupation of Acrocorinth beginning in 338 B.c., which perhaps restricted access to the shrines there,319 although there are indications of her worship beside Demeter and Kore earlier (see pp. 43, 71, and discussion of "dolls," pp. 50, 171-172). Perhaps it is significant that the most easily identifiable representations of Aphrodite found at the Demeter sanctuary (e.g., H249) do belong to the later 4th and 3rd centuries. The most likely conclusion is that necessity increased the worship of Aphrodite at a sanctuary in which she was already honored. Another link between Aphrodite and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore is Aphrodite's worship alongside Persephone at Lokroi; there the two goddesses appear to have been so closely linked that only careful analysis has enabled the separation of their distinctive cultic personalities in the votive offerings.320 Closer to Corinth, Pausanias (2.36.7-37.2) mentions the presence of a statue of Aphrodite in the sacred grove at Lerna, together with several statues of Demeter and Dionysos, suggesting that all three deities were honored there. Moreover, Aphrodite and Persephone are linked in myth, in their competition for the child Adonis, who finally divided his time between them at the behest of Zeus in a variation of the Demeter-Kore-Hades myth (Apollodoros 3.14.4). Taking into account the similarities and differences among these goddesses, and some apparent ambivalence in dealing with the different aspects of fertility embodied in their worship, it may be possible to see in the inclusion of Aphrodite in the cult of Demeter and Kore an attempt to mediate between the cults of these deities, to overcome the cultural tendency to separate sexuality from maternity321 by suggesting that pleasure and the fulfillment of procreative duties are not necessarily mutually exclusive322 and that girls, first identified with Kore, could ultimately be identified with Demeter through the intervention of Aphrodite. This goddess clearly could have played a role in one of the apparent functions of this cult, the acknowledging and institutionalizing of emerging sexuality, by channeling instinct into marriage and childbearing. Perhaps the inclusion of Aphrodite in this cult of Demeter and Kore also moderated the socially and religiously sanctioned but extrafamilial eroticism in Aphrodite's principal Corinthian cult. 315 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160; see p. 130, note 88. The maternal aspect of Aphrodite is also stressed in her depiction on the Parthenon frieze: Mark 1984, pp. 295-301. 316 On the worship of Aphrodite in Corinth, see C. K.

This category of figurines is discussed fully above, in terms of technique, typology, and style (pp. 48-53); they are reintroduced here for their possible connection with Aphrodite. The previously published interpretations of "dolls" have been outlined above (pp. 49-50); it is important to keep in mind that the dedication of figurines was largely a local matter, the types taking on the coloration of the place of dedication rather than having a single universal meaning. "Dolls" of the Archaic and Classical periods, which survived into Hellenistic times, are the only examples of full female nudity among the figurines from the sanctuary.323 Representations of Aphrodite are semidraped, the only fully nude example being H266, which appears to have been constructed from a "doll's" torso. The same technique probably was used for the nude maenad(?) H267. The "dolls," particularly in the 4th century B.C., sometimes wear elaborate coiffures or headdresses in which the hair is twisted either into a single upright peak or knot from the top or back of the head or into a pair of such peaks, which form a double horn or boatlike crescent in the profile view of the head. Dorothy B. Thompson, who identified the seated "dolls" from Troy as hierodouloi,324 saw single hair peaks as apotropaic, offering protection to the courtesans who wore them.325 Sexual symbolism can be both apotropaic and, as Zeitlin has suggested, "prostropaic," not turning away evil but gathering up its forces to stimulate fertility.326 Using either interpretation, the depiction of these coiffures on the Corinthian "dolls" can perhaps be related to the use of hierodouloi in the Corinthian cult of Aphrodite, a ritual custom adopted in a modified form from the Phoenician cult of Astarte.327 If the single hair peak is protective by virtue of its phallic shape,328 the double peak may serve the same function by signifying the female genitalia. In a Sumerian poem celebrating the sacred marriage of Inanna and Dumuzi, Inanna compares her vulva to a horn, the Boat of Heaven, and the crescent moon,329 that is, the shapes embodied in the "dolls' " coiffures. Presumably, in the poem these forms suggested the sexuality of Inanna to the listener and therefore her ability to bring fertility and prosperity, just as the shape of the "dolls' " coiffures might have represented for the Corinthians the sexuality of the hierodouloi of Aphrodite and their influence on the prosperity of the city. The connection with Sumerian poetry might seem remote, were it not for the persistence of similar symbols through time.330 For example, a dancing woman in an Etruscan tomb painting makes the protective double-horn sign with extended little and index fingers, a gesture that has persisted in modern times for the same purpose.331 A related symbolism is apparent in the so-called Baubo figurines found in the Sanctuary of Demeter at Priene, in which the head and pubes are directly linked, and the coiffure is topped by a roughly crescent-shaped bowknot.332 It may not be a coincidence that terracotta model vulvas from the Sanctuary of Demeter at Proerna in Thessaly are abstracted into a similar shape.333 The Classical and Hellenistic pierced heads from the Demeter sanctuary, which must have belonged to articulated "dolls," do not wear the loosely flowing coiffure associated with 323 On the question of female nudity in small-scale art before the Classical period, see Scanlon 1988; Bohm 1990; Stewart 1997, pp. 34-42, 231-234, with bibliography on p. 241. 324 Troy, pp. 87-95. 325 Troy, p. 93, with bibliography. 326 Zeitlin 1982, p. 145. 327 On Astarte in Corinth, see C.

Instead, their coiffures are either the elaborations of the hierodouloi or the bound-up styles usually associated with married women. Therefore, it is perhaps not too farfetched to suggest that in the Demeter sanctuary at least some of the "dolls" were dedicated by girls of marriageable age to Aphrodite, and rather than symbolizing the toys of childhood dedicated before marriage to the quintessential bride Kore, they symbolized the about-to-be-achieved sexual maturity of the girls.335 The "dolls" may even have represented the girls themselves as hierodouloi, as a sort of substitute for the original form of ritual prostitution known in the Near East and rejected in that form by the Greeks, in which brides had to offer themselves before marriage in the service of the goddess.336 This form of substitution would have reinforced in a more personal way the Corinthians' provision of slave-hierodouloi for Aphrodite. Nudity is also known in the rituals of Brauron, in which girls may have participated in races in the nude,337 but there the hair was worn loose, not arranged in the fashion ofhetairai. If the above interpretation of the Corinthian "dolls" is correct, the large number of "dolls" found at the Demeter sanctuary (see p. 3) could point to Aphrodite's substantial presence there, beginning at least in the Classical period.338 A new interest in portraying Aphrodite has been found in Early Hellenistic art as a whole.339 Although the nude and semidraped figurines of Aphrodite from the Demeter sanctuary confirm this idea, they do not appear to reflect any known large-scale sculptural types. Unless they derived from works that have been lost, it is likely that their archetypes were created entirely within the world of the small-scale arts. The type repeated most often in the Demeter sanctuary is best preserved in H249 and is fully preserved in a figurine in Berlin, which is published as Corinthian.340 In this type, Aphrodite's left elbow is propped on top of a high, fluted Ionic column, anchoring there a few folds of one corner of her mantle; the upper edge of the mantle is folded down into a narrow overfold and drops at both front and back in deep, torso-framing curves from the column to her right thigh, where her hand pulls the overfold to the side; the left forearm is raised, the hand lifting an edge of the mantle beside her head. The feet are not detailed, but the soles of the sandals or shoes are high. The complete example in Berlin stands on a two-stepped rectangular base. The design is fundamentally a good one, creating a nice tension between the raised left shoulder and arm, stretching upward to reach the column, the balancing curve of cloth to the opposite side, and the heavy drapery, dropping into deep, weighty folds around the legs. The stretch of the left shoulder toward the column also causes a slight torsion, the chest facing more toward the viewer's right than the bent left knee. The execution of all the extant figurines, however, is rather poor. The figurine in Berlin has an overly large head with a peaked coiffure; the head type is recognizably Corinthian, although not exactly matched in the finds from the site. The left hand has lost its drapery and simply rests against the head in a fist. The result is rather awkward, but there are other examples from Corinthian workshops of the spoiling of good types by artisans without the skill necessary to add heads and limbs properly.341 The coroplast responsible for H249 never bothered to provide the figurine with a right arm or a left forearm at all. One might be tempted to call this piece an archetype because it lacks arms,342 but the addition of a head (now lost) and the liberal application of white slip show that it 334 The one exception, the pierced head C141, has both a sphendone binding up the hair and long locks of hair, showing a misunderstanding of both coiffures. 335 For a related interpretation of Athenian "dolls," see Reilly 1997.

The fabric, scale, thick walls, very rough interior, and venting of H249 link it with six other figurines probably made in the same, derivative workshop (Workshop I, see p. 346). H249 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C.; most other members of this workshop group are from the same context. The relatively slender, narrow-shouldered, high-breasted proportions are in line with those of the votary figurines (e.g., HI), which are from similarly dated pottery contexts; the slight torsion of the pose also would fit a later-4th-century B.C. date. H250, from a pottery context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C., repeats some of the squiggles of drapery around the top of the column in H249; at a smaller scale, it is probably a later generation, although its technique points to a different workshop. The artisan, apparently similarly unskilled, did not sharpen the dulled impression with tooling. At this point, the right arm was included in the mold to simplify manufacture, and mantle folds were added behind the shoulders to stabilize the arm, thereby changing the composition. The probable mold siblings H251 and H252 represent a variant type, with a Doric column and a somewhat different compositional relation of column to torso, without folds separating them; the mantle covers the shoulders in back. The pottery context of H252 is the same as that of H249, terminating at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The fragment H255 offers a tantalizing hint of the inspiration for these rather poor figurines. Little more than the left thigh and bent knee are preserved, but at statuette scale (size range 5) and with gilding on the drapery, the original piece must have been quite impressive. The drapery seems thin, but the gilded border that falls diagonally across the thigh is best explained as the hem of a mantle arranged like that of H249. Apart from the pose of the leg and the mantle arrangement, there is no guarantee that other elements of the composition originally paralleled H249, but a thin, fancy mantle with the upper edge draped around the legs does suggest that the figurine represented Aphrodite. A thin fold projecting forward from the mantle fall at the left side may indicate that the garment originally was lifted high in the left hand slightly in front of the figure; in this respect, H255 would have differed in composition from the figurines discussed here. Another hint that there may have been larger versions of a leaning Aphrodite is the fragment H253, which preserves only the top of a fluted column with drapery. While theoretically the column need not have supported a figure of Aphrodite, there are no other candidates for such a composition, with a mantle laid aside, among the preserved figurines, and the zigzag fold in front of the column rather resembles that on the column supporting H252. H254 is another variant, in which the column is lower, so that the bent elbow rests on it at chest level. 114 is a better-preserved and better-made example of this type, but it is an import, probably from Argos. The right hand holds the folded edge of the mantle out to the side, as in H249, but the drapery is tucked between the thighs and covers only the right leg. Since H254 is the only preserved example of this type from the sanctuary in Corinthian fabric, it is not likely to have been a popular local type and may have been copied mechanically from an import. H256 represents yet another variant type, which is fully preserved in an example once in a private collection in Dresden.343 The fold patterns of the two figurines match very closely. The figurine in Dresden is not identified as Corinthian and is said to have been found at Tanagra; its head, with a peaked coiffure, is of 4th-century B.C. type but is not typically Corinthian. The fabric of H256 is of a relatively coarse variety (fabric 5) that is recognizable in numerous Corinthian figurines but sometimes can be difficult to distinguish from Boeotian work (see p. 12). Consequently, it is unclear whether H256 copies a foreign type or is itself an import. There are as well other Boeotian variants of the leaning Aphrodite, which seem to have 343 Winter, Typen II, p. 93, no. 5.</page><page sequence="198">174 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS been quite popular there.344 In this type, as fully preserved, the column top is approximately at shoulder height. The mantle is tucked between the legs but from both sides, covering both legs and generating a zigzag fold cascade of the garment edge; the right hand holds the cloth closer to the body. As in H249, the sandal sole is high; in this case, the details of the foot are preserved, and the long, narrow toes with heavy folds collapsing over them recall the larger Middle Hellenistic foot fragments H423 and H424. These fragments also show high sandal soles, but they are deeply divided around the toes, indicating a date in the 2nd century B.C. or later (see p. 257). Since there are no other figurine types preserved at the Demeter sanctuary with such footwear, it is possible that these fragments point to the survival of semidraped statuettes of Aphrodite until that time. A more modestly draped figurine of Aphrodite is known, of reported Corinthian prove- nience.345 In this type, the mantle is draped across the waist, leaving only the chest bare, and the hem trails only slightly; Eros is perched on top of the low column. The composition is more Classical than Hellenistic, suggesting a date before the middle of the 4th century B.C. The head, which appears from the published drawing to be very like H231, suggests that the reported provenience may well be correct, although the torso type is not represented among the sanctuary finds. Representations of Leda often resemble those of Aphrodite in the arrangement of the mantle to reveal and frame the nude torso, but among the figurines from the Demeter sanctuary, only one certain representation of Leda (H261) can be identified by the presence of a swan. The identification of fragments of suitable composition from which a swan may have broken remains uncertain. Figurines depicting Leda found in the sanctuary could have been appropriate offerings in this cult of fertility goddesses because of the eroticism of the image of Leda's seduction as well as her implied impregnation by Zeus. Throughout the 4th century B.C., Leda was a favorite subject of Boeotian coroplasts, who devised several distinctive designs to portray this subject.346 As in the case of the Aphrodite types discussed above, there are no clear links with monumental sculpture, although the dramatic gesture of lifting the unfastened mantle high appears in the sculptural Leda type attributed to Timotheos347 as well as in some of the figurines.348 In both Leda and Aphrodite types, the raising of the mantle presumably would have suggested to the viewer a very much intensified version of the unveiling of a bride. In H257, the mantle is lifted high at the right side in a composition used for a Leda of reported Corinthian provenience,349 but the figurine could represent Leda only if the missing left side below the thigh originally included a swan. It is possible that the lower part of the type can be completed by H260, which does not have a swan. The slender torso of H257 with its high, full breasts recalls the proportions of the Aphrodite H249, and the pose is similar, although reversed. The fabric, thick walls, and irregular interior surface of H260 link it technically as well as stylistically with H249. Thus it is likely that the two related types representing Aphrodite can be traced to the same workshop (Workshop I, see p. 346), together with five other figurines of different types. The upper torso fragment H259 could be mechanically related to H257, showing the type without added drapery. The very dull modeling of H259 and its grayish fabric are found also in fragments of right hands lifting drapery in lots 2247 and 2249, which could have belonged to figurines of similar type; the 344 E.g., Liepmann 1975, p. 67, no.

The only head that can be associated with this type through the curtain of drapery at the right side is the poorly made and preserved fragment H263. It is smaller in scale and if truly related would represent a later generation. The coiffure shows the long locks of hair associated with Corinthian representations of Aphrodite (see pp. 129-130), in this case, without a polos or other headdress. Just as it was possible to suggest from fragments that a version of the Aphrodite H249 existed at statuette scale, so too the drapery fragment H258, which from the direction of the folds should belong to a curtain from the right side of a figure, suggests the existence of a large-scale Aphrodite or Leda generally similar in type to H257. H261 is the only certain Leda in this group, with the body of the swan held against the left hip. The dull impression, without retouch, indicates that an imported figurine may have been mechanically copied to produce this type. H262 appears to be something of a hybrid. The pillar at the left side points to a composition like that of H249, but the added drapery swag at the right side seems to be curving up into a curtain like that of H257. The divided toe of the shoe of H262 probably points to a Middle Hellenistic date; perhaps this figurine is a relatively late survival. The chiton of H264 bares the right shoulder and part of the breast. The figure may have been in movement toward the viewer's left, since the mantle, which is raised in the left hand, curves forward as if blown from behind. The design is reminiscent of a Classical figurine in the Corinth collection, representing Leda rushing to the left with her mantle held up behind her.350 H264 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the pottery of which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., but the delicately modeled drapery could speak for an early-4th-century B.C. date. The scanty remains of the large statuette H265 are probably best interpreted as a standing Aphrodite leaning on a support at her left side; mantle folds cascade down the front of the support, at the foot of which the baby Eros sits or stands. The gnomelike appearance of Eros may be due to clumsy retouch. Several nude or nearly nude figurines were constructed from the torsos of articulated "dolls." H266 originally may have been arranging her hair, the long tresses of which can be seen on the back. The torso has been manipulated to push out the right hip and to advance the left thigh, to achieve a pose similar to that of H249. When the lower legs were added, the weight would have rested on the right foot. In this case, it is likely that a coroplast in a workshop that made articulated "dolls" found a simple way to imitate a popular type of bronze statuette351 without the requisite mold. H268 even more obviously derives from a "doll's" torso; a mantle was added in an arrangement similar to that of H249, but the garment has broken away in back, revealing the nude buttocks. H267 probably also began as a "doll's" torso, but it has been altered with greater skill, and the fabric is very fine. The pose, in which the right leg moves forward while the shoulders tilt upward to the left, bears a certain resemblance to that of the dancing maenad in Dresden sometimes attributed to Skopas,352 although the figurine shows less torsion, and the garment is flung completely away from the bare torso. Attic reliefs of the Hellenistic period show maenads dancing so strenuously in a similar pose that they are virtually undressed.353 Aphrodite is sometimes depicted dancing but fully clothed, as in a figurine of Aphrodite and Eros in 350 MF-6397, Corinth XII, p. 34, no. 143, pl. 10, there proba- bly dated a little too early and identified as Aphrodite. On this Leda type and its variants, see British Museum I, pp. 231-232, no. 868, pl. 123, with bibliography. The earliest specimens belong to the late 5th century B.C., with later versions being made well into the 4th century B.C. 351 Cf., e.g., Bieber 1961, figs. 36-39. 352 Stewart 1977, pp. 91-93, 140-141, pl. 32; on the attri- bution, see Ridgway 1997, pp. 255-257, with bibliography on p. 278, note 55. 353 Grandjouan 1989, pp. 4-5, 46-47, pls. 1, 2-4, 25, 27.</page><page sequence="200">176 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS London.354 A votive representing a maenad would not be out of place in the Demeter sanctuary, given that offerings were made to Dionysos there (see p. 76) and that figurines of satyrs also were dedicated. Whatever the correct identification, however, this figurine is of good 4th-century B.C. workmanship and is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the pottery of which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. H269 seems to have been developed from a small "doll's" torso. It is not an improvisation, however, but a fully developed type that can be completed with the help of a well-preserved example in Athens (P1. 79),355 which has been recognized as Corinthian. The subject is the birth of Aphrodite. She is seated in front of a stylized open shell with scalloped edges, as if emerging from it; a thin garment is spread across her knees and is held out at either side. The head in the complete example wears a coiffure similar to that of the "doll's" head C139. H270 represents a shell that seems originally to have framed a figurine, although its edges, now missing, may not have been scalloped like the shell in the figurine in Athens; other shell fragments in the lots (see catalogue), however, do have scalloped edges but lack the center where signs of attachment to figurines would be found. None of these shell fragments can be associated with certainty with specific figurine types, but of the types found in the Demeter sanctuary, the Aphrodite is the most obvious candidate. Like so many of the more interesting figurine types from the Demeter sanctuary, H269 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the pottery of which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C.; the context of H270 terminates in the second half of the 4th. Although H269 is an attractive piece, it is actually a simplification of larger and more elaborate renderings of a popular type356 and also conflates two types. In the best renderings, the marine imagery is very clear, through either a realistically shaped shell357 or the representation of waves.358 Aphrodite is kneeling, not seated in the shell, and is not draped; the shell is smooth edged rather than scalloped. One rendering, known in two examples of reported Corinthian provenience,359 has her kneeling in the shell in front of a mantle held up by Eros; the mantle covers one knee. A related non-Corinthian type has the goddess kneeling on an upright flower rather than a shell;360 the mantle, held up by Eros or the goddess herself, frames her and covers both knees. The coroplast who designed H269 has used both types, retaining the mantle over both knees, turning the flower into a skirt, and adding a shell as well. His conflation implies that both types were known in Corinth in their original forms. The shell is believed to have been a symbol of the vulva in ancient Greece, and representations of Aphrodite emerging from shells to have symbolized the phenomenon of birth.361 Actual shells were frequently dedicated at the sanctuary in Roman times.362 The motif of the mantle framing the head and torso is also known in types in which goddesses or nymphs ride on an assortment of animals, with the garment billowing over the head as if windblown. Sometimes the mantle is absent, and the figures are seated on the animals in a variety of poses, often turned to one side or in an only semiseated posture. An Archaic grotesque bird-rider was found at the Demeter sanctuary (MF-11873),363 but the only later evidence at the 354 British Museum I, pp. 263-264, no. 970, pl. 137, identified as Corinthian; in Higgins 1963, p. 19, the woman is identified as Aphrodite.

MF-10352 in the Corinth collection depicts a woman seated on a bird with a round loaf(?) in her lap. Animal-riders likely to be Corinthian or related to Corinthian types include another female figure on a bird,364 a Europa in Berlin riding the bull,365 a semidraped female figure in Copenhagen who rides a hippocamp,366 and in London Thetis riding a hippocamp and carrying a helmet.367 These figures do not have billowing mantles. H271 does have a mantle curved over her head and is in a partly seated pose, as shown by a crease of flesh across her abdomen. While she could represent a mounted goddess, another possible identification is Leda, who in the Timothean sculpture is shown standing but bent at the waist in response to the approach of the swan.368 The raised right arm of H271 lifting the garment away from the torso would also be in accord with a representation of Leda. Whatever the correct identification, H272 may be the head of a comparable figurine. H271 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the pottery of which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The very poorly preserved head H273 is almost certainly from a mounted figure, to judge from the great arc of drapery over it. Although the surface is poorly preserved, earrings are visible, as well as the outlines of a coiffure with a high topknot in front similar to that of C135, a head related to articulated "dolls." Good compositional parallels can be found in figurines of Aphrodite Pandemos seated on a goat or other animal.369 The worship of Aphrodite with this cult title was associated with hetairai elsewhere;370 the coiffure of H273 points in the same direction (see p. 171), although Aphrodite is not attested at Corinth with this cult title. Among the semidraped figurines found in the Demeter sanctuary are some that resemble representations of Aphrodite in the baring of the torso, but they are usually perched on rocky outcrops; these seats, suggesting rustic places, usually can be taken to distinguish nymphs from Aphrodite, although representations of the goddess (identified by the presence of Eros or a goose) on a rocky seat are not unknown.371 Muses also are frequently depicted on rocky seats, but they are usually fully clothed.372 The very name "nymph," which signifies a young nubile woman, is a connection with marriage; nymphs provide water for the bridal bath in myth and received bridal sacrifices in real life.373 In myth, nymphs are sometimes amorous and vindictive, as in the story of Daphnis and his nymph lover (Diodoros 4.84), or chaste but irresistible to a god, as in the case of Artemis' nymph Kallisto (Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.405-507). Because of their frequent association with lovers in myth, their images in art probably implied sexuality. Nymphs were sometimes the caretakers of children, but nymphs also could be dangerous to them and were sometimes thought to have carried off children who had died.374 In Euripides' Electra (lines 625-627) sacrifice to the nymphs is mentioned for the safety of children and for impending childbirth. Nymphs frequently appear in art with Pan or satyrs, who are also represented at the Demeter sanctuary (see pp. 78-79, 199-200). All these associations work well for this sanctuary, but most importantly, nymphs are known to have been worshiped together with chthonic deities, 364 Winter, Typen I, p. 162, no. 7. 365 Kdnigliche Museen, pp. 24-25, pi.

Since the composition shows torsion, which suggests a 4th-century B.C. stylistic date, and two mold siblings (see catalogue) are from the construction fill of the theTrapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., this figurine is probably not too far from its prototype. The proportions of the torso, slender, narrow-shouldered, and high-breasted, are typical of later-4th-century B.C. Corinthian work and resemble those of the Aphrodite H249. The rocky seat is high, and the figure half sits, half leans against it. The left knee is raised, and the foot is propped on a shelf at the base of the seat. The torsion arises from the turning of the shoulders toward the right hand, which rests on the seat behind the hip. The left hand and right foot are relaxed. Although not fully seated, the pose is nevertheless natural. In a 2nd-century B.C. sculptural counterpart known in several replicas from Rhodes and Priene, the pose has become contorted and is full of tension, without a natural relation to the seat.377 This Late Hellenistic sculptural version shows Classicizing elements and may have been developed from a 4th-century B.C. source, to which the prototype of H274 could have been related. H275 is probably a later generation of H274, in which the mantle arrangement has been altered to cover the whole back; a similar alteration was made to H250, which is a later generation of the standing Aphrodite H249. H276 is only a fragment of the lower part, but the distinctive hand, relaxed on the lap with some of the fingers curled under, suggests that the complete type was similar to H274 but in a reversed pose. Another, rather poor example with pose reversed is in the Corinth collection (MF-7399).378 H277 may be derived from the same type, with the pose reversed, but all the interesting elements in the design have been lost. Only the raised left shoulder hints at the original composition; the pose has little torsion, the figure really sits rather than leans, the feet rest on the base at the same level, and the right hand seems originally to have been extended, instead of resting in the lap. An arch of drapery around the shoulders recalls the billowing mantles of animal-riders, but the feet seem to rest on a rocky base. H278 is similar to H277 in composition but is of nearly miniature scale, with both forearms originally extended and with the whole rocky seat preserved. The type seems to have been fairly popular, with several distinct mold series. It must have deteriorated already within the 4th century B.C., since one of the fragments from which H277 is mended is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The associated head type is unknown, but only MF-7399 has traces of hair on the shoulders; a bound-up coiffure appears to have been more common. The fragment H279 wears a chiton beneath a mantle draped around the hips to frame the abdomen. In this respect, the figurine resembles standing draped types such as H128, but it could not have been standing because of its greatly reduced depth. The figure originally may have been seated on a separately made base in a languid, half-reclining pose, similar to that of MF-10144 from the Baths of Aphrodite.379 That figurine, molded together with its rocky seat, is from a deposit dated ca. 375-300 B.C. It is known in complete form in an example in Athens of Corinthian provenience380 and appears to represent Aphrodite regarding herself in a mirror. H279 cannot have been identical in type, because the mantle is arranged somewhat differently, 375 Morgantina, p. 93, with bibliography; RE IV, 2, 1901, cols. 2755-2756, s.v. Demeter (O.

Their chronology is in agreement, since the pottery context of H279 terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Two seated figurines (H280 and H281) wear a chiton slipped from one shoulder and a mantle across the lap, a costume worn by Aphrodite in figurines from other centers.381 H280 nevertheless seems to have some typological relation to the nymph H274 and its variants, although it is of larger scale and better fabric, and its broader shoulders and less slender proportions suggest that the prototype was rooted in the Classical tradition. The relaxed right hand with curled fingers suggests a mirror image of the nymph H274, but the hand rests at the side rather than on the lap and seems originally to have held something. The left arm must have been raised, but the position of the hand (perhaps touching the hair?) is unknown. The chiton folds added to the nude torso are clinging and transparent, leaving the right shoulder bare and calling to mind sculptural renderings of the late 5th and early 4th centuries B.C.382 The combination of bared right shoulder and long locks of hair is found in a Corinthian figurine in Athens, which can be identified as Aphrodite by the presence of Eros (P1. 78).383 Whether H280 represents a nymph, on the basis of its pose, or Aphrodite, on the basis of the costume and coiffure, is uncertain because of the overlapping iconography of the two subjects, but it is clearly another example of a well-crafted piece of excellent fabric that stands alone, apparently outside the general run of more popular figurines (see p. 29). The retouch is extensive even for a Corinthian artisan, and the unusual method of head attachment (see catalogue) further separates H280 from other Corinthian work. Although the pottery context of H280 terminates in the early 3rd century B.C., the style and good fabric should place it before the middle of the 4th century B.C. The original pose of H281 could have been close to that of the nymph H274 in reverse, since the pulled-back, raised left shoulder suggests that the hand could have rested on the seat in back; the position of the right shoulder is appropriate to an arm originally resting on the lap. Traces of long locks of hair only on the right shoulder indicate that the head originally may have been turned to the left. Although the pose with its torsion and traces of a mantle across the lap link H281 with H274, the broad-shouldered proportions and the shoulder-baring, transparent chiton connect it with the larger H280. The drapery arrangement in the two figurines is reversed, but there are some similarities in the fold patterns of the chitons, particularly in the relatively wide, diagonal double fold that defines the upper edge of the cloth and the looped fold that dips below the navel. The drapery of H281 is simpler, however, and most importantly, it is rendered in the mold, with little retouch. The maker of its archetype followed the method of the Attic Late Classical Rich Style by adding ridges to a nude torso to indicate transparent cloth, as seen, for example, in the Nike untying her sandal on the Balustrade of the Temple of Athena Nike.384 At least in the design as preserved, however, the coroplast dispensed with the elaborations and flourishes characteristic of Rich Style drapery, settling on a design more coherent in its emphasis on simplicity and volume.385 Perhaps the larger H280 represents an earlier stage in the development of such types, before finished molds were available and the drapery had to be rendered by hand. The fusion in H281 of compositional torsion with proportions and drapery still based on Late Classical style suggests a date of about the middle of the 4th century B.C. The pottery context of H281 terminates in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C., but the figurine must be earlier on stylistic and technical grounds. 381 E.g., Winter, Typen II, p. 107, no. 2, with Eros. 382 On the denuding of the shoulder in representations of Aphrodite, see Delivorrias 1991, pp. 135-150; Harrison 1982, pp. 86-87. 383 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160; see p. 130, note 88. 384 Conveniently, Lullies and Hirmer 1960, pl. 191. 385 Compare, in this respect, a 4th-century B.C.

A55).</page><page sequence="204">180 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS Whether the figurines in this group represent nymphs or Aphrodite, a good deal of care was lavished on them, and the subject seems to have engaged the best workshops. The fragmentary H282, with its fine fabric and violet mantle, must have been beautiful when complete. A nonjoining fragment shows what appears to be a portion of the rocky seat at the left side of the figure; the mantle folds on it are crumpled in the Rich Style manner, as if crushed by the pressure of the now missing hand, but the collapsing folds between the legs are organized more geometrically. Since the upper broken edge of these folds continues upward, it is likely that the mantle fell from the left shoulder. Whether the upper torso was nude or clothed in a chiton is unknown. The seat originally must have been higher than that of H274, since the richly folded mantle collapses onto a shelf well below the level of the feet. The right leg appears to be stretched forward, as if the figure took a languid pose that allowed the mantle to fall between the legs. One of the fragments of this figurine comes from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The high technical quality and the design, as far as preserved, are consonant with a 4th-century B.C. date. H281 and H282 are related to one another in their sparing, selective incorporation of Rich Style elements into designs that emphasize structure over surface treatments; a stylistic date for the archetypes in the first half of the 4th century B.C. seems reasonable. H283 is a still more meager fragment, preserving only the left foot and surrounding drapery, which nevertheless can be identified with some likelihood. The foot does not rest flat on the base but is lifted against an irregular support. The drapery collapses in a thick double fold, suggesting a mantle draped loosely around the legs. Therefore, the figurine may represent a nymph or Aphrodite on a rocky seat. The deeply divided toe of the sandal, however, indicates a Middle Hellenistic date and suggests the survival of this type into the late 3rd or first half of the 2nd century B.C. The remaining three fragments in this group are less informative. H284 preserves only the right leg and surrounding drapery. To judge from the angle of the thigh, the figure was either perched on a high seat or bent over in a pose like that of Leda. The diagonal folds at the proper right side of the leg suggest that the drapery was either spread over a seat or lifted in the right hand. Since the folds of the undergarment as well as the mantle are diagonal, the former design is more likely. Because folds envelope the other (inner) side of the leg, the right leg must have been extended forward or the left leg, now missing, was pulled back. The molding of the leg beneath the drapery and the high-soled sandal could suggest that the subject is Aphrodite. The good technical quality and the cuffed fold over the ankle, as in H85, point to a 4th-century B.C. date. In H285, the mantle does not collapse but is wrapped neatly around the legs. The pointed slipper, narrowly folded chiton, and the length and fold pattern of the mantle resemble a Corinthian figurine in Paris that probably represents the seated Aphrodite with Eros.386 H286 is merely a foot in a sandal with a divided toe, but it belonged to a well-made statuette. Since the mantle is wrapped closely around the ankle on both sides, the foot must have been well advanced. Most likely the figurine originally was seated languidly, with one foot forward.387 Both fragments are from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. 386 Louvre III, p. 54, no.

While Eros was usually depicted as a flying baby in terracotta figurines of the Hellenistic period, in Corinth he appears also as a youth or boy (i.e., as an Eros ephebe). There does not appear to have been a fixed iconographic tradition, however, and there is variety even within this small group. He appears as a young boy standing together with Aphrodite in a Corinthian figurine in Athens (P1. 78)388 and another of similar type in the Corinth collection389 and with a Corinthian seated Aphrodite in Paris.390 As a youth he accompanies a muffled woman, probably a bride, in a figurine of reported Corinthian provenience in Berlin.391 Apart from the fragmentary H265, which depicts a baby in front of a drapery panel and is probably all that remains of a statuette of Aphrodite with Eros, four recognizable representations of Eros were found in the Demeter sanctuary. Two of these also depict Eros as a baby; one of the remaining two is an adolescent, and the last is perhaps a slightly younger boy. In addition, there are wing fragments (see V31) that could have belonged to a flying figure such as Eros. Several of the isolated heads of children discussed below (pp. 192-193) also could have belonged to representations of Eros. His appearance in the Demeter sanctuary is related either to the shrine's function in furthering human fertility or to the identification of this deity with death, in the form of Eros-Thanatos.392 Generally speaking, Eros was depicted as a youth in the Classical period and as a child in Hellenistic times, but this general "rule" is an oversimplification. The transformation of Eros from a youth to a child can be observed better in vase painting than in sculpture or figurines, and it is clear that there was some overlap of types, particularly in the 4th century.393 Moreover, the ages at which Eros was depicted actually vary greatly, from real babyhood through various stages of prepubescent boyhood and adolescence to fully matured youth. Of the erotes from the Demeter sanctuary, only one is from a datable context, but that one shows that Eros may already have been represented as a baby early in the 4th century B.C. (see discussion of H290 below). H287 is a seated Eros of youthful type but with full hips and a childlike softness around the abdomen and thighs. Although there are no traces of locks of hair on the shoulders, the shape of the break suggests that the hair originally fell along the neck. The missing wings were molded separately and inserted into slots at the back, instead of being attached with clay, as in the case of H291. Although the right arm is relaxed, the left arm originally was raised very high together with the wing, as is apparent from the break at the shoulder and the raised wing slot. A similarly lifted arm is found in Eros figurines from Myrina, but the figure 388 National Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 4160; see p. 130, note 88. 389 MF-1060, Corinth XII, p. 34, no. 139, pl. 9. 390 Louvre III, p. 54, no. D300, pl. 63:b. The boy is wingless here, but the group seems to represent the two deities. 391 Rohde 1968, pp. 43-44, no. 23. Although it is not possi- ble to confirm this provenience through finds from Corinth, the broad style, iconography, and fabric seem to be within the parameters for Corinth, to judge from the description and color photo published by Rohde. A somewhat similar type in London from Naukratis has been assigned to Corinth: British Museum I, pp. 264-265, no. 971, pl. 137. An Eros with a danc- ing Aphrodite in the British Museum probably should be dis- sociated from Corinth (see p. 176, note 354). The provenience of a standing Eros with a small dog, said to be from Corinth (Winter, Typen II, p. 246, no. 4B), cannot be confirmed on the basis of finds from Corinth. MF-9254 in the Corinth collec- tion is a winged boy Eros holding a mirror case (Romano 1994, p. 91, no. 79, pl. 28). MF-8063 is another winged Eros, but sev- eral other pieces in the Corinth collection, once thought possi- bly to represent Eros (MF-3882, MF-39, MF-1423, MF-3863, Corinth XII, pp. 52-53, nos. 349, 350, 352, 353, pl. 31), are probably better considered mortals, in the absence of specific attributes and in light of the increased repertoire of Corinthian youths and children now known. A fine, standing youthful Eros from the Forum Southwest excavations (MF-71-38 [Michaud 1972, pp. 638-639, fig. 124]) could be an Attic import. 392 Vermeule 1979, pp. 161-162, with bibliography. 393 E.g., a mid-4th-century B.C. nuptial lebes by the Marsyas Painter shows baby and boy erotes in the same painting: Arias and Hirmer 1962, pl. 226.</page><page sequence="206">182 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS is flying rather than seated.394 Although the lower legs of H287 are missing, to judge from the broken surfaces, the right leg seems to have been stretched forward and the left pulled back. Parallels for such a seated Eros are found in 4th-century B.C. red-figured vases but without the raised arm.395 The pose is known in sculpture, not for Eros but for a young satyr who is just falling asleep, with his arm resting languidly on his head, still seated upright on a rocky base.396 When Eros is shown sleeping in sculpture, however, he usually is a small child in a fully recumbent pose or is leaning on a support.397 Because the base of H287 is broken away or covered with drapery, it is not clear whether Eros sat on a rock or a backless blocklike seat similar to that of the boys H335 and H336 (see p. 191). H288 represents a nude youth on a rocky seat. Since mortal youths seated outdoors are generally shown mantled, as in H311, it is possible that H288 is another representation of the resting Eros. The pose is different, however, almost leaning against the seat rather than sitting on it, with one hand resting behind on the rock, as in the nymph H274. Further, although the left side of the youth is preserved almost up to the shoulder, there is no sign of a wing. It is therefore also possible that the figurine represents the youthful Pan, depicted with human legs, as in H387. The compositions of both H288 and H387 are flat, almost pictorial, and the figurines have little depth, as if the designs had been taken from reliefs. Only the head and wings of H289 are preserved, and it is of rather poor quality, with heavy and clumsy retouch, but the distinctive headdress, a polos, which is unusual for Eros, marks the type and is paralleled by an Attic figurine.398 The reference of the polos for this deity probably is its use as a bridal crown. Since there is no other evidence for the type in Corinth, perhaps H289 was mechanically copied from an imported figurine, with the dulled details retouched unskillfully. The two baby erotes from the Demeter sanctuary are H290 and H291. H291 preserves more of the torso, although it is smaller and of lesser quality. The remains of one wing are spread, showing that the Eros was in flight; the head is thrown back, and the right arm originally reached forward. The breaks below the arm indicate that the right side originally was attached to something. This Eros is likely to have been hovering in the air, his torso horizontal, above the left shoulder of another figure, probably Aphrodite. If this reconstruction of the composition is correct, the relation of the two figures would have been like that of the Aphrodite and Eros in the "slipper-slapper" sculpture from Delos.399 H290 preserves only the head and part of the back but seems originally to have been in a similar pose. The workmanship of this Eros is excellent. The pottery context with which it was found dates to the early 4th century B.C., which may seem early for a flying baby Eros, but there are reasons why this date is likely to be close to the mark. Apart from its context, the fine technique of this figurine suggests that it was made not later than the middle of the 4th century B.C. In addition, it should be kept in mind that Corinthian bronze workers before this time already were designing mirrors surrounded with running and flying figures, including erotes.400 Consequently, one need not doubt an earlier date for baby erotes in Corinth than the 3rd-century B.C. date usually assigned to their appearance among "Tanagra" and Myrina figurines.401 H290 is related in scale, facial type, and workmanship of the hair to the wreathed baby's head H348 and may have been made in the same workshop (Workshop E, see p. 345). Although wreaths are worn both by Eros and human children, in light of the stylistic and technical relationship between the two pieces, it is possible that H348 also represents the deity. 394 E.g., Louvre II, p. 37, no.

Two further female figurines could represent Artemis, H292, which is in movement and may be reaching back to a quiver, and H293, which wears a baldric and also may have a quiver. The evidence for the presence of Artemis as a "visiting" deity at the Demeter sanctuary is thus not very strong, although some of Artemis' functions, such as her patronage of young people before marriage and her connection with childbirth, would be in keeping with the concerns for human fertility and the safety of children apparent at this shrine.403 She was worshiped at Corinth as Artemis Eukleia (Xenophon, Hellenika 4.4.2); under this epithet at Thebes, Artemis received offerings from brides and bridegrooms, although elsewhere the name defined her as a goddess of war.404 A small number of figurines of Artemis came to light at Morgantina in association with the worship of Persephone; there these votives are thought to reflect the chthonic worship of Artemis in the West and her function, in the form of Hekate, in the story of Kore's recovery from the Underworld, as told in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter.405 If the figurines here presented do indeed represent Artemis, H293 in its complete form may have resembled the sculptured Dresden Artemis type,406 with the pose reversed. The connection is not unreasonable, since this Artemis type has been connected with a monument in Megara known from both Pausanias and representations on Megarian coins. The more active pose of H292 echoes another sculptural type known in Roman copies but associated with the 4th century B.C., the Artemis of Versailles-Leptis Magna.407 Three Artemis types of Roman date (R15, R16, and R29), a much larger proportion of the total, in light of the small quantity of Roman figurines preserved, suggest that the goddess played a more important role in the sanctuary during that period. ATHENA A single representation of Athena (H294) has been tentatively identified as such by the Little Owl, the species specifically associated with the goddess, in her hand. In addition, the garment, as far as it is preserved, could be the so-called peplos of Athena (see p. 32). Athena is sometimes represented in various media holding her owl.408 The relatively high girding of the garment suggests an Early Hellenistic date, with which its archaeological context agrees. NIKE Nike is probably the subject of H295, on the basis of the strong forward movement of the right leg, the flying skirt folds at the sides, and the partially nude (or transparently draped) legs. An example of similar type from the Forum Southwest excavations (MF-71-42 [PI. 76)409 is of much better fabric and workmanship and is preserved up to the waist, although the legs are closer together; this figurine, from a context dating to the third quarter of the 4th century B.C., resembles in technique the short-skirted articulated "doll" C174 and may have been constructed on a "doll's" torso. Another similar Nike figurine from the Athenian Agora is thought to be of 402 Publication forthcoming. 403 See Farnell, Cults II, pp. 444, 566-568.

In spite of variations among Nike figurines of this general type, all probably depend ultimately on late-5th-century B.C. conceptions of Nike, as seen, for example, in the Nike of Paionios in Olympia.411 Nearer to Corinth, interest in the subject during the 4th century is evident at Epidauros, in the akroteria of the Temples of Asklepios and Artemis.412 The creation of Corinthian Nike types during the 4th century B.C., such as MF-71-42 and the example in Athens, could have been inspired by the successful activities of Timoleon in Sicily. In fact, there was a connection between Demeter and Nike in Sicily, in a statue at Enna of Demeter holding Nike in her right hand.413 It is unclear, however, whether H295 can be explained in this way. The figurine was made unskillfully of poor fabric, with such thick walls that it is nearly solid. While it could have been made during the 4th century B.C. by an unskilled craftsman, its fabric is of a type more common in the 3rd century B.C., and it is more likely to be a later survival of a good 4th-century B.C. type. Perhaps the victory it suggests was agonistic rather than political or military, referring to the races run by youths in honor of Kore (see p. 61). The discovery of a figurine of Nike at Morgantina is explained by her iconographic connection in vase painting with Hades and Persephone, and more generally with wedding scenes.414 The three remaining figurines possibly representing Nike are equally poor, suggesting that she was at best a marginal deity at the Demeter sanctuary. H296 is a miniature with little detail. There are no wings, and the position of the right hand on the hip is not really characteristic of Nike, but the right leg is advanced as if stepping off the base into the air. H296 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The fragmentary torso H297 owes its identification as Nike to a flaring, presumably wind- blown overfold like that of a probably Corinthian figurine of Nike in Berlin.415 On a larger scale, a similar overfold is found on a Nike akroterion from the Artemision at Epidauros416 and another from Delos.417 It is, unfortunately, unknown whether H295 originally had such an overfold because of its poor state of preservation. Although the flaring overfold of H297 indicates swift movement, the rigidity of the torso suggests that the figurine may have been constructed from a "doll's" torso. If H297 is correctly identified, H298 also could represent Nike. In this case, the overfold flares out even more, and the chiton slips down from the left shoulder as well, as it does in the Nike of Paionios. The flaring hem could belong to a dancer's short skirt rather than an overfold, since it is not entirely clear whether or not the thighs were bare, but the skirts of Corinthian dancers are usually longer, reaching the knees, as in C176. As in the case of H297, the type may have been built on a "doll's" torso. The pottery context of H298 terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. 410 Inv. no. T-2309, H. A. Thompson 1947, p. 208, pl. XLV:3. The identification of the fabric was suggested originally by Marie Farnsworth and was conveyed to me by Dorothy B. Thompson, who has also noted that the figurine does not cor- respond to Attic taste (D. B. Thompson 1984, p. 34, fig. 6); a Pergamene connection is suggested but without supporting evidence. Farnsworth's suggested attribution has merit; the addition by hand of drapery folds around the nude-seeming hips and legs is known in Corinth in the conversion of nude torsos of "dolls" to draped types (see p. 58); the Nike's short- waisted torso proportions and chubby shoulders and arms are also found in Corinthian figurines (e.g., H281). 411 Holscher 1974. 412 Yalouris 1992, pp. 19-21, nos. 2-5, pls. 3-8:b; pp. 30- 31, no. 25, pls. 24-26; pp. 84-85, fig. 27; Ridgway 1990, pp. 149-150, with bibliography on p. 199, note 1. 413 Mentioned by Cicero in connection with the crimes of Verres, Second Verrine 4.49; for Hellenistic coins of Enna pic- turing this statue, see HistNum, p. 137. 414 Morgantina, p. 94. 415 Knoblauch 1939, cols. 445, 437-438, figs. 28, 29, pub- lished as Attic; on the likelihood that this Nike is Corinthian, see p. 166.

It is possible, however, that poorly made, anatomically undefined examples such as H305 and H307 could have represented mature men with short beards, which have left no traces on the torso. The typology of the standing youths is similar to that of the Classical period (see pp. 60-62), although a larger proportion are draped around the lower torso and legs, and the poses are more languid, with outthrust right hips. The general similarity to the earlier youths suggests that these too represent votaries, although only one example (H302) preserves an offering in the hand (a bunch of grapes). H299 appears to be completely nude, although the panel between the legs may indicate a drapery backdrop. The softness of the anatomy and the sinuous pose contribute to the impression of adolescence. The slight effeminacy probably can be attributed not only to the youth of the subject but also to a workshop relationship (Workshop H, see p. 346) with a female figurine, the piglet carrier H1. In both figurines, the head and neck are unusually deep; both show long locks of hair over the shoulders and a similar sloping profile; the relaxed position of the right arm is similar, although the youth is empty handed. The youth is somewhat smaller in scale, suggesting that we may be missing an earlier generation. The two figurines are good examples of how a single design could be altered to develop two entirely different mold archetypes, male and female, with a thematic relationship (both represent votaries), forming an iconographic series. The essentially "Praxitelean" pose of H299 is shared by two male figurines with nude torsos and partial drapery (H300 and H301). H300 originally leaned on a support, a composition unusual for votary figurines in Corinth; in this case, the mantle falls over the left shoulder and down the side. This figurine is in a poor fabric and may be relatively late. In H301, the youth stretches a mantle behind himself, as if to display the nude torso. This almost plaquelike figurine has a better-preserved parallel in the Corinth collection (MF-3882), which shows a round, smiling face and long locks of hair to the shoulders.418 Of these three figurines, only H300 is from a chronologically useful context, which terminates in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. Five standing male figurines wear the mantle draped over the left or both shoulders and around the waist, in a manner comparable to the Classical C199. H302, the best made of the group, has a softly contoured, childish torso and carries a bunch of grapes as does the boy H319, but the hip-thrust pose and drapery are more like those of a youth. The grapes suggest an offering either to Demeter in her function as protector of agricultural fertility or perhaps to Dionysos, who is also represented at the sanctuary (see pp. 76-78).419 A connection with Dionysos rather than Demeter is suggested by a slightly larger figurine from the South Stoa, similarly draped and with a fleshy torso but carrying a tragic mask rather than grapes.420 This parallel is from a deposit with a terminus ante quem of ca. 250 B.C. It is possible that the slight corpulence of this type points to a representation of Silenos, for whom both the grapes and mask would be suitable attributes,421 but there are no traces of a beard, and in the absence of a head, a certain identification is difficult. H304 is similar in type to H302, as far as it is preserved, but is of poorer quality. The fragmentary H303 is a possible rendition of a similar type at statuette scale. The unarticulated torso and protruding abdomen recall H302, and the added mantle could have 418 Corinth XII, p. 52, no. 349, pl. 31, identified as Eros. 419 On the symbolism of grapes and the vine in Greek art, see Goodenough 1956, VI, pp. 46-60. See also p. 194. 420 MF-1904, Corinth XII, p. 51, no. 336, pl. 30, identified as an actor, but youths and children sometimes carry masks (e.g., Winter, Typen II, p. 288, no. 6). 421 Cf., e.g., a similarly draped Tarentine type with grapes, Winter, Typen II, p. 399, no. 11.</page><page sequence="210">186 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS been draped in a similar manner, although the poor preservation of the figure precludes certain identification. It is also possible that the statuette represented a mantled boy similar to H334. Three standing male figurines similar to one another in scale are of rather poor quality. H305 originally may have been of a type similar to H302 and H304 but altered by the addition of a draped right arm; the fabric is poor. H306 is of reasonably good fabric but lacks anatomical definition. An offering may have been held against the torso by the right hand. The composition of H307 appears to have been distorted, so that the left shoulder is raised very high; perhaps the type originally included a support at the side, like that of H300. The fabric and workmanship again are very poor. Three more standing, semidraped male figures (H308-H310) are larger in scale, one of them (H310) reaching statuette size, but similarly they are not of the best quality and do not point to an established iconography. All three, in fact, seem to be improvisations in which drapery was added to a nude male type in a stance similar to that of H299-H301. The type continues a nude male type known in the Classical period (see p. 63), and it is noteworthy that similarly draped Classical male figures such as C199 also were ad hoc constructions developed from available materials. Presumably, the demand for this type iswas limited. H308 and H309, with long locks of hair on the shoulders and no signs of a beard, must represent youths, like the similarly coiffed H299. Since terracotta sculptures of youths from the sanctuary are also draped to leave the right side of the torso bare,422 it is possible that the figurines represent the same subjects offered perhaps by those who could not afford a statue. The technique ofH309 and H310 is very peculiar, perhaps because they were made by an inexperienced coroplast. Apart from the crudity of the retouch, both figurines are greatly reduced in depth. H310 was stuffed with lumps of clay, perhaps to add stability to the shallow figure. The unusual technique and flat modeling make these figures appear later in date, but H309 was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., and the latest date of the pottery context of H308 is the early 3rd century B.C. The lack of mold siblings for any of the Early Hellenistic standing male figurines and their improvisational quality show that they were not very popular votive types. Only H302 and H304 are compositionally similar, but these two figurines may have represented children or Silenos rather than youths. The generally indifferent quality of the male figurines supports the impression of marginality. Only H302 is reasonably well made; the higher quality would be understandable if the figurine represents a boy rather than a youth, since much more attention was lavished on figurines of children. The three examples of seated male figurines of this period include one of Boeotian inspiration. For the Classical period, a Boeotian figurine type found in the Kabeirion at Thebes may have been the source of one of the standing male types (see p. 62). The source of H311, a mantled youth seated on a rocky base, appears to be a class of Boeotian figurines with a number of variants, found in tombs and dated ca. 330-250 B.C.423 This class represents a youth in his late teens with short, curly hair and wearing a mantle, boots, and a petasos or wreath. The footwear of H3 11 is not clearly rendered, and there is no hat or wreath, but the garment is the same, fastened at the right shoulder and leaving the arm bare, and the hair has been retouched to approximate the curly coiffure. That this type was relatively popular in Corinth is suggested by the existence of a later generation (see catalogue). The type also seems to have had funerary significance in Corinth, since a mold sibling of H311, MF-13904, was found in a burial in Corinth, together with an imported example (MF-13900) in an orange-brown fabric with sparkling inclusions that is probably Boeotian.424 The dull modeling of H311 and MF-13904 suggests that their mold may have been taken from such an imported figurine. MF-13900 cannot itself have been the 422 Bookidis 1988, pl. 4:1, 3 (SF-65-14). 423 Higgins 1986, pp. 150, 152-154, figs. 186-188. 424 From grave 1929-23, unpublished.</page><page sequence="211">DISCUSSION 187 model, however, since it parallels the arm positions and the fold patterns on the chest but has differently composed legs, with a flatter lap and a more frontal pose. There is evidence for Athenian participation in the development of these ephebic types,425 but the presence in Corinth of a similar Boeotian version suggests that the immediate source is to be found there. H312 is a tantalizing fragment of a seated male statuette, probably handmade, wearing a garment that reaches the calf. The thickness of the ankle and the absence of defined toes suggest that he may be wearing soft boots. The similarity of the costume to that ofH311 and the related figurines raises the possibility that H312 was an attempt to render a similar type at larger scale by hand, in the absence of a suitable mold of the desired size. The lap is flat, like that of the Boeotian MF- 13900. The irregularity of the break suggests that the seat could have been a rocky base. The fragmentary and summarily executed H313, wearing what appears to be a knee-length tunic, could be yet another youth, this time on a blocklike seat. ISOLATED MALE HEADS (H314-H318) The five isolated heads include three that have short, curly coiffures like the ephebic types discussed above, although the nature of the torsos to which they originally belonged is not known. Most are of size range 3-4, approaching statuette scale and considerably larger than the standing and seated male types discussed above, with the exception of the fragmentary statuette H312. With the possible exception of H317, these heads were rather poorly made, with distorted or clumsily retouched features. The flat-topped H315 originally may have worn a hat, perhaps a petasos. It has curved incisions on the cranium, as does H314, suggesting that they were made in the same workshop. H316 wears a wreath, which is also a characteristic ephebic headdress. Its fabric is the poorest of the group; its combination of sharply tooled hair and undefined features speak of a poor mold rather than a worn surface. In spite of the poverty of workmanship, however, the strong turn of the head on the neck points to an interesting design and the possibility that the mold for this figurine also was copied from an imported piece. H317 has a curly coiffure of chin length similar to the hair of Boeotian figurines of boys,426 and it originally may have worn a wreath, as do these children. The facial features of H317, however, are both more delicate and less childlike. H318 is somewhat puzzling, since the face, with its pathetic air, is similar in type to the female head H192, and the corkscrew curls recall another female head (of H57). The female heads wear the polos, however, while H318 wears a turban. This headdress is found combined with corkscrew curls on the Archaic head MF-12162,427 which has red paint on the flesh and therefore should be from a male figurine. On the basis of this combination of coiffure and headdress, and since individual head molds could be used for both male and female figurines, H318 has been included with male figurines, although this identification is not entirely certain. CHILDREN (H319-H354) Representations of children continue to be a significant part of the sanctuary's coroplastic repertoire in the Early Hellenistic period, and the range of figurine types was greatly enriched by a growing interest in portraying children at various stages of physical development and in new poses. The seated baby boys of Classical type (see pp. 68-73) probably continued to be dedicated at least into the third quarter of the 4th century B.C., when the workshops of the Potters' Quarter, 425 D. B. Thompson 1963. 426 E.g., in London, Higgins 1986, pp. 150, 152, fig. 185. 427 Publication forthcoming.</page><page sequence="212">188 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS which created many of these figurines, ceased production. While the Classical repertoire empha- sized babies, with a few older boys, Early Hellenistic workshops reversed the proportion, showing their best and most prolific work in representations of boys perhaps two or three to six years of age.428 The custom of nudity for boys, as known in the Classical period, continues, revealing the ages of these boys through their sloping shoulders, soft pectorals, fleshy bellies, short, chubby legs, and lack of modeling (presumably to convey the undeveloped musculature of children). The boys of this group are related to some of the previously discussed Classical and Early Hellenistic youths (C188-C198 and H299-H301) in their standing poses, the offerings in their hands, and the framing of their nude torsos by drapery over the shoulder and down the back. Anatomically, however, the youths are clearly older. The Classical youths (e.g., C188) are square shouldered, slender and have flat abdomens, indicating that they are post- rather than prepubescent. The Early Hellenistic youths (e.g., H299) are somewhat soft and languid in rendering, but they also have leaner torsos than the younger boys, and their longer-legged proportions are more adult. When part of the anatomy is covered by drapery, it can be difficult to decide whether a figurine was intended to represent a young boy or a youth. H302 has the soft chest and abdomen of a child, but the figure is draped over the hips and legs like an adult in a mantle with a triangular overfold and on this basis has been grouped with the youths (see p. 185). On e the other hand, H334, which also is childish anatomically as far as can be observed, is wrapped around the middle with a much-too-large mantle and therefore is probably meant to represent a child. The ages of figurines representing young males are important because they may illuminate the role of postpubescent youths and prepubescent boys in the sanctuary ritual. It is noteworthy that although there seem to be distinct age groups represented, the offerings they carry overlap in type. Of the Early Hellenistic youths, only ony e is preserved with anything in his hand, the rather ambiguous H302, who carries a bunch of grapes, as does the standing boy H319 and the seated girl H339. Other nude Early Hellenistic boys carry a strigil and pointed aryballos (H320), athletic equipment for which a child's body seems too young; a rooster (H322); or a bag for knucklebones429 (H323). Similar offerings are carried by the nude Classical youths: C188 carries an aryballos (albeit of different shape); C191 holds a rooster and perhaps a knucklebone bag; and the semidraped C201 carries a knucklebone bag and a ball. The Classical youths' offerings that are not found in this group of boys are the lyre and the phiale, which are not seen again. On the basis of the admittedly limited number of figurines in these groups, it would appear that the offerings once associated with youths have been transferred to younger boys. Perhaps it is not too farfetched to suggest that sometime during the later 4th century B.C. the role of prepubescent boys in the sanctuary ritual was enhanced, paralleling that of prepubescent girls (see pp. 126-127), although speaking in general terms, young children must have participated in rituals earlier.430 A purely artistic phenomenon, the interest of Hellenistic artists in genre subjects, could have been the impetus for the new types at this time. H323-H325 (and perhaps H326 in its complete state) are accompanied by a small dog. This image also continues from work in the Classical tradition, since one of the earlier seated children (C249) plays with a small dog. H319, a boy with grapes, takes a standing pose, but the figure is not static. The lower mantle folds swirl somewhat, and he seems restless, as if about to step forward. This pose is also 428 On determining the ages of representations of children on the basis of physical chacteristics such as chubbiness, convex profile, and proportions, see Sourvinou-Inwood 1988, pp. 37- 39; Canby 1986, pp. 56-57, 63, chart on p. 57, fig. 5-1; Hamilton 1992, pp. 209-219. 429 On knucklebone bags, see p. 63, note 272. 430 On children in festivals and cult in Classical Attica, see Ruhfel 1984a, pp. 77-174. On the importance of children in Eleusinian ritual, see Clinton 1992, p. 55. On one of the Pitsa plaques (pinax A) apparently prepubescent boys are musicians and lead the sacrificial sheep to the altar; the scene could represent a bridal sacrifice to the nymphs worshiped at Pitsa, since the young woman bearing the offering tray has shorn hair (EAA VI, 1965, pp. 201-202, pl. opp. p. 202, s.v. Pitsa [A. K. Orlandos]).</page><page sequence="213">DISCUSSION 189 characteristic of a smaller Boeotian figurine in Paris, which is similarly draped; the boy clutches the edge of the mantle in the right hand and carries a fruit in the left.431 In this case, because of the discrepancy in scale and the apparently better quality of the Corinthian figurine, the Boeotian coroplast may have used workshop materials imported from Corinth. The Boeotian figurine preserves the head, which has long, curly hair and a wreath, but it is not known whether the Corinthian figurine originally had a head of similar type. When Boeotian workshops borrowed the Corinthian ephedrismos type, they used only the torsos, adding their own head types (see p. 201), and the same practice could have been followed here. In another smaller boy figurine, probably Boeotian, formerly in the Bomford collection, the head is bare, and the figure is set at an angle on the base, enhancing the impression of motion.432 A connection also can be found with other Boeotian figurines, such as a boy from Tanagra,433 which is similar to H319 in the upper torso, including the draped, bent left arm, and also in the pose and contours of the left leg; the mantle is differently arranged at the right side, however, and the boy leans on a column and holds a knucklebone bag rather than grapes. The head of H319 also must have been different, since there are no traces on the shoulders of the long locks of hair of the Boeotian boy. This boy is smaller than H319 but only by a perhaps insignificant one centimeter, leaving the relationship between the two types unclear. What remains clear is that if the figurines of standing boys were more consistently preserved, one could probably show that a number of variant types were created from related source materials in an iconographic series (see pp. 14, 343), in either a Boeotian center or Corinth, the present evidence favoring the latter. The fragmentary H321 could be of a type similar to H3 19. Although its workmanship is not out of the ordinary, its fabric is excellent, much better prepared than that of any other figurine of a child. The torso fragment of a boy with a rooster (H322) indicates that figurines of boys of related type were made at a larger scale as well, although there is no evidence for mechanical continuity. There is a considerable drop in scale to the much smaller H323, again without demonstrable mechanical continuity. While we may simply be missing the material that would show how the types were altered from generation to generation, on the basis of the evidence at hand, it is probably best to assume that the archetypes were created separately at different scales. H320, a boy with an aryballos and strigil, shows a connection in pose with the youth H299. Although the proportions differ, showing a child on the one hand and a fully matured young man on the other, the poses are in mirror image, with a relaxed arm following the languid curve of the hip and the opposite leg stepping forward. The child figurine is larger in scale, and there is no observable mechanical relationship, but in the process of design of the archetypes, some related workshop materials may have been employed and adapted to represent children. A similar process is more clearly apparent for H331 (see p. 190). The smaller H324 and H325 are very close in pose to the youth H299. Two nude, standing boys (H326 and H327) are preserved with their heads. They are intermediate in scale between the larger and smaller groups just discussed, but in spite of general similarities, they do not provide evidence for mechanical continuity. The facial features are not very clear, but the faces are round and plump, although not as expressive as children's faces sometimes are; the hair is long at the sides, to the chin in H326, to the shoulder in H327, with the as-yet-uncut hair over the forehead arranged in a topknot or braid.434 Two additional heads with similar hairstyles (H328 and H329), preserved with part of the nude upper torso, probably belonged to similar types. If the head H330, which is quite like that of H327, also belonged to a standing nude boy, it would have been similar in scale to the largest of the boys (H322). 431 Louvre III, p. 32, no.

It represents a standing boy crowned with a stephane and wearing a small mantle over the left shoulder and around the hips (H331); he holds a small goose. The type differs distinctly from the other standing boys from the sanctuary not only in the headdress and drapery but also in its more slender proportions and more delicate detail. It cannot be grouped with any of the other figurines of children into an iconographic series (see pp. 14, 343), and it probably stemmed from a completely different source. Since the boy's lean, long-legged proportions are those of an adult rather than a child, the archetype probably was created in conjunction with adult figurine types. There are a few clues to help make the proper connections. The spool base of H331 also can be found in the votaries with piglet H1, H9, and H10. There is also a similarity of composition and theme with H9 and H10, in that both forearms are pressed to the torso, and an animal is held against the chest; in all three figurines, the stance is similar, with the left leg drawn to the side. All are of similar scale, taking into account that the child naturally would be smaller. The panel between the boy's parted legs is like that of the youth H299. Since there is a probable workshop relationship among the figurines of votaries and the youth (see pp. 119-120), it is likely that the boy H331 also should be brought into this group (Workshop H, see p. 346). The goose is most likely the chenalopex aegyptiaca (XrvaCXrnKTr), a small goose, rather like a duck, named by the 3rd-century author Herondas (Mimiamboi 4.31) as part of a sculptured group of a boy strangling a goose. While this quietly standing figurine can have no connection with the sculpture,435 such a design, if well known, could have prompted other renderings. Certainly the bird in H331 seems to be the proper size for a chenalopex, for which the modern designation is the alopochen aegyptiaca, a bird that had strong religious and erotic associations in Egypt.436 In Greece and Magna Graecia, the goose was sacred to both Kore and Aphrodite, although probably in its larger wild or domestic form.437 The largest assemblage of figurines of boys with ducks and geese is from the Phoenician site of Kharayeb.438 The types, both standing and seated, nude and draped, vary greatly and include some draped girls as well. None exactly parallels H331, which is, in any case, a local Corinthian creation. It is likely that the bird identified as a duck at Kharayeb is actually the chenalopex. The figurines are from afavissa connected with a fertility cult that invoked both Greek and Egyptian deities.439 It is perhaps significant that the Greek deities recognized at Kharayeb are Demeter and Kore, Dionysos, Aphrodite, and Eros, partly paralleling the pantheon of the Acrocorinth sanctuary. In both sanctuaries, other figurines of children carry balls or grapes or are accompanied by dogs. In addition to the thirteen figurines mechanically related to H331 enumerated in the catalogue, five fragments were counted in the lots. Most belong to the same generation, but probably one more followed. From elsewhere in Corinth, there are two unpublished examples, MF- 13901 and MF- 13907 from grave 1929-23, including a well-preserved head. Unfortunately the burial was disturbed. There is also an example of the head in an apparently Argive fabric (121), suggesting that molds of this type were exported. A poorly preserved example of slightly larger scale, with the mantle wrapped across the waist (H332), indicates another, perhaps earlier use of the type, although a mechanical relationship is not clearly demonstrable. 435 On the problem of reconciling the sculptural types show- ing a boy with a goose with the literary sources, see Bieber 1961, pp. 81-82; Pollitt 1986, pp. 140-141; Ridgway 1990, p. 232, with bibliography on p. 243, note 23.

These mantled boys, some of them wreathed, are quite different in type from the Acrocorinth sanctuary figurines, but it is possible that they also were dedicated to Demeter or Aphrodite.440 Yet another type is the seated, nude boy (H335-H338) unfortunately known in the Acro- corinth sanctuary only in fragments. With variants, the general scheme appears to have included at least some of the following features: a nude torso with plump, separated legs; drapery over one arm and falling over the edge of the seat; an offering, here a knucklebone bag, in one hand; and a blocklike seat, perhaps a chest. An unpublished headless example from grave 1929-23 (MF-13903) has no drapery but holds a bunch of grapes. The general type is not uncommon elsewhere, and better-preserved examples can be cited from Athens, for example.441 Paralleling the seated boys are two figurines of seated little girls (H339 and H340). H339, which is better in quality, represents a girl of about five years, dressed in a chiton, seated on a blocklike seat, and clutching a bunch of grapes. This type also was found in a Corinthian funerary context, in a North Cemetery grave dated to the first half of the 3rd century B.C. (see catalogue). The type originated in Athens and was widely copied; on the basis of decreasing size, four generations have been identified by Thompson.442 The Corinthian examples are comparable in size to the third generation, dated by Thompson to the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C. In the original type, the girl did not hold an offering, these additions having been made in the later generations.443 The head type, as seen in an example from Eleusis,444 shows a smiling face framed by a crop of curls, but none of the heads preserved in the Demeter sanctuary are really comparable. The more degenerate and slightly smaller seated girl (H340) may have been a local attempt to approximate the original type. It does not seem to be a mechanical relative because of its different anatomy and proportions. It has a head that is too large for the torso, even in a child's figure; since the head and torso were made in the same mold, this error must have been made in an earlier generation. Further, the head and torso are incongruous in type. The round face and coiffure with a braid or knot over the forehead and locks of hair down to chin level, like the hair of the boy H326, are those of a child, while the torso shows the small breasts of a maturing girl. The facial type of H340 is clearer in the similar, but larger head H341, which wears a thick, fillet-wrapped wreath.445 This head could have belonged to a figurine of either a girl or boy, since its hairstyle was unisex. The torso types of isolated heads of figurines of children are difficult to identify, even when their gender is known. Age is difficult to determine on the basis of the face alone, except in the case of babies or very young children, whose plump cheeks and widely opened eyes are unmistakable. Coiffures are somewhat helpful but cannot alone determine the iconographic context of a figurine of a child. A good example is the coiffure ofH342, which is summarily rendered but is identifiable as the melon coiffure with an encircling plait, as in the "doll's" head C136. Even this apparently feminine coiffure, known, for example, in a statue of a girl from Brauron,446 was also worn by boys, as in a bronze statuette in Baltimore.447 440 S. G.

H343 is a girl, but the arrangement of her long locks of hair is something like that of adult females, such as H186, with a narrow wreath instead of a stephane. H345 has a child's short neck and round, smiling face but wears her hair pulled up into a cluster of curls at the top of the head and long at the sides, a style known also in the Corinth collection in a figurine of a girl dancing448 and in heads of young women from the Demeter sanctuary (e.g., H230). A closely similar head was used for a figurine of Eros,449 but since there is no trace on H345 of the mirror Eros holds on his right shoulder, the subject is better identified as a child. H344 bears some resemblance to H178, the head of a draped young woman wearing a stephane, but the short neck, short curls, and more childish face of H344 suggest a younger girl; her headdress is a curious hybrid, formed like a low polos, but somewhat pointed at the center, like a stephane. The stephane when worn by children is sometimes placed low on the head, across the forehead, perhaps because a headdress made to encircle an adult's cranium would be too large to fit in the same way on a child's head. A stephane with a scroll pattern is worn in this fashion in one of the best renderings of a child's head from the Demeter sanctuary (H352), over the customary child's central braid and side curls. The gender of this child is uncertain, since the stephane, usually associated with goddesses or adult women, on the young is found in representations of both girls and boys.450 A head similar to this one in facial type and in the heavy-lidded, somewhat dreamy expression, but without the stephane, is found on a mold from the Athenian Agora, representing a nude boy.451 The Corinthian head, however, is larger than the Athenian mold and consequently cannot be derived from it. There is some flavor of the sculptures of children from Brauron in H352, and it is conceivable that there was some Attic connection, but neither its nature nor direction can at present be determined. The mold impression of H352 is fresh, the stephane was not added but was part of the original composition, and there is no sense that the piece was derivative, unlike the much duller Corinthian figurines that probably were mechanically copied from an Athenian source (e.g., the Asiatic dancer C281). A hint that a related type may have existed in Corinth at statuette scale is given by the head fragment H354. Only a portion of the scroll-patterned stephane and forehead are preserved, but the wisps of hair over the forehead are appropriate to a child's head and may approximate a coiffure like that of a terracotta statue of a boy from the Demeter sanctuary.452 Since the stephane widens slightly towards the viewer's left, and the strokes of the hair should slant towards the ear, the fragment probably belongs to the left temple of the head. In this head, the stephane was worn slightly back from rather than across the forehead. The face of a small head (H353), presumably a girl because she wears earrings, may be a later generation of H352. The coiffure could have a fringe of wispy bangs as in H354 but, in this case, the stephane has been replaced by a rather poorly rendered headdress somewhat resembling the feathered wreath found on some Attic figurines.453 One would think that the constraints placed upon coroplasts by the physiognomy of a child's face would limit the repertoire of types, but the remaining heads are all quite different from one another. H346 is similar in its wide nose and thick, wide lips to the Classical seated baby boy C237, but the addition of a wreath of leaves and perhaps clusters of berries suggests that the 448 MF-1018, Corinth XII, pp. 43-44, no. 248, pl. 21. 449 MF-9254, Romano 1994, p. 91, no. 79, pl. 28. 450 Riihfel 1984, p. 173, fig. 72 (girl); boys on Attic grave reliefs sometimes wear the stephane: Clairmont 1993, e.g., I, pp. 192-193, no. 0.873a. 451 D.

The hair, ears, and mouth were crudely retouched, while the eyes were allowed to retain the thick, nearly closed eyelids of a mold that apparently had lost definition of the facial features. The boy or girl H351 also has an exaggerated mouth but was made much better, with a child's alert, open-eyed expression, and well-modeled cheeks. The unidentifiable broken object on its head was perhaps a vessel. The earrings of the head H347 should identify it as a girl. A particularly well made and delicately detailed piece, it may be an earlier generation of the flying Eros H290. This workshop (Workshop E, see p. 345) appears to have produced a variety of child types of excellent quality. The head may have had a still earlier use with a curl-cluster coiffure, since the hair is swept up from the temples as in that hairstyle (see, e.g., H201). Further, leaf-shaped projections at either side of the head between the ears and the wreath could be the remaining ends of curls tumbling from a cluster of curls, the main part of which was removed when the wreath was applied. The head of a baby boy or girl H348 has particular charm, since its too-large wreath has settled at an angle over the typical child's front-plaited coiffure. The composition is particularly nice, the head tilting to the side opposite the slant of the wreath. The details of its good workmanship suggest that this head also may have been made in the same workshop as H347 and the flying Eros H290; because of the technical and stylistic similarities, there is a chance that H348 represents Eros as well. A mold for a larger wreathed child's head was found in Corinth in the excavations East of the Theater (MF-1988-25, PI. 76); it too is well designed, although there is no evidence of a mechanical relationship. H349, the mantled head of an alert, sweetly smiling child, also could represent Eros, who is shown veiled and flying in a 3rd-century B.C. type from Asia Minor.456 Whether Eros or a mortal child, the face resembles that of a sculpture in the Liebieghaus-Museum.457 The last head (H350) is of still another type. Its very small, smiling mouth, set in puffy cheeks, gives the face a puckish expression. The hair is an unusually (for a child) large mass of punched curls framing the face; the upper layer of curls could originally have been a wreath, misunderstood by the coroplast and retouched like hair. Similarly punched curls are found on the youth's head H317. A possible mold sibling has the more common child's central plait (see catalogue). The attributes associated with figurines of children probably have some reference to the cult. Since the bunches of grapes carried by one boy and one girl probably should be construed as offerings, like a terracotta cluster of grapes from the sanctuary,458 it is likely that the toys and animals carried by others are also offerings and not merely attributes of childhood. Apart from the bunches of grapes, the items include knucklebone bags, a strigil and aryballos, a small goose, and a rooster, all carried by boys. The dog accompanies boys, but as it is not carried, is not likely to have been an offering. Coiffures and headdresses (the stephane and wreath) appear to be unisex. Wreaths are associated with banqueting and festivals,459 but when worn by children, only the latter context would apply. 454 The baby Dionysos is represented on Apulian red-figured pottery wearing a wreath of leaves: LIMC III, 1986, pp. 478- 479, no. 667, pl. 376, s.v. Dionysos (C. Gasparri). 455 For a group of this type attributed to Corinth, see Louvre III, p. 53, no.

The child is surely much younger than the five to eight years suggested in the publication, since the hair has not yet grown long enough for the customary central plait. 458 MF- 11303, publication forthcoming with miscellaneous finds. 459 Troy, p. 46. On the symbolic significance of wreaths, see Goodenough 1958, VII, pp. 154-161.</page><page sequence="218">194 EARLY HELLENISTIC FIGURINES AND THEIR SURVIVALS The grapes immediately suggest a reference to Dionysos460 and remind one of the Athenian Anthesteria festival, in which small children may have played a role; there, grapes are thought to have had the same symbolic reference for children as wine had for adults.461 The offering of clusters of grapes to other deities connected with the sanctuary, however, particularly Aphrodite and the nymphs, is also documented (Anthologia Palatina 6.190, 191, 299, 300, 324). Eros himself carries a bunch of grapes in an Attic figurine.462 The offering of knucklebones could parallel the offering of a ball (see p. 126) as a toy of childhood. Hermes receives such gifts from a boy in Anthologia Palatina 6.309, but exactly who received them in the Acrocorinth sanctuary is unclear. The strigil and oil bottle could perhaps be similarly construed as an offering, although of youths rather than boys. The goose was associated with both Kore and Aphrodite;463 the rooster, a symbol of male sexuality, was offered to Kore.464 The possibly chthonic reference of the pet dog has been mentioned above (p. 73). Although the material is not sufficiently abundant to draw firm conclusions, the themes that emerge are the giving away of objects associated with childhood or youth, growing maturity as seen through the nudity of some of the boys, and references to fertility. What is important is that children are represented participating in ritual, which was not the case with the Classical figurines of children. One thinks of Plato's description of children learning about the gods by observing their parents worshiping at festivals (Laws 10.887d).465 But beyond this, the boys are nude, a state that is taken as a sign of initiation ritual for youths (see p. 61). While the boys are surely too young to be undergoing any ritual preparing them for marriage, their connection with the symbols of sexual maturity and fertility at an early age could parallel the apparent early socialization of girls through cult activity of some kind (see p. 127). Most of the Early Hellenistic figurines of children are, unfortunately, from mixed contexts. Those with some contextual evidence for date are the following: H320 and H339 are from pottery contexts terminating in the late 4th century B.C.; from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., are H347 and a mold sibling of H326; H346 and H352 are from pottery contexts terminating in the early 3rd century B.C.; H353 is from a pottery context terminating in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C.; H322, H350, and H354 are from pottery contexts terminating in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C.; from pottery contexts terminating in the later 3rd century are H328, H329, and H349. Although the numerous fragments of the boy with a goose (H331) are from mixed contexts, the absence of the type among the more than 1,800 figurine fragments in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building suggests that it was not created before the 3rd century B.C.466 Indeed, the slender proportions and delicacy of the type are consonant with an early-3rd-century B.C. date. COMIC ACTORS, PARODIES, AND GROTESQUES (H355-H384) Figurines of three separate categories are brought together here for discussion because of their common use of masks or anatomical distortions. Painting or modeling comically misshapen figures was a tradition in Corinth going back to the Archaic period, the best-known examples being the so-called padded dancers of Archaic vase painting.467 Corinthian figurine types falling into this general category include grotesquely distorted figures of nude women (e.g., H373), three- legged satyrs (e.g., C275), semihuman monkeys depicted in everyday activities (e.g., V8), parodies 460 On the symbolism of the vine, wine, and grapes, see Goodenough 1956, VI, pp. 46-60. 461 R.

Although terracotta models of theatrical masks were dedicated at the sanctuary,468 it should be noted that the wearing of a mask by a figurine does not necessarily make it a theatrical type, since masking in the theater ultimately derived from that practice in ritual.469 COMIC ACTORS AND PARODIES The comic actor figurines from the Demeter sanctuary are of two sorts: one group follows Athenian comic actors in type and style (e.g., H355), and reflects the literary comedy of Athens; a second group may refer instead to local, nonliterary comic performances. While very little is known of the Doric farce of the Peloponnesos, this ancient comic form, apparently consisting of humorous skits rather than full-length plays, is sometimes considered a forerunner of Attic comedy, and the "padded dancers" are cited as visual proof of these performances. Among their varied associations, these dancers appear on Corinthian vases in scenes identified as women's festivals.470 Whether or not these scenes have anything to do with the rituals of the Sanctuary of Demeter, the connection of comic types in Corinth with women's worship clarifies the appearance of comic figurines in the sanctuary. Certainly buffoonery and coarse humor were associated with the cult of Demeter.471 Indeed, the very origins of comedy are traced by some to fertility rituals.472 Figurines of actors, mainly Attic, have been studied comprehensively, with attempts to connect them to characters in specific plays.473 One imported Athenian comic actor (142) was found in the Demeter sanctuary; in addition, some of the actors of local manufacture are either copies or adaptations of known Athenian types representing Old and Middle Comedy. H355 is one of these; the figurine represents an actor, standing or seated, who holds upright beside his head a baby wearing a pilos.474 Others are H356, the masked head of an actor of unknown type; H357-H359, comic actors dressed as a pregnant bride unveiling, a type dated 350-325 B.C. by Webster;475 and H360 and H361, actors portraying a pregnant, mantled woman muffled to the eyes like a bride.476 One of this group (H361) is sufficiently similar to its Attic parallels477 in its peaked coiffure and fold patterns to suggest a mechanical relationship; indeed, one of the known Attic examples is of reported Corinthian provenience,478 indicating that an imported figurine could have been available for copying. H360 is of a type similar to H361, but it is slightly larger and is not mechanically related; it is less slender and has a rounded rather than peaked coiffure. The small and summarily worked H362, which has lost all its molded detail, could be a derivative of a type similar to H360. This group is dated 400-375 B.C. by Webster. H363 may be a variant of the actor as an old nurse, with one arm pulling the mantle to the chin, the other holding a baby; this type is also dated 400-375 B.C. by Webster.479 The face, however, is not necessarily a mask, being without the gaping mouth and showing realistically sagging cheeks. Since the impression is very dull, however, and the composition closely resembles the theatrical type, it is probably best to consider this figurine an actor. It may be dull because its mold was taken directly from an imported figurine and was not retouched. 468 Publication forthcoming with miscellaneous finds. 469 Burkert 1985, pp. 103-104, with bibliography; see J. B. Carter 1988, on the connection of masks with ritual marriage and girls' initiation ritual; also J. B.

It is perhaps more to the point that the types chosen consist of comic kourotrophoi and pregnant brides,481 that is, types that refer to the same concerns of visitors to this sanctuary as do other figurines. The actual attributes of these figurines may have been more important to the purchasers than their literary identity. H364, representing Silenos with the infant Dionysos, is a copy of an Attic type that is thought to refer to Satyric drama; the details of the type are clear in an example in the Corinth collection (MF-1608) and a larger one in London (see catalogue). The impression of H364 is very dull, perhaps because its mold was taken directly from an imported figurine and not retouched, as may also be true of the old nurse H363. The subject is also known in a much larger rendering in Paris, of reported Corinthian provenience.482 The remaining figurines in this group, a few of which are masked, cannot be directly connected to the Attic literary tradition but could instead refer to local traditional comic performances, which would not have been out of place in this cult. It is noteworthy that the types, although varied, are all female. The miniature H365 is a masked actor in the garb and pose of a mantled dancer, similar to H153. There is a later generation of H365 (see below) as well as another miniature dancer type, less well preserved but probably also masked (H366), suggesting that these types were fairly popular. If the figurines from the sanctuary representing mantled dancers (H153-H172) point to dancing of this kind as part of the ritual, then the masked dancer figurines could suggest that such dances also were parodied, with humorous intention. These masked miniatures may have been made in the same workshop (Workshop C, see p. 345) as the serious miniature dancers H165 and H166. Like them, H365 shows the swirling drapery typical of the late 5th and early 4th centuries B.C., together with slight torsion, which calls for a date somewhat later in the 4th century B.C. A probable later generation in the Corinth collection was found in the Forum area in a cistern abandoned at the end of the third or beginning of the fourth quarter of the 4th century B.c.483 Another point of similarity with the serious dancers is the sharp detail in miniature scale, suggesting derivation from a small metal figure (see p. 155). H367, a miniature masked hydriaphoros, is another possible workshop mate. It too could represent deliberate parody of a serious sanctuary ritual, if the hydriaphoros figurines found there point to the actual cultic carrying of water jars (see p. 38). Attic comic water carriers do exist484 but are masked and dressed as actors, while H367 is garbed as a woman. The remaining figurines have the anatomical exaggerations appropriate to actors but do not preserve the heads to prove the presence of theatrical masks. The possibility exists that some of these figurines are parodies, if not of rituals, then of the serious iconography found among the other figurines, rather than depictions of actors playing roles. Certainly the nude or virtually nude female types mentioned below cannot be actors. Only the discovery of better-preserved examples of this group can clarify their identification. A liking for parody already can be found in the Classical seated goddess C81. Two members of this group (H368 and H369) may parody peplophoros types. H368 is a corpulent, probably pregnant woman in a vulgar, straddling pose. This figurine actually could be of Classical date. It is from a surface lot with material of all periods, but it has regular, parallel folds on the skirt and overfold, and a wide, splaying, slightly inturned foot recalling the deformed feet of the seated goddess C81, which is from a 480 On performances in Corinth, see Anderson 1986, pp. 46-47. 481 A figurine ascribed to Corinth (Winter, Typen II, p. 421, no. 10), also mantled and pregnant, wears the long hair and topknot of a young girl. In this version as well, the joke seems to be the too-late wedding. 482 Louvre III, p. 53, no. D295, pl. 61 :e; at present, finds from Corinth cannot confirm the origin of this figurine. 483 MF-1979-37, C. K. Williams 1979a, p. 125, pl. 30:d. 484 Webster 1978, pp. 50-51, no. AT 14.</page><page sequence="221">DISCUSSION 197 pottery context terminating in the 5th century B.C. With its long, pleated overfold, it could be parodying such a type as the Classical peplos-figurine C16. H369 wears a peplos and probably a shoulder-pinned back mantle, the lappets of which can barely be discerned in front, but the low kolpos is pouched in the front and back in such a way as to give the appearance of a distended abdomen and buttocks. This figurine could parody a goddess type, such as the peplos-figurine with shoulder-pinned back mantle C36. Only the back of H370 is preserved, but the wide, massive buttocks are sufficient to identify it as a corpulent comic type; the costume is feminine, the mantle just covering the hips, as in H360. The full width of H371 is not preserved, but the figurine appears to have been wide and squat in proportions, although not as exaggerated as H370. Its enveloping mantle calls to mind a type such as H1 10. H372 is the front of a squat, massive figure, with a diagonally rolled mantle like that of H130. H373 is a nude female figure with a swollen abdomen, composed like figurines of Aphrodite (cf. H266) but pregnant. A similarly shaped nude articulated "doll" (C115), discussed with that group (see p. 53), may also be a parody of a serious type. Grotesquely corpulent, nude female figures signified fertility in Egyptian art,485 and it is likely that figurines of this kind from the Demeter sanctuary should be similarly interpreted. Obese, nude female figurines sometimes caricatured serious sculptural representations of Aphrodite.486 A parodied Aphrodite Anadyomene has been found at Corinth,487 but, as far as H373 is preserved, the pose, with the right hip outthrust and the left thigh forward, resembles that of the Knidia. A more exaggeratedly obese nude female figurine from the Athenian Agora is an accurate rendering of a pathological condition and has been identified as an old courtesan.488 There are, however, no parallels to the Athenian woman among the figurines from the Demeter sanctuary, which are best identified as parodies. The Corinthian examples either are vulgarly misshapen, as are H368 and H370, or have swollen abdomens without any other significant anatomical distortion, which should indicate pregnancy. H374 seems to be a parody of Late Classical transparent drapery, as in C174, that here reveals legs like stumps and oversized breasts. Like H368, this figurine has wide, splaying feet as well as a drapery style that could point to a Classical date. In the wonderfully comic erotic group H376, a sleeping old man is receiving the attentions of an old, nude woman; she seems to be masked, but his open mouth may indicate a snore rather than a comic mask. This figurine must be a parody of serious erotic symplegma types. To cite a coroplastic example, a mold from Smyrna in Paris is dated to the Late Hellenistic period but has a couch similar to H376.489 A somewhat similar parodic intention may be seen in an Attic Totenmahl with a maenad and Silenos on the couch.490 H375 is either a head of such dismal quality that it is virtually a caricature or a parody of the goddess wearing a crenellated polos (see C100). If the Corinthian coroplasts were indeed parodying the rituals and deities of the cult, and if the worshipers were offering the figurines in that light, then this irreverence must have been as acceptable to the Corinthian public as Aristophanes' was to the Athenian. The reason for their acceptance was probably the apotropaic sense in which buffoonery, the grotesque, and the obscene were understood.49 Only a few of the foregoing actor and parody figurines come from useful pottery contexts.

From contextual evidence, therefore, all the datable figurines of this group date not later than the 4th century B.C. or perhaps the beginning of the 3rd. There is no reason to suggest that any of the others would be later than that. Some probably were made in the Potters' Quarter workshops, where molds of generally similar types were found;493 for these the terminus ante quem would be the destruction of the Potters' Quarter in the 320s B.C. It is notable, however, that while humorous and grotesque types were produced at the Potters' Quarter, there are few really close parallels with the comparable figurines from the Demeter sanctuary. GROTESQUES The tiny female figure H377 appears to perch at the end of a couch, presumably of a banqueter. Legs dangling and wearing a grinning mask, this figure has a somewhat demonic quality. By comparison with the slightly larger although less clearly modeled H378, the cylindrical objects in the hands of H377 resolve themselves into a snake, a not uncommon attribute of banqueters (see p. 67). One might identify these figures as the female companions often seated at the feet of banqueters; such small seated women are found among Tarentine banqueters.494 The mask of H377, however, and the protrusions on the backs of both figures that may be the remains of wings, separate them from the usual banqueter type. A good parallel for a winged female figure in a banqueting scene is an infernal deity who sits at the feet of the reclining man on an Etruscan sarcophagus lid.495 In Greek art, the figures of Sleep and Death are winged, but they are male.496 The eidolon of the deceased is depicted as a small, often winged replica of the person,497 but it is hard to connect this concept with banqueters, who themselves are thought to represent the heroized dead and are usually male. In any case, the snakes in the laps of H377 and H378 suggest that they do have a funerary connotation. Three grotesque heads (H379-H381) wear masks that differ from one another as well as from theatrical types. Since they are short haired or bald, they must represent men (although H379 has holes in the ears, which may have contained earrings); since the faces are beardless, the heads presumably represent youths. H380 preserves one bare shoulder and was therefore nude or semidraped. H379 is a caricature of an almost believable human face with a very low forehead, large nose, and receding chin. Its most striking elements are the large, projecting ears, which call to mind a mask in the Corinth collection with such ears, although a much different facial type.498 H380 is more humorous and engaging, and with its uptilted face and open smile, it could almost be a parody of a figurine of a small child, such as the baby Eros H290. Its unusually thin neck is not that of a baby, however, and it has prominent ears, almost like those of a mouse, an exaggeratedly snub nose, and a wide mouth resembling a mask. H381 is the most distinctly animal-like of the three, with ears near the top of the flattened cranium and a prognathous jaw. Both H379 and H381 are faintly menacing or at least not really humorous. The precise uses of masks of this kind in Corinth is not known, but an Attic red-figured vase in 492 Webster 1978, p. 125. 493 Corinth XV, i, pp. 102-103, nos. 43-49, pls. 35, 36. 494 E.g., Iacobone 1988, p. 74, pl. 66:b.

H383 probably represents a boy, since the hair is combed forward into a fringe on the forehead, as in a terracotta sculpture of a boy from the sanctuary.500 The cranium is unusually high and narrow, resulting in a conical shape that is found also in a grotesque head from the Theban Kabeirion.501 The Boeotian head is similar in the shape of the skull, the high ears, the combed-down hair, the grin, and the squinting eyes, but it is bearded, with a broader face, thicker lips, and shorter, flatter nose. A similar head type is known also at Gela, where it is said to be common, on a mantled type dated to the second half of the 4th century B.C., from a small cult building thought to have belonged to Demeter or a local deity assimilated to her.502 H383 is from a pottery context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C. H382 has a bit of the neck preserved, showing that the head was thrust forward on the chest. The head could have belonged to a figurine of a humpbacked dwarf, similar in type to a figurine of unknown provenience in Boston.503 The facial features are comparable: the wide, thick-lipped mouth, bulbous nose, and frowning brows. The Boston dwarf carries a bunch of grapes, as do two of the figurines of children from the Demeter sanctuary. A head mold from the Potters' Quarter is comparable in the thick lips, wide nose, and pained expression;504 while it produced a related dwarf type, it is not mechanically related to H382. The dedication of a dwarf figurine at the Demeter sanctuary could be explained by the connection of dwarfs with sexual potency505 or by their association in Greek art with Dionysos,506 who also was worshiped at the sanctuary. The representation of medical pathologies in Hellenistic terracotta figurines is well known, but most examples, such as those from Smyrna, are later in date and of a more dramatically grotesque appearance.507 H382 is from a pottery context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C. H384 seems to have been made from a child's head, to judge from the outline of its coiffure. The plait at the top of the head and the locks of hair just reaching chin level at the sides, like those of H329, are still visible in spite of the drastic manipulation of the face that has given it an almost birdlike appearance. SILENOS AND PAN (H385-H387) The varied satyr types of the Classical period (C274-C276) were replaced in Hellenistic times by representations of Silenos. As in the case of the satyrs, figurines of Silenos can be accounted for in this sanctuary through reference to Dionysos, who appears to have received offerings there (see p. 76). Pan reappears in the sanctuary in the Hellenistic period but is conceived entirely differently from his Classical form, in fully human rather than partly animal shape. H385 is a nude Silenos, with legs spread on a blocklike seat and wearing a mantle over his arm, in a pose resembling that of the seated boys H335-H337. In fact, were it not for the remains of a beard on his chest, the corpulence of this figurine could be taken for the soft physique of a child. H386, also seated, is differently composed. The snub-nosed, bearded face and fleshy torso identify the figurine as Silenos, but the pilos on his head and the capelike mantle around his shoulders signify a shepherd. The rocky base on which he sits emphasizes the outdoor location. 499 Bieber 1961a, pp. 42-43, fig. 180, with bibliography; the dance is probably not the kordax of Attic comedy, as identified; see RE XI, 2, 1922, col. 1385, s.v. kordax (B.

The same stylistic qualities are found in H288, which also may represent Pan. OTHER TYPES (H388-H394) PROTOME (H388) The backless protome H388 differs markedly from the Classical variety (cf. C251), which in its complete form included the shoulders and upper chest. H388 ends at the collarbones, perhaps through the influence of thymiateria such as C261, which terminated just a little below the base of the neck. It is unfortunate that most of the head is missing, since the large eyes and rays of hair waving away from the face must have been striking in effect. Although the dramatic style might suggest a Middle Hellenistic date, the protome was found in a 4th-century B.C. pottery context. OLD WOMAN (H389) The small head of an old woman H389 deserves its own separate discussion because it is a remarkable rendering of its subject at such small scale. This figurine is not in any way a caricature, as the theatrical types representing old people often are, but a highly sympathetic, although truthful, representation of an age-ravaged face. A similar artistic attitude can be found in a mold of an old man's head from the Potters' Quarter.51 The artist's means were very simple, hollowing the eye sockets and cheeks of a strongly shaped, oblong face, drawing the mouth as a wide slash without lips to show the loss of teeth, and furrowing the forehead. Attention was paid to showing the sinews of the neck as they appear in an older person, straining a little, as if the face were raised.512 It is possible that the figure was stooped and looking up, like the composition of a late-4th-century B.C. Boeotian figurine of a mantled old woman in Oxford, although the face is different.513 The old woman could be identified simply as a genre type, or she may represent Demeter in disguise searching for her daughter, but perhaps the most likely possibility in the context of the sanctuary is that she represents a priestess. Old priestesses played a specific role in the Demeter ritual at Hermione (Pausanias 2.35.6-8).514 H389 was associated with pottery of the late 4th century B.C. On the basis of the quality of workmanship, a 4th-century B.C. date is likely. EPHEDRISMOS GROUPS (H390-H394) The type here discussed has been linked with a game called "ephedrismos," described by Pollux (Onomastikon 9.118-119). The game required the players to throw a ball at a stone to try to 508 On the connection between Silenos and Pan, see Bor- geaud 1988, p. 220, note 4. 509 Pan is represented in a similar pose, with human legs crossed at the ankles and with horns at the center of his forehead, in Apulian red-figured pottery: Schauenburg 1962, p. 30, no. 49, pl. 14:1; for Pan in his human form in Corinthian sculpture, see Ridgway 1981, p. 428, note 23 (S-2690). 510 MF-9259 in the Corinth collection (Romano 1994, p. 94, no. 95, pl. 29) is a small fragment showing the syrinx and the right arm in a higher position, demonstrating that another version of this type was made in Corinth as well; this figurine may not be an import, as suggested in the publication. 511 KH-24, Corinth XV, i, pp. 96-97, no. 26, pl. 33. 512 In spirit, cf.

If properly identified, the game, played by boys, girls, erotes, or satyrs, can be seen in Greek art from the Classical to the Hellenistic periods, in a number of variants (some without blindfolding, some with a ball) and in different media, including sculpture.515 The type was popular for terracotta figurines in Boeotia and the West as well as Corinth. The closest similarities are with Boeotian figurines, but since the Corinthian examples are larger and better made, the archetypes may have been developed there, spreading later to Boeotian workshops, which used the torsos but added their own head types.516 The West Greek variants are mainly Middle Hellenistic in date.517 Corinthian coroplasts produced two versions, a larger one in which runner and rider moved to the viewer's right, with complete examples in Berlin and Amsterdam,518 and a smaller one moving to the left, with a complete example in Boston.519 Both versions show variations in the angle at which the rider is mounted, in the position of her arms, and in the head types employed. Five fragments from the Demeter sanctuary seem to belong to the Boston type. H390, preserving the left legs of both runner and rider, is the largest in scale of this group, and is well crafted of excellent fabric, with finely detailed folds. The drapery, transparent over the legs and frothing into omega folds at the hems, approximates Attic Rich Style. The Boston figurine, probably from the same or a related mold series, is later by more than one generation and has lost detail, including the double hem of the rider. H391 probably preserves the upper torso of the rider, with a little of the back of the runner adhering to the front. It too is larger than the Boston figurine, and the composition must have been somewhat different, since the right shoulder is raised, giving the pose more tension. The plump, short-waisted proportions are comparable to draped female figurines such as H152. The head type is unknown, but long locks of hair in back give some hint of the coiffure. H392 is another torso, less certainly from an ephedrismos group, but it has broken away from something in the front, and the V-shaped fold pattern of the bodice is right for this type. H393 and H394 are smaller in scale and are also uncertain. Both preserve the right foot and lower leg of a runner moving to the viewer's left and are suitably shallow in composition as far as preserved; H394 has the typical frothy drapery with omega folds at the hem.520 Two pieces in this group (H391 and H394) were found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the pottery of which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. A stylistic date for the archetype probably in the first half of the 4th century B.C. is indicated by the drapery style of H390. The dedication in the sanctuary of figurines representing ephedrismos may perhaps be explained by the religious associations of ball games, particularly in the cult of Aphrodite.521 One cannot suppose, on the basis of such limited evidence, that ball games were played at the sanctuary, but figurines of a boy and girls holding balls were offered as votives (see pp. 63, 125-126), and the association of play with a cult that in part focused on young people is plausible.522 515 On the game, see Schmidt 1977, pp. 129-138.

Eyes downturned, right eye lower than left; upper lids well defined, lower lids lifted, puffy. Nose bulbous, close to upper lip. Lips thin. Straight locks of hair fall to shoulders from central part; bound with fillet. Pellet earring preserved on left ear. Seems to be a degenerate version of preceding long-haired votary types but is larger than these figurines and is without close parallels in facial type. Seep. 130.

Torso similar in type to H56, with mantle better preserved. Drapery folds framing right breast continue in a swag across waist, originally must have been draped over extended left forearm. Another group of folds curves from the right shoulder, across the upper chest and down to the left elbow, framing the left breast. A few folds of peplos visible at left shoulder. Back has less detail than H56. Proportions of figure seem ample, even matronly, beneath heavy drapery, in contrast to small head and youthful face. Head tilted forward. Face oblong to oval, with high forehead; dimpled chin. Eyes small, downturned; lids fleshy, lower lids puffy; browridge rounded. Nose wide, long, close to upper lip.

Mantle is draped heavily over both shoulders and left upper arm, forms a short cape on right upper arm. On right side, folds lie in two layers, each with a different diagonal orientation. Folds below missing right arm swing out to side, may belong to peplos overfold. Possibly similar in type to H56 and H57 but with added drapery.

Right arm originally extended to side. Proportions are matronly, with full breasts, short waist. Deep V-shaped folds form peplos neckline; looped folds at right side seem to be excess cloth of peplos bunched up and tucked into mantle roll at waist. One end of mantle is wrapped closely over left breast; remainder of cloth is draped around back, rolled at waist in front, and then draped over left shoulder from back to front. Seep. 135.

Marks of finely toothed tool over surface, especially thighs. Published: Coroplast's Art, p. 56, fig. 42. Weight on left leg, left hip slightly outthrust. Right leg bent, foot drawn back slightly. Left arm hidden beneath drapery but probably bent, elbow pulled slightly back, hand on hip. Right upper arm extended to side and lifted. Tilt of neck to right suggests that head originally was turned in that direction. Only garment is a mantle, its upper edge stretched tightly around breasts, under right arm, and over left shoulder, from which it falls to hem in panel of wide, vertical folds, opening into diamond-shaped pleat near bottom. In contrast, cloth clings closely to torso and legs, with only a few curved ridges from right armpit to abdomen, and from left thigh and knee to right ankle. Hem trails slightly over slippered feet. Legs short, thighs heavy. Breasts small, prominent, slightly displaced to left side (perhaps clumsy attempt at torsion); right breast slightly lower than left. Similar in stocky proportions to H76. Missing base probably was rectangular in shape to accommodate drapery fall. See pp. 14, 17, 135-136, 137, 138, 168, 275. H66 Standing draped female figurine (Aphrodite?) P1. 29 MF-14071. Lot 2163.

Back handmade, flattened. Left arm bent. Stretched folds of mantle (at upper break) probably originated at right armpit. Single downward-curving fold takes up slack of cloth above elbow. Edge of mantle drops from elbow in three wide, flat, vertical pleats, each one divided by a vertical groove. Mantle continues down side from beneath this overhang of cloth. Probable mold sibling: MF-3396 in the Corinth collection (Corinth XII, p. 44, no. 256, pl. 22, more complete but heavily retouched, there dated too late, perhaps because of crude retouch; H66 is a better impression, folds rendered in mold rather than tooled).

Weight on right leg, right hip outthrust. Left leg bent, slightly advanced. Both arms bent, elbows pulled back. Right hand rests flat on hip. Left hand also at hip but covered by mantle. Torso wrapped closely in mantle; upper edge folded down and draped from right armpit to left shoulder, from which cloth falls in heavy panel, almost to ankle. Other end of mantle arranged in sling under right arm and draped over head. Arrowhead folds curve diagonally across chest from left shoulder; looped fold frames right breast. Other folds slant from left hip to abdomen or drop in a series of loops to right lower leg. Cloth smooth over thighs.

The factor that distinguishes this discussion from the foregoing is the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C., which means that no Middle Hellenistic types could survive into the Late Hellenistic period, resulting in a diminished total. Although the nature of the site and particularly the lack of chronologically useful stratigraphy make it difficult to determine exactly when many of the figurines were dedicated, it is likely that descendants of some of the Early Hellenistic creations discussed above were still being dedicated after the middle of the 3rd century B.C. For example, in lot 3217, the contents of which appear to have been discarded in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.c.,l one finds a small number of good pieces of clear 4th-century B.C. date, but the latest material consists of degenerate survivals of 4th- or early-3rd-century B.C. types. This situation would parallel the continued use of Classical types through the 4th century, beside the newer Early Hellenistic creations (see p. 115). Creativity appears to have revived in the last quarter of the 3rd century B.C., when a major new type was invented, the "priestess" (see H395-H411). At that time there is stylistic evidence for the influence of the Greek East, which had had more impact on Corinthian coroplastic work in the Archaic period than in Classical and Early Hellenistic times. Renewal can also be seen in the return of high technical quality, as in the head H427, and in the large scale of many pieces. There is evidence for some habitation of Corinth between 146 B.C. and the establishment of the Roman colony in 44 B.c.,2 but very little evidence exists for activity at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore.3 There is as yet no evidence for local coroplastic activity during this interim period; indeed, if the larger sanctuaries requiring votives were not active, there would have been little work for coroplasts. There may be some evidence for the importation of figurines at this time, but it is not yet confirmed.4 1 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 101-103. 2 Most recently on this subject, Romano 1994, pp. 62-64, with bibliography. 3 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 2, 4; Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 434. 4 Romano (1994, pp. 90-94) publishes 21 figurines from deposit 1947-3. This deposit is important because it includes ceramic evidence for activity during the first half of the in- terim period 146-44 B.C. The question is whether the figurines also provide evidence for such activity, and in this regard, un- fortunately, the article must be used with caution. Of the 21 figurines catalogued, only 4 are identified as Corinthian and therefore manufactured before 146 B.C. Of the remainder, 7 are called imports or possible imports, and the Corinthian origin of the remaining 10 figurines is questioned. There is no summarizing discussion of the figurines as evidence apart from the catalogue. No criteria are presented for the determination of origin. The fabric descriptions of some of the pieces sound Corinthian, even while their origin is questioned, sometimes simply because they lack typological parallels in Corinth. The present study, however, should show that this means nothing, since the prolific Corinthian coroplastic industry always pro- duced many different types and variants, some of which are known in only one example or wait a long while before an- other is found. Probably unintentionally, the impression is created that all but 4 of these figurines are or could be imports, an unusually large proportion for a Corinthian deposit. The identification of imports in this deposit is an important mat- ter, since the importation of figurines (and those of quite good quality) would imply a degree of prosperity, and the existence of the contexts in which figurines were used, i.e., open sanctu- aries with enough organization to hold festivals, dwellings nice enough to be decorated, and graves wealthy enough to hold more than the most basic offerings. To make proper use of the coroplastic material in this deposit, the figurines should first be tested for provenience. Then, for those that are definitely not Corinthian, evidence should be sought to determine their origin and whether they really can be dated between 146 and 111 B.C., the date suggested for the closure of this deposit. Since</page><page sequence="274">250 MIDDLE HELLENISTIC FIGURINES DRAPED FEMALE FIGURINES AND RELATED HEADS (H395-H424) THE "PRIESTESS" TYPE (H395-H411) This type was quite popular, with a total of about 175 fragmentary figurines surviving, including pieces mentioned in the catalogue and others counted in the lots. The size range is considerable, from size 2-3 up to statuette scale. Whether it represents a priestess or a goddess is not entirely clear; this question will be discussed further, but the name "priestess" is in any case a convenient designation to distinguish this type from others. The type has two variants, both produced in a range of quality from good to poor, in both molding and fabric. The first variant is not fully preserved in any one example, but can be reconstructed from three fragmentary figurines. The first is H395, which preserves the type from the head to the hips. It represents a standing female figure, wearing a V-necked peplos on top of a chiton, only the sleeves of which are visible; round buttons5 fasten the peplos at the shoulders. The coiffure has a central part, a long lock of hair outlining each shoulder and a single thick braid falling down the back; this is a Classicizing motif, recalling the coiffure of the Erechtheion caryatids.6 On the head is a polos with torus borders at the top and bottom. The pleasant face, with its short nose and crooked smile, does not quite match any of the others, but it is nevertheless within the stylistic parameters of Corinthian Hellenistic facial types. A blister at the right eye indicates the use of a plaster mold. The "priestess" cradles a piglet in her right arm and in her left supports a short, thick, conical torch with a large flame blowing away from her head but still unrealistically close to her hair.7 The second fragmentary figurine used to reconstruct this type is H397, which can be identified by the torch and piglet, although the torch is slanted closer to the shoulder. It preserves the torso down to the thigh, including the peplos overfold, which hangs, in a rather Classicizing manner, in narrow parallel folds terminating at the center of the hem in an omega (almost butterfly) fold and at the side in eye folds.8 This pattern also is found on the overfold hem of the third fragmentary figurine used to reconstruct this type (H396), which is larger in scale and preserves the type from the hips (including the left hand holding the bottom of the torch) to the base. The skirt hem trails over the insteps of shoes with indented soles and makes a gradual, smooth transition to the edge of the low base. The state of preservation of these three fragments precludes a determination of mechanical relationship, but they should belong to the same type. H398 and H400 appear to be a later generation of H395; the torch slants slightly toward the head of H398 (although not as much as in H397) and was never separated from the side of the head after molding. A decline in craftsmanship is evident not only in this shortcut but also in the extremely dull and unretouched impression of H398 and the poor fabric of H400. The smaller H399, which is of extremely coarse although probably local fabric, is nearly featureless; it has a torch flame virtually springing from the cheek and represents the nadir of craftsmanship in the first variant of the "priestess" type. The type, from head to base, was complete in the front mold, with very little retouch; the back was also molded. The polos is flat in back, but its fully rounded contours in other "priestesses" (e.g., H405) show that the intended headdress was indeed a polos. The technique of including all elements, including the base, in a single front mold, and molding rather than hand modeling in all periods Corinth imported a small number of figurines, those that could date before 146 B.C. would not be relevant. The figurines in this deposit could tell either a great deal or nothing at all. 5 On buttons as fasteners, see Richter 1968, pp. 12-13. 6 Lauter 1976, pl. 11. 7 On Sicilian figurines carrying both a torch and a piglet, and found especially in sanctuaries of Demeter, see, e.g., Weg- ner 1982, pl. 58:3; the Sicilian types are quite different from the Corinthian. 8 Cf., e.g., the Parthenon frieze: Robertson and Frantz 1975, pl. 9, West XII:23, the folds on the tunic hem; photo of cast with better-preserved detail in Ridgway 198 la, fig. 43.</page><page sequence="275">DISCUSSION 251 the back, is known in earlier Corinthian figurines, for example, some of the Early Hellenistic votaries (e.g., H1), but the combination of this technique with the use of plaster molds is new. The best-preserved example of the second variant of the "priestess" type is H401; it is preserved only to the thighs, but MF-9251 from the Southeast Building (P1. 77, see catalogue) completes the type to the base. The lower part of the type, including leg positions, skirt arrangement, and base, seems to have been the same in both variants, although the proportions of the second variant are less slender, owing to the bulk of the extra drapery around the hips. In the second variant, a mantle was added to the peplos, covering the left shoulder, arm, and hand, and rolled around the waist to hang straight across the front like an apr on the anpeplos of this variant has a kolpos as well as an overfold, above which the edge of the mantle forms a second overfold. By the Middle Hellenistic period, the peplos arranged with a kolpos and overfold would have been extremely old-fashioned and must be accounted a Classicizing feature; the kolpos, however, is arranged straight across the top of the thighs, rather lower than the usual Classical arrangement, more like the Early Hellenistic votary H17 than the Classical C36, for example. The torch is longer and thinner than in the first variant, and the flame is so small and pointed that the object resembles a scepter more than a torch; on the analogy of the first variant, however, a torch is probably what is meant. Further, a fragment in lot 6641 shows diagonal incisions along the object, suggesting that it was made of some material tied or twisted together, as a torch would have been. There are several facial types, all rather similar to one another, associated with this variant. The face of H401 is rounder and fleshier than the face of H395, with a prominent chin. It has level, rather round eyes; a short, wide nose close to the small, smiling mouth; and a thin upper lip. This facial type is known in a beautifully crafted head of statuette scale from the sanctuary (H427) and in others of smaller scale in the Corinth collection, none of them wearing the polos (see p. 258). The facial features ofH402 are similar, but the face is wider, and the features are more clustered toward the center. Other heads wearing a polos (H403 and H404) show a generic similarity, but dull impressions or crude retouch conceal possible mechanical relationships. H404 shows the surface blisters of plaster molding. In fact, many of the surviving heads of this type in the lots are so dull, perhaps in part owing to the use of plaster molds, that they are recognizable only by their general outlines. It is likely that this facial type descends from the type preserved in statuette scale (H427). H405 is puzzling; it is larger than H401 and was made in a more traditional Corinthian technique in a terracotta mold, suggesting that it could be closer to the original design. There are a few possibly significant differences, however: the polos is narrower and fits differently, set straight across the head; a lock of hair on the right shoulder covers the spot where the round button should be; and the hair in back is gathered into a roll at the nape with long locks of hair falling from it, in a coiffure perhaps similar to that of the Classical C154, although in the complete figurine, the long locks of hair in back could have been gathered into the braid associated with the first "priestess" variant. H406 is another larger head that can be linked to this group, in this case by the preserved lower torus molding of what must be a polos. The facial type, however, is a departure from the norm, with fuller lips and narrowed, downturned eyes. The fabric of this head is also rather peculiar, more like that used for cooking pots than for figurines. Like these heads, five large-scale torso fragments probably of the "priestess" type are varied in detail and quality of workmanship, suggesting that there was a certain amount of experimentation with this type before it was frozen into the variants reproduced by plaster molds. H407 preserves only a fragment of the right side and a little of the front, showing an advanced right thigh with folds looped down to the side of the knee, but the characteristic kolpos with two hems above it is preserved. The fabric is excellent. The folds of the kolpos are carefully fashioned, in deep waves, not the random lumps ofH401; the overfold hem waves more shallowly above the kolpos,</page><page sequence="276">252 MIDDLE HELLENISTIC FIGURINES and on top of all, the edge of the mantle apron is stretched tautly. A fragment of smaller scale, perhaps mechanically related (see catalogue under H407), preserves more of the overfold and shows two widely spaced vertical folds down the right hip, as in H401. It is unfortunate that so much is lost, since this must have been a good rendering of the type. Even less is preserved of H408, which is only a fragment of the characteristic double hem and kolpos. This piece is either heavily retouched or handmade, and shows that less careful renderings, with the kolpos folds merely indicated by slashes, also existed at statuette scale. H409 preserves somewhat more of the overfold and skirt. Unfortunately, the surface is chipped, and so it is unclear whether the preserved bit of edge above the overfold hem is the edge of the mantle of a "priestess" type or just the end of an omega fold representing the pleat falling from the breast, as in C36. This figure is remarkable both for its size, which borders on sculptural scale, and for the remains of paint in four colors (yellow, bright blue, blue-green, and violet) on the skirt in no discernible pattern. H410, another statuette fragment, has the stance of the "priestess" type, a lumpy kolpos at thigh level comparable to that of H401, and a raised edge across the upper break that could belong to the right forearm bent to cradle the piglet, but the edge of the mantle is lacking. If the complete figure represented a "priestess," it would be a type combining aspects of H395, which lacks the mantle, and H401, which has a kolpos. Like H409, the skirt folds were deeply recut after modeling to emphasize light and shadow. In this respect, and also in the heavier breaking of the skirt hem over the insteps, H410 is unlike the plaster-modeled versions. H411 is a left-shoulder fragment of statuette scale with several elements of the "priestess" type: a long lock of hair framing the shoulder, a round button to fasten the peplos, and a chiton sleeve. This example, however, adds another lock of hair in front of the shoulder. The locks of hair and button were manual additions. It is apparent from the foregoing discussion that there was great interest in this type in Corinth, and coroplasts found different solutions to its rendering in different workshops. As in other instances among the Corinthian figurines, the larger pieces stand alone, sometimes show a good deal of retouch, and cannot be mechanically connected with the more numerous smaller examples. Mechanical relationships are discernible only for the two plaster-molded series, two generations of which could be traced. It seems likely that the type was first developed at statuette scale and was produced in more than one workshop. Since the plaster-molded variants are identical in technique and have the same conformation of the skirt and base, it is likely that they were made in the same workshop. It is also likely that the plaster-molded versions were developed using workshop materials related to a mold found in Corinth in the South Stoa, well IV (PI. 77).9 How this mold was related to the "priestess" figurines is a fascinating puzzle that shows how freely workshop materials could be reused and adapted to different types, and how difficult it is to reconstruct the workshop process when the evidence is incomplete. The mold, of statuette scale, represents a young woman in a pose and dress typical of votaries, standing quietly with both arms at her sides and wearing an ungirded peplos. Although no exact replica of this type was found at the Demeter sanctuary, its elements are recognizable in related types. The ungirded peplos with overfold to the top of the thighs, in a pyramidal outline and following the contours of the torso, can be found in the votary with piglet H1. The position of the arms is paralleled by H37. The closest parallel among the votaries is H16, which is similar in the wearing of a chiton beneath the peplos, in the fold pattern over the hips, and in the position of the right arm. The mold differs from t he votaries in the amplitude of the he body, with heavy arms and wide hips; the fastening of the peplos with round buttons; the facial type, which shows a narrow smiling mouth set into full 9 MF-8993: Broneer 1947, p. 242, pl. LXII:23; Coroplast's Art, p. 57, fig. 44 (there incorrectly assigned to the Southeast Building).</page><page sequence="277">DISCUSSION 253 cheeks and a prominent chin; and the long locks of hair outlining the shoulder. Although the mold must represent a votary, it is immediately apparent that there are elements in common with the "priestess" type: the characteristic shoulder-framing locks of hair, the peplos-over-chiton arrangement fastened with round buttons, the matronly proportions, and the facial type. Exactly what this means can only be surmised. Of the general run of "priestess" figurines, only H396 approaches the mold in scale, although it is still smaller. The other figurines are only somewhat more than half the size of the mold. Perhaps, once the "priestess" type was established at statuette scale using conventional techniques, one workshop made a cast from a later generation of a votary mold similar to the example from the South Stoa, remodeling the figure from the chest down and then taking plaster molds from this new archetype. Alternatively, we can assume that we do not have the earliest generations of the "priestess" type, or have them in too fragmentary a state to understand them, and that both the votary type known from the mold and the earliest "priestesses" were developed at the same time from the same archetype, as part of the same iconographic series. What this archetype could have been is another question. The material from which the design was derived is diverse. Although votaries carrying a piglet were already well known in Corinth in the Early Hellenistic period, the inspiration for a standing female figure cradling a piglet in one arm and also holding a torch in the other is most likely to have come from the long series of Sicilian figurines of this type representing Persephone, which were still being produced in a conservative style through the 3rd century B.c.l? In this source, the arm positions were reversed, with the piglet carried in the left arm. Apart from the subject, however, the more advanced, purely Hellenistic style of the South Stoa mold and the "priestess" figurines must come from a completely different source. The source for H401, with its full-cheeked facial type with a small mouth and prominent chin, coupled with a polos, can perhaps be found in northern Asia Minor and Dacia, where similar heads of figurines are more common; examples from Troy, Callatis, Pergamon, and Gordion can be cited, particularly for figurines of the enthroned Cybele.ll A similar sculptural iconography for Cybele was brought to Greece, as in double naiskoi of the Mother of the Gods from Delphi, Corinth, and Athens, which show a comparable facial type, round in shape, with a wide, flat nose and thin lips.12 Pausanias (2.4.7) records a temple and statue of the Mother of the Gods on Acrocorinth, apparently not far from the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore. While some of the evidence for the worship of the Mother in Corinth must be of Roman or uncertain date, two figurine fragments point to local interest in her iconography during the Hellenistic period13 and suggest that a representation of her could have been the source for the head of the "priestess" type. Types other than Cybele, however, also reflect a similar facial type. The head of Nyx (or Persephone) from the Great Altar of Pergamon14 can be cited as another parallel for the facial type and shows matronly proportions as well, although there are no signs in the "priestess" group of the Pergamene baroque drapery style. The inclusion of Classical, even specifically Atticizing elements, as mentioned above (a coiffure like that of the Erechtheion caryatids, a 5th-century B.C. Attic drapery pattern, the peplos with a kolpos), recall this trend in Pergamene art in the later 10 Morgantina, p. 48. 1t Troy, e.g., p. 82, no. 28, pl.

If her pose and the attributes of piglet and torch are derived from Sicilian figurines, her facial type is of eastern origin, and her Classicizing elements are Pergamene in flavor, the mantle arrangement of the second variant (H401) may be a relatively local affair. Two headless Hellenistic statues from Megara show the mantle draped apron-style around the torso.17 One statue has the mantle rolled around the waist and over the left shoulder and arm; there are catenaries over the abdomen, as in H401, but only the mantle hem shows above the kolpos, the hem of the peplos overfold being hidden. The second statue, a more heavy-set figure, shows both hems, as in H401; the mantle is draped over both shoulders and the chest and forms an additional, trianufronal, triangular apron in front. Perhaps the closest in drapery arrangement to H401, although the head is unrelated, is a statue from "near Athens" in New York.18 This figure shows both hems above the kolpos, and the upper torso is similarly draped as well. The subjects of these statues are uncertain. The forearms of all were extended, suggesting an orans pose; the examples from Megara could have been portrait statues of priestesses, given the apron motif in one of them.19 The statue in New York, however, has an idealized rather than a portrait head; she does not wear a polos. Whatever technique was entailed in the actual creation of the "priestess" type from these disparate elements, it is unlikely to have happened before the later 3rd century B.C. Lot 3217 (Pit 1965-1), which contains pottery dating through the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. and more than two hundred figurines, has no recognizable fragments of any version of the "priestess" type.20 While such an argumentum ex silentio is certainly not conclusive, the evidence of style in this case also points toward the later 3rd to early 2nd centuries B.C. for the creation of the type.21 The final matter to be discussed is the actual identity of the "priestess" type. The polos immediately suggests that we are dealing with a goddess.22 The closest iconographic parallels for female figurines holding the piglet and torch are from Sicily;23 they have been convincingly shown to represent Persephone, although the pig and torch are associated with Demeter as well. The Corinthian type already has been published as a representation of Demeter.24 There is, moreover, a known syncretism between Demeter and Cybele,25 whose iconography apparently was a factor in the development of this type. The matronly appearance of figure and face might support the identification as Demeter, but the mold from the South Stoa (MF-8993, P1. 77), which must portray a young votary on the basis of dress, pose, and coiffure, nevertheless has a generously proportioned figure and a not particularly youthful facial type.26 Although Corinthian coroplasts of the Early Hellenistic period seem to have been adept at rendering persons of differing ages in a 15 Summarized by Pollitt 1986, pp. 83-84. 16 Besques 1981, pp. 236-239, esp. fig. 20, in Cairo. 17 Horn 1931, p. 93, pl. 42. 18 Richter 1954, p. 200, no. 201, pl. CXLII. 19 On the apron as a priestly attribute, see the discussion of H85, p. 140. On the orans pose, see Thasos XVII, pp. 476-478; a few of the Corinthian peplos-figurines (e.g., C17) may have taken this pose, but the forearms are not preserved. 20 There is one "priestess" head among the more than 1,200 figurines from lot 2249, part of the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the pottery of which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. While the material from this lot is almost entirely consistent for the 4th century B.C. and earlier, the fill is not a sealed deposit and contains an occasional stray sherd or figurine fragment. The head must be intrusive in this lot. Similarly, one head in lot 2063 (MF-11781) must be later than the 4th-century B.C. to Early Hellenistic pottery in the lot. H401 is from a pottery lot (6502) terminating in the first half of the 3rd century B.C., but the architectural context of the lot is later. On the use of pottery contexts for dating the figurines, see pp. 5-6. 21 Romano (1994, p. 90, no. 76) has conflated the "priestess" type with the earlier votary with piglet ("pig girl") type and has published a too-long date range that should be disregarded. 22 On the polos as a sign of godhead, see Morgantina, pp. 81- 82; Zuntz 1971, p. 92 (not necessarily a sign of a deity); on the polos worn by Cybele: D.

For one thing, the earlier tradition of votive types appears to have ceased by this time. For another, the coroplast could, consciously or not, have embodied the aspects of both goddesses in one type.27 An element that complicates the matter further is the mantle of the second variant, which is wrapped like an apron around the torso in the manner of participants in sacrifices (see p. 140, note 150). There is written evidence for priestesses of Demeter and Persephone in Corinth (Diodoros 16.66.3-4; Plutarch, Timoleon 8.1), reporting their dream before Timoleon's expedition to Sicily. On the other hand, deities also are shown in Greek art participating in sacrifice, sometimes wearing a mantle folded into an apron.28 Certainly the distinction between mortal and deity can be blurred in ritual. At Eleusis, the priestess of Demeter and Kore is thought to have impersonated both goddesses during the celebration of the Mysteries.29 Whether goddess or mortal is sacrificing in the figurine type, the ritual context would turn the "attributes" of piglet and torch into, respectively, the sacrificial animal and the means of lighting the altar.30 A further connection of the torch with this sanctuary is Plutarch's (Timoleon 8.3) comparison of the torch that guided Timoleon to Sicily with the torch used in the Mysteries. Perhaps we are dealing here with a type filled with meaning, embodying simultaneously the goddesses themselves, the mortal priestess in the guise of the goddesses, the act of sacrifice, and the sacred symbols of the cult. It is perhaps not insignificant that the "priestess" type was developed at a time when the long series of votaries carrying a piglet appear to have come to an end. If these figurines were dedicated in place of the votary types, does it mean that they, too, represent mortals, or does it show a greater emphasis on the goddesses and their servants, implying some movement in the cult toward greater institutionalization and less personal involvement?31 Further, if the iconography of Cybele contributed to the creation of a popular votive type, can we assume that worshipers recognized Cybele in the type, and are we to see an expansion in the focus of the cult, at least in the syncretism of Cybele with Demeter, or perhaps with Aphrodite Ourania, with whom Cybele was associated at Isthmia?32 If the nearby shrine of the Mother of the Gods mentioned by Pausanias (2.4.7) was active in the Hellenistic period, could there have been influence from that source? OTHER STANDING DRAPED FEMALE TYPES (H412-H424) The possible convergence of priestess and goddess images in the figurine group just discussed has some relevance to H412, which also may show some overlap of types. Most of the head of this statuette is missing, but there is enough to show long, thick locks of hair flowing freely over the shoulders. The peplos, more of which is preserved in a later generation (see catalogue), is ungirded and has the pyramidal outline typical of votary figurines (see p. 118); a chiton sleeve is marked on one arm. The later generation has both arms at the sides. Since the unbound coiffure of H412 is also typical of votaries, it would seem that we have here such a type. The type would be a rougher, less detailed version of a votary resembling the mold from the South Stoa (MF-8993, PI. 77). In H412, however, the right upper arm is extended to the side, in a pose 27 This may have happened in the case of the seated goddess on the painted Corinthian plate of the Sam Wide Group in Athens (see p. 43). 28 Morgantina, pp. 45-48, with bibliography; for a sacrific- ing god wearing a triangular apron, see p. 167, no. 295a, pl. 66. See Simon 1953, pp. 67-78, on the Eleusinian deities sacrificing. 29 Mylonas 1961, pp. 310-311; R. S. J. Garland 1984, p. 100. There is no mention of this aspect of the priestess' function in the material collected by Clinton 1974, pp. 68-76. 30 Artemis lights the altar with torches in a bronze relief from Delos: LIMC II, 1984, pp. 699-700, no. 1027, pl. 525, s.v. Artemis (L. Kahil and N. Icard). 31 Van Straten's study (1993) of the composition of Classical and Hellenistic votive reliefs suggests that the gods seem more distant from humans in the latter period, when they are placed above humans in vertical compositions, implying a relationship of ruler to subject (pp. 263-264). 32 Isthmia VI, pp. 39-43, no. 89, pl. 31:b; Harrison 1982a, pp. 50-51.</page><page sequence="280">256 MIDDLE HELLENISTIC FIGURINES expected not of a votary but of a goddess, who might lean on a scepter or long torch. If indeed a votary figure has been so altered, a convergence of mortal and divine types could then be seen in this image. H414 is similar in scale and technique and could be of the same type; if so, it would show more of the head, but the poor state of preservation reveals only full, parted lips and perhaps a short nose in an oval face. H415 could belong to this group, although the pose of the head is more rigidly frontal. The broad-cheeked, girlish face, short nose, and long hair call to mind the head wearing a stephane (H178), which was found in a pottery context of the late 4th century B.C. The face of H415 is essentially Classical, but the combination of such a face with deeply shadowed, snaky locks of hair, which are more consonant with a Middle Hellenistic date, suggests that the head was made not earlier than the late 3rd or early 2nd century B.C. The fragmentary H413 is of similar type, as far as it is preserved, and of still larger scale. All the pieces in this group are of coarse workmanship; in H413, the hair in back is merely an added thick, undetailed sheet of clay. The group that follows is of vastly superior workmanship, but it may be related in type to the preceding group. H416 is the raised right arm of a statuette with long locks of hair and wearing a sleeved chiton. As such, it calls to mind the type better preserved compositionally in the poorly crafted H412; its very large scale and good workmanship, with well-modeled, gilded hair and a violet-painted garment, suggest that it could belong to the type of which H412 was a poor relation. The piece is not unique, since there are similar statuette fragments in the lots (see catalogue). It is similar in fabric and scale to the possible "priestess" fragment H411. There are also a few pieces of related type in statuette scale made in a pale, thinner-walled and harder-fired fabric, somewhat like one of the better Roman fabrics, as in the Aphrodite figurines R13 and R14. The raised right arm, long locks of hair, and chiton sleeve of H417 should link it typologically with the group under discussion, particularly since both the sleeve and the hair were manual additions, suggesting that the coroplast was aiming to reproduce a particular type. There are no clear signs of a peplos over the chiton, however. H418, which probably belongs to the same statuette on the basis of scale, fabric, and technique, shows a mantle rolled around the hips and a distinctive pattern of arrowhead folds. The only other instance of such folds among the figurines from the Demeter sanctuary are across the mantle overfold of H85, where they are more organically coherent. Perhaps the folds of H418 were pulled into points by the forward movement of the right thigh in the complete figure. The mantle is rolled neither snuggly around the waist, as in H85, nor below the navel, framing the abdomen, as in H128, but somewhere modestly in between. The outstretched arm certainly suggests that this statuette represents one of the goddesses holding a scepter or perhaps a torch, but there are no clues to her identity. H419 is another statuette of similar fabric, preserved sufficiently to show the girding of the chiton at the natural waistline. In this case, the rolled mantle falls to just below the knees and is transparent, with very lightly modeled folds, and faint vertical folds of the chiton are visible beneath. The use of gilding and violet paint link it technically with H416. Exactly when the rendering of drapery seen through a layer of transparent cloth began is unclear, but it surely was in use by the later 3rd century B.C.33 A group of large (size range 3 to 4-5), thin-walled, draped female figurines (H130, H138, H140, H144, and H145) has been discussed in the Early Hellenistic chapter (pp. 149-150) because the drapery arrangements, as far as preserved, could be read as Early Hellenistic. Their fabric and scale, however, which are reminiscent of the group now under discussion, might bring their date of manufacture down into the Middle Hellenistic period. H420 is a statuette fragment that that must represent one of the goddesses, could be a variant of the long-haired type with a raised right arm (e.g., H417), and probably should be dated to this 33 The arguments are summarized by Ridgway 1990, pp. 219-220, with reference to the Baker Dancer.</page><page sequence="281">DISCUSSION 257 period by virtue of its combination of large scale and coarse rendering. In this case, a mantle originally seems to have been draped behind the figure and over the raised arm from front to back, with the edge folds showing at the extreme right. The hand that emerged from the mantle folds and is now missing grasped a thick, cylindrical object that tapers slightly toward the bottom and is probably a torch. This statuette could represent Kore, although long locks of hair and a torch are attributes of Demeter as well. Another fragment of statuette scale with rough retouch is H421, which preserves part of a female type with an advanced left thigh, covered with curving mantle folds, and the mantle end, which must have dropped from the arm, beside it. Further indications of dramatically draped female types of statuette scale are a number of foot fragments wearing sandals with very high, indented soles and usually showing long toes and heav- ily collapsing hems over the insteps. Three examples have been catalogued (H422-H424), the last of which may have belonged to a seated type. The high soles, deeply indented around the toes, suggest a 2nd-century B.C. date, particularly for H424 in which the toes slightly overhang the edge of the sole.34 The thongs or straps are not represented in relief, even at this large scale, and must have been painted.35 Such high-soled sandals were rendered by coroplasts in Pergamon36 and Priene37 during the 2nd century B.C. and are well known in Hellenistic sculptured female figures as well.38 Among the Corinthian figurines, the only identifiable type from the Demeter sanctuary to wear fairly high-soled sandals is the semidraped standing Aphrodite H249.39 A standing draped female figurine in Munich, which is probably Corinthian, wears very high-soled sandals.40 The type is otherwise unremarkable, however, wearing a chiton and mantle draped loosely around the hips; the head is similar to H227, with a melon coiffure. If the figurine represents a mortal woman, as it seems, the high-soled sandals would simply be a matter of fashion. The most striking aspect of these Middle Hellenistic figurines is the preponderance of large scale. Doubtless, smaller figurines in the Early Hellenistic tradition were still being made, but there is a noticeable shift away from types that are either also known in bronze or look as if they could have been designed in conjunction with small bronzes, toward types that often call to mind stone sculpture. Perhaps it is not too farfetched to suggest that by the middle or third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. the Corinthian industry that had encouraged the production of terracotta figurines in conjunction with small bronzes was no longer active and that coroplasts had to look elsewhere for models. It is perhaps significant that the influence of stone sculpture on terracotta figurines during the Middle Hellenistic period was felt in other centers as well, such as Priene, where the rich Hellenistic sculptural tradition of Asia Minor was an important factor.41 ISOLATED FEMALE HEADS (H425-H430) A relatively small number of heads, including some of statuette scale, show facial types and coiffures that were not part of the Early Hellenistic repertoire. H425 and H426 have faces that are comparable to the "priestess" H401, although they are so degenerate that mechanical relationships are not clear. Both have long, flowing hair and tubular fillets, which are also found in Early Hellenistic votaries such as H20. The added veil of H425 is not paralleled among the earlier figurines, except that their smooth, long locks of hair are sometimes veil-like, as in the torch carrier H23. 34 Morrow 1985, pp. 90-97, 162-163, figs. 8, 9. 35 For sandal details represented in relief on figurines, see, e.g., Troy, p. 126, no. 168, pi.

The heads are not identical-H427 has a proportionately larger nose and a thinner upper lip, a feature that is found in other Middle Hellenistic Corinthian heads as well (e.g., H401 and H428)-but the similarity is striking enough to suggest a date for H427 in the second quarter of the 2nd century B.C. The relationship is strengthened by the addition of locks of hair to H427 to render a coiffure that is found in the Altar in other heads as well, for example, the so-called beautiful head.43 Like Athens in the second half of the 5th century B.C., Pergamon in the first half of the 2nd century B.C. was the source of a widely disseminated style. Knowledge of that style could have reached Corinth either through craftsmen familiar with it or through imported workshop materials, although not, apparently, through imported figurines. The same deliberately added coiffure is found on H428, another well-made head of statuette scale. It has a longer and more straight-sided face and is in the tradition of such Early Hellenistic heads as H180, but the large scale, coiffure, and thin upper lip should make it contemporary with H427. This head seems to be a reworking of a local type rather than a new creation based on foreign material. Both these heads show that workshops employing highly skilled craftsmen and interested in the most recent artistic developments were still active in Corinth shortly before the destruction of the city in 146 B.C. H427 originally wore a stephane, but the subject of the head is unknown, since the stephane could be worn by either goddesses or mortals. The facial type became very popular, reappearing at smaller scale repeatedly, although not clearly in mechanical relationship (see catalogue), in heads wearing different headdresses. For example, H429, in which the face has become nearly round, has a coiffure with a bow-knot, which has been nearly concealed by a thick, added wreath wrapped in a fillet. Such wreaths have been dated to the 2nd century B.C.; the wearing of wreaths is associ- ated with festivals, which suggests that H429 represents a mortal woman.44 H430 may be a degen- erate version of this facial type, with a veil added; it is the only head from the sanctuary so veiled. Perhaps the head H191 should be mentioned here once again. It was discussed with Early Hellenistic heads (p. 160) because of its 4th-century B.C. facial type, but its large scale and classicizing coiffure could point to a 2nd-century B.C. date of manufacture. ISOLATED MALE HEAD (H431) The remaining head (H431), of statuette scale, probably represents a male, since the flesh is painted red. The long, centrally parted hair is known for males in the Early Hellenistic standing nude youth H299. It is possible, however, that the red paint, which was applied directly to the clay, without the customary underlying white slip, and which covers the eyeballs, was itself an underpainting for the pink paint of female flesh. The head is likely to be entirely handmade and not merely heavily reworked, not only because it has an uneven surface but also because it is solid, and a head of this scale would normally be hollow if it were moldmade. The rendering of the hair suggests that this head must be among the latest Corinthian coroplastic work before 146 B.C., since the snaky, separately modeled, almost Pergamene locks of hair point to the second 42 See p. 253, note 14. 43 Luschey 1962, pp. 12-19 on the "beautiful head"; for the coiffure, see also p. 4, fig. 3. 44 On wreaths, see Troy, pp. 45-47; Blech 1982.</page><page sequence="283">CATALOGUE 259 quarter of the 2nd century B.C. That H431 is probably handmade is in itself of interest, even though the craftsman was not highly skilled, cutting the nose and mouth crudely and shaping the eyes differently from one another. There is as yet only a little evidence for terracotta sculpture in Corinth in the Hellenistic period,45 but the existence of a handmade head in size range 5 points to a workshop making what are essentially small sculptures as late as the second quarter of the 2nd century B.C. Another intriguing aspect of this head is that the workshop may have been trying to render a head of the Eubouleus type, a much-copied marble youth based on a 4th-century B.C. work and possibly representing Triptolemos.46 Taking into account the different material and the rough technique, the sculptor's intention was to create a head of a youth with uncut hair waving in thick locks, with an open pincer of two curved locks of hair on the forehead, and a full-featured face with fleshy lips. This description generally fits the Eubouleus type and points to the possibility that, if this head represents a male, Triptolemos was represented at the sanctuary.

These categories are (1) figurines of animals; (2) reliefs: headdresses, a votive shield, and a rider plaque; (3) votive offerings in isolated hands, separated from figurines of unknown type; (4) miscellaneous figurine fragments of uncertain date and unknown original type, of interest technically or iconographically; (5) bases and supports; and (6) molds. ANIMALS (V1-V13) In this section are discussed the Classical and Hellenistic animals, which, with one exception, are moldmade. The finds of Archaic animal figurines in the Demeter sanctuary are more numerous and are more varied in the kinds of animals represented. 1 It is likely that some of these handmade types continued to be produced into the Classical and perhaps even the Hellenistic period. New creations after the Archaic period include moldmade pigs, a bull, a ram, a sheep or goat, a monkey, birds, roosters, and a tortoise. Presumably, those of the animal figurines that are appropriate refer to the practice of animal sacrifice, perhaps providing a substitute when the dedicator could not afford to provide the real thing (see p. 322). At another level, the animal figurines could have been symbolic, referring to specific deities or to the concerns of the dedicators. PIGS The symbolic connection of pigs and their young to fertility cults is too well known to need more than a brief explication here.2 The very nature of the pig, its large litters and its highly efficient conversion of almost any food into an edible product for humans, must be at the basis of its ancient link to abundance. In addition, the ability of the pig to dispose of a large variety of wastes contributed to the hygiene of the community.3 If Demeter at this sanctuary was considered a guardian of the health of children, as has been suggested above (p. 70), then the connotation of the pig here perhaps could be extended from fertility to health. Another extension of the symbolic link between the pig and fertility is found in the colloquial use of the word "piglet" to refer to the genitals of maidens (see p. 118). Ritually, this usage is significant, because the piglet has been taken as a symbol for Kore herself descending into the Underworld, particularly when the animals were cast into pits, as in the preliminary rituals of the Eleusinian Mysteries and at the Athenian Thesmophoria.4 The late aition for this practice is the swallowing up of the swineherd Eubouleus and his animals together with Kore.5 While it is unclear whether or not piglets were cast into pits in the Demeter sanctuary (see p. 119), bones of Publication forthcoming. 2 Bevan 1986, I, pp. 67-73. 3 R.

All are thin-walled and made in two symmetrical molds, one for each side of the animal; all parts, including the base, were included in the molds, and only V3 and V4 show any retouch, in spite of the generally dull impressions. Other fragments in the lots (see catalogue under VI) are generally similar in technique. This straightforward approach to figurine making is typical of some of the workshops of the Potters' Quarter; although no pig figurines were found in the Potters' Quarter, it is likely to have been the source of these pieces. V3 is the largest of the three but seems to be of a different mold series. Instead of the typically flattened, upturned pig's snout, it has a pointed, almost canine face. In this respect it resembles a fully preserved figurine in the Corinth collection (MF- 10293), which is a nicely observed depiction of a nervous or playful, almost crouching young animal.9 V4 is of a coarser fabric but is probably also Corinthian. There is also a fragmentary imported pig (190) of uncertain provenience. None of the pigs was found in a datable context, but the high, splaying, rectangular base of V2 is of a Classical type (see p. 275), and the probable connection with the Potters' Quarter provides a terminus ante quem of the 320s B.C. The two pigs with preserved bodies (VI and V2) have the short legs and fat bodies of sty pigs rather than herded animals, which are leaner and longer-legged.10 Their bellies touch the base, apparently either to show animals fattened and ready for slaughter or to suggest that they are pregnant.11 The type of pig domesticated in ancient Corinth appears to have had a pronounced dorsal ridge of bristles, marked with light strokes in the figurines. In spite of signs that the Corinthian moldmade pigs were produced in some quantity without much regard for the rendering of detail, they are more naturalistically designed and better made than pig figurines from other places. These are sometimes misshapen and usually rest on pointed stumps for feet, without bases.12 Only one of the pigs from the Demeter sanctuary (MF-13739)13 can be dated to the Archaic period by its technique (it is handmade and solid, with a pinhole vent). In the Classical period, at least two new, moldmade versions of the subject were created, represented by V and MF- 10293; V3 and V4 are too fragmentary to determine whether they represent different creations or are merely variants. VI shows delicate parallel incisions to represent the bristles; since the incisions were in the mold, the mold could have been taken from a bronze (see p. 81). The increased interest in pig votives after the Archaic period could perhaps be explained by the creation of new types in bronze that stimulated coroplasts. There may also be some connection with the absence of figurines representing votaries carrying piglets at the Demeter sanctuary before the Early Classical period; C1 is the earliest, although they were already popular in Sicily in the 6th century B.C. (see p. 26). It is surprising, however, that the total number of pig figurines actually preserved at the sanctuary for all periods, including fragments counted and left in the lots, is only about twelve. Among the terracotta sculptures, there is a fragment showing a hand holding the rear leg of a piglet down at the side.14 6 Corinth XVIII, ii, e.g., p. 153. 7 On the economics of pig sacrifice, see Jameson 1988, pp. 98-99.

At Eleusis, a bull was sacrificed by the ephebes at the conclusion of the Mysteries.15 The figurine also could have been offered as a request for success in animal husbandry. The bull was closely associated with Dionysos, who appears to have been worshiped at this sanctuary as well, because it was known for both generative power and potential destructiveness, symbolizing the dual nature of the god.l6 While there is only a single post-Archaic, locally made bull figurine from the sanctuary (V5), there are several earlier, handmade renderings (MF-10392, MF-11906, MF-71-27017), two imported pieces (one a bucranium [191] and one a cow or bull [192]), and three small bronze bulls.18 Although V5 is only a fragment and is a rather dull impression, roughly tooled, the nicely detailed original design survives in the folds of skin on the forehead and the tongue in the open, bellowing mouth. The source of this figurine probably was a bronze, since in addition to the bronzes found in the sanctuary, others, dated to the 5th century B.C., have been found in Corinth,19 and it is not difficult to find good examples from nearby centers, for example, in the Argolid20 and Isthmia.21 Some of these bronze bulls are shown with their heads down, and it is possible that V5 should be reconstructed similarly. RAM V6 is a head fragment of a curly-horned, moldmade ram. Although its fabric is a little coarser than usual, it does seem to be Corinthian. All the ram figurines from the sanctuary are curly horned, but most are smaller, handmade, and probably earlier (e.g., MF-1175322). As in the case of other domesticated animals, the presence of such figurines at the sanctuary could be interpreted either as a request for the success of flocks or as a substitute for an actual animal sacrifice. The sacrificial ram could have had a specific meaning at this sanctuary, since rams are known to have been sacrificed to Kore at Eleusis and elsewhere.23 Although the complete design ofV6 may have been quite good, little detail remains in this dull mold impression, and nothing can be determined about the origin of the type. A small bronze ram dated to the 5th century B.C. has been found in Corinth,24 but it cannot be connected to representations in terracotta. A fine, naturalistically detailed, moldmade terracotta figurine of a curly-horned ram in London is of Boeotian manufacture.25 It is slightly smaller than V6, but the dull impression of the Corinthian figurine could indicate that its mold was taken directly from a good imported piece similar to the Boeotian version. SHEEP OR GOAT The fragmentary V7 represents a caprine with straight, shaggy fleece; there is no indication of its sex. This figure is technically much different from the animals discussed above, since it is thick-walled and fired very hard, is of statuette scale, and was probably handmade, with the fleece rendered by means of slashes. It shows a contradiction in the quality of its workmanship that is seen elsewhere in Corinthian coroplastic work (see p. 19), when rough tooling is combined with well-prepared and well-fired fabric. The right rear leg is bent backward, showing that the 15 Burkert 1983, pp. 292-293; Clinton 1988, p. 71; Cor- inth XVIII, iii, p. 233, note 1. 16 Otto 1965, pp. 165-167; Goodenough 1958, VII, pp. 14- 20. 17 Publication forthcoming. 18 Stroud 1965, pp. 18-19, pl. 9:b (MF-10785); Bookidis and Stroud 1987, p. 17, fig. 15 (MF-12170); MF-10653. 19 MF-3429, MF-523, Corinth XII, pp. 65-66, nos. 497, 498, pl. 47. 20 Protonotariou-Deilaki 1971, p. 84, pl. 70:3. 21 Isthmia VII, pp. 1, 4-5, nos. 1-7, pls. 1, 2. 22 Publication forthcoming. 23 Burkert 1983, pp. 145, 282-283; on the symbolism of sheep, including the association of the ram with generative power, see Goodenough 1958, VIII, pp. 71-85. 24 MF-115, Corinth XII, p. 65, no. 496, pl. 47. 25 British Museum I, p. 233, no. 872, pl. 125.</page><page sequence="291">268 CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC VARIA animal was in movement. The direction of the locks of the fleece on the remaining stump of the right front leg suggests that the leg originally was advancing, and the animal would in this case be leaping rather than walking. If this statuette represented a sheep, it presumably would have been offered in lieu of a sacrificial animal; if a goat, its tie to this sanctuary also might have been the goat's symbolic connection with sexuality and with the god Dionysos.26 This piece belongs to a context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C., but similar large terracotta animal figures were made elsewhere into Roman times.27 MONKEY The head of a monkey V8 belongs to a well-known class of Corinthian comic types, consisting of monkeys in a variety of human activities (see p. 194). Such monkeys were made in Rhodes as well,28 but it was the Corinthian coroplasts who fully realized the comic potential of this subject. In some of these types, the monkeys are pictured with mortars and pestles, either turning a somersault in the mortar29 or grinding grain while wearing a veil or a crown of pointed leaves and eating a cake.30 The veil and crown probably are a reference to bridal headdresses. Monkeys are thought to have been fertility symbols and apotropaic devices,31 and in these figurines the impish monkeys both help in women's work and spoil it by rolling in the grain or consuming the prepared cake. The mouth of V8 is opened wide and twisted to the right side; something has been broken away from it, suggesting that it originally belonged to a type similar to one in London, mentioned above, in which the monkey stands before a mortar, grinding with a pestle while eating a round, flat cake.32 V8 was probably made in the Potters' Quarter, where molds for monkey figurines were found.33 If this is correct, its terminus ante quem would be the 320s B.C., the date of the demise of the Potters' Quarter workshops. BIRDS Terracotta figurines of birds, both flying and at rest, were an important votive type in Corinth. Most of those found in the Demeter sanctuary are handmade and are either Archaic in date or Archaic survivals.34 V9 is a moldmade type with a delicate feather pattern along the top of the tail, rendered in the mold. Since it is both moldmade and concave underneath, it falls between two classes of birds recognized by Stillwell among the Potters' Quarter finds, class XXVII, which is concave underneath but handmade, and XXVIII, which is moldmade but solid.35 The schematic feather pattern, similar on all the moldmade examples, shows a plain panel down the center flanked by curved feathers. A source in bronze is likely, not only because the engraving is so delicate but also because an Archaic example in bronze was found in Perachora.36 Since V9 is not fully rounded underneath, the pattern was necessarily flattened and part of the effect lost, but the intention is clear nevertheless. V9, which must have been made in the Potters' Quarter, was found in Pit A, the terminal date of which is the last quarter of the 5th century B.C. The bird represented is probably a dove, which could suggest some connection with Aphrodite,37 but birds were commonly offered in Corinth at hero shrines.38 There are doves among the terracotta sculpture from the sanctuary as well.39 26 Otto 1965, pp. 167-169.

Since neither the pose nor the incised pattern of overlapping feathers matches any of the common Corinthian votive bird types, the figurine could have represented a birdlike creature usually shown in an upright pose. A siren comes to mind for its chthonic associations. A stone siren with a somewhat similar feather pattern was found at the Potters' Quarter.40 ROOSTERS The best-known Corinthian terracotta roosters are the lingering Archaic plaques made at the Potters' Quarter,41 a few of which were found at the Acrocorinth sanctuary.42 Figurines of a youth and a boy carrying roosters were found, however (C191 and H322), as well as an Archaic handmade rooster (MF-71-27643) and later handmade (VI1) and moldmade (V12) examples. Both of the later figurines are fairly dismal creations of uncertain date, following neither the Corinthian plaques in type nor three-dimensional rooster figurines from elsewhere, such as those found in Rhodes.44 V12 could be of Roman date because of its very large eye, which is often found in Roman rooster figurines.45 The rooster is an attribute of Persephone on the Lokroi plaques46 and is an appropriate dedication to the chthonic deities. TORTOISE The fragment of a tortoise shell V13 is unlike figurines of tortoises, which usually represent the entire body. This fragment seems not to represent the living animal but to be part of a model chelys-lyre.47 In the construction of this instrument, the patterned side of the shell of testudo marginata, which is native to Greece, was utilized for the back; a piece of hide was drawn tightly across the front to form the sound box and was wrapped to the back over the edge, forming a border, as seen in V13. In the Archaic period, the sound box took the natural oval or round shape of the animal's carapace, but the more sophisticated construction technique of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. altered the shape to that seen in V13. This is the only piece of its kind yet found in Corinth, although there is a figurine of a youth carrying a lyre from the sanctuary (C190), a type also known in the Asklepieion (see catalogue). Actual lyres or model lyres made from small tortoise shells have been found at Argos and elsewhere,48 dedicated to Apollo or placed in graves. Either the dedication of a model lyre at the Demeter sanctuary makes a connection with Asklepios and Apollo, through the interest of the cult in the health of children and the coming-of-age of youths, or the use of model lyres as grave gifts suggests that they are appropriate dedications to chthonic deities. V13 belongs to a pottery context terminating in the later 3rd century B.C. There is also a tortoise among the terracotta sculptures.49 RELIEFS (V14-V19) In this section are discussed types characterized by figures in relief, either made separately and added to the surface, as in the headdresses V14-V17, or formed in the mold together with the background, as in the votive shield V18 and the rider plaque V19. 40 S-1473, Corinth XV, i, pp. 70-71, 80-81, no.

While model poloi are known to have been dedicated as votives in themselves,50 the surface of this polos is pinched up at the back of both fragments, suggesting that originally it was joined to something, presumably a head. The female head C100 wears a polos of similar type, although being a good deal smaller, the polos is plain, without added figures in relief. In addition, the headdress V17 is contoured at the bottom as if to accommodate the curves of a coiffure, and there are remains of what is probably the top of the head at both the front and back of V16. It is tempting to try to extract from the relief figures on the surface of the polos V14 references to the cult followed at this sanctuary, but this would be a mistake, since the figures are known to be stock types also used to decorate miniature altars and relief pottery. The most fully preserved groupings are found on "Tarentine" arulae and consist of Apollo and Leto, Dionysos with a satyr and maenad, Poseidon and Amymone (identified by the hydria she carries), and a female figure (Nike?) decking a trophy.51 The arulae are thought to be of Athenian origin and are dated before the middle of the 3rd century B.C.52 There are examples of these relief figures on Corinthian pottery and workshop material as well as arulae.53 The scene on the polos, which does not have narrative continuity, has been described in detail in the catalogue. Beginning at the viewer's left of fragment A (P1. 62), a female figure is shown carrying a vessel in the lowered right hand. The chiton or peplos is girded high, and the left hand is raised to the chest. This figure is identified as Amymone on the arulae. The two remaining figures on fragment A are physically connected, a female figure nearly in profile, possibly veiled, with a scepter, followed by a semidraped, frontal male figure who reaches out toward her shoulder; both wear mantles with a triangular overfold. The male figure would be Poseidon, who normally is shown next to Amymone; the female figure usually appears with a seated Apollo (as on fragment B) and should be Leto. Of the three figures on fragment B, the central one clearly represents the seated, nude Apollo holding a kithara or lyre on his lap. At the viewer's left of Apollo is a draped female figure reaching out to deck a trophy; at his right is a poorly preserved enthroned female figure, presumably a goddess. This array of figures seems to be a pastiche of what was available to the coroplast. V15 is another, cruder polos fragment, showing the female figure decking a trophy. V16 could belong to a headdress more like a tiara than a polos, since its finished edge at the viewer's right indicates that it was open at the back. The fragment must belong to the left side of the head, showing three figures. The two figures at the viewer's left are a maenad and Dionysos, recognizable from better impressions,54 but instead of the expected accompanying satyr, Leto appears at the other side of Dionysos. The crenellations of this poor piece have degenerated into scallops. The last of the headdresses (V17) also has a finished edge and apparently an open back, like V16, but would belong to the right side of the head. Although the quality is poor, the figures of gods in relief are easily recognizable, in a different array than before. From the viewer's left are Apollo with a kithara, this time standing, draped, and looking over his shoulder; Artemis in a short chiton; and Poseidon holding a trident, with his right foot on a rock.

Gasparri).</page><page sequence="294">DISCUSSION 271 this headdress is different, with the figures molded together in a strip in a plaster mold (the surface of V17 is blistered) and then attached all together to the surface of the headdress. The Greek crenellated polos is thought to be based upon the mural headdress of Hittite city goddesses; it is worn by various goddesses, particularly Cybele, and sometimes also by brides.55 In V15, the surfaces of the wall are plain, the crenellations marked with simple knife cuts. In the better-made V14, vertical slashes were added, perhaps to represent narrow windows for archers.56 The form of this crown is different from the more elaborate mural crowns that try to render a wall fully, sometimes with towers, as in sculptural representations of Tyche,57 but there are variants in this type of headdress, and the intention to represent a kind of mural crown seems clear enough. At Corinth, the deity wearing such a crown must have been strongly identified with the fortifications of Acrocorinth and the safety of the city. The most likely candidate among the deities associated with this sanctuary would be Aphrodite (see p. 170). Although the relief figures of deities surrounding the headdresses do not make obvious reference either to Aphrodite or to Demeter and Kore, they could have had a general apotropaic purpose. The selection of Apollo and Poseidon in particular is appropriate to Corinth. This high, crenellated crown should not be confused with the low crown worn by the seated goddess type (C95-C97), who could be either Kore or Aphrodite. The low crown, when fully rendered, is topped by a border of rosettes, although they sometimes degenerate into simple discs, which rather resemble lumpy crenellations (see p. 47). VOTIVE SHIELD V18 is a small fragment of a votive shield. A nearly complete terracotta shield of the same type from the Potters' Quarter58 shows that the subject is an apobates, an armed rider dismounting from his moving horse; the rider carries a small round shield of the same shape as the votive shield. All the preserved shields found in Corinth appear to have been made in the Potters' Quarter, where most were found. A fragmentary example found in the Tile Works, apparently brought there for dedication in a small shrine,59 has a better-preserved surface with fine linear detail for the horse's mane, a sign of metallic origin (see p. 81). Since both the apobates as a subject and votive shields in general have already been discussed in the literature in some detail, only a few points need be emphasized here. The connection with West Greece is quite strong, both in the selection of this subject and in style. To the already published citations now may be added a warrior's burial in Lanuvium, dating to the beginning of the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. This grave contained athletic equipment and a bronze disc incised with a similar "desultor."60 Discussion of another votive shield type from Medma61 indicates that the published dating of the Potters' Quarter shield to the end of the 6th century B.C. probably should be lowered at least to the first quarter of the 5th. A later date also would bring the Potters' Quarter shield into line with the other finds in the deposit in which it was found, Stele Shrine A. A shield brought to the Demeter sanctuary probably should be associated with hero cult, as already suggested for the banqueters (see pp. 67-68). There also may be some votive association with horse-rider figurines (see p. 60). RIDER PLAQUE V19 is a fragmentary rider plaque. This common Corinthian votive type, connected with hero cult, took the place of the handmade horse-rider figurines, which were made in the Potters' 55 Miller 1915, pp. 46-51, 87-88; D. B. Thompson 1954, pp. 99-103; Simon 1972, pp. 213-214; Monloup 1994, esp. p. 32. 56 On crenellations, see Nicholls 1958-1959, pp. 108-113. 57 For a Roman example from Corinth, see Edwards 1990, p. 531, pl. 83:a (S-802). 58 KN-1, Corinth XV, ii, pp. 227-228, no. 5, pls. 48, 49. 59 MF-8636: publication forthcoming by the author. 60 Colonna 1977, pp. 154-157, fig. 10, with bibliography; for the date, see p. 151.

Perhaps there is some connection with the scarcity at the sanctuary of later banqueter figurines (see p. 67), as if some change took place in the Early Hellenistic period with regard to the following of hero cult. VOTIVE OFFERINGS BROKEN FROM FIGURINES (V20-V26) The seven fragments V20-V26 are offerings broken from figurines of votaries of unknown types, all but one with the hands attached to the object; most of the hands are mitten shaped, like the hands of articulated "dolls" and some female figurines made at the Potters' Quarter (see, e.g., C122 and C33). In three cases (V20, V22, and V23), the mitten-shaped hand supports the offering, a cake or a dish of cakes, from beneath, indicating that the forearm must have been outstretched, and the figurine therefore could not have been an articulated "doll." In V21 two cakes are held at the edge by the thumb; the arm of an articulated "doll" (C122) holds a cake similarly. V24 holds a box in the flat of the hand but with the fingers curled around one edge. V26 is the only hand with fingers indicated, wrapped around an alabastron, apparently held at the side against the thigh. It is unclear whether the smooth surface represents the nude thigh of a male, since the smoothness could be attributed to a lack of folds at the side of a female figurine. V25, a rolled, narrow piece of cloth, perhaps a fillet, lacks a hand but is likely to have been attached to a figurine originally. Seven types of cakes are represented; only one of them, cake no. 5 below, corresponds closely to cakes shown on the model likna from the sanctuary,64 suggesting that the types of cakes offered in different rituals in the sanctuary may have varied. Only a few of the many sorts of cakes described in the ancient literature can be accurately identified in art, and there is a certain degree of confusion and overlap.65 The cakes held by the figurines are as follows: 1. A round, fat cake with a single flattened knob at the top (V20), perhaps a simple bun like a brioche. It may be the popanon monomphalon of the likna,66 but it is not as flat. Could this be similar to the kribanai, the Spartan breast-shaped cakes mentioned by Athenaios (14.646a [54]), eaten at women's banquets when the hymn in praise of a bride was sung? 2. A squarish, fat cake, divided into three segments and topped with two superimposed discs (V22). The most similar cake in the likna is the plakous, a fat cake filled with cheese and honey, but the examples there have either a single central knob and multiple segments or four segments and no knob at all.67 3. A round, flat disc covered with punch marks (V21). Irregular, stippled, flat masses in the likna have been identified as maza68 or porridge, but this cake is clearly stiff enough to be held upright in the hand; the punch marks may indicate seeds sprinkled over the surface. A similar flat cake was found at Perachora.69 4. A long, thin cake with tapered ends, appearing together with the punched disc in V21. Oblong cakes on the likna have been identified as fruit cakes, but there they are flattened; other long shapes are thought to represent wool, which would not be sufficiently stiff to be held as it is in the figurine.70 62 Corinth XII, pp. 49-50, nos. 308-319, pls. 27, 28; Broneer 1942, pp. 145, 148, fig. 7, upper right; Davidson 1942, pp. 110- 113, fig. 3:11-22. 63 Publication forthcoming. 64 For the cakes in the likna, see Brumfield 1997. 65 Grandjouan 1989, pp. 57-67, with bibliography. 66 Brumfield 1997, p. 150. 67 Brumfield 1997, pp. 151-152. 68 Brumfield 1997, pp. 152-154. 69 Perachora II, p. 328, no. 3445, pl. 130. 70 Brumfield 1997, p. 156.</page><page sequence="296">DISCUSSION 273 5. A plain, flat disc, placed in a bowl (V23) together with nos. 6 and 7. This cake closely resembles a type in the likna, the small discs called kollyba,71 although it seems to be larger. It also resembles the type of cake eaten by a Corinthian monkey in London72 and held in the hand of the articulated "doll" C122. 6. A conical cake, in the same bowl as nos. 5 and 7 and not represented on the likna. Conical or pyramidal cakes are frequently arranged with fruits or round cakes on the tables in funerary banquet reliefs and in this context would be sacred to chthonic deities.73 They could have been offered in the Acrocorinth sanctuary with a similar purpose. 7. A flat, oval cake, slashed down the top, in the same bowl as nos. 5 and 6. This is probably the most interesting of the cakes, since its resemblance to terracotta model vulvas from the Demeter sanctuary in Proerna74 suggests that it is an example of the aidoia, the genital-shaped cakes baked for fertility rituals elsewhere.75 If this cake has been correctly identified, could the cylindrical cake no. 4 represent the phallos? That three different sorts of cakes, nos. 5, 6, and 7, are placed together in one bowl may not be fortuitous and could have symbolic reference to different aspects of the cult. One can only attempt an interpretation, but the aidoion and the conical cake could refer to birth and death respectively; if the flat disc represents the sun76 and refers to life, the bowl could contain symbols of the entire life cycle. Generally speaking, in the context of a fertility cult, cakes may refer to children, if reproduction is taken as an analogue of baking (the "father's loaves").77 The offering in the hand of V24 is a box with a thin lid. It is perhaps parallel to the small chest that was associated with Persephone at Lokroi,78 although it is flatter and simpler than the chests usually represented with women in household and nuptial contexts.79 The box also has been recognized as a womb symbol.80 V25 probably represents a rolled, narrow cloth, such as a fillet. It is unknown how this fragment should be reconstructed on a figurine, but a Corinthian seated figurine in Athens unrolls on her lap what appears to be a narrow cloth,81 and a fragmentary draped, standing female figurine from Eutresis, thought to be a Corinthian import, holds a rolled fillet in the outstretched hand.82 One standing female figurine of reported Corinthian provenience holds both a rolled cloth and a small chest.83 There is epigraphic evidence that pieces of weaving were dedicated by women in other sanctuaries.84 Certainly such offerings would have been appropriate also in the Acrocorinth sanctuary, since the cult appears to have dealt with women's concerns.8 71 Brumfield 1997, pp. 149-150. 72 British Museum I, p. 260, no. 958, pl. 135. 73 For cakes represented in Totenmahlreliefs, see Thonges- Stringaris 1965, e.g., pls. 11:2, 20:2.

If so, he would have been bringing an offering appropriate to the chthonic deities (the rooster; see p. 269) together with a gift more appropriate to Aphrodite, as an object of beautification. In the Lokroi plaques, it is Aphrodite who is associated with the alabastron.86 Actual alabastra, however, are rare at the sanctuary.87 The pottery context of these two pieces is Classical, terminating in the last quarter of the 5th century B.C. MISCELLANEOUS FRAGMENTS (V27-V32) Included here are pieces of technical or typological interest that are too fragmentary to be assigned to specific sections of the discussion. V27 is a portion of the skirt folds of a large statuette, probably female. Its interest lies in the remains of paint, pink, red, and yellow over white slip, as well as gilding. The pattern made by the different colors can no longer be recovered, if indeed there was a pattern and not an impressionistic splashing of colors. Where the gilding has worn away, an underlying layer of yellow paint can be seen, probably employed to intensify the color of the gilding and to make any chipping of the gold paint less obvious (see pp. 13-14). The pottery context of this piece, from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Whatever the type originally represented, this fragment shows that very large, gilded, and presumably expensive statuettes were being made in Corinth, probably in the later 4th century B.C. V28 and V29 are merely a hand and a foot fragment respectively, but they are of statuette scale and of good quality. The slight remains of red paint show that the fragments originally belonged to male figurines. The shape of the break and the hollowing at the top of the foot suggest that it was added to the hem of a long garment, presumably the mantle of a semidraped type. Underpainting was used on the hand, this time pink under red. Both fragments are from the same pottery context as V27 and demonstrate that large male statuettes of good quality were being dedicated during the 4th century B.C. The smaller foot V30 does not show any red paint but must belong to a nude male type, since the leg is bare above the ankle. This foot, from the same pottery context as the three foregoing fragments, is of excellent fabric and is well detailed anatomically, showing that the molds of 4th-century B.C. male figurines were sometimes taken from archetypes made by highly skilled artisans. V31 is the outspread wing of a creature, perhaps Eros or Nike, in flight. The wing is different in form, however, from those of the Eros H289, the only one with the wings well preserved. The wings of the fragmentary Nike H295 are not preserved. V32, a sleeved arm with a clenched, pierced hand that originally held something, is all that remains of a type of which nothing else is preserved in the sanctuary. The sleeve suggests an Oriental costume, perhaps worn by a rider holding the reins of his horse. Another possibility is that the arm belonged to an actor wearing a sleeved costume. BASES AND SUPPORTS (V33-V43) In this section are discussed Classical and Hellenistic figurine bases of different shapes, preserved either alone or with only slight remains of the bottom of the figure, as well as supports of various types preserved without the figures that leaned on them. The bases discussed here were made separately and attached to the figurines, but similarly shaped bases could also be molded together 86 Sourvinou-Inwood 1978, p. 105. 87 Corinth XVIII, i, p. 53.</page><page sequence="298">DISCUSSION 275 with the torso, particularly in derivative production (e.g., H120). Sometimes only the upper part of the base was molded, while the bottom was added by hand (e.g., H109). CLASSICAL BASES The bases of Classical figurines and their survivals from the Acrocorinth sanctuary are rectangular. They are found in several variants: low and straight sided, as in C20; low and slightly splaying, as in C19; or high and splaying, as in C26. When the back of the figurine is handmade, the back of the base may be rounded off, presumably to simplify construction, as in C19 and H146. All these bases are plain, without any moldings. The highest of the rectangular bases is V36, which splays into a flat, spreading foot. This well-made variant is likely to be of 4th-century B.C. date; it is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. A two-stepped rectangular base type is preserved only in isolation in the sanctuary; V33 is a complete base of this type, and there are fragmentary examples as well, from pottery contexts containing both Classical and later material. The type may have been copied from small bronzes, since two-stepped rectangular bases were used for bronzes in the Archaic and Early Classical periods.88 This base type, however, may not have been used for terracotta figurines until later; a 4th-century B.C. Corinthian terracotta Aphrodite in Berlin of the type of H24989 has a base of this type. Sometimes the lower step is quite low, as in a Corinthian figurine of a woman with a duck in Berlin,90 recalling the use of a rectangular base set on a low plaque to support small bronzes.91 V33 is handmade, and the two steps are clearly differentiated, but when figurines with two-stepped bases were reproduced in subsequent generations, the clear definition of the two steps appears to have been lost, and the lower step survives merely as a flat molding at the bottom of the base, as in V34. The top of this base was closed up from inside with a strip of clay, as if to imitate the solid top of a separately made base, and was then punched with holes for venting. The more elaborate V35 is a high, rectangular base with moldings at the top and bottom. Since only one side is preserved, it is not certain whether it originally was a large base for a statuette or a long, narrow base suitable for a figurine with a strongly horizontal composition, such as H65, with its wide drapery fall at the side. A high base such as this one would go far toward correcting the rather stocky proportions and flat-footed look of H65 and others like it. The excellent fabric of V35 should date it to the 4th century B.C.; it is from a pottery context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C. The simplest form of base is the abbreviated plaque on which some 5th-century B.C. figurines stand, for example, C10. These bases usually were molded together with the torso. They can be compared with, and probably were modeled after, similar small plinths on Archaic bronze statuettes,92 but while the bronzes were probably meant to be attached to something else, a plinth of this kind on a figurine appears to have been the entire base. HELLENISTIC BASES While the base types discussed above sometimes continued to be used into the Hellenistic period for figurines of surviving Classical types, two new base types are typically Hellenistic, the spool and the plaque. The spool base is well known elsewhere in terracotta figurines of the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C.93 and must be derived from bases employed for small bronzes, as in an Aphrodite in Boston.94 The best examples of spool bases are wheelmade and of good fabric, with 88 E.g., Neugebauer 1931, pp. 79-80, no. 180, pl. 28; Mat- tusch 1988, p. 114, fig. 5.12. 89 Winter, Typen II, p. 93, no. 6. 90 Kriseleit and Zimmer 1994, p. 112, no. 31; the drawing in Winter, Typen II, p. 7, no. 5, omits the bottom step. 91 E.g., Rolley 1986, pp. 100-101, fig. 70; p. 137, fig. 118. 92 E.g., Rolley 1986, p. 106, figs. 76, 77. 93 E.g., Langlotz and Hirmer 1965, pp. 298-299, pls. 149, 151, dated Late Hellenistic; pp. 248-249, color pls. XVII, XVIII, dated to the 2nd century B.C. 94 Comstock and Vermeule 1971, pp. 64-65, no. 65.</page><page sequence="299">276 CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC VARIA sharply defined edges; the bases are either straight sided, as in V37, or concave sided and wider at the bottom, as in V38. More often, the spool base appears in its narrower form, not wheelmade but handmade, or moldmade together with its figurine, and with thicker, less clearly defined flat or torus moldings at the top and bottom. Several examples of such bases have been preserved in the sanctuary complete with their figurines (e.g., the votaries H9 and H10 and the boy H331). These fully formed spool bases should not be confused with the early-4th-century semicircular type that looks like a spool in front but is flat in back.95 The relationship between the two types is unclear. The base of H101 is a hybrid; it has the semicircular form, but it is also set on a plaque base. The thin plaque base is known elsewhere mainly in "Tanagra" figurines96 and appears in the sanctuary in the isolated base V39 and in such small, "Tanagra"-like pieces as H104 and H122. These bases were made separately; the figurine was attached by pressing down a part of the garment hem toward the back. A ridge on the surface of V39 near one corner is all that remains of the hem of the missing figurine. This base has a hole cut at the center for venting, but the complete figurines are uncut at the bottom. The small H104 apparently was not vented at all and may have been solid; H122 could have been vented in the missing upper part of the torso. The last base (V40) is rather puzzling. It appears to represent a kind of shelf like a console, on which the figurine stands, as a larger piece might be displayed on a real shelf fastened to a wall.97 An animal relief decorates the front of the shelf, between the two projections of the console. SUPPORTS V41 and V42 are herm supports broken from the left sides of figurines of unknown type. The one complete figurine leaning on a herm support (H79) is a standing female, draped in a voluminous mantle. Since the herm support is placed at the right side rather than the left, the isolated herms cannot belong to this figurine type. V41 has lost detail and preserves only the main outlines; V42 preserves only the head, but it can be identified through complete parallels.98 The style of V42 is Early Classical, the two smooth shocks of hair framing the forehead resembling the coiffure of C103. The style of the herm support, however, does not necessarily date the figurine, which probably belonged to the 4th century B.C. or later, when such supports were popular. Another old-fashioned type to serve as a support is the archaizing female figure, of which V43 is an example. While the fragment is not well preserved, the peplos arrangement is roughly similar to that of the archaizing figurine from the sanctuary H52. MOLDS (V44-V46) Five fragments of molds were found in the sanctuary, three of which (V44-V46) are sufficiently well preserved to be identifiable in type. V44 represents a female figure holding a piglet across her chest. The lower part of the piglet and the forearm that originally supported it from below apparently were rendered in a separate mold, since the lower edge of V44 is finished. The complete type probably was similar to one of the votaries carrying a piglet, such as H9, but in larger scale. Its pottery context, which terminates in the early 3rd century B.C., is too early for the later-3rd-century "priestess" type (p. 254). The fragment V45 shows only a draped left breast 95 As in Boeotian figurines, British Museum I, pp. 229-230, nos. 862-864, pl. 123. 96 Kleiner 1984, e.g., pls. 1-5; on the introduction of this base type for "Tanagras" in Athens, based on metallic sources, see D. B. Thompson 1966, p. 54. 97 The available evidence for shelves, however, suggests that they were very simply constructed and used mainly for utilitarian objects: Richter 1966, pp. 78-79. 98 E.g., Lindos I, col. 567, no. 2340, pl. 110.</page><page sequence="300">CATALOGUE 277 and a few adjacent folds, which may belong to a mantle draped over the shoulder and upper arm. V46 is part of a wing mold, from near the attachment to the body, presumably of such a figure as Eros or Nike; it is from a pottery context terminating in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C. While these types are suitable for dedication in the sanctuary, it is curious that they appear in the form of molds. Figurines and other votives may well have been sold from booths within the sanctuary,99 but there is no evidence for a workshop there. Indeed, the scarcity of water and probably wood in the immediate vicinity would have made the location impractical for a workshop. Perhaps coroplasts or their families offered molds, just as herdsmen or farmers dedicated figurines of animals, to ensure the success of their labors.

Sometimes the fabrics and iconography of these figurines are sufficient to reveal the sources without much doubt. Most of the Argive and Attic figurines, for example, can be attributed with some confidence. The sources of a few figurines have been identified definitively by scholars visiting Corinth and have served as guides to identify others. Ideally, the sources of imported figurines should be pinpointed on the basis of both fabric and type. Sometimes, however, published typological parallels are lacking for figurines that seem to be of identifiable fabric. In these cases, the figurines are included provisionally under their likely sources. When the sources of figurines of non-Corinthian fabric are not clearly recognizable, they have been grouped together at the end of this chapter, to avoid possibly misleading attributions. It is hoped that they will eventually be identified by students of other coroplastic centers. The most troublesome figurines are those that might be called "anomalous Corinthian"; their fabric may resemble Corinthian to a certain degree, yet they are not convincingly local and have therefore been included under the category of figurines of uncertain provenience. The problem of identifying such figurines is exacerbated by the large number of workshops that appear to have been active in Corinth, some perhaps only for a short time and varying greatly in the quality of their output (see p. 19). Are marginal fabrics just poor local work not up to standard for some reason? Corinth was such a prolific center of all sorts of terracotta products that one might expect a certain amount of marginal or opportunistic activity, outside the main workshops, by people with sufficient expertise to produce some figurines to sell at a festival, without having access to the best materials or facilities. Or perhaps such figurines were made in other northern Peloponnesian communities with access to similar clays, in imitation of Corinthian work. For example, three figurines (160, 165, and 186) are thick-walled and heavy for their relatively small size. Their fabric is of convincingly Corinthian color but is sandy in texture, which is not normal for most Corinthian work. On the basis of their technical similarities to one another, it seems possible to assign them to a common workshop. 160 is of a distinctly Corinthian type, a youthful peplophoros with her arms at her sides, and may be mechanically related to H37, which is of Corinthian fabric. One might be tempted to say that sand was added to the clay by a local craftsman, perhaps in response to a temporary shortage of better material. Yet 165 has a probable mold sibling (166) in a fabric that does not look at all Corinthian. Further, its type, as well as that of I86, is not convincingly Corinthian. Two other "anomalous" figurines, the dancer 172 and the female head 174, are of fabric that could be Corinthian but is coarser than normal because of the use of organic temper, which has burned out, leaving voids. Since this practice is unusual for Corinthian coroplasts, such figurines may have been made in neighboring workshops, if they were not simply marginal local work. The female head 179 presents a different scenario; its fabric is very like the Corinthian fabric 1 (see p. 11), and its facial type could be local, but the tooling of the hair differs from local work in its stiffness and dryness and in the tendency to pattern the hair geometrically. Such tooling is more typical, perhaps, of Megarian work (see p. 297). Seen beside Corinthian heads, 179 stands apart. Perhaps such figurines were not made in workshops in Corinth itself, but were</page><page sequence="306">284 CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC IMPORTED FIGURINES; EXTERNAL RELATIONS made sufficiently nearby to obtain clay with physical properties similar to the Corinthian clay and perhaps Corinthian workshop materials; the workshop practices might well have differed enough, however, to produce figurines that were not entirely Corinthian in appearance, even when Corinthian molds were employed. Still other "anomalous" pieces discussed below, under the category of figurines of uncertain provenience, show other departures from the expected local techniques, so that the total number of imported figurines with little or no connection to Corinthian workshops is somewhat reduced. Looking to the nearby larger sites, figurines appear to have been manufactured at Isthmia, where molds of Corinthian fabric have been found.1 Some of the figurines found at Isthmia seem to be Corinthian imports,2 but others may have been made locally of clay similar in appearance to Corinthian. For example, an ephedrismos figurine3 is of a type closely paralleled in the Demeter sanctuary (see pp. 200-201), but it apparently was constructed by pressing a thin layer of fine clay into the mold and backing this layer with slightly coarser material, so that the surface layer has in part flaked away. This method of construction is unusual in Corinth itself for Hellenistic figurines of this relatively small scale, being more characteristic of terracotta sculpture. Its use may suggest a scarcity of the finest grade of clay in some places outside the main center.4 It is unfortunate that we know little of the coroplastic industries of Megara and Sikyon, since one might expect imports from those cities. Two pieces from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, the above-mentioned female head 179 and the male figurine 184, resemble figurines of reported Megarian provenience in retouch or construction (see pp. 297, 298), but they do not resemble one another in fabric. The Classical and Early Hellenistic figurines from the Sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas at Epidauros include many Argive and Corinthian, some of good quality, and other more modest pieces that could be of local manufacture.5 The inhabitants of any small village in the Corinthia, however, assuming they possessed the necessary skills, materials, and firing facilities, conceivably could have produced figurines for festivals, even in the absence of major coroplastic activity. In such cases, we may never know the precise sources.6 Finally, because of the difficulty in some cases in drawing a distinction between Corinthian and non-Corinthian, or in identifying fabrics that have been burned, there are a few figurines that have been catalogued and discussed among the main body of Corinthian figurines, although there is a slight doubt about their origin (e.g., H247). NUMBERS OF IMPORTS AND THE TRADE IN FIGURINES An effort was made to take note, on the basis of fabric, of all figurines of identifiable types that could have been imported. The total number of imports of the Classical and Hellenistic periods is 115, including catalogued figurines and duplicates in the lots accounted for under the catalogued entries; there are probably a few imports of the Roman period as well, although in the present state of knowledge they cannot be identified (see p. 313). Adding the approximately 50 imports recorded for the Archaic period,7 it is apparent that imported figurines constitute only a tiny fraction of the total number found in the sanctuary (see pp. 2-4). This is hardly surprising, 1 Anderson-Stojanovic 1993, p. 269. 2 Anderson-Stojanovic 1993, pp. 268-269; Anderson- Stojanovic 1996, p. 89; Mitten 1962. 3 Anderson-Stojanovic 1993, p. 288, no. 79, pl. 63. 4 Other, coarser fabrics are represented at Isthmia as well, including one similar to the Corinthian "tile fabric" (Mitten 1962 [1963, p. 309]), which was not used for figurines in Corinth. 5 Peppa-Papaioannou 1985. 6 The "Corinthian periphery" described in Nicholls 1995, p. 425, note 84, includes work that can now be assigned to Corinth itself, as well as figurines thought to have been made by itinerant Corinthian craftsmen elsewhere, even as far away as Athens. This concept, which is not employed in the present study, should not be confused with the problem at hand, which is largely a matter of geographical propinquity. 7 Publication forthcoming.</page><page sequence="307">DISCUSSION 285 given the very large local production. There are fewer imports datable to the 5th and early 4th centuries B.C. than to the Archaic and Early Hellenistic periods, but local copies ofRhodian and Attic Classical female types (C103 and C104), and the strong influence of Tarentine banqueter figurines (see p. 66), show that Corinthian coroplasts must have had either imported figurines or molds. Under what circumstances did these figurines reach Corinth? With regard to actual com- merce, one should probably think in terms of small-scale, opportunistic trade (see below), by vendors taking advantage of festivals to sell a few baskets of figurines of appropriate types in the market or at the sanctuary itself. Another factor would have been the casual importation of figurines by individuals, without the intention of trading them, just as modern pilgrims collect small souvenirs of a religious nature at the holy sites they visit. For the Classical and Hellenistic periods (including both catalogued figurines and duplicates in the lots), the Argive imports are the most numerous, at 38 figurines; there are 21 identified Attic imports, 10 Boeotian, 5 Rhodian, and 2 West Greek. The remaining imported figurines are from a variety of unknown sources; including the "anomalous Corinthian" figurines, this category numbers 39. Some of these are likely to be East Greek, the uncertainty stemming from the lack of available comparative material to help identify fabrics. Compared to the imports of the Archaic period, there is more Boeotian and less Rhodian.8 The trade with Argos was probably the best organized, since there are mold multiples or later generations of several head types (e.g., 19, see catalogue) among the figurines from the sanctuary. This is not true of any of the other imported fabrics, although the Rhodian protome 152 has a possible mold sibling in the Corinth collection. It should be possible to apply to the Corinthian imports the model for the trade in Archaic figurines developed by Uhlenbrock for the very large number of imports at the Sanctuary of Demeter at Cyrene;9 here, three forms of commerce appear to have been operative: the bulk trade, in which a cargo of substantial size would be delivered by commission directly to a site; the basket trade, in which a relatively small number of figurines would have accompanied a more important cargo, perhaps to take advantage of potential sales at a specific festival; and an indirect form of trade called the "bazaar" trade, in which small transactions along the route would have resulted in the gradual dispersal of the original inventory and the acquisition of new figurines for sale further on. These three forms of trade are reflected in the numbers of figurines from individual workshops arriving at the destination, most especially the number of duplicates from the same molds. The bulk trade would result in a substantial number of mold duplicates, and the basket trade in fewer; the bazaar trade would bring figurines technically unrelated to one another, from a variety of sources. While the numbers of imports at Corinth are much smaller than at Cyrene, owing to the large local production, it seems fair to describe the figurine trade with Argos as basket trade, since there are a few Argive mold duplicates. The relatively short trip from Argos to Corinth with a donkey-load of figurines is not hard to imagine, particularly with a sure market at a festival at the end of the journey. Understandably, there are no signs of bulk trade in figurines to Corinth, although Corinthian figurines traveled elsewhere in that manner. The assortment of fabrics and types among the group of unknown provenience, however, suggests either the operation of the bazaar trade or the casual carrying of figurines by individuals, as suggested above. The same is likely to be true of the small group of West Greek figurines. Although there is one mold connection of a Boeotian figurine from the sanctuary with one in the Corinth collection, there is otherwise a great disparity 8 Archaic imports: 18 Argive, 12 Rhodian, 8 other East Greek, 7 Attic, 3 West Greek, 1 Boeotian, and 3 of uncertain provenience; this information was kindly provided byJean M. Turfa. 9 Uhlenbrock 1985.</page><page sequence="308">286 CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC IMPORTED FIGURINES; EXTERNAL RELATIONS within this group and no sense of coherent workshops. Similarly, among the Attic imports there is a considerable range of types, no mold duplicates, and no close parallels among the few Attic imports found elsewhere in Corinth. Once again, either the bazaar trade was operative or at least part of this diverse material consists of casual imports by individuals. THE IMPORTED FIGURINES The imported figurines are discussed below by place of origin, in order of their abundance at the sanctuary, beginning with the Argive. Within each group, the organization follows that used for the Corinthian figurines. The relatively small number of Classical imports are discussed first, then the more abundant Early Hellenistic and survivals in the following order: female votaries, other female types, female heads, deities, males, children, other types (actors, protomes, animals, etc.). All but a few of the imported figurines find general typological parallels among the Corinthian figurines from the sanctuary, indicating a degree of selection to conform to local custom. ARGIVE FIGURINES (11-122) Some members of this group, as indicated in the catalogue, have been identified as Argive by Martin Guggisberg. The fabric of these figurines, particularly 17, has been used as a basis of comparison to suggest an Argive origin for the remaining figurines, including a few for which no exact typological parallels have been published. The typical fabric is orange (5YR 6/6) in color and rather coarse in texture, with some small dark and sparkling inclusions and some voids. The fabric of the better-made and less-worn figurines, such as I10 and Ill, is slightly finer in texture. The above-mentioned likelihood of a basket trade in Argive figurines at Corinth is strength- ened by the observation that Argive imports include three types specific to this sanctuary: female votaries carrying piglets (II, 16-18); the "priestess" type (122); and the head of a boy (121), which is mechanically related to the Corinthian boy with a goose (H331). The presence of these types, among the most popular at the sanctuary, points to a deliberate selection of figurines known to be saleable. Five of the Argive figurines (11-15) are datable stylistically to the Classical period. II preserves only part of the right side of a female figurine, showing the overlapping folds of the open side of the peplos and the hand holding what could be the rear leg of a piglet. Since there is no sign of the peplos overfold on the preserved part of the torso, it must have been short, the type perhaps resembling the Corinthian Classical votary with a piglet C1. 12 is the upper part of a peplos-figurine, which can be completed by examples from Argos and Tiryns.10 In the original design, the left arm is extended to carry a plate with a votive cake.11 The head type is similar to 14; it has the large, earthy features familiar among some Corinthian faces. Two further heads of this type were noted in the lots (see catalogue). A Classical rather than Hellenistic date for 12 is suggested by the broad shoulders, the nearly plain overfold with very light catenaries, and the framing of the upper arms with drapery. The parallel from Argos is dated to the third quarter of the 5th century B.C., but the peaked coiffure should bring the date down to the early 4th century B.C. 13 is the lower part of a different peplophoros type, dated to the Classical period by virtue of the omega folds at the hem of the overfold, probably dropping from the breasts, as in the Corinthian C36, and the very straight skirt folds. The overfold hem lifts at the left side, and the open side of the peplos is parted, as if in response to a raised left arm. The isolated head 10 Guggisberg 1988, pp. 197-198, 230, no. 55, fig. 11; Tiryns I, p. 80, no. 120, pl. XII:7. 1 Tiryns I, pp. 79-80 on the cake.</page><page sequence="309">DISCUSSION 287 15 has a Classical look in its large features that seem to fill the face, its level, widely opened eyes, and the smoothly rounded coiffure. 16-18 are variations of a votary type wearing the peplos and carrying a piglet diagonally across the torso; there are six additional examples of similar type in the lots, making the votary type with a piglet the most popular of the Argive imports. Its meaning at the Acrocorinth sanctuary must have been the same as that of the Corinthian votaries carrying piglets (see pp. 117-124). These figurines belong to a traditional Argive type dating back to the 5th century B.C. and are thought to have concluded by the early 4th.12 The poor quality, dull impressions, and narrow-shouldered proportions of 17 and 18, however, suggest that degenerate renderings of the type persisted at least until the later 4th century B.C. 17 is a poorer version of a variant found at Speliotaki.13 16 is the best in quality of the examples of this group from the Demeter sanctuary, and on stylistic grounds it should be the earliest. An example of this variant from Tiryns, in which the left elbow pulls the mantle down like a sling, has a head similar to I9.14 The good quality of this head indicates that better renderings of these votaries were exported to Corinth as well. There are three additional examples of this head type (see catalogue). The coiffure of 19 clings closely to the head and neck, as if veiled.15 The features are delicate, the eyes are small, and the mouth is narrow and thin lipped. I10, which is muffled in a mantle and carries a ball or fruit, could, in the context of the Demeter sanctuary, represent a bride; this figurine has a close parallel from Argos. 16 The subject of another draped female figurine (112) is known from a better-preserved example in Argos;17 the mantle is wrapped closely around the shoulders, covering the bent right arm and hand; the left elbow is propped on the support, and the hand, as in I10, holds a ball or fruit. Ill, with the hand on the hip and the mantle lifted behind the left shoulder in a gesture of unveiling (see pp. 36, 149, 174) and tucked between the thighs, probably represents Aphrodite; the type is known in other examples from Argos,18 with a head similar to 14, which is also known on a peplophoros type (see 12). While the clinging drapery and fine folds of these draped female types are survivals of Attic Rich Style, the figurines are unlikely to date earlier than the later 4th century B.C., because of their narrow, sloping shoulders. I10 and I1 could have been made in the same workshop. Although they are different from one another in type, they share compositions in which the figure leans on a pillar at the left side. They both have finely folded, closely clinging garments, narrow, sloping shoulders, and high, cuplike breasts. They have trailing hems over pointed shoes, and the bases are rendered in the mold together with the torso. 112, which is somewhat smaller, shares these characteristics as far as it is preserved and may belong to the same workshop group. The head 14 shows tool marks similar to those on I11 and could perhaps be brought into the group as well. The fragment 113, which shows the mantle curving over the thigh and probably tucked between the thighs, could be an Aphrodite type similar in part to Ill1. In this case, the composition includes a cluster of folds of uncertain purpose beside the right hip. Its good quality should place it in the 4th century B.C., and indeed it was found in the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. 12 Guggisberg 1988, pp. 222-225, for a summary of the development of Argive figurines.

H260), and the Aphrodite or Leda 116, lifting the mantle with the right arm (cf. H257). A 4th-century B.C. date is likely for both; 114 was found with 4th-century B.C. pottery, and 116 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The fragmentary 115 could be another such Aphrodite or Leda, since the right side of the torso is framed with folds, perhaps of a mantle lifted at that side. The sturdy proportions of the torso point to a 4th-century B.C. date. The nearly nude 114 shares a distinctive motif with the fragmentary 117, although the latter wears a chiton beneath the mantle; in both, the mantle is folded down at the hip, and this short overfold is held out in the right hand. Although the two figurines are not mechanically related, they may have been developed from related archetypes. 117 is from a pottery context terminating in the early 3rd century B.C. The mantled dancer 118 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The general type is known in the Demeter sanctuary in a number of Corinthian examples (H153-H169). Two isolated Argive female heads cannot be connected with any of the torso types preserved at the sanctuary. The hair of 120 is simply parted in the front in the Classical manner and clings closely to the neck. The coiffure of 119, which is peaked in a braid above the forehead and has a cluster of curls on the cranium, has familiar Corinthian elements but in a combination unusual in Corinth.19 The head, which is of 4th-century B.C. style, is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Three poor, worn female heads of possible Argive fabric in lots 2239, 3217, and 6214 are of uncertain type. The head in lot 2239 seems to have drapery lifted behind the left shoulder. The head in lot 3217 may be a distorted version of 14; it is only half the size and, if Argive, would demonstrate that at least one type continued to be made very late in a degenerate form. The head in lot 6214 is larger, but it may also be a degenerate example of the same type. The first two heads have peaked coiffures. 121 is one of the most interesting of the Argive figurines, since it appears to be of Argive fabric but nevertheless looks like a mold sibling of a 3rd-century B.C. Corinthian type popular at the sanctuary, the boy with a goose (H331). Since it is unlikely that the Corinthians would have imported the rather coarse Argive clay for figurines, when their own clay was much finer and paler, the best explanation is that an Argive workshop acquired a Corinthian mold collateral to the one used for H331 and with it produced a type known to be saleable in Corinth. A lingering Archaic spoon-based protome (MF-12891)20 is an earlier example of a popular Corinthian type in Argive fabric, probably made in an imported mold. The import of Corinthian molds is documented for Athens (see p. 32), Isthmia (see p. 284), and Lakonia,21 but the return to Corinth of the resulting products is so far not known for other sites. The exchange of coroplastic workshop materials between Corinth and Argos is paralleled by their brisk trade in Hellenistic molded relief bowls and the consequent sharing of designs.22 122 is another 3rd-century B.C. Corinthian type specifically associated with the Demeter sanctuary, the "priestess" type (pp. 250-255). Only the upper part is preserved, but the type, with its thick torch, polos, and chubby face, is unmistakable. In this case, however, there are no mechanical relatives in Corinthian fabric. Probably the corresponding Corinthian mold relatives have not been found, since the piece bears too many resemblances in details to the Corinthian versions to be an entirely free copy created at another site. One of the imported figurines included with those of uncertain provenience, the archaizing support 195, could possibly be ofArgive fabric. 19 Cf. Guggisberg 1988, pp. 206-207, 231, no. 79, fig. 15, there dated to the mid-4th century B.C. 20 Publication forthcoming. 21 Salapata 1997. 22 Edwards 1981, pp. 201-202.</page><page sequence="311">DISCUSSION 289 In addition to the imported figurines, connections with Argos can be adduced by other means. The Corinthian head H246 (see p. 169) could have been mechanically copied from an Argive figurine similar to 19. Another possible copy of an Argive type is the Aphrodite H254 (see p. 173), which, as far as it is preserved, closely parallels 114. Further, Argive workshops may have provided the sanctuary worshipers with figurines of votaries carrying piglets during the later 5th and much of the 4th century B.C., until new Corinthian types were developed in the Early Hellenistic period (see pp. 117-124). ATTIC FIGURINES (123-142) The fabric of figurines made in Athens is quite distinctive. Its shade of orange can be closely matched on the Munsell charts as 5YR 6/6. At its best (as in 124) it is a fine fabric, with a polished surface; when examined closely in bright sunlight, it reveals an abundance of extremely small sparkling inclusions. A few examples (e.g., 128) are paler on the outer surface, sometimes through the application of a slip. In a number of examples the texture is slightly coarser. A few figurines (e.g., 140) are orange-buff rather than orange in color, but since they have the abundant small sparkling inclusions typical of the orange figurines, they have been assigned to Athens. The attributions include types that have not previously been recorded for Athens, but they have been catalogued here nevertheless on the basis of their fabric. Unlike the Argive figurines, there are no mold duplicates and no clear workshop groupings among the twenty-one imports attributed to Athens. It was suggested above (p. 286) that the diversity among the Attic figurines points to casual imports by individuals or perhaps to the bazaar trade rather than an organized trade in figurines directly from Athens. The types generally correspond with the local offerings; however, fully one-third of the Attic figurines represent children, a significant proportion suggesting that, to the extent that these figurines may have been carried to Corinth by Athenian visitors to the sanctuary, rituals concerning children may have been the focus of interest. After the Archaic period, for which seven Attic imports are recorded from the sanctuary,23 the earliest would be the fragmentary hydriaphoros 123, which has a well-known Attic facial type.24 The absence of earlier Classical Attic imports is probably an accident of discovery, since two Corinthian figurines (C104 and C277) seem to be local copies taken mechanically from Attic figurines of that period, presupposing the presence of imports. All the remaining Attic imports are probably Early Hellenistic in date. Three figurines (124-126) should be classified as early "Tanagras." While they are not identical in composition, as far as they are preserved, to published examples of known Athenian provenience, they are of convincing style and workmanship for this group.25 The fabric of 125 is slightly coarser than the other two, but it still seems to be Attic. On the basis of the Athenian evidence, they should date to the last quarter of the 4th century B.C.; 125 is from a pottery context of the 4th to early 3rd century B.C. 127, with the mantle wrapped shawl-like around the shoulders, is a member of a group of figurines of heavily draped young girls that prefigures the "Tanagra" types, although without their elegance.26 Figurines of this group are recognizable by their thick, meaty folds, blunt modeling, and rather slapdash retouch. 127 has parallels from the Athenian Agora.27 128 is another, of ambiguous gender but identifiable as a girl through a parallel from the Pnyx.28 This figurine shows in an exaggerated form a motif of some early 23 Publication forthcoming. 24 Kindly attributed by Richard V Nicholls to the CD Group, early Rich Style, corr.

Although the breasts of this figure are developed, the short-waisted proportions contribute a girlish look; perhaps this figurine represented a young votary. The mantled figurine 130 is probably standing, although the slight flare of the drapery fall at the left side leaves open the possibility that it represents a mantled dancer; Corinthian dancers are sometimes identifiable by the flaring drapery (cf. H160). The strongly sloping shoulders of 130 speak for a 3rd-century B.C. date; the pottery context of this figurine terminates in the third quarter of the 3rd century B.C. 131 is a puzzling fragment of the front of a mantled figurine, presumably a woman, but it is not entirely clear which part of the figure is preserved. Perhaps the looped folds are drawn across the abdomen and originally were held at the hip in the right hand; in this case, the left thigh is strongly advanced, perhaps in a dance. Alternatively, we have the narrow, sloping shoulders of the figure swathed in the mantle, with the left forearm extended. In either case, the delicacy of the folds is noteworthy. Two isolated female heads (132 and 133) wear the melon coiffure. 33 has a childlike quality because of the round face and widely opened eyes. The faces of young girls with this coiffure, however, are usually smiling.30 The break just beneath the chin suggests either that the neck was as short as a child's or, more likely, that a mantle was wrapped closely under the chin. Two of the imported Attic figurines (134 and 135) represent youths. 134 is just a fragment of the right side, but the drapery arrangement and pattern of folds correspond well with a better- made figurine of a mantled youth from Tanagra, of similar scale, dated ca. 330-300 B.C.31 The folds are slightly diagonal to reflect the youth's movement to his left side. 134 may have been made from a mold related to the youth from Tanagra, but it has been awkwardly retouched, and a diagonal fold has been added over the hand. The other figurine of a youth (135) preserves only the booted bare right leg crossed over the left. Since the thigh is completely bare, he probably wore only a chlamys. He seems to be leaning against a rocky support. Several of the figurines discussed above may represent young girls, but the seven pieces following are definitely children. 136 is a baby reaching up, generally corresponding in type to the Corinthian Classical C236. 136, however, which reaches up with both arms, is more advanced in style. The figurines of children include types that are paralleled among the finds from the Assembly Place filling III of the Pnyx; the lower chronological limit of this material is 326 B.C., but it is thought to contain figurines of the first half of the 4th century B.C.32 Two figurines with parallels from the Pnyx are the seated nude boy I3733 and the wreathed head I38.34 In the example from the Pnyx, the wreathed head type belongs to a mantled figurine thought to represent a girl. Such heads are also known from Menon's cistern, where they belong to figurines of cloaked boys.35 The seated boy corresponds with the Corinthian boys H335-H338 (see p. 191), and the wreathed head to H350 (see p. 193). Of the remaining children, the fragmentary 139 probably represents a semidraped child, to judge from the chubby, childlike arm and hand, but Corinthian versions such as H320 use the mantle as a side 29 Cf.

It is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The remaining head (141) is poorly preserved, but the round face is that of a child, wearing a small, flat headdress of uncertain type and drawing the mantle over the chin.36 The head is from a pottery context of the late 4th century B.C. The remaining Attic import is a figurine of an actor (142), identifiable by the padded costume, although exact parallels are hard to pinpoint because of the loss of the head and attributes. With the left arm akimbo, and the himation caught in the belt at the right side, the type, as far as preserved, resembles one in which the actor lifts the himation at the right side,37 in an apparent parody of a woman's unveiling gesture. This type is placed in the second quarter of the 4th century B.C. On the general question of coroplastic give-and-take between Corinth and Athens, see pages 32-33. The situation is somewhat clouded by the pervasive nature of Attic stylistic influence, particularly in the representation of drapery, in the arts of the Classical period. This influence need not have reached Corinthian workshops through coroplastic channels. Apart from the imported figurines, connections with Attic coroplastic work of the Classical period can be seen in two Corinthian figurines that may have been mechanically copied from Attic imports, the female head C104 (see p. 48) and the Pan C277 (see pp. 78-79). The same may be true of the draped articulated dancer C181 (see pp. 59-60); since the detail of the drapery is quite clear, however, the "doll" may have been made in an imported mold. Derivation from Attic figurine vases is possible for the Asiatic dancer C281 (see p. 80) and the Dionysos mask C269 (see pp. 76-77). The seated female figurine C80 (see p. 44) could have been made in a mold collateral to that of a figurine from the Pnyx; unfortunately, the latter is burned, and therefore the fabric cannot be identified as Attic with certainty. For the Hellenistic period, one might expect a local series of copies of female "Tanagra" types, but instead there are only a few scattered examples. Rather, one finds a general reflection of the "Praxitelean" stylistic underpinning of "Tanagra" figurines in types of a different nature (see p. 115). The most convincing female "Tanagras" are the seated woman H175 (see p. 157) and the heads H217-H220 (see pp. 164-165) and H243-H245 (see pp. 168-169). It is not possible, however, to isolate the specific sources, and it is not always clear whether one should look toward Attic or Boeotian workshops; perhaps the latter, since one fragmentary standing "Tanagra" (H117) can almost certainly be connected with a Boeotian workshop, and exchange of workshop materials between Corinthian and Boeotian workshops is demonstrable for other Hellenistic types as well (see p. 201). In the case of dancer figurines, the sources of two derivative Corinthian types could be either Attic or Boeotian workshops: see the discussion of H153 (pp. 153-154) and H164 (pp. 154-155). Two other dancer types (H156 [see p. 154], and H165 and H166 [see p. 155]) are likely to have been of Attic inspiration, the latter perhaps through metalwork. Another piece possibly from Attic metalwork is the female head H248 (see p. 169). While the above connections are sometimes speculative, the use of Attic figurines of actors is clear. H355-H364 (see pp. 195-196) are copies or adaptations of Attic figurines. One final area in which Athenian influence, although less direct, can be pointed out is in the relief figures on the polos V14 (see p. 270). These figures are closely connected with reliefs on arulae that are thought to have originated in Athens. 36 Cf. a fully preserved figurine of a boy in a kausia and chlamys drawn over his chin: Ruhfel 1984, p. 205, pl. 83. 37 Webster 1978, p. 73, no.

Ten Classical and Hellenistic figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary can be attributed to Boeotia with some confidence on the basis of fabric and, in most cases, type as well; there is one Archaic Boeo- tian import.39 The fabric is somewhat coarse, with dark and/or white and sometimes sparkling inclusions. The color varies; using the terminology adopted here for the Corinthian figurines (see pp. 12-13), it ranges through orange-buff, light orange, orange, orange-brown, and ochre. On the basis of published descriptions, this fabric seems to correspond with that of figurines produced in workshops in Thebes and Tanagra.40 Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish this fabric from the relatively coarse Corinthian fabric 5 (see p. 12). 143 and 144 are respectively the torso and head of an Early Classical seated goddess type, which is completely preserved in MF-2 in the Corinth collection.41 The goddess, who wears a low polos and a peplos with a short overfold, sits with her hands on her knees. This votive type corresponds in general with the long series of Corinthian seated goddesses in Archaic and lingering Archaic style and their local Classical counterparts (see pp. 42-43). 145 is poorly preserved, but it can be clearly identified as a semidraped standing youth of a type well known in the Kabeirion at Thebes, wearing a mantle draped over the shoulders.42 The head 146 probably also belonged to a figurine of a youth, since the coiffure, with a roll of hair above the nape, is masculine. Although the fabric closely resembles that of other figurines in this group, the face, which somewhat resembles the Corinthian Classical C208, has larger, earthier features than more typically Boeotian faces, and the hair lacks the knot over the forehead characteristic of the Kabeirion youths (see p. 62). As votive types, the youths correspond to such Corinthian figurines as C188. The remaining five figurines belong to the 4th or 3rd century B.C. 151 probably represents Leda, although the left side of the figure, against which the swan should appear, is not well preserved. The figurine is similar in composition and proportions to the Corinthian H257, which could represent Aphrodite rather than Leda (see p. 174). There is also a possible Argive rendering of the same subject (116). 151 has been assigned here to a Boeotian workshop on the basis of fabric; published Boeotian representations of Leda are not the same in composition,43 although the existence of several versions quite different from one another suggests a particular interest in the subject and the possibility of still more types. 151 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, which terminates at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The fabric of the fragmentary draped female figurine 150 is close to that of 151. It includes a rather clumsy version of a motif found in some 4th-century B.C. Boeotian figurines, in which the right hand pulls the mantle overfold slightly to the side.44 147 is a variant of a type found at Tanagra, dating to the first half of the 4th century B.C. and thought to represent Demeter.45 Characteristic of this type is the mantle with an overfold, which was lifted in the right hand and draped over the head. 148 is a well-known "Tanagra" type.46 On stylistic grounds it should date to about the middle of the 3rd century B.C.; its pottery context, which terminates in the third quarter of 38 British Museum I, p. 203. 39 Publication forthcoming. 40 Higgins 1986, p. 65. 41 Shoe 1932, p. 59, fig. 3. 42 Kabirenheiligtum V, e.g., pp. 46, 156, no. 104, pl. 7. 43 E.g., British Museum I, pp. 230-232, nos. 863, 868, 869, pl. 123; p. 234, no. 877, pl. 127; p. 235, no. 880, pl. 128. 44 Cf.

The better-made 149 is unfortunately only a fragment of a standing draped female figurine, but its plaque base and the arrangement of folds with one pointed shoe drawing the hem to the side support its identification as another "Tanagra" type. 171, which may represent a seated nurse and could perhaps be of Boeotian fabric, is dis- cussed below with figurines of uncertain provenience. The draped female figurine 162, also discussed below, may possibly be of Boeotian fabric and technique. One of the protomes (156), discussed below with the Rhodian protomes, could perhaps be of Boeotian fabric as well, but too little of the head is preserved to identify the type precisely. In addition to the imported figurines, connections with Boeotian workshops during the Classical period can be found in the seated peplos-figurine C70 (see pp. 45-46), which is likely to have been copied from a Boeotian type like 143 and 144. There is also Boeotian influence on the knotted coiffures of the Corinthian figurines of youths C192, C203, and C204 (see p. 62) presumably through imports similar to 145. The Dionysos masks C271 and C272 (see p. 76) may have been mechanically copied from imported Boeotian masks. The protome C259 (see p. 74) could have been mechanically copied from an imported protome, although it is uncertain whether the source was Rhodian or Boeotian. For the Hellenistic period, the possible Boeotian contribution to Corinthian "Tanagras" has already been mentioned in the discussion of Attic imports (p. 291). The mantled figurine H117 could be mechanically related to certain Boeotian "Tanagras" (see p. 146); since the Corinthian piece seems too fresh to be a copy, and is very close in scale to the Boeotian examples, it may have been made in a collateral mold or stem from the same archetype. There seems to have been a certain amount of exchange of workshop materials between Corinthian and Boeotian workshops. The ephedrismos type H390-H394 (see p. 201) demonstrates a contribution from Corinth to Boeotia, and the same can be said of the standing boy type H319 (see p. 189). The Aphrodite H256 has a parallel from Tanagra of which it could be a copy, but there is a chance that it could itself be a Boeotian import (see p. 173). The seated youth H311 (see pp. 186-187) was almost certainly copied from a Boeotian type, although perhaps directly from an imported figurine rather than an imported mold. A final possible connection with a Boeotian workshop may be found in the ram V6 (see p. 267), which may have been copied from an imported figurine. RHODIAN FIGURINES (I52-I56) The five pieces attributed to Rhodes (152-156) are all fragments of protomes of 5th- century B.C. date.47 They have been attributed by type, since their coarse fabrics are not ab- solutely identical to one another in visual examination, but there seems to have been a certain degree of variation within Rhodian fabric that might explain this.48 The group, however, could also contain copies of Rhodian protomes made elsewhere (especially 156), which perhaps were made in Boeotia, where this type is known to have been copied.49 The type shows the right hand curved around the breast and a spray of curved folds radiating from the left hand. The long, serious face with a mobile mouth, characteristic of these Rhodian protomes, is known elsewhere in Corinth in a probable mold sibling of 52.50 Other evidence for 5th-century B.C. imports from Rhodes can be found in Corinthian copies of Rhodian head and torso types (C103 and C44). The protome C259 (see p. 74) may have been copied mechanically from an imported Rhodian (or perhaps Boeotian) protome. 47 For a complete example, see British Museum I, p. 89, no. 239, pl. 40. 48 British Museum I, p. 19. 49 British Museum I, pp. 223-224, no. 841, pl. 115. 50 C.

There is no evidence for connection during the Hellenistic period. WEST GREEK FIGURINES (157, 158) Two imported figurines can be identified as West Greek with some confidence. 157 was identified as Geloan by Nunzio Allegro. 158 should be Tarentine on the basis of both type and fabric. 157, a head from a small female bust wearing a polos decorated with rosettes, belongs to a popular Sicilian type.51 These busts represent Persephone and were dedicated to her in their homeland; 157, therefore, should be seen as a dedication to Kore in the Acrocorinth sanctuary. The inability to assign other Classical and Hellenistic imports to the same source suggests that 157 was a casual import by an individual rather than an item of organized trade. The Tarentine female figurine 158 also appears to stand alone, but here the case is more complex, since the influence of Tarentine banqueter types on Corinthian figurines (see p. 66) suggests that there were Tarentine imports not represented in the archaeological record. Seated semidraped female figurines from Tarentum similar to 158 sometimes hold masks, identifying them as Muses.52 In 158, however, neither hand is free to hold an attribute; the right hand originally was raised to the hair, and the left must have been propped on the seat. Unless a mask rested against the base, the figurine was not specifically a Muse, and in the context of the Acrocorinth sanctuary it could have represented a nymph, similar to the Corinthian H274, or perhaps Aphrodite.53 The slightly friable orange-buff fabric, with a creamy buff slip and small sparkling inclusions, is typically Tarentine. Two other seated figurines (169 and 170) are included below among the figurines of uncertain provenience, but the chair type of 170 points to a possible West Greek origin. With regard to demonstrable relations apart from the preserved imports, a Tarentine con- nection can be found in the backless construction of two Early Classical Corinthian figurines, the peplos-figurine C5 (see p. 26) and the banqueter C215 (see p. 66). This technical feature points perhaps to a local artisan who had worked in Tarentum, although local workshops could simply have copied the feature from imported figurines that have not survived. One of the Corinthian Classical seated types (C91 and C92 [see p. 45]) was known in Paestum; since it has a facial type paralleled in Tarentum, a Western source is likely, although the precise route is unclear. Typological influence from the West includes the introduction of the piglet carrier (see p. 26), a well-known type particularly in Sicily, although in the West the type seems to have represented Persephone rather than a votary, as in Corinth. The typical Corinthian Classical face, best exemplified in the hydriaphoroi, has West Greek parallels (see p. 40), although perhaps the influence in this case traveled from the Peloponnesos to the West. Fewer connections can be demonstrated for the Hellenistic period. A rather poor mantled fe- male figurine (H1 25 [see pp. 147-148]) may have copied a West Greek type. A few skirt fragments may indicate the presence of a Western dancer type (see p. 156). Finally, some Sicilian material could have been involved in the development of the Middle Hellenistic "priestess" type (see p. 253). IMPORTED FIGURINES OF UNCERTAIN PROVENIENCE (159-196) The figurines in this group, of various fabrics, appear to be of 4th-century B.C. or Hellenistic date. They are arranged by type, regardless of fabric, to show their connection with the local figurine groups and their place in the rituals of the sanctuary. Proveniences are suggested provisionally whenever possible. Fabric descriptions are provided in the catalogue. 51 E.g., Morgantina, p. 138, nos. 96a, 96b, pl. 23; British Museum I, p. 320, no. 1182, pl. 161. 52 In London, Higgins 1967, p. 126, pl. 60:D. 53 Cf., in San Francisco, Coroplast's Art, p. 157, no. 44, a Tarentine nude seated female figure wearing a low crown and identified as Aphrodite.</page><page sequence="317">DISCUSSION 295 Votaries The standing draped female figurines 159-161 probably represent young votaries corre- sponding to Corinthian types. The crudely made 159, with a large piglet held horizontally across the abdomen, is generally similar to the Corinthian H12. It is unclear whether the swollen abdomen visible in the profile view intentionally represented pregnancy or is the result of poor workmanship. 160, a quietly standing girl in a peplos with her arms at her sides, is mechanically related to a Corinthian mold series, but the fabric is sandier than typical Corinthian fabrics; this figurine may have been made in a marginal or neighboring workshop (see p. 283). 161 is degenerate in the disfigured facial features, which were neither repaired in the mold nor corrected on the figurine itself. The fold pattern of the peplos, as far as it can be discerned, and the coiffure that clings closely to the head suggest that this figurine could represent the last gasp of an Argive mold series, wherever it was actually made. Its pottery context is late 4th century B.C. Standing Draped Female Figurines 162-167 are draped figurines of widely varying types. 162 wears a mantle that originally was arranged in a heavy fall down the left side. Neither the fabric nor the method of venting by punching a small round hole in the back is typically Corinthian. The venting is similar to Boeotian practice,54 and indeed, the fabric might possibly be Boeotian, but in scale and style, this figurine is close to the Corinthian H88. 163 and 164 are similar to one another in their small size, thick-walled construction, and fabric; they were probably made in the same workshop. The pose of 163, with the left arm at the side, the right across the waist, recalls the larger Corinthian figurine H152; 163 could be a derivative of the Corinthian type, which has a more complex pose with torsion. 165 and 166 are probably mold siblings, which together reconstruct the type almost com- pletely. The type is known in a mid-3rd-century B.C. figurine from Tanagra, which holds a pomegranate in the extended right hand and is thought to represent Persephone.55 The two smaller figurines from the sanctuary are likely to be derivatives of this type. One of them (165) is of a sandy, marginal Corinthian fabric (see p. 283). This "Tanagra" type is not represented at the sanctuary among the preserved Corinthian figurines. Some of the standing draped female figurines discussed thus far could have been made in marginal or neighboring workshops (see pp. 283-284), but the last figurine in this group bears no resemblance to the Corinthian figurines from the sanctuary and must have been imported from a distance. 167 is characterized by heavy masses of drapery collapsing over the feet in broken folds. The style is not earlier than Middle Hellenistic; it calls to mind sculpture more than figurines and an origin in Asia Minor.56 The heavy collapse of folds suggests that a mantle is falling from the body and that the figurine might therefore represent either Aphrodite or Leda. Other possible connections with Asia Minor consist of the head of the Corinthian "priestess" type (see p. 253) and the bucranium 191 (see p. 298), which could perhaps be from Priene. Seated Draped Female Figurines All four seated female figurines are clearly non-Corinthian in both fabric and type. In 168, the foot overhangs the footstool considerably, and the hem drops at the left side, as if draped over part of the seat. The curved legs of the footstool terminate in hooves. Footstools often have animals' feet but more commonly terminate in lions' paws57 than hooves, which are more common in folding stools.58 Further, the footstool in 168 is a good deal higher than other examples; in height, 54 Cf., in London, Higgins 1986, pp. 68, 138-139, fig. 166:B. 55 In London, Higgins 1986, p. 136, fig. 163. 56 Cf., e.g., Pergamon, pp. 30, 207, no. 101, pl. 15; Top- perwein-Hoffmann 1971, p. 158, pl. 48:2, a seated figure with broken, collapsing drapery folds, from Magnesia on the Maeander, dated Late Hellenistic on the basis of style. 57 Richter 1966, pp. 50-51, type 2. 58 Richter 1966, pp. 43-45, type 1, e.g., fig. 247.</page><page sequence="318">296 CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC IMPORTED FIGURINES; EXTERNAL RELATIONS it resembles rather a folding stool, but it does not have the crossed, hinged legs. Perhaps the form of the stool has been confused by the coroplast; bronze mirror supports are known consisting of draped female figures standing on hooved folding stools,59 suggesting that 168 may be standing on a misunderstood folding stool, rather than seated. 169 and 170 are closely similar to one another in their rather coarse, orange-brown fabric and were probably imported from the same source. 170 is part of a seat and preserves only a few drapery folds of the figure on it. The seat, which has turned legs and a frieze of lions with curving tails, is paralleled by a chair in an Early Hellenistic Tarentine relief;60 chairs with turned legs and figured friezes below the seat rails are pictured in 4th-century B.C. Apulian vase painting as well,61 suggesting a South Italian origin for these two figurines. 169 would not have been seated on such a chair, since the left thigh slopes, and the right leg was a little higher; the figure must have been perched, half-sitting, half-leaning, on an irregular support, such as a rock. The figurine may have represented a nymph, her mantle draped around her legs, generally similar to such Corinthian nymphs as H274. 169 and 170 are from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. 171 is a very dull impression, but the knees and lower legs of a draped figure can be discerned, possibly with a child perched on the lap. This figurine could be an old nurse holding a child, a well-known Attic and Boeotian type;62 the rather coarse brownish fabric of 171 could perhaps be Boeotian. Dancers 172 appears to be a degenerate version of the Late Classical Corinthian dancer C282. Since the fabric looks Corinthian apart from the abundant voids, which indicate a use of organic temper that is not normal for Corinthian workshops, 172 may have been made in a marginal or neighboring workshop (see p. 283). The mantled dancer 173 is of the same general type as the Corinthian dancer H153, but since the head is bent strongly towards the right shoulder, the composition probably was closer to that of the fragmentary H170. It is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Isolated Female Heads 174 is a head of a distinctly Corinthian type, but the coarse fabric should place it in a marginal or neighboring workshop (see p. 283). The rounded coiffure tied with a sphendone is typical of Corinthian articulated "dolls" (cf. C125), and the clustering of the features near the center of the face is also a local trait, as in the head C153. A similar source may be supposed for 175, which appears to be a degenerate form of a Corinthian head type similar to H242. In the original type, the sakkos covered all the hair; in 175, however, the band bordering the forehead has been retouched as hair, so that the sakkos looks like a hat perched on the head. The much more elegant and better-made 176 is foreign in both type and material. It is known in the Demeter sanctuary in two generations (see catalogue), which might suggest more or less regular trade with its place of origin, but the distinctive orange fabric does not appear in any other figurines. A closely similar type with upswept curls is known at Delos,63 but it is unclear whether it was actually made there, since many figurines were imported to the island, as were clays, in the absence of suitable local material.64 177 probably is mechanically related to H246, a head in Corinthian fabric apparently copying an Argive type, although the workmanship is so different that one cannot easily associate the two 59 Richter 1966, figs. 252, 253. 60 J.

In 177, the coroplast added accessories unusual in Corinth, a very small stephane and large earrings that project at an angle. The fabric is very fine, like Corinthian in texture, but it has been fired hard and is gray in color; if it is Corinthian clay, a further departure from the normal practice is the application of a thick slip, which has fired to the common Corinthian colors of greenish buff and orange-buff. 177 could be the product of a good neighboring workshop. 178 seems to imitate a Boeotian head type used for figurines of Leda,65 with two lumps of clay added in place of the lampadion knot of the original; the fabric is not Boeotian, however, but resembles Corinthian fabric 1 (see p. 11). 179 is also of a fabric resembling Corinthian, but the firm, geometrically organized retouch of the hair is not a local trait. This style of retouch is rather like that on a head of a figurine in Berlin of reported Megarian provenience.66 Both heads could be from neighboring workshops. Figurines of Deities Among the figurines of uncertain provenience, there are several likely representations of deities, apart from 169, which could represent a nymph. Only the lower half of 180 is preserved, but the skirt clings so closely to the slim, elegant, and nude-seeming legs as to suggest a representation of Aphrodite. Both fabric and type, as far as preserved, are non-Corinthian. 181 is a mirror image of a Boeotian Leda type,67 but the style and workmanship (except for the shape of the vent) are rather closer to the Aphrodite 114, which has been assigned to Argos. The fabric of 181, however, is finer than the Boeotian and Argive fabrics available for comparison. 181 is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The only other figurine of uncertain provenience that could represent a deity is the fine nude male 182, which has a parallel in sculpture. As far as the pose is preserved, the sharply raised right upper arm, extended left forearm, and outthrust right hip recall the Apollo Lykeios, an Athenian sculpture thought to be connected with the reorganization of the Athenian ephebeia in the 330s B.c.68 In the context of the Demeter sanctuary, a representation of Apollo is unexpected, since this deity otherwise appears only in miniature relief among the deities on the polos V14. Perhaps the ephebic connection in Athens drew the type into the orbit of coming-of-age, which appears to have been part of the function of the Acrocorinth sanctuary. The rendering in small- scale terracotta of well-known statues was a specialty of workshops in Asia Minor, particularly Myrina and Smyrna.69 The latter center especially produced copies of male sculptural types, but the fabric of 182 is not the distinctive Smyrnaean fabric, and, in any case, the coroplastic output of Smyrna is dated mainly to the 1st century B.C. and 1st century A.C., through most of which period the Demeter sanctuary was not open.70 Under the circumstances, it is probably best to identify this figurine not as Apollo but as Dionysos, who is otherwise known at the Acrocorinth sanctuary (see p. 76). A similar composition was used to represent Dionysos in Hellenistic terracottas, although apart from the pose, 182 does not resemble any of the extant figurines.71 The pottery context of 182 unfortunately does not help to date it, but the figurine shows the surface blisters that result from the use of a plaster mold. The use of this technique should date 182 not earlier than the 3rd century B.C. (see p. 16). 65 British Museum I, p. 235, no. 880, pl. 128. 66 Kdnigliche Museen, pp. 16-17, pl.

Male Figurines As is the case among the Corinthian figurines, the male figurines of uncertain provenience are relatively few. The three preserved torsos are small in scale and are from standing mantled figures. 184 is a compact figure of slender proportions on a high, cylindrical base. The provenience of similarly constructed figurines in Berlin is reported to be Megara.73 185 is slightly fleshy and, like the Corinthian H302, could perhaps represent a boy. 186 is made of a sandy fabric similar to that of 160 and 165 and may be from a marginal Corinthian workshop. Children Two of the three figurines of children may be grotesques. The mantled boy 187 is distinctly dolichocephalic and perhaps represents a pathological condition. It is of a general type known also in Hellenistic small bronzes,74 and in subject it approximates the Corinthian H383. The fabric of 187 is close to that of the nude male figure 182, and it also has surface blisters indicating the use of a plaster mold. The two figurines are probably from the same non-Corinthian source. 188 is also mantled and has an overly large head; the wide, flat nose gives the face a somewhat negroid cast, but the coiffure is like that of other figurines of children (e.g., H326) and is not the very short, curly hair of African heads. 189 is a very dull impression of a child's head in a stephane. Although the fabric is rather similar in appearance to Attic, the blunt modeling and absence of retouched detail are not typical of Attic workmanship. Varia The animals of uncertain provenience (190-I93) consist of one pig and three bovines, a different proportion from the Corinthian figurines, among which pigs predominate. The bucranium 191 could perhaps be attributed to Priene, although no comparative material is available for identification of the fabric. No comparable bucrania have been excavated in Priene, but the tiny female head over the forehead between the horns has an exaggerated bowknot coiffure, and with its puffy cheeks and triangular forehead resembles the heads of Baubo figurines from Priene.75 One of the cow's heads, 193, is from the construction fill of the Trapezoidal Building, the terminal date of which is the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. The remaining imports consist of a hand offering what may be a buttoned purse (194), presumably belonging to a figurine of a votary and comparable to the Corinthian hands with offerings V20-V24; a support for a standing figurine in the form of an archaizing female figure (195), the fabric of which could perhaps be Argive; and another support (for a figurine of Aphrodite?) at the base of which a winged figure, probably Eros, sits (196). The remains of a fairly large rectangular vent at the back of 195 point to a date within the Classical period. The Corinthian support V43 also takes the form of an archaizing female figure but wears a different costume. 72 On dancing Attis types, see LIMC III, 1986, pp. 33-35, nos. 240-278, pls. 29-32, s.v.

The absence of such an overall study has somewhat handicapped the following discussion of the small number of Roman figurines from the sanctuary. Further, the sanctuary finds do not include material from the first 50-75 years of the Roman colony's existence, making possible links with pre-Roman Corinth hard to forge. Consequently, any conclusions reached here should be considered provisional. Although some people continued to live at Corinth between its destruction by the Romans in 146 and its refounding as a Roman colony in 44 B.c.,2 there is no clear evidence for activity at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore until the first or second quarter of the 1st century A.c.3 Thus, unless the cult was pursued elsewhere in Corinth or in the neighborhood by the survivors of the disaster and, later, the earliest colonists, there was a break in its continuity lasting at least a century and a half. The rebuilding of the sanctuary after such a long interval, however, shows that in some way the cult was remembered. Perhaps it was helpful that the buildings apparently remained visible, since the sanctuary was never actually destroyed but only abandoned. The Roman colonists showed a tendency to revive some of the abandoned Greek sanctuaries of Corinth but not necessarily to recreate the original rituals.4 New realities and the influx of new people must have stimulated changes in the way the functions of the Demeter sanctuary were perceived, but the figurines of Roman times do show some iconographic similarity with those of the earlier periods. Although the interval of cult inactivity was long, perhaps recollection of what was done in the old days, handed down by descendants of the surviving Corinthian population, inspired a renewal of offerings of figurines paralleling the older types. Alternatively, the renewed patterns of worship could have been inspired by uninterrupted cultic practices followed elsewhere in honor of the goddesses. It is certainly hard to imagine a complete lacuna of at least a century and a half, with no attention paid in Corinth to these important fertility and chthonic deities. In whatever way votive practice was renewed, it is at once apparent that the quantity of figurines dedicated at the sanctuary is much smaller than in the preceding periods, both in absolute numbers and relative to the quantity of other finds. The catalogue of 29 Roman figurines contains all the material found for the approximately three-century duration of the Roman sanctuary. This small number is not merely a sampling, as in the case of the much more abundant earlier figurines, but the total harvest, apart from a few lumps of apparently Roman fabric but unidentifiable shape. Further, among this number are several pieces that may, in fact, be Hellenistic (see below). Given that more than 24,000 figurines or fragments were found at the sanctuary, the number assignable to the Roman period is minuscule, and one must infer that the dedication of figurines did not play an important role in the conduct of the cult. The largest group published so far is in Corinth XII, pp. 55-62, pls. 34-43. 2 On habitation during the interim period, see p. 249. 3 Corinth XVIII, ii, pp. 4-5; Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 434. 4 C. K. Williams 1987, esp. pp. 31-32.</page><page sequence="333">312 ROMAN FIGURINES While it is hard to draw conclusions from such a small statistical base, a degree of continuity can be found in the overall pattern of types dedicated. The Roman figurines, excluding drapery and limb fragments belonging to unknown types, include two or possibly three representations of Aphrodite; three of Artemis; possibly one of Nike; possibly one of Athena; six draped females; one nude male; one draped boy; four or possibly five children; three grotesques; and one representation of Pan. Unless some of the fragmentary draped females represent Demeter or Kore, or R12, which may represent Matrona, refers to Demeter, the goddesses do not appear among the figurines. Aphrodite makes a good showing, as she did earlier (see pp. 169-177), but Artemis is more prominent than before (see p. 183), perhaps absorbing some of the function relating to coming-of-age, for which she was responsible elsewhere. Nike was known in the Hellenistic sanctuary, although only marginally (see pp. 183-184). The only male deity is Pan, who also was known earlier (see p. 200). As before, there are more female than male figurines, and a number of figurines of children and grotesques. A rooster figurine included with Varia (V12) could perhaps be of Roman date (see p. 269). There is more cultic than technical continuity with earlier figurines, presumably because the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C. caused the closure of its coroplastic workshops (see p. 249). One could not expect technical expertise to be handed down with the same persistence as religious tradition, particularly in the absence of opportunities to practice it. Among the Roman figurines from the sanctuary, two groups are recognizable by their fabrics. For one, the coroplasts appear to have employed the well-known fine, pale Corinthian clay (see p. 10). The Roman figurines in this fabric, however, usually are slightly coarse, owing to the presence of small dark inclusions, which are only occasionally found in the earlier figurines. Most of the figurines in this fabric are relatively small, in size range 2 or 2-3. They are usually fired harder than before. On the basis of style, they probably belong to the 2nd century A.C. The figurines in this fabric include two Aphrodites (R13 and R14); two figurines of Artemis (R15 and R16); two children (R17 and R18); one base (R19); and a mantled boy (R20). The second fabric is unlike any used previously for figurines in Corinth, and there is some question of its origin. It is a coarse reddish brown, with a moderate amount of inclusions and voids. The inclusions are sometimes gray, red, and white, resembling the material typically added to the pre-Roman Corinthian "tile fabric" (see p. 10). When the figurine is thin-walled, as in R8 and R9, the fabric to some degree resembles that of Corinthian cooking pots. It is possible that the Roman figurines in this fabric were made in Corinth. Presumably because of the coarseness of the fabric, the scale of these figurines, which are usually in size range 3-4, is somewhat larger than that of the group in the paler, finer fabric. They are also much more closely linked to Hellenistic style, so much so that if one could prove that this fabric was in use before the destruction of Corinth, there would be little difficulty in assigning them to the Hellenistic period. Nevertheless, since one figurine of coarse fabric, the child's head R7, was found in a pottery context that was 97 percent Roman, dating to the late 1st to possibly the mid-2nd century A.c.,5 and since the influence of Hellenistic forms might still be expected at this time, figurines in the coarse fabric are here tentatively assigned to the Roman period. The coarse figurines must be earlier than the fine on stylistic grounds; since the rebuilding of the sanctuary in the first or second quarter of the 1st century A.C. gives a terminus post quem, a date in the second half of the 1st century A.C. is suggested here for the figurines, taking into account the date of the associated pottery. It is not yet clear exactly how soon after the founding of the Roman colony of Corinth in 44 B.C. its coroplastic industry revived, but these figurines are unlikely to represent the very first efforts. The figurines in this fabric include a possible Aphrodite (R1); a possible Nike (R2); a nude male (R6); a child's head (R7); and four draped females (R8-R11). 5 Lot 73-143; see Corinth XVIII, ii, p. 142.</page><page sequence="334">DISCUSSION 313 The remaining Roman figurines are distinct in fabric from both groups of figurines discussed above. In a few examples, although the fabric as a whole looks quite similar to the coarse fabric described above, the inclusions are pebbly and do not resemble anything used before in Corinth. The fragmentary head R12 has pebbly inclusions and probably represents Matrona, a type created in Athens in the early 3rd century A.c.;6 it could be an import. The long plaits are typical of these heads, as is a high crown, the lower part of which is preserved here. If this head is an import, the grotesque heads R3-R5, which also have pebbly inclusions, could be Athenian as well, although there are no published parallels. In any case, pending a more comprehensive study of the Roman figurines in Corinth as a whole, the possibility that at least some of the figurines of coarse fabric are imports should be kept in mind.7 For the sake of convenience, the Roman figurines will be discussed by fabric rather than in typological order, as in the case of the earlier figurines. The figurines of coarse fabric, which are earlier, will be considered first. R1 is a rather blocklike female torso fragment, with little anatomical detail. Enough of the right shoulder is preserved to show that the arm originally was raised, suggesting a pose in which one hand, at least, arranged the hair. If this reconstruction is correct, the type recalls popular Hellenistic renderings in various media of Aphrodite or a woman arranging her hair.8 The bent right leg of R2 seems to be dangling rather than standing, and the drapery behind her, originally perhaps spread out to the right, is windblown. Perhaps she originally represented a flying Nike.9 For such a coarse fabric, the drapery shows a fair amount of skillful detail. The fabric of these two figurines is closely similar, with gray and brown inclusions. The following three figurines, all grotesque heads, have gray and white pebbly inclusions. R3 is a type of head with a deliberately misshapen face and slit mouth, known in the Demeter sanctuary also in Hellenistic fabric (see H384). The very wide nose and thick lips of R4 are a caricature of an African's features; the lower part of the face of R5 is not preserved, but the short, curly hair could indicate that the subject is similar. African children and young men were very popular subjects for Hellenistic small bronzes and terracotta figurines,0l and a few such figurines are published from elsewhere in Corinth.1l Whether or not the heads from the sanctuary are imports, the ultimate source of inspiration for these types is thought to be Alexandria.12 The nude male upper torso R6 is a rather puzzling piece in that it apparently has a finished margin all around the shoulders, chest, and waist. Only the head appears to have been broken off; it was never intended to have arms or a lower torso. One thinks of an archetype, but in that case a head would not have been added, and the figure seems to have broken away from a background of some sort. Perhaps the intention was to make a bust, but the lower margins were never properly finished. In fact, busts on bronze roundels used to decorate chests and the fulcra of couches are of similar shape and size, and it seems likely that the mold of R6 was taken from such a bust.13 The fabric of this figurine shows red, white, and gray inclusions similar to those of earlier Corinthian fabrics (see p. 10). The same inclusions appear in the head R7, which is from a pottery context dated late 1st to possibly mid-2nd century A.C. The upper part of the face is not preserved, but the round shape, plump cheeks, and short nose suggest a child's head. 6 Agora VI, pp. 9-11, cf. esp. pl. 5. 7 On Roman coroplastic imports in Corinth, see Cor- inth XII, p. 21. 8 E.g., LIMC II, 1984, pp. 55-56, nos. 424-454, pls. 40-43, s.v.

R8 shows a full-breasted figure wearing a peplos over a chiton. The double garment and the thick, deep V-shaped fold of the neckline recall Hellenistic drapery as, for example, in the "priestess" H395. If R9 belongs to the same figurine, a mantle was draped around the hips and knotted at the left side. One thinks of the knots on Isiac costume, but they are usually at the breast. R10 is merely an arm at statuette scale, but its short sleeve indicates that this figurine also could have been wearing a similar costume. R11 is another arm of a statuette, but extended forward and draped in a mantle. The figurines of fine fabric, almost certainly of local origin, are somewhat more coherent in terms of typology and style. Although not enough material has been recovered to identify workshops, the qualitative difference between the barely articulated Artemis R16 and the nicely modeled, carefully retouched children R17 and R18 indicates either that more than one workshop was active or that figurines in this fabric and small scale were made over a span of time. There is also some difference in the degree of fineness of the fabric, R15 being slightly finer than the others, R14 a little coarser. The backs of these figurines usually were molded, and the mold join sometimes is visible when it was not trimmed smoothly. In the Corinthian Hellenistic workshops, when backs were molded, the joining techniques were usually much better. R14 shows surface blisters, indicating the use of a plaster mold. In Athens also, plaster was used as an alternative material for molds during the Roman period. 14 As in the case of the Corinthian Middle Hellenistic figurines, surface polishing may have removed the blisters from some plaster-molded figurines (see pp. 16-17), but terracotta molds certainly continued to be employed in Roman times.15 Two different but related Aphrodite types were produced. R13 is a fragment of a type with the left arm raised to the hair, while the right hand grasps the mantle around the thighs. Better-preserved examples have been found in Corinth: the possible mold sibling MF-1981-1 (P1. 77) and an example from the excavations East of the Theater, in a context of the second half of the 2nd century A.C.16 In another fragment (R14), the drapery appears to have been held in place only by a knot over the pubes, and both missing arms probably were raised to the hair. This "Anadyomene" pose of the arms is found in other Roman Aphrodite figurines from Corinth but in variant types, completely nude and with dolphin or herm supports.17 Both types, with one hand to the hair or both, are known in renderings in other media.18 The Corinthian coroplasts were therefore drawing ideas from the common artistic pool of the period. Among the figurines of fine fabric are also two different Artemis types, both fragmentary. The original form of R15 can be restored through a complete example in Corinth (MF-1156 [P1. 77]). The fragment preserves a torch blazing just beside her hair at the left side, as in the Middle Hellenistic "priestess" H395; the top of her quiver is visible above the right shoulder. From the complete example one can add a knee-length chiton with an overfold to the hips, a patera in the lowered right hand, and a dog standing at the right. Despite the long artistic gap of the interim period, the typically Corinthian long, straight-sided, full-jawed, large-featured facial type reappears once again. A similar type from the excavations East of the Theater is from a context dated to the second half of the 2nd century A.c.19 A similar type also was known at Myrina.20 R16 preserves the lower part of the second Artemis type, showing a dog seated at her right and a high, rectangular base molded at the top and bottom.

The two children (R17 and R18) are the best-made figurines among those of fine fabric. They are probably mold siblings; from the two, the type from the thighs downward can be reconstructed. The chubby legs seem to belong to a child of less than five years, probably a boy, since little girls usually were not represented nude. The child leans on a low pillar support, and the whole is raised on a typically Roman high, rectangular base, molded at the top and bottom. The base R19 is included here, in spite of the loss of the figurine it supported, for the sake of the possible relief decoration on the front panel and the animal feet. The following three figurines are discussed here by virtue of their hard-fired, pale fabric, although differences in subject or scale separate them from the other figurines of fine fabric. R20 represents a child older than R17 and R18. The figurine is of a type known in small bronzes and sometimes called the "child orator"; this name arises from the combination of a boy's narrow-shouldered, plump-bellied anatomy, with a pose and mantle arrangement best known in portraits of the great intellectual figures of the Greeks. A good example is a fine Late Hellenistic or Roman bronze in Boston, thought to represent a schoolboy presenting an exercise in rhetoric;21 although the pose of the arms is reversed, the bronze shows attenuated proportions like those of R20. Another figurine of this type but of different fabric (MF-10767) is from a tomb in Corinth.22 Two heads (the helmeted R21 and the Pan R22) are larger in scale. Only the upper part of the helmeted head R21 is preserved, and the coiffure is so poorly detailed that it is uncertain whether the head is male or female. The Athenian helmet would be appropriate for a representation of Athena or Roma,23 but the subject also could be a warrior. The head of Pan (R22), like the Aphrodite R14, retains the surface blisters left by a plaster mold. The facial features of the Pan are well articulated and detailed, suggesting that the mold was taken from something like the handle mask of a bronze vessel24 or perhaps an ivory relief.25 The remaining figurines are different from the above two groupings of figurines made of coarse and fine fabrics and also are different from one another in their individual combinations of subject, fabric, and scale. R23 is from a pottery context terminating in the Early Roman period; if it is properly placed after the interim period, it should belong to the 1st century A.C. In spite of the flat chest, it is likely to represent a woman, since both the androgynous shape of the body and the long, drooping folds are paralleled in Early Roman portrait statues of women.26 R24 is, unfortunately, only a fragment of a head of large scale and probably good quality. In spite of the sensuousness of the mouth, the round jaw, small chin, and almost pursed lips suggest that the head is that of a small child. Of similar statuette scale is the hand R25; the short, plump fingers look like those of a child. Something has broken from the palm, either an object held in the hand or the top of the support on which the hand rested. The former is probably the case, since a bracelet was incised only on the inner side of the wrist, suggesting that it was visible and hence held upward. The two fragmentary mantled female figurines (R26 and R27) are assigned to the Roman period with some hesitation. They are of a fabric resembling the earlier fabric 1 (see p. 11), and the subject, in which one arm pulls down on the mantle as if in a sling, is certainly at home in the Hellenistic period. Nevertheless, when viewed beside the Corinthian Hellenistic figurines with similar mantle arrangements (H100-H105 [see pp. 143-144]), certain differences become 21 Master Bronzes, p. 136, no. 137; see also Comstock and Vermeule 1971, p. 77, no. 80; Walters Art Gallery, p. 74, no. 158, pl. 34. 22 Grave 1962-23; the lower chronological limit is the 1st century A.C., but the figurine is from disturbed fill. 23 For Roma, e.g., Gods Delight, pp. 333-336, no. 64. A similar, better-preserved head, MF-71-219, was found in the Gymnasium excavations, in a context dated 4th century A.C. but with earlier material: Michaud 1970, pp. 953, 955, fig. 139. 24 Cf. Tassinari 1993, I, e.g., pl. CVII:4, 6. 25 E.g., D. B. Thompson 1959, no. 43 (2nd century A.C.). 26 E.g., Horn 1931, pp. 75, 81, pl. 41:3.</page><page sequence="337">316 ROMAN FIGURINES apparent. The Hellenistic figurines are draped with the mantle close around the neck, while in R26 and R27 the sling arm pulls the top of the mantle down to reveal the V-shaped folds of the chiton neckline. In addition, the folds are rather thick and fit awkwardly over the contours of the figure, unlike the more organically coherent Hellenistic renderings. R28 is another fragment that could be misplaced in this chapter. It represents a standing female figure, her hand propped on a short support at the left side, with a mantle draped around her hips. Unfortunately, the fabric cannot be identified owing to the use of preservative to protect the colored paints. The rendering is crude and could be late, but the coroplast used a very bright blue paint known in Hellenistic figurines (see p. 14). Unless the technique of using this paint was revived in Roman times, this figurine could be Hellenistic. The final figurine fragment is an Artemis (R29), which is similar to R15 in its complete form (PI. 77) in the torch at the left side, the high boots, and the long overfold, but it is larger in scale, coarser in fabric, and more static in drapery style.

Since the organization of this study by iconographic types has resulted in the physical separation of these interpretive attempts, they are here gathered together in an overall synthesis, to determine how the figurines illuminate the rituals and underlying ideas of the cult. Page references in parentheses refer to more detailed discussions in the above chapters, although for complete information the reader should refer to the general index. Keeping in mind that the figurines cannot explicate all aspects of the cult, since they did not necessarily play a role in all rituals, in this chapter I will try to determine, on the basis of the coroplastic and associated evidence, when in the course of the year and for what purposes figurines were offered at the sanctuary. The definitive statement regarding the nature of the cult as a whole must await the final volume of the sanctuary excavation report,l which will gather together all of the evidence: the rather slim literary and epigraphic data, the architecture, the use of space, the different categories of images and votive gifts, and the analyses of organic materials. Since the conclusions reached in this summary are based mainly upon the figurines, although supported when possible by other evidence, they are subject to revision when the sanctuary with its rich finds is studied as an entity. Nevertheless, given that the very large quantity of figurines found in the sanctuary demonstrates the importance of this class of votives in its rituals, that the offering of votives was a central ritual act for worshipers at Greek sanctuaries,2 and that figurines were important carriers of spiritual expression, their evidence inevitably will play a significant role in the final interpretation. It is more difficult to derive evidence for the cult from the Archaic figurines, since there are fewer types and these tend to be generic, but whenever they are useful, Archaic types are included in this discussion.3 It is important to emphasize at the start that ancient written evidence for the function and significance of figurines is very scarce. Hence all discussions like the present one must depend upon inferences drawn from the figurines themselves, supplemented by comparative evidence. The discussion will begin with a definition of the functions of figurines in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East and then will move on to methodological questions regarding interpretation and the use of supporting evidence; a consideration of figurine types; and an evaluation of the information the figurines provide about the nature and conduct of the cult. FUNCTIONS OF FIGURINES It may help to consider first the functions terracotta figurines historically served and the limitations of their evidence. Prehistoric figurine types consist mainly of animals and human females, often with more or less exaggerated sexual characteristics and occasionally shown in the act of giving birth. There are relatively few clearly male figurines; some are without defineable gender. These early figurines are sometimes found in concentrations and circumstances that can 1 Forthcoming in a later fascicle of Corinth XVIII, by Ronald S. Stroud and Nancy Bookidis. 2 Burkert 1985, pp. 68-70, 92-94. 3 Publication of the Archaic figurines is forthcoming.</page><page sequence="342">322 SUMMARIES be identified as cultic, but scattered finds in settlements could have had other uses (e.g., as toys),4 although perhaps still with underlying spiritual and cultural import. When traceable at a single site for a long period of time, the pace of development and change appears to have been very slow and the pull of tradition very strong.5 For subsequent periods, the possibility remains of some everyday use, but the bulk of excavated material comes from graves or the often large votive deposits of sanctuaries; intact figurines in museum collections are likely to have been robbed from graves. When found in homes, figurines and other small sculptures are thought to have had a votive as well as a decorative purpose.6 Although the repertoire of types increased greatly, particularly in the 4th century B.C. and later, the traditional repertoire remained strong, with types persisting virtually unchanged, sometimes for more than a century after they were stylistically outdated or with old-fashioned elements clinging to new creations. Although the vast amount of material dating to the periods following the Bronze Age and the incomplete record of publication have so far precluded definitive statistical analysis, the general assumption is probably correct that figurine types remained predominantly female throughout the history of production. The assemblages of some cult places, however, such as those of the Kabeirion at Thebes7 and to a lesser extent the Asklepieion at Corinth,8 have produced mainly male types. On the basis of its gender, pose, costume, and attributes, a figurine often can be associated with the worship of a particular deity or at least with a type of deity serving a particular function. Whatever the name of the deity, that function often is connected in one way or another with fertility, as illustrated by the cycle of birth, reproduction, and death. The view that terracotta figurines found in sanctuaries were merely cheap substitutes available to everyone in place of more valuable offerings,9 such as live sacrificial animals or statues, is probably an oversimplification. Animal figurines certainly could be interpreted in this way, given the costs of animal sacrifice;10 that they were indeed dedicated as substitutes has been proven by inscriptions on Mesopotamian dog figurines of the Bronze Age."l Small terracottas, however, were made long before large-scale dedications at sanctuaries became status symbols. In the historical periods, we do not know that the rich who paid for large-scale dedications did not also offer figurines. Further, some terracotta figurines are large, elaborately designed, highly detailed, painted, and even gilded creations that could not have been cheap. Others, such as articulated "dolls," have no known monumental or precious counterparts. The point is that figurines, which were probably the oldest continuously produced art form in the ancient world, were from their first use in cult meaningful images in their own right and not merely small substitutes for other images. In spite of a general similarity of purpose, patterns of dedication of figurines were not uniform over the entire Greek world but show considerable variation from place to place in the quantity of figurines offered and, when the recipient deity is known, in the specific figurine types deemed appropriate. Therefore, parallels from other sites may provide clues for interpretation but do not necessarily determine definitively what that interpretation should be. In the present study, we are fortunate to have an assemblage from a sanctuary whose principal resident deities are 4 For the current state of study of prehistoric figurines, see N.

INTERPRETATION OF THE FIGURINES 12 In light of recent work on the "reading" of images in ancient art as cultural signs,13 few would now accept the view that the iconography of votive figurines is arbitrary and carries no particular cultic significance, that figurines are essentially interchangeable in the gift-giving process.14 This view probably was encouraged by the often seemingly unrelated iconography of the rich variety of types, which seemed to point in no particular direction. When studied with attention, however, the images do fall into interrelated groups with apparently clearly directed meanings. Most semiological study so far has centered on Attic vase painting, because networks of images, that is, interacting figures in different combinations, are thought to give up their meanings more readily than isolated images.15 Figurines presumably count as isolated images, but when they are discovered in the course of archaeological excavation, an interpretive context is provided by where and how they were found and with what other artifacts. In place of the narrative that a vase painting supplies within its frame is the narrative that the dedicator of a figurine in effect devises when the gift is offered. The figurine is, in a sense, an extension of the worshiper and is deposited along with personal hopes, not only in a prescribed cultic act. The dedicator may construct the narrative according to a cultural formula or may have in mind a personal narrative composed from the needs of the self and close associates. Thus the offering of a figurine becomes a private as well as a public ritual.16 The private aspects of dedication remain unknown, except insofar as they intersect the public, but it is important to see dedicators as individuals interpreting the cult for themselves and not as prisoners of ritual.17 This personal element may in part explain the diversity of figurine types offered apparently for the same purpose. A given figurine type did not necessarily carry exactly the same symbolic force for everyone, and more than one type could express, with different emphases, the same idea. The interpretation of figurines in a cultic context falls into two parts, functional (i.e., expressive of a specific ritual act) and symbolic18 (i.e., expressive of underlying concepts inherent in the cult). The figurines represent only a portion of the symbolic content of the cult, however, which would include as well the conformation and use of the ritual space, the speech and actions of the participants, and the other categories of votive offerings. The symbols taken together form a code, which is recognized by the participants and passed on to the young. 12 The following works have been particularly useful and inspiring for this project: Firth 1973 on social symbols; Bryson 1991 on the relation of pictorial images to society; Turner 1967 and Turner 1969 on the use of symbols in ritual; Douglas 1975 on the cross-cultural analysis of symbols; Jung 1967 on symbolism as a projection of the human psyche; and Sperber 1975, Boyer 1993, and Boyer 1994, pp. 47-60, on cognition and religious symbolism. Boyer, building on Sperber's work, has argued that some aspects of religious learning are genetically rather than culturally determined; see now also Burkert 1996. Although a theoretical model applicable to material such as ours has not yet appeared in the literature, a biological underpinning could be germane to fertility cults because of their antiquity and fundamental concern with survival. On the interpretation of figurines in funerary contexts, see Graepler 1997, pp. 149-159. 13 E.g., Berard et al. 1989; Sourvinou-Inwood 1991. 14 Rouse 1902, pp. 391-393; Corinth XV, ii, pp. 7-9; Cor- inth XII, p. 17; against this idea, C.

It is also possible to define a symbol as only one kind of sign. For a clear explanation of the distinction among different kinds of signs (signals, icons, and symbols), see Hodder 1987, pp. 2-3; this usage is not followed here. The utility of symbols is succinctly described by Turner (1969, p. 25) as follows: "What is made sensorily percepti- ble, in the form of a symbol. .., is thereby made accessible to the purposive action of society, operating through its religious specialists."</page><page sequence="344">324 SUMMARIES The code is socially accepted but is subject to change over time; new meanings may be given to old symbols, new symbols may be introduced to express existing ideas, or new symbols may express entirely new ideas. To give an example of function and symbol in figurines, the presence of hydriaphoros types may be functional, representing a ritual procession of female water carriers (see p. 38). On the other hand, the type may be only symbolic, the hydria symbolizing the abundance of water needed for agricultural fertility/for the bridal bath/for the rituals surrounding death. The type also may be functional and symbolic simultaneously. The hydriaphoros is a good example of the multivocality of symbols, which can have more than one meaning even within a single ritual situation;19 in this case, the symbol functions simultaneously as a reminder of agriculture, marriage, and death. THE USE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE: MATERIAL EVIDENCE Of the supporting evidence available for the interpretation of the figurines, the strongest is from Corinth itself It consists of other finds from the Acrocorinth sanctuary; finds from other cultic sites in the city, such as hero shrines and the Asklepieion; and Corinthian vase paintings showing cultic scenes. Less strong are objects of reported Corinthian provenience in museum collections, especially bronze caryatid mirrors and the later folding mirrors with relief covers. I have made use of these, with caution, when they portray subjects related to the figurines. Winter's 1903 compendium of figurines housed in European collections or on the market at that time includes a substantial number of figurines of reported Corinthian provenience or attributed to Corinth. On the basis of comparisons with figurines later excavated at Corinth, most of the dispersed figurines do indeed appear to be Corinthian. For this reason, it may not be necessary to be completely skeptical of the reported Corinthian provenience of bronzes, particularly when there are links with figurines in subject and style. Caution is also in order for iconographic comparisons with non-Corinthian material, since there is no guarantee o that the meaning of a figure ine type remained constant from place to place.20 On the other hand, it would be perverse to deny, for example, that figurines of pigs from Corinth symbolize fertility, because there is no direct evidence for this interpretation stemming from Corinth itself, when the meaning seems to be pervasive elsewhere in the Greek world. THE USE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE: LITERARY EVIDENCE Regrettably, the iconography of the figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary must be studied, for the most part, without the enrichment of a large body of literature.2 All the written material cited in the chapters above is non-Corinthian in origin, and sometimes it is late in date as well. Although literary references to figurines are rare, there are nevertheless some useful intersections with literary sources.22 For example, Kallimachos' description of votaries in the Hymn to Demeter (see p. 30) helps to identify some of the figurines as such. The accounts of votives in the Anthologia Palatina (see pp. 125, 194) point to possible divine recipients for the objects held by some of the figurines. On the other hand, it is difficult to recognize specific myths of Demeter and Kore in the figurines, which have, in any case, little capacity for narrative presentation. For example, is it valid to connect the Corinthian figurines of votaries carrying piglets with the late aition that links the ritual of throwing piglets into a chasm at the Athenian Thesmophoria with the swallowing up of the swineherd Eubouleus and his animals (p. 265)? Probably not, because of the lateness of the source. 19 Turner 1969, pp. 41-42. 20 On the uses and pitfalls of cross-cultural comparison, see Golden 1992. 21 For the written sources relating to the worship of Demeter and Kore on Acrocorinth, see Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 1-8. 22 See the index of literary sources cited on p. 369.</page><page sequence="345">THE FIGURINES AND THE CULT 325 THE USE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE: ETHNOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE Although evidence of cult practice in modern times offers no proof of ancient rituals or the thought behind them, ethnography nevertheless is a rich source of analogous material, which enables the researcher to offer plausible if not provable explanations.23 At the disposal of the ethnographer are spatial data, indicating how objects actually were placed and manipulated, as well as the interpretations of their acts by the participants themselves. Such information can offer very useful insights. Also useful are the apparent survivals into modern times of pagan customs and symbols, transferred from the original context into the orbit of Christian ritual or popular superstition. In the absence of documentation of historical links, the value of such analogies can be denied, however, no matter how striking they may be.24 In the present study, references are given to analogous material when it may prove useful, for example, with regard to apotropaic symbols and gestures (p. 143), the preparation of special cakes for festivals (p. 273), or the use of figurines in rituals (p. 337, note 97). FIGURINE TYPES: CHOICE OF TYPES AND THE QUESTION OF CHANGE When Socrates visited a country shrine near Athens (Plato, Phaedrus 230b), he recognized that it was sacred to Acheloos and the nymphs by the nature of its figurines and statues. Figurine types, then, during this period, were expected to be characteristic in some way of the cults in which they were offered. Unlike votives with intrinsic value, which could have been offered at any shrine for the sake of the material, regardless of iconography, terracotta figurines have value mainly in the subjects they represent. Not all deities received terracottas as a matter of course, but in cults related to fertility, figurines were customary dedications. We know from archaeological evidence that a single type could be offered at shrines sacred to different recipients. For example, horse-riders were a common dedication at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia, where they are accompanied by bulls and model boats.25 Horses and bulls are closely associated with Poseidon in myth, and the reference of boats to the sea god is obvious. Horse-riders, however, also were frequently dedicated to heroes in Corinthian shrines, where they are part of a very different as- semblage, including banqueters, goddesses, and snake-and-helmet stelai (p. 60). The horse-rider figurines are identical in both cases, but their contexts determined their different meanings. The cult is defined, therefore, not by one type but by the assemblage of different types offered, which represents the collection of pertinent symbols. In shrines of Demeter in different places, the figurine assemblage varies but generally with overlapping types.26 For example, the figurines from the Thesmophorion in Eretria27 are predominantly female, like those of the Acrocorinth sanctuary, and include the familiar hydriaphoroi, protomes, seated females, and children; pro- portionately, however, there are many more children and young women than at Corinth. The Eretrian assemblage lacks a series like the Corinthian piglet carriers, but it has a group of female musicians, a type not found in the Acrocorinth sanctuary. The assemblage from the Thes- mophorion at Bitalemi,28 on the other hand, includes many piglet carriers, as well as protomes and seated goddesses, and also kourotrophoi, which are not an Acrocorinth type (pp. 70-71). The fundamental question must be, how did the Greeks decide which types to offer in a shrine? Were the design parameters set solely by the artisans? How much were the worshipers involved? Individuals could not easily commission the firing of a few figurines, owing to the process of repetitive molding and the large number needed to fill a kiln sufficiently to make the firing economically worthwhile, but they were the purchasers and presumably could reject a type 23 On the use of ethnography in the study of Neolithic figurines, see Talalay 1993, p. 40. 24 On the use of later analogies and the limitations of such information, see Hill 1994, pp. 87-89. 25 Mitten 1962 (1963, p. 309). 26 Cole 1994, pp. 203-204, with bibliography.

If we accept figurines as symbols, and allow that these symbols were culturally determined, by what mechanism were they created? Did the priestesses deliberate on what types were suitable and then commission them in quantity from the workshops?29 An otherwise empty area beside the central staircase in the Acrocorinth sanctuary is thought to have held booths for selling votives.30 The notion that the sanctuary may have profited from the sale of votives opens the possibility that its officials had some control over the wares. On-site purchase of at least some of the types is favored by the presence only at the Acrocorinth sanctuary of one of the most popular types dedicated there, the young female votary carrying a piglet; it has as yet been found nowhere else in Corinth. On the other hand, without input from the cult authority, the artisan, working within the confines of his skills and available workshop materials, and knowing what had been done before and what would and would not express the code, could have created a suitable type and tried to market it at the site during festivals, directly from his workshop, or at a shop in the marketplace. The close association of certain types with particular shrines in Corinth suggests that figurines tended to be sold at or near the site.31 Even a possible shop deposit in the South Stoa, with figurines of the 3rd century B.C.,32 is matched by the closely similar figurines of a nearby votive deposit.33 After the Archaic period, the pace of change of figurine types quickened; more specifically descriptive types were created, often with variants. A similar phenomenon has been noted among Geometric small bronzes, which show a development from generic, multipurpose types to others more specifically referring to the cult.34 New types need not necessarily show change or discontinuity in the cult, although they may, but they may also reflect some impetus for intensifying worship in one way or another. For example, by the second quarter of the 5th century B.C., new types were introduced to the sanctuary that were also offered elsewhere in Corinth in hero shrines. These types were the banqueters (see p. 65) and the lingering Archaic standing "korai," which probably represent Aphrodite or Kore (see p. 23). During the Archaic period, the handmade horse-rider figurine had been the typical dedication to heroes, both in their own shrines and at the Acrocorinth sanctuary (p. 60). The new types appeared at a time of rebuilding and expansion in the sanctuary;35 they did not replace but supplemented the horse-riders. The use of banqueters and "korai" elsewhere in Corinth as dedications for heroes suggests that in the early 5th century B.C. this aspect of ritual at the sanctuary may have been enhanced. For the banqueters, Tarentine types were the source (see p. 66); the molds for the "korai" appear to have been developed in connection with bronze mirror caryatids (see pp. 26-27). It is not clear why hero cult may have become more prominent at the sanctuary at this time, but if it is true, the local artisans responded to the need for figurines by adapting available materials with some connection to the new purpose, to create acceptable types.36 If it is accepted that changes in figurine types could reflect changes in cult practice, certain developments can be seen over time. The introduction of new rituals or the intensification of some activities did not necessarily last forever. For example, by the later 4th century B.C. there is almost no evidence for hero cult among the figurines. Similarly, there is coroplastic evidence for the initia- tion of youths (see p. 61) and bridal rituals (see pp. 337-338) beginning in the 5th century B.c., and for the initiation of younger boys in the 4th century B.C. (p. 188), but by the later 3rd century B.C. 29 This idea was suggested to me byJean M. Turfa. 30 Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 201. 31 Merker, forthcoming. 32 Davidson 1942, pp. 126-127. 33 Broneer 1942, pp. 145, 148, fig. 7. The relationship of cultic requirements to the production and distribution of figurines in Corinth is discussed in Merker, forthcoming. 34 Langdon 1990a. 35 Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 427-428. 36 For the role of the painter in a similar process in more recent times, see Bryson 1991, p. 70: "The painter assumes the society's codes of recognition, and performs his or her activity within their constraints, but the codes permit the elaboration of new combinations of the sign, further evolution in the discursive formation. The results of painting's signifying work, these are then recirculated into society as fresh and renewing currents of discourse."</page><page sequence="347">THE FIGURINES AND THE CULT 327 all this has disappeared. Since the local coroplastic industry was reinvigorated with new types, including some pieces of high quality, in the later 3rd century B.C. (see p. 249), workshop inactivity was not the reason for these changes. Either the conduct of some rituals changed so as to exclude the dedication of figurines or perhaps the ceremonies were discontinued at this location, in favor of other shrines. In any case, the major new Middle Hellenistic type does not represent a votary like those so popular in Classical and Early Hellenistic times, but either a priestess or the goddess Demeter herself or perhaps a combination of the two (pp. 254-255). There were three major periods of rebuilding and expansion of the sanctuary: the late 6th-early 5th century B.c.; the second half of the 5th century B.C.; and the late 4th-early 3rd century B.C.37 It is difficult to connect coroplastic changes directly with these building periods, since we do not know whether the new structures housed cultic activities that employed figurines; further, other explanations could account for coroplastic change. Nevertheless, new types appeared in the sanctuary by the second quarter of the 5th century B.C., which could have arisen from increased participation in rituals following the opening of new facilities. In addition to the banqueters and "korai" mentioned above, other lingering Archaic types were introduced, as well as the earliest in a long series of peplos-figurines (see p. 23). To some extent, the growth in the number of figurine dedications in the 4th century B.C. could have resulted from late-5th-century B.C. building activities, although this increase may be related to the wealth of the period (p. 115). Similarly, new figurine types introduced in the later 4th or early 3rd century B.C., such as the votaries carrying piglets (see pp. 117-124), could have been related to building at that time but also could have been stimulated by the closing of the Potters' Quarter workshops in the 320s B.C. and the consequently increased coroplastic activity elsewhere in Corinth. The Macedonian presence on Acrocorinth in this period might also have been a factor in the appearance of new Aphrodite types at the sanctuary in the Early Hellenistic period (p. 170).38 THE NATURE AND CONDUCT OF THE CULT, AS SEEN IN THE FIGURINES The principal difficulty in the use of figurines to illuminate cultic activities at the sanctuary is the very long period during which figurines were dedicated, from the late 7th to the mid- 2nd century B.C., with some slight revival of the custom in the Roman period. Since no single type survived the entire life of the sanctuary, we are dealing with a patchwork of types, all with a rather loose chronology (see pp. 5-7), and so it is difficult to gain a clear picture of cultic activities during any one period. Further, figurines speak to us only of rituals in which they were offered, leaving aside other activities in which they played no part. With that caveat, the discussion of this subject will first consider deities: how representations of deities can be recognized; which deities are represented in different periods, and their iconographic forms; and what roles they may have played in the cult. A discussion of the participants in the cult will follow: their gender and age, their possible reasons for visiting the sanctuary, which deities they honored, and any evidence for specific rituals and festivals. The Deities One of the most difficult tasks in studying this group of figurines is identifying the deities among them. To begin with, there is sometimes a blurring of identity between the deity and the worshiper, and it is not always clear whether an object carried is a votary's gift or a deity's attribute (p. 24). A few cases are more certain: the Classical hydriaphoroi who carry water must be worshipers (p. 24); the Classical enthroned female figures wearing the polos must be goddesses (p. 24), although this type is generic and can only be assigned a goddess' name by 37 Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 427-433. 38 For apparent changes in cult practice in the Forum area after the Macedonians came to Corinth, see C. K. Williams 1978, p. 12.</page><page sequence="348">328 SUMMARIES the context in which it is found, if at all. The wearer of a polos is probably a goddess, although not necessarily (p. 254, note 22), and not every goddess wears this headdress, but the combination of polos and dignified enthronement should be a sign of divinity. At the Acrocorinth sanctuary, this type presumably was intended to represent either Demeter or Kore, the flower or bird sometimes held favoring the latter; the flaring polos, shaped like a kalathos, could suggest either goddess, depending upon whether it is thought of as a symbolic container for grain (Demeter) or fruit and flowers (Kore, pp. 47, 125). A similar ambiguity can be found in another type wearing the polos, the standing "kore" (p. 23, note 1), which was created early in the 5th century B.C. in a lingering Archaic style and was among the most popular types dedicated at the sanctuary. Most members of this group hold attributes (fruit, flowers, birds) that would serve for either Kore or Aphrodite, but the rooster held by a few ought to signify Kore. Does this mean that all figurines of this group were intended to represent Kore or only those with roosters? Were the goddesses even intended to be distinguished from one another at all?39 Perhaps the very ambiguity of identifiers in most of the likely goddess figurines shows that the worshipers did not need or want them, that the generic symbols fixed the meaning sufficiently and the participants completed the cultic narrative with their own thoughts. In the absence of attributes, because the type lacks them or the figurine is fragmentary, it is necessary to fall back on pose and costume alone. These elements can be helpful if the type is found in a recognizable cultic or mythological scene in votive or document reliefs, in vase painting, or occasionally in monumental sculpture. Although most of this evidence is non-Corinthian, and can be ambiguous when different deities share iconography, it is used of necessity. Such evidence is quite helpful when one seeks representations of Demeter, even though her iconography sometimes overlaps that of Hera in drapery arrangement and pose. The deities recognizable among the figurines from the sanctuary are the following: Demeter, Kore, Aphrodite, the nymphs, Artemis, Nike, Athena(?), Cybele(?), Eros, and Dionysos anad his circle (Silenos, satyrs, Pan). Of these, the most important in terms of frequency of representation and occasional supporting evidence are Demeter, Kore, Aphrodite, the nymphs, Eros, and Dionysos. To give a few examples of similar pantheons, near and far, a partly overlapping array is found at the cave at Pitsa; primarily sacred to the nymphs, there is evidence also for Dionysos, Demeter and Kore, and Eileithiya (p. 178). In the West, a similar, though not identical, range of deities was represented at Morgantina: Persephone (but not Demeter), Hades(?), Artemis, the nymphs, Eros, Nike, Athena, and Herakles.40 An example of an eastern shrine is thefavissa at Kharayeb in Phoenicia, which is thought to have belonged to a fertility cult honoring both Egyptian and Greek deities (p. 190). The deposit includes figurines of Demeter (but not Kore), Dionysos, Aphrodite, and Eros, forming a smaller group than the Acrocorinth pantheon, but one that includes most of its itimportant deities. The assemblage from Kharayeb also resembles the Acrocorinthian in the dedication of figurines of children and grotesques. A literary source for an array of deities invoked together with Demeter and Kore may be found in Aristophanes' Thesmophoriazusae (lines 969-994), in which the chorus calls on Hera, Artemis, Hermes,41 Dionysos, Pan, and the nymphs, as well as Demeter and Kore. Clearly, dedications representing an assortment of deities are to be expected in a Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore,42 but not all were necessarily formally worshiped beside the nominal owners of the shrine. Dionysos and Aphrodite, perhaps, have the strongest claims to actual rituals there. 39 On the difficult identification of this type, see Zuntz 1971, p. 177. 40 Morgantina, pp. 81-94. 41 A bearded sculptured head from the sanctuary (SF-64-5, Stroud 1968, p. 326, pl. 97:c) is thought to be from a herm (personal communication, Nancy Bookidis). 42 Alroth 1987; for "visiting" deities in four shrines ofDeme- ter, see p. 17, table 6.</page><page sequence="349">THE FIGURINES AND THE CULT 329 Demeter The cult title Epoikidie mentioned by Hesychios for Demeter at Corinth has been linked by Stroud and Bookidis to her worship on the Middle Terrace in a small cult building (hence the diminutive form), as well as the taking of communal meals in the houselike setting of the dining rooms on the Lower Terrace.43 This interpretation need not contradict the one suggested by the figurines, of Demeter as the patroness of the household and its concerns (p. 70), since religious symbols are polysemous (p. 324). Perhaps the epithet, originally assigned to the goddess of agriculture as a description of the place in which she was worshiped locally, gradually took on another meaning associated with the household, as is implied by the name itself.44 The local custom of setting up shrines over destroyed houses45 suggests that a certain sanctity was attached to the household, which may have been extended to this cult. In any case, there are two functions relating to the household that are illustrated by the figurines, fertile marriage (pp. 127, 170) and the nurturing of children (p. 70). The figurine types involved are young female votaries carrying piglets and probably representing brides (pp. 117-124); a possible representation of Demeter in the unveiling pose usually associated with Hera as a bride (p. 36); kalathiskos dancers referring to weddings (pp. 58-59); and baby boys, the hoped-for result of marriage and a source of anxiety for parents (pp. 68-73). These functions would have been analogous to the successful planting and raising of crops and the husbandry of animals, which were sought with other types of dedications, including miniature hydriai, hydriaphoroi (pp. 38-42), and handmade quadrupeds,46 the last mentioned probably referring to the increase of herds.47 The narrative that the dedicator brought to the ritual, however, is likely to have been deeper than the seeking of Demeter's patronage for a successful (i.e., fertile) marriage and through the identification of the young human bride and her mother with Kore and Demeter, to have embodied aspects of the feminine social and psychological experience.48 There are no certain representations of Demeter among the figurines. The most likely candidates are standing peplophoroi and mantled figures with drapery arrangements and poses characteristic of Demeter on votive and document reliefs, including the above-mentioned type in the act of unveiling or perhaps leaning on a scepter and pouring a libation. The fine, large H85, if correctly identified as Demeter, probably also represented the goddess pouring a libation (pp. 139-140). A large but fragmentary seated peplophoros (C93) could have been Demeter by virtue of its size, pose, and costume, and because it was handmade and of high quality, as if a rather special piece of work (p. 46). Another way in which Demeter might possibly have been portrayed is as a seated, mourning figure (p. 157). The pig figurines (pp. 265-266) probably were dedicated to Demeter, although Dionysos also received pig sacrifice. Kore The difficulty of distinguishing one goddess from another has already been discussed (p. 43); the goddess most affected is Kore, whose attributes overlap both Demeter's and Aphrodite's. The lingering Archaic standing "korai" and the seated goddess wearing the polos (p. 23, note 1) could represent Kore.49 Another candidate is the seated goddess wearing a low crown decorated with rosettes; a complete example in the Corinth collection (MF-1, PI. 75) has a fruit, probably a pomegranate, on her lap (pp. 46-47). Even here, however, the same attributes could also speak for Aphrodite. The low crown is found on a fragmentary 5th-century B.C. kotyle from the 43 Corinnth XVIII, ii, pp. 2, 72, note 23, p. 411. 44 On the worship ofDemeter unconnected with agriculture in Sparta, see Parker 1988, p. 103: "The cycle of crops was, in a sense, a metaphor, through which the cult of Demeter dealt with other concerns and satisfied other needs." 45 C.

At Lokroi the personalities of Aphrodite and Kore can be distinguished from one another,51 but at Corinth the iconography of the two goddesses is inextricably combined, perhaps because the figurines do not provide the evidence of narrative representation available on the Lokroi votive plaques. There is at least one rendering at the sanctuary of a Kore type known in reliefs, wearing a closely fitting mantle wrapped under one arm (p. 139); this is probably the only certain representation of Kore. Heads with a combination of polos and corkscrew curls are likely to represent Kore, since the polos usually signifies divinity, and the curls may be known elsewhere as a bridal coiffure (p. 133). If the seated goddesses represent Kore, she would have been portrayed as Queen of the Underworld, and her chthonic, fearful aspect would have been emphasized. It is curious that there is no sign of Hades, who is enthroned beside her on the Lokroi plaques, unless C278, an enthroned bearded male wearing a pilos, represents him (pp. 79-80, 332). There are a few figurines of roosters, however, and rooster plaques (p. 269), showing that some people dedicated one of the typical attributes of the chthonic deities and therefore probably had the Underworld in mind.52 Otherwise, Kore would have functioned in a very different role, as the prototype of the girlish, unwilling bride. The protomes may have been dedicated to Kore, in light of their frequent use in her worship in the West, where they are believed to represent Persephone as a bride (p. 74). Evidence for a race run by youths in honor of Kore (p. 61) suggests that at least some of the Classical and Hellenistic figurines of youths could have been dedicated to her, either before or after the race. Cult Statues(?) Unfortunately, there is no type that can reasonably be considered a copy of a cult statue of either Demeter or Kore. We are not even certain exactly where such an image might have been housed in the Greek sanctuary.53 For Roman times, the head of a probable cult statue has been recovered,54 but we do not have the benefit of information from Pausanias, since he records that the statues were not on view during his visit.55 Only the standing "korai" and the seated goddesses show any consistency of representation among numerous renderings, as if they might be imitating important works. The "korai," however, probably were developed from bronze mirror caryatids (pp. 26-27), and although the seated goddesses could imitate a cult statue, the type is generic, and the stylistic and formal changes in the heads from the 5th to the 4th centuries B.C. speak of a type more capable of development than one fixed to a cult statue. Aphrodite Although Aphrodite's functions and iconography sometimes overlap those of Demeter and Kore, she is unquestionably portrayed in Hellenistic figurines, almost nude, leaning on a column, her torso framed by the folds of a mantle (pp. 172-173). That figurines of Aphrodite should have been dedicated at the Acrocorinth sanctuary is not unexpected, given her close relationship with Persephone at Lokroi (p. 170), but the quantity of figurines referring to Aphrodite in one way or another is surprising. In addition to the nude renderings, there are others draped in a mantle with no garment beneath, which have been assigned to Aphrodite on the basis of a similar type identifiable in a mythological context in vase painting (pp. 135-136). Still other draped female 50 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 133-134, no. 292, fig. 34. 51 Sourvinou-Inwood 1978. 52 For Hades beside Kore at Lokroi, together with a rooster, see Pruckner 1968, e.g., pp. 75-76, type 86, fig. 14, pl. 22. 53 Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 70-72. 4 Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 333. 55 For the text and commentary, see Corinth XVIII, iii, pp. 3-4.</page><page sequence="351">THE FIGURINES AND THE CULT 331 figurines also could represent Aphrodite, on the basis of drapery arrangement, type of support, or the presence of Eros (p. 174). Heads wearing a crown or polos with crenellations are likely to be Aphrodite because she was the city goddess (p. 271). It was also suggested above (pp. 171-172) that some of the articulated "dolls" were dedicated to Aphrodite rather than to Kore. The possible cultic role of Aphrodite at the sanctuary has been discussed in detail above (pp. 169-170). Very briefly, in sum, while Aphrodite's persona in myth and art projects a sophisticated, freewheeling sexuality, which is directly opposed to the innocence of Kore and the responsible motherhood of Demeter, nevertheless, as protectress of the city and kourotrophos in her own right (p. 71), her role must have been to reinforce, not diminish, the social functions of Demeter as patroness of marriage and nurturer of children. Indeed, her presence may have enhanced the acceptability of marriage by emphasizing its erotic as well as its social aspect. Further, her worship had a chthonic aspect,56 and her images, viewed in the context of Kore's sanctuary, would have expressed for the worshiper the unity of erotic and chthonic that is fundamental in Greek religion.57 Nymphs The association of nymphs in myth and art with love, marriage, and the protection of children could account for the dedication of figurines representing them at the sanctuary; they also received bridal(?) sacrifice at the nearby Pitsa cave (p. 188, note 430). The nymphs are recognized here in seminude figures perched on rocky seats (pp. 178-180). Artemis Among the earlier figurines, the only goddess identifiable with certainty, by the uniqueness of her hunting attributes, is Artemis, although in only a few 5th-century B.C. lingering Archaic examples (MF-12009, MF-13561).58 In addition, there are a few possible representations of the Hellenistic period (p. 183). It is certainly not uncommon to find "visiting" deities represented in the sanctuaries of other gods,59 and the association of Artemis with children and coming-of-age, overlapping one of the apparent concerns of this cult, probably is the reason for her representation among the figurines. The chthonic association of Artemis with Hekate could also have been a factor. She may have been more prominent after the rebuilding of the sanctuary in Roman times, since there are three clearly identifiable Roman Artemis figurines, a substantial showing among the proportionately very small number of figurines preserved for that period (pp. 314, 316). Nike, Athena(?), and Cybele(?) The ties of the remaining three goddesses to this cult are rather weak, to judge from the figurines. The few images of Nike are small and of poor quality (pp. 183-184); the two possible figurines of Athena are a fragment of a female figure holding an owl, and a Roman helmeted head (pp. 183, 315); Cybele is accounted for only in reminiscences of her iconography in the Middle Hellenistic "priestess" type, but if worshipers recognized her because they were familiar with images of the Mother of the Gods at her nearby shrine, a mental link might have been made with Demeter (pp. 254-255). The thymiaterion type with a female bust and a floral cup is known in the worship of Cybele in Asia Minor (p. 75, note 361), although the type could have been dedicated in the Acrocorinth sanctuary to Demeter or Kore as well. Of these three goddesses, Cybele is the one most "at home" in the sanctuary. 56 C. K. Williams 1986, p. 12, note 5, with bibliography. 57 Zuntz 1971, pp. 174-175. 58 Publication forthcoming. 59 Alroth 1987.</page><page sequence="352">332 SUMMARIES Eros Among the small number of figurines representing Eros, no single predominant type emerges but rather an array of seated and flying types, including both youths and babies (pp. 181-182). In addition, at least one of the heads discussed under the category of children may represent Eros, although no attributes are preserved (p. 193). The potential association of Eros with this sanctuary is most obviously through Aphrodite, but he is also connected iconographically with Dionysos.60 He may have been viewed here as Eros-Thanatos, and his chthonic as well as fertility functions emphasized. Dionysos and His Circle (Silenos, Satyrs, Pan) The worship of Dionysos at the Acrocorinth sanctuary is attested epigraphically (p. 76). Dionysos himself, however, is represented only in the form of masks (pp. 76-78) and perhaps as a baby, originally carried by Silenos (p. 196). Of his followers, there are a few figurines of Silenoi and satyrs from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (pp. 78, 199-200); Classical and Hellenistic figurines of Pan are also found (pp. 78-79, 199-200). The ties of Dionysos to the sanctuary are likely to have been strong through the association of his name and images with fertility and the Underworld. He paralleled Demeter in the provision of wine to her grain and was referred to as her companion (p. 76, note 370). He appears before the enthroned Persephone on the Lokroi plaques.61 Evidence from Sparta and Olympia that Dionysos was a patron of prenuptial rituals for girls,62 and from elsewhere that he may also have been concerned with rites of passage for youths and boys,63 suggests that some of the cult activities of this nature at the sanctuary, evidenced by the numerous figurines of children and young people, may have been directed toward him. Two figurines of boys and one of a girl carry grapes, a symbol specifically associated with Dionysos (pp. 185, 188, 191, 194). The large mask C273 may have been affixed to a pillar image of Dionysos or perhaps was placed in a liknon during the ritual (pp. 77-78). If it was so used, it would have been a cult image rather than a dedication, unless it served both functions. None of the masks, large or small, can be dated later than the 4th century B.C., or perhaps the early 3rd, but the significance of this is uncertain, since references to Dionysos continue into the Hellenistic period through figurines of his circle or of actors and through offerings carried by votaries. In the Roman sanctuary, Dionysos must be the referent of a group of theatrical masks.64 Unknown Male Deity(?) The enthroned bearded male figure wearing a pilos C278 could perhaps represent Hades. Because similar figurines hold mortars, however, he may be instead a minor local deity whose name is not recorded but who functioned as a protector of the storage and processing of grain and as such could be honored under the wing of Demeter, the provider of grain (pp. 79-80). The Hero(es) The assemblage of figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary includes numerous exam- ples of types associated elsewhere in Corinth with hero cult:65 horse-riders (p. 60), Archaic goddesses with moldmade heads and applied necklaces on handmade bodies,66 banqueters (pp. 65-68), lingering Archaic standing "korai" (p. 23, note 1), birds (pp. 268-269), a votive 60 On the Eros-Dionysos link as seen in vase painting, see Albert 1979, pp. 49-189. 61 Pruckner 1968, p. 78, type 107, pl. 25:5. 62 Serwint 1993, pp. 418-419. 63 E.g., possibly in the Kabeirion at Thebes, Burkert 1985, p. 281; the subject is currently being researched by G.

On the basis of the above types, it seems likely that at least one hero was honored there. Most of the horse-riders are Archaic (or surviving Archaic) handmade figurines, a type that was made at Corinth from the later 7th century B.C. onward. Until the Archaic figurines from the sanctuary are fully studied, their precise date of introduction will be uncertain, but if the horse-riders began to be dedicated in the sanctuary in the later 7th century B.C., together with another early type, the goddesses with moldmade heads and necklaces, the introduction of hero cult tere could perhaps be approximately coeval with the beginning of the Heroon of the Crossroads in the Forum area, which shows similar figurines,68 in the Early Corinthian period. The presence of a heroon within or ery close to a sanctuary of a major deity is by no means unusual.69 To use an example from a Peloponnesian sanctuary, Pausanias (2.35.9) records that a temple of the hero Klymenos stood opposite that ofDemeter Chthonia at Hermione and that he received sacrifices. Pausanias' further comment, that Klymenos is a cult title of Hades, suggests that a hero at the Acrocorinth sanctuary could have been similarly understood to signify Hades, who is not otherwise represented there, or to serve as an intermediary to the fearsome god of the Underworld. At Morgantina, Hades is thought possibly to have been represented as a youth.70 On the other hand, the hero might be similar to the Eleusinian Triptolemos, emphasizing the agricultural rather than the chthonic aspects of the cult and serving as an intermediary to Demeter. In still another possible interpretation, the figurines might have been offered not to one specific cultic hero but to each family's ancestral hero, by way of placing the cult of the household under the protection of Demeter Epoikidie (p. 68). It is worth noting that while the horse-riders, the goddesses, and many of the birds are Archaic productions, the banqueters, standing "korai," and the votive shield were not produced until the first or second quarter of the 5th century B.C. It may be concluded either that a change in the hero cult took place or perhaps that worship intensified at this time. The honoring of a hero or heroes may not have been part of the functions of the sanctuary to the end of its history, but it is not quite clear when the custom actually stopped. The handmade horse-riders may have been dedicated even into the 4th century B.C., as part of the conservative production of the Potters' Quarter workshops. After the demise of the Potters' Quarter in the 320s B.C., these handmade horse-riders were replaced by moldmade rider plaques produced elsewhere in Corinth; however, only one example of this new type was found in the sanctuary (pp. 271-272). Similarly, there is no clear evidence that the banqueter types, which also were made in the Potters' Quarter, were replaced by the larger, bearded banqueters with seated women at their feet, which are typical of the 3rd century B.C. (p. 67). It is therefore possible that in the later 4th century B.C. either the custom of dedicating figurines to a hero or heroes changed, perhaps becoming the offering of other, perishable votives of which we have no traces, or more likely, since the dedication of figurines was characteristic of hero cult elsewhere in Corinth both before and after this date, the cult was discontinued or moved to another, perhaps more easily accessible location. In the 3rd century B.C., deposits of the new "heroic" figurine types appear in the Forum area, suggesting new foundations there, especially in and near the South Stoa.71 Conceivably, the political realities of the later 4th century B.C. influenced some changes in local hero cult, which we see reflected in the changing patterns of coroplastic offerings. 67 Publication of the helmets and stele is forthcoming with the miscellaneous finds. 68 C.

The presentation of votives was a highly personal affair, even though enacted in a public arena, often for publicly sanctioned purposes, since it was a direct communication from the votary to the deity, either requesting assistance or giving thanks for perceived help.72 Because the transaction so closely involved the votary, one might assume that when a figurine represents a mortal, it must be the votary. A figurine need not represent a cult activity, however, but may only be symbolic of an idea embodied in the cult (p. 324). Further, in some cases, the subject clearly cannot be the votary; for example, when the subject is a baby, the dedicator is likely to be a parent or would-be parent. But whoever actually carried the figurine to the offering place, and whether the narrative is direct or symbolic, some information emerges about who participated in the rituals and for what reasons. Another related and also misleading assumption is that if the figurines from a sanctuary are predominantly female in type, the cult must have been celebrated mainly by women. To be sure, certain rituals celebrated in honor of Demeter in Athens and elsewhere were, on the basis of written evidence, restricted to women,73 but votive reliefs show Demeter approached by whole families74 or by groups of men,75 not to mention the large number of male Eleusinian mystai. In addition, other deities appear to have been honored at the sanctuary besides Demeter and Kore, and masculine names of worshipers are recorded among the finds. Therefore, the relative paucity of male figurine types at the sanctuary could cause us to undervalue the participation of men in the cult.76 In any case, that youths and boys participated in rituals at the sanctuary is fairly certain. On the evidence of the terracotta sculpture, young (i.e., beardless) males and boys played a role in the cult, bringing offerings of small animals and other gifts.77 This evidence is supported by the male figurine types, most of which are, indeed, youths and boys, although they do not correspond to the sculpture in style or detail. A fragmentary kotyle from the sanctuary, dated to the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. or slightly earlier, is painted with a scene of youths running to the right; another fragment of the same vessel shows the head of Persephone, identified by an inscription.78 Since she faces left, the youths must have been running toward her, but since the vessel is so fragmentary, it is uncertain whether Demeter or another deity was also represented on it. This painting is thought to represent a cult activity of the sanctuary, although it is not clear how races could have been accommodated within its boundaries; the actual running may have been done outside the premises, perhaps on the way to the sanctuary in advance of the processions.79 The youthful male figurines of the early 5th century B.C., which are nude but for a scarflike mantle over the shoulders, help to confirm the connection of the painting, in which the youths are similarly clad, with a cult activity at the sanctuary. Since nudity is consonant with initiation rituals (p. 61), it seems fair to suggest that this figurine type was dedicated to Kore at a festival incorporating social initiation rituals for youths.80 The figurines 72 For a useful collection of epigraphic evidence for the intent behind gift-giving, see Van Straten 1981, pp. 90-104. 73 See examples in Bookidis 1993, pp. 50, 57, 60, note 5. 74 E.g., a relief in Athens, Van Straten 1995, p. 291, no.

Nearly 20 percent of the figurines from the Sanctuary of Demeter at S. Nicola di Albanella are male types: Cipriani 1989, especially pp. 140-141. 76 The male figurine types from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, taken as a whole, would include not only votaries, but also deities, banqueters, isolated male heads, actors and grotesques, and Archaic handmade horse-riders, which are not included in this volume. Evidence for participation in the cult, however, should be sought only among the votaries. Including both standing youths and boys, these number less than fifty figurines for the Classical and Hellenistic periods. For the Archaic period, there are only a few recognizable males, apart from the horse-riders; some of the handmade figurines are of uncertain gender. 77 Publication forthcoming by Nancy Bookidis. 78 Corinth XVIII, i, pp. 133-134, no. 292, fig. 34: Pemberton 1978, pp. 30-31, 33. 79 On the processions, see Corinth XVIII, iii, p. 429. 80 The bibliography of works on male and female initia- tion is considerable; for basic works and newer works with</page><page sequence="355">THE FIGURINES AND THE CULT 335 presumably show the youths bringing offerings to Kore, either before or after the race; the simple headdress made of a strip of clay may have been intended as a wreath, perhaps of victory. The identifiable offerings are a rooster, which is an attribute of the chthonic deities, a lyre, an athlete's aryballos, and a knucklebone bag. The last three could perhaps be objects associated with the pastimes of youth, which were symbolically relinquished at the transition to adulthood (pp. 126, 194). An inscribed Corinthian aryballos from the Temple of Apollo showing a dancing chorus of nude youths81 could perhaps be associated with initiations because of the nudity. Since the figures are slender and only slightly shorter than the adult flutist, they would be postpubescent, and comparable in age to the figurines of youths from the sanctuary. There is no evidence, however, to connect this event to the Acrocorinth rituals. A few handmade Archaic nude male figurines may possibly be the forerunners of this type;82 one member of this group is beardless and has long hair (MF-10374), and others have a strip headdress (e.g., MF-1 1053) like that of the Classical youths. If these figurines are indeed forerunners, initiations could already have existed in the Archaic period. Intermediate between these handmade figurines and the Early Classical type are two Late Archaic heads of youths (MF-73-97, MF-11856) and a fragmentary plaque (MF- 11884), although only the plaque, which preserves nude legs and mantle folds at the side, has any real claim to be of a suitable type. The 5th-century B.C. figurines of youths appear to be in their early teens. The dedication of similar figurines probably continued into the 4th century B.C., since they were made in the Potters' Quarter, which conservatively produced 5th-century B.C. types long after they were first designed. After the demise of the Potters' Quarter in the 320s B.C., a small number of figurines of nude youths takes the place of the Classical type, suggesting that the rituals for youths continued. Another group of semidraped youths is introduced, however, which does not fit into the athletic activities. What is interesting is that the Early Hellenistic nude youths are empty handed, while offerings very similar to those of the Classical youths are found in the hands of contemporary figurines of younger boys, not more than about six years of age, even when offerings such as athletic equipment are not really suitable. These boys are also nude, sometimes with a mantle over the shoulder. If these figurines can be trusted to describe the ritual, the youths may have continued to participate in races into the Early Hellenistic period, while the responsibility of carrying offerings to Kore was handed over to small boys, perhaps by way of marking the point in their lives at which they were separated from the gynaikeion and began their formal education.83 Speaking generally of Greek religion, there is ample evidence in literary and artistic sources that children were included in ritual and were educated by observing the religious conduct of adults (p. 194). On the basis of the slim evidence available, we can try to place these activities within the calendar year. One of the nude boy figurines (H319) and another semidraped figurine representing either a chubby youth or a boy (H302) carry grapes. Floral remains recovered from a limited area through flotation include grape, pomegranate, and fig, suggesting that one festival may have taken place in the late summer or early autumn,84 although the physical evidence is very slight and such fruits could have been preserved into another season by drying or other means. The offering of grapes by the boys, taken together with nudity of most of the youths and the boys (which suggests reasonably warm weather) and the running of races (which would have been better accomplished on dry ground), suggests that initiation rites for young males may have taken place at this time. The grapes also make symbolic reference to Dionysos, who may bibliography, see Brelich 1969, esp. pp. 14-44; Van Gennep 1960 (1909); Eliade 1958; La Fontaine 1986; Dowden 1989; Lincoln 1991; Richards 1982; Cole 1984; Serwint 1993; Vidal- Naquet 1986; Sourvinou-Inwood 1988; Vernant 1991; Brule 1987; R.

The only remaining substantial group of male figurines consists of the baby boys, who probably should be understood symbolically as wished-for, healthy children and could have been participants only insofar as babies may have been brought to the sanctuary for blessing. The custom of presenting babies to a goddess is documented in Corinthian vase painting in the late 6th to early 5th century B.C. (see below); it is also documented elsewhere, for example, figurines of women carrying small children on their shoulders were found at the Thesmophorion at Bitalemi, and there is an apparent survival of this custom at that site into modern times.85 If the foregoing interpretation is correct, three ceremonies at the Acrocorinth sanctuary are indicated for a Corinthian boy, although the evidence belongs to different periods: he would have been brought as a baby by his mother, probably to Demeter or Kore, to increase his chances of survival (Late Archaic and Classical periods); at the age of about six he would have brought offerings, probably to Kore or Dionysos, to mark the beginning of the socialization process (Early Hellenistic period); and on reaching puberty, he would have participated in races in honor of Kore (Late Archaic period) and brought offerings to her (Classical period). The Corinthian painted vases mentioned in the preceding paragraph are useful pieces of evidence; taken together, they are thought to depict a "Frauenfest."86 Various theories have been put forward to identify the deity or deities being honored; the theory most cogently argued to date gives the festival to Artemis, but in light of the finds from the Acrocorinth sanctuary, this identi- fication should be reconsidered. The question of how far vase painting is to be taken as literal rep- resentation of ritual is a difficult one,87 but it seems best to take each painting or group of paintings as a separate case, depending upon other evidence. The Corinthian "Frauenfest" vases cannot be discussed in detail here, but briefly they appear to combine functional and signifying elements, nearly all of which can be accounted for at the Demeter sanctuary among the figurines or other finds: the predominance of women, the kourotrophic goddesses, the presence of little girls, the references to Dionysos, and dancing; the male banqueters could be associated with the hero(es) of the sanctuary; and the spinners88 and the women carrying a robe could signify the work of women honoring Demeter of the Household (the Demeter or Kore on a Sam Wide group plate in Athens sits on a throne covered with a very elaborate cloth [p. 43]). Further, an example of the unusual bottle shape typical of some of the "Frauenfest" vases, unfortunately fragmentary but recognizable in shape, was found in the sanctuary.89 If the connection between the "Frauenfest" vases and the sanctuary is correct, the paintings may help to explain the figurines of girls, although it must be kept in mind that the figurines are Early Hellenistic, much later in date than the vase paintings. The girls on the "Frauenfest" vases are distinctly shorter than the women, reaching to the chests of the women on bottles in Beziers and Montpellier90 and only to the waist on an example in London.91 While the schematic drawing does not reveal their ages precisely, their relatively small size should indicate that they are intended to be very young, probably prepubescent.92 The inclusion of prepubescent girls in rituals of Demeter and Kore is known elsewhere. For example, at the Thesmophorion at Eretria, where the figurine assemblage consists largely of children and young women, there are two female age groups, four-five and fourteen-sixteen years.93 Three age groups are accounted for in the girls' races at the Heraia at Olympia, on the basis of literary 85 Orlandini 1966, pp. 32-33, pi.

The figurines of young female votaries from the Acrocorinth sanctuary form two clear groups, one consisting of children of less than ten years, the other of young women in their mid- to late teens (pp. 126-127). Between these two groups are a number of less easily defined figures, with neither the stocky forms of children nor the shapely ones of young women; perhaps they are intended to show approaching adolescence, and if so, they could correspond with the middle group at Brauron. Unfortunately, these intermediate figurines are also of poorer workmanship than the others, which could account for the apparent differences. In the absence of clear evidence for three age groups, it is here assumed that there th thewere only two, as at Eretria, pre- and postpubescent, until further evidence should prove differently. In any case, there is no evidence at Corinth for a single ritual encompassing both groups, like the girls' races at Olympia and Brauron. Nevertheless, the crowning of the girls with wreaths on the "Frauenfest" vases is suggestive of agonistic victory and the possible running of races by at least prepubescent Corinthian girls. Wreaths could have been associated more generally with participation in a festival,95 but the portrayal of the girls in the act of being crowned suggests that a more specific interpretation is permissible. It should be remembered, however, that the extant "Frauenfest" vases do not show running girls. Given that these scenes of crowning incorporate kourotrophic figures, the ritual for the younger, prepubescent girls could be construed as a form of social initiation, paralleling that suggested above for the boys of about six years, and preparing them at an early age for their future role in society. The myth of the rape of Kore has been interpreted to reflect initiation,96 but this evidence does not help to explain the figurines, which represent girls younger than Kore at the time of her abduction. Nevertheless, the likely association of Demeter and Kore with female initiation on literary grounds is helpful. Some of the figurines of little girls, in spite of their youth, press one hand to the abdomen, in a gesture usually associated with pregnancy (p. 127). The inclusion in the "Frauenfest" paintings of prepubescent girls in a ceremony in which a goddess functioned as kourotrophos could clarify the gesture of the figurines. That is, in the joyful context of physical activity and celebration, the girls were shown, and they accepted, what their lives as adults would entail.97 If little girls received their cultic and social lessons at the same time of year as little boys, the festival on the vase would also have taken place in the late summer or early autumn. One figurine of a seated little girl (H339) carries grapes, like the above-mentioned figurines of boys. The figurines of the older group are very different, in that they show fully matured young women, who wear their hair unbound and carry piglets (pp. 1 17-124). If these figurines are not only symbolic and a specific ritual is being described, it is likely to have been bridal, parallel to the proteleia recorded for Greek marriage elsewhere (p. 119). That is, the figurines show that a sacrifice is about to be made, in this case a piglet, and the hair is about to be shorn. Although the customs of one polis cannot automatically be transferred to another, one may mention that the customary month for weddings elsewhere in Greece was Gamelion (January-February), the time of the sacred marriage of Zeus and Hera.98 Whether there was a specific festival in Corinth at which all prospective brides appeared,99 or families came separately with their new brides, 94 Sourvinou-Inwood 1988, pp. 25-30. 95 On the use of wreaths in the cults of Demeter and Kore, see Blech 1982, pp. 252-257. 96 Lincoln 1991, pp. 77-90. 97 On ethnographic evidence for the aim of girls' social ini- tiation rites being to emphasize the responsibilities of marriage and adult life, and to reinforce the prevailing moral order, see Richards 1982; La Fontaine 1986, pp. 169-179. On the use of figurines to reinforce the lessons, see Cory 1956, pp. 52-65, 82-96, 114-125, 144-151; see also Talalay 1993, pp. 40-42. 98 Deubner 1956, p. 117. 99 On the Cretan custom of confining marriages to a specific</page><page sequence="358">338 SUMMARIES it is possible that the Corinthians also married at this time of year, and if this is true, this group of figurines may reflect rituals at the sanctuary during the winter. The bridal ritual is likely to have been addressed to Demeter, whose patronage of marriage is known elsewhere (p. 36) and in whose honor piglets were often sacrificed. As for the chronology of this ritual, figurines of young women with piglets are uncommon at the sanctuary before the later 4th century B.C. There is one Early Classical example (C1), but the gap between this one and the large Early Hellenistic group must be filled in mainly with a small number of Argive imports (pp. 286-287). Perhaps before the Early Hellenistic period, a different figurine type was offered by brides. Two possible candidates are the Classical figurines of young women similarly garbed in the unbelted peplos (pp. 29-30), but without offerings, and the articulated "dolls" (pp. 48-53). The series of votaries carrying piglets gradually diminished during the 3rd century B.C. Another piglet-carrying type, the Middle Hellenistic "priestess," followed, but it appears to have had a different meaning, which is discussed below (p. 340). Another related, winter cult activity at the sanctuary might possibly be illustrated by the female figurines muffled in their mantles, especially the mantled dancers. When seen in context in vase painting or on mirror covers, muffled figures represent brides or Dionysiac revelers (pp. 152-153). The winter was the time of the Athenian Lenaia, which included the mountain revels of maenads and probably the erection of mask idols of Dionysos. 100 On the calendar relief in Athens, the emblem for the winter month of Gamelion is a mantled dancer (p. 153, note 235). If the Corinthians celebrated a winter festival, the mantled dancers from the sanctuary could perhaps represent the local Dionysiac revelers (pp. 152-153). The large mask of Dionysos C273, which is suitable for hanging on a pillar or placing in a liknon, could have been a ritual object in such a festival, at which the small masks of Dionysos (pp. 76-78) might also have been dedicated. The visits of a Corinthian woman to the Acrocorinth sanctuary during her lifetime thus can be partially outlined by the finds. As in the case of the males (see above), the evidence is not chronologically consistent. Whether she was presented to the goddesses as a baby, as her brothers probably were, is unknown. Whether or not she was given formal education to parallel that of the boys, her education in her future duties as a wife and mother may have begun before the age of ten years (Early Hellenistic period). At that time, she may have been introduced, in the company of adult women, to the place in the sanctuary where kourotrophic rituals were held; it is possible that she participated in a race and was crowned if she won (Late Archaic period). We cannot know whether all girls of suitable age participated in such rituals, the wreathed girl on the vases then being symbolic of all the girls, or only one or a few. Neither do we yet know whether there were further rituals at or near puberty (see below), but at the time of her marriage in the middle to late teens, she returned to the sanctuary to sacrifice a piglet (Classical and Early Hellenistic periods) and to have her hair ritually cut (Early Hellenistic period). Thereafter, she would return as a mother to present her babies and later, to bring her children for initiation, to ask for children if necessary, and perhaps to participate in the dances or simply to honor the protecting deity of her household. While the principal deities have been suggested, to whom the above-postulated rituals might have been addressed, such distinctions could not have been absolute. For example, as mentioned already, Aphrodite had a kourotrophic function elsewhere; Dionysos was associated elsewhere with girls' initiations, and the pig was also his sacrificial animal; Aphrodite and the nymphs also were associated with marriage, the latter at the nearby Pitsa cave. One has to assume that while the most popular types of figurines are likely to point to some consistent ritual use, the deities time, see R. Garland 1990, p. 219; for the suggestion that bridal rituals at festivals point to group marriage, see Dowden 1989, pp. 200-201. 100 Deubner 1956, pp. 123-134; Parke 1977, pp. 104-106; Simon 1983, pp. 100-101.</page><page sequence="359">THE FIGURINES AND THE CULT 339 to whom they were addressed represented to the dedicators power over some facet of life also controlled by other deities. The likelihood that these votives could have been applied to more than one deity, with an altered sense, is suggested by the case of the articulated "dolls," most of them nude, which were dedicated at the sanctuary in very large numbers. After years of study, there is still a question about this class of figurines that has not been satisfactorily answered, although it should be the clue to their meaning: that is, why are the limbs articulated? The human body is disjointed in other types, specifically in anatomical votives and also in Neolithic figurines that consist only of a partial body.101 The fragmentation of the body in anatomical votives was meant to call attention to the part of the body that needed to be cured. The use and meaning of Neolithic partial figurines are still under discussion, but ethnographic evidence points to the widespread symbolic use of the human body and its parts.102 At a superficial level, the movement of the limbs of an articulated "doll" may well have been entertaining, but this can hardly have been the reason why so many of this class of votives were dedicated. With more than eight hundred nude "dolls" surviving, thousands must have been brought to the sanctuary over the years. A clue to a deeper level of meaning may be found in the interpretation of the nude, Attic limbless "torso dolls" as girls' votives for a successful puberty.103 In the articulated "dolls," a similar attention is drawn to the naked torso not by eliminating limbs altogether but by making them adjuncts to the centrally important torso. Just as figurines in modern African initiation rituals help to teach girls what will be expected of them as wives,104 the ancient Corinthian "dolls" could have taught the powerful lesson that a girl's primary value resided in her nude torso, the vehicle for child-bearing and nourishment.105 While the "dolls" may have conveyed these ideas to girls through their distinctive form, they still functioned as votive gifts. The receiving deities could have been Kore, through identification of the girls with her (pp. 49-50), or Aphrodite, who may have received the "dolls" that wear the elaborate coiffures of hierodouloi; if the "dolls" are to be identified with the young votaries, these coiffures transform them into hierodouloi, and the "dolls" might then be viewed as substitute dedications to Aphrodite in place of the girls themselves (pp. 171-172). However they are interpreted, it is clear that, although the term "doll" is a convenient appellation, these figurines were not toys in anything but a symbolic sense; in the context of the sanctuary, they were cult objects, whose special significance is shown by the large numbers in which they were dedicated. Who dedicated these figurines? The girls who hold "dolls" on Attic grave reliefs are either adolescent or clearly prepubescent. 106 If a similar association obtained at Corinth, the articulated "dolls" may have been dedicated by girls at or approaching the time of puberty. After the demise of the Potters' Quarter, at which most of the "dolls" were made, in the 320s B.C., the type was replaced by seated "dolls," for which there is little evidence at the sanctuary; a few late, usually poor versions of the customary dangling type probably belong to the 3rd century B.C. Therefore, it is likely that the custom of dedicating "dolls" was rare after the later 4th century B.C. The above discussion accounts for the major figurine types dedicated at the Acrocorinth sanctuary. Other, smaller groups point to activities generally associated with worship, such as water carrying, perhaps in procession (p. 38), which could have belonged to any set ritual, 10' Talalay 1993, pp. 31, 49-50. 102 Talalay 1993, p. 50, with bibliography. 103 Reilly 1997. 104 Cory 1956, pp. 52-65, 82-96, 114-125, 144-151. 105 As Reilly (1997, pp. 164-165), working independently of the present study, has stated with regard to the Attic limb- less "dolls": "These figures were icons or emblems of the desired qualities of femininity. In dedicating her votive she probably learned the appropriate attitudes towards her body and sexuality. These figures taught her to desire the body that would enable her to fulfill the roles of bride, wife, and mother. The anatomical votive in particular, an image of the impor- tant parts, taught her the parts that really mattered." An- cient Egyptian "dolls" are similarly now understood as fertility figures: Quirke 1992, pp. 124-125, figs. 72-74. 106 Reilly 1997, p. 159.</page><page sequence="360">340 SUMMARIES or torch bearing (p. 124), which suggests either chthonic deities or marriage. That there is an example of parody of the hydriaphoros (p. 196) suggests that a water-carrying element actually existed in the ritual. Were such parodies actually performed in the sanctuary in the tradition of buffoonery for Demeter? Although there are quite a few figurines of dancers, there is surprisingly little reference to musical instruments, unlike the Thesmophorion at Eretria, which yielded many figurines of female musicians. Does this mean that the dancers are symbolic of bridals or Dionysiac revels but do not illustrate actual cultic activities? But there are parodies of mantled dancers (p. 196), which support the existence of the activity. There are female figures and children on simple seats, holding offerings. Why are they seated? They are not enthroned, and there is no other sign of divinity, such as the polos. Perhaps they are waiting their turn to dedicate offerings. One female type sits in a curved wicker chair, a type of seat specified for the "sacred women" of the Andanian Mysteries (p. 45). Perhaps these figurines represent cult officials or priestesses of the Acrocorinth sanctuary. The old woman H389 could be a priestess, since old priestesses are documented elsewhere in Demeter's cults (p. 200), but the only other consistent type that could possibly represent a priestess is the Middle Hellenistic type carrying a piglet and torch and sometimes wearing a sacrificial apron (pp. 250-255). In this case, there are attributes recalling a goddess as well (the polos, the dignified, hieratic bearing, and a resemblance to the iconography of Cybele) that speak for a representation of Demeter about to sacrifice a piglet. The overlap of types, however, is what is significant about this group, bringing us back to the initial thesis that some types incorporate qualities of both mortals and deities, probably to reinforce the efficacy of ritual through identification. This type came into being after the series of votaries carrying piglets came to an end. Was it a replacement in bridal rituals? If so, there was a shift away from representing the mortal bride toward a rendering more like a goddess or priestess. Although the votary herself presumably still offered the figurine, the functional figure in the transaction between offerant and deity was no longer the mortal votary represented as herself, but either the votary in the guise of the goddess or an official of the cult. This imagery, I believe, suggests some change in the perception of this transaction, in which the mortal votary in her own shape was no longer considered sufficiently effective (p. 255). The Early Hellenistic figurines of children are not replaced in the later 3rd and early 2nd centuries B.C., nor are the youths, although there are handsome new female types belonging to this period. Did the old customs die out with time, or were they moved to the patronage of other deities? Was there some deterioration of the existing age-class system by the 3rd century B.c.? Pausanias (2.3.6) mentions a ritual in which Corinthian children cut their hair and wore black in honor of Medea's children; this ritual is now thought to have been a form of initiation, in which seven boys and seven girls withdrew to the temenos of Hera Akraia.107 Pausanias says that the ritual was discontinued when the city was destroyed, which implies that it was in existence immediately before 146 B.C. Was the function of initiating children transferred in the 3rd century B.C. from Demeter to Hera? There still remain many figurines that do not form consistent groups and therefore are hard to connect to rites so established in custom as to become referents for figurine types. There are many draped female figurines without the offerings expected of votary types, which may simply represent visitors to the shrine. Just as not everyone who attends church takes communion, it need not have been necessary to approach the deities for any particular purpose. Women who already had gone through the rituals of childhood and marriage, and who no longer sought children, might nevertheless have wished to offer something to ensure divine protection for their families 107 Brelich 1969, pp. 355-365, including further sources for this ritual; Brule 1987, pp. 218-221;Johnston 1997.</page><page sequence="361">THE FIGURINES AND OTHER ARTS 341 and households. Draped female figurines might then simply have represented such women, to remind the goddesses of their continuing faithfulness to the cult. The final pieces of evidence for ritual are the offerings carried by some of the figurines, although none of these can be firmly tied to specific festivals. Balls (pp. 125-126) are likely to fall into the category of the toys of childhood relinquished symbolically upon their owner's arrival at marriageable age. A small box also may have been a bridal offering (p. 273). The cakes are for the most part different from those on the model likna, and two types might possibly parallel the aidoia of the Athenian Thesmophoria (pp. 272-273). The differences suggest that some types of cakes may have been offered at a different ritual than the model likna; such a custom need not be surprising in light of the widespread modern customs of baking for various religious holidays special breads and cakes, which are not prepared at any other time. There are a few representations of floral offerings, one of them perhaps showing the gathering of wild roses (pp. 124-125), which might suggest an early summer festival, that is, at the time of the harvesting and threshing of grain, but the evidence of the figurines is very scanty, and the flowers probably just refer to Kore's myth. There is one piece of coroplastic evidence for the dedication of cloth, perhaps a woven fillet or hairband (p. 273). It is also possible that incense was burned in the thymiateria (p. 75), but the receptacles that would show traces of burning are missing; further, there is no clear supporting evidence for thymiateria among the Greek pottery from the sanctuary. 108 For the Roman period, too few figurines were found to derive significant information from this class of votives. There appears, however, to have been a continuing interest in children109 and continued reference to Aphrodite and to Dionysos (in the form of theatrical masksl10). The one surprise is the strong showing, in this small group of figurines, of Artemis, who perhaps took over the role of protectress of the young, as she was honored elsewhere in Greece. It will be apparent to the reader that the interpretations of cultic activity in the Acrocorinth sanctuary provided above aov re speculative to a greater or lesser degree. Whenever possible, they have been supported by external evidence, but because of the nature of the evidence, they are at best not more than reasonable inferences based upon available material. In the main, they are intended to show how coroplastic evidence may be used to illuminate cult practice and to encourage further study and discussion. THE FIGURINES AND OTHER ARTS The following discussion brings together the observations made in the course of this study re- garding the relationship of the figurines to other arts. The purpose of this summary is to clarify the workings of the Corinthian coroplastic industry. An important key to the nature of the industry is to understand how the archetypes were created from which the molds were made. Although the manufacture of figurines required knowledge of the preparation and firing of clay, it did not necessarily presuppose artistic ability and training, nor was the preparation of archetypes always the responsibility of the coroplast. In a paper on the nature of the Corinthian coroplastic industry as a whole,111 I examined the uses to which the very large production of figurines was put in Corinth in different periods and came to the conclusion that their major function was as votives in shrines. Relatively few figurines were deposited in graves, and there is little evidence for purely decorative use. A mainly votive function would tie the production to the seasonal pattern of festivals, when the bulk of figurines would have been offered, even allowing for sporadic visits to shrines at other times of the year. 108 Corinth XVIII, i, p. 61. For the Roman thymiateria, see Corinth XVIII, ii, pp. 66-71. 109 This interest is supported by the Roman marble portraits of girls, S-2666 and S-2667 (Stroud 1965, p. 21, pl. 10:b, c). 11 Publication forthcoming with the miscellaneous finds. ll Merker, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="362">342 SUMMARIES Taking into account that figurines were not customarily offered to all the deities worshiped in Corinth, the coroplasts probably were seasonal workers with other sources oflivelihood. Although Corinthian figurines were widely exported, most of the exports were limited to a small range of lingering Archaic types produced in the Potters' Quarter (see p. 23, note 1). Consequently, few craftsmen were able to supplement their work through exports. The seasonal nature of the industry would explain why workshop groupings of technically related figurines are very small and diverge widely from one another (see the summary of workshops on pp. 344-346). It also would explain why, apart from the Potters' Quarter, there is little sense of continuity. One concludes that artisans who had access to the necessary materials and facilities and had the expertise to prepare and fire clay were able to take the opportunities for making and selling figurines as they arose, without being what we would consider fully competent, full-time "professionals." Indeed, the first figurines from the Potters' Quarter show by their technique and materials that they were made by potters.112 In addition to pottery, however, Corinthian artisans manufactured terracotta sculpture, architectural revetments, and household items such as mortars, miniature altars, and loomweights. Molds were employed for much of this work, and the coarser clay used for such products usually was covered with finely textured clay like that used for figurines. Artisans accustomed to work of this nature would have had the expertise to prepare the clay for figurines and to mold and fire them, but they would not have had the necessary artistic skills, at least at miniature scale. There are abundant examples among the figurines from the Acrocorinth sanctuary of well-designed figurines spoiled by clumsy handling, such as harsh retouch (e.g., the draped female figurine H69); the use of back molds that belong to types different from the front (e.g., the votary Hi); the omission of limbs (e.g, the Aphrodite H249); or the use of unnecessarily thick walls that make one think the artisan was more accustomed to making larger-scaled terracottas (see the figurines of Workshop I, p. 346). Therefore, when we consider relations with other arts, we should think not necessarily of the craft of the coroplast but of the separate craft of the well-trained model maker, who provided the archetypes that coroplasts could use either well or poorly, depending upon their level of skill. The work of model makers, who appear to have provided workshop materials for other craftsmen as well, brought the coroplastic industry into contact with the wider world of the arts. When coroplasts were largely separate from such influence, as in the case of the Potters' Quarter workshops, their work took on a highly conservative, rather naive, folk-art quality, as in the case of Workshop A (see p. 344). Although it might naturally be assumed that the Corinthian coroplastic industry was con- nected closely with the active local terracotta sculpture workshops, in fact there is little sign of such a link. Among the figurines from the sanctuary, only the small female protome C251 shows a facial type that recalls terracotta sculpture and perhaps could have been transmitted through large-scale protomes (see p. 74). Part of the reason for the lack of connection may be that much terracotta sculpture served a public, architectural purpose, using mythological subjects that were not popular for votives. Even when subjects overlap, however, as in the case of the standing nude or seminude youths dedicated at the sanctuary in the form of both terracotta sculpture and figurines (see p. 65), there are clear differences in type and style. The reason for this must be that the coroplasts, whether or not they admired and wished to emulate the sculptures, needed actual workshop materials in the form of archetypes or molds already made from the archetypes, in order to produce the figurines. The craft of the terracotta sculptor did not produce such materials, but that of the worker in small bronzes did. 113 A few figurines preserve the crisp detail usually thought to reflect metalwork; their molds may have been taken from completed bronzes or their models. Examples of the Classical and 12 Corinth XV, ii, pp. 3-4. 1'3 On the range of workshop materials in a metalworker's atelier, see Reeder 1987, pp. 439-440. Such materials must have been the main source of inspiration for small-scale works of art in general.</page><page sequence="363">THE FIGURINES AND OTHER ARTS 343 Hellenistic periods114 are the dancer C282 (see p. 81), the mold for which may have been taken from the relief on a mirror cover; the female heads C142 (see p. 55), H235, and H237 (see p. 167); the pig VI (see p. 266); and the votive shield V18 (see p. 271), which is merely a small fragment but shows fine detail in more complete examples. Four finely detailed miniatures might also have had metallic sources: the seated girl C248 (see p. 72); the mantled dancers H165 and H166 (see p. 155); and the comic dancer H365 (see p. 196). Sometimes typological parallels for the figurines can be found among small bronzes. Both lingering Archaic standing "korai" and Early Classical peplos-figurines may have been developed either from or together with bronze mirror caryatids (see pp. 26-27); the peplos-figurine C10 (see p. 28) has features in common with a bronze of reported Corinthian provenience; small bronze bulls are so common in the archaeological record that a well-detailed terracotta example such as V5 (see p. 267) could be dependent on one; the piglet carrier HI (see p. 120) has a close parallel for its drapery arrangement in a small bronze. Some of the base types are directly copied from those used to support small bronzes (see pp. 275-276). Recent studies of the manufacture of ancient bronzes, particularly of small scale, have shown how close some of the techniques are to the preparation of terracotta figurines (see p. 14). The artisans prepared a clay model, from which master molds were taken to cast any number of secondary wax models that were used (and destroyed) in the casting process. The secondary models could be revised to produce many variants of the original model, which was preserved for reuse as needed. The bronze-worker's original model served the same function as the coroplast's archetype; the coroplast also habitually rang changes on a basic type to produce innumerable variants, what is called in this study an "iconographic series." Given the present state of the evidence, it is not difficult to propose a close relationship between workers in bronze and terracotta, but it is not clear just how the workshops were organized. A possible clue may be that the larger and better-made figurines are often known in only one or two examples. Even though the archaeological record is far from complete, multiple examples of some types are known, and one must therefore assume that some types were indeed made in more abundance than others and that relatively few copies of these better figurines were produced. Figurines that are well designed but clumsily handled could well be the work of potters or other workers in terracotta who purchased a few molds or archetypes from a model maker, but who were the skilled workers who made small numbers of large, fine figurines? Were these pieces expensive enough to make this activity worthwhile? We tend to think of terracottas as being cheap, but perhaps good quality was valued even in this medium, although the material was not precious. Or perhaps the economics of this practice can be explained by linking the production of large, well-made figurines to the same workshops in which fine models were prepared for the manufacture of bronzes; the sale of the models might have provided enough income to allow the production of a few good terracotta figurines as a secondary activity. While the making of models is technically essential to the production of bronzes, it is not to the carving of stone sculpture, and there has been much discussion of the nature of the stone sculptor's preparatory work (see p. 26). Whether the sculptors relied on drawings or small three- dimensional models, some method of recording the repertoire is presupposed by the pastiches of types reappearing in different combinations on such monuments as votive and record reliefs. When Corinthian figurines reflect knowledge of the types and styles of stone sculpture, it is more likely that the model makers knew these trends through workshop materials than by direct observation of sometimes far-flung monuments (see pp. 134-135).115 When the figurines reflect 114 The publication of Archaic figurines with this feature is forthcoming. 115 The existence of closely similar 3rd-century B.C. Rho- dian Ganymede statuettes in both terracotta and marble (Zer- voudaki 1978) points to the use of matching workshop materials by coroplasts and sculptors in stone.</page><page sequence="364">344 SUMMARIES the architectural sculpture of Olympia (see p. 26), Athens (see p. 33), Epidauros (see, e.g., pp. 80- 81), or Pergamon (see pp. 253-254), it is conceivable that artisans who participated in these projects later worked in Corinth, but the knowledge gained of these monuments still had to be recorded in some way for other artisans to use. Whatever the means of transmission, stylistic and iconographic connections, apart from the architectural sculpture mentioned above, have been noted with a number of specific works, including the Mantineia base (see p. 161), the Apollo Patroos (see p. 122), the Grimani statuettes (see pp. 132-135), the "Hygieia" from Tegea (see p. 164), the "Maussollos" from Halikarnassos (see p. 140), the portrait of Hypereides (see p. 141), and the head of Eubouleus (see p. 259). Lesser-known works include votive reliefs (see, e.g., p. 35) and female statues from Megara (see p. 254). There is no demonstrable derivation of any of the Corinthian types from a major cult statue (see pp. 134-135). Clearly the range of knowledge of sculptural iconography and styles was wide, and there was no area of particular emphasis. One should assume that workshop materials were readily available in Corinth from a wide range of sources, as one would expect in a major Greek city, and that local artisans readily made use of ideas that came to their attention, contributing to the diversity that is a hallmark of the Corinthian coroplastic industry. WORKSHOPS In the preceding chapters, it was occasionally possible to link figurines into workshop groups, using technical and stylistic idiosyncracies as criteria, keeping in mind that the nature of the coroplastic industry in Corinth encouraged workshops of short duration (see pp. 19-20). While many more figurines could be linked by mold relationships, the use of common molds, without other confirming similarities, is not in itself proof of common workshops, since collateral molds could have been used in different locations. Subsequent generations in a mold series may show variations in fabric and technique strong enough to place them in different workshops (e.g., H249 and H250).116 In this chapter, the principal workshop groupings are summarized, emphasizing those for which more than one type has been preserved, in order to reveal the interests of the artisans and their procedures. Workshops that can be recognized in only one type, for example, the heads of seated goddesses C95-C98, are not included here but can be retrieved through the index (s.v. Workshops). The Potters' Quarter workshops are listed first. POTTERS' QUARTER WORKSHOPS Workshop A (see pp. 34, 342): standing peplos-figurine C33; standing draped female aulos- player in Paris; seated goddess in Boston; standing draped female figurine with fillet and box (present whereabouts unknown). The figurines in this group are characterized by heads that are typical of articulated "dolls" and are small in relation to the torso. The small faces are topped by tall coiffures, and large headdresses not typical of "dolls" were added. The mitten-shaped hands are like those of "dolls," and the arms actually may be adapted "dolls"' arms. The narrow drapery folds are shallowly modeled. The result is rather awkward and unsophisticated. The workshop may have made primarily articulated "dolls," adapting figurines of peplophoros type from their available materials. The size range is 3. The workshop probably was active in the third quarter of the 4th century B.C., to judge from the high girding of C33. Workshop B (see pp. 30, 56): standing peplos-figurines C17 and C18; head of "doll" C152; head of female mantled figurine C150; other female heads C149 and C151. 116 On the identification of hands in workshops through idiosyncrasies of technique, see N. A. Winter 1991.</page><page sequence="365">WORKSHOPS 345 This workshop (possibly one hand?) can be identified mainly by the characteristic slashed tooling of the hair, which is constant even when the coiffure changes. The faces of C17 and C149-C152, which are all mechanically related, are triangular in shape, with downturned eyes and features clustered near the center of the face. This facial type is characteristic of some figurines and molds found in the Potters' Quarter. The head of the peplos-figurine, the mantled figurine, and the "doll" are of successive generations, suggesting that this artisan made a new mold from an existing figurine when he wanted to change the type; that is, he did not have access to the archetype, which would have allowed the scale to remain constant. Therefore, the three generations do not necessarily imply a long span of time. This workshop, like Workshop A, made "dolls" as well as standard figurines. The walls of the peplos-figurines are unusually thick for their size, perhaps to compensate for firing them together with the solid "dolls." The size range is 2 or 3. To judge from the coiffures, this workshop was probably active in the third quarter of the 4th century B.C. Workshop C (see pp. 155, 196): mantled dancers H165 and H166; comic actors as a dancer and a hydriaphoros H365 and H367. This workshop produced delicately detailed miniatures of both serious and comic types. The molds may have been derived from metallic sources. The location of the workshop is confirmed by the discovery of a miniature dancer at the Potters' Quarter. This workshop probably was active in the middle to third quarter of the 4th century B.C. WORKSHOPS OUTSIDE THE POTTERS' QUARTER Workshop D (see pp. 17-18, 25, 60): standing peplos-figurines C1-C6; horse-rider C186. The figurines from this workshop are held together by their generally good craftsmanship, their doughy vertical and zigzag folds, and their combination of Early Classical and Archaic features. The female subjects, when identifiable, are votaries carrying offerings. The thickened oval necklines of both Cl and C186 suggest the use of common workshop material in the development of both female and male types. The size range is 3 or 4, two members of the group approaching statuette scale. This workshop was active not later than the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. and possibly earlier. Workshop E (see pp. 182, 193): head of baby Eros H290; head of a girl H347; head of a child, possibly Eros H348. This workshop produced beautifully crafted and delicately detailed child and Eros figurines in size ranges 2 and 3. The output appears to have been small, and no other types can convincingly be assigned to this group. On contextual evidence and the quality of the workmanship, the workshop may have been active in the first half of the 4th century B.C. Workshop F(see pp. 158-159): female heads H180-H185. This workshop produced mostly relatively large heads (size range 3-4), rather crudely retouched, wearing the long hairstyle usually associated with votaries. Since some members of the group wear a stephane, however, the subjects perhaps included goddesses as well as votaries. One head of this group (H183) was constructed on a head with a masculine coiffure, showing that male figurines were produced by this workshop as well. H184 is smaller than the was active during the third quarter of the 4th century B.C. Workshop G (see p. 162): female heads H199, H201-H204. This workshop produced lovely heads, large in scale (size range 3-4 or 4), wearing the curl- cluster coiffure. The two heads that have drapery attached originally belonged to mantled fig- urines of different types, suggesting that the workshop had some iconographical range. Although the fabric is sometimes very good, the retouch can be clumsy. On contextual evidence, this workshop was active in the 4th century B.C.; stylistic parallels point to a date in the last quarter.</page><page sequence="366">346 SUMMARIES Workshop H(?) (see pp. 119-120, 185, 190): votaries with piglet H1 and H9; standing nude youth H299; boy with a goose H331. Because the output of votary figurines was large and their technical interrelations very complex (see p. 123), it has not been possible to divide them accurately into workshop groupings. There are, however, striking connections in workshop materials between one of the votaries and two entirely different types, a youth and a boy. Because of similarities in the head and overall pose, the youth H299 may have been constructed from workshop material related to that of the votary H1, although one is a nude male and the other, a draped female. The boy H331 may also have been developed, somewhat later, from an archetype related to the youth; it also has a spool base similar to that of the votaries. The second votary (H9) is brought into the group by virtue of its back mold, which is close to that incorrectly used for H1. The scale of the group is relatively small, at size range 2 or 2-3; the workmanship is careless, although the designs are very good. These figurines are grouped together with some hesitation, because this workshop appears to have lasted longer than most outside the Potters' Quarter. The evidence for the length of time is the discrepancy between the dates of the votary H1 and the boy H331. The votary belongs on stylistic and contextual grounds not later than the last quarter of the 4th century B.C., but on similar grounds, the boy cannot be earlier than the early 3rd century B.C. Workshop I(see pp. 137, 143, 153, 154, 173, 174, 342): standing draped females H70, H100, and H101; mantled dancers H153 and H154; Aphrodites H249 and H260. The products of this workshop are so distinctive that they may belong to a very short period of production. The figurines, at size range 3, are thick-walled, with an unusually rough interior surface. The outer surface, at least of the front, is smoothly polished, but there is little retouch, and the base, when preserved, can be sloppy. The arms ofH249 were never added. The types are mostly derivative, the impressions are dull, and detail is lacking. Contextual and stylistic evidence places the group at the end of the 4th or the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. Workshop J (see pp. 128, 129, 165): standing girl H44; head of hydriaphoros H50; female head H223. This group is characterized by its excellent hard, fine, pale fabric, used in figurines of very poor workmanship, with dull impressions and coarse retouch. The two heads have yellow paint on the hair, suggesting that they could have been gilded, even though they were not well formed. The scale range of these exhausted types is 2 or 2-3. Contextual evidence suggests a date in the second half of the 3rd century B.C. Workshop K(see pp. 149, 150): standing goddess(?) H138; Nike or dancer(?) H145; standing draped females H130, H140 (Aphrodite?), and H144. This group is characterized by its hard, occasionally slightly coarse fabric, thin walls, and the large size of most of its members (size range 3 up to 4-5). The style is sculptural, and the types probably include goddesses. H138 is from a pottery context terminating in the Hellenistic period. The possible "Rhodian Aphrodite" type H140 is unlikely to be earlier than the later 3rd century B.C., as may also be true of H130, with its steeply arched mantle roll. If a Middle Hellenistic date is assigned to this workshop, its products would fit very well with the sculpturally based renewal of the Corinthian coroplastic industry in the last quarter of the 3rd century B.C., when large figurines of good quality were once again made.</page><page sequence="367">CONCORDANCE OF INVENTORY AND CATALOGUE NUMBERS Inventory no.

discussions of the figurines on pp. 1-81, 115-201, 249-259, 265-277, 283-298, 311-316, and 321-346. The catalogues on the intervening pages have received only a limited indexing, since such subjects as attributes and costume, when significant, are also covered in the discussions, where references to specific catalogue numbers can be found. Consequently, the catalogues have been indexed only for figurine types (e.g., animals; children: Hellenistic), for names of deities, and for specific references to excavation sites in Corinth and elsewhere. The catalogue of imported figurines has been indexed only for provenience and names of deities. References to comparanda in both the discussions and the catalogues can be found in the Index of Corinth Comparanda (pp. 370-372) and the Index of Comparanda in Museums and Collections (p. 373).
