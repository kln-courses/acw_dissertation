<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEONARD TRELAWNY HOBHOUSE MORRIS GINSBERG, M.A., D.Litt. The sudden death of Professor Hobhouse on June 21, at the age of sixty-four years, at Alencon, Normandy, is a heavy loss to science and philosophy. He combined in a rare degree great powers of metaphysical speculation and synthesis with capacity for pains- taking and detailed research in many fields of empirical science. He was one of the pioneers of comparative psychology; he developed a technique of the greatest value in the handling of the vast and chaotic data of anthropology; he laid the foundations of a scientific sociology; and he has attempted a synthesis of the results of his scientific and philosophical studies on a scale which must win for him a high place among the systematic thinkers of the world. As a teacher and a social leader he inspired love and reverence by the nobility of his thought and utterance, his passion for justice, his wise and tender humanity. Members of the Philosophical Institute have special cause to mourn his loss. When the Institute was founded in 1925, it was the unanimous wish of all connected with its founda? tion that Professor Hobhouse should be its chairman; and it has been a great piece of good fortune for the Institute to have had the benefit of his ripe wisdom and extensive experience during the first five years of its life. An adequate account of Hobhouse's work would require a sub? stantial volume. Here only the barest outline can be attempted. Fortunately there is a thread of unity running through all his work, illustrating in a happy manner his own view of reason as an effort towards integration, growing in articulateness and compre- hensiveness. It begins with an epistemological inquiry into the nature of rationality, proceeds to empirical investigations into the working of mind in the organic world and in human societies, thence to ethical theory and sociology, and returns to metaphysics in a final effort at a comprehensive synthesis. Our task here will be greatly facilitated by following his own order of treatment. (a) Theory of Knowledge.1?Hobhouse's theory of knowledge is based on a principle closely similar to that which was elaborated by the idealists of the British School, namely, that the truth is the whole, and that the proof or explanation of the part is to be found in its relation to the whole. This, which may be called the organic view of rationality, is combined by Hobhouse with an evolutionary 1 Theory of Knowledge, 1896. 442</page><page sequence="2">LEONARD TRELAWNY HOBHOUSE account of the growth of mind. Human thought is regarded as an organic structure held together by the mutual support of its parts, undergoing correlated change as it develops, but maintaining a recognizable identity through modification. It will be useful to bring out the implications of this view a little more in detail. i. If knowledge is truly organic, there is a mutual connection between all its parts, and it cannot therefore rest on a body of unchanging first principles supposed to be their own guarantee. First principles, like all other elements of knowledge, depend for their ultimate validity upon mutual consilience and mutual necessi? tation in a systematic whole growing in coherence and compre- hensiveness. Felt certainty and the feeling of immediacy are psycho? logically conditioned and an insufficient criterion of truth. 2. Scientific thought is therefore not merely a deductive process, in the sense of being confined to a body of judgments rigidly deducible from first principles, supposed to be intuitively given and above criticism, or as more recent upholders of the deductive view of science would say, hypothetically assumed. Such a view makes it impossible to bring the body of science conceived as a self-consistent system of truth into relation with truth regarded as a correspondence of judgment with reality. Nor is science purely descriptive, that is confined to the analysis and synthesis of obser? vation. Rather is it a growing body of tentative generalizations, going beyond actual observation, tested by their coherence and consilience, and moving towards ever greater systematization, whereby the probability of all the connected elements, as modified by their interconnection, is progressively increased without reaching certainty. 3. If Hobhouse agrees with the idealists in stressing the point that truth is in the whole, he is more eager than they to emphasize another implication of the organic principle, namely, that the explanation of the whole is to be sought in the interrelation of the parts. This is the realistic element in Hobhouse's theory of know? ledge. Each judgment that enters into the system of knowledge must, so to speak, stand on its own legs, though it may support and be supported by other judgments. Each categorical judgment, moreover, asserts a reality independent of the act of judging or asserting. In this respect Hobhouse may be regarded as one of the founders of modern epistemological realism. He has, however, no sympathy with those forms of realism which tend to reduce the cognitive function to a minimum or regard it merely as a conational direction of the mind upon things. If he denies that esse is percipi, he denies equally that percipi is esse. If he refuses to reduce the object to a mode of knowing, he also refuses to reduce knowing to a mode of the object. In short, the reality of the self as well as of 443</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES the not-self is vindicated, and it is argued that the conception of the self is experientially valid, being built up by the same processes which go to the making of any other valid conception. From this brief sketch of the foundations of Hobhouse's episte? mology we may pass to his special studies. He is essentially a philosopher of evolution, the key to which he finds in the notion of correlation. By correlation he understands the bringing of elements into relation with one another or of all to a whole. Put in this form the notion is very abstract, but when applied to the different fields of knowledge, it becomes in Hobhouse's hands fertile and suggestive. He uses it in the first place in his theory of mental evolution, secondly in his ethical theory, and thirdly in his meta? physical view of reality. (b) Mental Evolution.1?Hobhouse's psychology has many affinities with what is now called the 'hormic' point of view. He insists, with the supporters of this view, that mind is dynamic and has causal efficacy; but he avoids the animistic tinge which is characteristic of some forms of the hormic theory. The categories with which he works are not those of body and mind, but of mechanism and teleology. Experience reveals, he argues, three types of system which he designates mechanical, organic, and teleological. A whole acts mechanically when its parts act uniformly as a result of forces immediately impinging on each of them and in a manner which is in principle indifferent to the results of their action or to the state of other parts. A whole acts organically when the operation of the parts is varied in accordance with the requirements of the whole as a self-maintaining structure. A whole acts teleologically when its acts are determined by their own tendency to produce results affecting the whole. The mechanical and teleological modes of behaviour are, in his view, irreducible to a common category, but the organic may be explained in terms of mechanism as qualified by teleological factors. In other words, the various forms of organic life may be interpreted as variations in the interplay between the principles of purposive mutuality and relative indifference or independence of parts. Body and mind are not to be conceived as two substances. The psycho-physical organism is a whole in which mechanical modes of action are qualified by teleological ones. Bearing these general considerations in mind, Hobhouse's chief con? clusions in the field of comparative psychology may perhaps be briefly put thus:? i. Conation, or action determined by its relation to the results arising from it, is shown to be probably co-extensive with animal, if not with all life. 2. A series of stages, or what might appropriately be called 1 Mind in Evolution, 1901. Third edition, 1926. 444</page><page sequence="4">LEONARD TRELAWNY HOBHOUSE conational levels, is worked out, tracing the general lines of mental evolution from the groping of unconscious effort to articulate pur? pose. The nature of these stages, which are derived from an analysis of mature experience and from observation of the varied forms of behaviour in the animal world, cannot here be traced in detail. Broadly, Hobhouse shows that the essential function of mind is correlation, that is the relating of elements of experience to one another and to the requirements of the wholes of which they form part. Mental development is a process whereby (a) the factors correlated become increasingly conscious, and (b) the scope of correlation or the extent of the sphere comprehended widens. Thus in sensori-motor action we have an adaptation of behaviour to vary? ing stimuli, and there is a correlation of co-present sense data. In instinctive behaviour there is a correlation of reflex and sensori- motor acts, by a persistent feeling tone determined by hereditary structure and guiding trains of acts towards ends of racial service. Next, with the growth of individual and social experience, correla? tion becomes more articulate, the ends of behaviour enter more and more fully into consciousness, action becomes more plastic, and experience increasingly capable of being detached from immediate conation. Finally, thought becomes the object of an interest of its own, the processes of correlation themselves are subjected to critical scrutiny,and a comprehensive survey is attempted of the fundamental ends of endeavour and of the ultimate categories of experience, with the object of relating them to the conditions of development of reality as a whole. In working out this general theory, Professor Hobhouse has given an analysis of elementary behaviour, of the processes whereby inherited capacities are moulded and modified by experience, which, in the main, seems to have been amply con? firmed by the growth of comparative psychology since his work in this field was first published. It may be remarked in passing that his notion of 'correlation' seems more plastic and more serviceable in the interpretation of mental evolution than the notion of Gestalt or configuration with which it has many affinities.1 In the field of human psychology, Professor Hobhouse has supple- mented his earlier discussion by a chapter in his Social Development, in which he deals with the general psychological conditions of group life and development, with the nature of the social impulses, the forces that make for antagonism and co-operation and the nature of social mentality. Unfortunately, this important contribution to social psychology cannot here be further discussed. (c) Ethical Theory.2?The function of mind on its cognitive side is to correlate the elements of experience leading up to a system 1 Cf. Appendix to third edition of Mind in Evolution. * The Rational Good, 1921. 445</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES of consilient judgments. When applied to the world of practice correlation is directed towards linking up the elements of endeavour into a harmonious whole or synthesis of impulse-feelings. This general conception is the basis of Hobhouse's ethics. He seeks to show that there is a rational good, a good self-consistent, interconnected and objective in the sense of being based on universal principles inherent in the system of purposes taken as a whole. By the term 'good' we mean, Hobhouse argues, at least to refer to something which appeals, which evokes a response, something that is the object of a mode of feeling or an attitude that we call generically favourable. The judgment 'this is good' asserts a har? mony between an experience and a feeling. Strictly it is the total relationship between an experience (a conation, a feeling, or a cognitive state) and a feeling that is good. We do, however, speak of any term entering into the relationship of harmony as good 'by right of membership.' A rational good would then be a harmony of experience with feeling carried consistently through the whole world of mind and its experience, and is defined as "happiness in the fulfilment of vital capacities in a world adapted to mind." Hobhouse's ethics has sometimes been described as fundamentally hedonistic. But this is, I think, misleading and based on an inade? quate appreciation of his views as to the nature of the springs of action. There can be no doubt that for him impulses are the primary thing, and that for him, as for Butler, impulses 'determine upon their objects,' and not upon the pleasures derived from their satisfaction. The idea of good is the definition of an impulse, i.e. renders articu- late and explicit the object to which an impulse is directed. The objects of impulse-feelings must not, however, be taken as consti- tuting a self-contained good. Nor must the feelings be separated from the experiences which they tone or qualify. The good is an organic whole constituted by the terms experience and feeling in a relation of harmony. This harmony is felt as pleasure, or rather as happiness. But happiness must not be separated from the kind of life in which it is sought, and Hobhouse explicitly maintains that the rational object of human action is a type of life and not a type of feeling. (d) Social Philosophy.1?The theory of harmony may appear to some purely formal and empty of content. Professor Hobhouse has shown its fertility by the success with which he has applied it to the basic problems of social organization, political and economic. In particular, the theory of harmony avoids, on the one hand, the false separation between the individual and the social which vitiates individualism, and, on the other, the tendency to merge individuality 1 Elements of Social Justice, 1922; Metaphysical Theory ofthe State, 1918. 446</page><page sequence="6">LEONARD TRELAWNY HOBHOUSE into a colourless absolute characteristic of the social philosophy of some of the idealists. The category of the common good is interpreted by him as neither the sum of individual goods, nor as another kind of good opposed to them, but as a harmony of which individual goods are interrelated elements. The theory of rights is based on this conception of the common good. For rights are claims to the conditions of harmony, that is, the conditions requisite for the harmonious fulfilment of personality in society. It follows that rights do not limit the common good from without, but rather emerge from an analysis of the constituents of the common good in the varying and complex relations between men in society. The conception of harmony is also used by Hobhouse in the definition of freedom, personal and social. There is freedom when the impulses are adapted and shaped by the requirements of life as a whole, and when the active and developing unity of the self finds expression in and through the harmonious co-operation of the impulses themselves. In his account of social freedom Hobhouse has sought to lay down the general principles of liberal legislation. The ultimate basis of liberty is that it is the condition of spiritual growth. Spiritual unity in the common good can only flourish in a spiritual medium and cannot be obtained through compulsion. Liberty in general must however be differentiated into liberties,' i.e. rights. 'The system of rights is the system of harmonized liberties." This implies compulsion, for compulsion may be necessary in the maintenance of rights. It must, however, only be used (a) when it can be shown to be so required, and (b) when its use will not endanger the very ends of social organization, namely, the harmonious growth of personality. These general ideas are applied by Hobhouse with marked success to the problem of the state control of industry, of the right of free discussion, of religious toleration and so forth. The principles of distributive and corrective justice are explained by Hobhouse on the basis of his general theory of rights as con? ditions of harmony. The fundamental principle here is that of equality, which is defined as the claim that each has to the har? monious good proportional to his qualifications for sharing in it. There must accordingly be equal satisfaction of equal functional needs, and differential treatment can only be defended on the basis of differential functional requirements. Measures preventive and curative, on the other hand, must be provided directed against misfunction and malfunction. On the basis of these general prin? ciples, Hobhouse has worked out a theory of political and economic organization marked alike by logical coherence and comprehensive- ness and by a profound and sympathetic insight into the difficulties and perplexities of actual life. 447</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES (e) Theory of Social Development.1?Sociology is conceived by Hobhouse as the study of human interrelations and interactions. It utilizes various specialisms, some of which fall within the social field, e.g. economics, while others fall outside it, e.g. biology. It, however, is not satisfied with a mere patchwork, but aims at nothing less than a synthetic account of social life and development regarded as a whole. Towards this ambitious scheme Hobhouse has made contributions of the first rank, and it is safe to say that he has laid down the general lines of investigation which sociologists will for long have to pursue if sociology is to rank as a science. It is impossible here to attempt even a summary of his achievements, and only the general lines of his methodology can be indicated. Roughly it may be said that it consists of the following steps:? i. He has worked out a social morphology, i.e. a classification of the forms of social institutions, based on the data of archaeology and history. 2. He has elaborated a method for effecting the transition from morphology to development. This consists essentially in an endeavour to correlate the various aspects of social change from the point of view of their contribution towards the general advance of the community, as measured by certain criteria. These he deduces from the general nature of development. They are efficiency in control and direction, extension in the scale of social organization, co? operation in the satisfaction of mutual needs, and freedom or scope for personal development. 3. He has put forward a hypothesis that there is a broad correla? tion between social development as thus measured and the growth of mind. To establish this he has distinguished stages of mental evolution in its various aspects. Thus on the cognitive side he distinguishes (i) an incipient phase in which the rudiments of articulate thought are still in process of formation; (ii) a second phase in which what may be called the common sense or empirical order is built up; (iii) a phase of conceptual reconstruction in which thought systems are built up largely on a dialectical basis; and (iv) a phase of experiential reconstruction in which efforts are made to relate the thought structure itself with its conditions in a developing experience. A parallel movement may be followed in the growth of human control of the environment. This moves from a stage of semi-dependence upon nature, to one in which natural materials are deliberately shaped towards human ends, thence to a stage in which the overt forces of nature are utilized in the trans? formation of natural resources both in kind and direction, and finally to a stage in which efforts are made to disentangle the rjjider- lying conditions of life and development and to utilize the knowledge 1 Social Development, 1924; Morals in Evolution, 1906; 4th edition, 1923. 448</page><page sequence="8">LEONARD TRELAWNY HOBHOUSE thus gained in an attempt consciously to direct social evolution. On the ethico-religious plane he distinguishes (i) a phase in which the spiritual is wholly confused with the material; (ii) a second phase in which the spiritual stands out as an anthropomorphic and even superhuman personality; (iii) a third phase corresponding to the stage of conceptual reconstruction in which the spiritual is interpreted as an embodiment of ethical and intellectual ideals; and (iv) a fourth in which it is regarded neither as an unconditioned creator nor as the whole of things, but as an element in reality making towards harmony. In the development of imagination he traces a movement from (i) the lowest grade of art which reflects an incoherence of ideas; (ii) a stage illustrated by early oriental art reflecting the clear-cut, concrete ideas of common sense; (iii) an idealistic or romantic phase, the imaginative expression of con? ceptual reconstruction, in which the mind moves in an order of its own creation; (iv) a phase of realism, of which the wider develop? ments are essentially modern and which corresponds to the stage of experiential reconstruction, which with a certain cool detach? ment and a critical attitude towards ideals, yet conveys a longing for what is beyond experience and knowledge. It is not suggested that these movements are precisely parallel or that their rate of progress is equal, but that, making due allow- ances for differences in conditions in different periods of time and different parts of the world, they may be taken as a general indication of the growth of mind. Hobhouse then proceeds to show that on the net result there is a broad correlation between mental advance and the growth of the social fabric. Reverting to the criteria of social advance above mentioned, he shows that in the first phase there is good evidence of the expansion of organization in scale and efficiency, but at the cost of mutuality and freedom. Government comes to be authoritarian in character, and social differentiation rests on the principle of subordination. In the higher phases this growth in efficiency and scale increases, but there is also increased subordination. With the beginning of the stage of reflection and the growth of critical thought, forms of free government arise, and, in theory at any rate, there emerge ideals of a unitary spiritual order. The embodiment of these ideals is, however, exceedingly restricted in the ancient world. In the stage of experiential reconstruction there is not only an increase in scale and efficiency, but the elements of mutuality and freedom are beginning to receive concrete embodi? ment on a world scale, and we find attempts at a genuine synthesis of personal and political freedom with moral universalism. A survey of history thus suggests that there has on the whole been correlated growth, and the hypothesis is urged that this expresses the growing powrer of mind in man. 449</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES 4. Professor Hobhouse next contends that the process of develop? ment, so far studied by him, independently of the problem of moral evaluation, may be shown to be on the whole in the direction required by his theory of the rational good. For the harmonious fulfilment of human potentialities can only be achieved by the co-operation of all mankind, resting upon free and rational con? viction and aiming at the collective control of the conditions of life, internal and external. Social and ethical development have a common end, and can be measured by the same criteria. This coincidence is not a mere dialectical trick, but is rooted in the fact that the good is the principle of organic harmony, and to the extent to which social development embodies this principle it is good. Nevertheless, social development only coincides with ethical develop? ment "as a whole and in its completeness." In actual fact develop? ment proceeds by a union of partial developments, and these may not be, and often are not, in conformity with ethical requirements. What is claimed is that on the whole a substantive advance has been made as judged by ethical criteria. In the extension of organic harmony Hobhouse finds the reality of progress. This is essentially the work of rational mind working in individual centres, but expanding in scope and articulateness, linking up partial develop? ments into wider and wider unities, and having for its final purpose the harmonious fulfilment of human potentialities on a world scale. Progress is accordingly not automatic, but depends upon human thought and will. The belief in the reality of progress rests ultimately on the fundamental rationality of mind, on the possibility of forming an intelligible, coherent conception of a good common to humanity, and of securing an effective will directed to this good. (/) Theory of Reality.1?The mind which Hobhouse takes to be the moving force in the history of civilization is not a unitary mind akin to that which we recognize in individual personalities,* but an interconnection among minds developing towards harmony. This principle of interconnection he seeks also to apply to the explanation of reality as a whole. Here again only the barest outline of his theory can be attempted. He proceeds partly by an examination of the facts of evolution, partly by an analysis of the logical requirements of explanation, when applied to a whole which is undergoing develop? ment, or rather in which there is development. A synthesis of experience shows that nature is a system which maintains itself amidst the innumerable changes of its parts, and this implies a continuous interrelation of functions. Further, evolutionary science may be said to have shown that there is continuous development, in the sense that in the processes of change finer and more articulate structural wholes appear. This is taken as evidence of an underlying 1 Development and Purpose, 1913; revised and largely rewritten, 1927. 450</page><page sequence="10">LEONARD TRELAWNY HOBHOUSE correlating activity, operating continuously with cumulative effect. Orthogenic evolution points to a nisus in nature towards ever more comprehensive and articulate synthesis, an effort towards the extension of the sphere of organization. This, it is urged, cannot be explained except on the assumption of a conational force in reality, a force that, so to speak, tries, throws out efforts, and seeks to grow and mature. This hypothesis is confirmed, Hobhouse thinks, by the logical requirements of systematic explanation. The rational ideal points to a system of interconnected judgments asserting a reality of interconnected parts. Each part must have its ground within the whole. But if everything has a ground, there can be no uncon? ditioned datum. It follows that the system must consist of elements each conditioning and conditioned by the remainder. If this notion of a system of reciprocally determining parts is applied to a changing order, it will be seen that any point that we start from as the cause of what follows must be also conditioned by what follows. This is only possible if it is determined by a tendency referent to the out? come, that is, by a tendency to bring about the resulting process. Ordered process, in other words, is a continuum in which con? ditioning is not unilateral, and this, it is urged, involves a conational or teleological element. Thus both empirical synthesis and epistemological analysis point to a view of reality in which there is operative a conational factor bringing about correlation between elements otherwise indifferent or unrelated. Reality reveals indifference and conflict, but also an increasing trend towards unity. The unity cannot be that of a mechanical system, for then we should be unable to account for the emergence of varying unitary systems in which the elements appear in varying collocations. Nor can the system be completely organic, in which case the same difficulty would apply, and we should further be unable to account for the element of indifference. We need a system of elements to some extent self-determining, and thus so far in principle indifferent to the action of other elements but also containing something in them that makes for mutual determination and growing correlation. The correlating factor is conational. It may be supposed to operate through trial and error, and later through conscious purpose. It proceeds by a series of syntheses from that which is manifested in the emergence of the structured wholes of the physical world to that of living organisms and societies of organisms. The process is, however, neither unitary nor direct. It involves continual disturbance of equilibria, and is thus a potential source of conflict. In the higher phases the process comes to some extent to be consciously directed, yet even then its problems are not thereby necessarily simplified. 451</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES The power behind development, or the correlating agency, Hobhouse calls Mind. This, though coeval with reality, is not all reality, but only an element within it, and like other elements determining and determined. It must not therefore be confused with the Unconditioned of metaphysics. Nor must the Central Mind be regarded as the systems of minds taken together. Minds in so far as they act indifferently to the action of other minds behave mechanically, in Hobhouse's sense of this term. Mind is rather a common factor in all elements of the real, that in them, namely, which makes for unity and order. Hobhouse's philosophy is thus to a certain extent pluralistic, since it supposes elements indefinitely numerous, each in a measure self-determining; yet the system is organic, for the self-assertiveness of the parts also constitutes their contribution to the whole by which they are conditioned. The principle of unity does not generate the parts, nor does it absorb them; it merely conditions them as it is conditioned by them. We thus have strictly neither a monism nor a pluralism, but a system of elements, distinct yet mutually conditioned. Hobhouse has sought to consolidate his position by painstaking and detailed study of a very wide range of fact; and he was ever ready to revise his views in the light of advancing knowledge. But behind all his work and inspiring it there lay certain direct and simple experiences of goodness and beauty to which he has given brief but moving expression in many of his writings. Upon these experiences, in the long run, rather than upon anything else, perhaps, he rested his faith in an indwelling spiritual power. 45*</page></plain_text>
