<plain_text><page sequence="1">289 DIALECTICS OF NATURE OR DIALECTICS OF PRACTICE? Angus M. Taylor In recent years western social scientists and commentators have hailed the coming of "post-industrial" society, maintaining that the old ideological debates about capitalism and socialism have been rendered sterile. The increasingly organized application of science to the productive forces of society, with its array of technical experts at all higher levels of business and government, is said to mark a historic advance in human civilization. In the east, where historic advance is viewed according to another schema, the technoc? ratic forecasts emanating from the west are spurned. Yet since 1917 Marxism, or rather Marxism-Leninism, whatever its claims and intentions, has functioned primarily as an ideology promoting rapid industrialization according to bureaucratic planning. Hence, it has had little, if anything, to do with the goals of Marx and his nineteenth-century followers such as William Morris, for whom socialism implied above all the democratiza? tion of all walks of life and the progressive liberation of the individual's creative potential. The similar trends of east and west are reflected in the use of certain common or related measures of the progress of society toward the respective goals of communism and post-industrialism. These measures in? clude organizational complexity, information content, and the development of the forces of production. And these are supported by a theoretical dialectics of nature, which grounds them in natural law. The term "dialectics of nature" is taken from Engels, but may be used in general to describe the attempt to understand human society as part of a hierarchy of natural organizations, and to derive the ideal form of human society from a consideration of this natural hierarchy. In the east dialectical materialism is official philosophy: in the west systems theory has made itself increasingly the order of the day. Although systems theory has emerged in various specific forms and in connection with a number of disciplines, I am concerned here with the attempt that has been made to elaborate a world-view from systems princi? ples ? that is, with "general systems theory" in its philosophical aspect. This world-view involves an account of the evolution of historical systems, including assertions about social formations and human values. General systems theory offers striking parallels with certain orthodoxies of dialectical materialism, and it is these parallel general scientific philosophies which I shall focus on in this paper. Both share the dialectics of nature perspective. General systems theorists have claimed to recognize the importance of man as an active, creative being; like the adherents of dialectical materialism, they have espoused humanist ideals. Yet it is problematic whether this claim can be reconciled with the dialec? tics of nature perspective which charac? terizes general systems theory, at least in Angus M. Taylor studies Political Science at the Univer? sity of Amsterdam.</page><page sequence="2">290 the form presently assigned to it. General systems theory would seem to be subject to the same sort of criticism that has been levelled against the dialectics of nature line within Marxism: that it ignores or down? plays the anthropological principle of human interaction with the world, and thus lends itself to ideological abuse. DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM AND GENERAL SYSTEMS THEORY As is well known, the concept of practice played a central role in Marx's philosophy. Marx's materialist conception of (human) history was predicated on a dialectic between man and environment, set into motion and maintained through the agency of human labor. So-called dialectical materialism, how? ever, has wider claims, being a philosophy which views human history as manifesting in its own way certain universal principles applicable to all the sciences. In this light human history is an extension of natural history, and historical materialism is a par? ticular application of the principles of dialec? tical materialism. The dialectics of nature perspective within Marxism has its origins in Engels' writings on the natural sciences and their relation to historical materialism. His two principal works in this area are Anti-D?hring (1878) and the uncompleted Dialectics of Nature, written between 1873 and 1886, but not published until 1925. Together with Lenin's writings in the subject, they subsequently formed the basis of the official Soviet view of the structure and processes of nature. In the light of the revolution in physics at the turn of the century Lenin produced Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, in which he was concerned with defending Engels' position. "Modern physics is in travail; it is giving birth to dialectical materialism," he wrote [ 1 ]. Where the breakdown of the old mechanistic conception of physical elements was leading many persons to declare that matter had "disappeared", Lenin took the new developments as further confirmation of the dialectical materialist view of nature. Other names in this project include Karl Kautsky in Germany, who was greatly influ? enced by Darwinism, and Nikolai Bukharin in Russia, whose attempt to formulate Marxism in explicitly systems terms influenced a gen? eration of party officials in the young Soviet state. As Engels saw it: The whole of nature accessible to us forms a system, an interconnected totality of bodies, and by bodies we understand here all material existences extending from stars to atoms, indeed right to ether particles, in so far as one grants the existence of the last named. In the fact that these bodies are interconnected is already included that they react on one another, and it is precisely this mutual reaction that constitutes motion. It already becomes evident here that matter is unthinkable without motion [2]. Engels claimed that Heraclitus was essen? tially correct in holding that the world exists in a state of ceaseless flux. But as formulated, this early conception was inadequate to the task of explaining the details of the whole picture. The whole as a complex of processes could only be adequately understood after nature had first been analyzed into its individ? ual parts and classifications, and this analysis was the important advance accomplished by modern science in the centuries up to the nineteenth. Yet this method of analysis was inadequate precisely because it produced the habit of observing natural objects and processes out of context, and as static rather than variable elements. The progress of natural science, however, eventually made possible the transition from "a collecting science, a science of finished things" to what was "essentially a systematising science, a science of the processes, of the origin and development of these things, and of the inter? connection which binds all these natural processes into one great whole" [3].</page><page sequence="3">Engels insisted that the movement and interconnection of nature's parts was not a dogmatic, a-priori thesis, but a hypothesis about the world which was being increasingly forced to the forefront and confirmed by scientific discoveries. What had been for the ancient Greeks only "a brilliant intuition" was now becoming established as "the result of strictly scientific research" [4]. One of the most important advances of his time Engels saw as the law of conservation of energy, which was coming to be seen more and more in terms of the transformation of energy, "in which for the first time the qual? itative content of the process comes into its own and the last vestige of an extramundane creator is obliterated." This process of trans? formation he referred to as "the great basic process, knowledge of which comprises all knowledge of nature" [5]. Thus he held that it was a mistake for natural science to direct its efforts to seeking out uniform matter as such, to reducing qualitative to quantitative differences. The materialism of the eighteenth century had been limited by the fact that it applied the standards of mechanics to pro? cesses of a chemical and organic nature, and that it did not comprehend the universe as a complex of processes, as matter undergoing continuous historical development. By affirming the self-generating character of nature while denying that science can be reduced to the search for ultimate building blocks of nature, dialectical materialism implies that there exists a hierarchy of pro? cesses, each level emerging from those below it, but possessing its own irreducible prop? erties. "The classification of sciences is nothing more than a hierarchy of the forms of motion of matter in accordance with their essential order, in other words, in accordance with their natural development and the transi? tion of one form of motion into another, as accomplished in nature" [6]. The role of philosophy, from this point of view, is to examine and compare the findings of the 291 different sciences, and to elaborate "the more general laws governing the development of nature, society and thought. . ." [7]. Similarly, a fundamental concern of general systems theory "is to derive and validate the basic principles and metaprinciples that com? monly govern physical, biological, social, ecological, and artificial systems" [8]. Sys? tems theorists reject as inadequate the anal? ysis of isolated elements in the field under examination and instead stress process and interaction. General systems theory also recognizes the unique properties of the fields studied by different sciences, but seeks prin? ciples common to the operation of systems as such. In the words of Ludwig von Bertalanffy Reality, in the modern conception, appears as a tremen? dous hierarchical order of organized entities, leading, in a superposition of many levels, from physical and chem? ical to biological and sociocultural systems. Unity of Science is granted, not by a Utopian reduction of all sciences to physics and chemistry, but by the structural uniformities of the different levels of reality [9]. It is interesting to note that at the time when von Bertalanffy, the "father" of general systems theory, was developing this approach in the late 1930s and in the 1940s, an anal? ogous line had already been established for some time as orthodox doctrine in the Soviet Union. Thus a member of the Soviet delega? tion to the International Congress of the History of Science and Technology held in London in 1931 could declare: Affirming the unity of the universe and the qualitative multiformity of its expression in different forms of motion of matter, it is necessary to renounce both simplified identification and reduction of some sciences to others, as the supporters of the mechanistic and positivist currents in the sphere of natural science strive to do, and sharp demarcation and drawing of absolute watersheds between the physical, biological and socio historical sciences... [10]. Two of the main features of general sys? tems theory are the notions of wholes and of open systems. The systems approach seeks</page><page sequence="4">292 to understand the operation of entities as wholes; it does not explain the properties of the system in terms of the properties of its elements in isolation from each other, nor does it postulate a mysterious vitalism to explain the system's behavior. The whole is constituted through the organization and dynamic interaction of its parts. Further? more, living systems are characterized by a continuous exchange of material with their environments. This openness enables them, unlike closed systems, to maintain them? selves internally in a "steady state", and even to move to states of increased organiza? tion. The importance of wholeness has been a central feature of Marxist thought, mediated, if not necessarily originating in Hegel. Indeed, as early as 1847 Marx asserted that, "The production relations of every society form a whole." He criticized the method of political economy in which "the limbs of the social system are dislocated" and which therefore could not explain "the structure of society, in which all relations co-exist simultaneously and support one another" [ 11 ]. To look upon an element only in isolation is to distort one's view, because the very nature of each is a function of its relations to the other elements in its environment. It was toward the study of these relations and the dynamic wholes they compose that Marx's dialectical method was directed [ 12]. Engels conceived of the living organism explicitly in terms of a contin? uous exchange of material with its environ? ment, and the concept of the interaction of systems with their environments can be said to be implicit in the notion of the dialectic. Speaking from a dialectical materialist standpoint in his Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford in 1937, Joseph Needham argued that living wholes in nature maintain an interior equilibrium through regulation of exchanges of energy and materials with their environments, and that evolution dis? plays a succession of levels of organization, in human societies too, in which there is an increase in the number of parts in the wholes, and an increase in the complexity of the structures and interrelations of these parts ? the result being an increasing flexibility and autonomy of the actions of these wholes with respect to their environments. In arguing for this concept of "integrative levels", Needham paid tribute to the ideas of Spencer, but maintained that Spencer had failed to follow his own argument to its logical con? clusion and to see that the next transition to a higher integrative level must be from economic individualism to the common ownership of the world's productive resources. "His grand sweep of vision from the nebulae to man truncated itself in the narrow preju? dices of the dying class to which he belonged. But it is none the less valuable to us, for we can draw the conclusions he would not, and look forward to the inevitable further onward march of the principle of progressive integra? tion and organization" [ 13]. Just as in the orthodox dialectical mate? rialist view human societies are regarded as representing those levels of organization in the natural evolutionary process at which the general laws of dialectical materialism are manifested in the more particular laws of historical materialism, so in the general sys? tems view "social natural systems" are partic? ular types of organization in an evolutionary hierarchy and display those forms of general laws of development that are appropriate to such systems. Ervin Laszlo suggests that any natural system can be regarded as the joint function of four independent variables: (1) the coactive relation of its parts, which results in the ordered wholeness of the system; (2) the ability of the system to adapt to environmental disturbances through the re-establishment of a previous steady-state ("system-cybernetics I"); (3) the ability of the system to adapt to environmental dis? turbances through reorganization, involving, most probably, an overall gain in the system's</page><page sequence="5">negentropy and information content ("sys? tem-cybernetics II"); (4) the functional structural adaptation of the system both with respect to subsystems (as a systemic whole) and to suprasystems (as a coacting part) [14]. General systems philosophy, like dialec? tical materialism, assumes the existence of a physical universe that cannot simply be equated with mental events; conversely, mental events cannot be reduced to phys? ical events. Both philosophies, on the other hand, reject a mind-matter dualism, and postulate instead that the emergence of mind in the universe can be correlated with the evolution and organization of matter. Dialec? tical materialism takes as its starting point here Lenin's concept that every material phenomenon "reflects" its environment by interacting with it and undergoing change as a result; the process of reflection reaches the most sophisticated form known to us at the level of the human mind, so that human beings display a high degree of choice in responding to their environments and can act deliberately to change the world. Like dialectical materialism, general systems philosophy asserts that there must be some considerable degree of correspondence be? tween human perception of the world and the world itself because people are able to operate in and on their environments. It is a contention of dialectical materialism that all knowledge is limited by socio-his torical conditions, but that science makes real progress over time in the understanding of the world. Similarly, von Bertalanffy spoke of the "de-anthropomorphization" of our world picture, in which what is specific of human experience is progressively elim? inated. However, human understanding of the world is never absolute. Accordance to von Bertalanffy, "ultimate reality is a unity of opposites; any statement holds from a certain viewpoint only, has only relative validity, and must be supplemented by anti 293 thetic statements from opposite points of view" [ 15]. This point was also made by Hegel, and has been stressed of course by Engels and Lenin. In light of the striking similarities between general systems theory and dialectical materi? alism, it is hardly surprising that the former has been greeted with sympathetic interest in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe [ 16]. The parallels between these two scientific philosophies are all the more striking in that they have developed independently of each other. Dialectical materialism has based itself on a more or less coherent philosophic tradi? tion and anticipating, especially in the works of Engels and Lenin, some of the fundamental developments of twentieth-century science. General systems theory, on the other hand, emerged principally as a generalization of those scientific developments ? thus contin? uing, on the basis of a much greater wealth of information, the work begun by Engels on the dialectics of nature. However, eastern European recognition of the similarities between general systems theory and dialectical materialism has not always been reciprocated. Kenneth Boulding, the economist and one of the founders of the general systems movement, explicitly opposes the modern systems view to Marxist dialectics. According to Boulding, the essence of a dia? lectical process is conflict, in which one side dominates at the expense of the other. Facism, nationalism, racism, and militarism join "Marxism" on Boulding's index of dialectical philosophies, "which have probably caused more human misery than any other error of which man's mind is capable" [ 17]. By con? trast, true social development depends on a process of slow cumulative change. In Boulding's view Marxism is not true science, but ideology. Marxism is a "prema? ture synthesis" of the social sciences; it lacks an adequate theory of organization, for which it substitutes the pseudoscientific labor theory of value. He argues that Marxist</page><page sequence="6">294 theory fails to take a holistic view; it fails to recognize that labor produces nothing unless it is organized, and that this organization depends on the whole culture of the society, with all its institutions and ideas. Boulding, himself a Christian and a pacifist, sees the same ecological principles operating among human social organizations as among plant and animal species, with development oc? curring not according to a Social Darwinist struggle-for-existence, but according to reciprocal influence and the adaptation of organizations to their environment. From this he deduces that real social progress is a result of evolution rather than revolution. Boulding's failure to understand Marxist economic theory ? that it is about the organization of labor and the reciprocal influence of productive forces and insti? tutionalized social relations ? parallels his confusion about dialectics. The core of dialectics is not to be found in the conflict of irreconcilable forces; instead, its key con? cept is the interaction and development of elements composing a whole. This is a concept that pervaded the Taoist tradition in China, and it concludes the principle of the "unity of opposites" which von Bertalanffy admired in the fifteenth-century philosophy of Nicolas ofCusa. Even where class conflict is concerned, capital and labor present a unity of opposites, each inseparable from the other within the limits of the existing social system. One of the reasons Marx and Engels attached great significance to Darwinian theory was that they saw in Darwin's ecological approach to understanding biological development a parallel with their own dialectical, holistic way of conceiving social relations. Marx quoted with approval a Russian reviewer of Capital who said: In short, economic life offers us a phenomenon anal? ogous to the history of evolution in other branches of biology . . . The old economists misunderstood the nature of economic laws when they likened them to the laws of physics and chemistry. A more thorough analysis of phenomena shows that social organisms differ among themselves as fundamentally as plants or animals. Indeed, one and the same phenomenon falls under quite different laws in consequences of the different general structure of these organisms, the variations of their individual organs, and the different conditions in which those organs func? tion [18]. So every social phenomenon must be studied according to the particular structure of the social organism which it is a part, the history and environment of the latter and so on. What is this but the dialectical method, asked Marx. The need to pay attention to structure and context is what likens the study of social rela? tions to biology. This, together with Darwin's achievement in dispensing with the need for teleological explanations and in thus lending weight to a naturalistic view of the universe, was what interested Marx and Engels in Darwinian theory. Contrary to a rather wide? spread misunderstanding, they were in no way Social Darwinists; they strongly rejected any attempt to reduce social development to a "struggle for existence". Yet ? in contrast to Boulding ? they looked upon evolution and revolution not as mutually exclusive, but as complementary processes: gradual evolu? tion within the framework of any social for? mation paves the way for the revolution that replaces that framework with a new one and permits further evolution. This raises the question of to what extent general systems theory represents an attempt to present an alternative to Marxism. In con? trast to the functionalist systems theory of Talcott Parsons and company, with its static bias, more recent systems theory has been distinguished by its attempt to encompass change. The capacity of a social system not only to maintain a steady state in the face of environmental disturbances, but also to reor? ganize itself, has been emphasized. In general, however, system reorganization is not seen as implying the emergence of a fundamentally new type of society. Rather, the idea is to account for "persistence through change",</page><page sequence="7">a perspective summed up in the term "ultra stability". A system is said to be ultrastable if it can reorganize itself to most disturbances while maintaining its "essential variables" within certain limits. While systems theorists do not seem to be very precise on what the essential variables of a social system are, Marxist theory is more definite on this point. Translated into Marxist terminology, the essential variables may be identified with the relations of production. Since the relations of production condition the character of the whole social formation, they provide the yardstick for assessing the change from one type of system to another. According to Bukharin, "Within this frame, all possible variations of 'evolutionary nature' may take place; but we may pass beyond the frame only with the aid of a revolutionary up? heaval" [ 19]. Maurice Godelier sees the developing contradiction between a society's forces and relations of production as ex? pressible cybernetically in terms of the inter? nal regulation of a system within specific limits. "The appearance of a contradiction is, in fact, the appearance of a limit to the conditions of invariance of a structure. Beyond the limit a change in structure becomes nec? essary" [20]. In the case of Marxism structure refers to something relatively invariant: the laws of composition by which the whole is formed. This is a "deep" structure, in which the laws remain constant over some period of time, even though in outward appearance the system may grow and change. Structure is not some? thing immediately observable [21 ]. By con? trast, structure in general systems terms is given by the observable relations or inter? actions among the system's elements: cells or organs in a body, people or organizations in a society. Here structural change or, rather, system reorganization has to do with the degree of organization, the number and 295 arrangement of parts in the whole. A focus on system reorganization is linked with the idea of a natural systems hierarchy, one of the foundations of general systems theory. The hierarchy is formed by the integration of systems within larger systems, which are in turn integrated within still larger systems. Thus the emergence of a "new" system does not imply the total internal transformation of an existing system ? i.e., a new set of laws of composition of the whole ? but the in? tegration of several systems at a higher organi? zational level. Systems theory, then, in its non-Marxist guise, appears as an attempt to develop a theory of the dynamics of systems (develop? ment within a given system structure), but not of diachronic change (the change from one structure to another). From the stand? point of dialectical materialism it is possible to conceive of fusing the notion of the struc? tural transformation of social systems with the concept of the natural systems hier? archy ? witness Needham's exposition of integrative levels. The general systems ap? proach, however, stresses the ability to adapt to changes in the environment, to persist in the face of change. Unlike Marxism, it does not assign any inherent limit to a social system's capacity to survive. It assumes that the system posseses a large degree of rational control over its internal organization and that response to change is mainly a matter of political decision-making. Ulti? mately, it is the natural systems hierarchy and its evolution against which the adapta? tion (or lack of adaptation) of its sub-systems must be measured. The general systems view of society thus manages to combine a belief in rational control with a tendency to assume that functioning systems have been posi? tively sanctioned by the natural order of things: they have proved their fitness to survive.</page><page sequence="8">296 THE TECHNOCRATIC CONVERGENCE OF EAST AND WEST Both Comte and Spencer described societal development in terms of a series of evolution? ary stages. But while Spencer inferred from this the inappropriateness of governmental interference and was an advocate of laissez faire, Comte saw in the fixed trajectory of human society the justification of rational governmental guidance and reform. Unlike Marx, Comte did not view the rational man? agement of society in terms of the abolition of the class system; rather, he proposed the reconciliation of capital and labor under a system of scientific management. The enor? mous appeal of Comte's technocratic ideal was not confined to the right wing of the political spectrum, but was also reflected on the left in, for example, the Fabian Society and the British Labour Party, and even in Lenin's adoption of the Taylorite system of scientific management after the October Rev? olution. Today evolutionary views provide justifica? tion for the technocratic management of society. From the systems viewpoint, an objective standard of evolution is provided by the degree of system organization. Social systems can be assessed like other natural systems, and in this case societal progress is implicitly or explicitly equated with evolu? tion. In other words, as with Spencer, prog? ress is equated with evolution from "simpler" to more "complex" forms of organization, and with the adaptation of the organization to its environment. This leads to a concern with models of world order, for a global integrated system thus represents a supreme goal of social evolution. Progress requires of existing societies not so much their in? ternal (deep-structural) transformation as their adaptation to the emerging global order, of which they become sub-systems. Unlike Spencer, the systems movement does not adhere to a laissez-faire position, but to a more Comtean notion of scientific management within the framework of its concept of societal progress. It is the equa? tion of progress not simply with complex ification but with a requisite increase of negentropy or information content that gives general systems theory its technocratic bias and links it to the thesis of "post-industrial society". According to Boulding, historical progress can be equated with the advance of know? ledge and with the increasing complexity of society that accompanies this. The growth of knowledge is one of the most persistent and significant movements in the history of man, and, one might almost say, in the history of the universe. It is perhaps stretching the word to regard the whole evolu? tionary process as essentially a process of growth of knowledge, but if we think of knowledge as a capital structure of information, that is, as an improbable arrange? ment or structure, we see that it is this increasing impro? bability of structure which characterizes the whole evolu? tionary process [22]. In Boulding's view, advanced societies are currently undergoing a transition from civi? lization to something called "postcivilization", a concept which brings to mind Daniel Bell's more fashionable term "post-industrial soci? ety", and to which it is closely related. The transition to "postcivilization" is marked above all by the application of scientific knowledge, including the science of organiza? tion, to the productive forces. From this perspective the ideological war between capitalism and socialism becomes increasingly irrelevant. According to Boulding, the main difference between the two systems lies at the level of instrumental values, not of basic values; in other words, the question is which system has the more effective means for realizing more or less common ends. Socialism, so the argument runs, is not the logical or necessary successor to capitalism, but merely an alternative path to development. Development is clearly possible under either system, but a scientific analysis of organiza</page><page sequence="9">tion should be able to show which is more effective. It is Boulding's contention that the "governed market economy" is more in tune with the ecological principles which govern social organization than is the centrally planned economy. The theory of organiza? tion favors the governed market economy over the rigidity of the Soviet-type system and the instability of ungoverned market capitalism. In any case, the proper choice among systems lies in the answers provided by science, not ideology. Indeed, it is sug? gested by both Boulding and Laszlo that socialism is probably more applicable to less developed societies, those which are just em? barking upon the arduous process of mod? ernization, than it is to advanced societies. This perspective, which sees technical efficiency as the key to contemporary social progress, is widespread in the west [23]. It fits with the theory of the "managerial revolution" (in its several forms) and with the notion of the "convergence" of advanced east- and west-bloc societies toward a com? mon form. It is exemplified in the whole post industrialism syndrome, including Walt Rostow's "stages of economic growth" and the conceptual division of the globe into a hierarchy of economic regions: advanced capitalist (First World), Soviet bloc (Second World), and underdeveloped (Third World, or even Third, Fourth, and Fifth Worlds). Marxist theory, coupled with the fact of relative technical backwardness in many areas, inhibits the so-called socialist countries from readily accepting this reductionist scheme of social development. It is recognized that theories of the post-industrialism type "proceed from technological determinism and view the development of human society through the prism of technological progress alone. They deduce the stages of social devel? opment directly from the level of develop? ment of science, technology, production and associated phenomena without consid? eration of the relations of production" [24]. 297 The Soviet position in effect turns Boulding's criticism of Marxism around and claims, mutatis mutandis, that it is the ideologues of capitalism who lack an adequate theory of social organization. But though theoretically more sensitive to the pitfall of technological determinism, the Soviet perspective remains reductionist, in the sense that overall social progress is still measured according to restricted economic criteria. Economic competition with the capitalist countries is accepted as the test of the respective merits of the two systems ? with the ultimate victory of socialism guar? anteed by its higher relations of production, which must allow a greater development of the productive forces. In other words, the in? ference to be drawn from Soviet practice is that socialist relations of production are con? sidered higher than capitalist relations of production because they allow a greater devel? opment of the productive forces, and not because they sustain a more liberated society. Within the framework of existing systems the development of the productive forces contradicts the humanist ends it is supposed to serve. Accompanied by the "scientific management" of labor from the point of view of production efficiency, the organized application of science to production in this century has worked profound changes not only in what society produces ? much of it wasteful or harmful, and catering to artificial needs ? but in the nature of the work process itself. The automation of much factory and office work has gone hand-in-hand with the formation of a technical and managerial elite on one side, and a growing mass of relatively unskilled wage-workers on the other [25]. Old craft skills have disappeared, replaced by the fragmentation of work into carefully predetermined routines spread among different categories of workers. An enormous transformation has taken place in the field of so-called "white collar" work, with the mass of clerical workers not only</page><page sequence="10">298 growing in number, but becoming more and more like factory workers in terms of both work routine and pay levels. The fastest growing occupational categories tend to be those which are labor-intensive and have not yet been subjected to high technology. Especially prominent here has been the growth of the "services" sector ? jobs like janitor, waiter, hairdresser, retail sales worker ? where pay levels are on average lower than for factory or office work. While the impact of the organized applica? tion of science to production has not been confined to capitalist countries, neither has the organization of the work process at the behest of management. Lenin was an ardent advocate of adapting to the purposes of the Soviet state the scientific management move? ment initiated by the American Frederick W. Taylor at the end of the last century. In 1976 the 25th Congress of the CPSU affirmed that the long-term objective of bringing about a steady rise in the material and cultural standards of the Soviet people "is achieved mainly through raising the efficiency of production in every possible way, through its intensifica? tion, and through rapid growth of labour productivity" [26]. In this connection, it was emphasized, special attention was to be paid to scientific planning and management efficiency. The reorganizations of the Soviet economy in the late 1950s and the 1960s were a re? sponse to certain problems of over-centraliza? tion of management [27]. Here cybernetics found a role. "Cybernetics restored faith in over-all planning by presenting clear analogies for the combination of decentralization with overriding central purposes" [28]. The hope that cybernetics (the "science of systems of control and communications in animals and machines") was a key tool for rational social planning has been followed by a veritable mania for cybernetics and systems theory, with a flood of books and articles issuing from Soviet presses. In practice this ratio nalization process seems to have meant greater decision-making powers for local managers, a more important advisory and administrative role for trade unions, and so forth. In short, here as in the west, organi? zational and systems theory has been directed toward the goal of economic efficiency within the prevailing order of social control; it has not been employed to help realize alternative values or investigate the possibilities of full democratic control of economic and social processes by the masses. In the twentieth century the detailed control of the work process from above has become a feature of almost all advanced industrial societies, which thus exhibit many similarities in the relations of people to their work and to each other. The growth of tech? nocracy is inherent in the capitalist mode of production, where the ever-increasing ratio? nalization of productive processes is dictated by the competition for profit. In the "socialist" world, meanwhile, technocracy is the result of the political decision, reinforced by consid? erations of global strategy, to outdo capital? ism at its own game. The "convergence" of east and west has thus more than a grain of truth to it. What is not certain is that this trend is inevitable, that it represents the "end of ideology" and the coming of "post-indus? trial" society or "postcivilization". On the contrary, it may well be that the modern era is witnessing the intensification of certain developments (including mechanization, rationalization, and specialization) that have been present since the beginning of the industrial age, and that are characteristic features of it [29]. In which case, what we are entering is not the "post-industrial" but the "hyper-industrial" society. In all this what is missing is ? central concern with such standards of progress as creative work, individual and collective self-determination, and an end to alienation. Of course from both sides perfunctory bows are made in this direction, and it is claimed</page><page sequence="11">that the development of the productive forces is only the means to humanist ends. But in the logic of development the economic means are divorced from the humanist ends. It is assumed that if the productive forces are raised to a sufficiently high level, the ends will be realized more or less automatically. It is not considered that the ends and the means may be intertwined, that the achieve? ment of de-alienation, self-determination, etc., may depend to a large extent on the way the productive forces are developed from the point of view of the mass of people involved in the work process (i.e., the ques? tions of democratization and workers' con? trol, craftsmanship, and so forth). One reason this is not considered is that the humanization of the productive processes would directly threaten the existing power systems of east and west, which rest on the subordination of the workers to technocratic elites. These elites claim to govern according to a scientific understanding of the social organization necessary to the development of the productive forces ? whether embodied in Marxism-Leninism or in business theory. Yet the scientific understanding upon which rest the claims of the elites is scientific only from the point of view of the reproduction of existing values and social relations. This science is ideology in Marx's sense: a rational? ization of the existing system that justifies the role of the ruling class to its members and to society at large. THE HUMANIST CRITIQUE OF THE DIALECTICS OF NATURE "There is no evidence, apart from what Engels said after Marx's death, that Marx was a dialectical materialist in Engels's sense. Engels was a metaphysician ? he felt that the knew what the nature of the universe is and what laws the universe conforms to ? and Marx was not" [30]. This assertion ? and numerous statements by other writers ex 299 pressing the same view could be cited ? re? flects a critical movement of recent years that seeks to rejuvenate Marxist philosophy in the face of the deformation it has under? gone as the ideology of east-bloc ruling elites. From a theoretical standpoint, the main thrust of this critique would seem to be directed against that conception of Marxism which grounds it in natural-scientific laws. Though Engels' intent in elaborating the dia? lectics of nature may be open to dispute, there is little doubt that this notion played a major role in the subsequent formulation of the orthodox version of dialectical materi? alism. In Marx's usage, the dialectical method always implied the study of interconnections from a human point of view: that is, the mutual relations and movements of social factors. Marx maintained a strictly anthro? pological perspective on nature, in the sense that nature was always interpreted in terms of its relation to human beings. A philosophy that conceives of the dialectic first and fore? most as a natural law independent of human existence, and proceeds to derive the laws of socio-historical development from this dia? lectic, is in this respect closer to Hegel than to Marx. For Marx the principal dialectic was that between human beings and their environ? ment ? thus the central place allotted in his philosophy to human practical activity. Labour is, first of all, a process between man and nature, a process by which man, through his own actions, mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and nature. He confronts the materials of nature as a force of nature. He sets in motion the natural forces which belong to his own body, his arms, legs, head and hands, in order to appropriate the materials of nature in a form adapted to his own needs. Through this move? ment he acts upon external nature and changes it, and in this way he simultaneously changes his own nature [31]. Critics of the approach that assigns priority to a pre-human dialectic of nature claim that Marx's philosophy has no need of such a "metaphysical" foundation. The materialist</page><page sequence="12">300 conception of history is "materialist" not in the sense of basing itself upon some particular theory of matter, or even upon the more restricted evolutionary doctrine of dialectical materialism. Rather, it is materialist in the sense that it bases itself upon this very dialectic between human beings and nature, and thus makes the "material" factors of environmental circumstances and human resources the vari? ables that set the framework for sociohistor ical development. The starting point of the materialist conception of history is not a dialectic of nature; it is the dialectic between human beings and nature. Or, to put it more precisely, it is a particular kind of dialectic within nature: a dialectic between human beings and their environment [32]. Science may discover a more general dialectic of nature, but this cannot be starting point of social theory. Such a dialectic of nature may be consistent with the human-environment dialectic, and may contribute to a unified scientific picture of the world. But this is the end, not the beginning. It is a matter of deciding which is the horse and which is the cart. The mistake in assigning priority to a dia? lectic of nature, even when new qualities are assumed to emerge at each new level of organization, lies in ignoring the practical social aspect of all science. The danger is that a philosophy with such a basis lends itself too easily to becoming the ideology of an elite claiming to justify its rule on the grounds of necessary laws of historical development. This is what occurred in the Soviet Union. As Henri Lefebvre puts it, the transformation of Marxism into a philosophy of nature was a massive exercise in diversion. "While they were holding forth about waves and corpus? cles and the 'continuous-discontinuous' objective dialectic and debating these 'freely', the crucial issues were being lost to view. What was really at stake was no longer in the forefront of people's minds, which had been led as far away as possible, into the depths of Nature and cosmological speculation" [33]. For his part, Lenin had no use for decking out historical materialism in "empty and bombastic energeticist and biological ver? biage." But he did claim that Marxist philos? ophy was "cast from a single piece of steel" in which philosophical materialism formed the "foundation" of historical materialism [34]. In subsequent Soviet theory Marx's key insight into the active character of man's relation to the world has been subordinated to the search for universal laws, with the result that human freedom is conceived of simply in terms of understanding these laws and working in harmony with them. If humans are actors, they are actors in a drama whose script is already written. Although he does not reject out of hand the possibility of a dialectic of nature, Jean Paul Sartre argues that because for human beings the material world is always encoun? tered in terms of human significance, the only true dialectical materialism is a socio historical materialism. He contends that it was legitimate for the natural sciences to reject the anthropomorphism that projects human properties onto inanimate objects, but it is not legitimate to reject anthropomorphism in the study of human beings. In particular, Sartre points to the fallacy of granting a metaphysical existence to the social group as such, and insists that the group must be understood in terms of relations among individuals. This is not to deny the reality of such groups, but to assert that "we must expect to find the support of collective objects in the concrete activity of individ? uals" [35]. He perceives in Soviet Marxism a retreat to Hegelian idealism, for it dissolves the particular in the universal; it sees human activity and the concrete lives of individuals merely as the instruments through which society develops. "The totalizing investiga? tion has given way to a Scholasticism of the totality. The heuristic principle ? 'to search for the whole in its parts' ? has become the</page><page sequence="13">terrorist practice of liquidating the partic? ularity' [36]. Sartre rejects the hypostatiza tion of the historical process ? the idea of History as an inexorable, superhuman force, which Marx and Engels themselves ridiculed at length in their early writings, but which lived on in the minds of many of their fol? lowers. Louis Althusser and his disciples reject the Hegelian concept of the whole in favor of Marx's view that any social organization is a totality comprising many determinations and relations. Yet, in sharp contrast to Sartre, they view society as "a process without a subject". Human beings are merely the "supports" of impersonal social system forces which work themselves out accord? ing to the inherent logic of the complex totality. Althusser goes so far as to charac? terize true Marxism as a "theoretical anti humanism". According to him humanism may perform a useful function as ideology, but it cannot be a basis for scientific know? ledge. Also, his emphasis on the synchronous interrelation of the elements forming the whole is so strong that he rejects the idea that a social formation can be analyzed from the point of view of its historical development. Althusser's version of Marxism has been the subject of a devastating critique by E.P. Thompson, who argues that it is nothing less than a refined intellectual expression of Stalinism [37]. Whether or not this is the case, Althusser's rejection of humanism identifies him more closely with Hegel's idealism than with Marx's historical mate? rialism. Althusser's belief that people are the supports of a process that works itself out through them differs from Marx's many assertions to the effect that " 'history' is not a person apart, using man as a means for its own particular aims; history is nothing but the activity of man pursuing his aims" [38]. Because Marx's early writings flatly contra? dict certain of his basic concepts, Althusser 301 has had to separate the mature Marx from the early Marx by an "epistemological break" ? a point at which Marx supposedly discovered the science of society and aban? doned his humanist follies. There are many who have not been convinced by this maneuver. What has perhaps won most admiration is Althusser's attempt to advance beyond a simple "base-superstructure" model of the social system to a more subtle understanding of the relative autonomy of the various spheres or levels of social life. Yet for Thompson this is simply replacing a crude clockwork mechanism with a more sophis? ticated clockwork mechanism. If the mech? anistic model is really to be overthrown, Thompson argues, then what must be recog? nized is the mediating role of human experi? ence between socio-historical structure and process. The anthropological perspective, which begins from the active involvement of human beings in the world in pursuit of their ends, assigns a central place to the notions of human self-realization and alienation. The measure of historical progress is not simply an abstract advance through various levels of socio-economic organization; more than that, it is the advance toward socially sup? ported creative activity and individual self expression for all. From this point of view socialist relations of production cannot simply be equated with arrangements in? tended to raise the level of productive forces and which it is assumed must generate a socialist society as a consequence. Socialist relations of production are those which in practice sustain a socialist society. The ideal of a future communist society is first and foremost that of "the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being ? a return accomplished consciously and embracing the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism ..." [39].</page><page sequence="14">302 "Alienation" refers to the discrepancy between the individual's actual existence and his or her potential for free creative activity and self-expression, a potential that is blocked under unfavorable historical conditions. In the words of the Polish philosopher Adam Schaff, "We call alienation a certain func? tioning of men's products in given social conditions, a functioning whose mechanism escapes the control of the individual and even of society, in such a way as to constitute a menace to their plans and even to their existence" [40]. Schaff likens the func? tioning of these products ? material and spiritual ? to the forces unleashed in the parable of the sorcerer's apprentice. The con? cept of alienation is a tool of research that can be applied not only to capitalist societies, but also to so-called socialist ones. It is there? fore not surprising that it has been taken up in recent years by some of the more inter? esting Marxist philosophers of eastern Europe. In Yugoslavia the 1960s saw a number of scholars engaged in the development of Marxist humanist philosophy. The journal Praxis provided a focus for such activity until it was forced to cease publication in 1975, shortly after the government dismissed eight philosophers connected with it from their teaching posts at the University of Belgrade. The Praxis group viewed the basic problem of philosophy as the historical human condition relative to the possibilities for radical universal emancipation. It rejected orthodox dialectical materialism as "a dogmatic and essentially conservative orientation which at best leads to a generalization and systematization of existing scientific knowledge, but does not contribute to the creation of a critical ephocal consciousness capable of directing practical social energy towards the liberation and humanization of the world" [41 ]. This is the heart of the Marxist humanist critique of orthodox dialectical materialism. A philosophy that establishes itself on the basis of universal laws rather than on the anthropological principle of mankind's inter? action with the world cannot adequately meet the needs of the struggle to humanize the world. For some theorists, it would seem, the very concept of a dialectic of nature is a Pandora's box better kept firmly shut. In this view, Engels' speculations on natural science were an illegitimate deviation from the path of Marxian social theory, and had disastrous consequences for its develop? ment; if Marxism is to be restored to its historical intention and tradition it must be purged of all connection with the natural sciences. Among members of the Yugoslav Praxis group, for example, it was argued by some that scientific knowledge is limited by its very nature: it reduces humans to objects and is unable to transcend existing conditions. Philosophy must therefore be sharply distin? guished from science, and Marxism must be understood basically as a Utopian vision inspiring revolutionary action. On the other hand, other members of the group conceived Marxism as a "critical science" centered on the dialectical relation of human beings to the world and utilizing the know? ledge provided by the various scientific dis? ciplines. "According to this view Marx had transcended pure philosophy and created an all embracing critical social theory" [42]. While adherents of this latter position may have had grave doubts about Engels' dialectics of nature, they did not reject the integration of Marxism and the sciences, but demanded rather that the position and function of the sciences be properly assessed. While the justifiable accusation has been made against Engels that he departed from Marx's anthropological perspective in much of his natural-science speculation, yet it is to be noted that for Marx knowledge about nature and knowledge about man were two sides of the same coin. Not only should natural science be divested of its "abstractly material" or "idealistic" aspect ? for it was wrong "to assume one basis for life and a</page><page sequence="15">different basis for science" ? but it had to be incorporated into the science of man. While nature could only be understood through the mediation of human activity and the human senses, at the same time the study of man had to recognize his place in nature. For Marx there was, properly conceived, but one science, relating man to nature and vice versa. "Natural science will in time incor? porate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be one science" [43]. To the extent, then, that Engels' interest in natural science developments was con? cerned not with deducing the materialist conception of history from natural science but with the important, and less dubious, task of propounding the distinct concepts of a naturalistic view of the world and a general scientific method for dealing with certain types of phenomena, his interest can be viewed as falling legitimately within Marx's framework. Alfred Schmidt, who criticizes the abuses of Marx's method in Engels' work, nevertheless recognizes that the study of the processes of the natural world is not excluded from this method: "The dialec? tical element of Marxist materialism does not consist in the denial that matter has its own laws and its own movement (or motion), but in the understanding that matter's laws of motion can only be recognized and appro? priately applied by man through the agency of mediating practice" [44]. As noted above, the materialist conception of history was not itself based upon any particular concept of matter or of the laws of nature, other than that these were con? sistent with the dialectical relation between people and their environment. From this standpoint Marx and Engels criticized both idealist and (existing) materialist views of the world because they felt that neither of these philosophic positions accorded proper recognition to the active and self-directed 303 aspect of human life. In their own view man was entirely a natural being, and nature was a self-sufficient whole within which man had developed through self-action. Asserted Marx: "Here we see how consistent naturalism or humanism is distinct from both idealism and materialism, and constitutes at the same time the unifying truth of both. We see also how only naturalism is capable of com? prehending the action of world history" [45]. The humanist, or anthropological, insight that in a vital, practical sense nature is a part of man must be complemented by the naturalistic insight that man is a part of nature ? these insights together leading to the "one science" of which Marx spoke, and in political terms to that communism which "as fully developed naturalism, equals human? ism, and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism." Traditional materialism, in the view of Marx and Engels, presented a dual character. Insofar as it taught that all knowledge is derived from experience and the world of the senses, and stressed the importance of the environment and of education in shaping man, it was closely linked with the develop? ment of socialist thought, and its influence on pioneering socialists such as Charles Fourier and Robert Owen could be discerned. How? ever, in the sciences it had tended to lose its sensuous character and become "one-sided"; despite its successes in mechanical natural science it had become, in its reductionism, "hostile to humanity" [46]. In this sense materialism was gravely defective for, as Engels put it, it "did not attack the Christian contempt for and humiliation of Man, and merely posited Nature instead of the Chris? tian God as the Absolute facing Man" [47]. And while maintaining that only a mate? rialist method could be a scientific one, Marx said, "The weaknesses of the abstract materialism of natural science, a materialism which excludes the historical process, are immediately evident from the abstract and</page><page sequence="16">304 ideological conceptions expressed by its spokesmen whenever they venture beyond the bounds of their own speciality" [48]. Historically, then, materialism has been associated with progressive politics to the extent that it has affirmed human autonomy and responsibility and the possibility of social change, and opposed the concept of a deter? mination imposed on people by transcendent or super-human powers. But traditional, or mechanical, materialism had eventually proved inadequate for supporting such human autonomy; its place in the struggle for social change was taken by the "new" or "modern" materialism, which Engels was so interested in elaborating as a naturalistic world-view con? sistent with the materialist conception of history, and which eventually solidified in the shape of Soviet dialectical materialism. In the process, however, the previous transfor? mation of mechanical materialism from pro? gressive to reactionary philosophy was paral? leled by the transformation of the new mate? rialism from a philosophic and scientific world-view consistent with a critical social theory into an ideology superseding that social theory. Naturalism overwhelmed humanism. It would seem to be a characteristic ten? dency of dominant ideologies that they attempt to entrench the prevailing social order by invoking cosmic necessity. This is the case whether we think of the mythology that supported Egyptian or Amerindian theocracies, the role of the Church in medieval Europe, the Neo-Confucian conception of nature and its justification of the bureau? cratic feudalism of medieval China, Hinduism and the caste system in India, or the Social Darwinist apologies for laissez-faire and imperialism. Today the dominant ideologies of east and west both invoke natural law. On the one side, the "objective" laws of dialec? tical materialism. On the other, moderniza? tion, stages of growth, and the coming of post-industrial society, justified by reference to the accumulation of information in ever? more-complex natural/social systems. On the one hand the struggle to expand the scope for the bureaucrats of state planning; on the other the struggle to preserve an endangered capitalist order and make the world safe for the managers of the multinationals. The fact that the respective invocations of nat? ural law sound similar is only to be expected, for both sides draw upon modern science, upon systems theory and the notion of emer? gent levels of organized complexity. The ideological function of the concept of natural law in nineteenth-century social theory has been described by Robert Young in terms of a move to identifying God with the self-acting laws of nature, a develop? ment in which biologism provided a new rationalization for the hierarchical relations among people. "Looking further," says Young, "it is worth considering whether or not the new technological revolution in our own time is merely an extension of the same historical development ? based on organic analogies but embodied in scientific manage? ment, management science, cybernetics, sys? tems analysis, operational research, and the world of computers" [49]. Although biol? ogism - the explanation of social phenomena in terms of biological qualities ? is rejected by dialectical materialism and general systems theory in favor of a hierarchy of organiza? tional levels with emergent and irreducible properties, a real understanding of those particular properties that characterize nature at the level of human society is unlikely so long as the active, dialectical relation of man to the world ? a relation that must be the presupposition of scientific knowledge ? is not stressed. The danger is that this rela? tion comes to be seen in essentially one? sided terms, with human autonomy an ab? stract concept subordinated to cosmic laws of natural and social development. The widespread call nowadays for recogni? tion of ecological constraints on industrial</page><page sequence="17">activities contains implicit or explicit demands that the productive processes serve long-term basic human needs for healthy living environ? ments rather than the short-term scramble for profit. But the ecological sword is double edged. Ecological awareness, it has been said, teaches the responsibility of the individual for sustaining and advancing the evolutionary process, both with regard to nature in general, and to society, which is a part of nature [50]. Here the invocation of natural law can shade over from the demand that nature be kept fit for humans to the demand that humans be fitted to the "natural" order. We are informed by one writer who subscribes to the position of general systems theory that modern science demonstrates not the autonomy of man in shaping his destiny, but his total dependence on external forces: While the popular interpretation of the new and expansive powers given to man by recent science has fostered a prideful feeling that the gods are dead and man is master of his own fate, with powers to do almost as he pleases, the basic scientific world view portrays the reverse. Man can fly only if he learns nature's requirements and obeys them. An analysis in terms of the total ecosystem in which man lives and moves and has his being shows (a) that the world ecosystem created man and man did not create himself, (b) that this world system sustains man and that man is utterly dependent upon such an ecosys? tem and can have no life at all if he violates the bound? ary conditions (inside as well as outside the system) which the system sets for reasonably steady states of the hierar? chical network of open systems in which man participates. Within this scientific world picture, we move beyond freedom and dignity to a traditional theological view of man's utter dependence upon, and necessary service to, the will of the transcendent power [51]. Here once again is "Nature instead of the Christian God as the Absolute facing Man" - of which Engels spoke in 1843 ? now but? tressed by twentieth-century science. The claim that "the world ecosystem created man and man did not create himself" is certainly a far cry from Marx's observation that "for the socialist man the entire so-called history of the world is nothing but the creation of man through human labour, nothing but the 305 emergence of nature for man. . ." [52]. For general systems theory it would seem that adaptation to the planetary hierarchy of natural systems is the criterion of health for the system part in general, and for human individuals and organizations in particular as parts of social systems. Laszlo admits that adaptation to a social system that suppresses the realization of man's potentials for growth is not a sign of health, and that change in the system may be called for. But what is the standard against which such change is to be evaluated? The ultimate social norms to which adaptation signifies physical and mental health (and thus correlates with optimum value), are furnished by the largest discernible systems in which the individual participates .. . Much as the norms of the functioning of every single cell in the body are furnished by the coordinate functioning of all cells constituting the body, so the norms of the functioning of any given social system are furnished by the coordinate functioning of all such systems within the global socio cultural community [53]. This concept of natural norms in which the part is subordinated to the whole and the whole is viewed ultimately in terms of the established global pattern is implicit in the perspective which assigns priority to a dialectic of nature. "The norm, ultimately, is given by the highest suprasystem: the hierarchy. It is that hierarchy which is the significant resultant of millions of years of piecemeal evolution, and not any particular individual or species" [54]. Laszlo suggests that the key ideal of a new social ethos should be "reverence for natural systems". But employing the "suprasystem" as the standard of reference is a questionable procedure. Whatever the qualifications that may be attached, this can too easily be used to excuse the subordination of individuals and peoples to imperial political designs - as in the case of an emerging U.S. or Soviet "global socio-cultural community". To take an extreme instance: what would have been the appropriate attitude, in these terms, toward</page><page sequence="18">306 the growth of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s? Should one have felt "reverence" on the basis that Nazi Germany was a "social natural system" emerging as the "global socio-cultural community" ? especially as the Nazis proclaimed their intention to do away with the alienations of mechanical civili? zation and reintegrate man with the forces of nature? Clearly, there is a serious problem here which an adequate systems view of societies must meet. The meaning of alienation, which in the Marxist humanist sense designates the transformation of the products of human labor into hostile external forces under ad? verse conditions, is now effectively reversed: human beings, the products of an evolu? tionary process, are on occasion not properly integrated with their "natural" surroundings. Individuals may be said to have freedom of action within the bounds established by the evolved "suprasystem", but there is little indication of the practical operation of this freedom. The emphasis of social systems theory is on the adaptation of systems to their environments, on "inputs" and "outputs", and the maintenance of "equilibrium". The social system is a "black box" whose deep structural design and workings are vague, and perhaps not even terribly important in an understanding of the larger evolutionary process. "Leaving aside now the intricate mechanisms which favor or impede change, and the relation to these of various types of disturbances," writes Laszlo after fleeting reference to change in the paramount value system "radiating" from the controlling level of the social hierarchy down to the level of the individual, "we pass to the decisive question concerning the general effects of change" [55]. The effects of change con? cern the increasing differentiation and adapt? ability of the system as it moves from a lower to a higher level of organization ? in princi? ple measurable in terms of information content. Von Bertalanffy recognized that general systems theory is susceptible to the total? itarian danger of conceiving the state or nation as an organism in relation to which individ? uals are mere cells. His weapon to combat this tendency was the "ultimate percept" of "man as the individual": Here the main tenet will be: Man is not only a political animal; he is, before and above all, an individual. The real values of humanity are not those which it shares with biological entities, the function of an organism or a community of animals, but those which stem from the individual mind. Human society is not a community of ants or termites, governed by inherited instinct and con? trolled by the laws of the superordinate whole; it is based upon the achievements of the individual and is doomed if the individual is made a cog in the social machine [56]. But the misuse of theory cannot be pre? vented simply by attaching an irrelevant individualist rider to a philosophy whose whole thrust has been to proclaim the im? portance of context, and in effect to argue, with Marx, that the individual is the social being, whose individuality is only made possible by the developed social whole. For the threat to individual autonomy does not reside in recognizing the essential social? ity of man, but in measuring human progress according to a restricted notion of sociality (organizational complexity, information content, productive capacity). The history of dialectical materialism illustrates only too well how a theory conceived as an instrument of liberation can be converted into one of domination when it becomes a doctrine of universal evolution divorced from its proper starting point: the dialectic between people and their circumstances. It is only by re? asserting the central position of this dialectic that science will be made to serve humanist ends. Science, as Mihailo Markovic says, must not only describe the historical situation but also evaluate it, and show which possible futures best correspond to certain basic human needs. "Thus critical scientific thought does not remain satisfied by showing how man can best adjust to the prevailing trends</page><page sequence="19">307 of a situation and to the whole social frame? work; it expresses a higher-level idea of rationality by showing how man can change the whole framework and adapt it to him? self" [57]. If an understanding of man's place in nature is to serve revolutionary humanist ends, then the dialectical perspective must above all become anthropological, which is to say that it must confront the question of the devel? opment of man as a being of creative prac? tice.
