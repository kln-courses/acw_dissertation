Frembgen So far 19 curious anthropomorphic figures from North India are known, most of them were found in the coherent area of the Ganges-Yamuna Doab and three in Haryana, Lothal, and Bihar. They belong to prehistoric copper hoards from late Harappan time, by some scholars dated 1200-1500 B.C. These very abstract figures, which were published in various articles (*), have common characteristics, namely a semicircular head directly resting on the shoulders, volute-like scrolled arms on both sides, and pointed open legs. Paul Yule distinguishes two types: Type I has thinner legs, which are extremely spread (Fig. 1). Fashioned from thick metal sheeting, these artifacts have stocky proportions and are patterned on both sides with elongated gouges or dents which usually are lengthwise oriented. Type II anthropomorphs are proportionately longer than those of type I and show a curious and distinctive thickening of the metal on the upper margin of the 'head'. In section the 'arms' are triangular, the most acute angle facing outward. The 'legs' and 'trunk' are rectangular in cross section [...] The artifacts are morphologically homogenous except for No. (Yule 1985: 52). No doubt there are variants and minor deviations from these types, but all are symmetrically depicted and show a remarkable correspondence to the above mentioned common characteristics. The unique pieces are quite heavy (type II: about 3-6 kg) and the illustrated one from Sheorajpur (type II, Fig. 2), which is exhibited in the State Museum of Lucknow, measures for example 48 cm in height and 38.5 cm in width, having a thickness of 4.5 cm and a weight of more than 4 kg (2). All the copper figures are cast in mould and afterwards mostly beaten out into the present shape. Besides obscure identifications as axes, boomerang-like weapons or multipurpose tools, most of the archaeologists have interpreted these anthropomorphic figures as religious or (*) For reading the manuscript and helpful suggestions I would like to thank Mr P.N.

(Left: from Bisauli; right: unknown provenance; scale 1:3; drawn by Petra Thalmeier after Yule 1985, pi. 11, No. 239 and Yule 1989, Fig. 10, No. 1123). ritual objects (Mode 1959: 108; Yule 1985: 105; 1993: 56; Joshi 1990: 3-4). Some equated them specifically with images of the deities Shani and Shri-vatsa (Agrawala 1984: 10; Joshi 1990: 3). I would also agree that most probably they were used as idols or generally belonged to a religious-magical sphere. But should the archaeologist be satisfied with such a vague explanation? I think that one can say more about the meaning of these anthropomorphs using cross-cultural ethnological sources. To answer archaeologically oriented questions ethnographic data have been frequently used for interpretations. When I first saw one of the figures displayed in the State Museum of Lucknow, I was convinced that they must have something to do with the famous heraldic woman or Baubo-motif found in many cultures throughout the world. In the following I would like to present this hypothesis. As characteristics of the heraldic woman Douglas Fraser mentions the display of a female figure, symmetrically depicted, holding her knees apart and exposing the genital area (1966: 36-37). Earliest examples of such anthropomorphs identified with mother goddesses and goddesses of fertility and birth are known from Chatal H?y?k in Anatolia (7th millennium B.C.) and later from bronze age Luristan (1000-600 B.C.) (ibid.: 37-41; Eibl-Eibesfeldt &amp; Siitterlin 1992: 194). In his pioneering study on the worldwide diffusion of this motif Fraser also has found it in the ethnography of West Africa, Oceania (especially the art of New Guinea's Fig. 2 - Anthropomorphic figure of Type II from Sheorajpur. (Inv. No. 0.37a, State Museum of Lucknow). 178 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Sepik river area and the bei tiki worn by Maori warriors are mentioned), Indonesia, and China as well as among the Northwest Coast Indians and in the Pre-Columbian art of South- and Meso-America (1966: 43-97). One of the distinguishing marks which Fraser attributes to the heraldic woman-complex is the symmetrical flanking by other beings, an element found in Ancient Near East since about 1000 B.C. (ibid.: 36, 46, 79; cf. Eibl-Eibesfeldt &amp; S?tterlin 1992: 211). The last mentioned characteristic is obviously missing in the copper age North Indian figures not only because these are older, but because they are solitary pieces cast in moulds, thereby shaped like silhouettes. So they are not part of relief scenes or set in architectural contexts like corresponding ethnographic objects. In my opinion the very stylized form of our figures clearly reveal the active and provocative aspect of female sexuality in the position of the arms and legs. The scrolled position of the arms resembles several cases quoted by Fraser, so for example the depiction of a mother goddess shown on a Luristan bronze pin and the one on a Maori lintel (Fraser 1966: 37-38, 53). The volute-like arms indicate a relation to the familiar posture of putting the hands on one's hips, both expressions of threat, anger, and provocation. On the other hand these volutes could probably also be interpreted as clenched fists (?, cf. Fig. 1 right) (3). Female body behaviour is reflected by the presentation of spread-out legs, allowing thus view of the genitalia. Today such an exhibitionistic posture can still be seen in Western culture with models showing erotic underwear. Of course this gesture is not directly comparable to the famous representations of the Baubo-motif found throughout the world, where a female openly points to her pudenda or touches them. In their extensive study Irenaus Eibl-Eibesfeldt and Christa S?tterlin compile many archaeological, historical, and ethnographic examples of female figures showing this behaviour (Eibl-Eibesfeldt &amp; S?tterlin 1992: 181-255, esp. 185, 194). Their material clearly supports my arguments. Maybe one could even speculate if the very stylized carpet ornament, called eli belinde by the Anatolian Y?r?k and widespread among Turkic peoples, is a survival of this motif. Interestingly Karl Wutt brought home a drawing with a similar depiction from his anthropological fieldwork among the Kalasha (Hindukush/Pakistan), i.e. at the Northwestern periphery of the subcontinent (Fig. 3) (4). It shows a male standing with widespread legs and semicircular arms, having the hands near the penis. The 18 year old Arnim who made this drawing in 1989, explained it as a masturbating man. An objection which could be raised against the identification of the North Indian anthropomorphs with Baubo-like fertility figures concerns the fact that their sex (vulva, breasts) is not clearly indicated. Concerning this aspect Fraser writes: The displayed female is not an image of the genitalia alone. Perhaps the importance of this theme lies also in the femininity of the figure, for the inventors of the image apparently sought to capitalize on the inherent fascination an exposed woman has for the male (and if Murray is right, for the female observer as well). (1966: 80). (3) Compare especially an anthropomorph of unknown provenance published in Yule 1989: 241 (fig. 10, No. 1123).

Fig. 4 - Devotional object from the shrine of Hazrat Shah Daula in Gujrat (Punjab). More important than a fascinating effect I think is the obvious menacing, warrior-like appearance of the North Ipdian anthropomorphs. By the way this applies as well to birth as an ultimate fact. So they resemble most likely West African guardian figures which document an Aggressive line, with hands put on their hips, a threatening face, and accentuated shoulders (Eibl-Eibesfeldt &amp; S?tterlin 1992: 219, 228-29). Strong shoulders are a characteristic of our copper age figures, too. The typical semicircular head, set deep between the raised shoulders, cannot be explained only by technical reasons. As the figures were cast in moulds, also other forms of heads would have been possible to create. The case of the recent anthropomorphic figure shown in Fig. 4 is probably different (5). As it consists of thin silver sheet and as it was cut with scissors this form of a semicircular head requires less skills than a natural one showing a neck and more detailed features. Nevertheless, I observe a striking similarity in the form of the head and shoulders with the copper age anthropomorphs, even if the position of arms and legs are different (but they might have been altered in later time). These figures are still sold as devotional objects at (5) Inv. No. 93-317 107 (coll. J. Frembgen / Staatl. Museum f?r V?lkerkunde M?nchen). 180 [4]</page><page sequence="5">the shrine of the Muslim saint Hazrat Shah Daula (1581-1676) in the town of Gujrat (Punjab/Pakistan), varying in height between a few centimeters and 23.5 cm (the present example). Women dedicate these figures, thought to be representations of males, to the saint after the fulfilment of their wish for the birth of a son. As Shah Daula is especially known as a bestower of female fertility, it seems not quite impossible to assume the existence of an older fertility cult, which was modified in Islamic time. Coming back to the characteristic head form of the copper age figures, I would like to emphasize the possibility that also long and loose hairs (of a female) could have been depicted. In any case the head looks as if in a lowered position, thereby intensifying the menacing, aggressive appearance of these anthropomorphs. A further piece of evidence for the identification of the anthropomorphs with female fertility figures can be found in the horizontal incision mark of a fish (matsya) on one of the Sheorajpur artifacts (Fig. 2). Concerning this very common symbol of fertility, already known from Harappan pottery, R.C. Agrawala has drawn attention to the fact that fish was associated with goddess Laksmi in ancient Indian art and literature. Not only this, fish was equally an important motif in the ancient art of Iran. Later on fish came to be associated with goddess Varahi as well, specially during the 8th-10th centuries and with Camunda during the mediaeval period under Tantric impact. (1984: 9). To sum up the hypothesis, one can say that ? in the light of comparative ethnographical and ethological data ? the North Indian copper age anthropomorphs most probably represent female fertility figures of a specific dominant and provocative type. Yet archaeologists do not know the context in which these objects might have been used. Taking into account their inherent characteristics, they could have served as apotropaic symbols in front of a sacred area or as idols in a fertility cult. After Christ many nude or semi-nude female figures of Shameless women' can be found in Indian iconography, but they are usually of the more common, pudenda oriented Baubo-type in the intercourse/birth pose or represent mother goddesses (in terracotta or stone) (Sankalia 1960; cf. Bolon 1992; Eibl-Eibesfeldt &amp; S?tterlin 1992: 185, 191-93). REFERENCES Agrawala, R.C. (1984) A Unique Copper Anthropomorph from Sheorajpur, Kanpur.
