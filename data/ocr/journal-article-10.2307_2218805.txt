<plain_text><page sequence="1">63 PHILO'S CONFESSION BY W. A. PARENT Many commentators and critics of Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religionl think that Philo's confession in Part XII is manifestly inconsistent with the ideas he advances and the arguments he defends in Parts I-XI. For example, James Noxon asserts that Philo completely reverses himself at the end of the Dialogues.2 T. E. Jessop shares this view: he charges Philo with undergoing a "startling, unexplained change of heart" in his confession.3 Similarly, N. Kemp Smith avers that Philo's argument at the end of the Dialogues takes on a very strange and indeed bewildering turn.4 And B. M. Laing speaks of "the obvious absurdity, in [Philo's] confessing to a belief in what he had been all along opposing".5 Among these critics at least one, Noxon, regards this incongruity as decisive grounds for refusing to identify Philo as Hume's spokesman in the Dialogues. In what follows I shall attempt to show that this common attack on Philo's credibility is mistaken. It will be my contention that, far from contradicting himself or betraying any serious inconsistency in Part XII, Philo carefully lays the groundwork for nearly all of his concluding argu- ments in earlier discussions with Demea and Cleanthes. A perceptive reader, then, should find nothing shocking about the "unfeigned sentiments" to which Philo gives expression as the discussion concludes. Nor can he cite them as reasons for doubting whether Philo speaks for Hume. I Part XII begins with Philo's admission that he is less cautious on the subject of natural religion than on any other, for two reasons: no one of common sense would be corrupted by his disputatious spirit; and no one who perceives him as a man of common sense would ever mistake his true intention, which is not to question God's existence but to stimulate others into assessing what this existence means. Philo then adds: You, in particular, Cleanthes, with whom I live in unreserved inti- macy; you are sensible, that, notwithstanding the freedom of my conversation, and my love of singular arguments, no one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays more profound 1All page-references are to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (ed.

PARENT adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself to reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature. A purpose, an intention, a design strikes everywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker; and no man can be so hardened in absurd systems, as at all times to reject it (p. 214). Continuing in this same vein, Philo declares that all the sciences, with their maxims of the uniformity and simplicity, yet astonishing intricacy, of nature lead one almost insensibly to acknowledge a first intelligent author (p. 214). Finally, after recounting the discoveries of Galen pertaining to the prodigious artifice displayed in the structure of the human organism, Philo asks rhetor- ically: "To what pitch of pertinacious obstinacy must a philosopher in this age have attained, who can now doubt of a supreme intelligence?" (p. 215). Now should we be surprised by Philo's confession of belief? Let us con- sider first the thesis that the evident purpose and design in the universe bespeaks an intelligent first cause-call it D. Nowhere in Parts I-XI does Philo challenge D. Indeed, he explicitly avows the beauty of final causes operative throughout nature in Part X (p. 202), and in Part VII he character- izes the inference ascribing the origin of this extraordinary phenomenon to design or intelligence as both natural and irrefragable (p. 180). It is im- portant to note in this regard than when Cleanthes states D for the second time (III, pp. 154-5) and concludes by asking "To what degree of blind dogmatism must one have attained, to reject such natural and convincing arguments?", Philo is reported to be embarrassed and confounded. And well he should be, for the truth of D is indeed evident to him, his numerous cavils notwithstanding. What Philo does challenge throughout the Dialogues is Cleanthes' effort to establish by analogical reasoning a likeness between the first intelligent Being, or God, and man. To this end he repeatedly empha- sizes the enormous disparity between works of nature and human artefacts (e.g., II, pp. 144-5; V, pp. 165-7). Similarly, when Philo says in his confession that the discoveries of eighteenth century science strengthen the true theist's case, he is neither abandoning nor revising any of his earlier views. In fact, he is merely re- iterating one of the more important ideas he had already adumbrated but not thoroughly developed: namely, that anatomical and astronomical re- search makes man more keenly aware of nature's magnificence and in so doing intensifies both his feeling of respect for its author and his sense of mystery upon being confronted with what is so completely beyond his limited powers to explain (cf. V, pp. 165-6; and his discussion of evil in X, especially p. 193). From the very beginning of the Dialogues Philo contrasts the truly pious attitude of the genuine theist with the arrogant, presumptuous mentality characteristic of the dogmatists and anthropomorphites. The former is grounded on an informed awareness of science combined with an appreciation of the weakness and narrow limits of human reason, the latter on a failure either to recognize or to take seriously modern scientific advances</page><page sequence="3">PHILO'S CONFESSION 65 combined with the mistaken belief that nothing is too difficult for human reason (cf. I, pp. 130-2; II, p. 149). That Philo does speak of God as a divine Being and supreme intelligence in his confession is perfectly consistent with the language he uses and the arguments he deploys earlier. In Part V, for instance, he criticizes Cleanthes' experimental theism because it does not allow one to ascribe infinity and perfection to the first cause of all (pp. 166-7). Later, in Part X, Philo refers to the divine attributes as infinitely perfect but incomprehensible (p. 199). The question arises, how can Philo possibly justify this way of talking, particularly in view of his adherence to the epistemological principle that all our ideas derive from and can reach no further than our experience (II, pp. 142-3)? The only plausible answer is that, in imputing divinity and infinite wisdom, power, and goodness to God, Philo is giving expression to his sense of piety. Critics who find this position out of character for Philo should be reminded that very early in the Dialogues he expressly declares: "Nothing exists without a cause; and the original cause of this universe (what- ever it be) we call God, and piously ascribe to him every species of perfec- tion" (II, p. 142). II So much, then, for the first portion of Philo's confession. As we might expect, Cleanthes responds to it by repeating the major premise of D: the comparison of the universe to a machine of human contrivance is natural and obvious. Philo agrees, but unlike Cleanthes is not content to rest the issue here. Instead, he urges his friend not to ignore or overlook the con- siderable difference between nature's works and man's, differences which should lead the just reasoner to assign a much higher degree of intelligence and power to the supreme cause than any we have observed in mankind (p. 217). To the question whether the analogy between the supreme cause and human reason is sufficiently strong to justify calling him a mind or intelligence, Philo responds: this is a mere verbal controversy which, like so many other disputes concerning the degrees of a quality, does not admit of any precise meaning nor consequently of any definitive resolution (p. 217). The theism debate, in so far as it involves the problem of what God is actually like, or what properties belong to him, cannot yield substantial results. To support his claim Philo first argues that any truly pious theist will acknowledge an immeasurable difference between the human and divine mind -call this step T. Next Philo argues that even the most dedicated atheist cannot deny that all natural operations, from the rotting of a turnip and animal birth to the structure of human thought, are analogous to one an- other; therefore he must agree that the principle which first arranged and still maintains order in the universe probably bears some analogy, however remote, to other natural operations, including human thought-call this second argument A, and its conclusion P. The theist, then, admits that the original intelligence is very different from human reason, while the atheist</page><page sequence="4">66 W. A. PARENT admits that the original principle of order is somewhat similar to it. So where, Philo asks triumphantly, is the subject of their dispute (p. 218)? At the conclusion of the Dialogues Philo urges us to accept P in the full realiza- tion that it is ambiguous, cannot be given a more particular explanation, cannot afford any inference having practical significance, and cannot be ex- tended, with any probability, to qualities of the mind other than intelligence (p. 227). Cleanthes does not seem particularly surprised that Philo should adopt this position, nor should he be; for Philo has carefully laid the groundwork for both T and A in Parts I-XI. Consider first T. Philo all along criticizes Cleanthes for trying to arrive at a concrete conception of the divine nature through experimental reasoning. He believes such an endeavour is both futile and blasphemous. Thus in Part II, after listening to Cleanthes defend D without taking care to assess its actual informative significance (which, according to Philo, is reducible to P), Philo exclaims to Demea: "I was from the beginning scandalized, I must own, with this resemblance, which is asserted, between the Deity and human creatures; and must conceive it to imply such a degradation of the supreme Being, as no sound theist could endure" (p. 146; see also I, p. 131). Philo sets forth additional arguments against anthropomorphism in Part IV, where he contends that if the material world is the effect of a mind like man's, then we are still obliged to find the cause of this cause, and so on ad infinitum (pp. 160-1); in Part V, where he points out that the discoveries of eighteenth century science weaken the analogical reasoning upon which Cleanthes relies (pp. 165-6); in Parts VI- VIII, where he shows that countless systems of cosmogony can be "estab- lished" by analogical arguments; and in Parts X and XI, where after enumer- ating instances of evil and suffering he asks Cleanthes to explain how God's benevolence and mercy can reasonably be likened to our own (p. 198).6 As regards A, Philo first asserts that seemingly diverse natural processes are really similar to each other near the end of Part IV. Replying to Clean- thes' suggestion that the material world must have been produced by mental processes like those constitutive of human thought, Philo declares: experience ". . finds them [material and mental events] to be governed by similar principles, and to depend upon an equal variety of causes in their operations" (p. 161). Philo's belief that the closest sympathy pervades the system of nature (cf. VI, p. 171) is reaffirmed at the outset of Part VII. Demea asks him to anatomize the delicate internal structure underlying generation and vegetation. Philo responds that he cannot do so, but neither can Cleanthes explain the inner machinery of reason. These words, 'generation', 'vegeta- tion', 'reason', and 'instinct', denote specific natural powers or energies 6Nelson Pike suggests that the central issue in Parts X and XI is the existence of God. See his "Hume on Evil", in PR, 72 (1963), pp. 190, 192. But Philo never questions whether God exists. His sole concern throughout the Dialogues is with the nature of the divine Being, and the conclusion he draws from the recalcitrant datum of human evil and suffering is that God's attributes are incomprehensible.</page><page sequence="5">PHILO'S CONFESSION 67 which are similar to each other and are the causes of similar effects, but whose essence is beyond our ken (p. 178). A final word is in order about P. Philo's defence of this proposition is entirely consistent with his professed scepticism concerning the limits of human knowledge (cf, I, p. 134, and II, p. 149). It is also consistent with his earlier contention that because we have no data to establish a system of cosmogony, "total suspense of judgement is here our only reasonable recourse" (VII, pp. 186-7). P, after all, does not purport to furnish the correct explanation of natural order by reference to one specific principle, as do the theories briefly sketched and then rejected by Philo in Parts VI- VIII. Rather it merely says that the cause or causes of this order may be remotely analogous to reason, generation, vegetation, or some other natural process unknown to us capable of producing at least the appearance of design. III Philo's views on popular or vulgar religion-i.e., religion as found and practised throughout most of the world-are the last of the unfeigned senti- ments to which he gives expression in Part XII. He argues that in the past such religion has led to factions, civil wars, persecutions, oppression, and slavery (p. 220). Furthermore, its doctrine of a future state only serves to beget a narrow, contracted selfishness (p. 222) while the frivolous observances, rapturous ecstasies, and bigoted credulity by which its followers try to address God considerably weaken their attachment to the natural motives of human- ity and justice (p. 222); and are, in any event, absurd, for they presuppose that God has human passions, including one of the lowest, a restless appetite for applause (p. 226). Also Philo thinks vulgar religion encourages artificiality (p. 222) and fosters depression (p. 226). Nothing Philo says in Parts I-XI should lead us to be surprised by these criticisms. He never speaks approvingly of popular religions, and the episte- mological principles which govern his thinking-e.g., that all ideas reach no farther than experience and that all reasonings about matters of fact rest on the supposition that similar effects prove similar causes and similar causes similar effects (II, p. 147)-would hardly be those endorsed by relig- ious enthusiasts, whose practices presuppose a determinate conception of God. One might object that at the very beginning of the Dialogues Philo does remark on the importance of seasoning children's minds with piety (I, p. 131). Yes, but Philo's conception of piety, involving as it does a sense of reverence and awe at the incomprehensible source of nature's artifice, is not inextricably bound up with vulgar religion. One can, and Philo does, subscribe to it and at the same time denounce common religious rites and ceremonies. To sum up, we have seen that there is absolutely no ground for finding Philo's position in Part XII surprising or essentially at odds with what he says earlier. On the contrary, one can plausibly argue that Philo cautiously and</page><page sequence="6">68 W. A. PARENT skilfully builds the groundwork for his confession from the very beginning. Hence we cannot appeal to Philo's sudden turnabout as a reason for declining to identify him as Hume's mouthpiece. More importantly, perhaps, we can now begin to appreciate the logical richness and complexity of a work Hume himself greatly valued.7 University of Santa Clara, California 7As N. Kemp Smith points out in his introduction to the Dialogues (pp. 88-92), the elaborate, carefully conceived plans Hume made for the publication of the work testify to the importance he attached to it.</page></plain_text>
