<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ART UNDER THE SIEGE KAMAL BOULLATA While living under conditions of ghettoization and military assault, Palestinian artists continue to be driven to express themselves in paint, photography, and other visual media. This article examines the work of six of the ten finalists in the September 2002 biennial competition for the Ramallah-based A. M. Qattan Foundation’s Young Artists of the Year Award. After briefly surveying the conditions that have marked post-1948 Palestinian art, the author finds the will to create under extreme conditions to be an illustration of Palestinian self-assertion and faith in life. HOWDOES ONE CREATE ART under the threat of sudden death and the unpredictabil- ity of invasion and siege? More specifically, how do Palestinian artists articulate their awareness of space when their homeland’s physical space is being dimin- ished daily by barriers and electronic walls and when their own homes could at any moment be occupied by soldiers or even blown out of existence? In what way can an artist engage with the homeland’s landscape when ancient orange and olive groves are being systematically destroyed? When the grief of bereaved families is reduced by the mass media to an abstraction transmitted at lightning speed to a TV screen, what language can a visual artist use to express such grief? These are questions that come to mind when one ponders the ongoing artistic production in the occupied Palestinian territories and the art exhibits that continue to draw crowds in Ramallah even as tanks remain stationed at the entrances of the city and ring the ruined compound of the Palestinian Authority (PA).1 This essay, however, will focus on one particular exhibition that was held in Ramallah in autumn 2002, just months after Israel’s ironically named “Opera- tion Defensive Shield” had laid siege to towns and refugee camps and wreaked almost unimaginable destruction throughout the West Bank. The end of the operation did not signal a lifting of the siege: Israel Defense Forces (IDF) con- tinued to encircle Ramallah as well as all other West Bank towns, and the most stringent closures remained in force throughout the territory. Less than a week before the exhibition opened, the IDF carried out a full-fledged assault on the PA compound just blocks from the exhibition space, blowing up six buildings, KAMAL BOULLATA, an artist whose works are held in numerous public collections, includ- ing those of the Arab World Institute in Paris, the World Bank, the New York Public Library, and the British Museum, has written extensively on art.

Even af- ter the Israeli forceswithdrew to the edge of the town, the population remained under curfew. It was in such conditions that the second biennial competition for the Young Artist of the Year Award, sponsored by the A. M. Qattan Foundation, opened on 28 September 2002. The inauguration of the exhibit, which showed the works of ten young Palestinian finalists in the competition, took place on a day when the curfew had been lifted to allow the inhabitants to reprovision themselves, and the awards ceremonywas interrupted by IDF gunfire a few hundredmeters away. Commenting later on the circumstances, one of the six-member jury that judged the competition, the Cuban critic and art curator Gerardo Mosquera, noted, “In situations like this, you need more art. . . . I have always believed that art is not a luxury which you create when you have everything else, but a necessary means of survival.”2 The fact that the exhibition took place at all, and that the artists had had to brave innumerable military checkpoints and roadblocks to get there, gives resonance to the statement. VISUAL ARTS IN THE PALESTINIAN GHETTO Before discussing the 2002 A. M. Qattan Foundation’s Biennial Exhibition and the works of the young artists selected as finalists, it is useful to look briefly at the setting in which an earlier generation of Palestinian artists emerged from the cultural ghetto created by the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The works of the young artists in the exhibit were all created in 2002— that is to say, under siege in a land segmented into ghettos by checkpoints and barriers—and it bears reminding that conditions of siege and ghettoization are not new to Palestinian art.3 With the destruction and dispersal of Palestinian Arab society in 1948, Palestinian art, which had thrived for over a century, lost its cultural center. Displaced artists had to restart their lives in the parts of the country that did not fall to Israel, in neighboring Arab countries or abroad.4 Those who remained in what became Israel were abruptly cut off from the Arabworld and lived literally in a state of siege until military rule, applied to Arabs only, was lifted in 1966. The following year, with Israel’s conquest of the remainder of historic Palestine, the Palestinians of the newly occupied landswere likewise cut off from the Arab hinterland. As with their brethren living within the Green Line, the cultural connections that once flowed between local intellectuals and their counter- parts in neighboring countries were now severed, and they lost access to the publications that used to keep them abreast of Arab cultural currents. At the same time, strict military censorship was imposed on the press of the occupied Palestinian areas, and academic and cultural programs had to be approved by the occupying authorities. Within months, the West Bank and Gaza Strip were transformed into besieged ghettos virtually isolated from the outside world. Living under siege gave rise not only to civil disobedience and armed re- sistance, but also to a new breed of Palestinian visual artist whose creative </page> <page sequence="3"> 72 JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES sensibilities had been forged in the harsh realities of their lives in their ghetto. These emerging artists, who were mostly self-taught, joined hands with the few artists who had had some formal art training at home or abroad to form the League of Palestinian Artists in 1973. Through the league, Palestinian artists were able to obtain the occupation authorities’ permission to mount group ex- hibitions. Since there were no appropriate professional institutions or gallery spaces available in the territories, the artists displayed their art—mostly picto- rial works with a political message rendered in figurative language—in schools, town halls, union offices, and public libraries. Initially, the military authorities monitoring Palestinian cultural events did not assign any importance to what they regarded as marginal activities. The Palestinian public, on the other hand, suffering from Gradually, exhibitions both repression and defeat, regarded each artistic work became rallying events that that came to light under the grim Israeli presence as a the occupation authorities source of national pride and self-reassurance.

Strict censorship of all art exhibitions fol- resistance. lowed, and even those that received permits from the military authorities were prone to have their openings raided by soldiers, the exhibition space closed down, and the crowd dispersed. Sometimes, paintings displaying the forbidden colors of the Palestinian flag would be confiscated; other times artists were taken away for interrogation or even sentenced to prison. The artists themselves, however, took it as a badge of honor to be treated as harshly as writers and considered it a sign of visual expression’s new importance in a society where the oral arts, especially poetry, were traditionally valued over visual arts.Within two decades, exhibitions of art produced under occupation began to be mounted abroad under the sponsor- ship of Arab and international organizations supporting the Palestinian cause, which conferred additional legitimacy. The 1990s ushered in a new era in the visual arts. With peace talks that seemed to hold out new promise for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, the cultural scene was infused with a new energy. For the first time since 1967, proper exhibition space was provided by new institu- tions devoted to the promotion of the visual arts. Two such institutions were established in East Jerusalem in 1992. The al-Wasiti Art Center was founded by Palestinian artists who two decades earlier had been founding members of the League of Palestinian Artists. Headed by artist Sliman Mansur, the center sponsored solo and group exhibitions by local artists. It also offered art courses to young people and began to develop a photographic archive documenting locally produced art. The Anadiel Gallery opened the same year. Founded by independent art curator Jack Persekian, the gallery exhibited local artists but was especially important for opening a window on the outside world through its program hosting Palestinian artists living abroad, some of whom, like the </page> <page sequence="4"> ART UNDER THE SIEGE 73 internationally renowned Mona Hatoum, had never been to their country of origin before. Several years later, in 1997, Persekian went on to found another institution in the Old City, al-Ma‘mal Foundation for Contemporary Art, which sought to expand the international scope first introduced by Anadiel Gallery and became a major promoter of greater appreciation of experimentation in art. Though its exhibition space was limited, the foundation came to act as a cultural bridge between local artists and the outside world through its exhibi- tions of international as well as local artists, its art residency program, and its bilingual (Arabic and English) periodical publications. Meanwhile, Ramallah had begun to grow as a cultural center after the PA, established in 1994, moved its West Bank headquarters there. At the same time, with foreign donors wanting to contribute to “state building” projects, subsidies and funding for cultural projects became available from NGO sources and international foundations. Two years after the PA’s arrival in Ramallah, the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center was established in a restored local mansion and soon became the leading cultural institution in the fast-growing town. Directed by Adila Laidi, the center began to sponsor a wide range of innovative and rigorous cultural programs in various fields, including the visual arts; some of these were “exported” during these years to cultural centers opening in other towns of the Palestinian territories. The center also regularly hosts art exhibits, concerts, literary events, film screenings, and lectures. A number of other cultural institutions opened in Ramallah during those years, but the most important by far was the A. M. Qattan Foundation, estab- lished in Ramallah in 1998. Entirely funded by a family endowment, this truly national institution makes its impact felt through its financial support for other cultural institutions and programs throughout Palestine as well as its ownwide- ranging programs in the cultural, scientific, and educational sectors; the visual arts is only one of its areas of interest. In addition to its institutional grants, it also offers generous awards and grants to individuals to promote excellence in various fields.5 The Young Artist of the Year Award, which gave rise to the Biennial Exhibition that is the main focus of this article, is just one of these grants. THE NEW GENERATION OF PALESTINIAN ARTISTS Probably no venue could offer a better vantage point for surveying the emer- gence of new talents among Palestinian artists and the range of artwork being produced than the Qattan Foundation’s Biennial Exhibition. There, assembled under one roof, one finds the works of ten or twelve artists selected as finalists for the Young Artist of the Year Award from a pool of some fifty contestants by a panel of jurors from Palestine and abroad.6 The first Biennial Exhibition was held in Ramallah in August 2000, shortly before the outbreak of the al- Aqsa intifada. The second was mounted there in September 2002 within a stone’s throw of invading Israeli forces, and the third is planned for the fall of 2004.7 </page> <page sequence="5"> 74 JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES Open to young artists in their twenties “regardless of faith, political alle- giance, or sex,” the contest aimed to foster “the development of the Pales- tinians’ skills and knowledge and the creation of opportunities for artistic self- expression.” The threemain criteria for selectionwere “quality, innovation, and originality.”8 Competing artists must have at least one Palestinian parent, and there are no restrictions on where they are from. Of the ten finalists in 2002, four were from Gaza, four from inside the Green Line, one from Jerusalem, and one from the diaspora. A measure of the kind of opportunity the competition offers is the fact that a number of the finalists of the 2000 and 2002 biennials were invited soon after the competition to show their One of the most striking work abroad, including in New York, Houston, Mon- aspects of the works on treal, Berlin, Barcelona, and Venice.9 display, all of which were One of the most striking aspects of the works on created against a display in the 2002 exhibition, all of which were cre- background of violence, ated against a background of extraordinary violence, destruction, and death, destruction, and death, was the fact that these themes was the fact that these were evoked only obliquely, if at all. And because Pales- themes were evoked only tinian society is under siege and engaged in a ferocious obliquely, if at all. political and military struggle, the outsider could easily expect more overtly politicized works. Thus, the Cuban jury member Mosquera expressed surprise at the absence of “pamphleteer art or nationalistic paintings. In general, the works used contemporary art’s poten- tials to express and discuss quite diverse issues in a complex manner.”10 The works exhibited by the young artists in the 2002 biennial included drawings, paintings, film, photography, mixed media works, video, and installations. The works of six of the finalists are discussed in the following pages.11 EYEWITNESSES FROM THE GAZA GHETTO Ra’ed Issa and Muhammad Hawajri were both born and raised in Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Mainly self-taught, the two artist friends of- ten sketched and painted in the same cramped space. Though their work is strikingly different, it often appears as if the art of one is the continuation of the other’s. Coming from an area subjected to almost daily shelling, Issa and Hawajri, who attended every funeral in town, both worked as field re- searchers in their community for the 100 Shaheed—100 Lives exhibition12 sponsored by the Sakakini Center in February 2001, which commemorated the first one hundred victims of the al-Aqsa intifada. The art they later con- tributed to the Qattan Foundation’s exhibition grew out of their common ex- perience of intimate contact with the bereaved families, though they used dif- ferent means to express the state of being a survivor of and eyewitness to daily death. Deeply rooted in an oral tradition and equally attracted to visual expres- sion, Issa addressed the theme of martyr (shaheed) representationally, while Hawajri explored it more abstractly, in metaphoric and nonrepresentational language.13 </page> <page sequence="6"> ART UNDER THE SIEGE 75 Ra’ed Issa (b. 1975) Issa, who received a Distinction Award at the contest, was represented in the exhibition by seven acrylic paintings and ninety-nine sketches in pencil, charcoal, pen and ink, and watercolor washes. All these works sought to cap- ture the moment when he first saw the body of a man or child wrapped in blood-smeared sheets. With images of the dead and wounded plastered all over the local dailies and flashing nightly on TV screens, Issa saw themartyrs becom- ing an abstraction. In a statement for the exhibition, he explained, “what drew my attention most were the faces of martyrs, especially those whose skulls had been crushed . . . the exact details of [which] were toomuch to take in . . . at the same time, the shock of it would blunt the image of these heads into familiar objects, as if they were watermelons on a table.”14 In his attempt to express the instantaneous quality of his encounters with each of the dead, Issa obsessively repeated images of the martyrs in a manner more common to the documentary photographer. Feverishly executed with violent graphic marks and flowing brush strokes, his portraits occupied a huge wall at the exhibition. The rows of bloodied busts and heads reveal the care with which the artist looked into the face of each one of those who had been killed on their streets or town squares or under the rubble of their homes. In each individual work, the viewer feels the immediacy of that moment. The artist exhibited seven paintings and ninety-nine sketches of martyrs, numbers that suggest a mystical dimension to his series, creation and perpetu- ity. The number seven coincides with the number of days in which God is be- lieved to have created the world. The number ninety-nine in Arabic and Islamic references conveys the multiplicity of attributes found in One; the most pop- ular reference is the ninety-nine Most Beautiful Names of God, pointing to the comprehensive unity inherent in the all-embracing Creator. As an eyewitness to death on each of the seven days of the week, Issa created works to commu- nicate how the grief of each person is no less than that of another, and how the life of each individual is as precious as that of a neighbor. Issa’s homage to the Palestinian martyr can perhaps best be summed up in the thirteenth-century Arabic verse by Ibn ‘Arabi, “faces are all but one, only by counting the mirrors they multiply.”15 Muhammad Hawajri (b. 1976) While Issa, working almost like a documentary photographer, sought to capture in a painterly and representational language what a photograph can never show, Hawajri, taking photography as his starting point, offered what seemed to be abstract paintings. At a time when the Israeli authorities were uprooting fruit trees that were the sole source of income to many Palestinians, Hawajri created a series of works entitled Tales of a Tree. All the works in this series—a dozen color photographs and acrylic paintings and over thirty pencil drawings—were based on Hawajri’s close-up photographs of the trunk of a eu- calyptus tree. Some of the images were photographs, others were photographs </page> <page sequence="7"> 76 JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES overlaid with thick brush strokes of acrylic paint with which he delineated or obscured the photograph’s shapes. The series of pencil sketches reveal the minute process whereby the object captured in a photographic close-up is transformed into what looked like an abstract painting. Man Ray’s dictum that he photographs what he does not wish to paint and paints what he cannot photograph16 seems flat when one contemplates the obvious passion with which the young self-taught artist—for whom crossing borders between photography and painting seems second nature—expresses through his art the emotions the eucalyptus tree evokes in him. The problem to be solved by the young artist in his contemplative stance before his subject is how to give shape to what his eye perceives while not losing touch with the verbal metaphor in his mind. The answer is evolved through the pencil drawings that link his photographs to his paintings. Examining the elements linking the three media used, the viewer begins to trace the tree trunk’s transformation into what resembles the human groin and limbs. The smooth surface of the tree in the close-up photograph recalls human skin; in painting over the bark patterns, Hawajri’s brush seems to suggest caressing the skin of a beloved. The tree, a feminine noun in Arabic, is thus experienced as a living body. Ancient graffiti carved on the trunk in someworks reinforce the sense of times past where lovers like him may have stood before the tree. Its bark patterns in coffee browns and pale greens reflect the cycle of dying and rebirth. Just as Issa wished through his repeated representational portraits to sanc- tify the martyr, his friend sought through abstraction to incarnate the tree. As different as the works of the two artists appear, verbal associations underlying their works help to maintain the link between them. Thus, the word “tales” in the title of Hawajri’s series announces the link between visual expression and oral tradition in a similar way that the number of works comprising Issa’s series conveys affinities with mysticism. By highlighting the tree’s ability to narrate, Hawajri endows the tree with an anthropomorphism that is accentuated by the fact that all his works in this series assume the vertical shape traditionally associated with the portrait. In contrast, all works in Issa’s series of disfigured portraits are horizontal, a form that has been pictorially associated with the landscape. Thus, while Hawajri personalizes the frontal particularities of a tree trunk, Issa shows in his horizontal works how the long sleep of a youth as- sumes the shape of a landscape. Interestingly, both friends were giving body to the same metaphorical image that has been popularized by Palestinian poet Mahmud Darwish. In this image evoking associations with the martyr, the poet likened the native landscape to the body of his beloved, and the motherland as an extension of his own body. JERUSALEM IN THE HEART For most Palestinians, life in the Gaza refugee camps where the above two artists are from continues to be viewed as the nethermost abyss. In comparison, </page> <page sequence="8"> ART UNDER THE SIEGE 77 Palestinians in the diaspora appear in another world altogether.17 The art of Rosalind Nashashibi, who was born abroad, demonstrates a binding engage- ment with her ancestral land that challenges this assumption. In contrast, the art of Steve Sabella, who continues to live in his birthplace, represents the experience of being an exile at home. These two artists, each of whom received a Special Mention Award, never met before their work was shown together in the Ramallah exhibition. The ancestry of both artists, however, is rooted in the city of Jerusalem. Nashashibi comes from a notable urban family that has been involved in shaping the mod- ern history of the city, while Sabella, as his Latin name suggests, belongs to a Jerusalem family whose origins go back to Crusader times. Rosalind Nashashibi (b. 1973) Born in London to a Palestinian father and an Irish mother, visual artist Rosalind Nashashibi went to Jerusalem in 2002 for a residency at al-Ma‘mal Foundation for Contemporary Art. Living among relatives in the city where her father grew up and where her family name continues to be recognized by everyone, Nashashibi got the idea for a short film that would bridge time and place. Her sixteen millimeter film, however, was not shot in Jerusalem itself but in a suburb that her grandfather had a hand in founding after the city of his birth was divided in 1948. The film, named for the neighborhood, Dahiyet al-Bareed (the Post Office District), documents how this place that once embodied the fulfillment of a communal dream ended up a no-man’s- land. Reviewed, along with others Nashashibi made, this film was praised as “a lament for an inexplicable, messed-up world that somehow manages to be beautiful both because of and in spite of the things that happen to it.”18 One can understand how a place that “others” call home can be seen by an outsider as an “inexplicable messed-up world.” Seeing the film as an insider, however, provides a totally different aesthetic experience, at least insofar as the place portrayed would not be seen as being “beautiful both because of and in spite of the things that happen to it.” Dahiyet al-Bareed, or the “Post Office District,” was developed north of Jerusalem by a cooperative initiated by employees of Jerusalem’s post office. Most of its residents had lived, before the 1948 war, in the elegant modern neighborhoods in the western hills outside the Old City that grew up with the upwardly mobile urban residential expansion that began in the early years of the century and accelerated during the British Mandate.19 When the western part of Jerusalem fell to the Jewish forces in 1948, all those Arab villas nestled among pinewoods were seized, their residents never allowed to return. Many sought refuge with relatives in the increasingly crowded Old City. As soon as the salvaged half of Jerusalem was revivified under Jordanian custody, those who could aspired to leave the Old City for more spacious quarters with more modern facilities. </page> <page sequence="9"> 78 JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES The residential project of the “District” represented an attempt to recreate the kind of Jerusalem neighborhood that was lost in 1948. Built of the same gray white stone used in the pre-1948 neighborhoods, the comfortable dwellings were graced with similar arched windows, balconies, multiple verandas, and even the same colorful floral patterned tiles, produced by the same family man- ufactory in the Old City, as the West Jerusalem villas.20 Similarly, pines and cypresses were planted in the open spaces of the neighborhood. The prosper- ity of the “District,” however, came to an end after the June 1967 war, when Israel annexed the Old City and expanded Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries to encompass seventy square kilometers of additional West Bank land includ- ing the “District” and twenty-eight villages. To secure a Jewish majority in the newly defined city limits, Israel issued special ID cards that conferred the sta- tus of “resident” on the Palestinian inhabitants, Christian and Muslim, whose ancestors had lived in the city for hundreds of years. The cards were subject to renewal and could be revoked at any time. Indeed, as Jewish settlements built on Palestinian lands began to ring the Old City, growing numbers of Palestinian residents of the city lost their ID cards. In the meantime, the Jerusalem municipality had stopped serving the “Dis- trict.” Cut off from Jerusalem, which for two decades supplied its lifeline, the place began to die a slow death. Barbed wires and military checkpoints were soon set up at its gates. Having lost municipal sanitation services and garbage collection, the community procured its own garbage containers, but these were confiscated by the Israeli authorities. The only way left to dispose of garbage was to incinerate it in a public place within the “District.” The defining feature of the neighborhood soon became the suffocating odor of the smoke from the heaps of garbage burned daily in the open not far from the deterio- rating villas. Nashashibi’s filmdocuments,with a detachment free of nostalgia or rhetoric, a typical afternoon in this forgotten place. At a distance, we see children playing football at the day’s end. A prayer call of a mosque in the horizon is scarcely heard. Closer by, some street guys hang out. The viewer waits for something to happen. Nothing does. The sudden roar of a passing truck fades soon after it is heard. By staring into the void where time barely moves, the unbearable state of waiting for something to happen makes the viewer uneasily aware of the kind of waiting refugees and exiles know so well. The recurring feature in this suspended world is the burning of a heap of garbage. For six long minutes, which is the length of her film, Nashashibi puts us before a landscape that is undefined by beginning or end. Only after the lights are on when we feel as if we were waking up from a bad dream, we can be- gin to imagine the anguish of how an urban community of Palestinians was gradually choked off. Nashashibi’s testimonial work would have been a night- mare to her grandfather. He could not have imagined how cruelly the daily life of fellow Jerusalemites has once again been severed from their city of birth. </page> <page sequence="10"> ART UNDER THE SIEGE 79 Steve Sabella (b. 1975) Steve Sabella was born in Jerusalem eight years after Israel annexed it. Though he continues to live in Jerusalem’s Old City, none of the photographs he submitted to the exhibition show any trace of it. One explanation for this may lie in the peculiar relationship that evolved over a century between the his- tory of photography, Sabella’s medium, and the significance of his hometown to the outside world. Photography was barely four years old whenWestern photographers rushed to try to capture Jerusalem on film, one of the first cities that interested them outside Europe. While most Western photographers recording Jerusalem fo- cused on biblical sites and historical monuments, with native figures appear- ing either as a means of indicating scale, in the staging of biblical scenes, or to document ethnic or folkloric customs, the artistic interests of the Arab pho- tographers born in the city seemed to lie elsewhere. Khalil Ra’ad, the first native-born professional to establish his studio in the city, in 1890, is an il- lustrious example.21 Ra’ad’s Jerusalem photographs, both in and outside the city, focused not on monuments but on the daily life of ordinary people at their various pursuits. At a time when Reinhold Niebuhr’s slogan “land with- out a people for a people without a land” was being diffused throughout a world ruled by colonialism, Ra’ad was photographing dense street scenes, people basking in the sun, craftspeople before their wheels, factory work- ers stacking Nablus soap bars, villagers pruning their olive trees, and farm- ers cultivating their fields. As for the iconic images that represented the cul- tural appropriation of Jerusalem even before the birth of the Jewish state, it is interesting to note that the Zionist movement popularized the image of a sixteenth-century minaret presented as the “Tower of David.”22 Since Israel’s 1967 annexation of Jerusalem’s Old City and its environs, photographic images of every stone and monument within the city walls has been reduced to some form of cliche ́ to serve nationalist ends. Even images of the Dome of the Rock, the 1,300-year-old Islamic monument, has been appropriated for Israeli tourist posters. As a visual artist growing up in Jerusalem, Sabella seems to have been in- tuitively aware of the pitfalls of photographing it. Sensing how photography has been used to contribute to the mythmaking around him, this internal exile goes out into the open, beyond the city walls, to find his freedom between the rocks and the sky. Here, from a hilltop we see a dirt road winding across a burned-out field leading into a ridge of rocks dissolving into darkness; there, from below a tree, we see a ladder leaning against bare branches and pointing into the sky. Elsewhere we see a heavy cloud hovering in midair over a rock-ribbed hill; at the end of an arid stretch of land, a mountain of pure limestone perches against the deep blue of the sky. From closer up, we see a mount of bare and craggy rocks aging as it were among wild bushes; above a slope, we see four identical cubical dwellings that dot the horizon sharply splitting sky from earth. The city that from time immemorial was considered a bridge between heaven and earth </page> <page sequence="11"> 80 JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES may be absent in Sabella’s photographs, but everything in them indicates how, in solitude, the native photographer rebuilt his own Jerusalem. Just as Ra’ad’s photographs could appear to an outsider to resemble those of ethnically oriented photographers of his time, Sabella’s crisp works of sky and rocks could to an outsider appear to be thework of a professional photographer from anywhere in the world. And yet, it is in Sabella’s conscious avoidance of photographing Jerusalem that he was able to recreate the universality of the place. Indeed, his search for his true self may be likened to those monks who, drawn to Jerusalem from distant lands, ended up living out the rest of their lives in those desolate landscapes. Only in such landscapes did Sabella find his own Jerusalem. From among the rocks of the Palestinian wilderness, the Jerusalem photographer defines his own identification with the pristine state of his ancestral land. Through the way he lets us see these ancient rocks, Sabella reminds us that it was around a rock that his own city of birth was once founded. A VISION FROM WITHIN Palestinianswho continued to live in their homeland inwhatwas declared as the State of Israel were referred to by their compatriots elsewhere as Palestini- ans of “the interior.” Evenwhile theywere suffering under themilitary rule, they were often viewed with suspicion by other Arabs during the first two decades after Palestine’s fall. Following the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, however, the perception changed: speaking both Hebrew and Arabic and surviving in the midst of their conquerors, the Palestinians of the “interior” came to be seen as a breed apart for their resiliency, endurance, and special skills. The price they paid for this was living in two worlds, in un- easy tension between two identities permanently in conflict that forced them to experience the self and the other in ways that may be incomprehensible to an outsider. In metaphoric language, the two young artists from the “interior” who were among the finalists in the Qattan Foundation’s exhibition attempted to give body to the dilemma lived by their community. Though the artists had never met before, and the mode of expression of one could hardly be more distant from that of the other, their common experience as Palestinians from Israel seems to have led them independently to explore the same legend, that of the brothers Cain and Abel. Mikha’il Hallaq (b. 1975) Born in the Galilean village of Fassoota, Hallaq exhibited four oil paintings admirably executed in the representational tradition of Palestinian churchpaint- ings popularized by Faddul ‘Odeh, another Galilean, at the turn of the twenti- eth century. Though his narrative subject is coded with present-day references (contemporary architectural detail, the remains of a stone house, a checkered headdress), his handling of the medium and his general compositions derive </page> <page sequence="12"> ART UNDER THE SIEGE 81 from a language invented centuries ago in Europe. In an homage to the young of his generation being killed by Israeli fire, his painting Palestinian Martyr borrows its iconography from the Pieta`. In that, the narrative painter seems to act as a translator of popular convictions. In the mode of the popular elevation of the slain to the status of martyr, Hallaq, a Christian by birth, likened the Palestinian dead to the crucified Christ. Themore intriguing of his canvases, however, refers to the legend of the first event after the expulsion from Eden; namely, a man’s killing his own brother. The painting depicts a naked man attacking another. The assailant’s figure, arching forward, is twisting the trapped man’s arm against his hip, and with his bare teeth savagely goes for the throat of his prey. The vanquished, in sur- render, is bending backwards in agony and his squinting eyes implore a bloody sky above. The silhouette of two draped figures standing nearby in the dark observe the ongoing struggle, their solemn presence cloaked in mystery. Lest the viewer think the painting represents the actual biblical scene, a panorama of today’s walled city of Jerusalem crowned by the Dome of the Rock looms in the background. Manal Mahameed (b. 1976) The young woman from the village of Mu‘awiya finally received a permit from the Israeli authorities allowing her to travel to Ramallah for the biennial competition in which she was a finalist. With the succession of military check- points, the journey that in peaceful times takes less than an hour requires a whole day, and the Ramallah that is her destination is under siege. Yet the young woman, only a few months away from giving birth to her first child, was determined to build from local materials an installation that would sum up how she, a Palestinian from Israel, sees the war being waged against her own people by the army of the state of which she is a citizen. In her statement for the exhibition, she wrote, “an imaginary thread stretches between two worlds at odds. It pulls me and I pull it. A thread of light and darkness, of beauty and violence [leading] me into the earliest traces of memory.” She explained how “the ancient image” which had been haunting her was of “that first man who killed his brother and buried him in the most beautiful spot on earth.”23 For her own interpretation of the legend cited in both the Bible and the Qur’an, Manal Mahameed, who received a Special Mention Award, created an installation with a theatrical setting of a boxing ring.24 The four corners of the ring are marked by vertical blocks of varying heights, which she had built locally from unfinished concrete and metal bars from a nearby construction site. Contrasting with these rough materials were the highly polished formica sheets delineating the ring’s floor, cordoned off on three sides by red, blue, and white ropes. Close by, a video playing in a loop shows a long shot of a rolling meadow in which two little boys chase each other playfully around their mother. This idyllic landscape is periodically blocked out by a full-screen close-up of two young men locked in bodily combat. The lingering breeze of the pastoral scene is contrasted with the labored breathing of the fighters. </page> <page sequence="13"> 82 JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES With these opposite images in mind, the spectator entering the boxing ring and crossing the slick and slippery formica floor comes face-to-face with the full body of his or her own reflection in the slightly tilted, massive mirror at the opposite end of the ring. With nothing other than this reflection view, the spectator sees both the attacker and the apparent object of the attack on opposite sides within the fighting ring. CONCLUSION Soon after the Biennial Exhibition was dismantled, art critic and novelist John Berger was invited by the A. M. Qattan Foundation and Birzeit University to give a workshop with his photographer friend Jean Mohr for young writers and visual artists who were living under the siege. Berger had once written, “We live in a world of suffering in which evil is rampant, a world whose events do not confirm our Being, a world that has to be resisted. It is in this situation that the aesthetic moment offers hope.”25 To the young artists who participated in the 2002 Biennial Exhibition, the very act of creating a work of art defied the bleak reality of everyday life in the ghetto where indiscriminate violence was being mercilessly waged against the people they belong to. To the viewers living through the Israeli siege, the artists’ works affirmed that they do not stand alone. Through the wide range of artworks created by the youngest generation of Palestinian artists, a whole new horizon seemed to loom beyond the walls being raised around them. Upon the encounter with each new work, the artist’s and the viewer’s “Being” were for the duration of the encounter reconfirmed. In it, both artist and viewer experienced a certain “aesthetic moment” that was enough to offer what national poet Mahmud Darwish defines as the Palestinian “incurable malady called hope.”26 NOTES 1.
