<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORY AND AUTHORSHIP OF MRS. CRACKENTHORPE'S FEMALE TA TLER The Female Tatler, by Mrs. Crackenthorpe, a Lady that knows every thing, the most vigorous rival of the Tatller, appeared for the first time on Friday, July 8, 1709.2 Mrs. Crackenthorpe presented herself modestly as Mr. Bicker- staff's fellow-laborer in a co-operative enterprise, occupying with her period- ical the "contrary days" not taken by the Tatler, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. With humor, impudence, and dignity she maintained her Female Tatler, not as an imitator, but as the feminine counterpart of its masculine contemporary with the full equality demanded by a modern spouse.3 The omniscient Mrs. Crackenthorpe has never been identified. The article on Thomas Baker in the Dictionary of National Biography refers to the assign- ment of the periodical to him by W. T. Lowndes. H. R. Fox Bourne in his English Newspapers, perhaps on the basis of the general reputation of the author of the Atalantis, assumed that Mrs. Manley was Mrs. Crackenthorpe.' Dr. Nathan Drake, under the handicap of having seen only a few issues of the Female Tatler, attributed it to Thomas Baker, and reported that "its gross personalities obtained its author a sound cudgelling from an offended family 2 In Tatler, No. 229, describing the original periodical as leviathan carrying about him a whole world of inhabitants, Addison observed that among the attacks of the swarm of its dependents the Tatler had to endure being "scolded at by a Female Taller, and slan- dered by another of the same Character under the Title of Atalantis." For representative examples of "pairing" the Tailers see Nos. 2, 7, 29. She had to pay her respects also to the "ill-bred Criticks" who cast an irrational aspersion on the sex by refusing to believe that a woman was the author (see Nos. 11 and 47). 4 H. R. Fox Bourne, English Newspapers (2 vols.; London, 1887), I, 74, 79.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND DOCUMENTS 355 in the city; and in the month of October, 1709, it was presented as a nuisance by the grand jury at Old Bailey."' Mr. George S. Marr reprinted Drake's account verbatim without quotation marks.2 Professor Walter Graham showed independent knowledge of the Female Tatller, but he did not question the attribution to Thomas Baker.3 The Crane-Kaye Census of British News- papers and Periodicals, 1620-1800 credited the Female Tatler to Thomas Baker.4 The very competent Mrs. Crackenthorpe, whatever her sex, wielded the tradition of Queen Anne periodical publication, in abusing her rivals, and in meeting unexpected misfortunes, with "feminine" wit and resourcefulness.5 Being "disingenuously treated" by B. Bragge, the first printer of the Female Tatler, she removed it to A. Baldwin with No. 19, August 15, 1709. B. Bragge, in Mrs. Crackenthorpe's words, "set up some pitiful Scoundrel .... to im- pose upon the Town a sham Paper, upon another Person's Foundation, and talks of Ladies Drawing-Rooms, who was never yet admitted into tolerable Company: .... "8 Although but two copies of the spurious Female Tatler have survived, Mrs. Crackenthorpe testifies to the existence of the paper by condescending to notice it in succeeding issues of the original Female Taller.' Finally, in No. 35, September 26, 1709, she prints a letter full of lively satire from a person just arrived in London from Bath, announcing his discovery of the spurious Female Tatler by "the difference of its style and matter," and describing his meeting with the author of that periodical and his assistant.8 In this first crisis of her career Mrs. Crackenthorpe's triumph was complete when she printed in the same number, in response to her correspondent's entreaty, a situation-wanted advertisement for her needy rival, "so unfortunate to receive, but three half Crowns for Writing Seventeen Spurious Tatlers." The spurious Female Tatler, if this figure is correct, was extant from No. 19, August 17, 1709, to No. 35, September 26, 1709. 1 Nathan Drake, Essays, Biographical, Critical, and Historical Illustrative of the Rambler, Adventurer, and Idler, etc. ....

Her Examiners were incipient Female Tatlers. But she found her particular periodical rival at that time unsatisfactory. She complained in Examiner, No. 50: "This Medler is the perfect Reverse of Sir John Falstaffe; he is not only Dull himself, but he is also the Cause that Dulness is in other Men." 6 Female Tatler, No. 20. 7 See ibid., Nos. 27 and 28; also British Apollo, II, No. 47. Number 19, "by B. Bragge," is preserved in the British Museum, and in the otherwise complete file of the original Female Tatler at Harvard; No. 31 is in the British Museum. s One trait of the assistant's can be definitely connected with Thomas Baker-that of an interest in ballads; note the snatches of two ballads introduced in his Tunbridge Walks (1703), pp. 47, 56.</page><page sequence="3">356 NOTES AND DOCUMENTS The new difficulties which Mrs. Crackenthorpe met successfully in turn were a cudgelling (probably not in propria persona), the operations of a black- mailer in her name, and a presentment of the Female Tatler by a grand jury. Since she was engaged in her musical scolding match with the learned gentle- men of the British Apollo--begun in Female Tatler, No. 21, with her scoffing at their project for printing "musical notes" and giving a "consort" for the benefit of their subscribers-her affairs received a great deal of attention in the rival periodical. The cudgelling of the supposed author of the Female Tatler by an outraged deputy' was celebrated in bad verses by half of the faithful subscribers to the British Apollo. They generally accept Thomas Baker as the Female Tatler, but sometimes entertain two possibilities: You'll say She is some Mother Mab in Disguise, Train'd up from her Birth in Abuses and Lies; Or else you may think by her scurrilous Tongue, From Billingsgale, Bridewell, or Newgate She sprung; Admitting all this (as it seems pretty plain) Regard to her Sex might have warded the Cane. But others will swear that this wise Undertaker, By Trade's an At-ney, by Name is a B-r, Who rambles about with a Female Disguise on, And lives upon Scandal, as Toads do on Poyson.2 Mrs. Crackenthorpe, surviving as a literary personage, at any rate, her sup- posed cudgelling as a real person, found a threat to her productive capacity, nourished by "intelligence" more or less legitimately procured, in a black- mailer who was extorting money from people to secure them from exposure in the Female Tatler. In No. 44, October 17, 1709, in a vigorous notice, re- printed in No. 45, she offered to undertake the prosecution of the blackmailer. On the day of the second appearance of this notice, October 19, 1709, the British Apollo carried an announcement in its news column of the presentment by the grand jury of the scandalous practices of the Female Tatler, the Review of the British Nation, and other papers unnamed, as "a great Nusance."3 On I Mrs. Crackenthorpe had devoted No. 24, August 31, 1709, professedly to satire in general upon the vulgar pretensions of "city" people who were climbing up in the world, but, actually, to malicious caricature in particular of a certain deputy and the conduct of his daughters, "the two Mrs. Bustle's," at a "city" social affair. Her attack was so consummately effective as to leave no remedy open to the victim, unless he were a journal- ist of equal satirical powers, but the grossest physical assault. The deputy chose the cudgel. 2 British Apollo II (September 14, 1709), 49. In many of the references (cf. II, 52, 55) to Baker's female disguise one is in doubt whether actual masquerading is meant, or merely assuming a journalistic pseudonym. The lampoons in the British Apollo and the tradition (recorded by David Erskine Baker) identifying.Maiden, a character in Thomas Baker's Tunbridge Walks, as the author himself reflect his reputation with his contem- poraries for enjoying just such pranks as assuming a female disguise and going abroad to seek "intelligence." I In the next British Apollo a correspondent, implying that the blackmailer might have brought on the action of the grand jury, told a story of an alderman who had refused to advance four guineas to avoid being exposed in the Female Tatler (but cf. Female Tatler, No. 30).</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND DOCUMENTS 357 October 26, 1709, the British Apollo danced in glee about its fallen rival, as though sure of its decease, rejoicing in its being paired with Defoe's Review, and comparing Baker's journalistic misfortune to his previous dramatic one in having his play hissed off the stage.' Though no complete diagram of the personal and causal relationships con- necting these incidents in Mrs. Crackenthorpe's journalistic history can be constructed, one may be inferred with some probability. Thomas Baker, as editor of the spurious rival paper, striving to maintain his precarious enter- prise, and to establish its authenticity, would have been more likely than Mrs. Crackenthorpe herself to be indiscreet in proclaiming his authorship of the Female Tatler. That Thomas Baker had a large part in these roguish projects, and a rogue's reward for them, is a reasonable but unimportant as- sumption,2 once it can be shown that he was not Mrs. Crackenthorpe as his contemporaries thought.3 For a time nothing affected the confident course of Mrs. Crackenthorpe's Female Tatler. She is complacent in her references to the Bustles, and in her renewed attacks upon them.4 Her spurious rival succumbs to her hostility, or to other misfortunes, and she is able to celebrate the decease of the rival Female Tatler in No. 35, September 26. Even after the presentment of the grand jury on October 19 the Female Tatler appears for six numbers without any sign of a change of policy. But in the seventh, No. 51, November 2, 1709, she announces in a single sentence her withdrawal in favor of a society of modest ladies, because of an "Affront offer'd to her by some rude Citizens, al- together unacquainted with her Person." With No. 52 the page assumes its blank appearance, which it is to have henceforward, without the dominating portrait of Mrs. Crackenthorpe, the Latin inscription around the circular frame, Sum canna vocalis," and the final touch of journalistic genius in the pseudonym embodying the spirit of the periodical, "By Mrs. Crackenthorpe, 1 There are other references to the ill success of Baker's Fine Ladies Airs: for example, in II, 50 and 55. Whincop (Scanderberg [1747]) declared the play to have been a success. D'Urfey, in the Preface to The Modern Prophets, said that this play of Baker's was an "Abuse of the fair Sex .... and deservedly hist." 2His persistent obscurity makes any certainty with regard to him or his ventures im- possible. David Erskine Baker's defense of his namesake is, if anything, more partisan, and less convincing than Whincop's attack. The Catalogue of the Hope Collection of the Bodleian Library (Oxford, 1865) credits Thomas Baker with the unsuccessful continuation of the Tatler published by John Baker, in two issues, Nos. 272 and 273. Morphew's con- tinuation of the Tatler in its No. 276 denounces the A. Baldwin TaLler as a spurious con- tinuation of the Tatler by the author of the late Female Tatler. Swift, writing for Harrison, replies humorously in No. 2 denying the allegation. 3 D'Urfey and, possibly, Addison seem to have been exceptions. D'Urfey and his Modern Prophets were the butt of Mrs. Crackenthorpe's wit (Nos. 4, 8, 26, etc.). In his Preface D'Urfey recounts the vicissitudes of his play (acted May 3, 1709 [Tatler, No. 11]; withdrawn and apparently printed by July 19, 1709 [ibid., No. 43]), and strikes out at two critics, the first one, Thomas Baker, who has shaken his dirt upon him in a prologue, and "the other is a profound Coffee-house Wit ....."

Number 52 is issued simply as "Written by a Society of Ladies."' But the new editors had actually taken charge as early as No. 51, for that paper introduces some of them for the first time.2 Number 51, Mrs. Crackenthorpe's farewell number, was written for her by her suc- cessors and published in her absence with a lame explanation for her sudden resignation in a reference to the well-known incident of the cudgelling then two months past. Mrs. Crackenthorpe wrote no paper later than the preced- ing issue, No. 50, "From Friday October 29 to Monday October 31, 1709." On October 29, 1709, according to Narcissus Luttrell, another writing lady was forced to abandon suddenly her wonted occupations: "The pub- lishers and printers of a late book, called the New Atlantis, which character- izes several persons of quality, are taken up, as also Mrs. Manley, the sup- posed author."3 On the first of November the printer and publisher were examined and discharged, but Mrs. Manley remained in custody.4 On the fifth of November she was admitted to bail, but she did not get her discharge until February 14, 1709[-10].' The cessation of Mrs. Crackenthorpe's Female Tatler upon Mrs. Manley's arrest was more than a curious coincidence. Mrs. Crackenthorpe's robust feminism is eminently like Mrs. Manley's, a feminism able to give and take intellectual blows in a man's world. Not overproud of its sex, it is envious of man's strength and education, even half- regretful that fortune had not made it masculine. Like Mrs. Manley, who had set the tone for her autobiography by having Sir Charles Lovemore declare that he had often heard her say, "If she had been a Man, she had been without Fault," Mrs. Crackenthorpe thinks in masculine terms to justify her acts. She selects a masculine analogy to explain her change of printers-"as a Gentleman that is Trickt does his Taylor or Perriwig-maker." This is a subtlety of verisimilitude, more likely to come from a woman, wistfully eager I The sudden change in policy caught the ladies unprepared to supply a Latin motto. Though Mrs. Crackenthorpe had to suffer from the dilatoriness of her portrait-painter in the early days of the Female Tatler, she did not lack a motto from her first number. The new editors repaired their breach of decorum in the next issue with a motto, decorous on any occasion in a classical age--Medium tenuere Beati--which served for three papers, until the motto-finding department of the new organization was ready to supply a change of mottoes with every issue, except for the re-employment of two which were favorites. SNumber 51 tells the story of the lovely Arabella, who competed with the sufferings of Hamlet and Ophelia on the stage for the sympathy of the audience, when she fell desper- ately ill at the theater: "The Play being done, and the Company parting, Polydore, Lycida. and Castalio, went to the House of Clymene and Lucinda, and there entertaining one another, made the Fair and Sick Arabella the Subject of their Discourse ..... ." The reader is thrust without warning into the social group and atmosphere which gives the background for the discussions of the later Female Tatler. Lucinda, in the next issue, is the first of the modest ladies, mentioned by Mrs. Crackenthorpe, to take her turn in writing the Female Tatler. Arabella is enough recovered from her illness to make the first of her three contributions with No. 54. She is claimed in No. 58 by Artesia, like Lucinda a regular editor, as her niece. The history of the later Female Tatler, continued until March 31, 1710, must be reserved for another occasion. I A Brief Historical Relation of State Affairs ....

Mrs. Manley shows herself beneath the masque of Mrs. Crakenthorpe in introducing material from the New Atalantis. She has a chance to welcome, in No. 7, an agreeable communication from a supposed undergraduate ad- mirer, and, in No. 8, to print his letter, and the first instalment of his verse con- tribution, "CHARLOTTE: Or, the Guardian," an attempt from the Memoirs of Atalantis in Homage to Her Female Empire, by Burgersdicius of Oxford.' Mrs. Crackenthorpe's acknowledgment of his compliment, which is nothing more than mentioning her conventionally as his toast, unless she can share in his compliment to the author of the Atalantis in turning her prose fiction into verse, is pure Mrs. Manley in manner, thought, and shades of feeling: Beauty was ever the least of my Aim, I would rather chuse to recommend my self by a tolerable Understanding; 'tis true, it heightens a Lady's Character, and when a fine Woman shall deliver her self in an Elegant manner, her Beauty, like sweetning a Note in Musick, is a grace to her Expression; and the Men are ravish'd with her, when they'd be but barely pleas'd with one less agreeable: But if Gentlemen would not value a Woman chiefly for her Person . 2... . The elusive Mrs. Crackenthorpe is secured by her allusions to her own family.3 Sometimes her references are extensive and somewhat literary, as in No. 43 on the Crackenthorpe's, or in No. 47 on her suitors. The Cavalier sentiments and sufferings of the Crackenthorpes, though suited to the Man- leys, are too general to identify them. But her casual or facetious allusions, incapable of serving a journalistic or literary end, or of contributing anything but private amusement to Mrs. Crackenthorpe, or petty irritation to the per- sons satirized, are conclusive. Mary de la Rivicre Manley had a sister Mary- Mary Elizabeth Brathewaite, as her name is given in their father's will. Mrs. Manley's state of mind with regard to this sister and her husband seems to have been fairly constant. In the second volume of the New Atalantis, October 1709, she says that she and her younger sister were left to the care of their cousin, "the eldest having much the Advantage of us in Age, was marry'd, and gone off with a Husband so ill-natured and disobliging, that our Family I See New Atalantis (4 vols., 1736), I, 44-82, for the story of Charlotte and her guardian the Duke. There is another reference to the New Atalantis in Female Tatler, No. 45: "Lady Fancy-ful, who had the Vanity to think herself expos'd in the Memoirs from the New Atalantis, started the Question, What kind of Creatures are these Poets?" 2 In No. 14 she reports that the second part of "Charlotte" is come to hand, and she prints it in No. 15. SPersonal allusions lurk on both sides of every folio sheet. Many of them can be in- terpreted by a reader who has a knowledge of Mrs. Manley's works. The identification, for example, of one of the editors of the British Apollo, described in Female Tatler, No. 30, as "Dr. Pusillanimous, who upon Second Thoughts is set up for a great Scruple-salver as well as Oculist," is supplied by Letter XI of The Lady's Pacquet broke open, published by B. Bragge in 1707 in two parts with translations from Mine d'Aulnoy (familiar to bibliog- raphers hitherto only in its pirated form, Court Intrigues [1711]-see notice in Examiner, I, 46), which gives a brief criticism of Dr. William Coward's Second Thoughts Concerning the Human Soul (1702; 2d ed., 1704).</page><page sequence="7">360 NOTES AND DOCUMENTS no longer conversed with theirs."' In 1714, in the Adventures of Rivella, she speaks of her older sister again: "Maria the eldest, was unhappily bestow'd in Marriage, (at her own Request, by her Father's fondness and assent to his Daughter's Choice) on a Wretch every way unworthy of Her. . '. ."2 Two passages from the Female Tatler need little more than quotation. She does not write her paper for profit, Mrs. Crackenthorpe remarks in the first issue with brave irony, "for all that I have the Honour to be intimate with, know that I have an Estate of 300 1. per An. and always keep two Maids and a Footman; but if I should happen to succeed beyond my Expectation, it might so far advance my Fortune, that I may be able to keep a Coach as well as my Sister Mickelthwait." The satire of a facetious advertisement in No. 20 is directed to her esteemed brother-in-law: Mrs. Crackenthorpe wants a strong Yorkshire Fellow that has none of his Coun- try Tricks, and able to go thro' all manner of Business, to live with her Brother, Copperthwaite in the Country; he must be Coachman, Groom, Butler, Gardiner, Valet de Chambre, go to Plow, and play Country Dances upon the Fiddle. If any such Fellow is willing to serve for Three Pounds Ten a Year, and a Course Grey Livery, he may walk down to Pains-taking Hall, Seventeen Miles beyond West- Chester, and live there till he has work'd out an Estate in the Family. Unlike Mrs. Manley and her sister, two sisters with but one name, Mrs. Manley and Mrs. Crackenthorpe were two personalities but one person. Mrs. Manley was Mrs. Crackenthorpe.
