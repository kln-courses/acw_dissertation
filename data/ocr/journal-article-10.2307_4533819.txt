ROPER 1) and E. POLIOUDAKIS (Department of Psychology, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, U.S.A.) (With 4 Figures and 2 Plates) (Acc. 5-VI-,976) The Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) has recently become a popular subject for studies of rodent social behaviour, and in particular of behaviour associated with scent marking (SCHWENTKER, I972). In common with other Cricetidae it possesses a ventral sebaceous gland pad (GLENN &amp; GRAY, I964; MITCHELL, I965; SOKOLOV &amp; SKURAT, I966) which it rubs on the substrate or on prominent objects, thereby depositing a visible smear of yellow musky-smelling sebum (THIESSEN, I973). The gland is present in both sexes, but is larger in males (GLENN &amp; GRAY, I964), and is androgen dependent (MITCHELL, I965). It is tempting to suppose that marking is related to olfactory communica- tion, and BARAN &amp; GLICKMAN (1970) have shown that the response is greatly reduced by olfactory bulbectomy. MITCHELL (I965, I967) suggested that the scent might be a sex attractant, but abandoned this hypothesis when he found that glandectomised gerbils did not show any deficit in sexual behaviour. SOKOLOV &amp; SKURAT (I966), citing observations of marking in Rhombomys optimus, speculated that in this species and in M. unguiculatus the scent serves to demarcate territory. This hypothesis has been adopted by THIESSEN and his coworkers, who have habitually referred to ventral marking in Mll. unguiculatus as "territorial marking" (e.g. THIESSEN, I968, I973; THIESSEN, FRIEND &amp; LINDZEY, I968; THIESSEN, OWEN &amp; LINDZEY, I97'). i) This work was supported by grant MH I3079, awarded to T.

POLIOUDARIS The territorial hypothesis is based largely on studies in which strange adult male gerbils have been paired in confined enclosures. In such circumi- stances severe fighting results, from which one animal usually emerges as consistent victor. It has been found that the victor continues to mark at a high rate, whereas the defeated animal shows a decline in marking specific to environments contaminated with the scent of the victor (NYBY, THIESSEN &amp; WALLACE, I970; THIESSEN, OWEN &amp; LINDZEY, I97I). However the notion that marking serves to defend territory is contradicted by evidence that gerbils mark at least as much in novel environments as in their home cages (THIESSEN, OWEN &amp; LINDZEY, I971), and that the marks of other animals, far from inducing withdrawal, seen to stimulate further investigation (BARAN &amp; GLICKMAN, I970; BARAN, I973). In view of the latter, it seems likely that the inhibition of marking observed in defeated animals by NYBY et al. and THIESSEN et al. may have been merely part of a general fright response resulting from consistent terrorisation in an environment from which escape was impossible. A number of authors have also postulated a relation between marking and "dominance", but their hypotheses suffer from confusion between within- group and between-group social behaviour. NYBY et al. and THIESSEN et al. refer to the defeated animals in their studies as "submissive", and to the victors as "dominant". Similarly in a study in which I5 adult gerbils from different social groups were confined together, GALLUP &amp; WAITE (I970) describe the outcome of the resultant fighting as the setting up of a domi- nance hierarchy. However the emergence of a clear victor from aggressive encounters between strange animals is clearly a different issue from the setting up of a dominance hierarchy within an established social group, as occurs in various primates (RICHARDS, I974), and a number of other non- primate species (VAN KREVELD, 1970). Besides the intrinsic difficulties in the evidence on which they are based, theories of territoriality and dominance in the gerbil lack supporting evidence from field observations, since scarcely anything is known of the social be- haviour of M. unguiculatus in the wild (ALLEN, I940; TANIMOTO, I943; BANNIKOV, I954). Field studies of various species of Saharan gerbils show that most of these are neither territorial nor dominant in the rigorous sense (DALY &amp; DALY, I974, 1975a, 1975b); but in view of the consider- able variation in social organisation which occurs in the Gerbillinae these conclusions may not be applicable to M. unguiculatus. Finally, it should be borne in mind that scent marking may have many functions other than the demarcation of territories or the maintenance of dominance orders (RALLS, I971; JOHNSTON, I975a).</page><page sequence="3">..^... :.....- ls torgh): runingwhe, nubee stns emt bote strp of pae fornesting, cador tue netboe \1 ad4 aebtl cae_big to sn-o, an tee.Th obevrstein tewodnp tton atly viil in th pe ethn onr</page><page sequence="4">t0 if X, ..... . . g _ 11 1 M~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~..... 6 Close-up of the burrow area showing two gerbils (M2 and Fi) emerging.

Our inten- tions were: (i) To provide information about the circumstances of marking in the home environment as a first step towards assessing its function; (2) To see whether marking or any other aspect of behaviour indicated the existence of a dominance hierarchy within the social group; and (3) To provide basic information about as much as possible of the species' behav- ioural repertoire. METHODS Animals. Five male and three female gerbils, aged i6 weeks, were obtained from a local sup- plier. Early in the study four animals were killed or removed (see below), and the Results refer mainly to the behaviour of the remaining two males (M2 and M4) and two females (Fi and F2). Environment. The environment was located in a sound-proofed air-conditioned experimental room, 4 X 3 X 3 m. The end of the room into which the door opened was separated off by means of a 70 cm high plywood partition, so as to leave a 75 cm wide space in which the observer could sit. A cardboard screen was placed in front of the observer's chair to conceal movements of his hands and body. The remaining area, 3.3 X 3 m, formed the gerbil enclosure. A corner area, 1.5 X 1.5 m, was partitioned off by means of 30 cm high wooden planks, and was filled to a depth of 25 cm with a mixture of sand and fine loam in which the gerbils could burrow. An Oregon grape bush and a small fir tree were planted near the wall in order to provide some cover, and four large numbered stones were laid out on the surface of the earth to form a reference grid (see Plates I and 2 and Fig. 3). This part of the enclosure will be referred to as the sand-box. The L-shaped area around the sand-box was covered with a thin layer of San-i-cel to absorb droppings, and the following objects were placed in it (see Fig. 3). i. A running wheel (RW) 20 cm in diameter X 8 cm wide, constructed of Plexiglas and 0.5 cm wire mesh. The wheel was primarily intended to give information about the animals' diurnal activity rhythm, and revolutions were automatically counted by means of a magnet-operated sealed-reed switch, and recorded on apparatus located in an adjoin- ing room. 2. Four empty nest-boxes (NBI-4), each consisting of an inverted white plastic mouse cage, 28 X i8 X I8 cm, with a hole cut in one end for access. It was not known whether the gerbils would be able to dig a successful burrow in the sand-box, so the nest-boxes were provided as an alternative. 3. Three water bottles (WI-3), two mounted on transparent plastic mouse cages, and the third on the plywood partition at the end of the enclosure. A hole was cut in the side of each mouse cage to allow the animals to enter. 4. A cardboard tube (CT), 6o cm long X 5 cm in diameter, and four empty water bottles (BI-4), placed on their sides. We have found that gerbils in restricted con- ditions spend a large proportion of their time gnawing card or scrabbling in empty bottles, and these items were included to see whether such behaviour would occur in a more open environment. 5. Two dead branches, about 6o cm long. These were additional material for gnawing, and possible sites for chin marking (see DALY &amp; DALY, I975a).</page><page sequence="6">T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOUDAKIS 6. Four large stones (S5-8) were placed at intervals around the area to divide it into roughly equal sections and provide a reference grid. It was also expected that the gerbils might use the stones as ventral marking sites. The stones, nest-boxes, water sources and empty bottles were numbered conspicuously so as to be identifiable by the observer. Food (rodent chow, canine chow, sunflower seed and wheat grain) was scattered over the floor of the open area, newspaper strips and straw were provided for nest material, and a number of bark chips and small stones were scattered around as alter- native marking sites. A wire-mesh bridge was provided as a means of access to and from the sand-box. Artificial light was provided on a LD 12:12 cycle. Dawn and dusk were simulated by switching on or off at intervals of 15 min an array of eight light bulbs: three Io-W, three 25-W, one 6o-W, and one Ioo-W. During the 'day', when all of these were on, the light intensity was 8 lumens/sq ft measured at ground level in the center of the enclosure. A shaded i5-W bulb burned continuously to provide illumination about equi- valent to bright moonlight during the 'night'. Dawn and dusk were originally set at 2I.I5 to 23.00 hr, and 09.I5 to II.oo hr respectively, since the animals were expected to be noctural (THIESSEN et al., I968; STUTZ, 1972). However it subsequently became evident that they were emerging mainly during the light phase, so in week 3 these times were reversed. Temperature was maintained at 22°C. Procedure. After purchase the animals were individually marked by removing small patches of fur from their bodies and tails with depilatory cream, attempts to dye their fur having failed. The marks did not appear to affect their behaviour, and remained visible for about two months. The animals were housed together in an aquarium in the experimental room for two weeks, and were then released into the enclosure. Very little maintenance was required: food and water were replenished every two weeks, and the animals were live-trapped and re-marked twice. The study lasted from April I3 to August I7 I975, a total of i8 weeks. Observations. The enclosure was inspected briefly each morning, and any new diggings were mapped. Behaviour was usually observed from I6.oo00 to I8.00 hr, but occasionally at other times during the light phase of the cycle. Data from the first six weeks were excluded from analysis due to changes in the light cycle (see above), and to the occurrence of several fatalities (see p. 219). From week 6 to week I7 there were no further fatalities, and the behaviour of the colony appeared stable. The results reported below are based on the I20 hours of observation made during this period, when the colony consisted of two males (M2 and M4), two females (Fi and F2) and their offspring. Data from days on which a female was in oestrus are presented separately. Observation was continuous. Encounters between pairs of animals were scored by means of check sheets, an encounter being defined as an episode involving bodily contact between two animals. (Encounters involving more than two individuals were too complex to score, but were relatively rare). The check-sheet data consisted of the identity of the animals involved, and the occurrence of various activities and postures (see below). No formal sampling procedure was used since with only four animals encounters tended to occur singly, but some encounters were undoubtedly missed while the observer was writing. In addition, shorthand notes were taken of the occurrence of various activities involving individual animals. 210</page><page sequence="7">BEHAVIOUJR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 2II Nomenclature. Complete ethograms exist for the Heteromyid rodents (EISENBERG, I963a), the genus Peromyscus (EISENBERG, I962, I967), Meriones persicus (EIBL-EIBESFELDT, I951), and Gerbillus nanus (KIRCHSHOFER, I958), all of which have a large number of behaviour patterns in common with M. unguticulatus. EISENBERG (I967) provides a summary no- menclature in English and German, from which the terms cited below are largely taken. Readers are referred to these sources for complete descriptions of the behaviour pat- terns, and to SWANSON (1974) and REYNIERSE (I971) for descriptions of agonistic be- haviour in M. tnguiculatus. For a review of gerbil taxonomy see SCHWENTKER (1972). The following behaviour patterns were recorded: a. Activities scored during encounters. Approach from a distance. If one animal conspicuously approached the other this was scored. This category was not rigorously definable, and in many cases it was debatable whether or not an encounter resulted from a deliberate approach. Nose/nose contact. This was oftent established from a head-on approach, with the animals reaching tentatively towards one another. Sometimes the ears were flattened and the eyes partly closed. Nose/ano-genital contact. Nose/gland contact. This refers to the ventral sebaceous gland present in both sexes (GLENN &amp; GRAY, I964). One animal might push its nose under the ventral surface of the other, or sniff at the gland while the other was standing upright. Upright. Rearing up on the hind legs. Sparring. Rapid sparring movements with the fore paws while standing upright. Sidling. One animal adopts a sideways posture with respect to the other, usually in a slightly hunched position with the head tilted downwards away from the opponent, and the forepaws just off the ground. SWANSON (1974) refers to this as 'sideways offensive', but DALY &amp; DALY (1974) suggest that it serves to avert a fight in M. lybicus and P. obesus. NYBY, THIESSEN &amp; WALLACE (1970) state that during sidling in M. unguiculatus the sidler may push its opponent with its flank, but we never saw this behaviour. Locked fighting. This sometimes involved the animals rolling over or leaping into the air (cf. SWANSON, I974). Biting. This was clearly visible only when the animals were upright or sidling, when a bite was occasionally directed towards the neck of the opponent. Biting probably also occurred during locked fighting and chasing. Chasing. Mounting. Lordosis. Mutual grooming. Ventral marking. The ventral sebaceous gland was used to mark the substrate or another animal. Marking the substrate was only scored as part of an encounter if no other activity intervened. b. Activities recorded for individual animals. Alert posture. EISENBERG (I967) does not seem to distinguish this from 'upright', which it resembles in form. However a separate term seems desirable since this activity occurs in a non-social context when the animal is alarmed, and often involves a more fully erect and more stable posture. The animal may remain alert for several minutes, surveying the field and sniffing the air. Drumming. Drumming on the substrate by means of rapid movements of the hind feet, while in the alert posture. This is often called foot-thumping or food-stomping. I4</page><page sequence="8">2I2 T. J.

Table i shows the total number of encounters observed for each pair of animals, and the total number involving each individual animal. M2 was involved in substantially more encounters than any other animal, and his encounters with M4 were particularly numerous.

In order to compensate for such individual differences scores will henceforth be presented as percentages of the total number of encounters involving each animal or pair of animals. Unfortunately there can be no statistical analysis of the results, since the number of animals surviving the initial fighting was too small. Table 2 shows the percentage of encounters between each pair of animals involving each of I2 social activities. 'Active' refers to the animal performing the activity - e.g. M4 approached M2 on 44% of their encounters, and M2 approached M4 on 23 % (Table 2a). Figure i summarizes the results by showing for each activity the total percentage of encounters in which each animal was active, and the percentage in which it was passive (i.e. in which it was the recipient).

The results suggest a number of sex differences in social behaviour. Figure ia shows that the males tended to approach other animals more frequently than did the females, and Table 2a shows that they approached the females somewhat more frequently than one another. This is supported by the general impression that the females tended to spend more of their time consistently pursuing non-social activities such as digging or nest-building, while the males roamed about the enclosure.

Of these activities nose/ ano-genital contact, sidling, chasing and mutual grooming were most often directed towards the females, whereas upright and sparring occurred most frequently between homosexual pairs, and in particular between males (Table 2e and f). The females were more often active in nose/gland contact, locked fighting and biting (Fig. ic, g and i). Nose/gland contact and biting tended to be directed more towards the males than towards the other female (Table 2c and i), but the sex difference in locked fighting was solely at- tributable to its absence from male/male encounters (Table 2g). Within-sex individual differences were less conspicuous. Fi was involved</page><page sequence="11">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 2I5 less frequently than F2 in upright and sidling, and was groomed less fre- quently than F2 by the males (Table 2e, h and 1). M4 made a slightly higher proportion of approaches than M2, and was involved in nose/nose contact with the females somewhat more often (Table 2a and b). About 60-70%v of encounters involved obvious approaches on the part of one or both animals, but this category was poorly defined, and close ob- servation would probably reveal a higher proportion of deliberate approaches. The most frequent (85-95%0), and usually the first and only, activity was nose/nose contact. The next most frequent were upright (25-50%), sparring (iS-40o) and sidling (about 25%6), of which sparring and sidling generally followed upright. Other activities were relatively rare. 2. Mutual marking and grooming. These activities deserve special comment since they have not been described before in detail, and might be expected to reveal a dominance hierarchy if one existed. Twenty-seven bouts of mutual marking were observed. With the exception of M4, which was not marked by either female, all the animals were marked by one another on at least one occasion (Table 2k). In addition F2 was twice seen to mark a pup. Marking consisted of one animal crawling under or over the other, pressing its body close against that of its partner. Usually both partners marked one another in a single bout, often in repeated sequences of circling under and over. Mutual grooming was also fairly infrequent, but often accompanied mutual marking. One animal lay flat against the ground, often with its eyes closed, while the other groomed its head, shoulders and back. Bouts of grooming often lasted for several minutes, during which the two animals might change places. The behaviour occurred most frequently on a mound of earth near the rear wall of the sand-box, which was a site subjected to frequent marking (see below and Fig. 3). We have seen gerbils in confined conditions grooming one another's ventral surfaces but this was not observed in the present study, and may only occur in the nest. Mutual grooming is common in other species of rodents, and has been described in Peromyscus by EISENBERG (I962). Mutual marking and grooming were preceded by the same preliminaries as other encounters (e.g. nose/nose contact, nose/gland contact), but were never accompanied by agonistic behaviour. 3. Sexual behaviour. When one or other female was in oestrus the usual peacefulness of the colony was disrupted, and the behaviour of all animals underwent a drastic change. Results from these days were therefore excluded from the previous</page><page sequence="12">2I6 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOUDAKIS analysis, and are presented separately here. Observations were made of two post-partum oestruses in each female, and data from these have been pooled. Observational procedure was the same as in normal sessions except that check sheet data included information about the sequential order of different activities, as well as their frequencies of occurrence. The most conspicuous change in the colony structure when a female was in oestrus was that M2 became highly aggressive towards M4, and persistent- ly drove him away from the female in question. As a result M2 obtained almost exclusive access to the female, the average number of mounts per 2 hr session being 72 for M2 and I2 for M4. On the first two occasions the males engaged in locked fighting several times, but during subsequent oestrus periods M4 fled whenever M2 approached, and spent most of the session hiding in the burrow or in the branches of the fir tree. Prolonged bouts of wild chasing around the enclosure also occurred. Occasionally when M4 did succeed in approaching the oestrus female she lordosed for him quite readily, indicating that the greater mating success of M2 was attributable to his aggressiveness rather than to a preference on the part of the female. Several times M2 drove off M4 while he was attempting to mount, but the reverse was never observed. But in spite of the vigour of M2's attacks aggressiveness between the males was strictly limited to days in which a female was in oestrus, and was otherwise completely absent. Copulation in M. unguiculatus is characterised by multiple intromissions and ejaculations, without repeated thrusting. KUEHN &amp; ZUCKER (I968) have found that number of intromissions per ejaculation is higher than in rats, hamsters or deermice, and declines with successive ejaculatory series. At the times of observation (late in the light phase) the females were highly receptive, and successive mounts were often separated by as little as a few seconds. The most usual sequence of events was for the male to approach the female, and engage in nose/nose and nose/ano-genital contact. The female than darted rapidly away from the male for a distance of about I5-30 cm, stopped suddenly, and lordosed, by which time the male had caught up and was able to mount. After a single intromission the female rejected the male by jerking her rump backwards, and again ran a short distance away. The sequence was usually repeated almost immediately but sometimes, presum- ably after ejaculation, longer pauses occurred during which both animals engaged in genital grooming. Drumming, almost always by the male, oc- curred immediately after 9% of mounts, and was most frequent in the presumed post-ejaculatory intervals (cf. KUEHN &amp; ZUCKER, I968). It also occurred, but less frequently, during the initial stages of an encounter, when the male would halt a few inches away from the female and drum prior to</page><page sequence="13">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 2I7 making nose/nose or nose/genital contact. In neither circumstance did drumming elicit any obvious response on the part of the female. The average number of ventral marks per session was M2: 4, M4: 2, oestrus female: 2I, other female: I, of which the score for the oestrus female was considerably outside the range recorded for normal days. Only a small proportion of the marks deposited by the oestrus female were made in conjunction with encounters with a male, and most of them occurred at sites which were most heavily marked in normal circumstances (see Fig. 3). When the males marked they did so mainly after encounters with one an- other. Figure 2 shows first-order transitional probabilities linking the major events in the copulatory sequence. The sequence was always linear (there are no backward arrows in Fig. 2), but one or other activity was sometimes omitted, especially in the early stages. Of the sequences started only 75%o d approach 9 noso/nose .2 .4 nose/ano-genital .2 9 dart d'chase .1 . 9 lordose agonistic d'mount behaviour Fig. 2.

As Fig. 2 shows, nose/ano-genital sniffing was al- ways followed by darting and chasing, and the latter almost always by lordosis and mounting. Higher order transitional analysis showed that in- stances in which chasing led to agonistic behaviour rather than lordosis al- ways occurred in sequences in which nose/ano-genital sniffing had been omitted. This suggests that sniffing by the male stimulates the female to lordose rather than to respond aggressively, although sniffing is not a neces- sary condition for lordosis.</page><page sequence="14">2I8 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOUDAKIS 4. Maternal behaviour. Two litters were produced by each female during the course of the study, the dates of parturition being June 6 and July 9 for Fi, and June I4 and July i5 for F2. The litter sizes were 3 and 5, and 5 and 6, respectively, and post-partum oestrus occurred in all cases. Fi's first pregnancy was not suspected until two days before parturition, when the entrance to nest-box i was seen to be blocked with a pile of Sa'n-i-cel, and a nest of shredded paper was found inside. Prior to this all the animals had shared the. burrow, and had largely ignored the nest-boxes. On the day of parturition Fi was observed repeatedly entering and leaving the nest-box and wandering restlessly in and out of the burrow. The following moming she was found inside nest-box I suckling a litter of three pups. During the following week both females entered and left the nest-box periodically, staying inside it for up to 30 min at a time. Immediately after entering and leaving they always blocked the entrance again by digging the San-i-cel back over it and tamping it down with their fore-paws and noses. This behaviour was quite novel, and was never applied to the burrow entrances. The males never entered the nest-box, but occasionally they sniffed at it and directed a few digging movements towards the entrance. M2 quite frequently sat on and marked the roof of the nest-box (see below and Fig. 3), but this may not have been related to its use by the females. On June I4 F2 was in a similar state of agitation to that shown previously by Fi, and a few hours later she gave birth to a litter of five pups in the same nest in nest- box i. Shortly after parturition she was already showing an abnormally high level of marking and eliciting sexual approaches from the males, but she responded to the latter aggressively. Both females continued to frequent the nest-box, and it seems likely that they suckled the combined litters. Similar behaviour has been reported in mice by SAYLER &amp; SALMON (I969, I97I), who found that communally reared pups grew faster than those raised by single females. Two days after parturition F2 engaged in a prolonged bout of nest-building, involving rearranging the material in nest-box i and bringing in and shredding additional material from the open area and the burrow. M2 cooperated in gathering material and carrying it to the nest-box entrance. A week later, however, all four animals were found to be engaging in nest-building activities around box 4, and both litters were found inside this box at the end of the session. Members of the first litter were seen outside the nest-box on June 25, aged I9 days. Thereafter they dug their way in and out of the nest-box quite freely, and for much of the time the entrance remained open since the pups made no attempt to close it. The adults rarely interacted with the pups except for occassional nose/nose and nose/genital contacts, but twice M2 picked up a pup and carried it back into the nest-box, and once Fi responded aggressively towards a pup which was attempting to suckle. Within the next few days the pups were seen to dig, forage, eat, drink, shred paper, gnaw the cardboard tube and enter the burrow, but ventral marking and drumming were not ob- served until age 3I days and 46 days respectively. On JulY 4 Fi's litter was found to have been returned to nest-box i, the entrance of which was again blocked. On July 9 and I5 respectively the second litters were born in nest-box 4, but both died, apparently of neglect. The behaviour of the females was strongly reminiscent of rabbits in that the, latter give birth and house their young in special breeding chambers dug</page><page sequence="15">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY ;OF GERBILS 219 as extensions to the main burrow (MYKYTOWYCZ, I968). However nothing similar has been seen in other species of gerbils, and it remains to be seen whether this pattern is characteristic of M. unguiculatus in the wild. Removal of the litter from the original burrow to another has been ob- served in Psammomys obesus by DALY &amp;DALY (1975a), who suggest that it may occur in response to exhaustion of the food supply, or preparatory to the birth of a second litter in the original nest. The latter may explain the second move (on July 9) observed in our study. However neither factor was sufficient to explain some of the moves observed by DALY &amp; DALY, nor the initial move from nest-box I to box 4. External disturbances seem an unlikely cause, since the first move occurred during a weekend when the animals had not been observed. 5. Fighting. This section concerns the occasional outbreaks of severe fighting which led to the death or wvounding of several members of the colony. Agonistic behaviour which occurred during routine encounters or when one female was in oestrus has been discussed above. The study began with five males and three females, of which one male was killed on the second day, and two more within the first week. The first male to be killed was somewhat smaller than the others, and during the first day was excluded from the burrow and took up residence in nest-box I. M2 and M4 were both seen to attack and chase him several times. The other two males vanished during the first week but their bodies were never found and it is not known exactly when they died. After these initial fatalities the colony remained stable until week 6, when F3 was attacked by Fi and F2. After two days of harassment she had taken refuge in nest- box 2, and since she was badly bitten and seemed likely to be killed we removed her from the enclosure. A final outburst of fighting occurred during week I9 when M2 began to attack the first litter of pups (then aged ii weeks), and F2 began to attack Fi. At this point the whole structure of the colony seemed to be breaking down, and we terminated the study. The outbreaks of aggressive behaviour were sudden and violent. Locked fighting and chasing occurred during the first day of hostilities, but by the second day one animal had always ceased fighting and fled whenever its opponent approached. This resulted in prolonged chases which were usually terminated by the victim escaping into the burrow or climbing the fir tree. All the defeated animals suffered biting around the hindquarters, but the fatalities seemed to result from stress or exhaustion rather than from lethal wounds. It is interesting that males were only seen to attack males, and females females, since this was not true of locked fighting in routine encounters (Table 2g). However since males sidled towards females more frequently</page><page sequence="16">220 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOUDAKIS than the reverse and never bit females (Table 2h and i), there is a possibility that in normal agonistic encounters with a female' aggressive behaviour on the part of males is suppressed (cf. SWANSON, I974). INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOUR i. Activities with possible communicatory signi ficance. Ventral marking. The ventral sebaceous gland secretes a waxy musky-smelling substance with which gerbils. of both sexes mark their environment. The response involved is quite conspicuous, and consists of the animal stretching out and lowering its abdomen, and then crawling forward slightly so as to drag the gland along the substrate. Sufficient sebum is deposited for it to be clearly visible on a clean surface such as a sheet of glass. Usually several marks are deposited in rapid succession, but since we found it difficult to agree on a precise observational criterion for a single mark we scored each separate bout of marking regardless of its length. A bout was defined as a group of markings separated, by at least 30 sec from another group. Figure 3 is a map of the enclosure showing the location of all bouts of marking observed during weeks 7 to I7 (excluding days on which a female was in oestrus), and the total number of bouts for each individual. Marks were distributed over the entire enclosure, but were most frequently de- posited on the surface of the earth within the burrow area (see Table 3). (The concentration of marks to the left of nest-box i was deposited on a pile of earth which had been dug out of the sand-box, and was therefore in- cluded as part of the burrow area). There was no clear sex difference in the total number of marks but there was considerable individual variation, the highest scoring animal (M2) marking over twice as frequently as the lowest (Fi). There was, however, a sex difference in the distribution of marks, the males tending to mark more in the open area (Table 3), and on a wider variety of substrates (Table 4). Figure 3 also shows a clear tendency for marks to be deposited at certain specific sites within the general areas, of which the most conspicuous were near the rear wall of the burrow area, between Si and S3, between T2 and S4, and on the mound of earth to the left of NBi. All four animals marked in each of these places frequently, and between them these sites account for 63%o of all observed bouts. All were initially situated on mounds of earth, but the site between Si and S3 later became flattened without any cessation of marking (see Plate 2). Outside the burrow area the most conspicuously</page><page sequence="17">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS A &amp;° ° ° T1 T2 A@ 4 AA AO A AAA B0 o°ooA88MOF _ _ NBi W A A- A-' I B4 :AAA A AAA NBI r AAAAAA IAAAAAI | I *AA - AAAAA L 'A' A 000000 I * ~ -- A A0 El !

The same sites also acted as focal points for activities such as eating, grooming, sleeping, and mutual marking and grooming. M2 often sat and groomed on top of NBI, and M2 and M4 ate and stored food in NB4 and B4 respectively, but these were not exclusive territories and were not defended by the animal which marked them most often.

In one session which illustrates this tendency F2 sandbathed in front of T2 in minute ii, M4 marked there in minute I3, Fi in minute I4, and F2 in minute 46 after an encounter with M2. It thus seems clear that marking is elicited by the existence of recent marks. On the other hand novel unmarked objects also elicit marking (THIESSEN, I968). We tested this by replacing one of the empty bottles with a series of clean ones, and on all such occasions the new bottle was marked within a few hours, whereas the original bottles were marked only rarely. Bottles which had been contaminated with the scent of strange gerbils were also copiously marked shortly after being placed in the enclosure.

In most cases marking occurred during general exploration of the enclosure, but sometimes it was related to encounters with other animals, sandbathing, grooming, digging, eating, drinking or wheel running. We saw no appreciable evidence of chin marking (THIESSEN, YAHR &amp; LINDZEY, I971), or of the the use of urination or defecation as means of olfactory communication. At the end of the study the animals were anaesthetised and their ventral glands measured. The areas of these in mm2 were: M2: I76, M4: 96, Fi: 56, F2: 104, showing a positive correlation with the total marking scores. Sandbathing. We observed I8 instances of sandbathing, distributed about evenly be- tween the four adults. Complete sandbathing consists of scrabbling sand onto, the ventral surface with the forepaws, lowering the ventral surface onto the substrate while stretching and wriggling, rubbing the sides on the substrate, and rolling onto the dorsal surface and wriggling from side to side. Usually only some of these actions were performed, the most frequent being scrabbling and ventral wriggling. Similar movements have been des- cribed in various species of Heteromyidae (EISENBERG, I963b, I967), Ml. persicus (EIBL-EIBESFELDT, I951), and various Saharan gerbils (DALY &amp; DALY, 1975a). On all but two occasions sandbathing occurred at one of the four most heavily marked sites within the burrow area (see above and Fig. 3). Nine instances were immediately preceded or followed by ventral marking, and five occurred at a site at which another animal had sandbathed during the same session. These results strongly support the view that sandbathing serves some olfactory communicatory function, in addition to removing excess oil from the pelage (EISENBERG, i963b, I967). Drumming. Drumming occurred with about equal frequency in all animals, but was relatively rare. In all cases it seemed to be a response to some external disturbance, and was accompanied by attention posturing and retreat to the bur- row area. It usually took place at a burrow entrance, the only exceptions being two occasions on which M2 drummed on top of NBi. Drumming had no con- sistent effect on the behaviour of the rest of the colony, and on two occasions one animal took fright and drummed at high intensity while the others calmly continued their ongoing activities in the immediate vicinity. Thus although it seems clear that drumming can occur as an alarm response, there is no</page><page sequence="20">224 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOOUDAKIS evidence to support the suggestion that it is an alarm signal (see also DALY &amp; DALY, I975a). Since it usually occurs at the burrow entrance it may be a signal for animals which are already below ground to stay there, but this is entirely speculative. Drumming also accompanies sexual behaviour (see P. 2I6), where it presumably has a diifferent function. Other alarm behaviour. During the first weeks of the study the animals were extremely nervous, and considerable care was necessary to avoid frightening them. When an observer entered the room they usually bolted into the burrow, but their latencies to emerge gradually decreased with experience. The animals usually reappeared at each entrance in turn and stood alert for several minutes before finally emerging onto the surface. Alert posturing was often accom- panied by tail waving. M2 was almost always the first to reappear, and seemed generally the least nervous. Sometimes he surveyed the enclosure alone from all the burrow entrances and then disappeared back into the burrow, to emerge a few moments later in the company of the other animals. On such occasions it was difficult to avoid the anthropomorphic conclusion that M2 was acting as an advance guard for the rest of the colony, but once the animals had emerged there was no evidence that any particular one acted as sentry. 2. Burrow maintenance. Digging. Digging accounted for a large proportion of the animals' active time, and there was evidence of fresh digging every morning when the burrow was mapped. Tunnels were initially dug at several points around the edge of the sand-box, leading in towards the center and joining with one another under- ground, but during the course of the study the entrances gradually moved inwards until they eventually formed a circle about 50 cm in diameter between stones I to 4 (see Plate 2). The number of entrances varied from two to eight. Excavation at the end of the experiment revealed a central nest chamber located below the heavily marked mound between Si and S3, and containing a nest of finely shredded paper, straw and leaves. The general plan of the burrow conformed to the field observations of BANNIKOV (I954). The animals dug methodically for long periods of time, usually orienting themselves towards an existing burrow entrance. Digging would begin on the pile of earth outside the entrance, and would continue as the animal gradually worked its way into the tunnel. Repetition of this process seems</page><page sequence="21">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 225 to have been responsible for the gradual inward migration of the tunnel entrances. A few digging movements were also usually executed whenever an animal entered the burrow in the course of other activities. Apart from enlarging existing tunnels the animals dug mainly beneath the trees and marker stones. On a number of occasions when a completely fresh site was dug the animal was seen to extensively mark the freshly dug earth, and others subsequently sniffed the mark and dug in the same place. The animals dug so vigorously that they repeatedly destroyed existing excavations, and their behaviour did not give the impressilon that they were working towards the realisation of any consistent plan. Digging therefore seems best regarded as an activity which is self-sustaining, rather than one which is directed towards a more distant goal such as the construction of a burrow of particular shape (ROPER, 1976). Nest-building. All animals were seen to carry and shred material, the frequencies being somewhat higher in the males than in the females. Sometimes two or more animals engaged in nest-building activities simultaneoously at the same site (see p. 2I8). The preferred material was paper, but straw and leaves were also used. 3. Maintenance activities. Eating and hoarding. Finding and consuming food were probably the most frequent activities after digging. Of the foods available sunflower seeds and wheat seemed to be preferred, but the chow was also eaten, and the animals sometimes nibbled the leaves of the Oregon grape bush and caught and ate insects. Seeds and grain were eaten where they were found, but chow pellets were usually carried back to the burrow area, or into a bottle or nest-box, prior to con- sumption. Hoarding was rare, but animals were occasionally seen to take food into the burrow, and also to carry food out of the burrow and eat it on the surface. Gerbils are reported to hoard large amounts of food in natural conditions (BANNIKOV, I954), but very little was found when the burrow was excavated at the end of the study. Eating frequently attracted approach and investigation by other animals, who sometimes attempted to take the food. Usually the eater simply turned away and continued its meal, but sometimes pellets of chow were allowed to change hands. Fighting over food was never observed, and sometimes a single pellet was handed backwards and forwards between two individuals several times during a single encounter.</page><page sequence="22">226 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOUDAKIS M2, M4 and Fi were occasionally observed to mark pellets of food which they appeared to have finished eating but had not completely consumed (see Table 4). Other animals subsequently approached these pellets, sniffed them, and sometimes marked or ate them, indicating that marking did not elicit avoidance. Drinking. In some circumstances gerbils can survive without free water (BOICE &amp; ARLEDGE, I968; ARRINGTON &amp; AMMERMAN, I969), but they drink it if it is available. In our study all animals drank from bottles I and 2 with about equal frequency but never from bottle 3, perhaps because they preferred the cover provided by the mouse cages. Grooming. All animals engaged in frequent bouts of grooming of varying duration and intensity. These seemed usually to occur at the heavily marked sites in the burrow area, and in the case of M2 on top of nest-box I. 4. Stereotyped behaviour. Wheel running. The running wheel was intended primarily to give continuous automated information about the animals' diurnal activity rhythm. THIESSEN, LINDZEY et al. (I968) found that wheel running in gerbils in restricted conditions was almost entirely nocturnal, with a single peak early in the dark phase of the cycle, and STUTZ (I972) found that jiggle-cage activity was nocturnal but bimodal, with peaks at the beginning and end of the dark phase. Both studies conflict with the field observations of TANIMOTO ( I943) and BANNIKOV (I954), who report that the species is active both day and night. Figure 4 shows the mean number of wheel revolutions per hour as a func- tion of time of day over the course of the study. More running occurred during the light phase than during the dark, and the major peak was just after mid-day, with a secondary peak at dawn. The diurnal rhythm under- went reversal when the light cycle was changed during week 3, indicating that light was the effective cue, and it is unlikely that it was influenced by the observation schedule since it remained the same during a week in which no-one entered the experimental room. The activity rhythm of our animals thus resembled that of gerbils in the wild (insofar as information is available), but differed from those obtained in laboratory studies largely in that there was a high level of diurnal activity.</page><page sequence="23">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 227 Dark Dawn Light Dusk Dark 40 - 30 - 20 - 10 0 0 6 12 18 24 Hours Fig. 4. Mean number of wheel revolutions per hour over weeks 7 to I7, as a function of time of day. A possible explanation of this difference lies in the fact that our gerbils, like wild ones, were able to retreat into a dark burrow during the day, whereas in the laboratory studies they were unable to escape from the light. Since, as has been suggested on the basis of other evidence. (KAVANAU, i967), animals which are active at night may find inescapable bright light aversive, it is possible that absence of a burrow enhances nocturnality in laboratory conditions. However other factors cannot be excluded, such as the presence of so,cial companions, and gradual versus rectangular switching of light at 'dawn' and 'dusk' (KAVANAU, i969). We are currently attempting to deter- mine which if any of these factors is relevant. It also remains to be, seen why nocturnal activity was unimodal in the study by THIESSEN et al. but bimodal in our study and in that of STUTZ. There were also differences in the amount and form of running between the present study and ones carried out in more restricted conditions. Con- fined isolated gerbils run at speeds Of Up to 2,000 revolutions per hour, and may exceed 20,000 revolutions per day (RoPER, unpublished results), but in the present study the four animals together never exceeded 5o revolutions per hour, or a few thousand per day. This seemed to reflect differences in the consistency of running, in that the confined gerbils ran for hours on end with only brief pauses, whereas our animals entered the wheel only rarely and never ran more than a few revolutions before jumping out again. Thus it seems that in the present case running occurred merely as part of general exploration of the environment, and never developed into the stereotyped and highly time-consuming activity that is characteristic of caged animals. '5</page><page sequence="24">228 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. P`OLIOUDAKIS All the animals were seen to run, and there was no evidence that running reflected the existence of a dominance order (DE KoCK &amp; ROHN, I971). Other stereotyped activities. Gerbils in captivity may spend large amounts of time shredding paper (GLICKMAN, FRIED &amp; MORRISON, I967; GLICKMAN, I973), scrabbling in empty bottles or in the corner of the cage, or gnawing wood, cardboard or the cage bars (ROPER, unpublished observations). In the present study such activities were relatively uncommon, which argues well for the naturalness of the environment. Paper shredding was usually performed in conjunction with other nest-building activities, though occasionally animals would pick up fragments of paper, shred them, and drop them again. Gnawing of the cardboard tube was more common, but only occupied animals for short periods of time. Scrabbling in the empty bottles was never seen, but towards the end of the study F2 developed the habit of scrabbling in the corner of one of the water bottle cages. No information is available concerning the time budget of M. unguiculatus in the field, but studies of related species suggest that a large proportion of the active time may be spent ranging or foraging (DALY &amp; DALY, I975b). However in the present study digging occupied far more time than wheel running, which might be expected to act as a substitute for ranging. Scrab- bling may be a substitute for digging, since similar motor patterns are involved. DISCUSSION In this section we consider the implications of the results for theories of dominance, marking and sociability in the gerbil. I. Dominance. On the basis of studies of aggression between gerbils in confined conditions a number of authors have postulated the existence of dominance orders, and of a positive correlation between dominance and ventral marking (e.g. THIESSEN, I968, I973; NYBY, THIESSEN &amp; WALLACE, I970; OWEN &amp; LINDZEY, I97I; GALLUP &amp; WAITE, I970). These studies all involved encounters between strange animals, and therefore do not necessarily imply the existence of dominance orders within a stable social group. However since such orders have been claimed to occur in rats (BARNETT, I963; BAENNINGER, I966; EWER, I971) and mice (UHLRICH, I938), it seems worthwhile to examine the evidence for dominance in the present study. The concept of dominance is only useful insofar as it enables the prediction</page><page sequence="25">I3EHAVIOIJR OF A COLONY OF GERkILS 229 of a wide variety of social interactions (RICHARDS, 1974). Of those measures of dominance which have been used in studies of other species, the following are applicable to the present study: approach behaviour, agonistic behaviour, priority to incentives, grooming, marking and sexual success. The question then is whether any of these aspects of behaviour suggested the existence of a dominance order within our group of animals, and to what extent they were correlated. Data from routine encounters in general failed to support the dominance hypothesis, in that they suggested sex differences rather than individual differences. M2 engaged in more encounters than any other animal, but he approached other animals propor- tionately less than M4. Fi elicited less sidling from other animals than did F2, which is of some interest since sidling has been claimed to be a submission posture (REYNIERSE, I97I). However Fi also sidled less to other animals than did F2, which is inconsistent with the view that she was more submissive. Mutual grooming has been used as an index of dominance in primates (CRAWFORD, I94I), rats (SPIGEL, TRIVETT &amp; FRASER, I972) and mice (LONG, I972), but in our study the only suggestion of a consistent individual difference in this activity was that Fi was groomed less than F2 by the males. M4 and Fi were marked less than M2 and F2, but in view of the rarity of marking no great significance can be attached to this result. Furthermore M4 and Fi were the more submissive animals by other criteria (see below), so this result is the reverse of what would be expected if mutual marking were a sign of dominance, as assumed by RIEDER &amp; LUMIA (I973). Ventral marking of the substrate did show large individual differences, the highest marker being M2 and the lowest Fi, and gland sizes were correlated with these scores (cf. THIESSEN, i968; THIESSEN &amp; LINDZEY, I970). M2 distributed his marks more widely than M4, but there was no difference between the females in this measure, nor any evidence that areas marked principally by one animal were defended by that animal or avoided by others. Agonistic behaviour was rare during the normal life of the colony and of- fered no evidence of a dominance order, but in the occasional outbreaks of severe fighting some animals did become clearly dominant over others. Fight- ing was restricted to pairs of animals of the same sex, indicating again that sex differences were an important determinant of the course of social encoun- ters, but the only observed instance of a single animal defeating another was when F2 became aggressive towards Fi in week i8. Clear domination of one animal by another was also evident when a female was in oestrus, when M2 consistently attacked and chased M4, thereby obtaining almost exclusive access to the female. We carried out no formal tests of priority to incentives, but on a number of occasions one animal was observed to take food from another. There were no conspicuous individual differences in this behaviour, it was not accom- panied by visible threat, and on a number of occasions was exhibited by both animals alternately during a single encounter, so again there was no evidence of dominance.</page><page sequence="26">230 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOUDAKIS The results therefore suggest that if the concept of dominance was applic- able to the colony at all it was specific to situations in which a female was in oestrus, in which case it involved only males, or to situations in which there was severe fighting. Since the latter were probably attributable to overcrowding (see below), and would have been accompanied by migration had this been possible, they are probably not relevant to normal behaviour. There was some evidence of a positive correlation between dominance in these situations and marking rate throughout the study, but it was certainly not the case that marking was confined to a single dominant animal as in rabbits (MYKYTOWYCZ, I968) and certain other species (RALLS, I97I), or as in encounters between strange gerbils. Finally, it should be emphasised that the discovery of dominance orders in the laboratory does not necessarily mean that they exist in the field (ROWELL, I972). 2. Marking. Studies of ventral marking have been methodologically biassed by THIESSEN'S (I968) finding that marking is readily elicited in male gerbils in an open field provided with a number of short Plexiglas pegs. Marking is known to occur in the home cage, but is generally believed to be quite infrequent. In the present study, however, we saw an average of almost one bout per hour, suggesting that marking of familiar ground is facilitated by the presence of social companions, a suitable substrate, or a relatively un- restricted environment. Our results also showed that marking was confined largely to the burrow area, that the preferred substrate was earth rather than objects such as branches or stones, and that marks tended to be de- posited in close spatial and temporal contiguity. However there is a possibility that some of these effects were confounded, in that substrate preference could have been linked to spatial distribution. Finally we observed high levels of marking in the females, which is contrary to the results of open-field studies (THIESSEN, BLUM &amp; LINDZEY, I970; THIESSEN, Ow,VEN &amp; LINDZEY, I971). This was not solely attributable to the hormonal condition of the females (WALLACE, OWEN &amp; THIESSEN, I973), since they marked at high rates before the onset of their first pregnancies. THIESSEN and his coworkers have repeatedly maintained that ventral marking is territorial, and is concerned with the "defense of property" (THIESSEN, I973), but the evidence for this view is negligible. On the contrary, our results and those of BARAN (1973; BARAN &amp; GLICKMAN, I970) suggest that fresh marks elicit detailed investigation and counter- marking rather than avoidance. In summary our results suggest that marking in the home environment</page><page sequence="27">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 23I occurs predominately in conjunction with 'low arousal' activities such as exploration, rather than in 'high arousal' situations such as agonistic encoun- ters (see JOHNSTON, 1975a). In this respect it resembles the marking of canids (MECH, 1970; PETERS &amp; MECH, in press) and felids (LEYHAUSEN, 197I; SCHALLER, I972), rather than of hamsters (JOHNSTON, 1975a, b, c) and other species (RALLS, 1971). DALY &amp; DALY (1975b) suggest a similar conclusion on the basis of field studies of Saharan gerbils. A possible alternative function of marking is to promote colony cohesion. The activities of marking and sandbathing on previously marked spots, and of mutual marking and grooming, might all have the effect of spreading a colony odour consisting of a combination of the individual odours, and this might serve to inhibit aggression within the colony. There is evidence from other sources that aggressive behaviour is related to olfactory cues (GINSBURG &amp; BRAUD, I970; NORRIS &amp; ADAMS, I972a, b, c; WECHKIN &amp; BREUER, 1974), and that gerbils can distinguish one another by scent (DAGG &amp; WINDSOR, 197I; HALPIN, I974). However it is not difficult to suggest other functions such as that the heavily marked spots designate 'safe' areas within the vicinity of the burrow, or act as landmarks to tell the colony members that they are near home (RALLS, I97I; PETERS &amp; MECH, in press); and it is also possible that marking has some inter-group function such as to permit time-sharing of territory (DALY &amp; DALY, 1975b). Finally, the observation that females mark at a very high rate during oestrus suggests that a sexual function should not be discounted. 3. Socitability. Our study shows that a small number of adult gerbils can peacefully coexist for at least a few months, sharing the same burrow and resources. It is there- fore possible that in natural conditions gerbils nest in pairs, as suggested by SCHWENTKER (1972), or in small groups. Unfortunately there is insufficient knowledge of social organisation in the wild to verify this hypothesis, but TANIMOTO (I943) and BANNIKOV (I95) both suggest that M. unguicu- latus is at least to some extent social. The majority of other species of Gerbillinae which have been studied are solitary (DALY &amp; DALY, I975b), but Tatera indica appears to nest in pairs or small groups (PRAKASH, I962; PRAKASH &amp; JAIN, I97I). It seems likely that the fighting which occurred at the beginning and end of the study was a response to overcrowding. The fatalities of the first week reduced the number of animals from eight to five, after which th.e colony remained stable until week i8 except for the attacks on F3 in week 6. In week i8 the first litter of pups was probably reaching sexual maturity</page><page sequence="28">232 T. J. ROPER &amp; E. POLIOUDAKIS (NORRIS &amp; ADAMS, I974), thus bringing the number of adults back up to seven. The failure of the females to care for their second litters also supports the view that the colony was excessively populated by this time (cf. CALHOUN, i962a, b). The sudden attack on F3 is less easily explained, but may be attributable to the fact that the other two females were then pregnant. In conclusion our results, while offering some hints concerning the func- tion of marking and the type of social organisation in M. unguiculatus, leave many questions still open. These will only be satisfactorily answered by more detailed studies of the behaviour of the species in natural conditions. SUMMARY We observed the behaviour of a colony of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) for i8 weeks, in an enclosure provided with facilities for burrowing, nest-building, foraging, wheel-running and other behaviour. Records were taken of both social and individual activities, and in particular of activities occurring during encounters between pairs of individuals. i. The colony originally consisted of eight animals, but severe fighting rapidly reduced the numbers to two males and two females. The colony then remained stable until week I8, when an adult male attacked the offspring of one of the females. Fighting was never observed between animals of opposite sex. The fighting was probably due to overcrowding, and suggests that in natural conditions gerbils do not nest in groups of more than a few adults. 2. Routine encounters between individuals revealed a number of sex differences, but few conspicuous individual differences. Agonistic behaviour was rare, and the obser- vations gave little evidence for the existence of a dominance order. 3. When a female was in oestrus one male consistently attacked and chased the other, and consequently gained almost exclusive access to the female. The sequence of mating responses is described, and it is suggested that genital sniffing by the male enhances the receptivity of the female. Ventral marking by the female and drumming by the male occurred at unusually high levels during mating. 4. Each female produced two litters, but only the first two survived. The litters were dropped and the young housed in a nest-box outside the normal colony burrow, the entrance to which was kept blocked. Both litters were carried to another nest-box in the second week after parturition, and carried back again prior to the birth of the second litters, but the reasons for this behaviour were unclear. The males assisted in nest- building activities, but never entered the maternal nest-box. We suggest that the failure of the females to care for their second litters was due to overcrowding. 5. Ventral marking occurred at a high rate, and in conjunction with various activities. Marks were deposited over the entire enclosure and on a variety of substrates, but were concentrated at four main sites on mounds of earth near the burrow. There were no sex differences in total number of marks, but the males tended to distribute their marks more widely. Individual differences in amount of marking were correlated with differences in gland size, and with the outcome of aggressive encounters during mating and the occasional fighting. There was a strong tendency for fresh marks to elicit counter-marking by the same or another animal, but novel clean objects were also marked within a short time of being placed in the colony. There was no evidence that marked objects or areas were avoided by other animals or defended by the marker, and we suggest that marking is not primarily territorial in function. 6. Mutual marking, mutual grooming and sandbathing all occurred at the four most heavily marked sites near the burrow. We suggest that these activities, and the tendency</page><page sequence="29">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 233 for animals to counter-mark at specific sites, might serve to distribute a colony odour consisting of the odors of the individuals, and that this might reduce intra-colony ag- gression. We found no evidence that mutual marking or grooming reflected a dominance order. Drumming of the substrate occurred as an alarm response, but we saw no evidence of its use as an alarm signal. 7. The most frequent individual activity was digging. The burrow, which was in- habited by all the adults, consisted of from two to eight tunnels leading in towards a central nest of shredded paper, straw and leaves. The tunnels were repeatedly cleared and enlarged, and were often destroyed by digging at other locations. Freshly dug earth was often marked by the digger, and this seemed to elicit marking and digging by other animals. 8. Wheel running occurred only at a low rate, and did not develop a stereotyped character, but was performed by all animals. Contrary to expectations based on labora- tory studies the majority of running occurred during the light phase of the cycle, and this was when the animals were most often active in the general sense. We suggest that gerbils are probably active day and night in natural conditions, and that the enhanced nocturnality shown in laboratory studies may be due to the lack of a dark burrow. 9. Other stereotyped activities such as shredding paper, gnawing and scrabbling were rare. IO. The results are summarized and discussed in relation to theories of dominance, ventral marking and sociability, and attention is drawn to the need for more field studies of behaviour in this species.

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Wir beobachteten i8 Wochen das Verhalten einer Kolonie von mongolischen Gerbeln (Meriones unguiculatus) in einem Gehege, das Gelegenheit zum Eingraben, Nestbauen, Stobern, Radlaufen und anderen Tatigkeiten bot. Wir machten Notizen iiber Gruppen- und Einzeltatigkeiten, insbesondere iiber die Benehmensweise und das Verhalten von Paaren von Einzeltieren zueinander. i. Die Kolonie bestand urspriinglich aus acht Tieren, aber durch heftiges Kampfen wurde diese Anzahl bald auf zwei mannliche und zwei weibliche Tiere reduziert. Es blieb dann bei dieser Anzahl bis zu Woche i8, als ein Mannchen das Junge einer der beiden Weibchen angriff. Zu keinem Zeitpunkt bemerkten wir Kampfe zwischen Tieren entgegengesetzten Geschlechtes. Wir vermuten, dass die Angriffe auf tYber- v6lkerung zuriickzufiihren sind und dass daher, unter natiirlichen Bedingungen, Gerbel sich nur in kleineren Gruppen, die aus einigen erwachsenen Tieren bestehen, nieder- lassen. 2. Routinebegegnungen zwischen Einzeltieren deuteten auf eine Anzahl von ge- schlechtlichen Verschiedenheiten hin, aber offenbarten nur wenige, individuelle, Ver- schiedenheiten. Es herrschte wenig Angriffslust und wir fanden wenig Beweis dafiir, dass irgendeine Herrschaftsordnung bestand. 3. Wenn ein Weibchen begattungsfahig war, griff ein minnliches Tier stindig das andere mannliche an und erlangte dadurch ungehinderten Zugang zum weiblichen Tier. Die Reaktion der Tiere zueinander vor der Begattung wird hier beschrieben, und wir nehmen an, dass das Beschnuppern der ano-genitalen Region die Empfanglichkeit des Weibchens erh6ht. Geruchsmarkierung von Seiten des Weibchens und Trommeln des Minnchens fanden wahrend dieses Vorganges in gesteigertem Masse statt. 4. Jedes Weibchen warf zweimal Junge, aber nur die ersten beiden Jungtiere blieben am Leben. Nach dem ersten Wurf wurden die Jungen in einem Nestkasten ausserhalb des normalen Baues untergebracht, zu welchem der Eingang versperrt gehalten wurde.</page><page sequence="33">BEHAVIOUR OF A COLONY OF GERBILS 237 In der zweiten Woche nach dem Wurf wurden beide Jungen in einem anderen Nestkasten untergebracht, aber vor dem zweiten Wurf des Weibchens wieder in den ersten Kasten zuruckgebracht. Den Grund dieses Verhaltens konnten wir nicht ganz klaren. Die Ma.nnchen half en beim Nestbauen, aber betraten den weiblichen Nestkasten nie. Es wird angenommen, dass die Unfiahigkeit der Weibchen, fur die zweitgeworfenen Jungen zu sorgen, wiederum auf Uberv6lkerung zuriickzufiihren ist. 5. Geruchsmarkierung f and in erh6htem Masse und zusammen mit verschiedenen anderen Titigkeiten statt. Geruchsspuren wurden auf den jeweiligen Unterlagen und in dem ganzen Gehege hinterlassen aber in konzentrierter Form an vier Hauptpunkten auf Erdhiigeln in der Nahe des Baues. Hierbei wurden keine Geschlechtsunterschiede festgestellt, aber die Miinnchen verteilen ihre Spuren im allgemeinen mehr weitver- breitet. Die Mengen der Markierung waren individuell unterschiedlich, was wohl von der Gr6sse der Driusen und von gelegentlichem Kampfen abhangt und davon, ob wahrend des Begattungsprozesses Kimpfen stattgefunden hat. Frische Markierungen reizten das gleiche Tier oder ein anderes im erh6hten Masse zu Gegenmarkierungen an, aber auch neue unmarkierte Objekte wurden kurze Zeit nachdem sie ins Gehege gelegt wurden, markiert. Wir fanden keinen Beweis dafiir, dass markierte Objekte oder Stellen ent- weder von anderen Tieren vermieden oder vom markierenden Tier verteidigt wurden, und dies lasst vermuten, dass die Markierung nicht erstlich eine gebietsbegrenzende Funktion hat. 6. Gegenseitiges Markieren, gegenseitiges Putzen und Sandbaden fanden an den starkstens markierten Stellen in der Nihe des Baues statt. Wir nehmen, an, dass diese Tatigkeiten und die Neigung zu Gegenmarkierungen an bestimmten Stellen dazu dienen k6nnten, den Geruch der Kolonie, der aus den jeweiligen Eigengeriichen der Einzeltiere besteht, zu verbreiten und dass somit jegliche interne Angriffslust ver- mindert wird. Wiederum gab es kein Beweis dafur, dass gegenseitiges Markieren oder Putzen das Bestehen irgendeiner Herrschaftsordnung vermuten lassen. Trommeln des Bodens ereignete sich nur zum Alarmgeben, aber hier wiederum fanden wir keinen Beweis, dass dies wirklich als Alarmsignal angesehen wurde. 7. Graben als Einzelaktivitat fand am allerhaufigsten statt. Der Bau, der von allen erwachsenen Tieren bewohnt wurde, bestand aus zwei bis acht Gangen, die zu einem zen- tralen Nest fiihrten, das mit zerfetztem Papier, Halmen und Blattern angefullt war. Die Ginge wurden wiederholt gesaubert und erweitert und des 6fteren zerst6rt, indem an anderen Platzen gegraben wurde. Frischgegrabene Erde wurde wiederholt vom graben- den Tier markiert und dies wiederum reizte andere Tiere zum Markieren und Graben an. 8. Radlaufen wurde nur wenig betrieben und fiihrte nicht zu einer stereotypen Charakterisierung, aber wiederum wurde es hier von allen Tieren betrieben. Im Gegensatz zu Beobachtungen im Laboratorium fand Radlaufen hauptsachlich dann statt, wenn die Tiere im allgemeinen haupttatig waren, und dies fiihrt zu der Annahme, dass sie wahrscheinlich unter natiirlichen Bedingungen Tag und Nacht tatig sind, und dass die erh6hte Nachttitigkeit, die im Labor festgestellt wurde, auf das Fehlen eines dunklen Baues zuriickzufiihren ist. 9. Andere stereotype Beschaftigungen wie Papierzerfetzen, Nagen und Scharren fanden selten statt. IO. Die Resultate werden hier zusammengefasst und er6rtert in Beziehung auf Theorien uiber Herrschaftsordnung, Geruchsmarkierung und Gesellschaftlichkeit, und es wird darauf hingewiesen, dass noch viel mehr Untersuchungen iuber die Benehmens- weise dieser Spezies unter freien Bedingungen notig sind.</page></plain_text>
