Plainview (New York): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. $180.00. xv + 843 p; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-87969-497-1. 1997. "What three names did Howard Temin use for re- troviruses. Hint: none of them caught on" (p 809). This edition is a comprehensive compilation of admirably current information, including well-writ- ten, thoughtful descriptions of retroviral replica- tion strategies, detailed analyses of the variety of complex viral-host interactions, and updated ap- pendixes with database referrals. It is dedicated to Howard Temin, who pioneered the hypothesis that retroviruses must transfer their genetic information into DNA. Ironically, this concept, which struggled a decade for acceptance, is now recognized as an underlying feature of several spectacular revela- tions of modern molecular genetics. The book offers something for everyone: The young student of retrovirology is treated to a mix- ture of historical perspective interwined disarm- ingly with in-depth descriptions and analyses. The proffered perspective does more than relate a series of key discoveries: it attempts to associate them, the responses to them, and the preceding inklings of the ideas into a framework of developments that shaped the field. The intellectual context offers op- portunities for the entrenched retrovirologist to re- view old findings from a refreshed perspective. And even retro-veterans may find themselves challenged by the "retrotrivia" quiz and crossword puzzle which conclude the book. Although Retroviruses is a compilation of review articles written by several contributors (some repre- senting three generations of mentor-trainee), the subject matter is very well integrated and the consis- tent writing style makes this book very easy and en- joyable to read. The book is divided into two parts. The first seven chapters focus primarily on viral structure, function, and replication. The second part (five chapters) deals mainly with aspects of virus-host interactions. A short section (appropriately entitled Intermezzo) marks the division in the book. This section is some- what anthropomorphic in perspective, but never- theless serves the editors' intent. Each chapter be- gins with a brief yet helpful overview, Chapters that describe particularly complex phenomena divide the subject matter into subsections whose depth in- creases as the chapter progresses. Illustrations are informative and there are striking color graphics throughout. The cited literature is reasonably ex- haustive and, although recent crystallographic analyses of important retroviral proteins have made some sections out-of-date already, there is worth- while discussion of several indirect approaches that complement the structural findings. This edition outlines well the series of far-reach- ing mini-scientific revolutions that have emerged from the study of retroviruses. The book will be of immense value not only to students, teachers and researchers within the field, but also to investigators in the broadly related disciplines of cancer genetics and cell biology.
