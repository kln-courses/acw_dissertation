<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cancer Research Sir,?Much of the recent work on cancer is concerned with the recognition, distribution, and mode of action of carcinogens. This stems from the publication of Percival? Pott's views on chimney sweep's cancer set out in his article " Cancer Scroti."1 I think it untrustworthy and, in the light of what has been done since his time, inaccurate. Yet it has continued immensely to affect subsequent investiga tion, largely because of the fact that cancer could be pro duced in animals by the application of some substances externally. I believe it is a fallacy to assume that human creatures will react in the same way as animals living under duress. Inevitably work has been confined to laboratory animals, but these are often wild creatures who have to&gt; submit to captivity, with all its abnormalities and gross disturbance of their normal sexual instincts, and periodically to forcible restraint while their skin is painted with the substance being investigated. Little is known of the affec tive life of laboratory animals, and one is bound to think of them in anthropomorphic ways. But there can be no doubt that they may suffer what we understand by the con ception of stress, and it is not inconceivable that, if "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune " become insup portable, they find a flight into illness, and death is their only defence.</page><page sequence="2">Oct. 5, 1957 CORRESPONDENCE M British 825 _____ Medical Journal It happens we have a countless number of unsuspecting human guinea-pigs to act as controls. The best-known carcinogen, as might be expected historically, is coal tar and its derivatives. Liquor picis carbonis has been shown to be carcinogenic, and yet it is used as a paint or ointment in countless numbers of patients suffering from certain skin diseases. Most dermatologists have ignored this, as many smokers have disregarded the flesh-creeping warnings about their habits. I do not know of any reported case of cancer following the human use of liq. picis carb. Many will require experimental evidence. If this interpretation is correct I think it can be provided. A large number of mice should be divided into equal groups living under identical conditions. One group is treated with a well established carcinogen, the other with an inert substance, using a modification of the modern double-check technique. Allowance should be made for spontaneous growths, though this would not be easy. If in the result only a few developed cancer after the inert application this would be immensely significant. Ideally the many mice should run into many score. In examining a secretion for T.B. a few negative results mean little, while a single positive is conclusive. But I do not suppose any established research organiza tion will take the suggestion seriously. However, the tobacco manufacturers may take a different view and arrange for some of the research bodies they have set up to " try and see," as John Hunter might have said. They would be much concerned with their own interests, but a large number would be concerned in the removal of " cancer scroti," and all that has flowed from it, from the position it has so long enjoyed.?I am, etc., London.
