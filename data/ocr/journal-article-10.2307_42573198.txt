<plain_text><page sequence="1">Naturalist Humor in Will Cuppy's How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes Al Castle Naturalism has been widely examined for its historical origins and philosophical impact on American writing in the first thirty-odd years of the twentieth century. Only recently, however, has critical attention turned to the potential of naturalism for humor.1 The now little read Will Cuppy (1884-1949) was a minor American humorist who was aware of the comedic possibilities inherent in the natu- ralistic assumptions about man and the universe. Many of these possibilities were put to use in How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes (1931). An examination of this brief work reflects both on Cuppy's real abilities as a comic writer and on the humor that can arise from the often dire world of naturalism. The naturalistic image of man, often associated with Dreiser, London, and Dos Passos, was well suited to an age dominated by the scientific metaphors of process, survival of the fittest, historicism, and materialism. The key naturalist assumptions included deter- minism through instinct, heredity, or environment, the indifference of the universe to man, and the view that man is an animal that is part of nature. Instead of rational and spiritual beings anchored between God and nature on the Chain of Being, "men are but phenomena and the conditions of phenomena."2 To Cuppy, man is made up of the worst aspects of this meaningless, indifferent universe, and he has worsened his condition by creating an arti- ficially irrational, brutal, and complex environment.3 Arrogant in his exiguous reasoning capacity, he has lost the honesty, self-acceptance, and skepticism necessary for happiness in a naturalistic universe. By exploiting the humorous aspects of this circumstance, Cuppy may have hoped for a restoration of balance between human striving and actual human possibility. He was not, in any case, the first naturalist to understand the need for some comic relief to lighten the dire perceptions of his philosophy.4 One notable element of humor in How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes is the traditional one of surprise. The element involves an instantaneous breaking up of thè usual course of thought or action. Specifically, Cuppy builds a description, often in mock-objective style, of an animal and then suddenly reveals the violence and waste 330</page><page sequence="2">in nature or the similarity of the animal to man. The surprise "twist" in his narrative denies us the humor of superiority while unmasking romantic notions about nature's order and beauty. In typical natu- ralist style, he views nature in the raw as inherently nasty and brutish with a kind o£ blind determinism for survival commanding all its members. Thus, Cuppy describes the zebra as "a small striped Horse or Donkey. He lives in Africa. The Zebra is striped all over so that the Lion can see him and eat him." And, "the Mountain Zebra inhabits mountainous regions and limps on the off side. He is black and white. Burchell's Zebra is beige and brown and looks better in pink. The Quagga is now extinct because he was such an ass."5 In describing the crow, Cuppy says that "Aristotle describes the Crow as chaste. In some departments of knowledge Aristotle was too innocent for his own good. I am frequently asked the meaning of caw! caw! caw! It means nothing whatever."6 Mocking the anthropomorphic assumption that the wren is an affectionate, loyal bird, Cuppy finds that "you can prove that a Wren loves you by forcing his paws around your neck, laying his head on your shoulder, and repeating, 'Oh how he loves me!' If he bites you try another Wren."7 Even more devastating to the view of a pacific, benign, teleological nature is the sudden disclosure that "the Wren has a stubby tail and a vicious expression. His sweet bubbling song means that he has just punctured the eggs of a Chipping Sparrow and ruined the home of a Yellow Warbler and is going out to murder a couple of baby Titmice."8 In a footnote to this observation he pans a clergyman who reported that wrens once cared for orphaned titmice. He elaborates on the humor of the nature lover who blinds himself to the reality of struggle in the natural order: I know that for many of my fellow creatures existence without our Feathered Friends would be a living hell. I guess I'm just different. If, in his meanderings through field and wood, one of these persons encounters a Pewee, it thrills him through and through. It really does. For him that day is a red-letter day . . . instinct with something sacred and beautiful that no one . . . can take away. Personally, whenever I meet one of the darn things I can say and do all that is needful in the time it takes me to pick up a brick.9 Feeling no "deep philosophic vein" in nature, Cuppy can ridicule Wordsworthian observations of a transparent, friendly, healing world. A second element of humor employed by Cuppy is the broader one of incongruity. Incongruous humor generally arises from dis- jointed, ill-suited pairings of ideas or situations or presentations of ideas or situations that are divergent from habitual customs or 331</page><page sequence="3">expectations.10 The naturalistic perspective of Cuppy finds a humorous disjunction between man's traditional expectation that he is superior to the natural order and that his actions are free, and the reality of man's animality and determinism. Repeatedly, Cuppy's bestiary finds animals acting like man and vice versa. Man's pride, once supported by a complex scientific-theological superstructure, is found to be uncalled for in light of twentieth-century anthropology. Cuppy's only direct attempt to ridicule and deflate our posturing is made in the mock-objective, detached account of "The Modern Man." Exploiting the incongruity between human self-conception and our actual characteristics, Cuppy finds that the Modern Man or Nervous Wreck is the highest of all mammals because anyone can see that he is. There are about 2,000,000,000 Modern Men or too many. Modern Man's highly developed brain has made him what he is and you know what he is. The development of his brain is caused by his upright or bipedal position, as in the Penguin, the Dinosaur, and other extinct reptiles. Modern Man has been called the Talking Animal because he talks more than any three other animals at random. He has also been called the Reasoning Animal but there may be a catch in this. The fissure of Sylvius and the fissure of Rolando enable him to argue in circles. His main pursuits in the order named are murder, robbery, kid-napping, body-snatching, barratry, nepotism, arson, and mayhem. This is known as the Good, the True, and the Beautiful. ... All Modern Men are descended from a Wormlike creature but it shows more on some people. Modern Man will never become extinct if the Democrats can help it.11 Thus, for Cuppy, the pretensions of extra-natural superiority of the "species" Modern Man are found to be both a sham and a cause for some of his misery. By giving his pre-modern men and "other assorted animals" human characteristics, Cuppy can in an indirect way mock our self- proclaimed free will. Thus, the Cro-Magnons were determined "by chromosomes, genes, hormones, and blastomeres. They were so wonderful that they were called Homo sapiens after us."12 After describing the moral reputation of the water ouzel, Cuppy finds that their "morality" is only an adaptation to a challenging environ- ment.13 He further ridicules those who praise the sagacity of the parrot by revealing that its "tendency to talk Varies inversely as the square of his gray matter" and that the vaunted "speech" is a mere response in the stimulus-response chain.14 In his description of the "dignified" and "cute" penguin, he finds that Male Penguins are unfaithful up to an advanced age, a phenomenon sometimes attributed to the sea air. Penguins are well-meaning birds with little or no notion of what is going on. Only the expert can tell a 332</page><page sequence="4">live Penguin from a stuffed one. It is probable that most Penguins are stuffed. Some people nearly die laughing at Penguins.15 Cuppy further deplores, in his examination of the woodpecker, that "an insect cannot feel safe even under the bark of a tree. Mother Nature has equipped the Woodpecker to get in there and get him, and at the same time has equipped the insect to stay there and be eaten."16 Cuppy finds that the real reasons for "cute," anthropomor- phic behavior in animals lie in the blind drive for survival, comfort, replication, and rest. Thus, the gnu is "curious" as "he climbs to the tops of Ant-hills looking for objects to be curious about"17; the beaver is "industrious" and possessed of an attractive work ethic because he has to labor to survive, "not because he believes that hard work per se will make him a better Beaver - the Beaver may be dumb, but he is not that dumb! The Beaver was made to gnaw, and gnaw he does"18; the giraffe is not tall in order to provide grotesque amusement for man but because he has adapted to a specific environment19; and tigers are not vicious, immoral killers of innocent life but merely unthinking survivors in a difficult world.20 In all cases, Cuppy draws humor from the fact that human or humanoid behavior is a tactic for survival rather than evidence of free choice and lofty ideals. Another incongruous aspect of humor exploited by Cuppy is what Herbert Spencer called "descending incongruity." This form of humor, which the naturalist may delight in exploiting, occurs when "the conscious is unawares transferred from great things to small."21 Cuppy continually compares animal or pre-Homo Sapien behavior or appearance to our own and thus deflates our pretensions to spiritual superiority. An additional bit of humor arises because the relatively unconscious performances of animals are frequently viewed as superior to our overly exquisite sensibilities. Thus, ironically, our chief claim to fame - our developed consciousness - is seen as one of our chief sources of discontent and fatuity. This incongruity between our self-proclaimed wisdom and the reality of our natural vulnerability is successfully employed in the sketches of early man and humanoid simians. Hence, Peking Man had a brain nearly as advanced as ours, yet he was happier because he left no culture. Indeed, "he knew nothing about the Ming Dynasty and he wrote no short poems. ... He had no imports and exports but he had fauna and flora."22 Ironically, like man, the Neanderthal Man had plenty of brains but somehow they did him no good. During the Great Ice Age the glaciers kept advancing and retreating much more than they do now. They kept 333</page><page sequence="5">the Neanderthals on the run. The glaciers were in a wild state and only the fleetest Neanderthals could escape from them. This was the survival of the fleetest. The Neanderthal Man had fires, caves, marrow bones, mosquitoes, love, and arthritis. What more can you ask?23 For Cuppy, both Neanderthal Man and Modern Man are part of nature and each has struggled to survive in its own way. Neither is totally safe from the earth's ravages. Finally, the Cro-Magnons were, like Modern Man, intelligent and respectable. Indeed, They invented Santa Claus, foreign missions, eggplant, punctuation, tattooing, and new methods of killing Neanderthals. They made rules preventing each other from doing what they did. We should love the Cro-Magnons because they were so smug. The Cro-Magnons were interested in art because of their unhappy home life which in turn was caused by their art. They would paint ... in a cave when there was no one to stop them. Warning against unwarranted feelings of derision, Cuppy advises us in a footnote to the above passage that Cro-Magnon personalities can be found in our family albums.24 Cuppy is also funny when he finds similarities between man and monkeys or apes. Written not too long after the Victorian debates over evolution and the Scopes Trial ("Monkey Trial") of 1925, How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes deals with a subject which had a particular poignancy at that time. Cuppy the naturalist finds dividing lines on the venerable Great Chain of Being less clear than William Jennings Bryant would have liked. For example, "in the Chimpanzee the hallux is opposable and the pollex is not. In man it is just the other way round so it all comes out even."25 Orangutans, like man, can brood and meditate upon their fate. But like us, "their prolonged spells of meditation appear to have no tangible results." But at least they have solved the problem of work: they don't.26 Even man cannot always tell the difference between his natural ancestors. We are told, for example, that "embalmed Gibbons are sometimes sold to country bumpkins as embalmed Pigmies. Why our rural population should prefer embalmed Pigmies to embalmed Gibbons offers an interesting problem in psychology."27 And the Organ Grinder Monkey or Capuchin is very intelligent: "He scrambles after pennies, scratches himself, and has morals." Standing on his hind legs, he is difficult to distinguish from man.28 Finally, the lemur is particularly distressing because of his human charac- teristics and because, In a way we came from Lemurs because they are also descended from an extinct Tree Shrew something like a large Rat. From the Tree Shrew to the Dogfish is but a step, which practically brings us to the Amoeba. So perhaps the Lemur is to blame for it all.29 334</page><page sequence="6">People in nature act like subhuman creatures and are determined by the same phenomena. Our willful denial of the fact makes us fatuous. A specific target of Cuppy's humor is the "expert" who refuses to recognize our participation in nature and who confuses his arbitrary categories with reality. These comic "experts" are perversely insen- sible to pain and affliction in nature while arrogantly assuming that man is in any case the zenith of creation. M. de Buffon, for instance, regarded the sloth as the most forlorn and wretched of brute creation, apparently believing that they were "the victims of perpetual pain, suffering perhaps under the special displeasure of Omnipotence." Will Cuppy denies this by noting that "Sloths seems quite cheerful at times."30 Clearly, one man's anthropomorphic projections are as good as another's. After all, animals can quote experts too: When faced with the self-evident truth that he is a Hyena, it is second nature to a Hyena to deny the whole thing, or rationalize it into a virtue, or quote Nietzsche, or tell you to mind your own business. An occasional Hyena thinks that other Hyenas are rather horrible.31 Furthermore, the Piltdown was stupider than us because anthro- pologists say so,32 the lemur is a primate because that is the name given by "professors,"33 and the wren is a kindly animal because a clergyman said so in June, 1835. 34 At various times Cuppy mocks the scientific pretensions of Pliny the Elder, Aristotle, Dr. Living- stone, and a host of self-important zoologists. In all cases it is implied that their perception reflected a pre-naturalist view of the world. In light of the shock to our self-esteem from fin de siecle Freudianism, historicism, Darwinism, Marxism, and irrationalism, such perceptions are no longer seriously tenable. Though Will Cuppy is a minor humorist at best, his awareness of the comedic use of naturalism gives his work a considerable interest for students of American humor. In detached, ironic fashion, he has described stereotyped, mechanical, unconscious behavior as more characteristic of man and animal than it is comfortable for man to believe. Lacking free will, rational control, and a particularly favored position in the universe, man (like the animals) can be discussed meaningfully "in the mass" as self-deceived. With his pretensions to ethereal greatness deflated, man must take his place in an opaque, often dysteleological natural order. As Cuppy finally notes, "I need hardly state that Man is the highest mammal, excepting possibly the Giraffe."35 NEW MEXICO MILITARY INSTITUTE 335</page><page sequence="7">NOTES 'Robert D.
