Erlandson ABSTRACT During reconnaissance of the outer coast of southeast Alaska, three unusual wooden artifacts were recovered from Wolf's Lair sea cave (49-CRG-381). Radiocarbon dates on a club and two decorat- ed planks indicate that these artifacts date to the Middle and Late Holocene, respectively. Herein, we describe the Wolf's Lair artifacts and their context. We have not found any specimens that match the forms and decorative style of the Wolf's Lair artifacts in regional literature or museum collec- tions. Analogous items suggest functional interpretations, but these remain hypothetical. Despite the richness of the ethnographic record of the Northwest Coast, archaeological research continues to yield unique and previously undocumented examples of material culture. RÉSUMÉ Trois artefacts inusités en bois ont été trouvés dans la grotte marine Wolfs Lair (49-CRG-381) lors d'une reconnaissance de la côte extérieure du sud-ouest de V Alaska. La datation au radiocarbone d'une massue remonte à l'Holocène moyen tandis que les deux planches décorées datent de l'Holocène récent. Dans cet article nous décrivons les objets de Wolfs Lair ainsi que leur contexte archéologique. Nous n'avons pas trouvé d'objets semblables, ni du point de vue formelle ou stylis- tique, dans la littérature ou dans les collections de musées. Des similitudes générales avec d'autres objets nous suggèrent des interprétations fonctionnelles, mais celles-ci demeurent hypothétiques. En dépit de la richesse du dossier ethnographique de la côte Nord-Ouest, la recherche archéologique continue d'être une source importante de données inédites sur la culture matérielle de la région. INTRODUCTION thousands of years, objects made of wood have played extremely important roles in the material and ceremonial cultures of Northwest Coast societies. The art and craft of woodwork- ing continues as a living tradition among many contemporary Northwest Coast artists. Today, masks, headdresses, boxes, totem poles, canoes, and even houses are displayed as fine art in museums and art galleries. These items are also constructed for use in contemporary cultural events and practices including ceremonies, memorials, canoe races, and most recently, in whale hunting. Artifacts of wood or other plant materials are thought to have comprised as much as 90% of the material culture of many First Nation societies in the past. While ethnographic collections dating from historic times provide a wealth of information about the nature of wooden constructions and artifacts made by Northwest Coast peoples, due to differential preservation, the archaeological record of these is often relatively impoverished. Exceptions to this are water-saturated sites such as Ozette (Samuels 1991), Hoko River (Croes 1995), Lachane (Inglis 1976; Croes 1989), Axeti (Hobler 1976), numerous wood stake weirs or traps (Moss et al. 1990; Eldridge and Acheson 1992; Moss and Erlandson 1998), and others (Bernick 1991, 1998, Fladmark et al. 1987), where anaerobic conditions have preserved nor- mally perishable wood and fiber artifacts. Studies of these sites have revolutionized Northwest Coast archaeology in the past 25 years. Aside from weirs and traps, however, the preservation of wooden artifacts in archaeologi- cal sites of appreciable antiquity has been rela- tively rare in southeast Alaska. In the vast reach- es of the Alexander Archipelago, the maritime Tlingit and Haida lived for centuries or even Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 24, 2000 -io?</page><page sequence="2">Moss/Erlandson Figure 1 : Prince of Wales Archipelago, Southeast Alaska 108 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="3">Wolfs Lair millennia (Moss et al. 1989). Recent archaeo- logical research in remote southeast Alaskan caves has shown that wooden artifacts of rela- tively great antiquity can be preserved in cave environments that are damp, but not wet. The preservation of these artifacts is due not to anaerobic conditions, but to the cool, dark, and relatively stable microenvironments that often characterize the interior of such caves. In this paper, we describe three wooden artifacts found in a large isolated sea cave on the west coast of Baker Island in the southern portion of southeast Alaska. We expect that cognate, homologous, or analogous forms will come from archaeolog- ical sites in British Columbia in the future. Southeast Alaska's Karst and Outer Coast Landscapes Much of the southern portion of southeast Alaska's topography is now recognized as lime- stone karst. Since 1990, the Tongass National Forest has supported a program of interdiscipli- nary research involving archaeologists, geolo- gists, paleontologists, spelunkers, and others to document caves and rockshelters on the Prince of Wales Archipelago (Erlandson and Moss 1994; Dixon et al. 1997). The effort to identify these landforms was prompted by passage in 1988 of the Cave Resource Protection Act. This U.S. federal law represents an effort to curtail the inadvertent damage many of these unique places have suffered as a consequence of resource extraction industries, recreational use, and looting. Located west of Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island covers more than 6700 square kilometers (Figure 1), making it the third largest island in the United States after Kodiak Island in Alaska and the island of Hawaii. It is comparable in size to Graham Island in the Queen Charlotte Islands, and approximately one-fifth the area of Vancouver Island. Prince of Wales Island is sur- rounded by hundreds of smaller islands making up the archipelago, underlain by an estimated 2400 square kilometers of carbonate rock (Baichtal 1992:2). The area is dominated by large, northwest-southeast trending high-angle faults that break the region into blocks of car- bonate and non-carbonate bedrock. Karst topography has developed on roughly 75% of the area with carbonate bedrock (Baichtal 1992:3). As of July, 2000, more than 600 caves and rockshelters have been identified in the region (Terence Fifield, 2000, pers. comm.). Many of these are solution caves, formed by water seeping through limestone bedrock. Others are sea caves, carved by the Pacific Ocean along both modern and older shorelines. Still others are rockshelters formed along the sides of bedrock outcrops and headlands or sea stacks associated with old shorelines. These caves and rockshelters often contain rare and well-preserved records of glacial and climatic history, vertebrate paleontology, sea- level history, and human history. For example, Heaton (1995, Heaton et al. 1996; see also Sattler and Dixon 1997) has dated animal bones from various caves on Prince of Wales Island, demonstrating that the island functioned as a glacial refugium during the late Pleistocene. Different species of bears appear to have inhab- ited Prince of Wales Island for much of the last 40,000 years. The remains of animals that no longer live in this portion of Alaska - including brown bear, red fox, caribou, Saiga antelope, marmot, lemming, heather vole, and ringed seal - illustrate dramatic environmental change over the millennia (Baichtal 1998). These findings indicate that the Prince of Wales Archipelago was available for human occupation before the end of the Pleistocene as well. Heusser (1960), Fladmark (1979), Erlandson (1994, 2001), and Dixon (1999), among others, have proposed that some of the first people to enter the Americas may have trav- eled along a coastal migration route from their homelands in northeast Asia. In 1996, human remains were found in the 49-PET-408 cave, dated to about 9200 years ago (Dixon et al. 1997). Excavation of deposits underlying the 9000 year-old levels in this site is underway. Sites of comparable age have been found else- where in southeast Alaska and Haida Gwaii (see Fedje and Christensen 1999; Moss 1998). Because its shorelines are very rugged, storm-battered, and remote, relatively little is known about the archaeology of the outer coast of the Prince of Wales Archipelago. Survey in outer coast locales suggests, however, that dur- ing the distant past, settlement was much less intensive than the more protected coastlines of Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 24, 2000 -|09</page><page sequence="4">Moss/Erlandson Figure 2: Wolfs Lair Sea Cave (49-CRG-381), Baker Island, Alaska 110 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="5">Wolfs Lair the interior portions of the archipelago. Wolf's Lair: Location, Setting and Site Configuration Wolf's Lair is a spectacular littoral sea cave that has been uplifted above modern sea level. The cave is located on the outer coast of Baker Island, at the head of a small isolated cove on the north shore of Vita Bay. The site name derives from the story that one of the first inves- tigators to visit the site observed wolf tracks inside. The shoreline in this area consists of extremely rugged limestone bedrock cliffs and talus boulder beaches. In front of Wolf's Lair, the shoreline is comprised of very large angular boulders fallen from the high cliffs that tower above the site. Except on the calmest of days, the cave can be reached only on foot and then only with difficulty during low tides. From nearshore waters, the cave mouth is largely obscured from view by the accumulation of a large talus cone of boulder debris and by trees which grow upon it. Its inconspicuous entrance, remoteness, and difficult access help explain why the site appears to have been visited only rarely both prehistorically and historically. The mouth of Wolf's Lair cave (9m asl) is marked by a high arch- shaped opening into which the visitor descends as one climbs down the talus ridge just outside the mouth. The inte- rior of the cave is more than 100 meters deep and more than 40 meters wide (Fig. 2). A sec- ond rockfall ridge is present just inside the mouth of the cave, caused by a massive collapse of the ceiling. In places, this rock fall consists of very large boulders, some of which are inter- spersed with open cavities and drift logs. Behind the second rockfall ridge, the vast interi- or of the cave is quite dark. Extending for 40 meters along the west wall of the cave, is a IO- meter wide raft of drift logs deposited by storm surf prior to the formation of the second rockfall ridge. Radiocarbon dates on the outer rings of seven of these logs span almost a millennium, ranging from 3430 to 4360 B.P. (Table 1). Among the dated logs, the oldest are generally found near the back of the cave, while logs located closer to the mouth of the cave are younger, suggesting that they may have accu- mulated gradually. Sometime after about 3400 years ago, the interior of the cave seems to have been sealed off from storm surf, probably by a combination of tectonic or isostatic uplift and formation of the large rockfall ridges just out- side and inside the cave mouth. Evidence for human occupation is relatively sparse in Wolf's Lair. Risa Carlson (1993) noted the presence of four hearth-like features along the east wall of the cave's main chamber. Analysis of two charcoal samples from a small campsite along the east wall of the cave (indi- cated as "living area" on Figure 2), just behind the second rock fall ridge, produced uncorrected radiocarbon dates of 1720 ± 60 B.P. (Beta- 5571 1) and 1530 ± 50 B.P. (Beta-75468). Several darkly stained or discolored areas around the edge of the drift log deposit along the west wall of the cave were noted in the vicinity of an extensive accumulation of small fish bones. A test pit excavated in this area in 1994 produced no clear evidence of human occupa- tion in very shallow sediments overlying a grav- el beach deposit. It seems likely that these stained areas and fish bone accumulations are natural in origin, the latter the result of land otter (Lontra canadensis) activity (see Erlandson and Moss 2001). Near the south end of the drift logs, among a tangle of logs along the west cave wall, a cluster of bark and wood shavings that were much bet- ter preserved than the surrounding logs was found. Since few of the drift logs retain any bark, and the preservation of the logs is much poorer in comparison, people almost certainly deposited the bark and wood shavings long after the drift logs were washed into the cave. The wood shavings may have been intended as kin- dling, since most wood inside the cave is quite moist, or they could be debris from making wood artifacts. A few of these bark strips or wood shavings were collected, but none have been radiocarbon dated. A 5,000 Year Old Wooden Implement An L-shaped wooden implement was found on the surface in the deep interior of the cave, at the north end of the drift logs. The implement is made from a single piece of Alaska yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), with the right- angled "elbow" constructed around the intersec- tion of a branch or knot in the wood (Figure 3). Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 24, 2000 m</page><page sequence="6">Moss/Erlandson Like the drift logs nearby, the wood of the implement is poorly preserved, slightly spongy, and disintegrating. This is likely due to the implement's great age; analysis of a splinter from the elbow area produced an AMS date of 4440 ± 60 B.P. (Beta-74861) and a calibrated age of 5010 ± 60 cal B.P. This is roughly simi- lar to the age of the oldest of the dated drift logs nearby and represents a maximum age for the artifact, since the date reflects the growth of the wood, not its manufacture or use by people. The implement is 23.5 cm long, with a head about 12 cm long. The head is sub-rectangular in cross-section and ranges from 20 to 22 cm in diameter. Most of the handle is sub-trapezoidal in cross-section, with the side of the handle fac- ing the viewer of Figure 3 being one of two non- parallel sides that flares upward. The parallel sides of the trapezoid, the top and bottom of the cross section, are actually a bit curved, hence our use of the term "sub-trapezoidal." The diameter of the handle ranges from 19 cm at the base of the head to 6.5 cm at a position 1 cm in from the end of the handle. The proximal end of the handle approaches a circular shape in cross- section. As mentioned above, the head of the imple- ment incorporates knotwood, which may have been selected for its strength. The handle is made of straighter grained wood. Weathering and drying-out have caused the growth rings around the knot to stand out in relief, showing the twisted grain, and surface evidence of mod- ification has been obscured by this process. While the implement may have been fashioned from driftwood, it seems more likely that it was split from a drift log or cut from a tree. The implement is clearly shaped, and the side of the knot appears to have been ground smooth. Although no chopping, adzing, or sawing marks are evident, the proximal end of the handle has been whittled, and the nonparallel sides of the bulk of the handle are flat and smooth, presum- ably from grinding, perhaps on the surface of a granular rock. The working end of the implement is stud- ded with 25 broken fish spines, although one of these was found well down the side of the head. Scattered among the fish spines are 14 addition- al holes that appear to have held fish spines at some time in the past. One of the spines was identified as rockfish by Nora Foster (1994, pers. comm.). The spines are not arranged in a detectable pattern. Most enter the wood perpen- dicular to the working surface, but a few enter at angles. Five spines temporarily removed were an average of 5.6 mm long and the pointed ends all projected into the wood. While some spines Figure 3: 5,000 Year Old Wooden Implement from Wolf's Lair 112 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="7">Wolfs Lair are flush with the surface of the head, others protrude as much as 2 mm. The spines are brit- tle now, but they may have been more flexible in the past. We cannot be certain whether the spines were impaled on the implement inciden- tally or intentionally, but they do not appear to have been placed in prepared holes. Whether the spines served utilitarian, decorative, or other purposes is unclear. The implement can be held comfortably in one's hand, and based on its general form, the following uses seem possible: • It may have been used as a club to kill fish. When fish are caught via hook and line or when netted or trapped, they are frequently stunned or dispatched with a club. • It may have been used as a mallet to ten- derize tough shellfish meats the way abalone mallets are used today. • It may have served as a weapon used in hand-to-hand combat. • It may have been used as a comb for prepar- ing plant fibers, such as cedar bark or net- tles, subsequently used to manufacture cordage, netting, or clothing. • It may have been used like a wool carder to prepare animal fibers, like mountain goat or dog wool, subsequently used in spinning or weaving. • It may have been used as a comb or brush in grooming. • It may have been used in ceremonies as a symbol of corporate or personal power. One way to evaluate these possible functions is to search for ethnographic analogs, since the record of First Nations' material culture dating from the last 300 years is remarkably rich. We have also searched the record for archaeological analogs. With the help of generous colleagues, we have been able to locate a few objects allow- ing us to evaluate some of the possible functions listed above. In 1994, we visited the American Museum of Natural History which holds 59 wood clubs in their Northwest Coast collection. Photographs of these and other objects held in the Museum are now accessible via the internet &lt;http://anthro.amnh.org&gt;. In this collection, seven clubs are explicitly identified as 'fish' or 'fishing' clubs, 14 as 'halibut clubs', and three as 'salmon' clubs. Among these, nine had bail- or cylinder- shaped heads grossly similar to the Wolf's Lair implement. The club that most strongly resembled the Wolf's Lair implement is an L-shaped Clayoquot wood fishing club, 29.5 cm long, with a 12 cm long head, angled greater than 90°. One other one-piece L-shaped club was found in the collection, this one made of stone and identified as a "war" club collected from the Sitka vicinity in Tlingit territory. It measured 23 cm long in length, with a 7-cm long head. Overall the average size of the wood clubs is significantly larger than these two clubs and the Wolf's Lair implement. Fishing clubs average 42.6 cm long and 8.5 cm wide, the halibut clubs average 45.5 cm long and 8.1 cm wide and the salmon clubs average 52.5 cm long and 8.4 cm wide. In a permanent display at the Field Museum of Natural History is a Haida fish-killing club (Accession No. 53003) that also resembles the Wolf's Lair club in general outline, although the head of the Field Museum specimen is ball- shaped. The examples of fish-killing clubs with bulbous heads illustrated in Goddard (1934:69) are specifically identified as halibut-killing clubs. A search of the Canadian Museum of Civilization's on-line digitized collection turned up 72 clubs from the Northwest Coast &lt;http://www.civilization.ca: 8082/cgi- bin/emupublic?form=emu_public.english&gt;. Images of 62 of these were available, and the range of variability is much like that exhibited in the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum collections. One other small club, known as the Fraser River Club, was found during river dredging (Fladmark et al. 1987). It measures 31 cm long by 8.8 cm wide, and has a zoomorphic head pro- truding beyond a ball-shaped working surface. Its handle is also decorated with a zoomorphic form. This artifact is directly dated to 1000 ± Journal Canadien d'Archeologie 24, 2000 113</page><page sequence="8">Moss/Erlandson 130 B.P. (Fladmark et al. 1987:9). A variety of types of wooden and bone clubs differ significantly from these relatively small clubs. These include the widely illustrated high- ly decorated clubs of whalebone and wood from Ozette (Daugherty and Friedman 1983:193) and wood clubs for killing sea otter, seals, and as weapons of war collected from the Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and Wakashans (e.g., Niblack 1888:Plate XXVIII; Stewart 1977:62; Drucker 1963:78). Both decorated and undecorated bone clubs have been found archaeologically in the Prince Rupert Harbor vicinity (MacDonald 1983: 1 10). These have been considered warrior weapons; some have handles decorated with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic designs, their straight shafts are sometimes decorated, and they do not have prominent bulbs or balls at their ends. Duff (1963) identified four types of stone clubs represented in a sample of nearly 50 clubs from the Skeena River vicinity. Most of these were thought to date to the late prehistoric peri- od. Duff's stone club types included: 1) clubs with paddle-like blades, similar to the whale- bone clubs mentioned above, 2) pestle-shaped clubs, 3) clubs with projecting points or blades, sometimes called 'slave-killers', and 4) zoomor- phic clubs. Across these types, several examples are phallic in form and decoration (see also Duff 1983:54-55; MacDonald 1983:115; Stryd 1983:169). The 'slave-killer' type was also illus- trated by Niblack (1888:XLVI), Drucker (1963:78), and Stewart (1996:72). Such weapons could have been used in combat, but also could have been used to ritually break cop- pers. The Wolf's Lair implement resembles the small fish killing clubs described above more than it does any of the stone club types. None of the archaeological specimens described above are as old as the Wolf's Lair implement. None of the ethnographic or archae- ological clubs described above held any spines or spikes either. In response to our queries, Steve Henrikson (pers. comm. 1996), Alaska State Museum, con- tacted Peter Corey, Sheldon Jackson Museum, who knew of a spiked club from the Northwest Coast. The latter is a spiked and decorated staff worn along with a bear costume used in a Kwakwaka'wakw winter ceremonial (Boas 1897:511-512). Boas's illustration derives from a sketch made at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and the staff now resides in the Field Museum of Natural History. The Field Museum's catalog card indicates that the club or staff was a weapon of the A'mlala Society and was collected by George Hunt. Although it is spiked, the A'mlala staff is sub- stantially different in form and decoration than the Wolf's Lair implement: 1) the shaft of the staff is painted with a bold geometric design, 2) the shaft is straight and terminates with a round- ed head whose diameter is not much larger than that of the shaft, and 3) the spikes are substan- tially larger in size and protrude a significant length beyond the head of the club. The length of the staff and the material with which the spines are made are unknown at this time. One other A'mlala staff is known from the American Museum of Natural History collec- tion. Like the Field Museum specimen, its head is spiked, in this case with 15 wood spines that might approach 10cm in length. The total length of the club is 84.5cm, making it substantially larger than the Wolf's Lair implement. A red cedar bark cordage collar decorates the AMNH staff. In contrast to both A'mlala staffs, the Wolf's Lair implement is undecorated, L- shaped, and holds much smaller, shorter, and more delicate spines. While the A'mlala staffs visually convey power and authority, and their long and robust spines appear to pose a substan- tial threat to fellow humans, the Wolf's Lair implement appears quite modest and utilitarian in comparison. Other possibilities mentioned above include processing plant or animal products. We have not located any ethnographic references to First Nations people using mallets to tenderize meat, although the abalone mallet does seem like a viable contemporary analog used today on the California coast. Two main classes of implements are known to have been used to process cedar bark fibers on the Northwest Coast, however. These include bark beaters and bark shredders. Bark beaters are bone or wood objects with short han- dles, approximately one-half the length of their working head. The rectangular head of the mal- 114 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="9">Wolfs Lair let often has long parallel grooves for processing the cedar bark (Niblack 1888:312; Carlson 1983:13; Stewart 1996:93). Bark shredders are ulu-shaped stone, bone or wood objects (MacDonald 1983:115; Stewart 1996:62-63) used to pound cedar bark. Mat creasers were probably used in making tule mats; the oldest is a decorated cedar example from Hoko (Croes 1995:175) dated to 2750 B.P. None of these closely resembles the Wolf's Lair implement in form. However, it seems pos- sible that the Wolf's Lair tool could have func- tioned as a combination bark shredder/bark beater; its mallet shape is analogous to that of the beater and the spines projecting from the head might have been useful in shredding bark. Whether the spines were strong enough for these tasks is unknown, however. The Wolf's Lair implement is significantly different in form from the wood and bone combs of the Northwest Coast (Holm 1983:37; MacDonald 1983:107-108; Borden 1983:162; Styrd 1983:173; Daugherty and Friedman 1983:186, 193; Stewart 1996:118). These are small, flat, rectangular objects with solid, deco- rated and undecorated handles, sometimes with one toothed end, sometimes with a bridge sepa- rating two ends with teeth. The teeth are large and widely spaced, compared to the spines of the Wolf's Lair implement. Combs are generally thought to have been used or worn by individuals, but they also may have been used in loom weaving, or to process sinew or nettles fiber (Stewart 1996:118). Nevertheless, their form differs so substantially from that of the Wolf's Lair implement that it is hard to support an argument for a similar func- tion. Finally, we were unable to locate any ethno- graphic information relating to the possible function of carding animal fibers. Samuel (1982:54) suggested that mountain goat wool does not require combing or carding prior to spinning. No items matching the exact form of the Wolf's Lair implement have been found in the ethnographic literature or collections. The most likely function appears to be use as a fish- killing club. However, the great antiquity of the implement raises the possibility that there may not be an ethnographic analog of this object. Two 1,200 Year Old Decorated Wooden Planks Along the east wall of Wolf's Lair and just north of the second rockfall ridge is a cleared area about 15m by 8m wide associated with what appear to be several hearths, charcoal from which was 14C dated to 1720 ± 60 and 1530 ± 50 B.P. (Carlson 1993). Just south of this appar- ent living area, among the mass of rock debris collapsed from the cave ceiling, are a series of large boulders interspersed with voids, fissures, and occasional drift logs. Some of these fissures have been used in recent times by land otters, including a 'crawl space' 1.5m wide, 3.0m long, and less than a meter high. A land otter skull, other bones, and an otter "midden" offish bones were observed on the ground in this crawl space. In this crawl space - essentially a cave with- in a cave - a wooden plank (#1) was found lying flat on the silt-covered floor, completely coated in silty rock flour. When portions of the plank were washed, a series of carved designs and other technological features emerged from beneath the silt. Plank #1 is 97.5cm long, 12cm wide, and about 2.5cm thick (the lower plank in Figure 4). One edge of the plank has four small rectangular holes cut or chiseled into it, three of which contain remnants of withes used to fasten the plank to another object. Although broken in places, the preservation of this wood plank is excellent with clearly engraved and painted designs, cut marks, and intact bindings surviv- ing on one face of the plank. Some of the engravings contain traces of red ochre and pos- sibly a white pigment, as well. Just outside the mouth of the crawl space, about 3m from Plank #1, a second plank (#2) was found wedged among boulders and a drift log (the upper plank in Figure 4). Apparently exposed to greater fluctuations in temperature and humidity, Plank #2 was neither as damp or nearly as well-preserved as Plank #1, which was coated in a veneer of damp silt. Plank #2 is much more heavily weathered, with the wood grain deeply exposed and almost all traces of decoration obscured. Plank #2 is 73cm long, 9cm wide, and 2.25cm thick. Faint remnants of a concentric ovals-and-dot design are present on one face of the plank, but no other decoration or red ochre is evident. Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 24, 2000 115</page><page sequence="10">Moss/Erlandson Both planks were made by splitting wood across the grain, and each contains about 40 to 50 annual growth rings. Plank #2 has been iden- tified as western hemlock (Tsuga hete rophy ila), and it is likely that Plank #1 is hemlock also. The ends of the planks may have been cut or sawn and snapped. Clearly, the planks were attached to one another at one time, since the cut holes and irregular edges on both planks articu- late perfectly with one another (Figure 5). To the right of the articulating notch, the top edge of Plank #1 is smooth and flat and appears to have been shaped by planing or sanding. The bottom edge of Plank #1 does not appear to have been finished, but weathering has taken its toll. Evidently, the withes were used to fasten the two planks together. The planks are not dressed with adze marks in a regular pattern, but stray chopping and chis- eling marks are evident. The engraved designs appear to have been executed by first making fine cuts, perhaps with a shell or stone knife, and then gouging out the wood fabric with another tool, perhaps a stone burin or beaver-toothed chisel. On Plank #1, the amount of wood gouged out in making the designs varies considerably; the line width of curvilinear designs generally ranges from 0.1cm to 1.5cm. Engraved in the center of the plank are three lines oriented roughly perpendicular to the main axis of the plank and crossing nearly its entire width. The central line is broad and filled with red ochre, while the lines on either side are narrower and slightly curved. On both sides of this central figure are ochre-stained asymmetrical V-shaped figures, with the inner side of each V running roughly parallel to the three central lines. These two V shapes are not exact mirror images of each other; the right V is noticeably larger and the outer portion of the V veers off at a 70° angle, while the outer portion of the left V veers off at a 60° angle. A considerable amount of wood mass has been removed from the vertical element of the right V. Beneath the right V may be an elongated wedge design with two crescent shapes oriented diagonally across the plank. Further to the right, is a dot encompassed by two concentric ovals, and near the right end of the Figure 4: Pair of 1200 Year Old Wooden Planks from Wolf's Lair. of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="11">Wolfs Lair Figure 5: Close-up of wooden planks from Wolf's Lair showing notch on Plank #1, withe filled hole on Plank #2, and portions of ovals-and-dot motif.

On the left side of the plank is what appears to be another dot encompassed by two concen- tric ovals, but the bottom halves of these ovals have been lost to attrition. This ovals-and-dot figure is positioned a bit lower on the plank than the ovals-and-dot figure on the right side. Further to the left, is what may be another V- shaped figure, but this one is smaller than the others and is not fully executed. The bottom portion of the right stem of the V-shape is marked by a fine cut mark, but one that has not been gouged out or filled with red ochre. Near the left end of the plank is a cres- cent shape, what may be the remnant of another spiral, but because the plank has suffered con- siderable damage, the original design is unclear. We submitted samples of the withes to Nancy Stenholm of Botana Labs for identifica- tion. Stenholm identified these as cedar branch wood, either from red cedar (Thuja plicata) or Alaska yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis). Stenholm explained that the twisting process used to manufacture the withes had deformed the diagnostic features that would allow firm species identification. (The northern limit of red cedar is Frederick Sound, located about 160km north of the project area). Stenholm (1994) suggested that the twisted cedar withe may be a rare archaeological exam- ple of a rope-making technique Turner et al. (1983:38) described for the Nitinaht of Vancouver Island: Ropes . . . were made from the split young branches, or withes, of western red cedar. The withes were twisted while still attached to the tree, until they had broken into many longitudinal strands. The bark was then removed, the strands untwisted, and the withe cut off the tree. These were twisted into rope by rolling on the bare thigh.... Stenholm also found powdered marine shell on the surface and the inside of the twist of both samples, and found long mammal hairs sticking to one specimen. Referring to the Nitinaht, again, for an ethnographic analog: This spinning process was done on the bare thigh and the skin on one's leg required constant lubrication to keep it from chafing. The original lubricant used was mussel-shell "filing" dust (a by-product from the manufacture of chisels and harpoon heads of mussel shell). When flour was first introduced by European traders, it was also used as a lubricant, as well as talcum powder (Turner et al. 1983:69). Cedar withe-making has also been described and illustrated by Stewart (1984:161-165). Slivers from the outermost growth rings of Planks #1 and #2 provided AMS 14C dates of 1 170 ± 60 B.P. (Beta-74862) and 1260 ± 70 B.P. (Beta-74863), respectively. Since these dates measure the growth of the wood, the planks appear to have been cut and decorated sometime after 1140 cal B.P. We do not know the exact origin or function of the planks. The presence of red ochre and fragile withe fragments suggests that the planks were intentionally brought to the cave, not washed in with nearby drift logs. Despite their location within a sea cave, the planks do not appear to be part of a burial box. No human bones or associated funerary objects were found with the planks or anywhere within the cave. As described below, several features of the planks are also markedly different than the many bent- wood boxes we have examined in museum col- lections. Like the Wolf's Lair implement, we have not been able to locate near-matches in ethnograph- ic or archaeological collections. The general form of the articulated planks is not functional- ly specific, although in this case we can evaluate a range of works to compare the carved designs and means of decoration. During our analyses we have considered the following uses of the planks, based on possible ethnographic analogs as well as the suggestions of colleagues: • They may have been part of a box that has undergone repair. • They may have been part of a wooden shield. • They originally may have been part of a canoe, subsequently recycled for other pur- 118 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="13">Wolfs Lair poses. • They may be the fragmentary remains of architectural features or furnishings (e.g., a house screen, bench, or settee). Ethnographically, most bentwood boxes are made of red cedar and have two or three separate elements - a long board that is kerfed and bent to form the four sides of a box, a board that forms the base, and in some cases a top or lid (Mauger 1982:74-76). The sides and base of boxes are typically made from one piece of wood. Neither of the Wolf's Lair planks shows clear signs of kerfing, but one end of Plank #1 appears as if it has been sawn or cut and then beveled. In some respects, it resembles ethno- graphic specimens in which the outer surfaces of box corners are splitting or where the box maker has intentionally reduced the thickness of a cor- ner by cutting a channel to facilitate bending. While this modification could be related to kerf- ing, it more closely resembles a shiplap joint. Box planks sometimes crack and are repaired with lashing, and we considered the possibility that the cedar bindings might repre- sent repair work. However, the finished edges of these planks and the formal spacing of the notches suggest that this is not the case for these specimens. The carefully prepared offset edges that join the two planks are unlike any examples of ethnographic boxes we have observed. Further, the dimensions of the planks are not consistent with the typical form of ethnographi- cally documented boxes. The American Museum of Natural History holds a large sample of rectangular wooden boxes; best represented are those of Tlingit (n = 75) and Haida (n = 6) origin. By comparison, the Wolf's Lair planks' lengths are proportion- ately too long relative to their width and thick- ness, at least compared to most ethnographic boxes. Tool boxes (n = 4) are proportionately longer than wide or deep, but these boxes are substantially smaller (41.7 cm x 12 cm x 10.6 cm) than the Wolf's Lair plank dimensions imply. Archaeological box fragments from Lachane (n = 11) were apparently from small containers, possibly water buckets (Inglis 1976: 172). More than 1200 box fragments were found at Ozette (Mauger 1982:73), but box part dimensions have not been reported. The closest analog we could find in terms of size was a Haida arrow box collected by John Swanton. It measured 97.5cm by 11.2cm by 8.5cm, and was collected along with 12 arrows, the longest of which was 89cm long. The box itself is undecorated and the metal and string used in the arrows indicate a post-contact age for these artifacts. Steve Henrikson suggested to us that the planks might be fragments of a wooden shield. He referred us to two flat Aleut shields illustrat- ed in Collins et al. (1977:52-53), one of which was collected from Kagamil Island by Ales Hrdlicka. Both of these shields are made of two wood boards lashed together, with leather bind- ings in a zigzag fashion. One shield has mini- mal decoration, whereas the other is painted with a pair of elaborate spirals comprised of at least six rings, set within an encompassing eye- shaped design, further elaborated with a series of dots. This shield is 70cm tall, and an estimat- ed 52-53cm wide, with each of the two boards approximating 26-27cm wide. In comparison, Wolf's Lair Plank #1 is more than 27cm longer, and both Wolf's Lair's planks are half as wide as the Kagamil shield boards. The Wolf's Lair planks appear to be quite heavy and are proba- bly too long to be practical as parts of a shield covering the human torso. In his analysis of the shed-roof house remains from Ozette, Mauger (1991) identified both morphological and functional classes of wood planks. The basic functional categories were wall planks, roof planks, and benches. Measurements are presented for four of five morphological types: split planks, dressed planks, bilaterally lipped planks, and unilateral- ly lipped planks (Mauger 1991:64-70). All of these four morphological types were made by splitting with the grain of the wood, and all are substantially longer, wider, (and from examina- tion, considerably heavier) than the Wolf's Lair planks. The Wolf's Lair planks fall considerably outside the range of variation represented in these groups, and for this reason would seem unsuited to serving as part of a wall plank, roof plank, or bench in a house as large as those rep- resented at Ozette. Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 24, 2000 119</page><page sequence="14">Moss/Erlandson Split cedar boards were also found at the Hoko River wet site, but these are substantially smaller than the Wolf's Lair planks. Croes (1995:165) reported the mean values for the Hoko boards as 36cm long, 5.23cm wide, and 1.67cm thick. He suggested these were 'cores' or split-stick debitage used to or resulting from the manufacture of the handles for the side-haft- ed microlith knives found at the site. An additional morphological type from Ozette is the cross-grain plank. As described by Mauger (1991:65), "the sides of the planks show the grain curving back on itself while in edge view the grain is diagonal from one side to the other." The Ozette cross-grain planks were made from the sides of canoes and exhibit some degree of lateral and longitudinal curvature. Such canoe parts were recycled and used as wall planks in the Ozette houses. Some of these are reminiscent of the Wolf's Lair planks specifical- ly with regard to the presence of bindings: The grain exhibited on cross-grain planks indicates that they were fash- ioned by carving at an angle to the nat- ural grain of the log rather than by split- ting with the grain.... On a few pieces, strips are sewn onto one edge of the larg- er fragments. These strips originally were gunwale strips and the larger sec- tions of plank are hull fragments.... Pairs of drilled holes, often plugged with the remains of withes, are found on a few of the specimens. These holes are the perforations in the hulls of canoes through which passed the withes that bound the thwarts in place. In 2000, we visited the Makah Cultural and Research Center in Neah Bay, Washington, to examine wood planks in the museum's remark- able archaeological collection. Among the cross-grain planks, two shared some similarities with the Wolf's Lair planks. Specimen 60-IV- 33, identified as a canoe gunwale, was 240cm long, 9cm at its widest point, and 3cm thick. Specimen 78-IV-5 was not labeled a gunwale, but was similar in form and approximately the same size. Both Ozette specimens had cut or drilled holes along one edge, similar to those of the Wolf's Lair planks. Specimen 60-IV-33 had 12 lashing holes that were unevenly spaced at an average of 17.5cm apart. Specimen 78-IV-5 also had 12 unevenly spaced lashing holes, aver- aging about 18cm apart. By comparison, Wolf's Lair Plank #1 is less than half the length of the Ozette planks, but comparable in width and thickness. The four lashing holes on Plank #1 are spaced 26cm apart, somewhat more widely spaced than those of the Ozette planks. A sig- nificant number of the Ozette planks' lashing holes are filled with withes or cordage, similar to those of the Wolf's Lair planks. One striking similarity is that one edge of each of the Wolf's Lair planks and one edge of specimen 78-IV-5 are not straight, but possess what appears to be a purposeful jag or notch. The Wolf's Lair planks have complementary jags that assist in their articulation with each other and structurally appear to prevent the planks from sliding against one another. The placement of the lashing holes on the Ozette planks also suggests these planks were meant to articulate with other pieces of wood. Whether or not these were canoe thwarts as suggested by Mauger for the Ozette specimens is not clear. However, the general morphological similarity between the Ozette and Wolf's Lair planks suggests that the latter may be recycled canoe parts. The significant difference in overall length and the spacing between lashing holes may relate to both canoe dimensions and con- straints imposed by raw material: red cedar in the case of Ozette versus western hemlock at Wolf's Lair. Western hemlock does seem to be an unlikely material with which to carve a canoe, however. Another possibility is that the planks might be part of a much larger, composite object. We can imagine them as fragments of a house screen (e.g., de Laguna 1972:1008), settee (e.g., Holm 1983:42), grave monument (e.g., Suttles 1983:83), mask or headdress with articulating parts, a canoe ornament, or dance staff or paddle (de Laguna 1972:930, 1060). In some respects, they are reminiscent of Coast Salish spirit boards (Suttles 1983:71; Jonaitis 1988:88), although the design of the Wolf's Lair planks is oriented horizontally, while the spirit board designs are oriented vertically. The scale of the Wolf's Lair planks seems appropriate for a 120 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="15">Wolfs Lair bench in a canoe or perhaps as a backrest, although their ornamentation would seem unnecessary for such a function. Stylistic Analysis For stylistic comparisons, we can consider design elements, motifs, and design principles or composition (sensu M. Holm 1990). The design elements on the Wolf's Lair planks include the V-shape, ovals-and-dot, spiral-and- dot, crescent, and possibly, elongated wedge. M. Holm (1990:52) has defined a motif as "a representational subject or theme found in many decorated objects." Are the Wolf's Lair design elements better thought of as 'motifs'? In other words, are they representational? Obviously, this is a matter of interpretation. The Wolf's Lair designs could be viewed as non-representational, geometric, or abstract. Viewed another way, the V-shaped designs might represent a central nose, beak, or mouth, with the two ovals-and-dot designs on either side representing eyes of an abstract zoomorph. Another possibility is that the ovals-and-dot figure on the right side of the plank represents the head of a bird, with the two crescents and elongated wedge to its lower left being part of its long beak. On the left side of the plank, cut marks positioned to the lower right of the ovals- and-dot may have comprised a similar form, but this part of the plank has not been preserved. Meredith Heilman (2000, pers. comm.), Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Makah Cultural and Research Center, viewed the design yet another way. She suggested that the right- hand half of Plank 1 depicted a wolf in profile, facing the right, with the low spiral as its flared nostrils, the ovals-and-dot design as its eye, and its ears flattened back as depicted in the V- shaped design. As mentioned above, the design on the left side of the plank is too incomplete to hazard an interpretation. Obviously, we cannot "prove" any of these interpretations. The most conspicuous designs on the Wolf's Lair planks are the ovals-and-dot and spiral-and- dot. These are not design elements discussed explicitly by M. Holm in her study of 243 archaeological objects from British Columbia. She lists "joint ovals/circles" under design ele- ments, although if anatomical joints are being represented, one would classify these as motifs, following her own terminology. Nevertheless, the joint ovals/circles are not widespread as indicated in her tabulations, present on only four artifacts in her sample. The under-representation of these design elements may reflect two characteristics of M. Holm's study sample: 1) she excluded non-rep- resentational imagery (M. Holm 1990:2), and 2) she did not assess petroglyphs (or pictographs), where these designs have been noted. The absence of petroglyphs from M. Holm's sample seems unfortunate, because some of the same carving techniques used to make petroglyphs were also used to make a large portion of her sample: the stone bowls. Perhaps the Wolf's Lair planks' ovals-and- dot designs resemble eye forms depicted on pet- roglyphs and may be a precursor to the classic eye form within an ovoid of Northwest Coast ethnographic art. Yet ovals-and-dot designs do exist in ethnographic and late prehistoric art. Bill McLennan (1995, pers. comm.), University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology, pointed out that the Wolf's Lair ovals-and-dot resemble the eye forms of several face masks depicted on a skin robe collected by Emmons and held in the Field Museum (Catalog No. 1 8 1 66). Mauger ( 1 99 1 : 1 63) illustrated a carved knot on an Ozette plank that is roughly similar. The spiral design is not typical of ethno- graphic art, but resembles the style of some pet- roglyph motifs. Lundy (1983) grouped circular, spiral, and rayed forms of this sort into what she has termed the "abstract curvilinear" rock art style. The simplicity of the Wolf's Lair designs is comparable to a carving on a Lummi house- post (Suttles 1983:79), although the Lummi example is executed with precision; the circles are perfectly round and the lines are straight. Interpretation of the designs as motifs and recognition of the overall composition is com- plicated by the poor preservation of Plank #2. The decoration appears to have been roughly (but not perfectly) bilaterally symmetrical, but we cannot know for certain. Mirror imaging suggests that six and possibly eight ovals-and- dot or spiral motifs once decorated the two boards. The designs are informally executed and lack precision in the shape and placement of elements. Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 24, 2000 12I</page><page sequence="16">Moss/Erlandson Table 1.

All dates measure the growth of the wood/charcoal samples, not their cultural use. The designs carved on the Wolf's Lair planks differ markedly from classic Northwest Coast formline design, epitomized in the ethno- graphic styles of the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian (B. Holm 1990). The formline sys- tem dictates that: ...creatures be portrayed by repre- senting their body parts and details with varyingly broad "formlines" which always joined to present an uninterrupt- ed grid over the designed area. The body parts were stylized in forms consistent with the semi-angular, symmetrical, nonconcentric qualities of formlines. Certain uniform shapes resulted, the most obvious and recognizable being ovoids and U forms of different sizes and proportions. Formlines joined one another in a limited number of juncture types, which were designed to permit smooth transitions from one formline to another.... (B. Holm 1990:606-607) The design elements of the Wolf's Lair planks differ from the standard ovoids, U-forms, negative C-shapes, T-shapes, and wedges found in formline system (M. Holm 1990:53). We may have evidence of two distinctively Northwest Coast design elements, though, rep- resented in one possible elongated wedge and two crescents. Overall, the composition of the design does not follow formline principles in that the design elements on the Wolf's Lair planks are loosely connected; there is not an uninterrupted flow of one design into the other. Yet there are a few archaeological objects 122 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24, 2000</page><page sequence="17">Wolfs Lair older than the Wolf's Lair planks that can be considered examples of the formline design. The oldest examples of formline design execut- ed in wood are the Skagit River atlatl, dated to 1700 ± 100 B.P. (Fladmark et al. 1987:9) and a red cedar handle from Lachane, dated to 1630 ± 100 B.P. (Inglis 1976:178-179). Of the latter object, M. Holm (1990:188) states, "[t]his com- position should be considered a formline although it is not quite its modern equivalent." At Ozette, Mauger (1991:1 12) described the decoration on planks as "formal" and "infor- mal." Formal decoration was well-planned, and characterized by deep and deliberate carving, inlay, and sometimes painting. In contrast, infor- mal decoration is defined as lightly cut or scratched into the plank surface with little delib- eration or forethought. Seventeen planks in the Ozette collection exhibit this informal decora- tion (Mauger 1 99 1 : 1 1 2- 1 1 4). Mauger (1991:112) stated, "[t]o all appear- ances, the informal decoration on the planks in the Ozette collection is analogous to graffiti in contemporary culture, and is of particular inter- est in that it generally is not included in discus- sions of Northwest Coast art." It is also rarely illustrated. However, we were able to examine 12 of these informally decorated planks at the Makah Cultural and Research Center. All were bench planks substantially larger than the Wolf's Lair planks, and none of these were marked with incisions or carvings similar to those of Wolf's Lair. Although the Wolf's Lair plank designs lack precision in their execution and placement, they are clearly more than "graffiti," and the application of red ochre indicates more than a casual investment. The Wolf's Lair planks may represent an archaic art style, or alternatively, a type of arti- fact production previously under- studied on the Northwest Coast. The formline design style evi- dently co-occurred with other decorative styles during the Late Holocene on the Northwest Coast. Although anthropologists have remarked that northern Northwest Coast art styles were more rigidly structured, formal, and symbolic than those of the southern Northwest Coast (Mauger 1982; B. Holm 1990; M. Holm 1990), the Wolf's Lair planks demonstrate that not all artistic production followed the formline canon in the northern area, at least not 1200 years ago. The planks suggest previously unrecognized diversity of artistic styles in the north. These findings also suggest that an evolutionary trajec- tory from simple to complex is inadequate to explain the history and prehistory of Northwest Coast art. Similarly, this study raises doubts about the usefulness of dividing the Northwest Coast into two stylistic regions, a habit of both archaeologists and art historians that originated with Boas (1927). Conclusion The Wolf's Lair investigations reinforce ear- lier assessments regarding the diversity, com- plexity, and unusual preservation of materials in southeast Alaskan cave sites (e.g., Dixon et al. 1997). The 5,000 year old wooden implement and the 1,200 year old decorated wood planks have no clear analogs in ethnographic or archae- ological collections or literature. We have been unable to assign these artifacts to clear-cut func- tional classes, since they significantly differ from known ethnographic and archaeological specimens. We have explored the possibilities suggested by their morphology, but can offer no definitive labels. The engraved and decorated planks are suggestive of an archaic art style, although it is possible that similar ethnographic pieces were rarely collected or have escaped scholarly attention. Such artifacts remind us that even though Northwest Coast art is interna- tionally famous, well-illustrated, widely exhibit- ed, and the source of inspiration for contempo- rary artists, its origins, development, and varia- tion are not well-understood. The unique Wolf's Lair artifacts also remind us that many aspects of the remarkable First Nations cultures of the Northwest Coast remain undocumented.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Early versions of this paper were presented at the 1995 Northwest Anthropological Conference in Portland and the 1995 Alaska Anthropological Association Meetings in Anchorage. We are indebted to our colleagues who participated in the 1994 SE AC AVES expe- dition (John Autrey, Jim Baichtal, Jim Dixon, Terry Fifield, Nora Foster, Tom Hamilton, and Bob Sattler) whose hard work and interpreta- tions contributed to this paper. For financial and logistical support, we are indebted to the Ketchikan Area of the Tongass National Forest and to the University of Oregon's Office of Research and Sponsored Programs. At the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, James Van Stone facilitated the exam- ination of ethnographic Northwest Coast collec- tions. Nina Gregorev of the American Museum of Natural History facilitated access to their online study collection. Jeff Mauger, Grant Keddie, Steve Henrikson, Aldona Jonaitis, Janice Klein, and Bill McLennan all provided useful ideas about the interpretation of these artifacts. We particularly appreciate the privilege of studying the Ozette collections at the Makah Cultural and Research Center, and are grateful to Janine Bowechop, Director, and the Board of Trustees for making our work possible. We thank Meredith Heilman for her keen eye in see- ing a design that had escaped us. Pam Endzweig, Valerie Phorp, Judy Logan, Scott Byram, Wayne Smith, and Helen Dewolf all provided valuable advice on conservation tech- niques for wood artifacts. The technical assistance of Nancy Stenholm, Nora Foster, Beta Analytic, and PaleoResearch Laboratories all made important contributions to this paper. We thank Mark Tveskov, Southern Oregon University, and Peter Turner, Faculty Instructional Technology Training Center at the University of Oregon, for their expertise in assisting us with illustrations. Special thanks are due Terry Fifield for his ongoing support of research on the Prince of Wales Archipelago and his willingness to fill-in gaps wherever and whenever they arise.
