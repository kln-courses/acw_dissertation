Development projects and involuntary population displacement: The World Bank's attempt to correct past failures KEVIN J.A.THOMAS Population Studies Center, University of Pennsylvania Abstract. In the past, poor rural peasants have been the unintended victims of large-scale development projects in the world's developing countries. Development projects such as dam and road construction have triggered large streams of population movements within poor countries. Policy makers such as those at the World Bank have made several attempts to tackle the problems of development-based involuntary population displacements. This paper examines some of the consequences and dynamics of development induced forced migration. It discusses the World Bank's past failure to provide adequate policies that sufficiently tackle the displacement problems that were the consequences of its past projects in Africa. The Bank's new Operational Policy on Involuntary Displacement is then evaluated in a retrospect- ive analysis of how it could have solved the population displacement problems in one of its projects, the Nangbeto Dam in Togo, West Africa. The analysis concludes that the Operational Policy could be an effective tool to tackle development induced population displacement but that it still needs a few more adjustments as a policy instrument. Introduction: Statement of the problem Constrained by an urgent desire to see rapid economic progress, many de- veloping countries, particularly some in post independence Africa, resorted to the execution of large-scale development projects in the decades follow- ing the 1960s. This vogue saw the construction of large hydroelectric power plants, commercial plantations and the like around Africa during the post in- dependence period, and was supposed to provide the investment prerequisites that paved the road to economic Utopia. Many of these undertakings however resulted in the displacement of large numbers of poor peasants, and raised a lot of questions in academic and other circles about ignored anthropomorphic and poverty alleviation issues. As the largest multi-national lending institution that financed such large- scale projects, the World Bank came under sharp criticism for the role that it played in these ventures. By virtue of the fact that it made its funds available for these projects, it was betraying its role as a moral advocate for the poor by facilitating programs that failed to seek their interests. This does not suggest that the World Bank was unaware of consequent problems of development</page><page sequence="2">340 KEVIN J. A. THOMAS related displacement from the projects it funded. However as it continued to gather records that reflected a poor handling of displacement issues, it became evident that fundamental policy changes were needed. Issues of development related displacement became very significant in the continent of Africa where involuntary resettlement was a part of more than 200 World Bank-assisted development projects over a sixteen-year period. Such resettlements resulted in an enormous burden on the host population that compounded the complexity of the displacement related problem (Cernea, 1997). The Bank then gave a perfect summation of the issues raised by invol- untary displacement from its development projects. In its view, "Involuntary resettlement may cause severe long term hardship, impoverishment, and en- vironmental damage unless appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried out" (World Bank, 2001).1 Objectives and methodology This paper's principle focus examines the World Bank's reaction to problems of involuntary resettlement in its project. Its objectives include the assessment of corrective actions it has taken to correct its past mistakes, the evolution of these actions and how relevant these measures are to a specific case in Africa. The study sees the World Bank's Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, an evolution of its former Operational Directive, as an instru- ment that could be used to solve displacement problems in World Bank's projects. This Operational Policy represents the Bank's most important step taken so far to address the problems of its past failures. A few guidelines defined by this operational policy would then be applied in a retrospective analysis of our case study, the Togo Nangbeto Dam. It must be noted that the World Bank's initial Operational Directive was instituted (in 1990) while the Nangbeto project was in progress (between 1984 and 1992). The intention here is to use this retrospective approach to assess the adequacy and utility of the Bank's latest response. The World Bank's record on involuntary displacement in Africa The World Bank in 1997 was involved in the execution of projects related to urban development, slum clearance, river displacements, highway construc- tion, forestry, agricultural development and the like in over 30 countries in Africa (Cernea, 1997). These projects brought a unique set of problems to the African continent. In documenting the population numbers involved, Cernea believes that the numbers of people displaced in the construction of just</page><page sequence="3">DEVELOPMEND PROJECTS AND INVOLUNTARY POPULATION DISPLACEMENT 341 the Akosombo, Kossou, or Kariba dams, are greater than the displacements caused in Asia by even the biggest dams of that continent. He thus believes that African nations have been affected in much more profound ways by such displacements, notwithstanding the benefits yielded by these projects (Cernea 1997). Pade Baru (1998) presents much more scathing attacks on the Bank's past failure to address involuntary displacement that result from its projects. He presents the case of Ethiopia where the World Bank supported the conversion of the Awash River Valley into huge sugar cane, cotton and banana planta- tions. Baru observes that the dams built to support these projects displaced 25,000 pastoralists who were removed from their homes and were left with no other means of supporting their traditional ways of life. He even goes as far as affirming that the Ethiopian famine of the 1980's was a by-product of the displacement of these pastorals (Baru, 1998). In the Ethiopia case, Bovard (1997) points to the World Bank's support for the country's dictatorial regime. He observes that the World Bank provided huge sums to the Ethiopian Marxist regime, which launched a massive resettlement program in the midst of the 1984-85 famine. He claims that the medical assistance group, Doctors Without Borders, affirmed that the resettlement program killed more people than the famine itself (Bovard, 1997). Baru (1998) again notes that the construction of the Kainji dam in Nigeria led to the displacement of 42,000 farmers who were forcibly removed from their homes. He suggests the zenith of the World Bank's resettlement tra- gedies by pointing to the controversial Bakolori dam. In this case the villagers who refused to be relocated were attacked by government paramilitary forces who killed a few hundreds of them. To make matters worse, this World Bank supported project collapsed as a result of poor engineering work. The result was that areas where farmers had been relocated were over-flooded, killing many of them. In fact these farmers were never compensated for the losses they incurred as a result of the flooding (Baru, 1998). The catalogue of World Bank projects that resulted in the impoverishment of the resettled population is extended by Baru to also include the Kariba dam in Zimbabwe. He claims that in this project 56,000 peasant farmers were displaced and those who refused to be relocated were massacred by the police. In the case of the Akosombo dam in Ghana, he declares that 80,000 farmers lost their homes and their livelihoods. Baru moves further to claim that in the construction of the Ruizzi Dam II in Zaire, 13,000 farmers where displaced (Baru, 1998). Cernea thus provide the points of uniqueness that define the issues raised by involuntary resettlement from development related projects (in Cernea, 1997). These points are:</page><page sequence="4">342 KEVIN J. A. THOMAS 1. Resettlement is never the primary objective of the project that causes displacement. 2. While other development projects explicitly aim to increase productivity of people's incomes, forced resettlement starts by taking away something from them. 3. Forced resettlement needs to be addressed to prevent it from generating the process of massive impoverishment and social disarticulation. Any policy that would uphold the true virtues of an unbiased approach to poverty alleviation should thus ensure that the welfare of the poor is improved in a very comprehensive way. This is very important because as Gay asserts, the life span of large dams particularly in tropical areas can be quite short (Gay, 1996). It thus makes no sense in the making of policy, to compromise the long-term survival of the poor for the short-term existence of a dam. The operational policy on involuntary resettlement The World Bank's first guidelines on involuntary resettlement were drawn up in its Operational Manual (OMS) 2.33, in the late 1970s,2, after the Bank had amassed records of inadequate resettlement policy in the execution of its projects. This manual was later developed into its Operational Directive 4.30 on involuntary resettlement that was launched in 1990. The directive defined the Bank's policy and procedures on involuntary resettlement and the conditions its clients are expected to meet in projects that have a reset- tlement component. According to the World Bank, this resettlement policy sought to ensure that the population displaced by the project receives benefit from it (The World Bank Operational Manual, Involuntary Resettlement, June 1990). It also emphasized the need for proper planning around an economic development strategy. In 1999 the World Bank increased the transparency of the involuntary resettlement policy process by requesting comments from a vast array of stakeholders including national governments, non-governmental organiza- tions and academics and also held consultations to solicit reactions to its directive. It is assumed that these comments on its Operational Directive were supposed to have influenced the eventual policy that was adopted in March 2001. In terms of its specific policy objectives, the new Operational Policy on involuntary resettlement states among other things: a. Involuntary resettlement should be avoided. b. If it cannot be avoided, resettlement activities should be executed as sus- tainable development programs in which the displaced persons share in the benefits of the project</page><page sequence="5">DEVELOPMEND PROJECTS AND INVOLUNTARY POPULATION DISPLACEMENT 343 c. Involuntary resettlement should improve the standards of living of the displaced persons or to at least replace them in real terms (World Bank, 2001).3 What one then needs to know is the extent to which this operational policy could be used to avoid repeating some of the failures of past World Bank projects. This issue is what would be addressed in the following examination of our case study World Bank project. The case study According to the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (1998), Nangbeto was the first hydropower project in Togo. This site was 160 kilo- meters upstream of the Mono River and was selected after feasibility studies, which determined that it was the only place in Togo where such a dam could be constructed (World Bank Operations Evaluation Department, 1998). The project was approved in 1984 and completed in 1992. According to the Bank, this dam and its reservoir affected 34 villages, which were predominantly close to the river, and as a result of the project 7,626 people lost their houses and land. The affected people were then relocated in nine new villages in five resettlement zones. The Bank admits that the hydro-electric project was approved without much resettlement planning as it was believed that since it would take three more years before the reservoir begins to fill up, there was no need to be in a hurry (World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department, 1998). In fact it even claims that when the plan was indeed developed it did not appear to have had much operational content. It also claims that when its resettlement advisor visited the site when the plan was being drawn, he claimed the planning process was proceeding well but that the project could possibly become a resettlement disaster. The operational policy and the nangbeto project Planning According to the new Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, the basic foundation to a successful resettlement exercise lies in appropriate plan- ning measures, which should be taken before the resettlement is carried out. Unfortunately, in the Nangbeto project, it does not seem that the planning process was given the seriousness that it deserved. The Operations and Evalu- ation Department even noted that the initial plan did not have any operational</page><page sequence="6">344 KEVIN J. A. THOMAS value, while as observed earlier, expert opinion had suggested that the whole exercise could become a "resettlement disaster". Though evaluation docu- ments show that the eventual plan used in the exercise was good, one still gets the impression that most of the other problems that emanated to the project (e.g., compensation, participation, etc) would have been avoided. This would have happened if there were good and effective pre-planning as required by the operational policy before the project even started. Improved living standards The Operational Policy also makes allowance for an improvement of the former living standards, income earning capacity and production levels of the resettled population. This provision lies at the heart of what could have been a strategic thrust to improve the lives of the poor people displaced by the Nangbeto project. The Nangbeto project did not replicate these values either. The end of project evaluation notes that short wave resettlers were not any better and suffered a great deal of land pressure and soil exhaustion. In addition they were also reported to have experienced declining acreage in production yields. As a matter of fact, some of them were so badly affected economically that they returned to their former villages near the reservoir (World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department, 1998). This same report also notes that other resettlers not only faced additional expenses but also cut off from the food assistance that was given. This seriously questions the World Bank's strategy of poverty alleviation in the resettlement issues related to the Nangbeto project. The report also notes that among other things, in- come from trees undoubtedly decreased, while livestock incomes probably decreased. It could even be posited that in the Nangbeto's peculiar case, the resettlers would have probably been better off, had the resettlement never taken place in the first place. Compensation Compensation for the loss of resettlers' assets did not only seem disorgan- ized in Nangbeto, but was also late to be disbursed. The effect was a further impoverishment of the resettled population during the interim period, some- thing the new Operational Policy seeks to eliminate. In fact the bank itself claimed that it did not seem like the resettlers were well informed about the details of the housing compensation. In addition, the local partners did not begin to compensate resettlers till 1990, three years after the resettlement had been completed.4 Pathetically, these resettlers lived in houses with insufficient cement content that also had other structural deficiencies. By the time the housing compensation was received, some of the resettlers had already built</page><page sequence="7">DEVELOPMEND PROJECTS AND INVOLUNTARY POPULATION DISPLACEMENT 345 their replacement houses and thus did not use the compensation for what it was initially intended. As a result of the fact that the resettlers had to wait for such a long time to receive their full compensation, the operations and evaluation department notes that many of them sold off household assets (bicycles, radios etc) when things got worse in the interim period. To this end, the Operational policy on resettlement now makes allow- ance for the following. It addresses the issues of publicity of the laws and regulation among the people to be displaced, of the laws and regulations gov- erning valuation and compensation, establishment of criteria for determining the resettlement eligibility of affected households and compensation at full replacement costs. The policy however, does not seem to adequately address the kinds of client negligence seen in Nangbeto in which the local partners started the compensation process so late. Integration issues The Nangbeto project documents reveal that the resettlement project did a very poor job in integrating the needs of the resettled population with that of the host population. The operations and evaluation department documents suggest that the host communities were never given any incentives for hosting the resettled population. Even though the bank provided compensation and some benefits to the resettled population, the fact that it ignored the general development needs in the host area appeared to have compromised the quality of the assistance given to resettlers. The economic hardships of the area were certainly not different that of the rest of the Togolese population during this period. This was demonstrated when some of the facilities provided for the resettled population attracted in-migrants from other poorer populations. One holds the view that this would have stretched the carrying capacity of the resettlers' facilities which would have been used by the resettlers, their hosts and the in-migrants, and thus compromised their ability to enjoy the full be- nefits of their compensation. The Operational Policy attempts to circumvent these problems by making provision for the fact that in resettlement projects, conditions and services of the host population should improve and or at least not deteriorate. It must be note however that as most development projects that induce population displacement are located in poor rural areas, the policy could work better by anticipating a large inflow of economic migrants to resettlement areas which could be in very high numbers. This would then require that resettlement projects would need to assess the broader social and economic needs that lie beyond the boundaries of the host area.</page><page sequence="8">346 KEVIN J. A. THOMAS Deriving direct benefits from the fruits of the project Cernea (1997) makes the point that in many cases of resettlement, the resettled population that bears the direct brunt and costs involved in the execution of these large projects never derive any benefits from the project itself. This point is perfectly demonstrated in the Togo Nangbeto project. One observes from the evaluation documents of the World Bank that none of the resettlers had electricity either before or after the completion of this hydroelectric project. Even though the new Operational Policy attempts to ensure that the population displaced by a project derive benefits from it, there needs to be a consideration of the mechanisms through which benefits could be addressed. Available information does not indicate why the displaced in Nangbeto did not derive direct project benefits. However it is easy to see how this could happen in some cases. Displaced populations in poor rural areas may not enjoy electricity from a dam project if they cannot afford the fixed installation costs and the recurrent costs of electricity use in the areas where they are resettled. NGO's as strategic partners The possibility of encountering major problems on policy implementation in resettlement projects from large scale development ventures could be seriously curtailed by the strategic involvement of Non-governmental organ- izations in every stage from the project's design right through the project's implementation and final evaluation. Unfortunately for the Nangbeto project, NGO's were not possible under the military dictatorship in Togo during the project's implementation (The World Bank Operations and Evaluation De- partment, 1998). Addressing the important role of NGO's turns out to be one of the very strong points of the Operational Policy. The document recognizes the fact that N.G.O.s can often provide much needed assistance and ensure viable community participation in the communication of the concerns of the host population. Non-governmental and other third party organizations can also be instru- mental in providing professional and objective monitoring and evaluation of the whole resettlement process as serious ethical issues could arise from eval- uations done by either the Bank or its clients. In this regard caution needs to be applied to the operational policy's calls for borrower monitoring and evalu- ation of the activities of the resettlement instruments as well as the monitoring of resettlement plans. As Fox and Brown (1998) note, self-evaluation is in- herently contradictory because critical self-evaluation is likely to intimidate entrenched interests and would therefore be treated as a threat. This thus calls</page><page sequence="9">DEVELOPMEND PROJECTS AND INVOLUNTARY POPULATION DISPLACEMENT 347 for independent third party evaluations of the extent to which the concerns of the poor have been adequately addressed in the Bank's resettlement project. Conclusions: Lessons learned In trying to reconcile the World Bank's dismal record on involuntary dis- placement and the solutions offered by its Operational Policy, it could be concluded the World Bank has theoretically done something to at least pro- tect the welfare and the rights of the poor. The Operational Policy seems to be a generally good tool that would address the past project lapses of World Bank's resettlement projects. That does not mean that the directive as an instrument is not without its inadequacies. The directive cannot address some of the more intangible issues of displacement. It cannot for example, address what Downing refers to as the sense of relief resettled people get by visiting the shores of a lake that covers their former homes (Downing, 1996). However the directive would be a better instrument if it would address other important issues such as the mechanics of dispensing compensation to the resettlers with speed to ensure that no time vacuum exist from the time of movement, as delays would lead to their further impoverishment. Perhaps even more important is the fact that the directive also needs to come up with tangible details about ensuring that the resettled population enjoys the benefits of the project that they had to pay a high price of in- convenience for. If for example the affected people of a hydroelectric dam project end up without electricity when the project ends, we may be forced to revive important questions about the social justice of such development projects. The World Bank's resettlement plans could be even better, if they make allowance for specific sanctions that could be levied on borrowers if the resettlement process is not being properly addressed. These sanctions could involve tying phased financial disbursements for the project to progress made in the resettlement aspects. Funds would be withheld if there are major lapses on the part of local clients in tackling resettlement issues. Perhaps the most important thing that the World Bank needs to do is to move from rhetoric to practice. The Bank needs to move to ensure that all the details of the Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement are not only implemented but also adequately evaluated after their implementation. This evaluation should by no means be confined to a self-evaluation process. By and large, from what we have observed in this study we could conclude that the World Bank has indeed come a long way in protecting the interests of the poor who are affected by its large-scale dam projects. How the new policy would solve the displacement problems that arise from development projects other than dams, would still need to be researched. However, we need to note</page><page sequence="10">348 KEVIN J. A. THOMAS that the Bank has taken positive steps to address some of the tragic failures of its past, but it still needs to do more to ensure that all the multidimensional needs of the poor affected in its projects are entirely addressed.
