<plain_text><page sequence="1">Afterlives of the Tour Saint-Jacques Plotting the Perceptual History of an Urban Fragment LAUREN M. O'CONNELL Ithaca College Asmall book on Tokyo by Yoshinobu Ashihara, called The Hidden Order (1989), has this to say about the relationships between past and present in Paris and Tokyo, and about their respective prospects for the future: Paris is a splendid, beautiful city, indeed, but may be encoun- tering difficulty when it comes to adjusting to the needs of the twenty-first century. Its masonry architecture makes it, in a way, a static and inorganic monument of the past. Tokyo, however, remains a synchronic whole, tenaciously surviving by rather an amoebic adaptability. It is an ugly, chaotic metropolis, but it is organic and constantly in the throes of change. I cannot help wishing at times that the amoeba would replicate its parts with somewhat more care, but its vigor is not to be denied.1 Lovely to look at, Ashihara's Paris is a frozen relic of past glories, its unyielding masonry architecture and pre- occupation with formal neatness rendering it incapable of accommodating change without sacrificing its nature. Tokyo, he argues, with its unregulated facades and pell mell consumerist ephemerality, has the saving flexibility to absorb change while retaining its "hidden order." Paris, straw man for the touted Tokyo, is ultimately pronounced "a city . . . where fundamental architectural change is impossible."2 Ashihara's viewpoint was not unique, nor has it with- stood challenge, yet the forcefulness of its expression con- tinues to lend it standing as a reference point. Analysis of the nineteenth and twentieth century after- lives of a single Parisian monument-the Gothic Tour Saint-Jacques-reveals such changes of meaning and func- tion as to illustrate not fixity but purposeful and fortuitous transformation, catalyzing boundless cycles of interpreta- tion. There is a sense in which the physical survival of an urban fabric over a period of time cannot, after all, be taken as an index of architectural inflexibility or resistance to change. For while the bricks and mortar may endure, the cultural values and meanings attached to them shift, often radically, over the course of time. In the language of Roland Barthes, whose poststructuralist inflection of semiotic the- ory dissolves any promise of a definitive decoding of cul- tural artifacts, "the signifieds are transient, the signifiers remain."3 A perceptual history of a given site, or a plotting of the ways in which it has been read and inhabited over time, will suggest that successive representations of a city fabric-in government documents, in journalistic accounts, in literary vignettes, and in visual imagery-have a trans- formative effect on the lived reality of that fabric. In the case at hand, it will point in particular to a sav- ing semantic flexibility that belies Ashihara's impression of Parisian stasis and affirms the ongoing relevance of inher- ited relics within the modern city. Borrowing the semiotic vocabulary of "signifier" and "signified" to artificially uncouple form and meaning and "isolate" the latter for analysis, and drawing upon poststructuralist observations about the instability of both elements of the signifying</page><page sequence="2">equation, our strategy will propose a method of estimating, as it were, the current cultural status of historic buildings in general. By extension, it will offer the possibility of grounded arguments for their integrality, or lack thereof, to the contemporary urban landscape. To construct a perceptual, rather than a specifically architectural, history of the modern lives of the Parisian Tour Saint-Jacques, we begin not at the building's incep- tion in the Middle Ages, but at the moment when it nearly disappeared for the first time. Inquiring first about the fate of a distinguished medieval parish church in the tumult of the Revolution of 1789, we go on to examine the ways in which its remnant managed to survive by constantly redefining itself for successive audiences, ultimately to emerge as an unlikely emblem of the city and the culture that nearly destroyed it numerous times (Figure 1). Monuments and Memory Before taking up telling episodes in the tower's semantic evolution, it may be worthwhile to frame the investigation in conceptual, and specifically museological, terms, for the fate of this structure is linked to that widely pervasive and characteristic activity of modem society that is the museum, broadly conceived. Common to most understandings of the museum phenomenon is the notion of collecting-of defin- ing, preserving, and displaying a corpus of objects or rep- resentations, to whatever end. The urge to collect, and the motivations that underlie it, undergird the story of the Tour Saint-Jacques, which has been collected in two senses of the term. As will be seen below, in the wake of its near destruc- tion by French revolutionaries, it was gathered, with other Gothic relics, under the rubric of "monuments to be con- served for artistic reasons," thereby taking part in the ear- liest efforts on the part of the French nation to name (or collect) and protect an architectural patrimony-a corpus of buildings viewed as a shared and inviolate heritage. In another, metaphysical, dimension the tower has been col- lected over the course of its storied history through graphic and photographic representation-so frequently that the history of its image is as separately interesting as the story of its materiality. One might intercross the concept of collecting with that of "fixing," to speak as well of a bivalent "fixing" of the Tour Saint-Jacques. Paralleling its collection by conserva- tion are the physical "fixes" of repeated restoration, which worked continually to reinvent the monument; in recon- ceiving its physical setting, city planners revised its rela- tionship to memory, and thus its social and cultural role. And the two levels of collecting or fixing-physical and Figure 1 The Tour Saint-Jacques in Paris, attributed to Jehan de Felin, 1508-1522, photographed in its late-nineteenth-century setting, the landscaped Square Saint-Jacques visual-are conceptually and historically linked: the scores of efforts to "fix" the Tour Saint-Jacques in time and space through graphic representation have their origins in a spe- cific episode in the development of the concept of architec- tural patrimony. In the history of the establishment of a historic heritage to be protected, an early stage is the "col- lection" of that heritage by way of figural representation. Before Europe undertook to protect its monuments through legislation, it sought to preserve them by recording their appearance for posterity in engravings and printed albums. The voluminous iconography of the Tour Saint- Jacques played a role, ultimately, in "fixing" its status as an urban icon that the twentieth century dared not assault. An additional conceptual thread introduced here, that of memory, will anchor this rumination on the changing fortunes of an individual monument within a larger specu- lation on the how and why of heritage making and the link- age between our perceptions of the past and our psychic AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 451</page><page sequence="3">status in the present. A recent study of the history of atti- tudes toward the architectural past, Francoise Choay's The Invention of the Historic Monument, quotes Ruskin on the relationship between monuments and memory: "We may live without [architecture], and worship without her, but we cannot remember without her."4 As Choay notes, Ruskin regarded architecture as "our only means of keeping alive a tie to the past, a past to which we owed our very identity, and which formed a constituent part of our being."5 The tie to identity is crucial; in Choay's construct, the urge to col- lect and preserve an architectural heritage, and the avidity with which that cult is currently practiced, points to a psy- chic crisis in contemporary society. We look to the "patri- monial mirror" for a memory of ourselves, for an image that would root us in time and space at a moment when both seem to elude our grasp. "The architectural monument," she writes, echoing Ruskin, calls upon the faculty of memory. The affective nature of its purpose is essential: it is not simply a question of informing, of calling to mind a neutral bit of information, but rather of stirring up, through the emotions, a living memory. . . . But the past that is invoked and called forth, in an almost incantatory way, is not just any past: it is localized and selected to a critical end, to the degree that it is capable of directly contributing to the main- tenance and preservation of the identity of an ethnic, religious, national, tribal or familial community. For those who erect it, as for those who receive its messages, the monument is a defense against the traumas of existence, a security measure.6 This memorial role of the architectural monument is evoked by one of the most stunning photographic traces of the Tour Saint-Jacques, which will serve to focus our analy- sis on the particularities of its case (Figure 2). Produced by surrealist photographer Brassai during a nocturnal foray into the sinister crannies of the historic city, the picture shows the tower looming in the misty distance. Viewed from the rooftop of Notre Dame Cathedral, the tower's evanescent bulk acts as counterpoint to a hulking repoussoir gargoyle standing sentry in the foreground. Brassai glosses the image in a 1976 preface to the collection in which it appears, a series of 1930s photographs of "secret Paris," revealing the seamy underside of the cosmopolitan city. He explains that he initially took the pictures, and then much later decided to publish them, in an effort to preserve a fleeting moment in Parisian history: To the present generation, some of these pictures will certainly seem as exotic as if they were of pygmies or Zulus. Even more so. This is because in our century's mad rush, style, morals, Figure 2 Brassa', "Nocturnal View from Notre Dame overlooking Paris and the Tour Saint-Jacques," 1933. "To the present generation, some of these pictures will certainly seem as exotic as if they were of pygmies or Zulus," wrote their maker of his photographic attempt to fix an ephemeral Paris. From The Secret Paris of the 30's (New York, 1976) customs, art itself, have all been subjected to an unprecedented acceleration. Everything changes in a few years, and in a half- century everything has become far away, unrecognizable. Pierre Mac Orlan has already complained that nothing remained to testify to the experiences of his youth. "The almost total dis- appearance of everything picturesque," he wrote, "which formed the most touching part of life in 1900, is a fact."7 Photography, in this context, functions as an aid to memory. So too, Brassai's text elsewhere suggests, does the architec- tural environment depicted, allowing us to conjure collec- tive memories of a still earlier Paris. Like Choay's "incantatory" action of monuments, or Ruskin's "we can- not remember without her," Brassai evokes the Proustian power of historic urban fabric to reconnect us with our past: "The half-dressed girl strutting along the Rue des Lom- bards, picking up passers-by, murmurs the same 'Want to come with me?' as the streetwalkers murmured to the rakes 452 JSAH / 60:4, DECEMBER 2001</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3 "Paris in 1860, view of the Saint-Gervais Quarter," showing the location of the Tour Saint-Jacques at lower right, on the Seine's Right Bank. The view is taken from the east, placing the Hotel de Ville in the lower right corner, the Louvre-Tuileries compound above the tower near center right, and the Cathedral of Notre Dame to its left on the lie de la Cite. From Philippe Benoist, Paris dans sa splendeur (Paris, 1861) in the fourteenth century. She walks the same sidewalks as they did, the same pavement, stands on the same corners."8 The Tour Saint-Jacques owes its existence to this phe- nomenon. Located on the Parisian Right Bank, near the River Seine, the tower rises due north of the Ile de la Cite, framed by the Louvre to the west and the H6tel de Ville to the east (Figure 3). It is today a centerpiece of the Chatelet quarter, named for the prison that once dominated it. Its for- tunes in the modern era are tied to the French Revolution, one of whose signal effects, from an architectural point of view, was the wholesale transformation of centuries-old pat- terns of ownership and building function in the French city.9 Destruction, Conservation, and the French Revolution As is well known, the revolutionary government confiscated all properties held by the royalty, the aristocracy, and the Church, which represented an enormous architectural windfall to be refitted for national use. Not immediately finding functions for the entire built legacy of the Old Regime, and in dire need of cash to pay off staggering debts and prop up a failed economy, it proceeded to sell off scores of Old Regime buildings to the highest bidders. The medieval Church of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie was sold in 1797 to an entrepreneur who made no secret of his inten- tion to demolish the useless Gothic hulk and redevelop the land in some profit-making way. A small church built in the twelfth century, its name "de la Boucherie" reflects the con- centration of butchers residing in the quarter in medieval times (Figure 4).10 The sale of the church passed unnoticed, and it was soon demolished, as shown in DeMachy's nos- talgic watercolor (Figure 5). But one government architect, Pierre Giraud, did express alarm about the potential loss of the spectacular tower that had been attached to the church in the sixteenth century. He wrote a letter to his superior in the city government, who forwarded it to the Minister of the Interior, responsible for preserving certain national treasures. The minister appealed to his council of architec- tural advisors, the Conseil des Batiments Civils: Should the AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 453</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4 The Church of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, begun in the twelfth century and substantially modified thereafter. Jean-Frangois Garnerey's 1784 engraving records the structure's flamboyant appearance, reflecting sixteenth-century alterations, thirteen years before the tower was stranded by the sale and demolition of the church. government intervene on the tower's behalf? According to Giraud, the structure had considerable artistic and practical value; it was of a "pure" Gothic style and, because of its great height, could be used for what he called "geographic operations."11 Members of the Conseil concurred that these virtues militated in favor of conserving the tower, if possi- ble; they left open, however, the question of how this might be achieved while fairly indemnifying its rightful buyer. A year later they revisited the question, this time taking up each of Giraud's defenses in detail. They paid close atten- tion at this second meeting to the monetary value of this "beautiful Gothic monument," noting that, according to Giraud, its materials alone were worth more than the assigned value of the tower. On this occasion, the Conseil took positive action and, using newly won authority, resolved to save the tower by reimbursing the buyer for the value of the tower's materials and the land it occupied in Figure 5 Pierre Antoine DeMachy, "Demolition de Saint-Jacque [sic] la Boucherie," 179?, one of a series of watercolors by the artist documenting the decimation of the French patrimony in the revolutionary era exchange for his promise not to demolish the structure.12 So the tower was spared when the adjoining church was demolished, and it became the awkward loner we see today. The Conseil's interest in the tower's plight was part of a larger pattern of concern prompted by the sale of clerical and aristocratic properties under the Directorial govern- ment, and this first rescue brings to light an unpublished early episode in the emergence of the concept of the "his- toric monument" in France. The specter of this sudden divestment prompted that government to launch several initiatives in 1796 to define and protect a corpus of "mon- uments to be conserved for artistic reasons" (monuments a conserver sous le rapport de l'art). These measures included the creation of a special category, within the attributions of the Ministry of the Interior, of buildings that, due to their value to "the arts," should fall under that ministry's protec- tive jurisdiction rather than that of the Ministry of Finance, 454 JSAH / 60:4, DECEMBER 2001</page><page sequence="6">which might otherwise sell them to speculators.13 With this came the appointment, three decades before Guizot, of France's first inspector of historic monuments, or "archi- tect of monuments and buildings conserved for artistic rea- sons" (architecte des monuments et edifices conserves sous le rapport de l'art).14 Finally, to identify and claim the build- ings that would enjoy state protection, the Minister of the Interior, through the agency of the Conseil, launched a nationwide survey of "cathedral churches and others worthy of conservation" (eglises cathedrales et autres qui meritent d'etre conserves) in August of 1796.15 The Tour Saint-Jacques was one of the first structures to test the efficacy of these measures. A meeting in 1799 records the Conseil's attempt to draw up a definitive list of "monuments to be conserved," inspired apparently by con- tinued territorial conflicts between the ministries of Inte- rior and Finance. Conseil member Antoine-Frangois Peyre, named to the post of Inspector of Monuments in 1797, reported to his colleagues that the Minister of the Interior was trying to wrest certain threatened monuments away from the precarious purview of his colleagues at Finance: A great number of these buildings, the admiration of artists and foreigners, have been destroyed, others have been sold off or sublet, and the remainder abandoned to destructive occupants who have done more to alter these monuments than would have the ravages of enemies or long years.16 During the course of that meeting, the Tour Saint-Jacques was proposed as a candidate for the Conseil's short list. With building names desacralized in the revolutionary spirit, that list would include, in one scenario: "the Domed churches of the Invalides, the Quatre Nations, Val-de- Grace, the Sorbonne, the new Madeleine, the Franciade Church [Saint-Denis], the Portes Denis and Martin, Sulpice or the Temple des Victoires, the pedestals of the Place de la Concorde, including the central one, the Tour Jacques la Boucherie."'7 Ironically, by the end of the same session the tower had been deleted from the list, without discussion. It was not included in the official motion made by architect member Antoine-Laurent-Thomas Vaudoyer,'8 perhaps because its conservation had already been guaranteed by the 1797 agreement with the buyer. Charged as it was with the task of constructing an architectural patrimony, the Conseil found itself engaged in the late 1790s in a systematic reappraisal of the values associated with the architectural inheritance of the Old Regime. In the process, they redefined what were once liv- ing "monuments" of Old Regime despotism and supersti- tion as "historic monuments," that is, neutral historical and pedagogical documents of French artistic genius. The lex- icon is Riegl's;19 Francoise Choay invokes it in The Invention of the Historic Monument, which supplies a point of departure for this study. Choay's work traces and explicates the values that have been attached to the architectural heritage of the past by different cultures over time, and explores the rela- tionships between these often conflicting values and the treatment of inherited buildings. Ultimately, Choay addresses herself, by implication, to the policy makers and custodians of cultural assets in the present day, urging them to a greater self-consciousness about these values as they inform, often unwittingly, decisions about the fate of our architectural heritage. While Choay's work is broadly historiographic in scope, focused on overarching cultural attitudes, especially in France, England, and Italy, and on the theoretical con- tributions of key architectural thinkers in these countries, it can be seen to suggest an approach to the study of individ- ual historic buildings. My study takes up this suggestion, deploying Choay's taxonomy of values within the context of a single monument, whose reception history it pursues over the longue duree. The Tour Saint-Jacques is, in fact, a compelling case study of the process of monumental drift, redefining itself and its value every few decades in the next century in order to make itself indispensable to each new generation of city dwellers. Residents of prerevolutionary Paris valued the tower as a living monument to religious faith, part of a func- tioning church, but when the Revolution abolished religious worship, the tower's advocates had to find a new way to jus- tify its existence. Giraud's 1797 plea on the tower's behalf was pitched in the practical and art-historical terms of the "historic monument": on the practical side he cited the sci- entific possibilities offered by its great height and the mon- etary value of its materials; on the art-historical side he praised its stylistic purity and its great antiquity, thus pro- moting it as living witness to a lost and admirable chapter in the nation's artistic past. Save it not because we still believe in it, Giraud argued, but because it is a trace of our lost past. Perceptions of the Tour Saint-Jacques: Toward a History of Attitudes and Their Implications The values that Giraud attached to the tower had been rec- ognized already by writers of guides to Paris in the eigh- teenth century. They tended to remark on the quality of its workmanship, and on the fact that it was an unusual late example of the "flamboyant" style of Gothic architecture, built at the time when the more simple lines of Italian AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 455</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6 Ferrier's "View of the Hotel de Ville and the extension of the Rue de Rivoli from the Tour Saint-Jacques," one of many taken from the tower in the nineteenth century, attests to the inspectional value of its uncommon height, which continues to recommend it as a photographic locale. Renaissance form were starting to take over in Paris. And all remarked on the tower's great height. Henri Sauval wrote in 1724 that "from the height of the tower you can see the dis- tribution and the flow of all the streets, just like the veins in the human body."20 A nineteenth-century photograph taken from the top of the tower, which remains today a prime perch for Parisian image-makers, surveys the city just as Sauval described it (Figure 6). Germain Brice also highlighted the panoptic value of the tower's height; in the context of a description of the church to which it was attached, Brice wrote of a well-constructed but tastelessly overornamented tower, "from whose height one can discern the entire expanse of the city" far better than from any other viewpoint.21 A nineteenth-century architectural writer named Troche, like Brice before him, was cool to the tower's aes- thetic charms, finding it lacking in "elegance" and "light- ness."22 But he, too, remarked on the tower's unrivaled altitude. Quoting Sauval on the inspectional value of the view from the tower, Troche mentions as well the view of the tower from the city: "This height allows the tower to be seen not just from the left bank of the Seine, but from all parts of Paris."23 By calling attention to the tower's looming profile on the cityscape, Troche gives it more than local neighborhood significance. In his reading, it becomes an emblem of Paris at large, a citywide landmark, a nodal point around which the city can orient itself. It was just this larger urban role that would allow the tower to stay afloat through the massive urban renewal efforts conducted by Haussmann and Napoleon III at mid-century. Napoleon's Challenge The first postrevolutionary challenge came in 1809, when Napoleon I proposed to connect the Louvre Museum to a projected Place de la Bastille with a grand ceremonial east- west axis, modestly conceived as the "Great Imperial Way."24 The relationship between the two can be seen in a later engraving showing the view from the Bastille site, where the July Column now stands, to the Louvre (Figure 7). Piercing the street would involve razing numerous res- idential and commercial buildings, which seems to have elicited no protest. But more significantly for the Tour Saint-Jacques, the emperor's architects wished to be sure that vistas between the two monumental termini would be clear and unobstructed. The Conseil des Batiments Civils was assembled once again, to study the feasibility of such an intervention. The Conseil conducted an elaborate exper- iment that involved erecting a surveying staff on the pedi- ment of the Louvre and a flagged mast at the Bastille site and taking sightings along the proposed corridor. Check- 456 JSAH / 60:4, DECEMBER 2001</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7 Jules Arnout, view of Paris in 1845, looking west from the Place de la Bastille, showing Alavoine and Duc's July Column of 1840 in the foreground, the Louvre in the center distance, and the Tour Saint-Jacques, whose 50-meter height equaled that of the new column, between them. From Arnout, Voyage aerien en France (Paris, 1845), pi. 52 ing first its right (south) edge, they expressed concern about the domed seventeenth-century Church of Saint-Louis- des-Jesuites, which intruded on the line of sight by a meter or so. They concluded, however, that this minor encroach- ment would not unduly mar the prospect from one end of the proposed avenue to the other, and that the cherished "Grande Jesuites" was not to be tampered with. The mem- bers then surveyed the proposed street's left flank, and recorded that no significant structure would interfere with its vistas. In the space of the street itself, however, the sur- veyors discovered an offending mass, and in a startling foot- note to the right side/left side experiment, noted the problematic location of the 50-meter Tour Saint-Jacques. Reversing its prior benevolent attitude toward the tower, the Conseil now drily recommended that "the Tour Saint- Jacques, falling right in the hollow of the street, would block the view and impede traffic. We think for this reason that it is absolutely necessary that it be demolished"25 (Figure 8). Fortunately for the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Conseil's dis- missive advice was not heeded. Rambuteau's Rescue By 1836 the government had reversed itself once again, this time by resolving to buy the tower back from its private owners (who had been using it as a shot tower, causing two damaging fires) and feature it in a new plan for the embell- ishment of the quarter (Figures 9, 10).26 The rescue, presided over by Prefect Claude Philibert, comte de Ram- buteau, marks the second time that the Tour Saint-Jacques benefited from pioneering governmental preservation efforts. Some notion of the extraordinary character of Ram- buteau's reclamation can be read in the city government's accounts for the period in question. In 1843 the Revue generale de l'architecture et des travaux publics published an analysis of the city's public expenditures, the gist of which was to promote greater outlays for architectural projects. Under the heading "major architectural projects" (grands travaux d'architecture) for the nine-year period 1831 to 1840, only five sites are mentioned by name (all others are listed by generic category): the Place Royale (85,000 francs), the Place de la Concorde (1,500,000), the Palais des Thermes AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 457</page><page sequence="9">Figure 8 A later graphic, from 1856, shows the two structures found to intrude upon the rue de Rivoli extension proposed in 1809.

Although the published accounting does not itemize outlays year by year, when calculated against the total expenditure for the nine-year period, the tower would seem to have cost the city more than 10 percent of its architec- tural-projects budget for a single year.27 The precedent-setting nature of the prefect's effort is also readable in the tower's later invocation as an example of successful state action on the patrimonial behalf. In 1841, the now fortunate tower is foregrounded in an excerpt of Commission des Monuments Historiques proceedings, in which the Minister of the Interior entreats the Parisian municipal council to conserve certain structures: On the advice of the Commission on Historic Monuments, the Minister of the Interior has specifically recommended to the Prefect of the Seine several remarkable Parisian monuments that are threatened with demolition, and which should be the object of a steadfast solicitude by the Municipal Council, to which the Tour Saint-Jaccques-la-Boucherie, the Church of Saint-Germain-I'Auxerrois, etc. are indebted for having been saved from imminent ruin.28 Twenty years later, by which time the concept of gov- ernmental preservation initiative had taken root in France, the sparing of the Tour Saint-Jacques was still held up as a model, albeit in somewhat disparaging terms. Guilhermy, author of the scholarly Parisian guidebook Itineraire archeologique de Paris, alludes to the Saint-Jacques in a lament over the destruction of a tower he much preferred, the austerely Cistercian Tour Latran (also called Bichat), which had once stood opposite the College de France: The city of Paris, which made such generous sacrifices to save the Tour Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, showed itself, to the con- trary, to be indifferent toward that of Latran, and nonetheless, if the former enjoys a greater renown, the other belongs to a better period of art and was part of family of buildings of a more interesting character.29 Guilhermy's remark was picked up soon after by preservation architect and theorist/historian Viollet-le- Duc. While not including the Tour Saint-Jacques among notable French towers in his Dictionnaire, the celebrated Gothic aficionado mentions its extraordinary rescue in pass- ing, by quoting the Guilhermy reference verbatim in a foot- note to his own discussion of the lost Tour Latran.30 What motivated Prefect Rambuteau's historic pur- chase? His justification for the buyback made a nod to the tower's artistic and historical merits, but cannot his interest in it be read as having had more to do with its potential as an urban ornament, an attractive accessory for the new suit of clothes he had planned for the Arcis ward? The preser- vationist and urban embellishment objectives are thor- oughly intertwined in his explanation: The municipal government, whose interests encompass every- thing that might contribute to the splendor of the capital, has just completed the acquisition of the Tour Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie. This tower, in a perfect state of conservation and one of the most remarkable of our monuments of the Middle Ages, is destined one day to contribute to the embellishment of a neighborhood that has heretofore been extremely encum- bered, and which will take on a new appearance within the next few years thanks to the street piercings projected by the admin- istration .. .31 While the tower's status as a "remarkable" medieval monument is creatively being reinforced here, it is clear that its particular history was no longer reason enough to save it; rather, its survival had come to depend upon its ability to transform itself, in the governmental mind, into a spectac- ular bit of street furniture.32 Rambuteau's action marks a subtle but decisive turning point in the perceptual history of the Tour Saint-Jacques, which is at this point on the verge of moving beyond the mutation from "monument" to "his- toric monument" and into the semantically impoverished realm of background amenity. Haussmann's Redefinition Rambuteau's treatment of the tower as servant of a pro- jected (but not completed) urban embellishment scheme laid the groundwork for Haussmann's decision two decades later to use the tower to anchor vistas in a reworked Chatelet quarter.33 At the behest of Napoleon III, and building upon the initiatives of his predecessors, Baron Haussmann, named Prefect of the Seine in 1853, undertook to remake Paris for the modern age, by straightening, widening and leveling its medieval streets, and by unifying their facades with grandly consistent stone elevations. One of Haussmann's most conspicuous achievements was the accomplishment of a great central intersection where major north-south and east-west boulevards would cross, provid- ing a focal point for the city. The grande croisee, a presence in the city's imaginaire since at least the reign of Charles V (1364-1380), and promoted by Haussmann and Napoleon III with reference to an apocryphal originary cardo and decumanus, would occur just above the Ile de la Cite at the AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 459</page><page sequence="11">Figure 11 "Major elements of the Parisian street system," showing Haussmann's legacy of diagonal boulevards calculated to link and extend existing arteries and incorporate significant monuments and squares. The system's fulcrum is a central grande croisee, at the Place du Chatelet. From Norma Evenson, Paris: A Century of Change (New Haven, 1979) site of the former Chatelet prison, now the Place du Chatelet.34 The Chatelet sector is most familiar to the mod- ern visitor from beneath, as designation for a major hub of the Metro and RER systems situated just to the north of the Place (Figure 11). The Tour Saint-Jacques plot lay squarely at the epi- center of the planned crossing, and would loom promi- nently over the northeast corner of the projected central place. Surrounded by residences and market stalls that had cropped up over the preceding decades (Figure 12), its worth was once again called into question. Again, although it managed to survive, it was no longer as a living monu- ment to religious devotion, nor even as a prized "historic monument" of past artistic achievements and practical potential. Rather, under Haussmann's tenure, the tower was redefined as a visual linchpin for the refurbished city center. Its superior height would serve it again, this time as a land- mark announcing the great crossing from afar, and pic- turesquely anchoring cross-axial views through the newly constructed Place du Chatelet. To confirm its new status as a key player on Hauss- mann's urban stage, it was deemed insufficient simply to spare the tower from demolition; it would now be a candi- date for the far more aggressive approach of restoration. Rambuteau had already recommended this course of action in 1847, citing insalubrious conditions in its crowded neigh- borhood and the antiquarian interest of its "curious archi- tecture" and "most interesting symbolic sculptures."35 But it took the powerful political stability of the Hauss- mann/Napoleon III partnership, and the impetus of the Exposition of 1855, which prompted the city to fast-track numerous construction projects, to bring that restoration plan to fruition. Indeed, so convinced was the prefect of the tower's importance to the scheme that he carried out an extremely costly and labor-intensive reconstruction.

Edouard Bal- dus records this step in a stark image dated 1852, one of a series documenting the fervor of degagement that would "liberate" scores of monuments from their contexts over the next several decades (Figure 14).36 Restoration of the newly isolated structure would involve raising the entire edifice on temporary stilts to insert a new foundation and level the butte on which it perched.37 Its sculptural embellishments, which had been damaged and, in some cases, removed some sixty years earlier during the Revolution, were restored, as was its fire-damaged interior. Baldus's 1858 photograph of the tower (Figure 15), a pendant to his own "before" view, captures the transforming effect of the restoration, which was carried out by architect Theodore Ballu. Baldus himself may have preferred the pristine version; Barry Bergdoll notes that he replaced the demolition photograph with that of the restored tower on his own stock list, as though to erase the ravages of time and revolution.38 As intended, the refreshed tower became a centerpiece of the redesigned quarter, marking the "great crossing" of the rue de Rivoli and the boulevard Sebastopol, where that axis carries across the Seine and over to the boulevard Saint- Figure 13 Woodcut shows accreted residences and surrounding market stalls razed at mid-century.

Benoist's 1860 bird's-eye view looking westward along the right bank (see Figure 3) reveals the Tour Saint- Jacques's pivotal position in the Haussmannian undertak- ing; in it the rue de Rivoli unfolds east to west from the lower right corner; the Tour Saint-Jacques marks the zone where it meets the north-south boulevard Sebastopol, emerging from middle right. If viewed from the Left Bank, the tower rises to the right of the elegant Place du Chatelet, punctuating the urban panorama with an imposing vertical stroke. Both Baldus and Marville captured this particular view, which became a classic Paris scene, on film. The Bal- dus version, one of a series of ninety-five small-format views of Paris likely marketed to the broad public, draws atten- tion to the tower's enhanced urban status.39 Characteristi- cally crisp and architectonic in its organization, the image settles on the central figure of the Tour Saint-Jacques, whose powerful gravitational field appears to hold sur- rounding elements in equipoise (Figure 16).

The bureaucratic gesture "restored" no sacral aura; instead of recuperating lost meaning, the Tour Saint- Jacques would find itself officially classified as a "civic mon- ument" in an 1855 report on city construction projects, formalizing its desacralized status.40 Haussmann further dis- tanced it from its original identity by recasting the former church belltower as a scientific curiosity, erecting at its base a statue of the philosopher/scientist Pascal, who supposedly conducted barometric pressure experiments there in the seventeenth century. To complete the tower's transforma- tion from signifying monument to background amenity, Haussmann ordered that it be surrounded by attractive greenery in the form of a gated public park.

From Benoist, Paris dans sa splendeur of a lost aesthetic").45 In Troche's view, the only way to restore some modicum of appropriate meaning to "this Gothic obelisk," as he called it, would be to reinvest it with some new, useful purpose.46 Functional fountains might be placed around its base; its bells might be restored and keyed to a four-faced clock, "in memory of those pious tones that glad- dened the hearts of our ancestors."47 Ironically, the tower did, by end of the nineteenth century, find a practical raison d'etre. In echo of Giraud's 1797 suggestion that it might serve "des operations geographiques," the tower's famous stature won for it the role of meteorological station. An 1893 travel account confirms that by this time the tower had become as semantically drained as Troche feared, and that Alphand's intervention had the effect of turning it into a massive lawn ornament (Figure 18). "The Tour S. Jacques is an excellent example of what may be done with the remaining portions of demolished buildings," wrote Londoner Sophia Beale: As it stands, surrounded by gardens, it is a most beautiful object, an oasis in the desert of streets, and trams, and omnibuses, a quiet spot where children may skirmish, and mothers can sit in the open air and knit their stockings. Why cannot we do likewise in London? If churches must be felled to the ground, why cannot we leave their towers as a centre to the burial-ground gardens, or remove and re-erect them in our parks? We might with advantage follow the example of Paris, both in the preservation of the old tower of S. Jacques and in the arrangement of the garden of the Hotel Cluny, where, also, fragments of churches are set up as ornaments.48 Monuments and Modernism: Le Corbusier's Tour Saint-Jacques Beale's admiration for the isolated tower in the garden con- nects curiously with another unlikely endorsement, by architect Le Corbusier. As protagonist of the Modern Movement in France, he might not be expected to find value in this florid remnant of the Gothic past. Specifically, Le Corbusier's 1925 Plan Voisin for Paris proposed to raze the city's medieval core to make way for a "radiant city" of the future (Figure 19).49 But the Tour Saint-Jacques figures prominently in Le Corbusier's conception of the future Paris: as formal prototype for the "horizontal skyscraper" isolated in a bed of grass, and as inviolate heritage, deliber- ately exempted from demolition. Le Corbusier's appreciation of the tower's formal qual- ities is explicit, for example, in the 193 5 publication La Ville Radieuse. Using the juxtaposed paste-up style familiar from Vers une architecture of 1923, he contrasts the Tour Saint- Jacques with the Gothic revival Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh over the following captions: "Tour Saint-Jacques: Medieval Paris," versus "An American university (can you believe it?). What childishness!" (Figure 20).50 The Parisian/American comparison argues right and wrong approaches to the problem of skyscraper design: the Tour Saint-Jacques, along with Notre Dame Cathedral, on another page, is lauded for its well-proportioned Cartesian clarity. "The essential grace of Paris lies in its straight lines,"51 he writes, deploring the complex massing of the Pittsburgh building (and ignoring the convolutions of sculptural detail that had offended some Tour Saint-Jacques 464 JSAH / 60:4, DECEMBER 2001</page><page sequence="16">Figure 19 Le Corbusier's "Plan Voisin," photomontage exhibited in 1925: "The axis of the undertaking was well chosen: you can see the Tour Saint-Jacques, which has been spared." From Le Corbusier, The Radiant City (Paris, 1935) observers in the past). A few pages later, next to a picture of the ungainly Beauvais Cathedral (also an architectural amputee, having lost its nave to early structural collapse), Le Corbusier again justifies his own radical scheme, and in particular the dwarfing scale of his proposed 200-meter gratte-ciels, with reference to France's medieval past: "To be raised above the mass of average things was not a sign of arrogance but an expression of dignity."52 "There are those who may laugh at this,"53 Le Cor- busier's argument concludes, presciently anticipating the reaction of at least one late-twentieth-century architect- auteur. In his passionate and heretical 1978 manifesto Deliri- ous New York, Rem Koolhaas reproduces Le Corbusier's Tour Saint-Jacques/Cathedral of Learning illustration (Fig- ure 21), and jeeringly dissects the modernist's Platonic tow- ers in phrases that come uncannily close to describing the Tour Saint-Jacques in its lush Alphand surround. Borrow- ing images from Le Corbusier's books, Koolhaas refers to "these Cartesian Skyscrapers implanted in their park,"54 "marooned in grass ... spaced out beyond any possible asso- ciation," "stripped" and "isolated" in a nonurban nightmare. Le Corbusier's modernist tower "turns into a Cartesian abstraction," the "jungle" of normal urban activity is trans- formed "into a carpet of green vegetation that is supposed to hold the Cartesian Skyscrapers together."55 Compare a nineteenth-century tour guide paean to the refurbished Tour Saint-Jacques in its salubrious new setting: "This interesting structure now occupies the centre of an elegant square laid out as a garden, once intersected by the filthiest streets of the metropolis, haunted by vendors of rags and other commodities of a similar nature."56 "No trace here of New York's soul-destroying metropolitan wilderness," Koolhaas's jibe continues, quoting Le Corbusier again, on his verdant skyscraper city: You are under the shade of trees. Vast lawns spread all around you. The air is clean and pure; there is hardly any noise.... What? You cannot see where the buildings are? Look through the charmingly diapered arabesques of branches out into the sky toward those widely spaced crystal towers that soar higher than any pinnacle on earth. Those translucent prisms that seem to float in the air without anchorage to the ground, flashing in summer sunshine, softly gleaming under grey winter skies, magically glittering at nightfall, are huge blocks of offices .. 57 The picturesque parkiness and hyper-cleansed streetscape of the Corbusian city, as read by Koolhaas, resonates so strik- ingly with the Tour Saint-Jacques literature, that one is tempted to seek evidence that the tower, in its isolated and landscaped early-twentieth-century setting, might have had a role in the formulation ofLe Corbusier's vision (Figure 22). Such a speculation is supported in some measure by two of his crucial urban texts. In Vers une architecture, the Tour Saint-Jacques is selected for montage onto the steamship Aquitania-with Notre Dame Cathedral, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Opera-to dramatize the colossal scale of modern engineering feats through comparison with the stagnant academism of received traditions in architec- ture ("But our daring and masterly constructors of AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 465</page><page sequence="17">Figure 20 Charles Klauder's University of Pittsburgh Cathedral of Learning: "What child's play!" when pitted against the graceful clarity of the Tour Saint-Jacques.

Below a large reproduction of the Plan Voisin model, Le Corbusier writes: "The axis of the undertaking was well chosen: you can see the Tour Saint- Jacques, which has been spared. Above, in the future place, you see the Porte Saint-Denis and the Porte Saint-Mar- tin."59 And indeed, the tower is carefully retained in the model, visible just off the still recognizable Place du Chatelet, behind paired modern towers (see Figure 19). Sketch representations of the Voisin scheme's later itera- tions confirm Le Corbusier's intention to incorporate the historical tower, along with selected other monuments, into his future Paris (Figure 23). As Thordis Arrhenius has recently argued, Le Cor- busier reserves for these remnants privileged status as cher- ished remainders, not in a gesture of historical tokenism, but in a positive effort to integrate, in vertical, sectional lay- ers, the city of the future with valuable vestiges of its past.60 As explicated by Arrhenius, a series of "carefully framed heritage vignettes" would be "rescued" in the plan from the fetid conditions of the congested present, and reinserted into the future city, isolated in a ground-level park and woven through the pilotis supporting new fabric above.61 In compelling support of his new interpretation, Arrhenius reprints, in color, a plan of the Plan Voisin that has typically been shown in black and white. The color version drama- tizes the importance of the historical monuments, which leap out of a black-and-white ground in deep red.62 Chal- lenging assumptions about Le Corbusier's "dismissive atti- tude toward the past," Arrhenius demonstrates the interdependence of past and future in Le Corbusier's thought and, in particular, a "strategy of conservation through destruction" that is consistent with, if an extreme version of, conflicts intrinsic to the modern preservation project itself.63 Arrhenius points to "a logic of restoration which oscillates between the conflicting demands of tran- sience and permanence."64 He explains: the modern atti- tude toward the past struggles between poles defined by Riegl in the early twentieth century. The one, a cult of "age- value," implies a laissez-faire conservation approach, allow- ing traces of the past to show their age, to fall to ruin, and even ultimately to vanish. The cult of historical value, on the other hand, implies an opposite, interventionist treat- ment, in which patrimonial elements are repaired, renewed, and fixed in time, as permanent witnesses.65 AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 467</page><page sequence="19">Figure 23 "Far from the witnesses of the past gathered on the banks of the river, four major architectural events will be set in a large space, to the glory of a civilization which, far from abdicating, has found a new direction." From Le Corbusier, La maison des hommes (1942). The Tour Saint- Jacques bears witness, cornered by the Cathedral of Notre Dame, La Sainte Chapelle, and two major Corbusian events. Le Corbusier's conception, in Arrhenius's view, resolves the permanence/transience conflict spatially. In the name of historical value, selected monuments are assembled in museological fashion, laid out in a linear sequence on a "table of memory" beneath the new city. But in recognition of their "age-value," their status as defunct traces of an irre- trievable past, their basement-level sepulcher is to be under- stood as a cemetery: "Beneath the new city the past would lay out its remains, exposed to descending visitors as if in an open grave."66 Arrhenius's characterization of Le Cor- busier's deadened monuments (among them, the Tour Saint-Jacques), which are nonetheless integral to his con- ception, sums up the tower's actual semiotic status at that moment: In the Voisin scheme the distance between the past and the present is produced by replacing the urban fabric with a park. Through this erasure, Paris' past was to be simultaneously saved and destroyed. Although materially the same, the con- served buildings had a fundamentally different significance. For they now represented themselves as monuments.67 In the case of the Tour Saint-Jacques, this effect of museifi- cation had of course been unwittingly prepared over a cen- tury earlier by the government's fateful decision, absent any positive urban program, to forsake the Eglise Saint-Jacques and spare the tower, on its emptied plot. Surreal Readings: Brassai, Breton, and the Twentieth-Century Tour Intrigued, as Le Corbusier seems to have been, by the twen- tieth-century version of the Tour Saint-Jacques, and by the results of its sequential rescues, several surrealists pondered its plight in a 1933 publication. Still a source of debate at that late date, the tower was included on a list of Parisian landmarks under the heading: "Should we conserve, move, modify, transform, or demolish?"68 Andre Breton recom- mended emphasizing the tower's physical and psychological isolation by further demolitions in the area: "Conserve it as it is, but demolish the entire surrounding neighborhood and forbid anyone from coming within a kilometer for 100 years, under pain of death."69 Georges Wenstein's sugges- tion, "demolish the surrounding buildings" made the same point. Maurice Henry's proposal, to reerect it in the Place de la Concorde in place of the obelisk, recognized the same decisive drift in meaning and purpose.70 But it was Tristan Tzara's absurd proposal that really dramatized a perceived evacuation of the tower's capacity to signify: "Demolish it and rebuild it in rubber," he proposed. As a further perverse reminder of the tower's diminished significance, he pro- posed posing an empty shell on the roof of the tower, reminding us that it was once a sacred point of departure for pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostella.71 The surrealists' take on the Tour Saint-Jacques focused on the incongruity of its physical bulk with the scale of its sur- 468 JSAH / 60:4, DECEMBER 2001 -p</page><page sequence="20">roundings, and the incompatibility of its medieval messages with the signs of modern life. A photograph of the tower under scaffolding, taken by Brassai, was used by Andre Breton in his 1937 novel L'amourfou to illustrate his nocturnal wan- derings in forsaken quarters of Paris (Figure 24). The tower's lumbering and eerie presence reminds him of a sunflower, which he demonstrates by juxtaposition with a Man Ray close- up of the flower. "I was near you again, my beautiful wanderer, and you showed me, in passing, the Tour Saint-Jacques under its pale scaffolding, rendering it for some time now the world's great monument to the hidden. You know how I loved that tower: yet I see now again a whole violent existence forming around it to include us, to contain wildness itself in its gallop of clouds about us."72 He follows with the opening lines of an earlier poem entitled "Vigilance": In Paris the Tour Saint-Jacques swaying Like a sunflower Sometimes bumps its forehead against the Seine and its Shadow glides imperceptibly among the tugboats ... 73 Echoing the fixation of others on the tower's strandedness, and using the floral metaphor to add a melancholic theme of forsakenness or abandonment, he goes on to explain the fili- ation between the two tall figures, the sunflower capturing "the complex conception I form of the tower, of its somber magnificence, like that of the flower rising like it, quite alone upon a more or less impoverished corner of the earth .. ."74 Breton writes of the "wonderful dizziness these places inspire in me." Brassai records a similar sense of enchant- ment in his own account of photographic forays into the Paris night, seizing upon the Tour Saint-Jacques as an instance of the "marvelous," that combination of entice- ment and danger evoked by things out of place, loomingly sinister and strangely beautiful. He took the photograph with which we began (see Figure 1) and with which we con- clude, in 1932, having bribed the portly concierge of Notre Dame to allow him access to the rooftops in the middle of the night. Brassai's dark reverie may stand to summarize the semiotic trajectory followed by the Tour Saint-Jacques, and the successive deaths that continued to give it life in its migration from Gothic carillon to surrealist fantasy: We climbed the spiral staircase. It was totally dark; the climb lasted an eternity. At last, we reached the open platform. Com- pletely out of breath, my accomplice collapsed into her chair. Impatient, enraptured, I ran beside the balustrade. It was more beautiful than I had imagined! The dark, indefinable shapes were black as night, the fog over Paris was milk white!

"It's marvelous, marvelous," I kept exclaiming to myself ... But I had to get to the very top ... So up I climbed, still in complete darkness. I mounted the 378 steps. Coming out at the top, I saw behind the cathedral's spire the Seine glittering like a curved sword. Suddenly my foot brushed against something soft. I bent down, and beneath my fingers, numb from the cold of that November night, I felt the feathers of a dead pigeon. A dead pigeon, still warm . ..75 Architecture's Unstable Past We began with a speculation about the actual symbolic flex- ibility of an apparently rigid heritage. Applying the frame- work of a "perceptual history," we chronicled the semantic AFTERLIVES OF THE TOUR SAINT-JACQUES 469</page><page sequence="21">instability of an emblematic monument: the Tour Saint- Jacques was taken as typical in that its symbolic content changed over time, and as extraordinary in the document- edness and legibility of those changes. At one level, this mutability supports a poststructuralist reserve about the search for truth or fixity in the interpretation of cultural artifacts. As Barthes expressed it, in an important refine- ment of his own and others' earlier theoretical work, "today semiology never supposes the existence of a definitive sig- nified,"76 or, to quote more fully a passage cited above, "the signifieds are like mythical creatures, extremely impre- cise . . . the signifieds are transient, the signifiers remain. The hunt for the signified can thus constitute only a provi- sional approach."77 But if this discovery about slippage between form and content points toward the futility of a hunt for truth, it leaves available the path of an asymptotic understanding, provisional and contingent, approaching but never reaching completeness or finality. In the context of the urban environment, Barthes argues for a consequent open-endedness in the analysis of city fabrics. One could, by metonymic substitution, read the Tour Saint-Jacques into his Argo metaphor for the city as a whole: We construct, we make every city a little in the image of the ship Argo, whose every piece was no longer the original piece but which still remained the ship Argo, that is, a set of significations easily readable and recognizable. In this attempt at a semantic approach to the city we should try to understand the play of signs, to understand that any city is a structure, but that we must never try and we must never want to fill in this structure.78 Declining to propose specific "discovery procedures" for this open-ended line of inquiry that he terms "urban semi- ology," Barthes proposes the lens of reception, urging the investigator toward "a multiplicity of readings" of the city, overlaid and intercrossed, and then "unfolded" to bring out the rich polyvalence of its complex web of signifiers: "For the city is a poem ... it is a poem which unfolds the signi- fier and it is this unfolding that ultimately the semiology of the city should try to grasp and make sing."79 It is this poly- valent "multiplicity" that our reception history has sought to bring forth. In the case of the Tour Saint-Jacques, the approach of reception might seem to lay bare an ultimate lack, an empty space where meaning once resided. One could be tempted to conclude that, like the Eiffel Tower in Barthes influential essay, "the Tower is nothing, it achieves a kind of zero degree of the monument."80 But whereas the Eiffel Tower's "basic uselessness" ends up, in Barthes's analysis, covering for an ultimate "major symbolic function" or "final meaning" (the gaze that "deciphers Paris"),81 the Tour Saint-Jacques can lay no such culminating claim. More like the Statue of Lib- erty, as recently analyzed by Boime and others,82 its mean- ings have simply shifted and accumulated over time, achieving a distorting distance from the intentions of its builders. But this more prosaic semantic situation renders it no less vital, in terms of its urban role in contemporary Paris. In fact, the tower's turbulent perceptual life course has redemptive implications for other patrimonial assets.83 In a distinctly positive light, and with reference to Le Cor- busier's ambivalent attachment to the architecture of the past, the Tour Saint-Jacques offers compelling evidence of the availability of symbolic redefinition as a viable and even necessary option for historic architectures in the face of mounting economic and technological pressures in our inherited city centers. The tower's ability to "attract mean- ings like a lightning rod"84 spared it time after time, to the effect that it would now appear inviolate, embraced as a trace of an unrecoverable past, a "contact zone"85 between contemporary Parisians and their forebears. Brassai evoked the capacity of sidewalks and pavements and street corners to connect us with our ancestors; the Tour Saint-Jacques retains that awesome power, despite the traumas of its semantic journey. Notes This paper draws upon dissertation research that was initially expanded upon for a 1997 exhibition on the history of the Chatelet quarter in Paris, sponsored by the Delegation a l'action artistique de la ville de Paris. Its arguments were further developed and extended in papers delivered at Cor- nell University for the Department of Romance Studies' "After-Images of the City" conference in 1998, and the College of Art, Architecture and Planning's History of Architecture Lecture Series in 2000.

The earliest mention of such a category ("les monumens et edifices qui meritent d'etre conserves tels que le Pantheon francais et autres de meme genre") is in A.N. F13 325A, "Classement des Batimens Civils par ordre de Division pour le Departement de la Seine." The document is undated, but corresponds to the first organization of the Conseil, formulated in the early months of 1796, following its establishment in December 1795 (frimaire an IV). For the longer history of architectural preservation efforts in the revolutionary era, see Lauren M.

Survey of 1 August 1796 (14 thermidor IV), sponsored by Minister of the Interior Benezech. This Directorial effort, too, presaged later, better-known ones, such as the 1810 survey of abbeys and chateaus conducted by Napoleon's Minister of the Interior Montalivet, which yielded Alexandre Laborde's spectacular Les Monuments de la France classes chronologiquement (1818). A survey similar to that of 1796 was conducted in 1794 by the Com- mission des Travaux Publics, revolutionary predecessor to the Conseil des Batiments Civils, which assumed custody of formerly royal buildings soon after the Bitiments du Roi was dissolved (A.N. F13 335A and B). 16. A.N. F21* 2473, 21 April 1799 (2 floreal). (". . . que grand nombre de ces Edifices, l'admiration des Artistes et des Etrangers ont ete detruits, que d'autres ont ete alienes ou soumissiones, et le reste abandonne a des locataires destructeurs qui alterent plus ces monumens que ne feroient les ravages des Enemis ou de longues annees.")

In Riegl's vocabulary, "monument" denotes a living symbol of shared values, an intentional creation calling to mind beliefs still held by contem- poraries, and "historic monument" is defined as a neutral document of past events, accomplishments, or beliefs; Der moderne Denkmalkultus (1903).

I am very grateful to Francoise Boudon, director of the Conseil archive digitization project, for calling this document to my attention. In assigning greater value to the seventeenth- century Jesuit church than to the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Conseil antici- pated its own aesthetic shift away from the medieval structures it championed in the wake of the Revolution, and toward the classicism that would inspire the majority of the projects it supervised in the nineteenth century. See, for example, George Teyssot, "Planning and Building in Towns: The System of the Batiments Civils in France, 1795-1848," in Robin Middleton, ed., The Beaux-Arts and Nineteenth-Century French Archi- tecture (Cambridge, 1982), 34-49. 26.

The tantalizing gap in Barthes's analysis-his refusal to "discuss the discovery procedures of urban semiology" (168)-points to a next, "scientific," step: "It is probable that these procedures would consist in decomposing the urban text into units, then distributing these units in formal classes and, thirdly, finding the rules of combination and transformation of these units and mod- els." We would tend not to pursue the language metaphor so vigorously, in the conviction that the search for "micro-structures" (170) would threaten to undermine the semantic richness of the more open-ended inquiry his essay broadly advises. Barthes implies as much in his own demurral. 80. Roland Barthes, "The Eiffel Tower," Rethinking Architecture, 174. 81. Ibid., 174-176, 178. "The Tower is merely the witness, the gaze which discreetly fixes, with its slender signal, the whole structure-geographical, historical, and social-of Paris space." 82.

Despite the challenge of locating typologically parallel examples. Other monumental sculptural accents on the Parisian landscape-the obelisk at the Place de la Concorde, for example, or the triumphal column at Place Vend6me-exemplify the same vulnerability to the fortunes of public per- ception (see, for example, Matt K. Matsuda's discussion of the symbolic and physical vicissitudes of the Vend6me column in the nineteenth century, "Monuments: Idols of the Emperor, in The Memory of the Modern [New York, 1996], 19-39). But their stories are not, fundamentally, "like" that of the Tour Saint-Jacques; from the moment it was deprived of its raison d'etre as the bell tower of a parish church, its sudden functionlessness made it both unlike other "intentional monuments" and uniquely suited for a particular type of architectural analysis, one trained on meaning. While the Tour Saint-Jacques is atypical in formal, functional, and typological terms, many structures-whether urban fragments, sculptural monuments or "buildings" proper-will have experienced analogous semantic shifts, and might prof- itably be read and understood through the lens we describe. 84. Barthes, "The Eiffel Tower," 173. 85. I borrow the term from Mary Louise Pratt's Imperial Eyes: Travel Writ- ing and Transculturation (London, 1992), where it is used in the context of spaces of cross-cultural encounter, where travelers in foreign lands come into contact with their "others."
