One wonders whether the western object of veneration and worship in the Near East Asiatic goddess associated with the tree may have from the end of the fourth millennium BCE until been the catalyst to the appearance of the Egypt this very day.

For the various manifestations of the Egyptian tree god dess see Goldwasser 1995: 120-126. A unique 7th cen tury bronze shield from Miletus shows a stylized tree with teat-like appendages suckling a pair of bull calves. In the tondon a lion bites the neck of a bull (Kleiner 1967: 18). Possibly this extraordinary representation echoes the idea of the Egyptian nursing Tree Goddess combined with the suckling cow motif, known from rock art as early as Pre-Dynastic Egypt (Wadi Umm Salam in the Eastern Desert, see Wilkinson 2003:109), which became the hieroglyph imi signifying motherly love and compassion as well as rejoicing (Erman and Grapow, Wörterbuch I: 11; Keel 1980: 82, Compare Arabic r'm „to love tenderly, to treat tenderly" (mother towards children, said also of cattle), see Wellhausen 1897: 163.1 am indebted to Professor Günter Kopeke of New York University, Institute of Fine Arts, for calling my attention to this work of art. To the best of my knowledge the goddesses depicted on an Akkadian El cylinder seal from Mari of the 24th-23rd century BCE cannot be classified as tree goddesses, as postulated by Keel 1998: 21 and fig. 7. The two god desses flank a god seated on a scaled mountain, their feet submerged in streams spewed from animals' heads whose necks emanate from the sides of the mountain. The leafy branches that grow from the goddesses' shoulders and body are depicted in the characteristic convention of representing gods with their attributes in Akkadian art, where the attributes emanate from the gods' bodies, particularly the shoulders. P. Amiet (1960: 219) interpreted these goddesses as manifestations of the reunion of water and the powers of fertility. These goddesses, who cannot be identified in Mesopotamian texts, are reminiscent of the Old Hittite depictions of a goddess holding a cup sitting under a tree, her feet in a stream of water on Middle Bronze Age seals from Acemhöyük in central Anatolia, see Mellink 1992: 197-198. Indeed, in Hittite texts that describe deities of springs and streams, these deities are depicted as females - women or young girls, holding a cup (GÜTER BOCK 1983: 205, 211). They should perhaps be under stood as loci goddesses, signifying a mountainous loca tion where a spring gushed forth, that watered a leafy tree. Such 'holy places', erected on heights near old spreading trees are termed in the Bible as 'aseñm, not to be confused with 'aseräh, the cult idol, whatever its form (Lipinski 1986: 93-94).

This replacement of tree by the pubic triangle conveys the idea that both elements - the tree and the woman - were con ceived as nurturing beings, and strengthens the supposition that the tree was perceived as a mani festation of the goddess, and that goddess and tree were interchangeable. The Tell al-Yahudiyeh rhyton-juglet with a female head from Jericho embodies the same concept (Fig. 3).11 The juglet has two openings - one, placed in her braided hair, through which the vessel was filled, while the other, placed in her mouth, served for pouring.

Flanking the tree are: on the left a horned animal and a fish behind; on the right of the trunk a human figure and a long-legged bird (ostrich?) are shown. The vase probably is a concrete example of the nur turing woman-tree: when in use the liquid would flow from the mouth, watering the tree. The well watered life-giving tree nourishes humankind and animals alike. A group of pear-shaped (some with an accen tuated head) sheet-gold or electrum pendants from the end of the Middle Bronze Age and the beginning of the Late Bronze Age clearly demon strates the connection between goddess and tree (Fig. 4). These piriform pendants, found mainly at Minet el-Beida, Ugarit and Tell el-'Ajjul, feature a female figure reduced to head with Hathor wig and body, with breasts and navel crudely sketched, whereas the pubic triangle is emphati cally rendered. A branch grows from the pubic tri angle or from the navel. The branch is not easily distinguished, it may represent the tree as a whole, an offshoot or a frond. Thus both the female and the tree are represented by parts that stand for the whole. The Syrian-Palestinian pen dants have been associated with an Old Assyrian silver pudendum dedicated to Ishtar by a woman.

Metzger 1983 in his caption to fig. 17a interprets the date gathering as a ritual harvest of dates. If indeed date gathering pre ceded or accompanied the investiture of the king at Mari, it may be concluded that the ceremony took place in September-October, the time of the date harvest and the autumnal equinox. The re-establishment of a king's rule was celebrated on the New Year, which, according to ARAÍI 50: 5-20 (Yasmah-Addu) at Mari took place in the 12 month, Addar, that is at the spring equinox (Falken stein 1959: 157; Dalley 1984: 135). Nonetheless, accord ing to Syrian tradition, for example at third millennium Ebla, the New year coincided with the autumnal equi nox; or it may have been celebrated twice a year, as at Ur (see Black 1981: 41), and later in Seleucid Uruk (Cohen 1993: 427). The Mari letter would exclude that the date harvest actually preceded the investiture. This would mean that the goddess' identification with the tree gains double importance: although the re-investiture of the king took place in the spring, the tree is shown carrying an abundance of fruit, as befits the goddess who was per ceived as the numen in the date palm. According to Mesopotamian tradition, the king's rule was re-estab lished through rituals of divine love (Nissinen 2001: 128), see discussion of the date-palm as a metaphor for the bride on the Song of Songs, below. Winter 2003: 253* (see, however, York 1975: 274, who suggests an Egyptian papyrus umbel prototype for the "flowering tree" of the Mari investiture scene). These stylized trees have been dubbed "Tree of Life" or "Sacred Tree", though these names are unknown in cuneiform texts. See Watanabe 1994: 580. Ishtar's function as bestower of kingship and protectress of her city may have contributed to her bellicose charac ter, since according to Sumerian tradition, kingship fol lowed the fortune of arms. See Westenholz 2002: 19. This association between Ishtar and kingship is also evi dent in the facade of the throne room of the southern palace of Babylon. The facade was decorated with col ored glazed bricks including a lower frieze of striding lions, above which is a representation of palm columns with volute capitals. The whole field has rosette borders. Lions, palms and rosettes are all emblematic of the god dess Ishtar.

Barrelet.37 The linear lay out of the painting orders the eye to follow the trail from the trees towards the goddesses with flowing vases into the innermost hall, where the ceremony of investing the king took place. M.-Th. Barrelet proposed that the painting reproduced the reality of the place where the investiture actually was enacted, and suggested it was the Ishtar temple.38 A. Parrot maintained that the mural was a faithful copy of court 106, where it had been found in situ, with the adjacent audience hall 64, where the foun tain statue of the goddess with flowing vase was placed, undoubtedly one of a pair, according to Mesopotamian law of symmetry,39 and the inner most hall 65, where the investiture ceremony took place.40 Margueron further demonstrated that when two diagonals are drawn from the corners of the painting they intersect on Ishtar's chin, indi cating that she is the heart of the entire composi tion, and parallels the date palm, at the core of the Court of the Palm (Fig. 10). It seems that the painter designed the whole composition according to the focal point of the event - the goddess Ishtar meeting the king - and from there subtly devel oped his compositional scheme on several planes in a most intellectually inventive spirit that accord ed with the symbolism of the event. Margueron's reconstruction allows for the identification of the goddess Ishtar in the painting with the date palm, the life-giving tree and the focal point of the palace, after which the court had been named. The duplication of the actual date palm flanking the panel served a decorative purpose that accord ed with the tripartite scheme of the composition.41 The stylized trees and fantastic creatures represent Barrelet 1968: 209. Barrelet 1950. Note also that the frame of the whole panel is made of a guilloche band, representing water, see Alexander 1991: 180-181. Parrot 1950.

The lion is looking back at a palm tree that stands behind the goddess. Crossed rampant ibexes fol low behind the tree.46 Ishtar and the tree stand as apposition for each other. This Neo-Assyrian seal features in A. Livingstone's Court Poetry and Literary Miscellanea (SAA 3) as an illustration (fig. 4) to Assurbanipal's hymn to Ishtar of Nineveh. The opening line reads: "O palm tree, daughter of Nin eveh, stag of the lands!".47 The caption to the illus tration reads: "Ishtar, standing on a panther, flanked by a palm tree and ibexes symbolizing her lover Tammuz".48 The palm tree is also an epithet of Ishtar of Babylon, who is addressed as mother, For fantastic creatures guarding the stylized tree com pare the Cherubs guarding the Tree of Life in Genesis 3:24. 43 Barrelet 1950: 25. 44 Winter 2003: 254*. 45 Collon 1987: no. 773. 4I&gt; For crossed ibexes near a date palm, see Middle Assyr ian cylinder seal Moortgat VAR 587 (Matthews 1990: no. 302), where the pair of crossed ibexes comprises a male and a female suckling its young. 47 Livingstone 1989: 18-20. 48 Note that Collon 2001: 128 identifies the palm tree as the topos symbol of Babylonia.</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 12 Seal of Zagganita, after Keel 1992b: fig. 86a "a palm of carnelian, most beautiful of the beauti ful ones".49 Both passages establish beyond ques tion that Ishtar was associated with the date palm. S. Parpóla contends that in Assyrian iconography Ishtar as the date palm was represented by the trunk of the stylized sacred tree. He believes that the Assyrian sacred tree evolved into the Kabbalis tic Tree of Life, where the trunk - Tif eret, equals Ishtar as beauty.50 The association of the warrior goddess with the tree dates back to the third millennium BCE, as exemplified by two Akkadian cylinder seals. That of Zagganita the scribe in the Louvre (Fig. 12) shows the winged and armed goddess triumphant ly climbing a mountain next to which grows a date palm.51 Two gods advance towards the tree, their hands raised in blessing, indicating that the tree, embodying Ishtar's aspect of abundance, is per ceived as the focus of veneration. On the other seal the goddess, approached by two devotees, is seated on a lions flanked throne. Two figures har vest fruit from the date palm growing behind the devotees.52 The surroundings have been interpret ed as the goddesses' temple garden.53 The very same symbolism, which includes god dess, palm tree and caprids, and lions features on the 10th century cult stand from Ta'anakh found by Lapp (Fig. 13).

The biblical goddess represented as a tree was Asherah. Asherah is the female counterpart or spouse of the male god, and is envisioned as a tree, though the scripture does not say what kind tree it is. In Deuteronomy 16:21 Asherah is planted. In Deuteronomy 7:5 it is felled and in Judges 6: 26-29 the Asherah that stands by the altar of Baal is cut down, its wood used as fuel for the burnt Fig. 14 Painting on Pithos A, Kuntillet'Ajrud, offering.

In the 'Ajrud drawing the eliminated anthropomorphic goddess could be a naked goddess standing on the back of a lion, as known from Late Bronze Age representations on two gold plaques from Minet el-Beida (Negbi 19V6: 99-100, nos. 1700-1701, pis. 53-54), on a bronze pendant from Akko (Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977) and on the clay plaque from Tel Harasim (GrvON 2002: 26*, figs. 2:1, 3:1); or a warrior goddess, as on the two Iron Age pen dants - one from Tel Miqne, the other from Tel Dan - warrior goddess on a bull (Biran 1999). The Iron Age pendants with the warrior goddess exemplify Assyrian impact on Philistia (Gitin 1997: 92-93).

At Yavneh, bull heads were pegged into small round holes prior to firing. The necks were pulled through these sockets; once pegged, the surface was smoothed so that the holes could not be seen anymore. So far unknown in Palestine, this technical detail is reminiscent of the Cypri ot potter's tradition of handles attached by use of a tenon pushed through the body of a vessel from the Early Bronze Age through the Late Bronze Age also employed for attachment of legs in Base Ring bull statuettes. Hittite Anatolia saw a proliferation of divine represen tations of one and the same deity, who could also be manifested in various forms: human or animal shaped, as well as taking the forms of an object or a stone mon ument (Collins 2005: 23-29). Kletter 1996: 76. Jaros has suggested that the adoration of the tree may be traced visually in Late Bronze through Iron Age II seals from Palestine and the Phoenician coast configurating a central tree flanked by human fig ures with raised arms (Jaros 1980: 210-211).

On the way from Mecca to al-Ta'if was an idol of al-'Uzza which was specially venerated by Quraysh and Banu Kinana. Three Samu ra trees were associated with the deity. After the con quest of Mecca Muhammad ordered Khalid b. al-Walid to cut down the trees and destroyed the idol (Mont GOMERY-Watt 1993: 924). The palm tree was associated with a goddess. The Prophet was associated with the "olive tree" or the "tree of Muhammad", which may be interpreted as the sidrat al-muntaha "the tree of utmost bounds" or the tree of light, whose roots are in Par adise and whose crest in the realm of God (Sura 53:16), see Milstein 1999: 35-39.</page><page sequence="14">424 Irit Ziffer :')/Ö/0™/0) íQ /Oi/CI/Q)^ mmsmmmsf^' Fig. 17 Lintel of the portal of a temple at Hatam, showing goddesses flanking a date-palm, on the branches of which birds (doves?) are perched, and rows of ibexes, c. mid-first millennium BCE, after Hoyland 2001: 168 fig. 4 19:24-26, which states that the Virgin retires alone whose water had an exceedingly sweet odour.

OT feminist scholarship has tended to ascribe Deborah's military role to Canaanite or Mesopotamian prototypes of the bellicose goddess - Anat and Ishtar respectively (Acker man 2003: 177 and there previous literature; Frymer Kensky 2002: 46, 50).
