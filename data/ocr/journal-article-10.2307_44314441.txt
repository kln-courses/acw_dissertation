<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol 54 , No. 3 (Spring 2005) Reconsidering Levels of Meaning Northrop Frye Prefatory Note The present essay, which centers on Northrop Frye's interest in the Bible, derives from two lectures he gave in 1979, only a few years before his first book on the Bible, The Great Code: The Bible and Literature was published (1982). Frye's interest in the Bible can be traced to his childhood: his mother taught him Bible stories at an early age, even introducing him to Josephus, and as a child he read Hurlbuťs Story of the Bible (1904), a well- traveled retelling of 168 Biblical stories which is still in print. But The Great Code derived ultimately from the course on the English Bible that Frye taught for some forty years before the book was published. Even before he began teaching "The English Bible" in the mid- 1940s, he had led an informal discussion for a small group of students, sponsored by the Student Christian Movement, on Biblical symbolism and typology. In the Preface to The Great Code Frye remarked, "The book (with its successor) has been on my mind for a long time" (ix), and indeed his intention to write on the Bible can be traced to entries in his earliest notebooks. As we learn from a 1939 notebook, as yet unpublished, a study of the literary symbolism of the Bible was part of the plan Frye sketched for his first book, antedating even Fearful Symmetry. His intention to write a book on the Bible goes back, then, almost four-and-a-half decades before The Great Code finally appeared. Anatomy of Criticism contained a sketch of a typological study of the Bible in the context of epic forms, and following the completion of Anatomy, Frye considered writing a book on the epic, its three parts being devoted to Homer and Virgil, the Bible, and Dante. The plans for the book that was to succeed the Anatomy - what Frye called his "third book" - went through numerous and complicated outlines: sometimes he speaks of a separate book and at other times of a section or chapter of the "third book." 397</page><page sequence="2">398 Northrop Frye Frye was never able to write this third book in the grand continuous form he had outlined, but parts of the design did split off into smaller projects. One of these was the 1971 Birks Lectures at McGill University, a project he began planning in 1969. But sometime after April 1971 he began to see the book on religion that would issue from the Birks lectures as merging with his handbook on Biblical symbolism. He contemplated doing "a small book on the literary uses of the Bible," but eventually decided he really was going to write a "big book on the Bible," the Birks lectures book being now displaced by a seven-section book, the thirty-two chapters of which he outlined in some detail. This plan, as was typical of Frye's major writing projects, went through numerous other schematic formulations during the next ten years, and in the present lectures these are distilled into two broad topics - language and meaning. The first lecture is an embryonic form of the theory of language that Frye developed in the opening chapter of The Great Code and to which he returned in the first chapter of his second book on the Bible, Words with Power (1990). The second lecture focuses on the theory of "levels of meaning" in Frye's title- a reconsideration of Dante's theory of polysemous meaning that formed the backbone of the theory of symbols in Anatomy of Criticism. Frye turns to Dante's ladder of meaning in the final chapter of The Great Code , and he turns to it again, eight years later, in the opening chapter of Words with Power. The present lectures, then, represent a fairly late, succinct, and informal account of Frye's thinking on the language of the Bible and its levels of meaning. The two lectures were given on successive evenings at Emory &amp; Henry College, Emory, Virginia, 15-16 March 1979. Frye spoke, not from a manuscript, but from a set of notes he had jotted down on two sheets of paper. In transcribing the lectures from an audio-recording, I have altered Frye's "radical of presentation" from an oral form into a written one, imitating the process of much biblical transmission itself and so preserving what would otherwise be unknown or forgotten. Robert D. Denham I I have been interested for some time now in writing a book on the Bible within the orbit of literary criticism. As a literary critic, I have been</page><page sequence="3">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 399 revolving around the Bible all my life. When I started out as a junior instructor teaching Milton and writing a book about Blake, both of whom are unusually Biblical even by the standards of English literature, I complained to the chairman of my department about my difficulties of communicating with my students about Paradise Lost He said the only solution to that was to offer a course in the English Bible, because it was no good trying to teach Paradise Lost to students who didn't know a Philistine from a Pharisee. So I undertook to teach this course for many reasons besides my own concerns. A student of English literature who doesn't know the Bible doesn't know what is going on in English literature. The knowledge that he has is bound to be full of misconstruings and false assumptions. However, my interest is mainly in secular literature, and it was a long time before I realized I had to come to closer grips with the Bible. I'm not a Biblical scholar: that's an area of extensively cultivated scholarship where the word "amateur" would be much too flattering for anything that I was. But it occurred to me that if I were to deal with the Bible within the context of literary criticism, I should have to answer the question, what language has the Bible been written in? Now in French there is a very useful distinction between a langue and a langage. If you ask, what langue the Bible has been written in, the answers are factual: Hebrew and Greek. But that didn't seem to mean very much for a book that has made most of its cultural influence through Latin and vernacular translations. The question of langage opened up the question of the history of language. It took me a very long time to formulate the problem in those terms, because it had not occurred to me that there was such a thing as the history of language. So I looked at the first person to think seriously about this and other matters, the eighteenth-century Italian philosopher, Vico. Vico says he's of no use on the Bible: he just bracketed that out - eliminated it from his purview of the cycle. According to this view, there's an age of gods, an age of heroes, and an age of the people. After history runs through that cycle, it starts all over again. There is an age of gods in Homer, an age of heroes emerging out of that (the heroic aristocracy of Greece), and an age of the people from Euripides on to Roman times. Then there's a ricorso , as he calls it, a cyclical return, and you start the whole process over again in the Middle Ages. In Vicos day, of course, there had been no permanently successful example of a democracy, so he assumed that the age of the people could do nothing except disintegrate and go around the circle again. He also said</page><page sequence="4">400 Northrop Frye that there was a language for each stage of this cycle. He described these languages in Egyptian terms as hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic, that is, a mythical language which is essentially poetic in its nature, an allegorical language for the age of heroes, and a descriptive language for the age of the people. Vico thought of all these stages as essentially forms of writing, because he had the view that people communicated with signs before they could talk. I don't think we need that version of it, but this notion of three stages of language might, I thought, give us a context for looking at the Bible. It seems to me that there are différent phases in the evolution of language in general. If you look back, say, to the religions preceding the Bible and still practiced outside it, there is an approach to language that seems to be peculiar to that age. Different kinds of language, I suppose, will co-exist in all periods. I should think that an Egyptian or a Sumerian of 5000 B.C., if he were ordering stone for a building or dickering with his in-laws about the price of his bride or assessing the tax a farmer owed, would use the same linguistic categories of truth and falsehood and of the reasonable and the fantastic that we use now. But I'm speaking of the language of cultural ascendancy, and it seems to me that in the first stage there is a conception of language which sees it as essentially a power reaching out to nature, a form of language in which the word evokes the image. The image is conceived as identical with the word but brought into existence through the word. The religions of early times were founded on the conception of the gods, and a god is in the first place a metaphor. A metaphor is a statement of identity (this is that), and a god is a sun-god or a tree-god or a war-god, which is essentially a personified force and an object in nature being identified. That identification is the kernel of what we call metaphor. That means, among other things, that the name of the god is a matter of immense importance, and a great deal of magic comes into the use of language on this level and in this phase. That is, a word is a word of power. If you know a god's name, or later on a devil's name, you can make him do certain things. Warriors will go into their battles with boasts, because the boast is a way of acquiring a word of power. In the same way, as you remember from Greek mythology, the gods take a very dim view of human boasts. If you start boasting, you're certain to get it in the neck from the gods, because, again, you are acquiring what might be a word of power, what might be something to control them. So there's a latent magic in the use of the word, and the culturally ascendant use of this brings that out very clearly. In Babylon on New Year's Day, the epic of the creation of the world was recited. That was</page><page sequence="5">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 401 one of the innumerable ritual acts in which the recitation of the right words, the sacred words, the words of power, was a way of sustaining the course of nature. It was a way of making sure that the cycle went around for another year, when it was time to recite the epic again. The sense in which the word is the active principle that has a force binding the order of nature is the primitive basis, I think, of all language. That is true, certainly, of poetic language, and the particular kind of prose that arises in early times is a very distinctive prose, not at all what we think of now as prose. That is, in Greek philosophy before Plato the pre-Socratic philosophers, as Aristotle calls them, are not really so much philosophers as they are gurus. They are spiritual guides, and what they say is in the form of detached aphorism. You dont argue with these aphorisms. You simply ponder them, brood over them, and acquire them, take personal possession of them, because such aphorisms as "All things flow" and "You travel most safely by the middle of the road" are words of power. These are things that are not locked in a chain of words: they are to be taken in singly, one by one. That is the kind of prose that you find in the Bible. If you look at a King James Bible, you find that every sentence has been printed as a separate paragraph. Thats done mainly for the convenience of preachers, but it also brings out a certain rhythm in the Bible which is by no means confined to the poetic sections. You find that everywhere you look the prose keeps breaking down into hard little discontinuous kernels. In the legal sections, the commandment is a little statement by itself. You take that in, and it becomes a word of power for you. The wisdom literature in Ecclesiastes and Proverbs is focused on the proverb or aphorism. And the prophetic literature is focused on the oracle. The same thing is true even of the New Testament which is, considering its date, remarkably conservative in its adherence to this kind of discontinuous prose of authority. That is a phase of the use of language in which the word is not a real thing but it is a real force, and it unites with real things and in a sense brings them to life. Its hieroglyphic, as Vico says, not in the sense of sign writing necessarily, but in the sense of sign thinking. This conception of language from Plato on in Greek times begins to modulate into another conception of language where language seems to be thought of now in a different context. Words are now the expression of thoughts. Among figures of speech the most concrete, the most simple, the most definite is the metaphor where "this is that." Then you move into a rather more complex figure of speech called metonymy, which means "this is put for that" and consequently is to some degree less than that. That is,</page><page sequence="6">402 Northrop Frye when words are an expression of thought, they don't account for the entire reality of the thought. There is something in it of taking the part for the whole, which is one aspect of metonymy. The word "god" with a small "g" is a metaphor, because in "sun-god" and "tree-god" the god is identified with the sun and the tree. But the God with a capital "G," the God of Judaism or Christianity is a metonymy because nothing so finite as a name can possibly express an infinite being. The sense of the residual magic in words is transferred to the sense of the continuity of language, because it is in this phase of words that continuous prose, what we think of as ordinary prose, begins to be developed. In place of the old gurus saying, "All things flow" or "Don't eat beans" you get Socrates saying, "I don't know anything but I'm looking for something. Come and help me look." As they come and help him look, they follow along a track of argument, of ideas, of what Socrates calls dialectic. Words begin to take on now a certain continuity, and that continuity has a magic all its own. This is the phase of words permeated by a strong belief in logic, in the syllogism, in the fact that words are magically interconnected with other words. Descartes begins his philosophy by saying, "I think; therefore I am." The operative word, as you will notice, is "therefore." What he really believes in is the connectability of words. Earlier there had been the medieval proof of the existence of God, which really boils down to saying, "I think; therefore God exists." Again, it's the "therefore" that is really believed in. It's the time when people could accept doctrines, like the predestination of some people to Hell before they were born. When you ask why people would believe such remarkably repulsive and irrational doctrine, the answer is always again in the connection of words with one another. If you accept this, then you must accept that. That is a stage in language where there is a sense of a linear event, as in St. Thomas, where you start with the elements of faith in Christianity and use those as major premises. Then you deduce philosophy from faith and science from philosophy. Actually they never completed that structure because it can't be completed. It's another kind of Tower of Babel, but the belief in it was very intense for a long time. So the central doctrine of the Bible at the beginning of the Gospel of John, "In the beginning was the Word," naturally takes on a different connotation. In the Renaissance we have Erasmus editing the Greek New Testament, translating this verse into Latin as in principio erat sermo, "In the beginning was the discourse;" the interconnection of ideas out of which words grow. Now this phase, although it is traditionally Christian, is of course post-Biblical. We don't get this use of language in the Bible itself. There are no discursive or</page><page sequence="7">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 403 rational arguments in the Bible. Those passages that look as though they were rational arguments, as in the Epistle to the Hebrews, always turn out to be disguised forms of preaching or exhortation. Most of the prose of the Bible is oratorical prose, and oratory is the aspect of prose that is closest to the metaphorical, magical approach to words, because the intention in oratory is to act on an audience and affect it by the power of words. This is also an approach to language which goes with certain social developments. Language is entrusted to an elite of learned men, at least to philosophers, and doctrines are rationalized. Many of the central Biblical conceptions which became elements in Christian doctrine are statable only in the form of metaphor or "this is that": such doctrines as Christ is God and man; in the Trinity, one is three and three are one; in the doctrine of the real presence, the blood and the body are the wine and the bread. These are all metaphorical in their statement. In the next phase of language they become rationalized by conceptions, like a substance. Reconciliation is in fact one of the great activities of this approach to language, because this is the period of language in which continuous prose is developed. The general principle of reconciling doctrines, as you get it in immense volumes of commentary that are turned out in this period, is that if you only write enough sentences, any statement whatever can be reconciled with any other statement whatever. The general process of rationalizing works itself out everywhere. In his Summa contra Gentilesy for example, St. Thomas Aquinas has a chapter entitled "That God hates nothing." In a rational conception of God, of course, a perfect being cant hate anybody or anything. That's fair enough. Then he's confronted with the long list of things in the Bible that God is said to hate. Those can only be explained as analogy or as speaking in parable. The third part of Vicos cycle, the demotic part, is the sense of words as descriptive, which really reverses the original magical conception of words. In the original conception the word evokes the image, but in descriptive approaches to language the image evokes the word. This is a use of language which in English philosophy begins theoretically with Francis Bacon and more effectively with Locke. The sense is that man is a subject contemplating an objective world out there and that words are thought of as a servo-mechanism to interpret the reality which is out there for him. That is also the period - in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries - when literature becomes increasingly realistic and documentary and relies more and more on a description of an outer world.</page><page sequence="8">404 Northrop Frye There are many positive virtues in this approach to writing. The good demotic writer, the good writer working on a descriptive basis, sets out his argument as plainly and honestly as possible, and all the tricks of metaphor and metonymy and other figures of speech are avoided as far as possible because he considers them as merely verbal. In that clarity and honesty there is a great deal that makes us realize that this is in fact the approach to language that makes a democracy a working possibility. This approach to and treatment of language is a much more essential safeguard of our freedom than almost anything else one could mention. At the same time there is a limit to it. It is impossible for words to describe anything with complete accuracy, because they are always getting snarled up in their own grammatical fictions. That is, there are certain phenomena out there to be described, you put words to describe them, but in the words you get tangled up with subjects and predicates and objects, and you very soon find yourself operating a machine where a subject is chasing an object through a wilderness of predicates. That, of course, is a grammatical fiction, and words keep tying themselves up in their own grammatical fictions. There are only two things you can do. One is to assume that subjects and predicates and objects belong to the nature of reality, which is obviously nonsense. The other is to recognize the limitations of this use of language and allow for it accordingly. The metaphorical, magical use of language is still the primary use, and the descriptive use is still a secondary and derived use. I am emphasizing this because it is the function of literature in general, and poetry more particularly, in every age to recreate the original, primary, magical, and metaphorical use of language. If I can give you an example of what I mean, there is a fairly familiar hymn which contains the two lines, "His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form, / And dark is his path on the wings of the storm."1 If you were to take that literally, whatever literally means, you would say that it is about as crude a form anthropomorphic superstition that it is possible to have - that whenever you hear it thunder you look up in the sky and say there's God riding around in his private plane again. You could say, of course, that no sane person would ever take it that way, that we take it as poetic metaphor. Well, this hymn, like all other hymns, is based on Biblical language, and the Psalms were told that Jehovah rode upon a cherub and did fly [Psalm 18:10-14]. But the language in the Psalms is still the language of poetic metaphor. You would have to go back a long way in human society before you could get a society crude enough to believe that the voice of thunder actually meant the god riding around the sky, and perhaps you would never</page><page sequence="9">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 405 find such a society. I doubt very much that you would. What you would come to is a point at which there is some kind of authentic experience of reality which can only be expressed in this kind of language. If you can say that this language cannot be literally true and therefore cannot be true, its clear that you have to revise your notion of truth and the number of ways that truth can be rendered in words. That brings me back to my original fascination with the Bible. There is a great deal of talk now in critical circles about what happens when somebody reads a book that used to be a fairly simple text but now has become fantastically complicated and all the tired old philosophical problems with the theory of knowledge (is there really a text, or do you simply make it all up as you read it?) are coming back into the study of language and literary criticism. It seems to me that all of these problems really revolve around the conception of recreation. If you read a text you do to some extent recreate it in your own mind, and all texts have two poles. They have an objective pole of what is presumably meant to the author when he wrote it and to the people who were his contemporaries, and they have a more subjective pole of yourself, of what it means to you. Both of these poles are absolutely essential in all reading. If you eliminate what it meant to the writer himself in his own day and to his contemporaries, then you're simply kidnapping everything you read into your own cultural orbit and reading your own socially conditioned values into it. On the other hand, if you eliminate its relevance to you and concentrate entirely on what it may have meant in its own day, you turn literature into something hopelessly remote from yourself. The process itself contains the greatest possible mystery in the study of literature: why is it that somebody as remote in time and space and language and cultural assumptions from us as Homer or the writers of the Old Testament can still speak across all those barriers of time and space and hit us where we live. In that process there is bound to be a great deal of misunderstanding and misreading; to some extent we simply have to accept that as a part of the situation were involved in. If you look at the structure of the Bible, for example, you see how vividly it illustrates all these problems. You can t trace the Bible back to a time when it was not recreating itself. You have the writer of the Book of Kings, who is in turn using sources behind him that we've lost, and then you have the chronicler coming along and restating what he wrote and trying to iron out some of the difficulties that he finds in the text. The Book of Samuel says that God stirred up David to take a census, which was against the law, so that you would have an excuse to punish him, and the chronicler is bothered</page><page sequence="10">406 Northrop Frye by this theology so he says it was Satan who stirred up David [2 Samuel 24]. The writer of Samuel says that the Philistine giant Goliath was killed by El Hanan of Bethlehem, and the story was transferred to David so that the chronicler says that El Hanan killed the brother of Goliath [ 1 Chronicles 25; 1 Samuel 17:50; 2 Samuel 21:19]. This process had been going on, and in the middle of it all is the relationship between the Old and the New Testament, between Judaism and Christianity, which is, of course, from the point of view of Judaism a gigantic misunderstanding and misreading. That means that the process of recreation in connection with the Bible is moving forward in time as tradition builds up, so you get the process of evolving commentary and exegesis in which the meaning of the Bible is what a growing consensus of theologians, ecclesiastics, and others assume the meaning to be. That means that it gets so thickly wrapped up that nobody can possibly look into it except specialists. Within the process, of course, there is this growing force of what I've called rationalization. For example, if you begin the gospel of Matthew you read first of all that Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and so on down, the point being that Jesus through his father Joseph was descended from King David. Then chapter two begins with the birth of Jesus Christ, and we're told that Jesus was born from a virgin and that Joseph was not his father at all. A man from Mars would say, "It can't happen that he was both the son of Joseph and not the son of Joseph. Isn't there a difficulty here?" There is, of course, an entire library, a very thick library of commentary, which explains the solution to what the paradox is. As it would take a lifetime to read all of that, it is simpler to assume that the difficulty has somehow or other been taken care of. That is the part of tradition that keeps on piling up like a terminal moraine in front of a glacier, a growing body of commentary. Of course, the same thing happens in literature as you will soon see if you will turn from the study of Shakespeare's plays, which is very profitable, to the secondary sources of Shakespeare, which are exhausting. The forward movement in time, therefore, is one thing which goes on as time goes on, and then there is simultaneously a backward movement, what you might call a more archeological approach, which tries to look back as far as it can to what is behind the texts that we have, what is their origin and genesis, and out of what postulates and assumptions they come. That can also be carried to the opposite point, where the unwrapping process can go to a point where there is nothing left. We are often told, for example, that in the study of the gospels we should try to demythologize the gospels and</page><page sequence="11">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 407 try to work behind them to see what kind of human personality Jesus had. But the trouble is when you do that there's really nothing left of the gospels whatever, except possibly the verse in John which reads "Jesus wept." The move backwards to get at what is behind the text and try to arrive at a genetic point - the first creation of the cultural tradition- is again something that can be carried to a point at which it loses its value as a part of literary discipline; so there has to be some kind of working mean, keeping the two activities running side by side. The good part of the traditional approach is that a myth or a kernel that you have in the literary tradition means everything that it has ever been made to mean. That is, if you take such a book as the Song of Songs and you examine it historically, it goes back to a set of village wedding songs which seem to have some ritual connection with certain aspects of dying-god religions that carry you behind the Bible to something pre-Biblical. But at a certain point you get involved in a good deal of guess work. If you go the other way, you find that its been transformed into an allegory representing the love of Christ for the Church, and that is how the great Spanish mystic St. John of the Cross made use of it in the sixteenth century in his Dark Night of the Soul Its no good saying that this kind of development has nothing to do with what the Song of Songs is. It is a part of its forward movement, its progression in culture, and so it is a part of what the Song of Songs means. The same thing is true of secular literature where what seem like very crude and primitive myths in Greek mythology will turn up in more or less disguised forms in the romances of Shakespeare, but what the original myths mean they mean still and mean much more profoundly and much more complexly in Shakespearean romance. The moral of all this, I think, is that our use of language is best off when we understand something of the variety of ways in which men have used it and have studied and expressed it. The use of language in Homer is founded on an intensely concrete world, where what you think is essentially what you breathe in, what you take into your lungs, because the lungs are the source of wisdom in Homer. The brain, on the other hand, is the source of vitality. This was not necessarily a metaphorical way of thinking of things to Homer, but it is to us. That's the only way that we can read it. This extremely concrete world is a world that has lost its immediacy for us except through metaphor and through the peculiar magic of poetry. That means that the function of language has at its center the recreation of that intensely vivid, metaphorical, and magical sense of words not as describing things but as calling things into being. We can perhaps understand that if we have</page><page sequence="12">408 Northrop Frye run through all the stages of Vicos cycle we don't have to go around the cycle again. It seems to me that once you come to the end of the cycle the thing to do is to go on to another plane. So I am greatly encouraged by the fact that the descriptive use of language is giving way in our own time to a study of language itself: the whole movement of structuralism, the sense of the linguistic model, of language as something that interconnects literature and religion and the social sciences and not only makes sense of all those as a structure but also brings us sharply up against the essential mystery in the use of words which we find in the early phase of language and which we find reflected in Homer and in the Old Testament. It's no accident, I think, that philosophers in our own day, like Heidegger, and people like Georges Poulet in criticism are speaking in terms of language as something autonomous, as something which expresses itself whatever we do to it. In saying that they are only saying what all of the poets have said- Keats, Wordsworth, T.S. Eliot. They've all said the same thing. The poet does not think of himself as making his poems. He thinks of himself as a place where poems happen. He feels that words are taking their own form independently of his will and that there is something in his activity which is like that of a mother; his job is like that of a mother; his job is to bring some kind of independent life into being. So we come up against the final paradox that man does use language but there is also a sense in which language uses him. Man makes words but there is also a sense in which words make him. It's not only that they condition him but that they transform his being. To understand that point, I think we need also to understand that the plunging into a work of literature is a long and fascinating journey. There are certain stages in it, and it is that I would like to examine tomorrow night, when I will be speaking particularly of the levels of meaning that one goes through on this journey. II I am returning tonight to a question that has preoccupied me for quite a long time: the question of the different levels of meaning and the way that that operates in the study of literature. So perhaps I might take a retrospective glance over the question as it has appeared to me in the twenty odd years since I produced a book called the Anatomy of Criticism. In retrospect it seems clear that what I was trying to do in that book was something that had already been done in linguistics by Saussure at the beginning of the century. Saussure, the French linguist, distinguished what he called langue</page><page sequence="13">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 409 and parole, th e parole being what the individual, say, Frenchman contributes to the French language and langue being the totality of the language itself as a cultural force.2 And I was similarly trying not merely to study individual works of literature, individual poets, but also to raise the possibility of there being something corresponding in literature to the langue in linguistics, to the totality of literature as a single body. Since I wrote that book, the whole structuralist movement has begun to emerge, and that assumption of literature as forming a certain total body of articulateness is more generally accepted. According to Piaget, who was one of the great theoreticians of structuralism, every structure contains within itself a body of transformations, and the transformations in literature- the way in which it changes from one period to another - seem to be guided by the force that we call convention.3 And literature seems to operate in a somewhat Darwinian way: it throws out mutations more or less at random and descends through whatever has the greatest survival value. The question of what the survival value is is determined by the pattern of society and usually by what the ascendant class wants in the way of culture. In this situation it is usually popular literature that tells us what is going to happen next. In Elizabethan literature, for example, there is a fully flourishing poetic drama, but there is a rather embryonic art of prose fiction which is aimed at middle class readers and is produced by popular writers like Thomas Deloney. But that kind of middle class fiction, about how somebody works hard, saves his money, and eventually becomes a rich man and the lord mayor of London, gives you the clue to the kind of literature that is going to be dominant when the particular class which that addresses comes to power, as it does around the time of Defoe about a century later. Literature at different periods goes into different stages of a kind a cultural flowering followed by a kind of subsidence into more popular formulas. At the end of the eighteenth century, for example, the extremely sophisticated and civilized movement that produced Swift and Pope and Samuel Johnson begins to disintegrate and you begin to have a rise of more popular literature, like the gothic horror novels, or a new kind of poetry, like Blake's Songs of Innocence or Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads , which is founded on essentially popular art forms, such as keepsake books and the like. And that relapse, if you can call it a relapse, is popular and primitive, because the two things are really the same thing in literature. The primitive is simply the popular in a temporal dimension. There is still the</page><page sequence="14">410 Northrop Frye same thing going on. There was a tremendous outburst of creative genius in this century between about 1920 and about 1950- one of the greatest outpourings of literary genius, I suppose, in history. Since 1950 the same process has happened. These popular elements of literature have become much more prominent, with the rise of science fiction, with the rise of folk song and ballad writers. And there is a certain democratization going on, which again brings out some of the popular correlates. But we find that with all this social change the structural patterns of literature change far less than one would expect. The popular and primitive forms that turn up in these periods of transition usually come up with very much the same formulas as they did before, and that is one reason why the structural principles of literature are so astonishingly long-lived, why it is that the structure and stock characters of comedy have changed very little since the time of Aristophanes, and the formulas of romance are the same now that they were in Greek times. That means that while there can be infinite variety in the individual work of literature the number of actual structural principles involved is very strictly limited. What we call content in literature is really the structure of the individual work as distinct from the genre or convention that it belongs to. I think that in our time, besides a period of popular and primitive writing, we are also intellectually going through a tremendous reintegrating and regrouping of certain areas of knowledge and scholarship. And it seems to me the whole movement of structuralism portends a kind of realignment of literature, religion, the humanities and the social sciences in which the perception of language, and more particularly the linguistic model, is one of the central powerhouses. And it is that situation which has naturally got me interested again in the cultural importance of the Bible and its perspective within the study of secular literature. The Bible is for one thing a logocentric book. It uses the phrase "Word of God" as something that has a very intimate and central relationship to the nature and the destiny of man. I'm interested, apart from the question ofbelief that would be of interest to anyone, to see how so many twentieth-century philosophers speak of language not as something that man uses but as something that makes use of man, which is again a very Biblical view. And for the last century or so, I suppose most of our philosophy has really been founded on Hegel, especially Hegel's Phenomenology of the Spirit, which is a great voyage of intellectual discovery ending with the principle that spirit can be understood only by spirit - which again is the central Biblical view. This is not necessarily a matter ofbelief, as I say, but a matter of perspective</page><page sequence="15">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 411 and, to some degree of scholarship. So in returning to the Bible- an interest that has preoccupied me from the beginning because I began my career with the study of Biblical writers, such as Milton and Blake - it is obvious that no book can have had so specific and concrete a literary influence without itself having literary qualities. At the same time it would be preposterous to say that the Bible was a work of literature, or that the response to it was ultimately the same as the response to Dante or to Shakespeare. And that was something that actually has increased its fascination for me. Even Blake, who went so much further than most people go in identifying religion and art, did not call the Bible a work of art. He said, the Old and the New Testaments are "the great code of art,"4 a very haunting and suggestive phrase which I have been pondering for a great many years. But a book which is not a work of art but "the great code of art" is clearly a book which takes us beyond the category of literature into the larger of area of the social function of words. That fascinates me, because all my critical life I have been very suspicious of the role of value judgments as a factor in criticism. Value judgments seem to be the tentative assumptions we make in beginning the study of literature. We are informed by our elders and betters that Shakespeare and Milton are extremely good poets. We adopt these assumptions and proceed on them in our own study of literature, and we find that in fact they were. But as assumptions made at the beginning of study they are still subject to revision, and they are not an end of criticism but a by-product of it. The acceptance of the value judgment that Shakespeare is a great poet has accounted for a immense variety and quantity of criticism and commentary, but none of that criticism and commentary has actually been founded on the value judgment. With such a book as the Bible, which has had so tremendous a role to play in our cultural tradition, all value judgments are palpably absurd and futile. We also begin to realize that value judgments keep us within a category of literature, and a book which has literary qualities that burst through those categories and burst through all value judgments as well seems to be holding the key to something important in the study of literature. One of the commonest experiences that we have in studying literature is the feeling that, after reading the book, there is more to be got out of this book. That is a feeling that not only effects all those who have ever tried to teach literature but haunts them, because what they say in the course of teaching, say, Paradise Lost is so miserably inadequate that they console themselves by feeling that if they had twenty years with this class they might be able to get something said about it. But what is important, I think, in this</page><page sequence="16">412 Northrop Frye connection is that this feeling that there is more to be got out of what we are reading doesn't necessarily mean something that we have overlooked the first time. It may mean that there is a progress in the reading act itself, that there may be actual degrees or stages of comprehension. This is a very old idea in literary criticism, and my interest in it was revived when I realized that the book I referred to a moment ago, Hegel's Phenomenology of the Spirit, the cornerstone of modern philosophy, was in fact the same doctrine of different levels of meaning all over again. In fact, even the metaphor of levels is preserved in Hegel's key term Aufhebung. But the Middle Ages was particularly the period that classified and worked up the stages in the dialectic of reading and understanding. The most familiar comes from Dante, and Dante takes the Bible as the model for all serious secular literature, including his own poem. He is following a fairly standard medieval principle of criticism when he works out a theory of a progression of understanding through four levels. He takes a verse from the Psalms, "When Israel came forth from Egypt" - that's the key phrase. He says when you first read that sentence you read it literally, and the literal meaning is the point at which you start. The literal meaning, says Dante, is the historical meaning. It refers to the event, say around 1500 B.C. or whenever it was, that the Israelites walked out of the Egypt of Rameses II or whoever the pharoah of the exodus was. But you realize that when it occurs in the Bible in the context of the Psalms, it is not simply a reference to a historical event. What it is is one of the principles in the interpretation of the Bible as a whole, which is the bedrock of the whole Christian faith; so that the literal meaning leads you to what Dante calls the second level or the allegorical level, which is the meaning quid credas , what you believe. In the Christian view of the Bible the first principle is that everything that happened in the Old Testament pre-figures something that happens in the New Testament, and specifically that the story of Israel in the Old Testament prefigures the life of Christ in the Gospels. In the story of the exodus, you have the near massacre of Hebrew children at the time of the feast of the Passover, the plunge through the Red Sea in which the Egyptians are drowned and the Israelites go through dry shod, and then the creation of the nation of Israel on the opposite bank. That is a préfiguration of the three-day drama in the Gospels where Christ dies on the cross on the feast of the Passover on Friday, descends to the lower world on Saturday, and on Sunday morning awakens again and has redeemed the world. So that this reference of Israel coming forth from Egypt is a reference to the entire structure of the Bible and by implication of the Christian faith itself. However, says Dante, that</page><page sequence="17">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 413 understanding itself is only an understanding. It is of no particular value to us until it becomes a part of our experience, until it becomes a part of our life. That, by implication, is the principle that the end of the study of all literature from the Bible down to our own time is not the admiration of the work of literature but the possession of it and the incorporation of it into our own experience. So, says Dante, there must be a third level, the level of quid agaSy what you do, because what you believe has to be incorporated into the Christian life, the moral life which acts out the faith of the past. Even so, says Dante, you have not reached the end of the pilgrimage, because the moral life ends with death, and in the Christian perspective there is a world beyond that, the world of eternity, the world quo tendas , where you are going. It is that world which fulfills a place, the progression of understanding on the fourth level. So you read a verse in the Psalms. You find that it refers literally to a historical event, allegorically to the whole structure of the Bible, morally to your own soul which is to follow Israel after Christ in the descent through death to redemption, and finally, in relation to the salvation of the soul, out of the world of time. Now that can be applied, I think, to the reading of secular literature very well. It has, of course, certain drawbacks as a principle to apply to secular literature in our day. It assumes the exclusive and definitive truth of its own particular medieval version of Catholic Christianity. So it will hardly do for an age that has to attempt some kind of dialogue with people of very different attitudes. Even more important, you notice that at every stage of Dantes four levels of meaning the words are being subordinated to something that are not words. On the level of the literal reading, the words that you read merely convey the truth of the historical event. On the next level, they merely convey the faith that you have. On the next or moral level, they are merely an aphorism conveying one of the needs of your own experience. And on the final level they are merely words conveying something like the beatific vision. This is hardly a view of words that seems to fit the Bible itself which, after all, is built around the whole principle that "in the beginning was the Word." So one wonders if there isn't a way of reconstructing this principle of Dantes so as to make it a more practicable scheme for the study of literature today. Lets start with the literal meaning, and here I have to go back to a principle I have already stated in some of my other books. It doesn't seem to me that a body of words can be literally anything but a body of words. I dont see that literal meaning can be the relation of a body of words to</page><page sequence="18">414 Northrop Frye a body of historical events or whatever, lhe literal meaning seems to be the meaning you get when you are looking at a body of words simply as words without concerning yourself with any part of external reference. That means that the narrative of what you read is self-contained. It means that the images of what you read are related primarily to each other rather than to the things that they signify in the world outside. Further, if you stop to think, you can see that it is only when you are reading poetry that you can take the conception of literal seriously. It is only when you are reading a poem that you can accept every letter of every word given you without question. That suggests to me the general principle that in the Bible, and in fact everywhere else, the literal meaning is the poetic meaning. lhe Bible and any other work may be very much more than a work of literature, but it has to start with that. That is its literal basis. Unless we accept that kind of literalism, it seems to me we go very badly astray on the other levels. Now, every body of words that can be read from the first page to the last page has a narrative. A narrative means words set out sequentially, and all books have narratives that can be read sequentially, that is, all books except telephone books and perhaps the occasional dictionary. That narrative has to be taken first of all as self-contained. The word "myth" means a great many things in a great many disciplines. To me, as a literary critic, it means, first of all, what Aristotle meant by it, mythos , that is, narrative. Consequently, the myth of any body of words, to me, is first of all the narrative of that body of words- the way you understand it when you read from page one to page x. We distinguish the words "history" and "story," for example. They were originally the same word, but now we think of a history as a narrative of words that follows a course of events in the world outside. Story we think of as a narrative which is self-contained, which exists only within that body of words. Now that's OK, except that all narratives are equally myths, as I see it, whether they are true or not, whether they refer to actual events or not. You take such a book as Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. That was a book that was intended to be a history rather than a work of literature. It was supposed to be a book of words which followed events in the late Roman Empire. Yet it has a narrative. You can read it page by page. And you begin to discover that it has a narrative principle, which is indicated in the title, "decline and fall." Here was Gibbon, sitting on the steps of the capítol hill in Rome - a comfortable little eighteenth-century agnostic suddenly being picked up by some mysterious force that he never turned around to look at and stuck in a library to scribble frantically for the</page><page sequence="19">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 415 rest of his life about the decline and fall of the Roman empire. Well, the operation confronted him with a vast, amorphous pile of documents. But he had the magic wand: he had the myth of "decline and fall." That was the principle on which he selected his material. That was the magic wand by which he could make this vast mass of documents obey his will. Without the myth the book would have been entirely shapeless and, of course, would never have been written at all. So whether a story is factual or regarded as such or not has no effect on its possession of myth. That is what it must have, regardless of anything else. I spoke last night of the different phases of language. In the first phase of language, which was metaphorical and with a strong magical feeling about it, and a concrete one, nearly all myths are story-myths. And the most important structures within which a society expresses itself verbally in that phase are stories usually about the gods, sometimes about the traditional history and legends of the cultural unit, whatever it is. As we move into phase two, where words are taken as expressions of thoughts or ideas, the story-myths turn into argument-myths, and we have philosophers expounding metaphysical systems which usually can be shown to derive from the story-myths which preceded them. Then again, it is a very ancient principle, in fact it was formulated by Aristotle, that the difference between the poetic, that is the purely mythical, the self-contained myth, and the historical, the myth that has an external reference to events, is that the history gives you particular events and the poetic gives you universal ones, which means, among other things, that the poet concentrates more on the mythical shape of the story than on its content. Again, if you look in the Bible at the Book of Judges, for example, you begin to realize very quickly that you are being told the same story over and over again. Different tribal heroes - Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, Samuel - all arise in the identical situation. Israel has deserted its God. As a result it has met with disaster, foreign invasion, enslavement, bondage. It cries to God for help. God sends the deliverer in the form of a judge. The judge cleans up on the enemies, and Israel is restored to prosperity until it forgets itself again. They seem to have had a remarkable talent for doing that. Now that is a history where the main emphasis falls on the shape of the story being told rather than on the content of what occurred in it, and that emphasis on shape is a mythical emphasis. The shape in the Book of Judges is essentially a U-shape. Israel goes down into bondage or exile or captivity and then comes up again through the activity of the judge. That U-shape is the organizing shape of the Bible, which begins with Adams out of the</page><page sequence="20">416 Northrop Frye Garden of Eden and restored to it at the very last page of the Bible. It turns up in books which are not histories at all, like the Book of Job. It turns up in such things as Jesus' parable of the prodigal son. That structural principle shows the strong mythical interest in the Bible, and, consequently, a factor there which helps to reinforce the principle that its literal meaning is in fact its poetic meaning. Along with narrative there is also the body of interconnecting images. When you are reading something factual or descriptive, these images refer separately to what they mean in the outer world. But if you are looking at a self-contained body of words simply as that, then the images interlock together, and their primary relationship is to one another. And when two images are related primarily to each other, rather than separately to two things in the outer world, you have a metaphor which is the central or key figure of speech. Again, a glance at the Bible shows that metaphor is not an ornament of language there; it is the controlling method of thought. You open the end of the Book of Genesis, with Jacob's prophecy of the twelve tribes, and you find sets of metaphors there: "Joseph is a fruitful bough." "Naptali is a hind let loose." "Issachar is a strong ass" (49:22, 21, 14). Those are metaphors where A is B, a statement of identification. You say, well, after all these are only poetic metaphors. You don't need to take them too seriously. Then you turn to the Gospels and see that Jesus again is talking about himself entirely in metaphors: "I am vine, you are the branches" [John 15:1]. "I am the way" [John 14:6]. "I am the door" [John 10:9]. The question arises, how seriously do we take these? It's clear that he meant them rather seriously. This takes us back to that principle in the Bible which I mentioned in connection with Dante, the relationship of the Old Testament to the New, where the Old Testament events are a type of what happens in the New Testament. The relationship is not a relationship of allegory, which is a relation of poetic image to abstract concept. The relation is one of typology, where a real nation with real history and with real events in it is being paralleled to a single man's life. That suggests that the central metaphor of all metaphors is what I think of as the royal metaphor, the metaphor in the word "body," which means both the body of the individual and the unity of the society to which he belongs. I call it the royal metaphor because the origin of kinship is obviously connected with the metaphorical need to see in some individual the society as an individual. We find that today Queen Elizabeth or President Carter or corresponding figures in Marxist countries draw crowds wherever they appear, not because there is anything miraculous</page><page sequence="21">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 417 about their appearance but because they dramatize the unification of a society in an individual form. The fact that the principle upon which the Bible is constructed is typological, with the history of a nation paralleling the life of a man, means, of course, that it has a uniquely historical character as compared with most religions. The historical quality in the Biblical religion was a commonplace. Jesus and Adonis are both dying gods. They both have very similar bodies of imagery and even ritual attached to them. But Jesus is a person, and Adonis is not. One belongs in what I think of as diachronic myth, that is, myth which is historical. The other belongs in synchronic myth, which is connected with the cycle of nature turning from winter to spring year after year. That in its turn is connected with the peculiarly Western sense of history as having a meaning in itself. What typology is in the Bible funda- mentally is a theory of history. It tells you that there is something in the historical process that has a point, which is going somewhere, and which will eventually reveal its nature. That teleological sense of time as moving in a certain direction is one of the most profoundly culturally conditioning factors that I think we have in our own tradition. That takes us, then, into the level of belief where we seem to be moving outside the study of literature altogether, because literature is concerned with something which is simply hypothetical, something which is not addressed to belief at all. And yet the end of the study of literature, as I suggested, is one of personal possession rather than simply the admiring of an objective masterpiece. Part of the clue to this, I think, is the fact that there are two contexts for the word "belief." There is first of all what you say you believe, which is usually what you think you believe and what you believe you believe. This kind of belief is essentially a statement of solidarity with a certain social group. It is this level of belief- of professed belief- that marks you as a Methodist or a Catholic or a Zen Buddhist or a Marxist or whatever. Don Quixotes belief that that windmill in front of him was actually a hundred-armed giant was a statement of his solidarity with the knights errant that he had read about in romances. But what you really believe is what your actions show you believe, and consequently Dantes two principles, quid credas (what you believe) and quid agas (what you do) really turn out to be the same thing. What a society does is a key to its beliefs and has to be the basis of any kind of phenomenology of belief, because the professed belief is so often, however unconsciously, a rationalization of something else altogether. But the question of belief reminds us that we are all are all brought up in a society and are all contained by something</page><page sequence="22">418 Northrop Frye which has been constructed by the human imagination, something which I would call a mythological universe. That is, we are all conditioned to participate in society through our imagination, not through our reason. And the mythological universe which surrounds us like atmospheric pressure, which we inherit at infancy and never grow out of, has also all these levels of meaning I'm dealing with tonight. The mythological universe that surrounds us includes all the really serious beliefs that we have. First of all, you get a level of utterly phony mythology, a level addressed by advertising and by propaganda, that is expressed by all the clichés you can pick up on the streets and all the silly prejudices about minority groups that are a product of certain forms of class conditioning - the phony aspect of mythology has been quite extensively explored in our time by Roland Barthes, for example, in his book Mythologies, and by Marshall McLuhan in his book The Mechanical Bride. Behind that, however, are the real informing myths of our lives, of which we normally become conscious in some kind of crisis. In our society we do grow up with very powerful beliefs in things like democracy and equality of opportunity and so on, but it's only in something like the Watergate crisis where we begin to realize how immensely powerful these myths are. In times of relaxation we're inclined to take them more lightly. But we can understand from that how, as Roland Barthes says, there are no innocent writers in literature.5 That is, every writer expresses the beliefs and values of his own time. That is both a positive factor and a negative factor; it's positive in that he has beliefs, and it's negative in that they have some limitations which look particularly limited to us after the passing of a great many centuries. So a great deal of this uncovering of the ideological basis of literature is a kind of debunking activity where the critic is trying to discover the workings of those sinister forces that Martin Luther identified with the devil and contemporary Marxist critics with the bourgeois mind. Still, this universal belief, while it conditions the workings of the imagination at every point and in every period of history, is also something one can grow out of, not outgrow, but grow out of in the sense in which a plant grows out of its roots. That leads us to the question of what is the equivalent for our day of Dante's anagogie or fourth level of vision, the one which is related to eternity rather than time and which is connected with the question of what speaks from beyond death. That is one of the fundamental questions raised in the Bible itself and it enters into all our study of literature in different ways. Now obviously, the first question that occurs to you when you ask the</page><page sequence="23">Reconsidering Levels of Meaning 419 question, "What speaks to you from beyond death?" is a poet who has been dead for many centuries. You are introduced thereby to one of the ultimate mysteries of literature in the power of communication across the centuries and across the barriers of cultural differentiation. The study of literature therefore is a means of making one a member of a community beyond death, a community of the human imagination which has survived thousands of years of empires that have come and gone and is still adding to and building up its central imaginative structures. But along with the question of what speaks from beyond death is also the question of what speaks from beyond life. I was reading recently Oscar Wildes essay on "The Decay of Lying," which is to some extent the manifesto of modern criticism, and in that essay Wilde makes a wonderfully profound insight in a very casual way, throwing it out as though it were a kind of joke. Two young men are talking together, and one of them says, Shall I play something for you? lhe other one says, No, I dont want to hear music at this point, because what music does is create the full range of our own past experience.6 That is, if a person suddenly, without warning, came across somebody playing a piece of great music he might suddenly realize at that point that he had in his past gone through immense ranges of experience of which he was totally unconscious. Now in that form the statement sounds paradoxical, but surely it is an essential function of art to acquaint us with the whole possible range of our experience as distinct from what we actually experience, and to that extent it not only fills the gap in our experience but reintegrates our past. Our five senses are, after all, filters. They screen out far more than they take in. And the brain, I suspect, is not the generator of consciousness but a machine for filtering consciousness. There is a whole universe of significance of which we get glimpses in the arts but which our ordinary experience misses. I was looking at Shakespeares Winters Tale recently and noticing how that was constructed as a comedy which begins with a tragic action, which is the winter s tale proper, and then goes on to the triumph of the comic forces. There are at least two comic forces in play - nature and art. The triumph of nature is given you in the great sheep-shearing festival scene in the fourth act, where the imagery changes from the winter to the spring and where the main characters are no longer the older characters of the earlier part of the play but young people, a young man and a young woman who want to get married. And by all the rules of comedy and romance they will get married in spite of all the efforts their parents make to keep them apart. So the triumph of nature is associated with rebirth, with renewal, with the spring following winter, with youth following age, with the whole turning cycle of</page><page sequence="24">420 Northrop Frye nature on its way out just before it starts to go down again. But that is not really where the play ends. The play ends with a re-integration of the older pair, a man who has killed his wife by jealousy but who is made to watch while somebody brings on what is said to be her statue, and at a certain point the statue comes to life. In this final scene of the play the atmosphere is entirely the atmosphere of art. The setting is inside a building. The older woman who comes to life is alleged to be a work of painting and sculpture. She is brought to life by the playing of music, and there is poetry. All the arts are involved. What happens there is the reintegrating of the past, and it is through the power of art that this is done. So that the power seems to have something to do with that thrust which we saw was peculiar to our historical consciousness in the West, except that it need not necessarily be a thrust into the future as something that only posterity will know anything about. It can also be a thrust upward, a transformation from a world of death into a world of life, a world not of rebirth and renewal but of resurrection, which is really what happens in the final scene of Shakespeare's play. That is why, I think, so much of modern thought and criticism keeps revolving around the conceptions I mentioned at the beginning, of the language which is not so much something man uses as something that makes use of man and of the spirit which in the long run does not finally comprehend nature but rather comprehends itself. That is the direction, I think, in which the reintegrating which I spoke of is going on - religion and the humanities and the social sciences and many other subjects in our own time. But I suspect, to use a figure from Blake that has haunted me all my life, that in the center of this whole reintegrating movement is literature and the study of literature, and that it is literature and the study of literature which is holding the end of a golden string.7 NOTES '"O Worship the King," stanza 2; words by Robert Grant (1779-1838; music arranged from J.
