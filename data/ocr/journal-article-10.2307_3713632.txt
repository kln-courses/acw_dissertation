<plain_text><page sequence="1">GATIEN DE COURTILZ, SIEUR DU VERGER', A PRECURSOR OF LESAGE, I. EVERYBODY has read Les Trois Mousquetaires, and knows that Dumas acknowledges his obligation to an old volume in the Bibliotheque Royale. In fact d'Artagnan2 and his three friends appear in an anonymous work first published in 1700. This book, though purporting to be a simple rearrangement of the authentic M4moires of Captain d'Artagnan, was soon recognized as the work of a prolific scribe, known as Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (1644 ?-1712). Contemporary notices of Courtilz are due to the desire of precise historians to refute the popular idea that his supposed Mgmoires were authentic history8. Even in our own day some writers accept too credulously the anecdotes of this clever mystifier. A hungry hack, his sole aim was to please. Among the genres which were already in vogue, he chose those best suited to his temperament, and stamped them with the seal of his personality. He invariably pretended to disclose hidden historical fact, and reveal the cryptic motives which actuated prominent personages. His real object was to lure the public with scandal, and in this he succeeded amazingly. He ignored the critics who exposed his impudent mendacity; never signing his work with his own name, he thus avoided condemnation at sight; he ascribed his writings, now to a veteran who had witnessed the incidents described, now to a courtier long familiar with the manners 1 The author wishes to express his gratitude to his colleagues, Professors Casis and Villavaso, and to Professors Trent and Woodbridge, who have kindly criticised his manuscript. He is under special obligation to Professor Fitzmaurice-Kelly for invaluable editorial critioism. A complete treatment of the writings of Courtilz with his biography is to appear shortly. 2 Strictly speaking he should be called M. d'Artagnan or Artagnan, but it seems best to preserve the name under which he is famous. 8 See Bayle, Diet., esp. art.

Courtilz took such precautions to conceal his personality that bio- graphical details are scarce. Uncertain as to his real name, contem- poraries knew next to nothing of his life. Yet, despite insufficient data, some idea of the man's character may be formed. Jack-of-all-trades, he put his hand to every kind of work, however dubious; he had shrewdly observed all manner of adventurers; as a soldier he had amassed a treasure of military anecdotes, and had doubtless discussed at length with his comra'des the conduct of his chiefs and the vicissitudes of politics A Paris pamphleteer, he knew all such gossip about prominent contemporaries as was current in antechambers and guardrooms. Finally, while imprisoned at the Bastille, he must have spent hours comparing notes with his fellows. In studying his work, there will be occasion to remark his powers of observation and his retentive memory. To these natural gifts he owed many of his faults, and most of his merits, as a writer. Of him, as of the moralists, we may say that he gave back to society the good and the evil he had observed in it. But it must be added that his eyes turned by preference to one side of the medal. Courtilz began his literary career as a pamphleteer, a hawker of political and social scandal. He wrote by turns for and against his country's policy; he exposed with no little gusto the unedifying private life of courtiers and great ladies. It cannot be said that everything in these writings is false; there is only too much reason to believe that Courtilz gives a fairly truthful picture of profligate Paris in his time. It is certain, however, that he did not seek truth for its own sake. Ribald gossip proved good copy, and was remunerative. The rapid rise of France aroused violent protests. Louis XIV was accused of aiming at universal empire, and of using any means, fair or foul, to attain his end. His partisans answered with abuse of his assailants, and with exaggerated flattery of the king. Courtilz had a foot in both camps. In 1683 there appeared two pamphlets entitled: La Conduite de la France... and RMponse au livre intituld: La Conduite, etc. There is good reason to believe that Courtilz wrote both, hoping thus to reap a double harvest. In the first he heaps unmeasured abuse on the policy of France, and in the second (purporting, of course, to be from another hand) he refutes a part of his previous allegations, and contradicts the rest. Setting a thief to catch a thief, we may quote one phrase which applies to all the author's work. The Reponse remarks of 476</page><page sequence="3">BENJAMIN M. WOODBRIDGE the writer of the Conduite: ' Je dirais qu'il les aurait puis6s [ses raison- nements] entibrement dans les Gazettes, n'6tait qu'il y ajoute beaucoup du sien, afin, comme je crois, de deguiser le vol qu'il y a fait.' A third pamphlet, the pretentious title of which may be abridged to ESvenements remarquables, was published the same year. It is interesting because it displays clearly certain traits which characterize all Courtilz' work. The ostensible purpose is to glorify the existing government by contrasting it with the disorder which marked the last years of Louis XIII and continued during the Fronde. But the greater part of the book is packed with anecdotes of this troubled period in which Courtilz so often set his scenes. The announcement of his purpose in the preface recurs in all his works; he has access to some secret source of information and promises 'des particularites inconnues.' And so he indulges his passion for attributing pettiness to the great, and affects to illuminate important events with scurrilous anecdotes. Another series of pamphlets in which the desire to exploit scandal is still more apparent is re- presented by Les Conqu4tes Amoureases du Grand Alcandre dans les Pays-Bas. This libel, like others with similar titles published by Courtilz shortly afterwards, is allied to Bussy-Rabutin's Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules. Although carelessly written, it and its fellows show a certain talent for fleet narration and burlesque scenes. Courtilz returns to politics with the Nouveaux Interets des Princes de l'Europe, published in 1685. Here he formulates a Machiavellian doctrine accepted by all his heroes. Further, some attention is due to the method of the book, which is suggested by the Duc de Rohan's work, De l'Interest des Princes et Estats de la Chrestientd, printed in 1639; this contains a summary discussion of the policy which princes should follow for the aggrandizement of their states. There is nothing original in the maxims, which are practically identical with Machiavelli's cynical theories. While the duke lays down general laws, Courtilz studies the changing phases of politics. He had his eye on the men and problems of the moment, and tried to express them to the life. The same method, characteristic of all his work, explains his success in passing off his novels as genuine history. Though some of the so-called Memoires begin under Richelieu, and though the author lingers long over the scenes of the Fronde, he closes near the time of composition. To deceive his contemporaries he was bound not to depart too far from verisimilitude. This is the secret of his realism. Owing to its journalistic quality the Nouveaux Intirets was soon out of date. The need for constant revision seems to have suggested the 477</page><page sequence="4">Gatien de Courtilz idea of a political monthly gazette, the Mercure Historique et Politiquel. This review, edited by Courtilz from November 1686 to Marcli 1689, resembles the former treatise in content. The author disavowed all moral responsibility, and would say with Machiavelli, that he had only put at the service of sovereigns what their policy had taught him; on all sides he had watched the practical working of the maxim: 'qui ne sait pas dissimuler, n'est pas digne de remplir le tr6ne.' Yet the writer's heroes are not impossible fantastic villains: they sow their wild oats like the rest, for, as d'Artagnan says: 'la jeunesse ne demande que d'avoir un pied toujours en l'air'; but fundamentally they are such average honest men as one might find without Diogenes' lantern. Their hands are smirched with intrigue, but the trickery is practised in the interest of the great; they serve their employers faithfully, while their fingers itch to unmask their paymasters. Although occupied with practical politics and plots, Courtilz knew how to render character. In Richelieu and Mazarin and many others we see the real men; their confidential servants, the heroes of the Memoires, make it their business to reveal to us the inner workings of the minds of these masters of statecraft. This method of portraiture by anecdotic illustration-the method of Plutarch2-appears fully developed in Courtilz' biographies of Turenne and Gaspard de Coligny. These are perhaps the only great men at whom he never scoffs. As an old soldier, he could appreciate military qualities, and he presents this pair of pala- dins as most accomplished leaders and as gentlemen without reproach. Here then is the cult of the hero, a hero whose character is conveyed in a vehicle of anecdote. This method has, of course, alternative possibilities: other incidents may be chosen or those chosen may be given a different turn, so that demigods are reduced to plain men and women. This is the plan followed by literary picaros, and Gil Blas at the Spanish court had predecessors among his creator's fellow-country- men. Not for nothing had Courtilz lived under the' Fronde, and sat round camp-fires with veterans of the civil wars. At heart a frondeur, he looked on respect for traditional authority as an inviting bubble. It called for pricking: he pricked it with indifferent cynicism. In the works already considered-they are among the first known writings of Courtilz-the man's temper and method are foreshadowed. 1 See Hermann Runge, Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras und die Anftinge des Mercure, Halle, 1886-7. 2 For a phrase which might be found in any of Courtilz' prefaoes, of. the life of Nicias, end of Chap. n (Amyot's translation). Several interesting parallels, espeoially with the life of Alex'nder, might be noted. 478</page><page sequence="5">BENJAMIN M. WOODBRIDGE But, had he written nothing else, he would have no claim even to the meagre interest which posterity takes in him. His real significance lies in his novels, or pseudo-memoirs. Here, as in his early pamphlets, he adopted a genre which had already met with favour, and, before examining the typical form of his novelistic work, it may be worth while to glance rapidly at a book which certainly gave him many hints. In 1676 appeared the Mdmoires du Sieur de Pontis, in which an old soldier tells the story of his life. The preface states that the memoirs were written from the account given by the captain after his retreat to Port-Royal. The anonymous author declares that Pontis was most unwilling to continue his story when he learned that there were thoughts of publishing it'. The hero, orphaned at the age of fourteen, goes to Paris to seek his fortune. Friends give him a letter to M. de Crequi, who obtains for him a post in the guards of Henry IV. His fortune varies, but at last he finds his place in the regular army of the king. He relates the story of his campaigns in the religious wars, but speaks only of the battles and sieges in which magna pars fuit. The Memoires become the chronicle of his personal exploits, and lose much of their vivacity. He lingers long over the capture of a demilune where he was the first to cross the trench, but he never speaks of the cause of the war, and hardly mentions the enemy. The reader is constantly invited to admire his dare-devil deeds, as his chiefs tell him off for the most perilous enterprises. He takes a naive pleasure in describing his private interviews with the king, and in insisting on the special favours accorded him. Here is a typical example which has more than one counterpart in Courtilz' novels: ' Le roi, qui voulait expr6s me temoigner beaucoup de froideur, pour mieux cacher l'intelligence secrete qui 6tait entre lui et moi, m'6coutait avec une con- tenance fiere, la main sur le c6t4, 6tant au milieu des deux cardinaux.' Weary at last of strife, Pontis retires to the abbey of Port-Royal. The story met with a considerable success, and no less a personage than the Abb6 Arnauld declares that it inspired the writing of his own Mdmoires. Though Courtilz is less ingenuous, many parallels might be cited to prove his indebtedness to Pontis. But he has enriched his matter, at the same time giving relief and probability to the exploits of his heroes, by the introduction of events in which they had no part. 1 For Pontis, see Ste-Beuve, Port-Royal, ii, pp. 570 ff.; P. Tamizey de Larroque, Revue d'Aquitaine, Aug., 1868, pp. 61 ff., and bibliography there cited. The M6moires were actually written by Pierre Thomas, sieur du Fosse (Lelong, Diet. Hist., No. 28788 (ed. of Fevret)). 479</page><page sequence="6">Gatien de Courtilz At one moment he exaggerates their rdle, at another he presents them as simple spectators discussing the actions of their contemporaries. There is also to be noted a marked difference in the spirit of the two men. Pontis is of a simple-minded sincerity: he takes life, as he takes himself, with quaint seriousness. For him the king rules by divine right; he accepts the whole social hierarchy as established. At times he perceives the selfish motives of courtiers, especially of Richelieu, but as a rule, if he permits himself anecdotes derogatory to prominent personages, this is done with a view to helping readers to understand these great men better. Courtilz mockingly analyses the power as well as the lives of potentates; he finds their estate maintained by means to which no private gentleman would stoop, and themselves moved by the same base passions as the lowliest of their subjects. He loves to emphasize the contrast between the majesty of these superior beings and their real character (so like his own). Pontis has glimpses of this resemblance, but reverences princes all the more: he would fain believe himself formed in the image of his gods. For Courtilz these gods are anthropomorphic, and their presumptuous vanity is proportionately ludicrous. He has given his own picaresque interpretation to Machiavelli's saying that a private citizen is in the best position to judge magnates. Not that the humble escape Courtilz' satire entirely; but he found a keener relish in flouting the pretensions of those in high places. The only two works of our author which have escaped oblivion are the Memoires de M.L.C.D.R. (1687), and the Memoires de M. d'Artagnan (1700). The first, usually known as the Memoirs of the Count of Rochefort, was Courtilz' first essay in this genre. The preface states that the author had charged his friends to destroy the manuscript, probably for fear of offending contemporaries by the unflattering anecdotes related at their cost. Similar prefaces precede all the novels, and seem meant as a bait to readers hungering for scandal. The Memoirs of Rochefort begin with the birth of the hero, brought prematurely into the world owing to a carriage accident. His mother died two days later, and his father, entrusting him to the care of a nurse, went up to Paris where he had many amatory adventures in which the provincial distrust of Parisians is amusingly depicted. He finally married a lady of his own province, who cruelly maltreated her step-son. Rochefort relates how, when a child, he joined a troop of gipsies, and a vivid page describing his life with them, includes a little novel of picaresque adventure in epitome. Quitting these vagabonds, he 480</page><page sequence="7">BENJAMIN M. WOODBRIDGE was attached to a military outpost and distinguished himself by surprising a Spanish officer at an amorous rendezvous. His accollnt of this incident, which smacks of bivouac gasconades, is typical: 'Pendant qu'ils s'amu- saient a faire l'amour, j'entrai, deux pistolets de ceinture a mes deux mains, et l'ayant desarme comme un mouton, je lui dis que s'il ne marchait devant moi, et sans rien dire, je lui allais mettre la bourre .dans le ventre.' The vigilant Richelieu hears of this feat, and summons our hero to court. On the way Rochefort halts at his native village, where the cur'i tells him of an accident which had thrown his family into despair. This story is of interest because it may well have suggested a similar adventure of Gil Blas. The cure relates how the elder Rochefort has just been robbed of a considerable sum of money by an ingenious trick. A relative was in trouble as the result of a love affair, and had gone into hiding. A band of rogues disguised themselves as constables, ransacked the house under pretext of searching for the fugitive, bound the owner and carried off all they could lay hands on'. Our wanderer arrives at this juncture and, being supposed to be himself in want, is so unwelcome that he is refused fodder for his horses. He smiles ironically, and his valet informs the household that his master has been called to court by Richelieu. As a prospective favourite of the minister, Rochefort now meets with a very different reception; relatives are summoned to do him honour, and all the village is agog. At court, Rochefort quickly gains the confidence of the cardinal, who entrusts him with various important secret missions. He cannot, how- ever, refrain from remarking: 'Je crois qu'il y avait plus de mystere a tout cela qu'e de necessite, et que ce n'etait que pour voir si on lui serait fidele, ou pour rendre son ministere plus estime par le secret.' Such skilful anticipations of the reader's criticism account in some measure for the wide acceptance which Courtilz' writings found. The 'mystery' in which Richelieu loved to shroud his acts has been a favourite theme with romancers. Rochefort's efforts are soon rewarded by the gift of a little abbey, which he presents to his friend, the village cure. His family, who had mocked at his offers of service, now overwhelms him with reproaches. A host of hitherto unknown relatives in his province besiege him for favours. Yet he is only a page at court. As a last test of fide- lity, Richelieu orders him to arrest his cousin and benefactor, the Marechal de Marillac. He obeys urwillingly, and is nearly disgraced for 1 For the parallel in Gil Blas, see Book vi, Chap, I. 481</page><page sequence="8">Gatien de Courtilz intervening on behalf of the prisoner, whose only crime was to have aroused the cardinal's jealousy. Rochefort is soon reinstated, however, and Richelieu suggests to him an advantageous marriage. Like all Courtilz' heroes, he is suspicious on this point, and, as he says, 'marche bride en main.' Having visited the young lady, and having readily understood why her parents wish to find her a husband, he breaks with them abruptly. They complain to Richelieu, who imprisons our hero, and, without deigning to listen to his defence, swears that he shall die. Hearing of this threat, Rochefort calmly reflects that 'les plus grands hommes se trompent comme les autres.' Pardoned as hastily as he was condemned, he is sent to Brussels to watch the intriguing Mme de Chevreuse. He goes disguised as a Capuchin, and, to throw spies off their guard, stays for some days before his departure at a monastery in Paris. He gaily relates his journey and his distaste for the monastic habit: ' Pour comble de malheur, il me fallut, aprbs cela, assister C l'6glise; tellement que je crus que le cardinal m'avait envoyd 1 pour faire mon purgatoire.' He discovers a plot against the court, and the Comte de Chalais, who was implicated, is shortly after beheaded. Returning to Paris, Rochefort fights a duel with an Englishman who had spoken disparagingly of his master. Three of the combatants are killed, and our hero is obliged to flee. He gives himself up soon after by the command of the cardinal, who secretly protects him during his trial. After his acquittal, Richelieu informs him that the prosecution was a matter of form to avoid scandal, and reminds him of the sentence of the Comtes de Bouteville and des Chapelles. The incident recalls the pardon granted to Pontis by Henry IV, but a new note is audible. In the midst of his gratitude, Rochefort cannot resist the malicious in- sinuation that a personal spite against the house of Condd had occasioned the execution of the famous duellists. There is also a characteristic trait of Courtilz' method: an adventure of his hero is introduced to exhibit the temper of potentates. Jealous of the power of the nobility, the cardinal had done his utmost to enforce the law against duelling when a Montmorency' was guilty, but he intervenes to save a private gentleman who enjoys his favour. Again, the too convincing description of the r6le played by Rochefort in the seizure of the original of Cinq Mars' treaty with Spain, is made the occasion for a vivid account of the tension between the king and the cardinal. It will be seen that Courtilz 1 For Bouteville, see Jal, Diet. Crit.; E. Colombey, Hist. Anec. du Duel, Chap. viii; E, and J. Halphen, Journal In6dit d'Arnauld d'Andilly. For the last duel see the Journal for the year 1627, pp. 16-20 and 26-85. 482</page><page sequence="9">BENJAMIN M. WOODBRIDGE is grossly inaccurate in detail: Richelieu never had anything but a copy of the famous treaty, and how he obtained even this is still a mystery. Yet the spirit of the moment is so vividly reproduced, that at least one historian1 cites Rochefort's account, though without guaranteeing its truth. After the death of his master, Rochefort attaches himself to the party of the Duc de Beaufort. Like all Courtilz' heroes, he hated Mazarin, whose sordid avarice, complaisance and perfidy he never tires of exposing. He passes rapidly over the Fronde2, having spent much time in prison during that period. Like many of his contemporaries, he learned the general moral of all the Mmnoires: ' Ce fut alors que je reconnus le peu de fonds qu'il y a C faire sur la parole des grands, lesquels nous promettent tout quand ils croient avoir affaire de nous, et nous oublient dbs que nous ne leur sommes plus n6cessaires.' The last half of the book is an incoherent medley of anecdotes. Some recount the personal experiences of the hero, others merely repeat stories he had heard. All are tinged with characteristic satire, and offer an interesting picture of certain features of contemporary life and manners. One of the best satirical portraits in the Mimoires is that of the Marquis de Pransac-a parvenu who planned to introduce himself into the aristocracy by means of blasoned equipages. He concocted a genealogy proving his royal descent; he displayed the arms of France, and assumed the title of Altesse. When the king took the affair in hand, the luckless marquis saw his carriages destroyed, and himself in peril. Rochefort, who had humorously encouraged the parvenu's whimsies, testified in his favour, and secured his acquittal as a maniac. One of the many law-suits in which Courtilz pays his respects to men of the robe may be cited. Rochefort is forced into litigation with his step-mother over the estate left by his father. His adversary, by falsifying documents, is on the point of winning, when a legal potentate who wishes to remain anonymous, offers him his daughter's hand. If he accepts, his suit is won. Our hero, forgetting his usual caution, is about to marry the unknown bride, but, on learning the name of his future father-in-law, he breaks into a diatribe against him. A fortnight later he loses his case, and is condemned to pay costs. Congratulating himself on his escape from the proposed alliance, he recounts sardoni- cally the lot of the wretch who later accepted a similar offer: 'La 1 B. de Bury, Histoire de la Vie de Louis XIII, Vol. iv, pp. 213-215. 2 Contrary to the custom of the M6moires.

As a result of this disastrous suit, our hero passes three years in prison, and, though he declares himself resigned to the will of Heaven, he never ceases to denounce laws and ministers. Released at last by the intervention of the archbishop of Lyons, he relates various anecdotes at the expense of his benefactor whose portrait is thus etched: 'En effet, c'est un archev6que entour6 de gardes, au lieu de pretres: suivant un cerf a la tete de cent chiens, au lieu de suivre la croix; faisant bonne chere, au lieu de faire abstinence; ne parlant que des grandeurs de la cour, au lieu de parler de l'humilite: et enfin, si fort a charge a la ville de Lyon, qu'il en est plut6t le tyran que l'archev6que.' A well-told incident is one in which Rochefort relates his experience with doctors-constant butts of the picaros, though more gently treated by Courtilz than might be expected. Our hero avers that a long illness had led him to reflect seriously and that he had begun to frequent the churches, where he heard much of a wonder-working friar. Wishing to see this man of miracles, he went to Flanders and thence to Germany. If he saw no miraculous cures, he experienced something very like one. A platform, on which he had climbed with a great crowd to see the marvels, broke down, and his arm was badly fractured. He had it set by the best doctor to be found, but after three weeks of horrible suffering, decided to consult the public executioner, who had some reputation as a surgeon. He is received gruffly enough by this irregular member of the profession, who bids his men, still red-handed from break- ing a wretch on the wheel, hold the patient; the executioner breaks the arm again, and resets it so well that in a few days Rochefort is as sprightly as ever1. Did space permit, it would be interesting to follow Rochefort further. Satirical flashes abound, and they testify to the author's observation of social conditions. Among other incidents, might be cited the description of a number of swindlers at a gambling den kept by the Duc de Cr6qui in his own mansion, in spite of the protests of honest folk. The reader 1 Another satirical touch may be cited from the Mgmoires du marquis de D * *. The marquis was surprised one day to meet in Italy his old valet dressed in gorgeous attire. The wag relates that he had been in the service of a famous physician, whose secrets were not much more complicated than those of Dr Sangrado. He observed his master's methods and soon beat him at his own trade. A suit followed, but he had prepared a rigmarole bristling with Greek and Latin which he recited so glibly that he was granted his degree with honour. 484</page><page sequence="11">BENJAMIN M. WOODBRIDGE is introduced to the tricks of the sharpers and to some of their victims; after which he learns that the duke maintained the establishment to give employment to two old soldiers, in lieu of a pension'. But, when summarized, the adventures lose much of their conspicuous vigour, which consists largely in picturesque detail, and graphic style. Enough has been cited to give an idea of the whole. Suffice it to add that, even in advancing age, Rochefort is constantly' brouille avec la justice,' or with his neighbours, or with both together, and at last, finding only bad faith and egoism on all sides, he decides to retire to a monastery, and ends his days as his prototype, Pontis, had done. II. The Memnoires de M. d'Artagnan were published in 1700. They are preceded by one of Courtilz' customary prefaces. The writer declares that he has merely pieced together papers left by the captain of musketeers. He says in part: 'Je m'en suis servi pour composer ces Memoires, en leur donnant quelque liaison. Ils n'en avaient point d'eux-memes, et c'est la tout l'honneur que je pretends me donner de cette ouvrage. Voila aussi tout ce que j'ai mis du mien2.' All of which simply indicates that the author himself felt the utter lack of coherence in his work, and wished to apologise for it. As someone has observed, if we take him at his word, he deserves no credit whatever. The want of quelque liaison is the worst fault of the book. It would be a thankless task to give anything like a connected analysis of it, and I will merely cite a few incidents of special interest. In general this work is of the same order as the Memoires de M.L.C.D.R. The hero, a young provincial, comes to court, enters the King's service, enjoys the confidence of many important personages, and portrays their character by recounting his relations with them, or by i I am far from guaranteeing the existence of such a den. D'Artagnan describes another in the Louvre. He found there, 'plus de presse qu'il ny en pouvait avoir au sermon du plus habile predicateur de Paris.' He adds: ' M. le duc de St. Simon tenait le de, et regardait cette somme comme indigne de sa colere.' However, D'Artagnan, with the proverbial luck of a novice, won a considerable sum which he carried in triumph to his mistress. This recalls the famous scene in Balzac, where the young Rastignac renders a similar service to Mme de Nucingen. 2 Owing perhaps to the fact that the hero is a well-known historical figure, this part of the preface has been taken too seriously by many readers in our own day, as well as by the contemporaries of the author. Bayle's repeated assertions that d'Artagnan had not written one word of the work will suffice to prove the credulity of readers of his time. The proper attitude is that of M. Samaran (D'Artagnan, Paris, 1912), who accepts nothing, without grave reserves, on the testimony of the Memoires alone. A more detailed study will show that this work is of the same texture as the other Mewmoires. 485</page><page sequence="12">Gatien de Courtilz glossing their acts from supposed secret information. He also attempts, as Rochefort fortunately did not, to write an historical chronicle of the epoch, and thus ruins the unity of the whole. The hero disappears entirely at times, buried under the interminable description of wars and diplomatic relations. In all this the reader is constantly invited to remark the Machiavellian politics of kings and ministers. The spirit is that of the Mercure. The most interesting portions of the book are the portrait of Mazarin and the personal adventures of the hero, who thus gives, as Dumas has it, 'tableaux de l'epoque.' The opening scenes-the arrival of the hero at Paris, his meeting with Porthos, Athos and Aramis, his first duels- all these have been made famous by Dumas. It may be said here that it is doubtful whether the expanded imitations have always equalled the original. Courtilz had surely known compatriots, at least, of d'Artagnan, and has rendered his portrait convincingly'. The liaison of the hero with his hostess (called by Dumas, Mme de Bonacieux) is vividly told in the Mdmoires. On one occasion, surprised by the jealous husband, he is obliged to jump from the window in scant attire. Friends furnish clothing, and he goes to complain to a magistrate to whom he tells a true Gascon's story. This precaution he deems necessary to justify: 'S'il est vrai qu'il n'y ait point de ville au monde ou il se fasse tant de cocus impun6ment qu'^ Paris...cet abus se punit dans de certains cas.' To assure himself of the magistrate's support, he leaves him a well- lined purse, and soon lands his man in the ChUtelet. Here the wretch was grievously illtreated by his guards, and 'commenga i connaitre qu'il eAt mieux fait de souffrir d'8tre cocu sans rien dire, que d'6tre expos4 C tant de peines et d'affronts pour s'en 6tre voulu plaindre.' D'Artagnan further takes measures to inform two varlets, imprisoned with their master, that their necks are in danger if they do not abscond. One of them was entirely innocent of the proposed assassination, but knowing 'qu'il se faisait bien des injustices a Paris, et que l'on n'y oondamnait pas moins d'innocents que l'on y sauvait de coupables,' both take advantage of the opportunity arranged for their escape. Their flight is then used to blacken the case of their master. However, the latter writes a touching letter to the brother-in-law of M. de Treville-an honest man, though a magistrate-and obtains his release.

WOODBRIDGE dame ne servissent h faire briller le m6rite d'un jeune homme; mais pour que cela f6t, il fallait que la dame fit d'un autre rang que celle que je voyais; que l'intrigue que l'on avait avec une femme de qualit6 passait pour galanterie, au lieu que celle que l'on avait avec celles qui ressemblaient &amp; ma mattresse, ne passait que pour d6bauche et pour crapule.' D'Artagnan feels the injustice of this rebuke, and in his com- mentary may be heard the accent of a revolt destined to grow stronger. Another picaro, named Figaro, was to say the same thing in more ringing tones nearly a century later. In general, these heroes relate their stories without adding their own reflexions-the facts speak for themselves. But this time d'Artagnan cannot refrain: 'Apres tout, le vice est toujours vice, et il n'est pas plus permis h une femme de qualitd de faire l'amour qu'i celle de la lie du peuple: mais comme l'usage autorisait ses reproches, je m'en trouvai si 6tourdi que je n'eus pas la force de lui repondre une seule parole.' An incident which shows the author's familiarity with street riots is the dramatic account of the day of the barricades, following the arrest of the parliamentary counsellor, Broussel. D'Artagnan had the curiosity to visit the scene, and, on answering 'Vive le roi et vive Broussel!' to the sentry's challenge, was promptly received. He was struck with the great quantity of wine, of which the rioters were making free use. He was obliged to drink with them in sign of good fellowship. While, as he says, 'je faisais pair et compagnon avec cette canaille,' a drunken ruffian asked his assistance in an attempt on the life of Mazarin. Our hero put off the would-be assassin, hoping that the night would bring sobriety and better counsel. When, on the following day he arrived at the rendezvous more excited than ever, d'Artagnan led him into an ambush of guards. To the great alarm of the cardinal the mob released him the same day. The episode is effective as a vivid picture of the spirit of the moment-of the power of the people and their hatred of Mazarin. D'Artagnan is never tired of insisting on the dishonesty and cowardice of the cardinal in personal and official relations, and on the venality he introduced into all the affairs of government. Hence he was universally hated, and all the prudence of the Prince of Cond6 was needed to prevent an outburst of popular fury. Courtilz is always too much inclined to represent the Fronde as the direct result of the vices of the prime minister. The great Condd was less favourably disposed to Mazarin who did his best to conciliate him. D'Artagnan even pretends to have over- heard and to reproduce the broken French of his servile flattery. I may add that during all the intrigues of the Fronde, the cardinalis represented 487</page><page sequence="14">Gatien de Courtilz as one who 'en nlatiere des ruses et de fourberie eit etd bien fache de le cdder a aucun.' His insolent distrust of his generals is dramatically brought out in an incident told of the siege of Gravelines. On the eve of a battle, the artillery was found to be lacking powder, and this was refused by the officer whose duty it was to supply it. Complaint was made to the Marechal de la Meillerie who swore to have the delinquent hanged in a trice. The latter calmly produced an order from Mazarin directing him to await the third or fourth demand for powder before supplying it, 'pour que les officiers sup4rieurs ne volent pas le roi.' The marshal, thus insulted, appealed to the Duc d'Orldans, who only laughed, asking 's'il ne savait pas que des qu'on etait d'une humeur, on se laissait aller aisement a croire des autres tout ce que l'on ressentait en soi.' The duke then related a string of similar orders by Son Excellence. All of which did not save the unhappy officer (though, to avoid scandal, the rumour was spread that he had committed suicide). D'Artagnan adds: 'Mais, si cela est, on avait bien voulu lui preter une corde et un clou pour se pendre au plancher d'une m6chante maison.' It is specially from personal relations with Mazarin that our hero draws his portrait. He observes that all favours were reserved for the creatures of the minister, who maintained a gambling den where it was essential to lose in order to win promotion. Those who failed in this respect were unable even to obtain the payment of their salaries. However, D'Artagnan and his compatriot Besmaus1 were at last taken into the personal service of the cardinal, who promised to look after their interests. They at first believed themselves at the top of fortune's wheel, but soon had to change their key, for 'si nous avions des bas nous n'avions pas de souliers,' remarks our hero. After he had fulfilled various delicate missions in which his life was constantly in danger, the cardinal offered him a company in the guards, but asked twenty thousand francs in return. In order to forestall objections, Mazarin caused this sum to be offered by four financiers. At the same time a young woman, more beautiful and wealthy than virtuous, pro- poses a large dowry with her hand. Our Gascon hoped to have the crowns pour ses beaux yeux, but he met his match. Whereupon, as he did not wish to be, as he says, 'de la grande confrdrie,' he was escorted to the door 'sans tambour et sans trompette.' D'Artagnan, like Courtilz' other heroes, is as ill-starred in serious courtship as he is successful in gallantry. Mazarin pressed the new lieutenant for 1 For Besmaus, see the Gazette de France, 23 Oct. 1646; for d'Artagnan, Chron. Hist.

WOODBRIDGE payment, and obliged him to have recourse to the financiers. Unhappily, he related to them, as a jest, the proposed marriage. Instead of money he received only the most cynical counsel. At last he obtained a loan from a man who shared his prejudices. The latter begged him not to specify the source of the money. D'Artagnan took the purse to his Eminence who sniffed at it, and invited him to do the same, asking if he detected any disagreeable smell. On his giving a negative answer, Mazarin assured him that all which came from the same source would be equally untainted. No need to be a Gascon to infer that the cardinal, as soon as he heard of the marriage proposal, had, with the best inten- tions, forbidden the financiers to lend the money. To him, observes d'Artagnan, the bitterest pill is poverty. On another occasion the cardinal communicates to his lieutenant his private views on politics. He was hoping to place one of his nieces on the throne of England, and sent d'Artagnan to get exact information concerning the true state of affairs. He was uncertain whether to negociate a marriage with the son of the protector or with Charles II. Finding his ambassador's sympathy all against Cromwell, he sets forth a doctrine in which the divine right of kings is treated with scant respect: I1 me dit...qu'il fallait que je susse que ce qui paraissait tirannique au commencement devenait juste dans la suite; que le temps rectifiait toutes choses, tellement qu'avec un peu de patience un usurpateur et meme un tiran devenait roi l6gitime; qu'il voulait donc que j'aimasse Cromwell si les Anglais l'aimaient, et que je le haisse s'ils le haissaient: que c'6tait la la pierre de touche dont il voulut que je me servisse pour connaitre s'il regnait sur eux legitimement, puisqu'aussi bien il ne d6pendait que de li de savoir si sa race lui succederait ou non, comme nos rois avaient succede a leurs peres.' D'Artagnan finds'cette decision merveilleuse et bien digne de lui,' but promises to do his best. Re- turning to France after a series of gallant adventures which seem to have very little relation to the object of his journey, he receives a large recompense for services rendered to the state. These few incidents, chosen among a thousand which throw the same light on Mazarin's character, must suffice. Needless to say that in the disgrace of Fouquet the attitude of the hero is always the same. It will be remembered that d'Artagnan was charged with the arrest of the minister of finance, and the Memoires give a dramatic account of the whole affair. Speaking of the papers left by the cardinal to implicate Fouquet, our hero remarks: 'On ne laissa pas de trouver cette accusa- tion etrange, non qu'elle ne fut veritable, mais parce qu'elle venait de 489 32 M. L. R. IX.</page><page sequence="16">Gatien de Courtilz lui. On n'6tait pas accoutume de voir un voleur en accuser un autre, a moins que d'etre entre les mains de la justice,...et, parmi tous les voleurs, il n'y en avait point qui le ffit en comparaison de lui (Mazarin).' Though most of the abuse in the Mdmoires is dedicated to the cardinal, no occasion is lost for a satiric portrait. Witness the following where the Count de Nogent' is introduced only to be thus branded: ' Ce comte 6tait un comte de nouvelle impression, et qui, de fort peu de chose qu'il etait naturellement, dtait devenu extrSmement riche. II avait passe quelque temps a la cour pour un bouffon....Il aimait le jeu au dela de tout ce que l'on saurait dire, et m8me il y avait perdu de l'argent.... I jurait et reniait pour ainsi dire, chreme et bapt8me, ce qui ~tonna tellement un jour un des freres du duc de Luynes qui jouait tres gros jeu contre lui, que pour ne le pas entendre blasph6mer davantage, il lui remit plus de cinquante mille 6cus qu'il lui gagnait. II lui dit... qu'il ne pouvait se mettre en colere si fort sans altdrer sa santd.... Cependant, ce grand blasph6mateur devint homme de bien sur la fin de ses jours, dont les capucins ne se trouverent pas mal quelque fois. Comme il etait voisin d'un de leurs couvents, quand il voyait un bon plat sur sa table, il le faisait oter par mortification, sans y vouloir toucher: il le leur envoyait en mlme temps, et leur faisait dire de le manger a son intention. Sa femme et ses enfants qui en eussent bien mang6 eux- mAmes, et qui n'etaient pas si devots que lui, en enrageaient bien souvent, mais il leur fallait prendre patience, parce qu'il se faisait ob6ir en d6pit qu'ils en eussent.' With such an eye this loyal servant of the king studied the ambitious nobles and upstarts of his time. Perhaps an undisputed canon of the writings of Courtilz can never be established. Lelong says he left manuscripts for forty unpublished volumes, and there is a natural tendency to ascribe to him this or that anonymous work of the same general type as those believed to be his. The only sound method seems to be to sift the evidence of contemporaries, and check it by the results of modern research. It is dangerous to draw any conclusions from style. Courtilz wrote rapidly, probably very much as he spoke, too often sacrificing clearness and even correctness to the hack's appetite for copy. One might almost say that any work which shows careful composition is to be put on the doubtful list. The author's one merit in style is in the racy and picturesque phrases with which he sprinkled his works. These form part of the adventurer's vocabulary, and fit admirably into the texture of the whole. They add realism to the scenes in which he deals with bluff soldiers or free-spoken mountebanks, 1 For him and his family, see Saint-Simon, Mgmoires, xIn, p. 564 (Grands Ecriv. ed.). 490</page><page sequence="17">BENJAMIN M. WOODBRIDGE and barb his satire of the great. He shows us princes and ministers off their guard, and then their speech corresponds to their actions; he describes their deeds in terms which give the colour of probability to the motives he imputes to them. The Mdmoires of Rochefort and of d'Artagnan are undoubtedly of greater interest than the other works of Courtilz as predecessors of the picaresque novel in France, although the satiric observation of the author is nowhere wanting, and all his writings show a conscious effort at rather sordid realism. It is interesting to remark that there is no trace of the influence of contemporary fiction in Courtilz' early work. Beginning with the romantic story of the Marquise de Fresne (1701), I find such influence here and there. This lady's adventures seem to owe something to the pirate novel popular at the time1; many of the adventures of the marquis D * * * might find a place in the Voyage en Espagne of the Countess d'Aulnoy, and finally, in the Mdmoires de B * *, the author has interpolated, according to the custom of romancers of those days, a fantastic novelette, which has no relation to the main plot, but relates the misadventures of a fair young Greek. But in general, we may accept for all the author's work the bluff remark of d'Artagnan that he was no reader of novels. I have tried to show that the source of his inspiration was quite different. Like the modern realists, Courtilz observed for himself. He retells stories heard in camp, and keeps much of the original flavour; he devoured satirical pamphlets, gazettes, memoirs and history, and gleaned something from them all. A more complete analysis than is possible here confirms this theory. Contemporaries of Courtilz who, like Bayle and Lenglet, judged his works severely, called them novels, meaning to express their profound contempt for this would-be historian. But the very frequency of these criticisms shows the necessity of putting readers on their guard-so convincing was his manner. Our author professed to share their scorn of romance, and often feigns to apologize for the rollicking adventures which his heroes recount in the midst of serious historical chronicling. His reason for publishing these manuscripts, he would have us believe, is the light they throw on certain obscure details of contemporary or recent events. History there is in his writings, and often too much of it, but so distorted and so intermingled with cleverly devised incident of the author's invention, that it is well nigh impossible to say what is fact and what romance. However it may be, to call these works novels, in the same sense as the greater part of the fiction of the time, 1 See my article in Mod. Lang. Publ., xxvI, 3. 32-2 491</page><page sequence="18">Gatten de Courtilz would be an entire misunderstanding of their bearing. Bayle himself drew from them, witness the article on Louis XIII in the Dictionary, and to-day serious historians of the age of Louis XIV declare that not everything in hiis writings is apocryphal. The difficulty is still to say precisely what is and what is not. I have tried to indicate a few of the tableaux d'epoque which may well claim some interest in the study of manners. None need now fear reproach in the term novelist. It is significant that those who would plead for Courtilz to-day call him a romancer. He is in some measure, say they, the father of historical fiction. In the foregoing study, I have tried to adumbrate his claim to another title, perhaps still more honourable. He is important in the history of the politico-picaresque novel, represented by the life of Gil Blas at the Spanish court, as also in that of the realistic novel. He professes to write contemporary history, though giving it a somewhat suspicious form. Hence to deceive his readers-and he did deceive them-he must keep close to reality. He states boldly that the effort to arouse interest in reality, as such, is an entirely legitimate one. In the preface to the Memoires de M. de la Fontaine (1698), he writes: 'Cette diversit6 d'incidents naturels, et tels qu'il en arrive tous les jours a la plupart des hommes, la brievete des recits...les lumieres qu'il [the supposed writer of the Memoires] donne sur la maniere dont les choses se passent a la Bastille: tout cela plaira sans doute beaucoup.' It will be objected that I am leaving out of account the earlier realistic writers in France, but the realism of Sorel, Scarron and Furetierel is vitiated by a conscious effort to ridicule the so-called idyllic novel of the time. The result is often a caricature of reality as well as of the sighing heroes of d'Urfe. There is no reason to suppose that Courtilz knew the works of any of his predecessors in realistic fiction, and the slight influence of the idyllic novel that can be discerned in him is entirely superficial. Writing as he did of men and events more or less familiar to his readers, he kept perforce within the limits of the probable, and the more accurate his observation, the greater his chance of success. He was then led through history to realism, and the spirit of the Fronde, imprinted on his childhood, has given a satiric tinge to his work that brings him into the line of picaresque fiction.
