Essai sur le role de la tradition mythologique dans l'Huma- nisme et dans l'art de la Renaissance, London, The Warburg Institute, 194o. Pp. 371; XLVII plates. The appearance of this book is a triumph of the spirit over the flesh. Closed by action of the Nazi authorities in Hamburg, the Warburg Library was transported to London through the courage and devotion of its staff and of the Warburg family, aided by British generosity. There it took shape again as the Warburg Institute, and entered upon its second phase as a center of learning and publication, con- tinuing the Vortrige, and the monographs on special subjects which had made it famous, with a fournal and a series of Warburg Institute Studies. Once more the Nazis have checked its course. The bulk of the library has had to seek safety away from London; and the circle of scholars who drew and distributed nourishment therefrom is broken up, some still hold- ing the fort in England, others being at work in the United States. Yet still their unity of purpose holds; still the 7fournal appears; and this, the latest of the Studies, has achieved publication. True, only a few copies have so far reached this country; and as the book was printed in Paris, and the edition is held there, it is likely to be some time before it is easy to obtain. But it is well worth watching and waiting for, partly because it co6rdinates and makes ac- cessible much of the learning that has inspired earlier work published under the Warburg aegis. More people read French with ease than they do German; and Professor Seznec has in a high degree the power of lucid arrangement, and of precise and elegant statement without the use of jargon, which is the mark of the best French scholarship. The book is, however, much more than a digest and a commen- tary; since at every turn, Professor Seznec brings a constructively critical eye to bear on earlier theories, clearing up confusions here, adding new material and new interpretations there, to make his book a posi- tive contribution to knowledge. Yet its value will not be fully realized unless it sends the reader back to the work of his forerunners in the field. Only so will the range and intensity of the scholarship which stems from Aby Warburg be fully understood. With Jacob Burckhardt as inspiration and pattern, Warburg, both in his writings and in the building up of his library, sought to prevent art history from being regarded as coincident with connoisseurship, a matter largely of attributions and dates, and to make it part of the study of the history of culture, with all the implied interrelations of man's various activities. That aim had developed out of his studies of the early Renaissance, in which the conflict be- tween individual freedom and authority was posed in various forms; and it was stimulated by a journey to the United States, where study of the Pueblo Indians emphasized for him the importance of the relation between religious forces and art. Such a program, however, was clearly beyond the capacity of any one man. The growth of the library owed much to the co6peration of his family, whose en- lightened enthusiasm made it financially possible; while around Warburg developed a group of younger scholars, to cultivate under his leadership the field he had envisaged, with the weapons he was provid- ing. Inevitably, however, that field had to be limited in scope, whatever the aims and methods pursued. So, in the first number of the Vortrdge, published in 1923, six years before the death of Aby Warburg, Dr. Fritz Saxl formulated the problem of the Warburg Library as "Die Frage nach Ausbreitung und Wesen des Einflusses der Antike auf die nachantiken Kul- turen"; and since then, under the direction and in- spiration of Dr. Saxl, on whose shoulders the mantle of Warburg has fitly fallen, that problem has been explored in the field of the arts, religion, natural science and medicine, and philosophy, always with regard to their mutual relations. Under Saxl, also, the library has continued to develop as an instrument to achieve its founder's aims, unique not only in the material it contains, but in the way that material is grouped. It is against such a background, and with the aid of such an inheritance that Professor Seznec has writ- ten. Broadly speaking, what he has set out to do is to trace through the Middle Ages and the period of the Renaissance, up to the beginning of the seven- teenth century, the survival and the evolution of the gods of classical antiquity, in the triple aspect con- ceived by classical antiquity itself: as historic figures who have become immortal, as the anthropomorphic embodiment of cosmic forces, and as the allegorical expression of moral and philosophic ideas. Naturally, such a course carries the reader into some curious and fantastic worlds. The conception of the gods as the historic predecessors of the human race found its most potent formulation in the Sacred History of Euhemerus, popularized by Ennius in Rome. Ac- cepted by the Early Christian Fathers, and exploited by them as a weapon against paganism (since it cuts at the roots of the idea of supernatural origin), later in the Middle Ages it became a means of making the gods respectable, and incorporating them, side by side with the great figures of Jewish history, into the history of the human race. Ultimately all this led (in Professor Seznec's own words) "to constitut- ing for them a title of nobility." So rulers through- out the Middle Ages were wont to trace the origins of their families back to the gods of antiquity. That the house of Burgundy should descend from Hercules is surprising enough; but more remarkable still is that Pope Alexander VI should claim as direct an- cestors Isis, Osiris, and Apis! The influence of the stars, however, called for a much more fundamental reconciliation of pagan and Christian ideas. The stars had come to be identified with certain of the gods of Greece and Rome, and primarily through the influence of Arab learning, with certain Egyptian and Babylonian deities. At the same time, astronomy and astrology had become hope- lessly confused, so that the movements of the heavens as physical phenomena became linked to the actions and influence on men of the gods of paganism. Mean- while, the Christian Church, for political reasons, had based its calendar upon that of the ancient world; had admitted into its teaching some astrological</page><page sequence="2">98 THE ART BULLETIN elements, such as the Star in the East; and in its pos- tulation of the existence of devils and demons, had paralleled the astrologers. The process of reconcilia- tion is an astonishing exercise of human ingenuity, displayed for example in acceptance of the astro- logical idea of the influence of the stars, but alleging that this influence was controlled and directed by the will of God. Ultimately humanist pride was to reject astrology as incompatible with the dignity of man; but Benvenuto Cellini, in the famous slance in the Colosseum, was to reveal that the influence of the old gods was not to be denied. Perhaps, however, the most complicated and fas- cinating series of episodes in the harmonizing of pagan survivals with Christian teaching, is the en- dowment of each of the gods with a suitable moral significance. The grosser episodes of life on Olympus were given an allegorical character, especially by the neo-Platonists; and so Saturn devouring his children exemplified "the vicissitudes of the soul in search of God." Pagan legends, again, were treated as fore- shadowing Christian truth; and so a tendency emerged to think in terms of a universal, eternally valid theism, which manifested itself under different names and shapes at different times. All these various efforts to put the new wine of Christianity into the old bottles of inherited belief and custom curiously parallel those of the nineteenth century to find a modus vivendi between scientific discoveries and Christian belief; and the parallel holds good also in the passion of both the Middle Ages and the ninteenth century for encyclopedias, in which apparent reconciliation of old and new could be achieved by formulation and arrangement, if not by integration. The history thus traced of the gods as ideas is sufficiently bizarre; but the expression of these ideas in pictorial and plastic form had even more fantastic episodes. When, as in Carolingian times, a plastic tradition survived, and artists could work from ver- sions of classic figures (even at fourth or fifth hand), the gods in painting and sculpture kept some relation to their Greek and Roman prototypes. But when we come to the illustrations of an astronomical-astro- logical treatise written by Michael Scot between 1243 and 1250 for the Emperor Frederick II, their forms undergo a sea-change into something peculiarly rich and strange. Discovery of how and why is due to Dr. Saxl's acumen and learning, in tracing Michael Scot's gods back through Islamic manuscripts to Baby- lonian sources. In this way the divinities of Greece and Rome take on eastern shapes and emblems, Jupiter becoming a clerk or a jurist, Saturn a warrior, Mercury a bishop with a book, and so on; and in these new forms they exercise wide influence, which explains, for instance, how Jupiter on the Campanile at Florence comes to be represented in a monk's robe, holding a chalice in one hand, and a cross in the other. Even more extraordinary variations and concep- tions were due to artists working wholly from literary descriptions, such as the Imagini deorum of Albricus. Incidentally, Dr. Seznec does a very neat and de- cisive piece of work in clarifying the distinction be- tween the long treatise Albrici philosophi liber ymagi- num deorum which dates from the thirteenth century, and was used by Petrarch, and the fifteenth century abridgment De deorum imaginibus libellus which was much more widely known and used. Such treatises, either because of their author's imagination, or mis- readings or misunderstandings of his text, were a fruitful source of the appearance of various strange disguises for the gods. Curiously enough, northern artists perpetuated more sober and classic types, while the Italians, perhaps owing to eastern influ- ence, tended more towards the extravagant and bizarre. It is not surprising, therefore, that when in the fifteenth century the gods began to be restored to their classic shapes (what Dr. Seznec calls "the re-integration of the gods"), northern artists, includ- ing Diirer, played a considerable part in the process. But literary influences were not to be denied. There was singularly little turning to classic texts for information about the gods; and the chief sources, such as Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum and the works of Gyraldi, Conti, and Cartari which succeeded it in the sixteenth century, were mainly the gathering to- gether of material from medieval sources. These treatises in turn tended in successive editions to take the form of manuals in dictionary form, easily consulted by artists; and so the gods as restored and re-integrated in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies kept a host of emblems and attributes, and re- tained a historical or moral significance, which had accrued to them long after ancient Greece and Rome had ceased to exist. In this connection, Professor Seznec's chapters dealing with the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly valuable. Herein he traces how enthusiasm for antiquity, and Christianity as expressed at the Council of Trent, found reconciliation in symbolic interpretation of the gods; to such an extent that classic mythology found a place of honor in Jesuit instruction, as a convenient vehicle for teaching both religion and morals. Such is the scope and aim of a remarkable book. Criticism in detail would call for the fabulous stand- ard of the reviewers of the North American Review, who "read all the works the author had read, and verified all his citations." As it is, apart from a number of misprints (one of which converts a former curator of the Metropolitan Museum into the firm of "Bryson et Burrough"), the only two sources of im- portance unused by the author which I have noted are the writings of Matthew Paris and the drawings of Inigo Jones. I have always wanted to know whence the Diana to whom Brutus is sacrificing in the Historia major got the horns on her head and the wings on her feet; and I am still ignorant. As regards Inigo Jones, Dr. Seznec apparently does not know the admirable selection of his drawings pub- lished by the Walpole Society in England, with an introduction and notes by C. F. Bell. Knowledge of this would not have altered his conclusions; but it might perhaps have given one section of his book a little more substance. Much more important than such details is the rela- tion of the book to the work of the art historian. One great service it does is to stress the continuity in human thought and activity, and to show how arbitrary are certain current divisions in time. All historians ought to remember Samuel Butler's defi- nition of a hen as an egg's method of producing an-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 99 other egg. So, we might with some reason regard the Middle Ages as the way Antiquity took to pro- duce the Renaissance. To quote Dr. Seznec speak- ing of fifteenth-century Italy, "the gods themselves were not brought to life again; for they had never disappeared from the memory and from the imagina- tion of men." But with equal clarity the book emphasizes that though the elements that make up human thoughts and actions may persist, the pattern they make changes, to the extent sometimes of pro- ducing a difference in kind. The gods in seventeenth- century Europe served very different ends from those in fifth-century Greece. W. G. CONSTABLE Boston Museum of Fine Arts</page></plain_text>
