<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rohonas and Spotted Lions The Historical and Cultural Occurrence of the Jaguar, Panthera onca, among the Native Tribes of the American Southwest Steve Pavlik most people the very word "jaguar" conjures up visions of a magnificent spotted cat stalking through the dense semitropical or tropical rainforests of Brazil, Costa Rica, or perhaps Mexico. Few would associate this animal with the forests, woodlands, or especially the deserts of the American Southwest. Yet this land, too, is jaguar country. In reality, the historic range of the jaguar, Panthera onca, extended well into the United States. Jaguars have been documented throughout the state of Arizona as far north as the Grand Canyon. In all, at least eighty-four jaguars are known from Arizona alone since 1848. Jaguars have also been recorded in Southern California, New Mexico, Texas, and perhaps even Colorado.' Unfortunately, jaguars, like all other large predators, were killed whenever and wherever they appeared. Never plentiful, the jaguars native to the American Southwest were soon extirpated. Although some animals continued to enter the country from the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora, the great cat was not listed under the En- 3 157 dangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. Between 1970 and 1996, many jaguars were reportedly sighted, especially in Arizona, but only two were "official," that is, they were killed and their skins collected. Then in 1996 two different jaguars were brought to bay by lion hounds belong- ing to two separate hunting parties two hundred miles apart in Arizona. The first cat was photographed; the second cat was photographed and</page><page sequence="2">videotaped. Both were then given their freedom. The jaguar had returned to the American Southwest.2 The appearances of the two jaguars galvanized the conservation community to action. Lawsuits and threatened lawsuits resulted in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) belatedly listing the jaguar under the ESA in 1997. Meanwhile, the states of Arizona and New Mexico, along with a dozen other federal, state, county, and local agencies, de- veloped a Jaguar Conservation Agreement with the FWS. Initially put together to head off the listing of the jaguar, the coalition remained to- gether after the cat was listed. The purpose of this group-a partner- ship of various government, public, and private interests calling itself the Jaguar Conservation Team (JCT)-is to develop and implement conservation practices beneficial to the jaguar. One task of the JCT has been to learn as much as possible about the jaguar in its Southwestern range. What type of habitat, for exam- ple, does the jaguar require? What prey does it most favor? What other unique factors and needs exist? The close relationship that exists between the jaguar and the na- tive people of Mesoamerica and South America has long been studied and is well documented. For the native people living in these cultural regions, the jaguar was widely revered as a warrior and a god.3 Yet little is known about the relationship between the cat and tribal people north of the Mexican border. Did a similar relationship exist? The pur- pose of this essay is to explore this question, to document the historic and contemporary occurrence of the jaguar among the tribes of the American Southwest, and in doing so, add new knowledge to what we know about the spotted cat. The following section will deal with the occurrence of the jaguar in prehistoric Native American cultures prior to 1540.4 Subsequent sections will document the occurrence and role of the jaguar among the Pueblos, Southern Athabaskans, Northern Pimans, and other tribes of the American Southwest. In a closing sec- tion, I will present an argument in support of studying the role of the jaguar among these various peoples. Br ~ THE JAGUAR IN THE '^ PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST o u George Gaylord Simpson determined that there were only three groups 158 3 of large Pleistocene felines in North America: pumas (mountain lions), m jaguars, and the so-called American lion. This last species, Panthera atrox, Simpson believes to be more accurately a giant jaguar, an extinct species related to but clearly distinct from Panthera onca.5 However, the pub- a lished literature leads to considerable confusion as to the exact identity of what might be called the true jaguar. Panthera atrox, an animal perhaps two or three times the size of its</page><page sequence="3">smaller cousin, coexisted with and was probably hunted by Paleo- Indians. This fact is strongly suggested by finds at Ventana Cave in southern Arizona and at Jaguar Cave in Idaho where remains of the giant jaguar were found in association with human activity.6 The Ventana Cave specimen consisted of only a few tooth fragments and was found in a volcanic ash layer along with the fossil remains of a giant ground sloth. Also present in this layer were a number of stone implements, including one Folsom-style projectile point. This site was occupied successively for about ten thousand years by the Cochise cul- ture, the Hohokam, and ultimately by the historic Pimans. Although Emil Haury refers to this animal as an "extinct jaguar," he seems some- what unsure of its exact identity. The tooth fragments found, he writes, were "clearly representative of a very large felid ... and its close corre- spondence in form to the comparable feature in Felis (Panthera) atrox." When describing the habitat of this animal, however, he clearly seems to be referring to Panthera onca, its living counterpart. "The jaguar," he writes, "must be regarded as an animal which also might associate itself with a plains or desert fauna, as it does today in northern Mexico, al- though in the Neotropical region it is more characteristically a jungle animal."7 Considering the extremely small amount of bone left to ex- amine, it appears that Haury is simply offering his best educated guess as to this cat's true identity. It is quite possible that the Ventana Cave specimen is, in fact, Panthera onca. If so, this would be the earliest record of an association between man and jaguar in the American Southwest. The jaguar species Panthera onca is recorded from the earliest Pleistocene deposits, so the fossil record of this feline species spans ap- proximately 1.5 million years. Pleistocene jaguars, which were slightly larger than the largest of today's living jaguars, have been recorded throughout the United States, including sites in Washington, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Florida.8 In the Craighead Caverns in Tennessee, the remains of at least two jaguars were found along with a set of per- fectly preserved jaguar footprints.9 It is believed that the northern and eastern ranges of the jaguar were gradually restricted by a sequence of glacial-interglacial shifts. In the Southwest Pleistocene, jaguar remains &gt; have been recorded from sites in New Mexico and Texas.'0 No definite fossil record exists linking jaguars and man during the Pleistocene. V The earliest indication of jaguars and Paleo-Indians coexisting on the same landscape is found at Schulze Cave in Edwards County, v Texas. Walter Dalquest reports that at this location the remains of both s 159 jaguar and man, dating back approximately four to eleven thousand years, were found together in two separate layers of the cave. Although the bones were actually mixed together, no evidence exists that they were purposely buried that way.'" Skeletal remains of a large feline ten- tatively identified as a jaguar were also found at another prehistoric site on the San Pedro River near Redington, Arizona.12</page><page sequence="4">One definite prehistoric site that documents the jaguar in the Southwest is Pottery Mound. This site, a collection of ruins attributed to the Anasazi culture, is located in central New Mexico in the valley of the Puerco River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande. Pottery Mound, which is dated A.D. 1300 to 1475, is unusual among Anasazi sites in that it has produced evidence of Mexican influence, specifically as to pottery types, clay bells, and the presence of parrot and macaw feathers. The most distinguishing characteristic of Pottery Mound is its magnificent kiva art, paintings that cover the walls of many of the site's seventeen ceremonial rooms. One of the most spectacular paint- ings is of a jaguar. This animal is well drawn and unmistakable, light brown in color with dark spots. It is depicted reaching for a bird, pos- sibly an eagle. Frank C. Hibbon sees this image as possibly being a re- flection of the eagle-jaguar cult of Mexico. Other figures in the same fresco are of mountain lions and seated human figures. Many of these figures, including the jaguar, wear quivers with arrows. Hibbon notes that among the Anasazi the mountain lion was usually linked with the war society, and these figures could represent a council of war.'3 This association between the mountain lion and the jaguar, not only as warriors but also as hunters, continues with the descendants of the Anasazi-the historic Pueblo Indians. At least one other excellent paint- ing of a jaguar was found at the Pottery Mound site. Unfortunately, this painting was partially destroyed by pot hunters prior to archaeo- logical excavation.14 Another long-tailed spotted feline appears in a smoke-blackened cave on the Pajarito Plateau in northern New Mexico. Schaafsma makes the point that "although mountain lion cubs are spotted, it seems un- likely that juveniles would be selected as metaphors of power."'5 In all likelihood then, this figure is also a jaguar. The rock art from this plateau dates between A.D. 1325 and 1550. Two other impressive prehistoric sites that include jaguar rock art can be found near El Paso, Texas. The first of these is located at Fort Hancock and is attributed to the Jornada branch of the Mogollan cul- &gt; ture, A.D. 450 to 1400. This site includes a rock shelter called Jaguar Cave, with walls covered with pictographs of various animals. These paintings are in white and include what has been identified as a three- N foot-long jaguar wearing a collar. Numerous other animals and kachi- nas are painted on this same panel, including an eight-foot-long plumed 160 3 serpent also depicted wearing a collar. A series of parallel dots begin at the serpent's collar and continue on to form the end of the jaguar's tail. ? The painting in this shelter and the various motifs reflect an obvious z Mesoamerican influence. A pictograph of a jaguar wearing a collar, for example, can be found in the Temple of Tlahuiscal-Pantecuhtli in Tula, Mexico. It is speculated that the plumed serpent might represent the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl.'6</page><page sequence="5">A second jaguar rock art site is located at Hueco Tanks State Park, Texas. This site, the Cave of the Masks, is also attributed to the Jornado culture and contains a yellow and red painting of a spotted jaguar wearing a curving, conical "shaman's cap." Also found in this rock shelter is a painting of what has been called a "kachina blanket," and a number of beautifully painted mask designs. Again, the motifs and the style utilized are considered to provide evidence of possible Mesoamerican influence.17 THE PUEBLOS The Pueblo Indians, descendants of the Anasazi and Mogollan peoples, are generally divided into two groups: the Eastern Pueblos who live along the Rio Grande River in New Mexico; and the Western Pueblos, the Hopis of Arizona and the Acoma, Laguna, and Zuni tribes of west central New Mexico. In her definitive study of Pueblo religion, Elsie Clews Parson wrote of a rohona, an "unidentified, perhaps mythic animal" that exists in the stories of the various Keres-speaking Pueblo groups.'8 Leslie A. White took up the challenge of identifying this creature and concluded "that it is a real animal and, furthermore, that it is a jaguar." Although among some Pueblos the rohona does appear to be another species-a weasel, mountain lion, coyote, or wolf-White found sufficient evident to support his theory. Most Pueblos, he found, identified this animal as being a large cat. Since mountain lions are common in Pueblo country and play an important role in Pueblo culture, they are clearly identified and can be ruled out as being the rohona. The wildcat or bobcat can probably be eliminated from consideration for the same reason. This leaves the lynx, a historic inhabitant of the northern limits of Pueblo country, and the jaguar, which, as noted, is already documented in the Anasazi and Mogollan record.19 At the Pueblo of Santa Ana, White was told that the rohona was a "big cat with spots" and, along with the moun- tain lion, is talked of during ceremonies held by the tribe's hunting so- ciety. In this role, these two cats represent spirit hunters who bestow &gt; their power on the tribal hunters. These spirit hunters are associated with directions, and the jaguar is considered the spirit hunter of the west.20 A similar tradition exists at the Pueblo of Zia.21 At the ancient Hopi village of Awatovi and at the nearby Kawaika-a site, the so-called Jeddito sites, there are several kiva murals depicting 161 elongated quadrupeds with short legs, long horizontal tails, and point- ed ears and snouts. Watson Smith discusses the possibility that these animals might be the fabled rohona. He goes on to speculate that Keresan immigrants from the Eastern Pueblos might have brought knowledge of the jaguar to their Hopi relatives. In the end, Smith makes the doubt- ful determination that these animals are most likely mountain lions</page><page sequence="6">since they resemble the likeness of mountain lion paintings found at Zuni.22 The several reproductions he offers of the Jeddito creatures show spotted animals that are feline in appearance. One of the Kawaika-a paintings is especially interesting. It shows only the rear half of an ani- mal, which is white with black spots and a black-banded tail passing through a shield with an eagle and star motif on it. The immediate impression one has of this painting is that it is a cheetah. I am confident it is a jaguar.23 One other painting found at Awatori deserves men- tion. This is of a blue and white feline-like animal with a bear-like foot also passing through a shield. The white portion of the figure is spotted like a jaguar. Polly Schaafsma speculates that this figure might be a jaguar.24 With regard to the mountain lion paintings at Zuni, which probably are mountain lions, it must be noted that the Zunis did pos- sess knowledge of jaguars. In 1540, Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado visited Zuni and recorded the presence of both "tigers" and "leopards" in the area. One or both of these animals were certainly jaguars.25 The Hopis also possessed knowledge of the jaguar. A photograph taken in 1908 shows the full stretched-out skin of a jaguar killed by hunters from Second Mesa. The author of the book in which this pic- ture appears, M. W. Billingsley, states that he took the photograph as the Hopis were dressing out the skin. He further noted that the skin showed no arrow marks and that the Indians claimed to have killed the animal "by hand."26 If true, this might reflect a ceremonial killing in which the animal was smothered with corn pollen. This jaguar might be the same animal reportedly killed in 1907 or 1908 "by a group of Indians" four miles south of the rim of the Grand Canyon.27 On June 28, 1998, I attended a kachina dance held at the Hopi village of Shungopavi on Second Mesa. One of the Siyangephoya kachinas, or left-handed kachinas as they are commonly called in En- glish, wore a magnificent arrow quiver made of jaguar skin. I was able to approach within a few feet of this dancer to make a clear identifi- cation of the pelt. The rosette-patterned markings were unmistakably &gt; jaguar. Another Siyangephoya wore a quiver of some type of cloth material made to represent the skin of a spotted cat. The other two Siyangephoya dancers wore quivers made of bobcat skin. Barton Wright describes Siyangephoya as one of the hunter kachinas.28 I was not able u to identify the source of the jaguar pelt, though it probably came to the 162 5 dancer through trade from Mexico. Possibly this skin was from the jaguar killed by Hopi hunters at the turn of the century. 0 I TTHE SOUTHERN ATHABASCANS The southern Athabascans are generally divided into two large and very distinct tribal entities: the Navajos and the Apaches. Both groups</page><page sequence="7">possess considerable traditional knowledge or experience regarding the jaguar. The largest Indian tribe in the United States, the Navajo inhabit a region that extends over an area of some twenty-five thousand square miles in northeastern Arizona, a part of northwestern New Mexico, and a small section of southeastern Utah. The Navajos are a product of the coming together of two distinct peoples, the Athabascans and the Pueblos. Consequently, the jaguar knowledge possessed by the Navajos might be a product of their Pueblo heritage, especially since Pueblo elements form the core of Navajo religion and ceremonialism. Since the Navajos are the most anthropologically studied tribe in the United States, a considerable amount of jaguar information has been documented. The identification of various members of the feline family in Navajo ethnozoology is often difficult. In their ethnographic dictio- nary, the Franciscan Fathers list Navajo terms for five different cats: the wildcat, lynx, mountain lion, puma, and leopard.29 Similarities in the terms for puma and leopard suggest that the Navajo saw a close rela- tionship between the two animals or that possibly, as I believe, they were the same animal, namely, the jaguar, considered within differ- ent contexts. Three other cats listed by the Franciscans, the canyon lynx, grass lynx, and meadow lynx, were thought to be mythical. The Franciscans, foremost of whom was the eminent scholar of Navajo reli- gion, Father Berard Haile, also provided "sacred names," or ceremonial names, for the mountain lion, wildcat, and puma, the latter of which is also referred to as a "meadow wildcat."30 Again, I believe this last ani- mal to be a jaguar. To further complicate matters, Navajo collaborators provided other anthropologists, and thus the anthropological litera- ture, with numerous other names to describe various members of the feline family. Two of these names, tiger and spotted lion, most certain- ly refer to the jaguar. The story of Navajo creation is one of a progression of "emer- gences" from one world to the next. In his work on the Upward Mov- ing and Emergence Way ceremony recorded in 1908, Haile describes &gt; the Seventh World of the Navajo people as being the home of the Cat People or Feline People-the Mountain Lion, the Wildcat, the Puma, and the Wildcat of the Canyons.3' Again, since Mountain Lion and Puma are listed as separate entities, Puma must be a jaguar or, more accurately, Jaguar. The Cat People were anthropomorphic beings or 3 163 deities who could talk, behaved like men, and possessed supernatural powers. In time, many of these beings transformed into the animal forms we recognize today. Thus Puma, the anthropomorphic being, became jaguar the animal. One other indication that Puma is in fact Jaguar, is that in the Emergence story he lives in a "spotted house," quite possibly a symbolic reference to the spotted skin of the jaguar.32</page><page sequence="8">Haile goes on to describe the creation of two other pumas, one from the south and the second from the north, who along with two wildcats stand in protection of the house of First Man. At one point in the story, the Wolf People, and then later the Mountain Lion, Kit Fox, and Badger People, launch an attack on the house of First Man, shoot- ing arrows of turquoise, white shell, abalone, and jet that Puma and Wildcat catch and shoot back at their enemies. Later Puma and Wildcat of the North also attack First Man.33 Haile also mentioned Puma (or Jaguar) in his narrative of the Creation story leading to the first Beadway ceremony. Near the end of this ceremony, a "Wildcat" sandpainting was made. This sandpainting consisted of eight figures, including two of Mountain Lion, two of wolves, two of badgers, one of a gray wildcat, and one of "Spotted Puma."34 Again, the inference is strong that Spotted Puma is Jaguar. In a narrative of the Beadway story, Gladys A. Reichard uses the name Spotted Lion instead of Puma. She goes on to identify Spotted Lion as being a "Mexican jaguar."35 She reproduces three sandpaintings from Beadway, each of which includes two Spotted Lions dancing. In the first, called "The Exchange of Quivers," one Spotted Lion, in the company of Wolf, is shown holding a dark bow and wearing a blue quiver made of lynx skin. The second Spotted Lion, in the company of Mountain Lion, is shown holding a dark bow and wearing a quiver that Reichard describes as being made of wolverine skin.36 In the second sandpainting, titled the same, Mountain Lion, Wolf, and the two Spotted Lions are joined in their dance by two Badgers, two Lynx, and two Bobcats, but only Wolf and Mountain Lion have bows and quivers. In the third sandpainting, "The Hunting Animals with Corn Packs," the same ten participants are dancing, but Wolf and Mountain Lion have given up their bows and quivers and all are wear- ing packs on their backs laden with corn.37 This sandpainting is espe- cially interesting in that it shows Spotted Lion, or Jaguar, in a role other than that of being a hunter or warrior. In all three sandpaintings, the figures of Spotted Lion are black with white spots. Perhaps this is &gt; meant to represent the black or melanistic phase of the jaguar, a color phase in which the rosette markings show through the dominant black coat of the animal. Another, perhaps more likely possibility is that it represents no more than the creativity of the sandpainter, since most of the other figures also lack natural color depiction.38 164 s The Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe, New Mexico, has in its collection two other Beadway sandpaintings ? that are very similar to the ones described above but are of an earlier provenance. In the first of these paintings, "Exchange of Quivers," two black Spotted Lions are shown with two Mountain Lions, one yellow, the other white. This painting is a 1925 copy of a 1904 original by medicine men Speech Man and Old Man's Son. The documentation</page><page sequence="9">accompanying this painting identifies the Spotted Lion as being a jaguar and that he was taught the Beadway by his brother Scavenger. The second Wheelwright Beadway painting is titled "Hunting Animals with Cornpacks." This 1929 sandpainting by Husteen Ayonandeel shows two black Spotted Lions in the company of two Mountain Lions and two other figures who are presumably Wildcat or Lynx. Again, as in the previously mentioned Beadway sandpaintings, the Spotted Lions are black with white spots.39 In the Navajo Hunter tradition as recorded by Karl Luckert, ref- erence is made to "Tiger," who along with Wolf, Lion, and Bobcat are hunters of deer and who were "present from the beginning."40 Luckert believes that his informant's Tiger was exactly that, the Asian tiger. He theorizes that this animal was added to the story as its existence be- came known to the Navajo. This seems unlikely since a second Navajo informant of his also makes reference to Tiger as being one of the lead- ers of the Hunter people.4' It seems much more probable that the Navajos adopted the word for tiger from the Spanish and Mexicans with whom they had contact for more than three hundred years and who used tigre in reference to the jaguar. In addition, a third Luckert collaborator provided the anthropologist with another version of the Navajo Hunter tradition in which the great animal hunters were iden- tified as Wolf, Mountain Lion, Wildcats, and "spotted cats."42 Again, Luckert, as he did with the term "tiger," does not seem to consider the possibility that the spotted cats his informant told him of could be jaguars. Instead, he inexplicably concluded that these animals must be cougars, despite the fact that the mountain lion, which Navajos most commonly refer to as being a cougar, already had been listed as a dif- ferent entity by his informant. In the end, it seems clear that Luckert's tigers and spotted cats are, as in the case of Haile's Pumas, truly jaguars. Jaguars are also mentioned in a number of other Navajo sources. In the original story of the Eagle Chant, a ceremony closely related to the previously discussed Beadway, reference is made to Spotted Lion who, along with his fellow hunters Mountain Lion, Wolf, and Lynx, is one of the animal helpers to the great Navajo deity Monster Slayer.43 Reference to the jaguar is also made by Leland C. Wyman and Flora L. Bailey in describing the paraphernalia used by Navajo medicine men or singers who practice the Evilway ceremony, a ritual used to prevent diseases and misfortune caused by ghosts. Among the ceremonial items they list are two shoulder bands or bandoliers made of "spotted big 2 165 wildcat skin," which they say is taken from a wildcat or jaguar, and wristlets made of "spotted skin." They conclude by noting that "the skin of a weasel may be used if jaguar is unavailable."44 It should be noted that no jaguar has ever been documented in Navajo country. Several explanations exist as to their appearance in tribal traditions, and these will be discussed in the concluding section.</page><page sequence="10">The Apaches are divided into a number of bands that live mostly in the east central mountains of Arizona, but also in parts of New Mexico and Texas. With regard to the Apaches, Spencer F Baird states that they called the jaguar tutinquille.45 Unfortunately, he does not say which of the many Apache groups he is referring to. Since the only North American specimen he examined came from Texas, it is possible he received his information from the Lipan Apaches who live in that state. I showed this word to several White Mountain Apaches in Arizona; they were not familiar with it and doubted it was Apache. The jaguar appears a number of times in the historical literature dealing with the Apache tribes. John C. Cremony, an officer in the Second Calvary of the California Volunteers stationed at Fort Sumner, the Bosque Redondo Reservation, on the Pecos River, 1862 to 1868, wrote that he frequently hunted with the Apaches incarcerated there and that "even jaguars were by no means uncommon."46 Another inter- esting jaguar-related reference is found in Grenville Goodwin and Keith H. Basso, who provide a narrative of an Apache scout describing the actions of a renegade who possessed "jaguar power"-the ability to immobilize his intended victim with fright, then fight his enemy with unusual ferocity. After killing a man, this criminal reportedly boasted, "I made jaguar medicine on him and grabbed him like a jaguar and killed him. I was like a jaguar."47 At least five jaguars have been killed in this century on or near the Fort Apache Reservation in Arizona. In 1907, a jaguar was report- edly killed in the "Mogollon Mountains," probably along the Mogollon Rim, near Fort Apache.48 In 1924, another was taken as a livestock killer near Cibeque.49 In the winter of 1956-57, a jaguar skull was found near the White River.50 In 1963, another was killed by a hunter when it responded to a predator call. This animal, a female, was killed near Reservation Lake, less than two miles from the eastern border of the reservation.51 The next year, a male jaguar was killed by a govern- ment trapper near the confluence of the Black and White Rivers. This u cat was put on display for several days at Fort Apache and drew large &gt; crowds of people who came to see it.52 The site where this animal was killed is now known to the Apaches as Jaguar Point and is less than fifty miles from where the previous jaguar was killed.53 One can only specu- late that if these two animals had not been killed, they might have lo- cated each other and, in doing so, have added a new chapter to the his- 166 3 tory of the jaguar in the American Southwest. 0 NORTHERN PIMANS z The Northern Pimans of southern Arizona are composed of a number of related groups, most notably the River Pima or Gilenos, the Papago or Tohono O'odham, and the Sand Papago or Hia-ch-ed O'odham.54</page><page sequence="11">These groups were closely tied, linguistically and often socially, with the Southern Pimans or Tepehuans of Mexico. Since this paper con- cerns itself with jaguar traditions north of the Mexican border, readers interested in this matter are advised to turn to the works of Campbell W. Pennington.55 It should be noted, however, that historically neither jaguars nor the Pimans have concerned themselves much about inter- national borders. The cats have continued to cross back and forth, as has the exchange of traditions and ideas concerning the jaguar among the Piman people. The Tohono O'odam know the jaguar in their own language as ooshad, the spotted one. He is also known as s-o'ohi mavid, the spotted cougar or mountain lion. In addition, he is also known by the Spanish name tigre.56 A reference to "Tiger," an obvious personification of a jaguar figure, is found in the Tohono O'odham story of the Origin of the Flute.57 Joe Joachim, a tribal traditionist, states that his people have al- ways had deep respect for the jaguar and seldom hunted them. If a man killed a jaguar he risked contacting a sickness and would have to under- go an all-day ceremony. In this ceremony the medicine man or shaman used jaguar parts, including the skin and tail. Usually medicine men did not display their jaguar skins.58 Amadeo M. Rea, who has written a definitive study on folk mam- malogy among the Northern Pimans, states that all of the old Pima and Papago men he spoke with knew of the ooshad. One of his sources stated, "They're supposed to be in the Sierra Estrella. It's a dangerous animal." Rea also noted that the jaguar was considered "fair game" and was eaten when killed by the Pimans.59 Considering the location of the Northern Pimans-the heart of what might be considered jaguar country in southern Arizona, there are surprisingly few historical records of the great cat among these people. Padre Ignz Pfefferhorn, who worked with the Sobaipuri, a sub- group of the Papagos with a reputation for being fierce warriors, re- ported that this tribe used jaguar skin in making quivers. "Tiger skin," he writes, "is prized above all because of its beauty; therefore, he who &gt; has slain a tiger is proud and happy." He goes on the describe the pro- " cess by which the head skin and cape of the jaguar was also used by the Sobaipuri to make headdresses or war bonnets: ? War bonnets are worn in engagement to give the wearers 3 167 a horrible appearance and to frighten the enemy. These bonnets are made of the heads of the most terrible wild animals, which have been skinned with the greatest care and caution to prevent damage. The skins are stuffed, dried, and dressed so ingeniously that the face of the animal completely retains its high-spirited, natural appearance.</page><page sequence="12">The head is the front part of the bonnet and covers the Indian's forehead, representing with great naturalness the terrible appearance of a tiger, a bear, or some other animal with pointed ears, gaping jaws, and terrible teeth. The back part of the bonnet covering the warrior's head to his ears is made of other parts of the animal's skin, decorated all around with many-colored feathers hanging from it. Fi- nally, the bonnet is topped with a luxuriant feather plume.60 There are also a number of more recent jaguar reports coming from Tohono O'odham country. In the 1920s, Herbert Brown stated that he had "seen several hides brought in by the Papagos of animals (jaguars) killed in the mountains southwest of Tucson."61 In 1933, a rancher reportedly killed a jaguar in the Sierra Estrella Mountains on tribal land.62 In another report, by C. C. Presnall, dated October 9, 1945, a jaguar was seen either in the Baboquivari, Coyote, or perhaps the Roskruge Mountains, again on the Tohono O'odham reservation.63 The second of the 1996 jaguars referred to at the beginning of this essay was treed by hounds belonging to lion hunter Jack Childs in the Baboquivari Mountains less than one mile from the reservation border. This jaguar was later tracked by Childs onto tribal land.64 OTHER TRIBES In the Mojave deer songs, Jaguar appears as the younger of two broth- ers, Hatekule, while Mountain Lion, Numeta, is the older brother. The two brothers possess supernatural powers. They can fly through the heavens, travel the underworld, and transform themselves into other forms, including that of man. Jaguar is credited with having created deer. He did this by thrusting his hand into the earth until he found suitable clay, then shaping the clay into the forms of two deer-a buck and a doe. In this way, deer came into existence. After creating the deer, Jaguar taught the Walapai and the Yavapai how to hunt them.65 &gt; As in the case of the Navajo stories discussed earlier, a language problem exists in that some words are better understood than translat- A ed. In the Mojave songs, younger brother is often referred to as Wolf, at other times the names of the two brothers are reversed, and on at least one occasion both brothers are "mountain lions." In studying this 168 3 matter, Alfred L. Kroeber seems convinced that one brother is a jaguar. He concludes that "He (the jaguar) was certainly a traditional animal ? to most Mohave; very few of them could ever have seen one, even in the old time, but he was not imaginary."66 Another Yuman tribe, the northeastern Yavapai of Arizona, also possessed knowledge of an animal other than a mountain lion or wild- cat that was undoubtedly a jaguar. They referred to this animal as a</page><page sequence="13">"tiger" and described it as being larger than a wildcat with longer hair and orange buff in color.67 Two Yuman-speaking tribes of southern California were also fa- miliar with the jaguar. The Dieguefios reportedly called the jaguar, which inhabited the Cayamaca Mountains near San Diego, Hut-te-kul, or the Big Spotted Lion.68 The Cahuilla Indians of the Coachella Valley and San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains called the jaguar tukwut. While they used this term in a rather vague way to describe a number of animals, their description of a "large cat with yellow-brown skin marked with spots and having a long tail" seems to leave little doubt as to the identity of this feline. To the Cahuilla, the jaguar was reportedly "well known" in the mountains bordering the desert before 1860. Tribal members followed jaguar trails to uncover and eat their kills. They also hunted and killed the cat, presenting its hide as a gift at tribal celebrations.69 Another interesting reference to the jaguar in California is made by Richard Perry, who states that an Indian from an unidentified tribe was attacked and killed by a jaguar while hunting deer-he was "camouflaged with a deer's antlers" at the time-near Palm Springs. This event reportedly took place about 1865.70 The Comanches of Texas called the jaguar naboro'ya-rohco. Ernest Thompson Seton noted that, among this tribe, the jaguar was "not in- frequently met"7' and that its skin was a favorite material for bow and arrow quivers.72 During her captivity among the Comanches in the 1830s, Dolly Webster reported "near attacks" from an animal she de- scribed as a "leopard cat."73 The Yaquis of southern Arizona, a tribe that immigrated to the United States from Mexico around 1900, have a strong jaguar tradi- tion. The Yaquis call the jaguar topol. Undoubtedly the jaguar has a long tradition in Yaqui culture south of the border. One town in Sonora is named Topolovampo.74 Some of this tradition remains with Yaquis living in the United States. A Yaqui deer song, for example, speaks of an "enchanted spotted mountain lion," that may or may not be a jaguar.75 Felipe Molina states that pascola dancers once wore jaguar skins.76 In addition, there are Yaqui stories that refer to the existence of "tigers" and, in one case, a human folk hero named Topol.77 During the tribal Easter ceremony following the sighting of Child's t jaguar in 1996, a Yaqui pascola dancer reportedly wore a jaguar mask. ? When interviewed for a Tucson television station, this dancer stated that u he was dancing to honor the return of the jaguar. Such remains the power ? 169 and influence of the jaguar among the native people of the Southwest.78 CLOSING THOUGHTS z I have attempted to document the historical and cultural occurrences, and those occurrences that are most likely jaguar, among the tribes of</page><page sequence="14">the American Southwest. I believe that the evidence is solid that the jaguar has been known to most tribes from the earliest prehistoric pe- riod and that that knowledge continues through to many present-day tribal peoples. While nowhere in its U.S. range does the jaguar rank in status with the bear, mountain lion, or coyote, the spotted cat remains nonetheless an important figure. The type of evidence I have presented, especially rock art and oral tradition, is generally ignored because it does not constitute "hard scientific fact." I have talked to several wildlife biologists about the Navajo Spotted Lion stories. All of them categorically state that any Navajo story regarding a spotted lion is likely about a lion or a cub that is spotted. Their argument is simple, namely, that there is no historical evidence of jaguars ever inhabiting Navajo country. This argument, however, is a flawed one. Any reading of the Navajo stories clearly shows that Spotted Lion is a partner, a coequal, to the Mountain Lion. The two are most certainly not the same animal. To discount the Navajo stories simply due to the absence of scientific proof, i.e., a dead jaguar, is to dismiss several possibilities that might explain its presence. First, the Spotted Lion might be a product of the Pueblo side of Navajo heri- tage. Second, the highly mobile Navajo might have come in contact with the cat at the periphery of their country, at the Grand Canyon, Zuni, or perhaps even during their Bosque Redondo incarceration, 1864 to 1868. Lastly, as I prefer to believe, the stories themselves might be true: they speak of an earlier time when man, animals, and gods lived as one family. This last option most certainly would not withstand scien- tific scrutiny, but then perhaps it does not have to. Admittedly, most rock art interpretation is highly speculative. I can also understand how the thought of magical jaguars flying through the heavens would raise the eyebrows of most scientists. I do believe, however, that behind these images is hidden real knowledge. In sum, I believe that native knowledge has much to contribute to our under- standing of the jaguar. Yet I know of no wildlife biologist studying jaguars who has taken the time to sit down and talk to, say, a Tohono O'odham or Yaqui elder. I think that it is important for those people working to preserve the jaguar to establish a relationship with the Tohono O'odham whose lands border Sonora, Mexico, where breed- ing populations of jaguars still exist.79 Once while I was traveling the reservation, I asked a tribal member if she knew anything about jaguars. 170 3 "Yes," she replied, "the people here see them all the time." It would be easy to simply dismiss such a comment, but to do so would be a mis- take. Certainly someone continues to see jaguars on the vast Tohono O'odham reservation. To know more about these animals requires a sincere commitment on the part of non-Indians to keep an open mind to the possibilities that exist. In addition, there are cultural barriers that must be overcome. The</page><page sequence="15">JCT has developed a protocol to deal with reported jaguar sightings. In the case of a category 1 sighting, a response team is established to go to the scene and attempt to capture the animal. In such a situation, the jaguar would be anesthetized, blood samples taken, other tests con- ducted, and the animal radio collared so that the Arizona Department of Game and Fish can monitor its movements.80 One Tohono O'odham elder I spoke to strongly objected to this plan. Whatever valuable data might be acquired, handling a jaguar in such a manner completely vio- lates the traditional tribal view as to how we should deal with a fellow animal person. Clearly, any effort on the part of Game and Fish to cap- ture and process a jaguar on tribal land will require a large measure of mutual respect, trust, and understanding. Both scientists and wildlife officials would benefit from establish- ing a working relationship with tribal people. Most important, the jaguar will benefit. Only by working together can we assure the future for this magnificent animal. POSTSCRIPT On December 9, 2001, a remote camera operated by Jack Childs pho- tographed a new jaguar approximately five miles north of the Mexican border in southern Arizona.8' The exact location of this sighting is being withheld due to concerns over the cat's safety. The fact that this Jaguar was photographed by one of fewer than ten cameras set out for this purpose, along a vast, largely mountainous area of nearly three hundred miles, is encouraging. Some see this as an indication that the occurrence of jaguars in the American Southwest might be more com- mon than initially thought. NOTES A version of this paper was originally presented to the Jaguar Conservation Team meeting, Animas, New Mexico, January 22, 1998.

It is especially difficult to draw a line between where the Anasazi period ends and the Pueblo begins. I will use 1540, the year of the first serious Spanish foray into the Southwest. 5 George Gaylord Simpson, "Large Pleistocene Felines of North America," American Museum Novitates, no. 1136 (August 11, 1941): 1. 6 Emil W.
