Pp. 465; 5 color illus., 100 black-and-white illus. Many of those who travel to Conques find the reliquary statue of St. Foy unexpectedly captivating, powerful, and unsettling. Assuming a similar impact on medieval beholders of this image, Beate Fricke sets out to locate the sources of this power and to situate the reliquary statue within the history of the veneration of images in the medieval West. In her ambitious, thought-provoking, insightful, and sometimes frustrating book, Fricke takes the reliquary statue of St. Fides (the form of the saint's name she prefers) as the touchstone for her argument that saints' statues played a crucial role in the revival of freestanding sculpture in the High Middle Ages. A number of interwoven topics run through the book, beginning with mul tiple aspects of sight and perception. Another is the relationship of idolatry to the veneration of saints, especially in three-dimensional sculptural representations so apparently similar to idols. Materiality as sign of immateriality forms another thread: the gold or silver that encases reliquaries is for Fricke a crucial factor in the validation of three-dimensional sculpture, precisely because of the effect of immateriality that these highly reflective physical materials have on beholders. Aesthetics enters as well, with a juxtaposition of the bricolage that Fricke finds characteristic of medieval treasure objects with the harmonious beauty of classical art that still shapes the contemporary appreciation of figurai art. Finally, there is an oscillation in this book between the general and the particular, that is, between the large topic of the reintroduction of three-dimensional sculpture and the chief example, the reliquary statue of St. Fides; evidence oscillates as well, between the multiple discourses that Fricke collectively calls cultural history and the spe cific documents associated with the saint's cult—primarily the Liber miraculorum sancte Fidis (hereafter, LM), the first two books of which were written by Bernard of Angers. The result is that the book itself seems at times to be a bricolage. In her foreword Fricke sets out her questions and goals: she wants to under stand how medieval Christians saw and thought about images of sacred figures, especially saints, and how they worked through the problems involved in creating, accepting, and appropriately venerating them. This brief foreword is following by four chapters and a summarizing afterword. The shortest of the four—chapter 1, "Images in Christian Cult"—makes the point that polyvalence, which Fricke sees as characteristic of Christian art, developed</page><page sequence="2">224 Reviews as the forms and motifs of ancient art were reused with new meanings. As a result, "a difference between outer form and immanent content began to develop" ( 19). The body part or "speaking" reliquaries that began to appear in the ninth century exemplify this difference: the shaped reliquary neither evokes nor completes a human form but, by housing a relic, serves as a vehicle for enabling the saint's presence. Fricke adopts Gerhard Wolf's definition of cult image, which includes "a specific public or private reception of the image," which has "two bodies" (35). Texts attach the images to a cult center and report the origins, martyrdom, transla tion, and continuing miracles of the saint. Following this definition, the reliquary statue of St. Fides would be "the oldest preserved, cultically venerated saint's image in western art outside of Rome" (35). A very long chapter 2, "Veneration of Images and the ' Cultura veterum deo rum ' in the West," opens with a brief and uncritical summary of Fides' passion and translation narratives. This leads to the reliquary statue, which, if its present form coincides with its ninth-century form, is quite anomalous in an age of reliquar ies shaped like body parts, not full figures. Isolating what restorer Jean Taralon identified as the elements of the present statue that can be dated to the late ninth century, Fricke puts forward the hypothesis that the original figure could have been a bust reliquary, converted only about a hundred years later into a full figure. Ber nard of Angers reports that the statue had been "de integro renovata" ("reshaped anew"), not long before his first visit to Conques, which admits the possibility of change from a bust reliquary into an enthroned full figure. Fricke argues that this would explain the awkward proportions of the present figure, though it is difficult to understand why "reshaping anew" would not have addressed this issue. The same chapter also sketches the history of the monastery at Conques, before taking up the Western attitude toward images; Fricke points out that West ern theology interested itself not in the image but in the idol, "its alter ego and its adversary" (63). Tertullian claimed that demons empower idols, Augustine denounced idol worship, and Isidore of Seville explained idols euhemeristically, but there was no sustained Western discourse on the nature of images or on the nature of the relationship between copy and original "in the moment of observ ing and venerating it" (72). Fricke attempts to tease out such ideas in an excursus on the first two of the Ten Commandments, specifically the direct address, "I am the Lord, your God," which she understands to mean, "Only for God is it allowed and permissible to step before the eye of the faithful and enter into a dialogue; no demon or other god dares to endanger this bond" (72), a bond that is most specifically threatened when a three-dimensional figure stands frontally in a face to-face encounter with the beholder. Here, rather typically, Fricke moves her argu ment forward in the absence of primary sources by taking a more exegetical or meditative stance herself. Next she gathers narratives of the destruction of idols:</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 225 demons required intact images, so damaged idols lost their power, whereas Chris tian images vigorously defended themselves. Still, animated by powers whether good or evil, idols and Christian images could be strangely alike. Extended analy sis of five miniatures in the Stuttgart Psalter then establishes differences between idol worship and worship of the Christian God, importantly, that idol worship was one-sided, since pagan sacrifice establishes neither a dialogue nor a gift exchange. Idols also occur in miniatures accompanying Prudentius's Psychomachia, where the first battle takes place between Fides, the personification of Christian faith, and Cultura veterum deorum, or, as she was called in later manuscripts, Idolatria. Fricke emphasizes the powerlessness and impassivity of the idol, which stands on its pedestal unscathed and therefore lifeless as Fides brutally kills her enemy. Starting in the eleventh century, however, idols no longer stand by dumbly but are shown as reduced to fragments, usually in visual narratives of the saints. A brief deflection of the reader's attention to the postmedieval centuries for a discussion of the impact of disciplinary boundaries and national histories on the study of monumental sculpture illustrates the author's tendency to juxtapose rather than establish a clear through line. This section, too short to be comprehensive, is followed by a lengthy overview of the Western attitude toward images through 825, a date when a gathering of theologians called to Paris by Louis the Pious (a colloquy and definitely not a synod, according to Thomas Noble)1 reached conclu sions about a number of important issues, among them images, recorded in what has come to be called the Libellus Synodalis. For Fricke such texts were accom panied by an impulse to make and display in churches large crucifixes with three dimensional bodies of Christ. Fricke now moves to trace in more detail the phases she identifies in the revival of monumental sculpture, starting early in the ninth century with large crucifixes with sculptural bodies of Christ. The materiality and prominence of these objects, the beginning of the revival of monumental sculp ture, has been neglected. In her view the story of the bronze serpent in Numbers, along with its typology and exegesis, played a decisive role in legitimizing these crucifixes. Fricke amasses a great deal of evidence for the existence of monumen tal metal-clad crucifixes starting in France in the early ninth century. Their size probably derived from their intended location: in the middle of the church, near the altar, either hanging or on a column, and visible to a large public in the church space. Turning to reliquaries, Fricke compares their efficacy with that of the cru cifix: both function through sight, but whereas the crucifix gained its authenticity from its form, the arm or bust reliquary does so from the relic. The saint's radiant "art-body" refers to his or her resurrection body, and while it rests on the altar dur ing mass on the saint's feast day, "earthly presence and heavenly representation fuse" (155). These images of saints were also carried in processions. The saints,</page><page sequence="4">226 Reviews usually martyred in the region, were believed to heal, to defend the rights of the poor and imprisoned, to protect monastic property, and to acquire gifts. Especially in the Auvergne, Fricke suggests that they replaced pagan gods, specifically the allegorical "virtue-divinities" of the Romans. Chapter 3, "Dead Masks—Animated Gazes," revolves around the face of the reliquary statue of St. Fides. The reuse of a late antique portrait head of a secular male, probably a nobleman or ruler, to serve as the head of a long-dead, thirteen year-old female saint, provides evidence for Fricke's argument that the reliquary statue was not meant to recreate the appearance of the saint but to refer to, even to be seen as, the new body the saint had earned through martyrdom, the resur rection body. To grasp this form of perception, a beholder of the reliquary statue must reject the idea of art as mimesis. It is through the inlaid enamel eyes, Fricke argues, that the statue appears "animate." The presence of the relic inside the statue makes it possible for the beholder in this world to imagine and to see not the statue but the saint in the next world, and to connect with her true presence. Interpreting Bernard of Angers's descriptions, Fricke sees deliberate emphasis on the face and on the exchange of gazes between cult image and believer, and she finds this par alleled in the narratives of St. Fides's miracles. However, in supporting her argu ment that the true believer perceives the heavenly body of the saint with examples from Bernard's text, Fricke seems to minimize the great variety in reports of the saint's appearance and actions in visions and dreams. In general in her interpreta tions, she prefers to situate Bernard's text within large contexts, often providing new insights. But this approach tends to undervalue the intensely local character of the miracle stories and the impact of local actors, for example, of the monks in promoting the cult of their newly acquired saint. In her choices of miracle narra tives to analyze, Fricke favors the high over the low, the heavenly body of the saint over her graphic actions of poking sticks in eyes and thrusting fingers into stinking mouths. Bernard, however, draws on all of the senses—not just sight—in his nar ratives about this intensely physical and practical world. The radiance of gold dominates the sight of the reliquary statue, and all of the symbolism of gold carries over to the statue: "The many-layeredness of the reflected light engenders in the perception of the observer a physical presence and a living impression of such a kind that the statue appears to be ensouled and the power of its shining appears to radiate out from itself and not only indicated from outside" (222). To support her argument that the source of this radiance was understood to be Fides' virtuousness, Fricke turns to the extensive description of Guibert's vision in 1.1 of the LM, each element of which Bernard interprets alle gorically. Blurring the distinction between Guibert and Bernard, Fricke creates the impression that each beholder of the reliquary statue had access to this highly intellectualized interpretation.</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 227 A long meditation on the concept of identity considers the question of how the beholder identifies the sight of the reliquary statue with the saint when it can not be a matter of physical resemblance. Ranging from the Roman concept of persona—mask, role, character, but not individual—to the danger involved in giving a saint's statue a beautiful face, Fricke returns to the idea that the reli quary statue functions as a pointer to the heavenly body. A close reading of the mid-eleventh-century gravestone of Abbot Isarnus in Marseilles, along with a roughly contemporary ivory relief of Bishop Sigebert of Minden and a miniature from the Bamberg Sacramentary, leads Fricke to the conclusion that there was a concern with representing the boundary between this world and the next in such a way that the beholder has the possibility of seeing through it to the saint in the next world, of perceiving transcendence in a visio spiritualis, or of sharing a visio intellectualis. The miniatures presented from a manuscript of Flaymo of Auxerre's commentary on Ezekiel further this line of argument, which is difficult to untangle because both figure calls in the text and folio numbers in the captions are incorrect. Chapter 4 takes up Schatzgestalten, treasure forms, or treasure art: in effect, art that ended up in treasuries due to some combination of the precious materials used during the manufacturing process and, often, precious contents in the form of relics. Treasure pieces are heterogeneous in both form and function, as well as subject to change in their component parts. A key term here is bricolage, though having identified it as Lévi-Strauss 's, Fricke does not draw on his ideas about what it connotes. The bricolage of treasure art results, Fricke claims, from gift exchange, a concept she takes from Marcel Mauss. Many of the miracle stories in the LM fall into the category of gift exchange. For Fricke it is important that such gifts graced the reliquary statue itself, contributing to its bricolage nature, but here she fails to address Bernard's claim that the saint collected them to be melted down for an altar frontal (1.17). For Fricke the changing appearance of the statue due to addi tions and subtractions attests to Fides's miracle-working ability, successful gift exchange, and the power and liveness of the image. Further, "only treasure-pieces with anthropomorphic form" (261) could stimulate the gift exchanges that enable them to acquire this meaning. The bricolage nature of treasure objects also ren dered them susceptible to "re-fragmentation" when their possessors needed funds. The period around 1000 is the first high point in the history of treasure art as a composite of precious substances, illustrated by the donations of Henry II, which have inscriptions explicitly indicating the gift exchange involved. Treasure objects do not conceal their nature as bricolage but rather "allow their seams and fractures to become explicit bearers of meaning" (303). Fricke calls them "open works," a term borrowed from Umberto Eco (opera aperta). This principle of composition extends far beyond gift exchange with cult images, to many works of medieval treasury art as well as to large-scale objects. In keeping</page><page sequence="6">228 Reviews with the reliquary statue's openness of form, its meaning is also multiple and yields to medieval principles of biblical exegesis. The frequently used material of gold exemplifies the possibilities of interpretation, which are multiple but certainly not unbounded. The beholder participates in the construction of meaning of an open work, thus, the aesthetics of bricolage are crucial for understanding the connection between the reliquary statue of St. Fides and its beholders, and that connection is the key to the revival of monumental three-dimensional sculpture in the West. The many important ideas in Fricke's book are neither easy to access nor to relate to one another, not least because of a striking level of carelessness in proof reading. Perseverance will, nonetheless, reward the reader with much food for thought and new possibilities for filling a major gap in medieval art history. Pamela Sheingorn City University of New York NOTES 1. Thomas F. X. Noble, Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009), 339. Noble's magisterial overview of this material stands now as the last word on this subject. What is clear from his highly accessible summaries of many relevant texts is that ninth-century authors who wrote about religious art were most interested in defending the cult of the cross (stimulated by the liturgical development of the Adoratio crucis), and less, but still signifi cantly, interested in defending relics. They allowed but did not require images, by which they primar ily meant wall paintings, and all three could be "adored," so long as it was understood that "God is owed one form of adoration and all other persons and things are owed different kinds of adoration, veneration, respect, and honor."
