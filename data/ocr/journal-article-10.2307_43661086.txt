Lange Kent State University Introduction As contemporary Ethiopia successfully continues the awesome task of unifying its peoples on foundations devoid of racism and ethnic snobbery, it is more than appropriate that ethnological attention be turned to the deepseated cultural bonds between peoples throughout Ethiopia, peoples forced by internal contradictions within their former societies to severely strain these and other bonds through war and exploitation. Despite the violent inter-ethnic confrontations of Ethiopia's feudal past and despite the former racist ethnic and religious stratification relegating the cultures and religions of oppressed nationalities, particularly in the south, to an inferior status, the historical evidence clearly shows that the cultural integration of northern and southern Ethiopia is neither a recent phenomenon nor one restricted to superficial ties among royalty. The high degree to which the cultural forms and content of the two culture areas are integrated necessarily reflects a long history of peaceful relations during which the oral traditions, religious ideology and mythology of the one were shared with, occasionally adopted, and generally transmitted to the future genera- tions of the other. Selected for their striking testimony of this widespread cultural integ- ration within Highlands Ethiopia are four classic traditions of the šeka and and Kafa peoples of southwestern Ethiopia. With the exception of the Kafa Minģiločči epic none of these traditions has been previously published. They not only provide new insights into the intriguing history of two rela- tively unknown African peoples, but also lucidly portray both the Kafa and Šeka as an integral, if not the key, link between the Ethiopian cultures of the north and those of the south. The traditions are not to be considered mere charming legends. They are much more the national epics of the Seka and Kafa peoples. Each refers to the beginning of a new way of life. The Šeka Godļji epic and the Kafa Miníjiločči tradition both relate the national version of the establishment of Bušašo-related dynastic rules in the Kafa Highlands during the second half of the 16th century. Inasmuch as all avail- able evidence indicates that the Bušašo dynasties throughout southern Ethiopia were strongly linked to northern Ethiopia, it is not surprising to find a a host of similarities between these Šeka-Kafa traditions and those of parti- cularly the Amhara and Tigre peoples in northern Ethiopia. The other two traditions relate the establishment of new religious forms within the Kafa Highlands toward the end of the 18th century. The Šeka BaččoCCi and AdamoCCi cults and the Kafa Gumbaččino priesthood express much of the essence of the traditional religions developed among both peoples. An analysis of their ideological content shows that neither developed in a cultural vacuum isolated from other Ethiopian religions. In addition to providing evidence for the wide-ranging cultural integra- tion in Highlands Ethiopia, this analysis also aspires to vindicate the use of oral traditions as historical documents. One rather durable obstacle to the full use of oral traditions as bonafide sources of not just a people's beliefs but of their history is the pervasive and perhaps ethnocentric tendency to consider the written word more reflective of historical objecti- 1</page><page sequence="2">2 vity than the spoken one. The arbitrary division between written and unwritten language often attributing to oral traditions a status akin to mythology, while elevating written ones to levels approaching hiśtor- ical treatises fails to appreciate the degree of subjectivity in any written source (let alone those composed centuries ago by Ethiopian Chrisian monks) and the historical precipitate present in nearly every orally transmitted ^tradition. An attempt to crystallize such a pre- cipitate from the symbolic complex of a people's oral traditions attracts a growing number of scholars recognizing this task as methodologically similar to that any historian faces in deciding which contents of a given manuscript reflect historical objectivity and which reveal a collective subjectivity. To expect Ethiopian Christian manuscripts, for instance, to be devoid of mythological content so evident in Ethio- pian oral traditions, would be to continually encounter the disappoint- ment of the 17th century German scholar, Ludolphus, who upon reading a 15th century Ethiopian Christian manuscript f^und its contents to be "so stupid and silly that he could hardly find patience to read them" (Budge 1 935 : xvi i ) . In order to advance anthropological science, however, we must not only find the patience to study any and all tradi- tions but also gain the understanding that ^ven the most heavily over- drawn symbolisms in written and oral sources are indeed meaningful in a historical sense. The cross-cultural analysis of several Ethiopian traditions contained in this exposition certainly supports this con- tention. The methodology employed within this analysis is rather straight- forward. Traditional ideological manifestations of Ethiopian peoples, whether in the form of legends, myths, folktales, religious dogma or oral traditions, are scrutinized for either compositional or elemental similarities to Kafa and Šeka epics. The contrast between a composi- tional and elemental similarity as used in this analysis should be conceived as analogous to what some structural linguists refer to as the deep structure and surface structure of a language. In other words, a tradition orally transmitted from generation to generation retains a certain holistic structural core (the composite) necessary for sustaining its essential message even though many of its less bonded parts (elements) are frequently interchanged with those of other traditions. Comparing the whole (composite) and parts (elements) of tradition A of one people to that of tradition B of another people- especially in such culture areas as Ethiopia which have experienced millenia of Volkerwanderungen-helps determine the degree and kind of cultural integration between the two peoples. Compositional and elemental similarities are assumed to be directly proportional to cultural integration, with compositional similarities indicative of much stronger and deeper cultural ties than are elemental ones. This analysis also involves considerable skepticism of what is glibly known as "independent invention", and a rejection of unadulterated diffusion. Each Ethiopian culture stamped ideas originating elsewhere and accepted by its members with its own peculiar cultural mark; examination of the essential contents and not merely the overlaying marks, however, reveals cultural bonds often submerged through historic repression. At least one notable shortcoming of this study should be mentioned at the onset: nearly no oral or written traditions of Ethiopian Islamic cultures are presented. The reason for their absence is hardly lack of cultural ties between the peoples of the Kafa highlands and Islamic cultural forces (indeed there seems to have been more than mere seminal Islamic influence among at least the Seka), but is much more due to the unfortunate and general lack of documented and published Ethiopian Islamic folklore and traditions. A comprehensive study of Islamic Ethiopia on an equal plane with the accumulated evidence on Christian Ethiopia would certainly provide a more balanced and accurate view of cultural integration within Highlands Ethiopia.</page><page sequence="3">3 KAFA MIN0ILOČČI EPIC Around the middle of the 16th century immigrants from northern Ethiopia coalescing into an influential social and political unit headed by a certain Mingi ločči usurped power in Kafa from members of the Matto clan. This historic transfer of power eventually leading to the estab- lishment of the Mingo-Bušašo dynasty constitutes the theme for one of Kafa' s most celebrated traditions, the Mingiločči epic. The four variations collected during our 1972-73 fieldwork1 within the Kafa highlands add some notable elements to those previously recorded. For saving his mother from murder by his accursed brother, Jakamo, Mindscho was declared to be the ruler over Kafa by his mother . As they came to the river Guma, the mother became ill and gave Mindscho the symbols of authority, a golden ring and a golden arm bracelet. After burying his mother Mindscho washed himself in the Guma river. While washing he inadvertently allowed the ring and the bracelet to fall into the water. Slaves of the ruler in Kafa from the Matto clan apprehended Mindscho while he was searching for these golden items. Mindscho told all to Matto. Matto had some medicine thrown into the river. After this he found the bracelet and the golden ring in the belly of a fish. Upon taking these the Matto became king and Mindscho was made his slave. He had to haul the grass for the males of Matto. Many years later after Matto had a hen killed for his afternoon meal and he walked outside, he heard a voice tell him that whoever ate the head of the hen will become king. Shocked, he quickly returned to his house and demanded from his wife the head of the hen. Mindscho had already eaten the head. Matto called the coun- cillors of state together and explained the strange incident to them. They decided that Mindscho should become the king. Mindscho was called for, given the bracelet and ring and made the king. He also swore an oath with Matto to allow him to be the Shoderasha. Matto swore an oath never to attempt to usurp the power of Mindscho... (Bieber 1923:^87-88; Cecchi 1886:^88-89; Vol. Il) Mango and Matto came out of the hole together. Mango came out carrying a rope on his shoulder and Matto came out with cows. The people on the earth made Matto king. His servant, Mingo, became king. A voice from the sky told Matto while he was on the latrine that whoever ate the head of a rooster called Balo would become the next king. The voice was the angel of the sky-god. Mingo always received the head as his regular diet and therefore he received it at this time also. Matto gave the kingdom to Mingo without a fight, (the kafa-raša, Matto clan elder; Kafa-Kafa; 6/73.) Matto was on the toilet with a tapeworm and with medicine for it when he heard the cock cry out that the next person eating the head of the chicken would become the king. Some say that the angels said this through the rooster. Mingo ate the head and became king. Matto gave way to the will of yero. Min^o made Matto a councillor of state. (the gučče-raša, Gu££e- Amaro clan elder; Kafa-Bonga; 5/73.) Mingili was at a river with a bible in his hand. A woman came to the river to get water. Mingili hid himself as she approached. After she got the water and was on the way back, Mingili returned to the river. Then a voice came from the sky saying: 'Whoever eats the head of the chicken first will become the next king!' The Matto were king at the time of this happening and the Mingo brought two heaps of grass for them daily. Mingili was the servant of the Matto-tato. As he brought one heap of grass</page><page sequence="4">4 to the house for the king, he heard this voice. He asked the wife of the king to first give him the head of the chicken and then he could give her the grass. The king had a tapeworm at the moment and was taking medicine [koso] for It. Therefore, he was late to his meal. He normally ate before Minģo. After learning that Mingili had eaten the head of the chicken he called Mingili to him and gave him a great cloth. He told him to sit in his place and asked him not to do any harm to his clan or to his sons in the future. (Gebre-Mariam, Amaro clan elder; Kafa-Yofo; 1/73) As the Matto-tato, who had drunk Koso to kill the tapeworm, was going to defecate, he heard a drum beating and a voice from the sky telling him that the person eating the head of the next rooster killed in his house will be the next king. The king cleared his throat and spit on the floor. This is the way he announced that he wished to eat. He discovered that Midģili had already eaten the head. He tried to kill the Midģili by putting him in a hut with a leopard. Mldgill spent the night there and killed the leopard.2 The Matto king then gave his kingdom to M i dg Ili. The Matto-tato died of smallpox after this. (the fa-rasa, řa'o clan elder; Šeka-Ge£a; 11/72) 1. Compositional Similarities The most remarkable and far-reaching compositional similarity to the traditional Šeka-Kafa account of Mindļo ascension to power is the Tigre- Amhara tradition of the alleged restoration of the "Solomonic" dynasty fol- lowing the Zague-Yekuno Amlak transition of power in the late 13th century. Historic Ethiopian documents, such as the Be1 ela Nagast , the Kebra Nagast and the Debra Li banos hagiography of Takla Haymanot, contain recorded versions of Yekuno Amlak' s overthrow of the Zague rulers. Their basic similarity to the Seka-Kafa tradition regarding Mingo's ascension to power as conceived by contemporary Kafa and Šeka elders is not only striking, but also clearly indicative of strong and ancient cultural bonds between the cultures of northern and southwestern Ethiopia. The father of Yekuno Amlak ("by the will of God"), Tasfa lyasus [identified as a "vagabond"], met lyasus Mo'a, who informed him that his son would rule; Tasfa lyasus went to the house of a rich man and spent the night there; he slept with one of the female servants of the house and told her he had given her gold; the pregnant servant went out to the fields to gather firewood; while doing so her womb opened and she bore a son; the mother threw the child into the field and returned to the house with the firewood; the mistress of the rich man asked her what had happened with that which was in her womb; the maid- servant said she had nothing; the mistress sent slaves with torches to search for the child; they found it at a place called Felagua; the child grew and received the name of Yekuno Amlak after kO days; he became a pupil of a disciple of lyasus Mo'a; the disciple was standing praying at the rich man's house one day as a rooster crowed out that whoever ate its head would become the next king; the disciple thought it was the voice of the Holy Ghost; the monk told the rich man this; he told the maid-servant to prepare the rooster well; she threw out the head; Yekuno Amlak found it and ate it; the rich man searched for it but could not find it; the rich man wished to kill the boy but his wife hindered him saying it was not right in the eyes of the Lord to commit such an act; Yekuno Amlak and lyasus Mo'a made a bargain that if Yekuno Amlak got his kingdom, then lyasus Mo'a would be given that which his heart desired; the king put Yekuno Amlak on top of a mountain called Malot Geshen Amba; Yekuno Amlak descended the Amba by interlacing the skin of a monkey3; he went to the house of lyasus Mo'a at Debra</page><page sequence="5">5 Damo and there he stayed for 20 years; after becoming king he gave one-third of the kingdom to lyasus Mo'a; lyasus Mo'a blessed him. (Conti Rossini 1921 : 279-31*0 4 There was a certain king who had risen up from among the kings of Zague and who was called Z'elmaknun and the kingdom of him and of those kings who reigned with him [lasted] three hundred and seventy- two years and concerning him and their kingdom arose the following reasons for his speaking. Now when God was angry with the house of David, He gave the kingdom of David unto these kings of Zague. And it came to pass that whilst this man Z'elmaknun was living thus, his cock rose up and crowed in the house, saying, 'Whosoever shall eat me shall become king forever; and [this] kingdom shall not pass away to any other man.' In this manner did the cock continue to crow for a space of three months, but none knew the interpretation of the cockcrow, neither among the nobles of Z'elmaknun, nor among his friends the priests, nor among those who were skilled in the knowledge of books, nor any man except the king himself. Then fear laid hold upon Z'elmaknun. And whilst he was in this state of fear our father Takla Haymanot came... And the king Z'elmaknun made known to him the matter of the cockcrow, and [asked for] the interpretation of his words, and he said, 'I was lying on my couch at midnight, and I was awakened from my slumber suddenly by hearing the crowing of a cock, and the words of his interpreta- tion thereof, but the others did not hear it. '0 my father, inform me completely concerning this matter, for I am wholly unable to interpret this thing by myself. What is the occasion for these words? And what will be the result of the utterance of the speech of the bird?' Now when the king Z'elmaknun hath [thus] spoken to the saint' with humble words, our father Takla Haymanot answered and said unto him, 'The matter concerning which thou hast asked me is a difficult one, so difficult indeed is it that there hath never been any like unto it before, and there shall never by any like unto it in times to come.' Now when he had held his peace for a space of an hour, and had remained in a state of great astonishment and wonder over the matter, he opened his mouth and said unto him, according to the words of the voice of the bird, which said, 'Whosoever slayeth me, the kingdom shall not depart from his house, and he shall reign for ever.' Then straighway the king Z'elmaknun rose up and went into his palace, and he called to a certain handmaiden whose name was Dal i bawi t, now she was the most honourable of all his hand- maidens, and he said unto her, 'Rise up, seize that cock, and kill him so that I may eat him quickly, and let not any other woman draw nigh to that cock, but prepare him privily, and let him not be seen by anyone, for the mystery which belongeth to him is a hidden one.' And when the king had said these words unto her, and she put inside him a great many sweet-scented herbs so as to make the bird smell sweet, and she threw the head of the cock into the fire [-place] as she was in the habit of doing [with the head of birds]. Now at that time there lived a certain youth whose name was Yakuno Amlak, who was chosen from his mother's womb to inherit the throne of David, his father... Now this youth continued in the service of king Z'elmaknun, and there fell to him the work of cutting grass for the king's mules, and sometimes it was his duty to feed the horses with grain, and sometimes to carry sword and spear and to go before the king. And this youth Yakuno Amlak found the head of the cock which the woman had left by the fire- place and he took it and ate, and it filled his belly, and it made him an exalted person and so mighty a man that he was superior</page><page sequence="6">6 to every other man of might, and It made his face to shine like the light of the sun, and his majesty filled ail the other servants of the king with awe, and all the people feared him and they marvelled at him, and they loved him exceedingly, and they placed him in their hearts, and they recognized that the grace of God was upon him, and they said, 'What is the thing which hath come upon this young man?1 Let us return once more to the subject of this history. Now when the king Z'elmaknun did not find the head of the cock among the food in the dish, he was greatly disturbed, and he was said, and was much moved, and he wept exceedingly, and he walked round and round on the ground. Then he rose up and departed with his soldiers to our father Takla Haymanot, and when they had met together they made the company to withdraw from their presence as they had done before. And when they were left by themselves the king told our father Takla Haymanot about the head of the cock which was missing from the dish saying, 'l did as thou didst command me, and as thou didst counsel me, but the woman threw away the head of the cock, and I was unable to find it where she had thrown it, because she thought that I should not eat the head of the cock. Then was i greatly astonished and dismayed, and behold I have now come to tell thee the cause of the destruction of the cock's head, 0 my father; help thou me so far as thou art able to do, and give thou me counsel. For in thee there is the power of God, and thy power hath might and it shall have dominion even as said James, the Apostle, the brother of our Lord... Now when our father Takla Haymanot had prayed his prayer, an angel came unto him from heaven, and the angel of God said unto him, 'Do not pray on behalf of this king of Zague, for the multitude of days, even the space of three hundred and seventy-two years, which I have given him, is sufficient for him, and he is un- worthy, saith the Lord therefore cease thou to pray for him; and moreover, this day have I brought the kingdom of God to Yakuno Amlak, the son of David to his seed for ever... And when the angel of God had said these things unto him, he went up into heaven, and our father Takla Haymanot, of honourable name, having heard these words from the mouth of the angel, annointed Yakuno Amlak king, and set him off to the war. (Budge 1906:3^6-52) A rooster crowed in the house of the Zague ruler, Elmaknun, saying that whoever ate its head would rule for eternity and inherit the kingdom of David; it crowed this for three months; no one of the wise men of the court of the king was able to inter- pret the message of the rooster; the king went to Takla Haymanot for an explanation; the king told the head female servant to prepare the rooster; she threw out the head, since it was not fit for the king; Yekuno Amlak, a soldier of the Zague king, cut grass for the king's mules and carried the firewood; he ate the head of the rooster; the Zague king went back to Takla Haymanot for an explanation after not finding the head; Takla Haymanot prayed for an answer and an angel appeared to him and explained that Yekuno Amlak will be the ki» g; Yekuno Amlak killed the Zague king, Elmaknun . (Cont i Rossini 1521:307-12) Though not involving the consumption of a rooster's head, the tradition among the Amarro of southern Ethiopia regarding a conflict between a newly immigrant tanner and the incumbent king also includes several structural similarities to the celebrated Šeka-Kafa epic: Woiba, the first tanner of the Amarro, migrated to the country with its first smith, Geschimale; while watching his fields one day in order to drive away any grain-destroying birds, he killed a so-called woiga bird, which was a menace to the farmers in the lowlands; after eating its head, a feather remained in his mouth and he could</page><page sequence="7">7 not remove it despite strenuous efforts; as he was eating with others one day, they asked him what he had in his mouth and he explained the whole story to them; they immediately took him to the king who ordered that his hut and the place of the bird's killing be sprinkled with the blood of a ram; the feather nevertheless remained in his mouth; the people again brought Woiba before the king and this time he ordered him to establish a separate clan and to live completely segregated from other Amarro; sub- sequently, the feather fell from his mouth. (Straube 1963:123-24) 2. Elemental Similarities 2. 1 Roosters The symbolic value of roosters in traditional Christian Ethiopian and other Semitic folklore is thoroughly a positive one. In a highly intriguing Amharic account of the betrayal of Christ by Judas, for example, a rooster ordered to follow Judas and inform Christ of his acts was granted 1000 years for his valuable service (Chaine 1905:2075-81). In another Amharic tradi- tion a rooster brought a thief and sinner to justice: a poor man wished to offer his only possession, a rooster, to the saint Gabra Manfus Qeddus, but a thief stole the animal and ate it; the rooster, however, crowed at midnight within the belly of the thief until his death (Bezold 1916:78). Another Amharic document has it that the rooster was one of the constant companions of Solomon (Dillmann 1853b). The Arabic manuscript Misal i relates that it was the rooster which called Adam to daily prayer; indeed the rooster is equated with the heralder of the day, the dissipator of the "dark powers, genni and satans" (Salzberger 1907:88). Perhaps this function of the rooster as a prayer-caller accounts for the "strange" custom 19th century Ethiopians had of not eating roosters after they have once crowed, which Salt (cited in Ruppel 1838:98; Vol. II) was unable to explain. The traditional Easter meal of an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, however, consists of chicken gul ash and curd which is eaten at midnight before Easter Sunday (Haberland 1973:3). Interestingly enough, a contemp- orary holy man in Gondar ate a special hen in an effort to acquire "poetic medicine" (Heyer 1971 : 1 30 ) . The Amarro used the rooster as a sacrificial animal during an annual rite at their border with their traditional rivals to the east, the Gudļji Oromo; in this rite a rooster was sent flying into Gudčji land by a low-caste member accompanied by curses directed at the Gudļji Oromo by non-caste Amarro who considered the Gudćji as the root of all evil (Straube 1963:123). The rooster is also a sacrificial animal among the Konso (Wohlenberg 1936:461) and the Še (Lange 1975:243). It appears as if the Gato of southern Ethiopia have also accorded roosters a symbolic place in their religious system: the highly unusual and famed wooden sculptures mrking several Gato graves show anthropomorphic figures with headgear strikingly similar to a rooster's comb (see Jensen 1936: Tafel 30; Abb. 72, 14?, 144, 145). In this light, frequent šeka reference in their folklore tc the beauty of a rooster's comb and even the traditional Tsara hairdo consisting of a single, broad band down the center of the head take on added significance. The head of a rooster--or more specifically, its comb--hac a highly positive association among 19th century northern Ethiopians as well: And on the little fingers they [Abyss i n i ans ] suffer the nails to grow as long as they will, like cocke's spurres, which also they sometimes cut from cockes and fit to their fingers. (anonymous; cited in Russell 1833:313) Directly related to this ideological complex is the Kafa belief that the most powerful Kafa spirit (detateno) changes into a bird upon the death of its medium; consequently, adherents of the cult do not eat birds considered</page><page sequence="8">8 unclean for all except the hunters (Cecchi 1888:416-17). Contemporary šeka similarly believe that the souls of those deceased males with certain burn- marks along their arms will be reincarnated asvbirds (Lange 1978:67). The Boša and Hinnaro kings (and probably also the Seka and Kafa ones) annually performed rites to feed birds. Birds of a particular species landed on the shoulder of the correct candidate for kingship among the Benš, Še and Basketto (Lanqe 1975:277). Considering the widespread religious associa- tions between man and certain birds it is understandable that nearly no pagan southern Ethiopian traditionallyvate birds or chickens (Haberland 1965:243). These exceptions included Ganģero tanners and potters as well as Kafa adult males (Cecchi 1888:420; Bieber 1920:247). Though only fol- lowed in the remote areas of Kafa, the culinary prohibition on chicken and eggs thrived in 1973 Šeka. Though Bieber (1920:339) claims no Kafa would eat an egg and d'Abbadie (1890:65) maintains that exclusively Kafa females ate eggs, contemporary Kafa do indeed consume chicken eggs. 2.2 Animal Heads Although totally forgotten among contemporary Kafa, a former sacrificial Kafa rite involved, inter alia, consumption of the head and four feet of a sacrified steer by a medium's assistants (Bieber 1923:413-17); the medium himself never partook of these parts (Bieber 1909:43). A similar practice existed among the Dorse of southern Ethiopia: at the inaugural ceremony of a candidate for the highest Dorse political office the skull of the sacri- ficed animal was given to the high priest's assistants; the head of a slaughtered goat was given the same men shortly prior to the expiration of the priest's term (Straube 1963:188, 191). During another Dorse ceremony the head of the black sheep carried on the shoulders of two religious officers was exclusively eaten by their servants {ibid: 189). One of the three sacred items possessed by the highest officer of the Konso people, the Gada-Djila, was a headless and legless figure in the form of a calf representative of the highest Konso being, the D j ila (Jensen 1936:367). A black cow having borne a calf also played a religious role among the 18th century Agau of northern Ethiopia: such a cow's head was annually plunged into a sacred waterhole, its carcass halved, divided and eaten, its bones piled and burnt to ashes and "after they have finished their bloody banquet, they carry the head, close wrapt from sight in the hide, into the cavern, which they say reaches below the fountains, and there by a common light, without torches, or a number of candles, as denoting a solemnity, they perform their worship, the particulars of which I never could learn. . .Neither would they tell me what became of the head, whether it was eaten, or buried, or how consumed. .. "(Bruce 1804:395; Vol. 5). The rite among the fianćjero based on the "fanany" myth in which the head of the first worm crawling out of the nose of a deceased öanijero king must be bitten off by his son and successor (Straube 1963:333; Fernandez in Beckingham and Huntingford 1954:160) certainly has a place within this ideological and ritual complex relegating the heads of sacred animals and their consumers a special status. 2. 3 Golden Rings Discovering the golden symbols of authority within the belly of a fish and thereby assuming political power is a legendary element hardly restrict- ed to Kafa. It has a wide distribution in Semitic literature, particularly in Ethiopian Christian documents. For three long years Solomon journeyed about, begging his way from city to city, and from country to country... At the end of that time, God took mercy upon him for the sake of his father David, and for the sake of the pious princess Naamah, the daughter</page><page sequence="9">9 of the Ammonite king, destined by God to be the ancestress of the Messiah. The time was approaching when she was to become the wife of Solomon and reign as queen in Jerusalem. God therefore led the royal wanderer to the capital city of Ammon. Solomon took service as an underling with the cook in the royal house- hold, and he proved himself so proficient in the culinary art that the king of Ammon raised him to the post of chief cook. Thus he came under the notice of the king's daughter Naamah, who fell in love with her father's cook. In vain her parents endeavored to persuade her to choose a husband befitting her rank. Not even the king's threat to have her and her beloved executed availed to turn her thoughts away from Solomon. The Ammonite king had the lovers taken to a barren desert, in the hope that they would die of starvation there. Solomon and his wife wandered through the desert until they came to a city situated by the seashore. They purchased a fish to stave off death. When Naamah prepared the fish, she found in its belly the magic ring belonging to her husband, which he had given to Asmodeus, and which, thrown into the sea by the demon, had been swallowed by a fish. Solomon recognized his ring, put it on his finger, and in the twinkling of an eye he transported himself to Jerusalem. Asmodeus, who had been posing as King Solomon during the three years, he drove out, and himself ascended the throne again. (Ginzberg 1 9^7 : Vol. IV, 170-71) From the 11th century Arabic document Tai abi, the following account of Solomon's fantastic discovery of the ring is recorded: On the 3rd day, he left and came to the shore of a sea. There was a fisher, to whom he spoke: 'Would you give me some- thing if I help you?' Yes, replied the other. Then he helped him, and as he was finished the fisher gave him two f4shes... Then he cut the stomach of one, and there was a ring in it. He took the ring and put it in his clothes and praised God; he put the fishes together and brought them into his house. His wife was pleased and asked: 'I wish you would invite my parents here, so that they may see that you tried to earn a living by yourself.' He did invite them and he gave them food. As they were finished, he asked them: 'Do you not recognize me?' They said: 'No, by God, just that we have never seen a more handsome one than you.' Then he took out the ring and put it on. Then birds swirled around him and the winds also, and he was imbued with a power, and he carried the girl and her parents from the place to Persepolis. (Salzberger 1907:127) A Muslim merchant tried to deceive an impoverished Christian deacon, according to a tradition contained in an Ethiopian manuscript, by giving him a golden ring as a deposit and then secretly stealing it from him; he then threw the ring into a river; on the day upon which the ring was to be returned to the Muslim the deacon found it in the belly of a fish (Grohmann 1919:272). A verse in a song of praise to Mary in another Ethiopian document contains the following noteworthy passage: "...A fish carrying a golden piece, swam through the depths and came upon the shore" (Grohmann 1919:272). The Ethiopian Synaxarium similarly relates an interesting tale regarding the discovery of a key in a fish's belly and the victory of a poor youth: A woman gave a miraculous birth to a boy-child, which an angel declared would inherit the wealth of a rich man; the rich man heard what the angel of the Lord said to the poor woman and wished to kill her child; Michael, the angel, protected the child from the evil intents of the rich man; as the boy grew to the age of</page><page sequence="10">10 ten, the poor woman was forced to offer him as a servant to the rich man; the man made a wooden box, and fastened the cover over him, and he carried the box to the river, and cast it into the water, and he also cast the key of the box into the river.5 And by the Will of God the box floated on the surface of the river until it came to the quay of a certain city which was not far from the river. And there was a certain shepherd who was watching and tending his flocks, and when he saw the box in the river, he dragged it out, and carried it into his house, and he was thinking by what means he could open the box. And as he was thinking about this matter, God put the thought into his heart that he should go to the river, and straightway he went and found a man catching fish. And the shepherd said unto him, 'Cast [thy] net into the river in my name, and I will give thee the price of the fish which shall be caught.' And the fisherman did as the shepherd told him. And a great fish came out from the net, and the shepherd gave him the price thereof; and taking it he went to his house, and he killed the fish to broil it, that he and his household might eat. And having slit open the belly of the fish he found a key inside it, and he said within himself, 'Perhaps this is the key of the box.' And having inserted the key into the keyhole of the box, the box opened quickly, and the shepherd marvelled for he found inside it the boy whom the rich man wanted to kill. (Budge 1 928 : 987~9 1 ) It is not a too distant cognitive jump from a golden ring in the belly of a fish to a golden ring in the beaker of an edible liquid. Such is the case with a version of the fantastic account of Solomon and Sheba contained in a Coptic manuscript: "Then he [took?] a cup of wine and gave it to her [and laid?] his ring in it..." (Ermann 1897:25). A golden ring, beyond being the royal insignia of nearly all Western Cushitic kingdoms, is also found to a limited extent in southern Ethiopian oral traditions. A Kafa tradition has it that two Waho-clan brothers migrating to Kafa from Hinnaro agreed to toss their golden insignia into the Godjeb river; only the one, however, did so (Lange 1978:353). It is said that the son of the first Wolamo king found the golden ring of his father--which his uncle, the incumbent king, allowed to fall into a pot of porridge--and was thereby revealed as the proper, legal ruler of Wolamo (Haberland 1965:265). The Boša king had his golden ring immersed in the blood of a sacrificed steer as an integral part of his installment ceremony (Lange 1978:181). 2. 4 Sky Voice Thę clearest symbolic association of the various elements contained in the Seka-Kafa legend of the Matto-Minļjo change of power is the role played by the "Voice from the sky." Christian Ethiopian Orthodox literature is full of such occurrences: the monk Yohannes heard a voice from the sky proclaiming that king Na'od (1494-1508) will reign, will be praised and will be different (Perruchon 1894:363); a voice from heaven cried out to the young saint Takla Haymanot to go to the land of Damot and begin his evange- lization work there (Budge 1928:1243); after living in Damot for twelve years a voice from heaven called out to the same saint again on Easter day proclaiming that all those who called upon his name would be delivered from all tribulation and sorrow ( i bi d : 1 244 ) ; a voice from heaven ordered the Archbishop of Constantinople to go to the house of the Emperor Theodosius and sanctify the body of the saint Gabra Krestos (Budge 1898:138); a voice from the sky informed the Patriarch of Constantinople, Theophile, of the death of a saint in the compound of the emperor while Theophile was in church celebrating the sacrament (Cerulli 1969:53).</page><page sequence="11">11 2.5 Koso Purgative Tapeworms were endemic to Ethiopian society. Reports from the middle of the 19th century on the incidence of tapeworm afflictions among Ethio- pians speak of the "absolute necessity" to take the traditional purgative (koso) against the tapeworm every two months in order to enjoy "the most ordinary health" and the presence of tapeworms among all "Abyssinians" at some time in their lives (Russell 1833:301; Stern 1862:63-66, 152; Rochet 1841:309). Suffering from the presence of parasitic tapeworms was and to a certain extent still is common in many parts of Ethiopia; the basic beliefs associated with the purgative are similarly standard in both southern and northern Ethiopia. According to Worrell (1914/15:136), the popular belief was that the affliction was caused by a red snake penetrat- ing the body. Considering the despicable symbolic value of snakes of any color and their frequent association with demons in Ethiopian Christianity, it is not surprising that those suffering from tapeworm afflictions are considered unclean: "But he who has seen the tapeworm may not stand within the church, but must make his salam from a distance, till he had drunk koso and become clean" (Walker 1933:75). The koso tree (Hagenia abyssinica) produces the folk remedy (also called koso) used throughout Ethiopia for tapeworm afflictions. The tree itself apparently took on significance beyond itsvmedicinal importance among some southern Ethiopian peoples. Among the Gangero, for example, the koso tree was a privilege of the king and perhaps its leaves were also restricted solely for the king's use (Straube 1963:293). Two koso trees enfenced with bamboo marked the royal sacrificai site of the Dita [ibid: 226). In a Darasa tradition a woman killed her husband by giving him too much koso at once (Jensen 1936:536). The application of koso is also not without associative be- havioral patterns: among the Kafa the user of koso remained in his house and permitted no visitors (Bieber 1909:55); contemporary Amharic belief holds that a "person who has just taken one of these medicines should not mix with people and in particular with those who are likely to have had sexual intercourse any time within the previous night or day" (Gerima 1955:31). The author fails to fully explain this belief, but the implica- tions seem to be that koso is dangerous for the growth of a human fetus. If this is correct, then that person suffering from a case of tapeworms is ostracized as unclean for the duration of the affliction and that person recently having administered koso to himself is considered an obstructor of life's development. Put into the context of the Šeka-Kafa epic, the Matto king suffering from tapeworms and having taken koso was no longer within the realm of divine kingship; among the Kafa a king believed to obstruct prosperity and life simply could not continue to be king. ŠEKA GODÌI EPIC The Šeka people were ruled 1n the 16th century by an indigenous ruling class summarized within contemporary consciousness as the Batto clan. During the latter half of the 16th century, however, Batto rule was replaced by Bušašo rule. The transfer of power is envisioned by the Šeka elders as a series of events surrounding a few key historical figures such as Gahočči , Godģi and Godgi's four sons. Gahocci was forced to flee from the land of the Batto clan. He left his wife and his mother behind in Batto clan territory. The men of the Batto clan told all other men in the area not to allow their semen to enter her vagina. They were permitted to have sexual intercourse with her, but not permitted to let her get pregnant. The mother-in-law of the woman found semen on an ensete leaf on the bed. She mixed it with teff flour and made</page><page sequence="12">12 bread from it and gave it to the woman to eat. She ate it and she later gave birth to a boy-child, whom she called Godgi.6 When the people of the area heard of this birth they wanted to kill the child. All the women of the area came to the house of the woman with the intent of killing the child by jumping on him. They told the mother, however, they wanted only to see the child. The mother and ¿he mother-in-law both realized what they really wished to do; they therefore hid the child and placed the flower of the ensete plant in the bed and covered it with a sheet. The visiting women jumped on the flower thinking it was the child. The mother screamed: 'You have killed my child!' The women ran away. The mother then gave the child to a wife of a tanner who raised the child. The boy grew. During the game of holekasso [similar to field hockey] the boy exclaimed: 'I am the son of Gah I ! ' The other players told this to their fathers and asked them: 'The son of the tanner says that he is the son of Gah î ! What does this mean?' After hearing this the fathers really suspected that God^i was the son of Gahl and attempted to kill him. They said: 'We have ruined Gahl I How did we get his re- placement!' They then threw him over a ci iff with a waterfall. They threw him down the waterfall. The boy fell Into the branches of the tree and did not get hurt. He was nourished while entangled in the branches of the tree by the water of imano vines. The fluid of these imano vines dripped Into his mouth. Geho and Geragaččo, two men from cabero clans, found the boy In the tree-branches and took him and raised him. (the fa-rasa, Fa'o clan elder; Žeka-Geča; 11/72) The Ba-tata was going to marry the daughter of the Anfillo king. Godgi went with them to the wedding ceremony. After Godgi sang songs, the bride declared that she would only marry the singer. The Anfillo king said the singer was the slave of her groom. He said she should marry the Ba-tata and not his slave. The bride was Insistent. The father then took back all the gifts prepared for her and gave her only a bag of cheap bead-work in their place. She gave birth to four sons In her marriage to Godgl. (the nlfa-rasa, Ado clan elder; Šeka-Bonga; 11/72) God^fl had four sons who were raised In the country of the Anfillo king. The sons were: Kawlno, Wol-tato, Wolasa and Gaki Goečči . In Anfillo there was a battle between the Anfillo and a neighboring people. At these battles the two parties would send only one warrior each to the river to battle. The victorious warrior would return and two other warriors would continue the fight. This would continue until all the warriors of one party were killed or fled. Wol-tato went to do battle with an enemy warrior at one of these battles. Before beginning the fight he said to the other: 'I have come alone, but why did you bring this other person!' The other warrior then turned to see the other person, who was not there. Wol-tato said this only to deceive him. While his back was turned, Wol-tato stabbed him and killed him and then returned to tell his brother, Gakl Goeccl. Gakl Goeccl then went to the river to fight and performed the same trick. He returned and told his brother who did the same. The fourth brother also did the same... (the nifa-rasa, Ado clan elder; Šeko-Ado; 11/72) When the four brothers came to this land they hid themselves in a 'gudo' called 1 kas I ' . The problem of kingship was settled very well. The people brought a hat made by the hunters. The hat was made out of gureza monkey skin. All the people spit Into the hat. Even the sick spit into the hat. Women and children spit into the hat. Everyone</page><page sequence="13">13 did. The people then mixed the spit in the hat with honey-wine and gave it to each of the four brothers to drink. Wol-tato only tasted it with his tongue and vomitted. Then he left. Wolała started drink- ing, but vomitted and left. Kasihočíi did the same and left. Del lani drank all of it without vomi tt ing. 7 He had a stomach-ache for four days afterwards. His stomach swelled and he drank some medicine to cure it. The people then said: 'This man will become our king!1 He swallowed our saliva, our 'mo1!' De Ianni was required to take an oath swearing that he would be a good and just king, (the fa-rasa, Fa'o clan elder; Šeka-Damawo; 10/72) 1. Compositional Similarities Considering the deep cultural bonds yniting the Šeka and Kafa people it is hardly surprising to find both the Seka national epic of God§i and the Kafa one of Minģiločči to be compositional ly similar to significant segments of the Kebra Nagaet, the literary expression of so much of Amhara and Tigrean culture. This document, however, does not hold the only and perhaps not even the most revealing cognitive precipitates of a considerable cultural bond between the Šeka and northern Ethiopian cultures. The Ethiopie translation of the Pseudo-Call i sthenes version of Alexander the Great's exploits, and the Ethiopie edition detailing the acts of an Armenian king, Tertag, both contain literary forms and contents remarkably similar to the Šeka epic. The closest compositional similarities to the Godiļi epic, however, are found among another southern Ethiopian people, the Wo lamo. Sebato came from Tigre and settled in Wolamo. He became a king in Wolamo. Later he had a son called Liben, who became king. Liben had only one wife who gave him no children. His wife was pregnant upon his death. The brother of Liben became the Wolamo king. He went to a man who foretells the future, who told him that his kingdom would not last long and that the sons of his brother, Liben, would become the kings. Liben' s brother then decided to kill the sons of his brother. The wife of Liben had heard of this intent and asked the women in the area if there was any woman who became pregnant about the time she did and gave birth to a son about the time she did. They told her that there was a potter woman who had just given birth to a son. The potter was called to her. The two women exchanged sons.8 At the age of eight the son of the former king raised by the potter was taking part in a spear-throwing contest. The object was to get the spear into a round target a good distance away from the thrower. The boy did much better than any of the others. He scored in every toss. The Wolamo king was returning from an elephant hunt at the time and happened to pass through the area of the contest. He saw the boy perform so well and declared that he must be of his own family and not a son of a potter. He was sure that the boy was the son of his brother and took him, calling him a "manna," as a prisoner with him; he was unable to figure out how he got to a potter woman. He also took prisoner his parents, who claimed to be his real parents, and threatened to kill them and their so-called son. Then the wife of Liben came to the king and declared the boy to be her son. She told the king not to kill the two fuga , but to do whatever else he wished. The people hearing about the case said that the boy should not be killed if he were raised by the fuga. The people would not allow the king to kill the son of the former king. The boy was then taken to the palace by his real mother and he was provided with a horse, a spear and all other things that the sons</page><page sequence="14">14 of the political rulers of Wolamo had. He began playing with the sons of the political officers of Wolamo. The future-teller told the Wolamo king -hat when an elephant comes out of the forest and the son of the former king spears it first, then he will become king, but if the Wolamo king did it first, then his son will become king." The man also said whichever of the two first cuts the throat of a newly-born white bull from any cow in Wolamo would become the next ruler. The king told all the leaders în Wolamo to tell him when an elephant comes into the field or when a white bull is born. The leaders wished to support the son of their last king and not his brother. One of them saw an elephant in a field and told the son of the last king. He went and speared the elephant with his spear. Then the leader began to shout that an elephant had come out. The Wolamo king quickly went to the place and saw that it was already bleeding and asked who did this. The leader shouted: 'Tube did it! Tube did it!1 Later a white bull was born and another leader told Tube of it. Tube slit its throat. Then the leader yelled that a white bull had been born. The Wolamo king hurried to the place as people told him that the throat had already been cut. He asked who did it. They told him that Tube had done it. The king then handed Tube the gold and gave him the kingship, (son of the last talle-raša, Kafa-Yirgo clan elder; Kafa-Tallo; 5/73) Other Kafa elders varied a few details of this notable tradition. One variation has it that the potter gave birth to a daughter, whereas Liben' s wife gave birth to a son. Another one indicates that the pregnant potter went to the residence of the former queen, and both gave birth to sons in the same house and on the same day; in other words, the potter gave birth in the residence of the former Wolamo king. A third variation specifies that Liben' s brother returned from buffalo-hunting with his entourage when he encountered his nephew, whose face he claimed resembled that of Liben; the people with the boy declined to answer the king's inquiries regarding the boy's origins. Containing the same central theme of a royal servant dramatically achieving royal status is a tradition derived from a manuscript found in the Debra Li banos monastery regarding the beginnings of the Zague dynasty. Now Delna'ad was troubled by his daughter, because his faithful (or believing) ones told him that she would seize his kingdom. And the king said, 'If she would seize my kingdom cast her into the sea1; and they cast her into the sea placed in a wooden chest. And there was a young man, a servant of the king, of the men of the city of Hamasen; and that young man whose name was Takla Haymanot took out that maiden secretly (?) . And he said to the king, '0 my Lord, swear to me thou wilt fulfill for me my heart's desire'; and the king swore to Takla Haymanot that he would do what he wanted done. And after the king had sworn to him Takla Haymanot said to him, 'Give me thy daughter.' And the king was sorry both for the sake of his oath and because of that daughter, and he gave her to him with great difficulty (i.e. reluctance), and he set the young man over this city. And as Takla Haymanot was walking through the city over which he had been appointed, all the soldiers of the king followed him, for the king was angry and had given them orders to seize Takla Haymanot, and when they were unable to do so, the king himself went to fight with him. And Takla Haymanot killed Delna'ad and seized the kingdom, and he took the kingdom of Israel. Now the name of Takla Haymanot as king was Zawege. And he begot three children and one girl. (Budge 1928:216-17)</page><page sequence="15">15 The leitmotif of a servant of royalty winning the daughter of royalty for an outstanding feat is coupled in the Ethiopie account of Tertag, a celebrated Armenian king, with a duel scene highly reminiscent of the šeka epic. 9 And as both armies [Roman and "Barbarian"] came together and were poised for battle, the barbarian king sent a messenger to the Roman king with the message: 'Why should the blood of our troops be shed for our sake? Not so! We should match each other in a duel! If you are the victor, then take my troops and my country: if I should be the victor, then I will take your country and your warriors.1 Upon hearing this, the Roman king was struck with great fear, because he was not as strong as the other. He called his officers together and spoke to them: 'Who is the man who can battle the barbarian king?' They answered him: 'No one among us is capable to fight with him, since he is very strong and evil.' Only one officer, the master of Tertag, said to the king: 'Among my men is an extraordinarily strong young warrior, who is certainly capable of battling him.' The king told him: 'Bring him to me!' They called him before the king. He asked him: 'Will you be able to fight with the barbarian king?' ' Certainlý, he replied, 'but give me your stallion, your sword and your clothing which identifies the king.1 The king told him: 'If you overcome the barbarian king in battle, then my daughter will become your wife, and I will raise you to high honors: indeed, I would give up to you one-half of my kingdom.' Thereafter he was given the royal stallion, sword and ćlothing. He mounted the stallion and rode towards the barbarian king. With his eyes directed at him, this king came to him for battle. And a second time Tertag came to him and spoke to him with deceitful words: 'Why did you bring these soldiers with you? Did we not wish to match each other in a duel?' As soon as the king had heard this, he turned around to see if his troops really did follow him. Then, at the moment in which the king turned his back towards him, Tertag struck him with his sword and cut off his head, which he brought to the Roman king. Then the Roman king pursued the barbarian troops and mowed them dov.n, without leaving one survivor. And they returned to their country full of joy. (Bachmann 1888:1-2, cf. Basset 1 89^ : 28-38) 1 0 Equally notable is the repetition of this deceitful and clever victory during a duel in the Ethiopie translation of the Psuedo-Call isthenes version of the Alexander legend. According to this version, the armies of Alexander and Porus (the king of India) had fought each other for about 20 days. Porus used elephants and lions against the forces of Alexander, but the Greeks cleverly constructed elephants of brass, heated them with a great fire and burned the trunks of the attacking Indian elephants. In another attempt to rout Alexander's forces, Porus had his magicians use their magic to cause Alexander's mare to throw hin, an event which deeply worried Alexander. And it came to pass that when Alexander saw this he drew nigh unto their midst, being himself In great tribulation, and he wished to stop the fight. And having commanded the soldiers to cease fighting, he cried out, saying, '0 Porus, king of India, behold I perceive and know thy strength and might, and moreover, what thou doest lieth hard upon me, and my heart is weary; and I have considered the fatigue whereby we all are perishing. Now, although I may wish to destroy my own life, I would not that all these men... should perish, for it Is I who have brought[ them] nigh unto death here, and It Is not a right thing for a king to</page><page sequence="16">16 deliver his soldiers unto death and to save his own life. Now I would that we command our armies to cease fighting for a little, and that we two go down and do battle with each other; whosoever slayeth his neighbour shall take his kingdom, and his soldiers shall be servants unto him, and whatsoever he willeth he shall do unto them.1 And it came to pass that when Porus, the king of India, heard these words, the thing was pleasing unto him, and he rejoiced within himself, for he was a strong and mighty man and of huge stature. Now Alexander was small and weak, and Porus, the king of India, held him in contempt, and he imagined that he would be able to stretch out his hand towards him and to seize him [in it]. So Alexander ordered his soldiers to cease fighting and Porus ordered his troops to cease fighting, and the two armies retreated each to its own place; then Alexander and Porus drew nigh to each other, each going on foot. And it came to pass that when Porus, the king, on hearing a terrible uproar among his soldiers, turned around and looked behind him to see what had happened among his troops, Alexander, who was watching the king of India, saw him turn, and rose up against him and stabbed him with his [sword]above his shoulders and he pierced him also in his belly and slew him. Now when the army of Porus saw that their king was slain they were smitten with grief, and became full of wrath, and they threw themselves again Into the fight. (Budge 1896:123-25) Expressive of the durability such an element of deceit in battle has within Semitic ideology is the fact that the Indian ruler's defeat at the hands of Alexander through ingenious trickery is highlighted in the Alexander versions of Al-Makin, Abu Shaker, Ibn Al-Rahib and of Ben-Gorion (ibid: 370-71 ;395-96;420-21 ) . In a short but highly notable Tigrean tradition of a battle between two soldiers we have the following passage: Tasfacon appeared before his adversary with his lance In his right hand; then he suddenly took It In his left one and stabbed him In his uncovered side; as this man was run through, he called out: 'You did not tell me that there were two; you told me there was only one and let me proceed uncovered...1 (Littmann 1906:955) Though exhibiting no compositional similarities to the Seka Godģi epic as it does to the Kafa Minļjiločči one, the Kebra Nagast nevertheless containes at least one tradition reflective of themes, particularly an unusual pregnancy, conrnon to the šeka epic. According to this Kebra Nagast tradition of the "King of Persia," we learn that a certain Juda had three sons with different destinies; the eldest one died Before he could give his wife, Thamar, a child; the second one was killed by God for allowing his semen to fall on the ground during sexual intercourse with Thamar; the third was too young for marriage to Thamar. Juda, the father-in-law of Thamar, enclosed her 1n her father's house under close supervision; after giving her a sceptre, a ring and a hat Juda had sexual intercourse with Thamar; the servants of Juda called her a whore and the elders wished to stone the pregnant Thamar. (Bezold 1909:80) 2, Elemental Similaritie8 2.1 Pregnancy Through Eating The founder of the Sas clan among the Sanäero of southern Ethiopia 1s said, like Godgl among the Seka, to have been bom of a mother Impregnanted through eating:</page><page sequence="17">17 A man of the 'pure1 KaumI clan, which is to be differentiated from the 'black' Kaumi , went to the lowlands and asked his neighbor to daily milk his cow which had just given birth. One day, however, a bull squirted his semen in the fresh milk; the man did not wish to drink the polluted milk and set It aside. His daughter, who knew nothing of the occurrence, drank the milk and became pregnant. She bore a son named Sas and who became the founder of the clan with the same name. The word sas means 'cow' in the Galla language. (Straube 1963:307) Though lacking any explicit, causal connection between eating and pregnancy, several Ethiopian Christian traditions do emphasize the con- sumption of a particular food prior to fertilization. Perhaps older ideological cores became shrouded with the advent of Christianity in a Christianized cloak. In a Tigrean version of the Solomon-Sheba tradition, Sheba ate some honey dripping into a bowl before having sexual intercourse with Solomon (Littmann 1904:7), whereas the more commongly known Kebra Nagast version has her drinking a cup of water prior to seduction by Solomon (Bezold 1909:20). The dust from the grave of Takla Haymanot was mixed with water and given to a barren woman, who subsequently gave birth (Budge 1906:302). Similarly, a child containing teeth upon parturi- tion was born to a woman who had drunk rain falling on the day of Takla Haymanot' s commemoration {ibid: 303). Both the saint Jafqerana Egzi and the nun Walattal Pretos are noted in Christian literature for their ability to induce fertility by administering blessed water to a woman (Wajnberg 1917:85-87; Heyer 1971:195). 2.2 Victorious Illegitimate Son According to the famed Kebra Nagast account of Sheba' s encounter with Solomon, Makeda (Sheba) was seduced by Solomon through trickery and gave birth to a boy-child, Baina-lehkem (Menel ik); Baina-lehkem asked his peers who is father was, and they told him that it was Solomon. He then asked his mother about the identity of his father, but she re- fused to give him a satisfying answer until he repeated the question three times. As a young man Baina-lehkem was handsome and a highly skilled horseman and hunter; his mother sent him to Solomon with the trader Tamrin so that he would be named king of Ethiopia. Solomon immediately recognized his son and wished to make him king over Israel; Baina-lehkem told him that since he was not the son of his lawful wife, he could not be his successor in Israel. Solomon then made him king of Ethiopia and sent the first-born sons of 21 nobles of Israel with him to Ethiopia. (Bezold 1909:14-29) A Tigrean version of the Solomon-Sheba tradition makes some notable changes: firstly, Sheba and one of her female ministers went to Solomon disguised as men; secondly, they drank honey and not water as they broke their oath; thirdly, Solomon slept with both women. And he approached them both and slept with them. Each one of them said to him: 'My deflowering has been accomplished.' And he gave each one of them a staff of silver and a ring, saying unto them: 'If it is a girl, let her take this staff of silver and come to me; and if it is a boy, let him take this ring and come to me.' And the Queen of the South bought a mirror. And being [both] with child they returned to their country. And both of them gave birth to a son. When t;he boys were grown, the Tigre people said: 'They are fatherless children.' And they asked their mothers. And their mothers answered them: 'Your father is King Solomon; he lives in Jerusalem.' And the son of the Queen of the South resembled his father perfectly, [even]</page><page sequence="18">18 in his color he was like King Solomon. Now she said to him: 'My son, thy father resembles thee. Take this mirror and go [to him]; for he is very shrewd: he will hide himself from thee. And if thou seest another man sitting on the throne, do not greet him!' Then they went to Jerusalem. And when they arrived, King Solomon said: 'If they are my sons, let them wait!' So he stayed away from them three years, without showing himself to them. After these three years he said: 'Let them come in"; but he had taken off his royal garment and dressed himself in rags; and on his throne he had seated one of his people, and he [himself] had gone into the stable. And when they entered, the other boy grasped the hand of the man who was sitting on the throne, [to greet him]: but Menel ik stood [still and] straight and looked at his face in the mirror and [saw that] the man's colour was not like his. Then he turned in all [directions], but did not find any one whose colour was like his. After a while Solomon looked out from the stable: [at once Menel ik] went to him and took his hand [to greet him]. Then said Solomon: '[Thou art] my true son; the other is my son too, but he is a fool,' and he seated himself on his throne. (Littmann 190^:6-9) Also from the Kebra Nagast is the story of a wife of a merchant who gave birth to an illegitimate, handsome son by Karmin, the former mule- leader of the king of Israel; she gave the child to her servant to throw into the river. At the same time "the Queen of Babylon gave birth to something which was like unto an eagle, a perfect bird but altogether without wings"; the queen commanded her favorite handmaiden to toss it into the river. Both servants met at dawn before the tossing and they exchanged boxes. The one with the eagle-like child threw the box into the river and the queen's servant returned to her lady with the other box; the queen was pleased and named the child Nebachadnezzar. (Bezold 1909:78-79) Even elements from the Judith legend are perhaps relevant in this regard: "Judith" massacred all the sons of the Ethiopian king on top of Debra Damo with the exception of one small boy, who escaped her wrath and found asylum among the Shoans (cited in Ferret and Gal inier 1847:297-98). 2.3 Two Brothers Traditions of two migrating "brothers" bringing about some sort of radical change are found in both the Christian literature of northern Ethiopia and particularly in the oral traditions and folklore of southern Ethiopian peoples. Abreha and Asbeha, the twins who simultaneously ruled in Axum (Sergew 1972:92-93), "introduced Christianity to Ethiopia (Dillmann 1853:343-48) . 1 1 Abba Salama, an early Ethiopian Christian convert and also instrumental in introducing Christianity during the reign of Abreha and Asheba, also had a brother who had traveled with him to Ethiopia from Jerusalem (Budge 1906, Vol. 1:7-10). Similarly, a son of Solomon and a son of the Israelite high priest came to Ethiopia with copies of the Ten Commandments (ibid: 566). Another Ethiopian document relates that Za-Michael, his mother, and a travelling companion left the court of Ezana and travelled to the Debra Damo area; his mother dies by a river in the vicinity of Debra Damo and Za-Michael introduced Christian- ity to the region (Guidi 1895:88-89). According to a Coptic tradition, two workers from Egypt, Theodosius and Dionysius, were chosen by God in a dramatic fasion to be the new king and bishop, respectively (Ermann 1897:29-30). 12 The element of "two brothers" being responsible for qualitative change within society is especially widespread in the oral traditions of peoples in southernvEthiopia. Among the Seka,vthe "four brothers" Derihanocči, Gisanočči, Kawintateno, Dellihanočči) can be conceptually</page><page sequence="19">19 paired off into two groups of "brothers", Woli o and Busaso, with the former producing the religious and the latter the political heads of the traditional Šeka kingdom. Traditions of two migrating "brothers'^ are fairly common among the Kafa; these include such events as 1) Mango and Matto both emerging from a hole, 2) Mango and Mingo travelling to- gether to Kafa, 3) Mango leading Matto to Kafa, 4) two Waho-clan brothers coming together to Kafa. In addition to these traditions focusing on two "brothers", Kafa elders also recall others: Dugo and Mingí loččí were brothers. Both came together. Their father blessed both of them. One became the king and the other was filled with the spirit, (the gučče-raša, elder of the Gučče-Amaro clan; outskirts of Bonga; June 1973) Midgili and Safo came out of a river together. They were brought to the residence of the Matto king. The Matte-tato cut the ears of these two men since there were very long.13 Land was given to Safo and work in the house of the king was given to Midgili. (the fa-rasa, elder of the Seko Fa'o clan; Geça; November 1972) Two brothers came to Kafa from Me'ens. Shortly after their arrival, one of the brothers died. The surviving one received the spirit. (the ibede-gudo, medium of detateno; Bonga; June 1973) Two brothers, Jakkama and Mindscho, travelled with their mother from a sea and finally arrived in the vicinity of Kafa following a two month journey, during which they nourished them- selves by hunting. Jakkama, who was tired of the many sufferings endured on the trip, opposed his mother and wished to kill her with a spear. Fortunately, the wound was not fatal and healed within a short time by the grace of Mindscho's care. The mother blessed Mindscho and cursed Jakkama banning him to the Borru hill. (Bieber 1923:487-88; cf. Cecchi 1886, Vol. I I : 488-89) 1 ^ The Anfillo have a tradition that three men (one high caste and two low caste members) and one dog emerged from the forest's ground; the high caste (Busasi) assumed leadership and developed "a new race of men" (Grottanelli 1940:294-98). Similarly, the first Sido chief is said to have migrated from Kafa with three dogs (cf. Jensen 1959:164). Two brothers migrated to Cako territory with the former becoming the first king of the Cako and the latter the king of another people (Straube 1963:35). The Male also have a tradition of four brothers migrating to their land; the youngest of them became chief of Male and the other three assumed leadership in surrounding chiefdoms (Jensen 1959:266). Two brothers migrated from Kamba to Male and founded two clans [ibid: 280). Inda-kati, the first Basketto king, and Borallo, his brother, both origin- ally ruled together, but Borallo drank sacrificial beer without informing his brother, and Inda-kati put his fingers to his mouth after touching Colobus monkey meat; these acts caused a cleavage and each brothér founded separate clans (Haberland 1959:197-98). Indeed the whole of Konso society is divided into moieties known as the "younger son" and the "elder son" (Jensen 1959:366). Among the Dola-Mašira two brothers arevsaid to have migrated to the land from either Kafa, Gimira or Dime. Kočodo settled in Masi ra and his elder brother settled in Da fa; both are from the Murki clan and both originally ruled together but later separated (Haberland 1959:205). Also among the Male is the tradition that four brothers from Bussa were engaged in producing fire; the eldest produced ensete and^ became king in Baka; the second produced taro and became king in Sangama; the third produced a cow and became king in Banna and the youngest produced</page><page sequence="20">20 fire and became king in Male (Jensen 1959:266). The leaders of the Argenne, Uba, and Sala people are said to have been brothers (Schul tz-Weidner 1963: 235). The Sanģero also have a number of notable traditions regarding two brothers: Bale, the founder of the Gondar dynasty in Gangero, and Kaffa were sons of Solomon and the servant of Sheba (Straube 1963:335). Another variation of this significant belief has it that Zaga and Amarro (i.e. Bale and Menel i k, respectively) were two brothers; Zaga, the younger brother of Menel i k, had a servant named Kaffa, to whom he later gave a kingdom (ibid: 335). Revealing a related dualistic structure among the Sanfero is the fact that the religious officer [magno) of most Sangero clans is a descendant of the clan founder's elder brother; a descendant of the clan founder is also invariably the traditional political head of the clan (ibid: 313). Interestingly, the founders of each half of the "Amharic" clan (yessu) had the same father but a different mother (ibid: 308). The Ganģero also have a tradition that four white men came from the sky during the reign of the Yemenite dynasty; two of them returned from where they came after a conflict with the king; the other two (whose names translate into "sky" and "cloud") stayed and are attributed with astounding accomplish- ments, such as the construction of an indestructible bridge and an iron hut (ibid: 309). Traditions of the two "brothers" are similarly common among the Amarro: the first tanner (manna) by the name of Woiba came with the first smith named Geshimale from Gamu-Gofa to Amarro (ibid: 123-24). Two brothers, Amhara and Amarro, left Manz and travelled through Kambata to Kafa; Amarro' s son, Kaba, went to the Gamu Highlands; Kaba's grandson, Donzo, migrated to Amarro (ibid: 104). According to another Amarro tradition, the sun impregnated a girl near a waterhole who subsequently suffered a stillbirth; the sun impregnated her a second time and she gave birth to twins, Woira and Inkallu. As he emerged from the womb, Woira had the tail of a cow, hair of sheep and humans, cabbage seeds, barley grains, ensete leaves and hailstones in his right hand. After the rule of five kings from the Woira dynasty the descendants of Inkallu assumed the kingship (ibid: 105-6) . Part II of this article will appear in NEAS 3.3 NOTES 1. Adinow Gerito, Abraham Solomon and Koččíto worked with me at different times among the šeka and Kafa peoples. Without their invaluable assistance and enthusiasm none of these Kafa-Šeka traditions would have been documented. The financial and institutional assistance of the Deutsche Forschuungsgemeinschaft, the Frobenius Institute and the Institute for Ethiopian Studies is gratefully acknowledged. 2. Ganzerò king-candidates were required to remain in a secluded bamboo hut for eight days; if the snakes, leopards and lions said to come to him during this time did not kill him on the first night, then he was the correct candidate (Straube 1963:348). Among the Oarassa we have a tale in which the youngest, impoverished son was required to sleep in a house filled with snakes (Jensen 1936:542). 3. In this regard it is significant that the Seka consider their Busaso rulers to have originated from 0šo Ambala (i.e. Ambi Seli, very near Gesa Amba). 4. This as well as all other quotes from non-English sources have been translated by the author. 5. The Darassa of southern Ethiopia have a tradition in which a poor, but later successful, son is placed in a box and thrown over a cliff (Jensen 1936:541). 6. Godfji ( = "replacement" in the Seka language) is an immigrant Male clan from which the high priest of the Male king came (Jensen 1959:269); interestingly enough, the Male potters also claim to be God§i members since</page><page sequence="21">21 the third son of the founder of the Godgi clan became a potter {ibid: 282); the founder of the Godgi clan, Wuamari , also married a beautiful woman who bore him four sons {ibid: 297). 7. Part of the installation rite of a Laha chief involved his drinking beer mixed with sour leaves and his subsequent vomitting (Haberland 1959:207). 8. Among the Gangero the founder of the Gudela clan, Dičangu, is said to have been found in a forest by Amharic clans during their march through Gudela; he was ordered by the later Sangero king, Bale, to be raised by the potter clan, Konkulu (Straube 1963:308). The Borana-Oromo believe their first priest-king fell from the clouds and was found shivering at the foot of a tree by members of a low occupational caste (Haberland 1964:163). Among the Gudgi-Oromo the first priest-king similarly fell from the sky early in the morning; as hunters were on their way to hunt hippos, they saw him sitting along the wayside but were afraid to touch him. After some time tanners came along and took the cloth from his face, but since he did not say anything they went on their way. Finally the Gudgi-Oromo came and took him with them. They married him with one of their daughters and made him speak. The tanners and hunters, however, complained they were the first to have seen him (Haberland 1963:302). Among the Baka a virgin potter girl appeared as a helper and protector of the first king, Serser, and gave him pottery sherds which he used to kill his enemies (Jensen 1959:37). Even the Ethiopian Christ- ian saint, Jafqerana Egzi, was once discovered entangled in a tree by a man "who carried on his work at the base of the abyss" (Wajnberg 1936:121-22). 9. A duel involving the characteristic deceit used by Godgi' s son is, of course, not the only type related in Ethiopian Christian literature. The son of Lalibala, the Zague ruler, was engaged in a duel which the Amharic chronicler compared to the battle of David and Goliath (Perruchon 1892:118). Emperor Iyasus was similarly victorious in a duel in 1700 with an Oromo leader again compared by the chronicler to Goliath (Budge 1928:418). The 16th century Islamic account of Ethiopia's conquest also records a duel between a Christian and Islamic leader (Basset 1897:158-59). 10. In addition to the duel the legend of Tertag contains several elements which are nearly repeated in content by other Seka traditions. Within both a Seka tradition and in the Ethiopie translation of the Tertag legend we find an emperor fearful of a foreign prince's abilities and plotting the prince's death through poisoning; in both cases the prince is saved from death by a compassionate young woman and flees the kingdom. (Bachmann 1888:5-6; Basset 1894:34-35; Lange 1978:249) 11. Hammerschmidt (1967:41), on the other hand, maintains they did not introduce Christianity, but reigned at the time of its introduction. 12. An eagle swept from the sky and placed Theodosious on the throne. 13. The Cako cut the ears of a young sacrificial cow and allowed the blood to flow on the deceased king's ring before killing the cow through beating (Straube 1963:46). The Seka have a similar tradition in which the ears of members of low-status clans were cut by a member of a high-status clan (Lange 1978:610). 14. The elements of fraternal conflict and parental blessing present in this notable Kafa tradition are essentially repeated in a Šeka and an Amharic one. The blind and aging widow of the Šeka Ataso and Abalo clan founder was deceived into giving her blessing to her younger son (Ataso) after requesting food from her older son (Abalo); while Abalo was gathering firewood, Ataso quickly provided his mother with food and successfully requested her blessing (Lange 1978:600). The same deceit pattern is found within the Ethiopian Synaxarium account of Isaac's sons: And he Isaac begot two sons, Easu and Jacob, and he loved Easu because of his strength and might. And when he was far advanced In days, and his eyes were feeble, he called his son Easu and said unto him, 'l have become old, 0 my son, go and hunt the wild animals of the desert, so that I may eat, and my soul shall bless thee.1 And</page><page sequence="22">22 Easu took his weapons, and went out Into the desert. And Rebecca called Jacob and said unto him, '0 my son, rise up and kill one of the goats quickly and take it to thy father so that he may eat and bless thee before he dieth...1 And Jacob did as his mother command- ed him, and he offered [food] to his father, and he ate and blessed him.
