<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSONIFICATION AS A MODE OF GREEK THOUGHT By T. B. L. Webster M y thesis in this paper is that personification (in a sense that I shall define) was a way in which the early Greeks looked at the world, and which affected their thought on all subjects, and that the peculiar achievement of the Greeks in thought can be seen as a continuous battle between the tendency to personify and the opposite tendency to schematize. Space will preclude the quotation of many examples, and I do not claim that my collection of personifications in literature and art from the late eighth to the early third century B.C. is in any way complete; excluding local personifications, personi- fications of things, and neuter personifications I count rather fewer than 300 personifications and have examined about 2,000 instances in which they occur; I hope therefore that my collection may be representative. I do not restrict the meaning of personification to the conscious creation of artificial human figures in which neither the creator nor anyone else believes. I include all cases in which something not a human being is described as if it had a quality or qualities normally associated with human beings. The obvious qualities associated with human beings are (a) physical life and movement, (b) mental powers and feelings, (c) bodily appearance as a man or woman. In any particular case of personification only one of these need be present; but I have refrained from subdividing personification into, e.g., activization, animization, anthropomorphization, because such terms would mean nothing to an ancient Greek and they obscure the unity which this way of thinking had in early times: it must be remembered that the gods whom Homer describes so vividly were often worshipped in the form of aniconic stones1- Aphrodite at Paphos, Eros at Thespiai, Charites at Orchomenos-and that when Hera goes to visit Okeanos who has quarrelled with his wife Tethys, she says, "I will go and see the boundaries of the earth, Ocean the origin of gods and mother Tethys":2 the physical fluid Ocean and the anthropomorphic Okeanos are combined in the same sentence. Okeanos is both water and person just as Aphrodite is both stone and person. It is therefore safer to use the single word personification to cover all the phenomena which form our subject, but it will be found useful later to classify personifications both according to their strength and according to their function. In an earlier paper3 I wrote: "the range of personification in Homer in- cludes inanimate things, such as the 'ruthless stone' and the spears that 'yearn to taste flesh,' natural phenomena (the heavens and the heavenly bodies, the seasons, the winds, the earth, and the body), invisible forces which affect either the human body (such as death, sleep, youth, strength, or exhaustion), or the human mind (the mind and the heart, love, fear, infatuation, prayers, justice, rumour), or human life generally such as fate and Nemesis. Homeric man is surrounded by things physical, animate, and invisible which are in- sufficiently understood. Personification is a means of taking hold of things 1 Tacitus, Hist., II, 3; Pausanias IX, 27, 1; 38, I. 2 Iliad, XIV, 200; cf.

These all seem to have some kind of life and so are in some way human." This view of the world is much older than Homer. We cannot give an account of its origin but we can see certain things which we may say and certain things that we must not say. The Olympians themselves result from a great act of systematization and personification: Hera, Ares, and the post- Homeric Eros still retain the traces in their names, and Cornford' has sug- gested that one, if not the only, starting-point for anthropomorphism is the divine man, the king who also represents the god, who combines in himself individual personality and impersonal functions; the functions being divine because they survive the individual holder of them, then become embodied in a divine being whose myth they form. If this is correct, it is a very early use of personification as a means to 'form a general notion out of particular instances. We must not, however, say that general notions are always formed like this, or that behind every abstract noun lies an earlier stage of deification or even of personification; all the personified nouns in Homer are also used impersonally and we are guessing when we try to say which use is earlier;2 we may, however, say that personification of a general idea is very easy for a people who are accustomed to take this personal view of the world. Two other sources of personification may be mentioned: Oriental litera- ture and art. It can now be regarded as established that not only the succession of divine rulers in Hesiod's Theogony but also the cosmogony with which he begins is derived from Oriental sources, and that Oriental sources were also responsible for Homer's calling Ocean the origin of all things and for Thales choosing water as his original element. But in all these cases the Greeks are not borrowing personification as a method of thinking but rather certain detailed applications of personification. There is, I think, little doubt that some of Homer's personifications such as Eris and Phobos were inspired by the terrifying figures on Oriental works of art which were becoming known to Greeks in the latter part of the eighth century (and such figures had occurred earlier in Minoan/Mycenaean art). A somewhat similar origin may be suggested for the personification of Infatuation and the Prayers in the ninth book of the Iliad,3 where Infatuation is a strong runner and the Prayers are wrinkled, squinting, lame old women. The pattern, beautiful leader and less beautiful chorus, is well known, e.g., Nausikaa and her maidens, Artemis and her nymphs, in the sixth Odyssey ;4 there may have been a similar pattern, ugly leader and less ugly chorus. A gorgon-faced Artemis appears on a Rhodian plate of the early sixth century B.C.,5 and sixth-century terra- cotta masks of wrinkled old women have been found in the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta;6 other cross-links are known to connect the worship of Artemis in the Peloponnese and in Asia Minor. I suggest that Homer 1 Principium Sapientiae 237, 257. 2 Cf.

For these personifications I have suggested a source in art. Art must also be regarded as one of the forces which helps to keep personification alive. The artist and the dramatist must personify if they want to represent some- thing immaterial instead of restricting themselves to showing its effects on visible things. Force and Strength in Aeschylus' Prometheus (to whom a new papyrus has added Dike), Madness in Euripides' Hercules Furens, and the many abstracts such as Health, Happiness, Tragedy and Procession which appear on red-figure vases of the end of the fifth century, immediately come to mind. My point here is not to discuss their function but to note their existence as part of the atmosphere in which the Greek thinker grew up, and which would make it natural for him to conceive abstractions as women or men (according to their gender) if he wished. Besides the artistic and dramatic tradition, the literary tradition must have tended to keep personification alive: it is particularly clear that Empe- dokles and Parmenides in this respect adhere to a literary tradition which goes back through Solon to Hesiod. Words (logoi) are children of Strife (Eris) in Hesiod, partly to express their origin, partly because they are felt to be powerful independent things which go out and do good or harm beyond the control of their master; the tradition can be followed through the Just and Unjust Argument of Aristophanes' Clouds down to the fourth century-the personification of the Laws in the Crito1 is an obvious later example and a much weakened instance can be seen when Aristotle calls the "dialogue" (logos) the protagonist in tragedy.2 The large number of local personifications in the fifth century and later grows out of the very ancient beliefs in the nymphs of springs and mountains, who could easily become city goddesses and so representatives of their citizens. But in this last use we see another element which helps personification and keeps it alive: for a number of personifications persons may be substituted. When Herodotos3 says that Miletus had been sick with stasis for two genera- tions of men, the city is personified and is a person who outlasts any one generation of its citizens, but when Aeschylus4 says that all the land of Asia mourns for the Persians who have gone to the war, the land of Asia means the people who inhabit the land; similarly on the well-known Apulian vase5 of the late fourth century, which is inspired by a fourth-century tragedy on the theme of Marathon, Hellas and Asia are personifications not so much of the countries as of the people dwelling in the country. Sometimes also in the common personification of the arts in fourth-century prose it is not difficult to substitute artists or technicians for the personified art. When Plato says in the Gorgias6 that "Medicine has thought out the nature of what it is caring for," he means by Medicine something like "good doctors." Another way of making a personification plausible is to colour it by a 1 Plato, Crito, 50a. 2 Aristotle, Poetics, 1449a 17. 3 Herodotus, V, 28. 4 Aeschylus, Persae, 548. 5 Naples 3253, Furtwingler-Reichold, pl. 88. 6 Plato, Gorgias, 501 a.</page><page sequence="4">PERSONIFICATION AS A MODE OF GREEK THOUGHT 13 known legend. A clear and interesting case is the chariot drive of the soul in Plato's Phaedrus.1 The soul is personified as a charioteer of a winged chariot drawn by a good horse and a bad horse; with great difficulty the soul may perceive in its drive the Platonic Ideas dwelling in their place beyond heaven. Here three allusions would not escape Plato's audience. Parmenides had already described himself as driving to heaven to receive a revelation, and Plato has shifted the emphasis to point out the difficulty of philosophy for the ordinary man. Secondly, the audiences of Parmenides and Plato would know the legend of Herakles' drive to heaven which is common in art, particularly in the late fifth and early fourth century. Thirdly, the audience of Plato, when they heard of the Ideas in their place beyond heaven, would think of the pictures of Herakles with the Hesperides, among whom the personified ab- stract Hygieia is once included. This legend was allegorized by Herodoros, a contemporary of Sokrates, who made the lion-skin courage and the club philosophy, the serpent passion and the three apples virtue. The allegorists both re-interpreted old stories and invented new stories. In the Phaedrus myth Plato's process is similar but different: certain elements from the story of Herakles are applied anonymously to the soul and thus make the personifica- tion of the soul convincing. An example of a rather different kind where new life is given to an old personification is the personification of the star Arcturus as the prologue figure of Plautus Rudens, derived from a play written by Diphilos in the latter years of the fourth century. The belief that stars were persons or gods is as old as Homer, and both Homer and Hesiod show traces of their acting as recording angels; but from the time of late Plato and early Aristotle the stars and their complicated movements had become especially interesting, and the writer of the Platonic Epinomis made them recording angels like the Arcturus of Diphilos. Here the astronomical advances of the fourth century added new life and a sanction to a long-established personification. In all these ways Greek personifications might still be alive and vivid when the personal view of the world was no longer the normal view. Nevertheless they can be arranged in a scale of decreasing vividness; and although the sections of this scale run into one another, the scale can usefully be divided into deification, strong personification, weak personification, and technical terms. In general it is probably true to say that with a few exceptions such as Themis, Nike, and Hygieia personifications of abstracts do not often persist with the same kind of permanent and developing individuality as the Olympian gods, but are deified at moments of great and compelling emotion. Homer makes Ate the eldest daughter of Zeus when Agamemnon apologizes, and Hesiod makes Dike a daughter of Zeus because the Boeotian oligarchy is corrupt. The position of the deified elemental powers is rather different: in Homer (like Okeanos) the sun and the winds are both natural phenomena and gods who have a legendary life outside the natural phenomenon which they represent; for Helios in the legend of the Odyssey any other minor divinity who owned cattle might have been substituted. The heavenly bodies persist in legend and in worship, and science, as we have just seen, may renew their divinity. Legend naturally does not grow round the deified elements of the 1 Plato, Phaedrus, 246 ff.</page><page sequence="5">14 T. B. L. WEBSTER philosophers (to which I shall return later) but permanence they certainly had, at least in the intention of their creators. For personifications of abstracts, however (and sometimes also for natural phenomena), momentary deification is the result of some strong emotion. I think we may note very briefly three classes which I shall call devils, witnesses, and ideals. A good example of devils are the spirits invoked on the potters in the Homeric epigram' if they do not pay for the song: they are all con- nected with mishaps which occur to pottery such as breaking, bursting, over- firing, bad kneading of the clay, and damage before firing. Plenty more can be found in the names of satyrs and maenads and their kin. By witnesses I mean especially the personification of natural phenomena to witness moments of great emotion such as the swearing of an oath. Thus Agamemnon in the Iliad2 summons besides Zeus the Sun, Rivers, and Earth, to witness the oath which he swears before the duel of Menelaos and Paris. Thus also much later Sophocles' Philoctetes3 calls on harbours, headlands, meeting-places of birds, and precipices to witness the treachery of Neoptolemos, and later still the orator Lycurgus4 cries that the land and the trees, the harbours, the docks and the wells, the temples and the shrines beg the jury for help. In the Homeric passage natural phenomena are equated with Zeus as divine witnesses; in the later passages elements of the landscape are given momentary strong personification rather than divinity, but it would be unrealistic to separate them from the Homeric passage. The third kind of deification which should be mentioned is the giving of a hymn or cult to abstract ideas which are felt to be of extreme importance at some particular moment. Thus Pheme (rumour) was given an altar in 467 B.c. because the news of the victory at Eurymedon reached Athens so quickly;5 Eirene (peace) was given yearly sacrifices and a statue a little before 370 B.C., the famous statue by Kephiso- dotos of Peace holding the infant Wealth-in the early fourth century the Athenians desperately needed peace and prosperity, as is clear from con- temporary comedy; 6 similarly a great personal emotion moved Aristotle to write an epigram for an altar of Friendship which was erected to honour Plato and a hymn to Virtue in memory of his dead friend Hermias. In Euripides particularly any important idea can be called god to stress its momentary importance, not only Hope, Tyranny, and Equality but also "recognizing friends." Deification is a strong form of personification, but personification can be strong without deification. The boundary between strong and weak personi- fication is hard to define. In art the problem does not arise except in so far as it may be convenient to distinguish between figures such as Himeros (desire) and Lyssa (madness), whose attitudes show that they are participating in the action, and figures such as Health and Happiness on vases of the late fifth century, which give the atmosphere of the scene but are indistinguishable from each other except by the inscriptions giving their names. In literature, however, a distinction can be drawn between personifications in which the 1 Homeri vita Herodotea, 446 f.; R. M.

Many ethical personifications are of the former kind. Obvious instances are Infatuation and the Prayers in the ninth book of the Iliad and Virtue and Vice in Prodikos' Choice of Herakles. This is found also in the orators, e.g., Aeschines in the speech against Timarchos:1 "Do not think that the impious as in tragedies are driven by Furies who punish them with flaming torches. But the violent pleasures of the body and the refusal to be content-these fill the pirate ships, these man the privateers, these are each man's Poine, these summon them to slaughter citizens, serve tyrants, and conspire against democracy." The pleasures are Furies, persons who summon, slaughter, and conspire. So also Physis (human nature) is a person when in the well-known fragment of Euripides' Auge2 she "willed it, having no care for laws." Strong personification is by no means confined to ethical ideas. I have already quoted from Plato's Gorgias the personification of medicine as "having thought out the nature of what it is caring for and the reason for the care, and being able to give an account of each of these things." This personi- fication is helped by the possibility of substituting good doctors for medicine, but no such substitution is possible when Aristotle3 says that "tragedy grew little by little . . . and finally stopped when she had attained her nature": here the chronological sequence of Attic tragedies is viewed as a growth from youth to maturity of a human being. When, however, Aristotle4 says that "as the early thinkers advanced, the event itself made a road for them and compelled them to research" the per- sonification seems less strong but still "the event itself" is given some sort of special status by this phrasing; Plato's personification of his argument may be compared:5 it may shout encouragement or laugh to scorn, sneak away with covered head, or die and rise again. One particular kind of weak personi- fication survives through the whole period from Homer, the personification of emotions as victors, capturers, holders, or destroyers. I think there is little doubt that this use is in origin personal, and that although the metaphor is probably dead by the fifth century, yet the emotions are still believed to have some real existence apart from the person who feels; at any time emotions may be fully personified again, as we shall see when we speak of persuasive personification. At the bottom of the scale comes what I have called technical terminology. I mean by technical terminology here terminology which correctly describes a given thing, quality, or action and implies no personification but derives from the old personal view of the universe. I need only note briefly such phrases as the head or foot of the mountain, the foot of the couch, the lip of the cup. Such terms are based on a visible likeness and/or a functional analogy but come into being because the mountain is felt as a person, the "leg" of the couch may be a caryatid, the cup may be given eyes and if it has an inscription will speak in the first person. Things are personified in Homer because they seem capable of independent action.

WEBSTER to taste flesh"; the wheeled tripods of Hephaistos "go into the assembly of the gods of their own will."1 The same terminology survives in Empedokles2 when he writes of the air "longing" to enter the pipette when it is excluded by water and speaks of the "sweet grasping the sweet and the bitter leaping upon the bitter." Empedokles speaking of his elements sometimes uses per- sonal and sometimes impersonal terminology so that we cannot yet say that 'we have technical terminology rather than personification. The development of the idea of ruling is interesting in this respect. Alkmaion,3 an older con- temporary of Empedokles, explained health as a "legal equality" of hot and cold, etc., and sickness as a "monarchy" of one of them. He talks about them therefore in political/personal terms. Empedokles4 similarly speaks of his four elements with the addition of Love and Strife as "ruling in turn as time rolls round," which may reasonably be interpreted as democratic rule. Later in the treatise on Ancient Medicine5 we find "the condition in which a man is unable to rule food" and "some men have a juice ruling in their body which is an enemy of cheese." Here the personal terminology is becoming a technical terminology for assimilation and domination. It is impossible and perhaps unprofitable to decide exactly where the boundary comes between personal and technical terminology. Even in the fourth century the question remains: in Theophrastos' botany6 "plants are friendly to each other ... nothing wants to be planted near olives . . . the pine is a kindly tree." Are we to speak of technical terminology or should we remember that Theophrastos, with his belief in oikeiotes, "closeness," emphasized the unity of living things and so tended to disregard the distinctions between plants, men, and animals? Here again we find a belief which keeps personification vivid, and although some instances are more and some less vivid, it is clear that a great deal of the technical terminology of action, reaction, causation, assimilation, approxima- tion and the like derives from the personal view of the universe and retains some of its flavour. Homeric man, as I have said, was surrounded by things physical, animate, and invisible which were insufficiently understood. They all seemed to have some kind of life and so to be in some way human. We can, I think, distin- guish three attitudes, as long as we remember that no sharp boundary divided them. The early Greek might assume them to be persons; or he might per- suade himself or other people of their importance (perhaps at some particular moment) by treating them as persons; or he might explain them by describing them as persons. I want now to say something about these three attitudes. Two assumptions seem to be practically universal in Greek thought, that the world is in some sense personal and that the human mind is a person. I propose here only to speak of the former assumption. The two passages in Homer where he speaks of Ocean as the "origin of the gods" and as "the origin of all" probably show his acquaintance with Oriental cosmogonies, but this was undoubtedly an acceptable explanation as soon as the Greeks wanted to explain cosmogony. No difficulty is felt in the three different aspects of 1 Iliad, XI, 574; XVIII, 376. 2 Diels-Kranz, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, B xoo/i8; B go. 3 D.-K., B4. 4 D.-K., B 17, 27 f. 6 Ancient Medicine, ch. 14, 20. 8 Caus. Plant., III, x, 4.</page><page sequence="8">PERSONIFICATION AS A MODE OF GREEK THOUGHT 17 Ocean-to be a character in legend, to be a distant sea, to be the father of all things. In Hesiod the cosmogony is given in greater detail: first Chaos comes into being and then earth; the children of Chaos are Erebos (the dark- ness under the earth) and Night who lives there; Erebos and Night in wedlock produce the Upper Air (Aither) and Day who lives there. Lastly Earth bears Heaven, the tall mountains and the sea. Then Hesiod proceeds to Theogony proper, and feels no more difficulty in putting a completely anthropomorphic god like Zeus in the same pedigree as the tall Mountains and neuter abstracts such as Lies, than Homer feels in giving the same name to Ocean in his three different functions. In the cosmogony itself the only personal quality of the persons concerned is their power of reproduction. The assumption of a world being continues in two different directions. In the prose cosmogonies of Pherekydes of Syros, Akousilaos of Argos, and the Orphics, the anthropomorphism of the gods is fundamental, so in Pherekydes Zeus is also Zas, the principle of life, and Kronos is also Chronos (Time); Earth is given as a present to Cthonie (the goddess of the underworld) and the other elements are formed out of the seed of Chronos. Earth and Ocean are embroidered on a cloak which Zeus gives to Cthonie and his marriage with Cthonie is the prototype of human marriages. The main purpose may fairly be described as a desire to provide an account of the growth of the universe which shall form a background to a moral and religious life. The cosmogonies of the philosophers are much more interesting because they show the tendency to modify the old assumption to fit the observed facts. It seems a fair guess that Thales conceived of all things as arising from a divine water by a process of generation as in Homer; but Thales modified the assumption by substituting the less personal Water for Okeanos. Anaxi- mander1 went a stage further by substituting the Boundless for Water; but his Boundless still has the divine attributes of immortality and indestructibility and apparently not only surrounded everything but "steered everything." From it the elements were "born" but again Anaximander seems to have generalized the elements as "the hot," "the cold," "the dry," "the wet." But he speaks of them as appearing out of the mass like Homeric champions and makes them pay for their aggression like criminals in the law-court. His successor Anaximenes identified the original element with air, which was god and the origin of gods and of all things that exist, and for the first time the assumption of a world being is justified by an argument, "air surrounds the whole kosmos just as our soul being air holds us together."2 Moreover this argument attributes a new property to the world being, consciousness; it is no longer simply a generator. Therefore, Anaximenes' contemporary Xeno- phanes can put the world being into a line with anthropomorphic gods and men as "greatest among gods and men, in no way like mortals in structure or thought," "the whole of him sees and appreciates and hears," "without toil he makes all things vibrate by the power of his mind."3 As Cornford4 says, this last fragment does not suggest a designing intelli- gence planning the order of the world or providentially controlling events; 1 Particularly A 15-16, B I.

WEBSTER nor did Anaxagoras take this step. In his world the old assumption remains only in the personal attributes of Nous, which is divine because it is described in hymn style as eternal and imperishable, and personal because it has know- ledge and control. The further step is taken by Diogenes of Apollonia, who equated air with mind and god and argued from the purposive construction of the human body to the forethought of god. Thus the being which generated the world has become a mind which planned and controls the world. Much of this way of thinking survives in the fourth century. In Plato's Timaeus the universe is displayed as the creation of an artist craftsman with his eye on an external model, and although the detailed description is a myth (in the special sense in which Platonists use this word) the preface shows that the central notion of a planner is an essential assumption of Plato's thought:1 "it is difficult to discover the maker and father of this whole, and impossible to tell of him to everybody ... we provide the most probable possible account." Plato is in fact arguing from the behaviour of the individual human soul to the divine planner, but this argument from the microcosm to the macrocosm is merely an explanation of the old assumption, and the ancient terminology of generation itself survives when the divine planner is said to be a father as well as a craftsman. The planner and craftsman survives in Aristotle but has become Nature, in name at least less personal than Plato's demiourgos or god. When he justifies the study of humble animals, he says that Nature the crafts- man provides unspeakable pleasures of observation and theorizing for those who are truly philosophers.2 At the same time he speaks of nature as a planner: Nature does the best of possible things and distributes like a wise man each thing to him who can use it. Personal pleasure is still an attribute of Aristotle's unmoved mover3 and the universe moves for love of him. So difficult is it to banish a personal world being. The second attitude which I mentioned is to treat certain ideas as persons in order to persuade oneself or others of their importance. Of this I need only give a few clear instances. I have already said in another context that when Phoinix is pleading with Achilles to listen to the Greek envoys, he personifies Infatuation as a strong runner and Prayers as lame, wrinkled, squinting old women who come after her: Agamemnon has been infatuated but is now praying Achilles to listen to him; if Achilles refuses he will in turn be infatuated and meet with the disaster that attends infatuation. Hesiod goes further than Homer in personifying ideas such as Justice, Good Order, Efficiency (Arete), etc., which he regards as of supreme importance for the community: Arete lives at the end of a steep path but though she is difficult at first she is easy when she has been reached. On the chest of Kypselos (a Corinthian work of marquetry of the late seventh or early sixth century B.c.) Dike was a beautiful woman dragging along an ugly woman Adikia by the neck, beating her with the other hand; a similar scene appears on a red-figure vase of about 530 B.c., Adikia is a hideous spotted woman and Dike attacks her with a hammer.4 In Aeschylus such persuasive personifications are extremely common: "the anvil of Dike is set. Fate forges her sword. The deep-hearted Fury brings a 1 Timaeus, 28c, 29c. 2 Aristotle, de part. anim., 645a 3. 3 Aristotle, Met.

In the late fifth century Prodikos2 described Herakles' meeting with Virtue and Vice: "Virtue is a beautiful girl of noble birth, her skin clear, her eyes bashful, her gait modest, her dress white; Vice is plump and soft, her skin painted to be redder and whiter than nature; she holds herself so that she seems taller than she is; her eyes are wide open; her dress is designed to show her charms to the best advantage." In Plato's Apology3 Vice is a fast runner who catches Sokrates' accusers, and in the Phaedo4 Pleasure holds a nail in her hand to nail the soul to the body. Demosthenes5 says: "in the decision of every one of you jurors love of mankind is ranged against jealousy, justice against vice, and all that is good against all that is bad." The Cynics were particularly fond of ethical personifications of this kind and we may fittingly end this series with the dialogue first between Courage and Cowardice, and then between Continence and Incontinence, which is probably rightly ascribed to Demetrius of Alexandria.6 I have only mentioned ethical personi- fications but many others including political personifications could be added and persuasive personifications overlap with explanatory personifications be- cause the idea to be explained is felt to be so important that other people must be persuaded of its truth. Explanatory personification is obviously a useful shorthand for the artist. If he wants to say that Alkibiades has won a victory at the Olympian and Pythian games, he paints him being crowned by Pythias and Olympias, personifications of the festival period.' If he wants to say that a young man (like many heroes of New Comedy) fell in love with a girl in a procession, he paints him with Aphrodite, Eros, and Pompe, the personification of the procession.8 He can indicate time by adding figures of Sun, Moon, or Night, and place by the nymph of the locality. Lysippos can sculpt Kairos, the right moment, or Apelles can paint Diabole, slander. But all these personifications occur in literature as well as art and most of them in prose as well as poetry. In particular here I want to notice the use of personification to express a relationship between ideas, which are thereby isolated and fixed. A genealogy is the commonest way of relating personifications to one another but other forms of human relationship also occur: thus in Homer the war-god Ares has a sister Eris (strife) and a son Phobos (panic); Phobos and Deimos (fear) are Ares' grooms; and Phobos has a companion Phyza (flight).9 The family group explains that all these ideas are related to war. In the Odysseyxo the Sun has two daughters by Neaira called Lampetie and Phaethousa; mother and daughters are aspects of the sun's light which are thereby fixed and isolated and shown in their relation to him.

WEBSTER Hesiod used these patterns in the Theogony on a grand scale to equate very disparate things in a family tree; even such a superficially homogeneous group as the daughters of Ocean are found on closer inspection to contain figures of very different meaning and provenance. The family tree is also a positive advantage: Chaos is the ultimate ancestor through Night of Death, Decep- tion, and Infatuation; Earth is the ultimate ancestor through Zeus and Themis of the Seasons, Justice, Good Order, and Peace. This last group makes Themis, the right which rulers dispense, the wife of Zeus and the mother of Justice, Good Order, and Peace, the social results which Hesiod wants to achieve; they are also equated with the Seasons and are thereby shown to be as important as the seasons by which men regulate their agriculture. The point of contact here is Peace, which for a Greek includes the notion of prosperity and could easily be equated with Autumn. Much later, in the fourth century, Plato made Eros the son of Poros and Penia to explain two essential elements in the lover,' and an unknown Athenian dedicated a relief to Zeus Epiteleios Philios and his mother Philia and his wife Agathe Tyche: Success is the result of friendship combined with good fortune.2 Two early fifth-century instances show the use of personification to express difficult new ideas. Pindar begins his fifth Isthmian Ode:3 "mother of the sun, Theia of many names, because of you men count strong gold as superior to other things; because of the honour that you give, ships racing in the sea and chariot-horses in swift whirling contests win our admiration." Theia is thus the source of light and the common quality which makes gold and success in sport precious to men. Pindar has used this personification, which he in- herited from Hesiod, to convey the notion of value. Similarly Empedokles4 phrases the opposite abstract qualities which can be seen in anything physical as pairs of deities who receive the soul at birth: "Earthy and Sunfaced, bloody Strife and charming Harmony, Beauty and Ugly, Swift and Slow, lovely Truth and black-haired Obscurity, Growth and Decline, Sleeping and Wak- ing, Movement and Rest, wreathed Magnificence and Squalor, Silence and Speech." Of these Harmonia, Nemertes, and Kallisto are respectable mytho- logical figures in quite different contexts and round them the new personifi- cations are grouped. So, too, on vases from the late fifth and early fourth century Aphrodite and Dionysos are surrounded by old personifications like the Graces and Seasons but also by new ones such as Happiness, Health, Procession, Tragedy, and Comedy, all of which are in some way connected with Aphrodite or Dionysos, as concomitants or results or products of Love or Ecstasy. The artists represent them as nymphs or maenads. In the same guise Plato imagined his Ideas in their place beyond heaven or Poetry when he banished her from the Republic,5 and tragedy is personified by Aristotle when he speaks of her "growing little by little . .. and finally stopping when she has attained her nature."6 I have said that the development of Greek thought may be seen as a struggle between the tendency to personify and the tendency to schematize. 1 Symposium, 203b. 2 Marble relief in Copenhagen, Nilsson, Gesch., I, 765, pl. 38, 2. 3 Cf.

We have noticed various reasons why personification stayed alive and vivid; the most important is undoubtedly the natural feeling that something deeply moving is in some sense a person or if the emotion is strong enough a god. But if the usual use of this emotional personification is to persuade to virtue or dissuade from vice, it must also be remembered that personification has two intellectual uses which are apparent in the explanatory personifications just discussed. A general idea can be both isolated from its particulars, and put into relationship with other general ideas as child or parent or companion. Thus personification may itself be a method of rational thought; and in the fifth century when large numbers of abstract nouns came into use in every kind of thinking, their significance and their relationships were expressed by personification, weak or strong. The method had its own dangers because personified ideas seemed to have some sub- stantive reality. Aristotle saw the danger when he deprived the Platonic ideas of their independent status. But must we not say that in spite of the false assumptions and mistakes and dangers personification, in so far as it made a vaguely apprehended general idea clear and discussable, was a useful tool for the thinker?</page></plain_text>
