In this article Michael Ryan assesses the fabulous filigree decoration that is a feature of the silver paten. T he Derrynaflan Paten (Fig. 2) was found in a hoard of altar plate in the monastic site of that name in Co Tipperary, Ireland in 1980. The find was published in preliminary form in 1980 and more extensively in 1983.' The objects found included a chalice, a sieve and a basin together with an omamental hoop which has been interpreted as a foot-ring for the paten. In its restored form the paten measures 35.6 - 36.8 cm in diameter and stands 3.35 cm in height excluding the foot-ring. It is an extremely complex structure consisting of many separately manu factured components which have been elaborately assembled in a manner which would have enabled the piece to be dismantled for repair or cleaning.2 There is evidence that the object was disas sembled and reconstructed in antiquity at least twice. An assembly code of letters and symbols engraved on the compo nents had evidently been modified in ancient times. It is not intended to discuss the constructional history of the piece here - the code has been studied in detail by Raghnall 0 Floinn and the letters and a faint inscription by Michelle Brown3 - but it is important to note that decorative components have been moved from their original positions, or been found not to fit the posi tions already chosen for them and this must have a bearing on the question of whether a symbolic sequence had been originally intended by the craftsman and designer. As we shall see, if such a scheme had originally existed it is not now evident, nor does it seem to be mathematically recoverable although given the sophistication of the piece and the general tradition of paten design throughout the early church, the creators of the Derrynaflan communion plate are likely to have had something of the sort in mind. It is enough to note that the paten is essentially a large silver plate with around its rim a series of filigree omaments displayed in pairs in contiguous cast copper alloy frames. They are further embellished with polychrome glass studs, some in the familiar insular pseudo-cloisonne manner, others with cast false-relief decoration and inset metal trays of filigree. The elaboration of the filigree, the stamped omaments of the side of the paten, the glass settings, the knitted mesh of its rim and the organisation of the omament place the paten clearly within the same aesthetic as the Ardagh Chalice.4 It belongs to the mainstream of Irish style metalwork of the eighth century and is to date the most elaborate and accomplished piece to come to light from that tra dition. I see no reason to modify the view which I expressed in 1987 that the two pieces stem from the same workshop tradi tion, a phrase carefully chosen so as not to imply that they were made by the same person nor indeed on the same premises. Although that fine distinction has often been missed in recent discussion, it finds new support in the comments of Brown about the significance of the lettered assembly code.5 I also maintain that it flies in the face of commonsense to deny that the two are 'effectively contemporary' in so far as one may use the highly charged term 'contemporary' in discussing phenomena which are essentially without dating indications independent of art-his torical speculation.6 There are twenty-four filigree ornaments placed in double frames around the rim. Of these, three are abstract and the remaining twenty-one are either anthropomorphic or zoomor phic. They may be listed as follows: Zoomorphic/Anthropomorphic Two kneeling men 4; Kneeling quadruped 5; Two squatting addorsed beasts 3; Raptorial bird with snakes 1; Stag with snake 1; Interlaced snakes 2; Stag with interlace 1; Narrow-bodied quadrupeds 3; Interlace with bird-heads 1. Abstract Plain interlace 1; Interlocked peltae 1; S-scroll with trumpet devices 1. Rynne has argued that the latter described by me as abstract is to be read as zoomorphic. The omament of the panel consists of an S-scroll composed of interlocking spirals linked to the arms of miniature trisceles. The spiral endings contain pendant half loops of wire with short lengths dividing them. These, he argues, are long-snouted beasts of general Salin Style II derivation, simi lar to those on the well-known belt-buckle from Lagore Crannog and widespread in the curvilinear art of the Tara - Lindisfarne style.7 This is not entirely to be ruled out although it is worth pointing out that the wire loop which forms the eye of the beast is precisely the same as that used to render the bell-mouths of the trumpet scrolls on the panel where the motif is undoubtedly an entirely abstract one composed of peltae.8 The motifs are executed with a variety of beaded wires and rib bons of gold, together with granules. These wires are built up in combinations to form more complex structures, designed to high light detail, fill out bodies and create depth of field. The filigrees are all executed on foil on which, in some places, the motif has been previously traced by repousse or stamping. In these cases, the background foil has been cut away and the motif displayed in its frame against a further foil sheet. The technique, known as hollow-platform, is well attested on insular pieces. It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss the filigree in great detail; suffice it to say that it is highly accomplished and extends the range already known from the major pieces of the period considerably. Paired arrangements - more or less symmetrical - are the most common on the paten, six zoomorphic, one omithopomorphic and four anthropomorphic are disciplined in that way. Only two motifs represent solitary beasts - the stag with interlace and the kneeling beast, of which there are five examples. The remaining 1. THE DERRYNAFLAN PATEN. Irish, mid-late 8th Century.

The rim of the paten consists of the twenty-four framed filigree panels, which are the subject of this article, interspersed with polychrome glass studs. Three of the panels are abstract but the remaining twenty-one consist of ani mals, birds, and men. 83 IRISH ARTS REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">Tl-E MENAGERIE OF TH'IE DERRYNAFLAN PATI'EN panels depict either creatures of unlike type on the same panel - two examples - or interlaced serpents. It would seem reasonable to conclude that pattern was especially important in the design of the symmetrical motifs and that those with beasts of two different types represent - either overtly or by derivation - scenes or sym bols which had been less subordinated to ornament. The paired men panels (Fig. 1) have already been the subject of a detailed discussion by the writer in which it was argued that they derive in the main from the human figures frequently repre sented with beast motifs on the rim friezes of Late Antique silver plates from which it may be argued Christian patens derived.9 This impression is reinforced by the use on vessels in several Gaulish finds of silver of back-to-back human heads and human heads used almost as scene dividers'" Early Christian patens tended to carry complex iconographical symbols or figured scenes - the Riha and Stuma patens, for example, are well known as is the later fifth century Plate of Patemus now in the Hermitage in St Petersburg. The latter bears a rim ornament of doves, chalices and vines to which secondary settings for applied orna ments are soldered, the dished interior bears a large Chi Rho mono gram." Later medieval patens in western Europe often carry elaborate engraved scenes. The majority of sur viving early medieval western patens are small examples made en suite with grave or travelling chalices and preserved because they were placed in tombs. The sample which survives is unrepresentative. References in inventories and documents such as the Liber Pontificalis make it clear that very large patens were once fair ly common in the great churches of western Christendom and the Derrynaflan Paten is of special interest because it is the only example of its type to survive from early medieval westem Europe. The raptorial bird shares its panel with two snake-heads on a common body which forms the interlace within which it is dis played but with which it is not involved. The form of the bird is clearly dependent on manuscript representations where the gen eral type, usually and for obvious reasons, is the eagle, a symbol both of the evangelist John and of Christ Himself. While bird and beast combinations are common, I know of no other insular metalwork scene which specifically relates the eagle with the serpent. One may be an evangelist's symbol, the other ( because it sloughs off its skin) in the Physiologus tradition may represent repentance.The eagle and snake in combat is a very ancient and widespread motif in both literature and the visual arts. In the Roman world it appeared on tombstones and in medieval Christian art appears in manuscript illumination (in the Valerian Gospels, Staatsbibliothek, Munich; the Douce MS 176 in the Bodleian Library, Oxford) and on Byzantine and Romanesque sculptures. Its use as a Christian symbol can be traced continuously into modern symbolic systems. Its general Christian import seems to have been the triumph of Christ over the forces of evil.'2 The Derrynaflan scene does not portray a struggle: instead the serpents (two heads on a common body) provide an interlaced setting within which the eagle is placed. It seems reasonable to see it as nevertheless dependent on eagle and serpent combat scenes of widespread distribution. It has therefore a christological symbolism. It is not unknown else where in insular art - a very fine example dominates the head of the Keills Cross.'3 The same may be said for the stag and snake scene (Fig. 3) - the animal is not involved in the coils of the snake. The serpent does, however, rear up in front of the stag and a dependence on stag and snake combat scenes elsewhere is very likely. It is repre sented on another Irish object of the same general period, a slab from Gallen Priory,'4 but it is one that we can recognise from a number of early Christian sources depicting the combat of the stag and snake from the Physiologus tradition.'5 The mosaic of the baptistery at Messaouda in Tunisia depicts on its central panel a pair of stags flanking a tree, each with a serpent grasped in the jaws. Parallels are not common; Puech'6 however, lists a detail on the apse mosaic of San Clemente, in a Romanesque baptistery at Freudenstadt, Wulrttemberg, a wall painting at Bawit, Egypt, and on a mosaic from the Imperial Palace in Byzantium. A mosaic fragment from Carthage, now in the British Museum, also depicts a stag with a snake but Puech does not list it. The stag and snake enmity was known to the Latin fathers and St Ambrose refers to it twice in his Breviarium in Psalmos in his com mentary on Psalm 41 ('As the hart panteth for fountains of waters') and in a sermon addressed to neo phytes in which the stag is associated with baptismal imagery and the slaying of the serpent is given symbolic value. St Augustine, commenting on the same psalm, also makes the same references to the stag and serpents, the latter he specifical ly identifies as the sins; the serpents of iniquity must be consumed by those who desired the Waters of Life. In a number of liturgies Psalm 41 was recited at the vigil on Easter Saturday night when the catechumens achieved their initiation. The Mass of the Catechumens Good Friday in the Roman rite still uses Psalm 139, 2-10, 14 as the tract: 'Deliver me 0 Lord from the evil man: rescue me from the unjust man ... They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the venom of asps is under their lips.' Psalm 41 is the tract for the blessing of the font during the Easter Vigil. It was chanted by Pope, clergy and cate chumens in the early Roman Ordines. The symbolism of the stag and serpent is appropriate also to monastic life according to Puech, because the stag ejects the snake from caves and clefts in the rock just as the anchorites and contemplatives destroy their enemy the allegorical serpent. Doubtless some of the Desert Fathers had to evict the real thing too. In Ireland St Patrick had taken care of the problem. The panel depicting a stag in a field of interlace (Fig. 4) is worthy of comment. It is quite clearly an antlered beast, not a homed one. Alone of all the animal panels found in situ in its frame, it was placed so as to be read looking from the inside of The Paten is an extremely complex structure consisting of many separately manufactured components. 84 IRISH ARTS REVIEW</page><page sequence="4">THE MENAGERIE OF THE DERRYNAFLAN PATEN the plate out wards. It could be described as being inverted with respect to its neighbours. This beast has been tentatively identified by Michelle Brown to be the ibex as described in the Physiologus, an animal which fell from a height and was stuck upright in the ground.'7 I am not convinced. Firstly, its 'inver sion' on the paten may well be accidental - the result of haste in assembly or reassembly of the piece. Secondly, it may not have been alone in appearing inverted - other panels were found detached and have been replaced in their frames on the assump tion that they were read looking from the centre outwards. Principally, however, we are here dealing with a beast with a fine and clearly shown rack of antlers. Whatever about the ibex, the stag was an animal well-known to the Irish in early medieval times. It is important to note that in baptistery representations of stags, sym metrical pairs are often shown; is the Derrynaflan depiction of two a reflection, albeit confused, of this tradition? Is it simply another representation of a stag much in the manner that exam ples are depicted on near contemporary sculpture? Whatever choice one makes, the baptismal signifi cance of the stag symbol is unquestioned and its appropriateness on a dish which held the Bread of Life, the Body of the Redeemer, is obvious and need not be laboured. The stag as a symbol without serpents is well known: exam ples occur on mosaics at St John Lateran, S Maria Maggiore, the mausoleum of Galla Placidia at Ravenna and many more Christian scenes in a variety of contexts. In Ireland the stag in a trap is especially well shown on the Banagher shaft, a sculpture dating probably to the ninth century. I take the stag on the 2. THE DERRYNAFLAN PATEN.

The orna ment of the paten places it within the same aesthetic as the Ardagh Chalice and it is the most accomplished example of Irish style metalwork of the 8th century that has so far come to light. 85 IRISH ARTS REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">THE MENAGERIE OF THE DERRYNAFLAN PATEN 3.

The interlaced snakes need not detain us long. In Christian terms the serpent is an ambivalent figure. Snake forms are endemic to insular metalwork and whether we should see any thing more than conventional omament in their use is arguable. I believe that we must accept the sophistication of the artists and their mentors, but the overt use of the serpent in a symbolic way is an open question. What is not questionable is their dispo sition to form an interlaced cross and this is reflected also in the panel of plain interlace where there is a cross evident in the void created by the interlacements.'8 Some of the glass studs of the rim also repeat the cross theme. The paired motifs do not lend themselves to quite such detailed interpretation. I have suggested for some time that they are closely related to paired beast patterns, inhabited plant-scroll derivatives which seem to emerge in a secondary phase in the Anglo-Saxon province of insular art. This has some chronological value: it might be taken to suggest that the paten belongs to the later rather than the earlier eighth century when equivalent motifs make their appearance in Anglo-Saxon art. Here I must continue to declare that the taste represented by the narrow strip of panelled ornament, altemating animal, curvilinear and interlace pattems is that identified by Professor Cramp in the Durham manuscript of Cassiodorus commentary on the psalms and in the Breedon sculptures in general terms. It is not the aesthetic of the Tara Brooch and the Lindisfarne Gospels of the later seventh and earlier eighth centuries AD. This suggests to me that the paten and the Ardagh chalice belong to a later phase of the Irish tradition. Having said that, I should add that I simply do not accept that there is any preci sion in this. Far too many certainties have been claimed in the field of Early Irish art history. The plant-scroll phenomenon is, of course, explicitly icono graphical in import. I doubt, however, if we can see the entire corpus of Derrynaflan animal panels as an integrated scene, a procession of the tria genera animantium of Genesis. What I have suggested elsewhere is that the composition in a general way reflects the rim ornament of beasts found on late antique silver dishes, but this is no more than a re-emphasis of a truism about the origins of early altar plate as a whole. Individual scenes within the circle of the rim embody specific Christian themes but it is difficult to see them married to form on the paten a coherent integrated symbolic cycle.
