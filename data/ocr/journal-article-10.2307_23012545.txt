<plain_text><page sequence="1">Readers' Temperaments and Fictional Character Suzanne Keen When it comes to character, narrative theory has long been at odds with ordinary experiences of fiction reading. Characters, says the formalist or poststructuralist theorist, are nonhuman word-masses, existents, actants, narrative-men, Nobodies, or the products of semes traversing proper names.1 Yet readers persist in regarding characters as more human than "substantial hypothetical be ings," more like friends or neighbors than E. M. Forster's species Homo Fictus allows.2 This tendency shows every time regular readers talk about fictional characters, and there's really nothing that narrative theory can do to stop it. Instead we ignore it. Narrative theorists have chosen functional, thematic, and linguistic approaches to character over the analysis of readers' reports of self-recognition in fictional characters, or what might be described as naive engagement with readily identifiable character types.3 This work rarely reckons with the behavior and beliefs of ordinary readers of fiction, though it implies effects on ideal audi ences.4 For instance, in cognitive narratology, recent work on modes for representation of fictional consciousness contributes to models of narrative communication and accounts of human mind-reading ability, though the experiences of actual readers remain in the black box.5 Common readerly practices such as liking and hating characters, con necting with or distrusting characters, have been relegated to the book group or the blog, if they are discussed at all. These ubiquitous means of engaging with narrative fiction deserve attention. This essay calls for a revival of reader-response studies, informed by evidence of the high degree of variability in reactions to fictional characters. In an historical moment where reading overall and fiction reading in particular suffers precipitous declines,6 attention to what the remaining ordinary readers do with and to fictional characters could then change the direction of theoretical engagement with "character." Rather than increasing the distance between theorizing about fiction reading and the experiences of actual readers, we acknowledge the shaping influ ence of readers on character. This influence includes aspects of iden tity such as gender and class. Feminist standpoint theory suggests that personal identity influences all aspects of scholarly work, including New Literary History, 2011, 42: 295-314</page><page sequence="2">296 NEW LITERARY HISTORY reading practices, which need not acquiesce to the apparent textual demands for a compliant reading style.7 This is not simply a matter of gender, however. The pressures exerted by readers on the imaging and judging of fictional characters derive from the multiple intersecting axes of their subject positions.8 As I will argue here, the way we cocre ate fictional characters in reading also depends on inner qualities of temperament, defined as "constitutionally based individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation, in the domains of affect, activity, and attention."9 Constitutional differences involve a combination of hered ity, individual development, and experience. These contribute, in the form of temperament, an affective, attentional, and activational core to personality, which itself includes "much more than temperament, particularly the content of thought, skills, habits, values, defenses, mor als, beliefs, and social cognition" (T 100). Far from rooting responses in a biological substrate alone, developmental and social psychology complicate the picture by admitting multiple variables contributing to consistent personality traits. These temperamental differences express themselves not only in the ways people respond to other people (cau tiously, shyly, warmly, defensively, openly, etc.), but also in the way they construct imaginary humanlike persons in fictions. What would happen to narrative theories of fictional character if they admitted the full temperamental range of actual readers, and the evi dence of divergent ways that readers respond to the imaginary beings in storyworlds? Privileged reading modes (the analytical or symbol-seeking) would yield to the more numerous skimmers, skippers, and escapist immersion practices.10 Taxonomies of character types would verge on chaos, for how could narratology account for all the nontextual detail added by readers? The relative tidiness of models based on description of textual strategies would give way to messier schemas admitting read ers' variant responses to representational techniques. As a starting point, narrative theories of fictional character should accommodate evidence of readers' empathy (and other emotional responses to fiction reading). Narrative empathy means feeling with fiction." A common experience of immersion readers, a frequently, though not universally, cultivated effect of fictions, and a desired outcome of many novelists, filmmakers, and storytellers, narrative empathy features in accounts both of emotional triggers in imaginative experiences of reading and of empirical studies of shifts in readers' feelings while encountering literary texts.12 Several of my conclusions in Empathy and the Novel bear on readers' experiences with fictional characters. There I discuss the puzzle that many readers experience intense emotional fusion with narrative texts, but that no one narrative text evokes empathy from all its readers.13 It is widely</page><page sequence="3">readers' temperaments and fictional character 297 understood that readers' cultural contexts and individual experiences influence the degree of their responsiveness to the emotional appeal of texts (EN 170). This has not restrained theorists from extrapolating the profound impact of character identification and emotional fusion on readers' subsequent behavior as citizens of the world. Paying heed to readers' divergent experiences of fictional characters discourages such generalizations. Arguing against a Utopian vision of narrative empathy as a sure source of real-world altruism, I maintain that many readers experience narra tive empathy without undertaking prosocial action in the real world as a result (EN 90-92, 99). My dissent from the literary version of the empathy-altruism hypothesis as formulated by C. Daniel Batson and his research group stems from the lack of evidence for such positive impact. I also fault narrative ethics for failing to confront the potentially negative effects of vicious or Machiavellian applications of narrative empathy—that is, when narrative empathy invites shared feeling with sadists, or when perspective taking is employed to better understand a victim.14 Yet I cau tiously affirm the hope expressed by psychologists of moral development and philosophers of virtue ethics that the opportunities for character identification afforded by novel reading may participate in the moral internalization and socialization that can transmute empathic responses into prosocial action.15 However, the channeling of altruistic impulses arising from narrative empathy with fiction back into the real world requires unusual effort and direction. If novels do sometimes work to create Martha Nussbaum's "good world citizens,"16 we still know much less than we realize about which techniques effectively invite concord of authors' empathy and readers' empathy in experiences of intense emotional fusion with the imaginary experiences of fictional beings, let alone how narrative empathy might be translated into real-world altruism. From a narratological perspective, my conclusions about form and technique affirm Meir Sternberg's insight that their effects are con siderably more protean, various, and unpredictable than is generally acknowledged.17 So for instance, we have no persuasive evidence that revealing first-person self-narration evokes readers' empathy more ef fectively than extra-heterodiegetic narration by an authorial narrator, despite the very common assumption that first person is more empathetic than third person (ENxi, 33, 96). Research in discourse processing and psychonarratology has revealed just how little we can affirm about the variety of techniques that have been nominated as empathetic, though promising projects are underway.18 Understanding narrative empathy involves distinct areas of narratology: study of readers' empathetic re sponsiveness, theorizing of authors' strategic empathizing, an inventory</page><page sequence="4">298 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of what empirical research on empathetic textual devices verifies or con futes, and investigations of the impact of different modes of narrative.19 My convictions about narradve empathy thus shape my temperamental theory of character, about which I offer four propositions that map onto the subsequent sections of this essay. First, I discuss the relative roles of readers' own temperaments and experiences and authors' constructions in shaping readers' responses to character. By temperament I mean the interior qualities of a person's mind and affective style (or feeling tone), not necessarily their performative or public personality. This topic admits with some leniency a wide range of potential responses to characters and questions the notion that fictional character is entirely controlled by writers and texts. Second, I assert the likelihood, based on studies in developmental psychology, that human temperaments shape read ing more than reading shapes people's temperaments. This places the popular notion of fictional character as a means of character shaping for readers under skeptical pressure. Third, I nominate Baruch Hoch man's early cognitive theory of fictional character, Character in Literature (1985), as a bridge between formalist theories of character and practices that acknowledge the range of responses predicted by temperamental character theory. Fourth and finally, I sketch the lineaments of a practi cal theory of temperamental character, with a discussion of its classroom applications and implications for literary criticism. Fictional Character and Narrative Empathy Fictional character is a nearly unanimous nominee of fiction readers for the title role in their stories of feeling with fiction (EN 68-77). Nar rative empathy may precede character identification or work against the grain, as when readers experience narrative empathy with figures otherwise evoking dislike or discomfort (EN 74-75, 170). In my earlier studies, a focus on narrative technique has sometimes zeroed in on em pathetic aspects of characterization (as, for instance, in the rendering of facial expressions and bodily postures in comic books and graphic narratives). Fictional character, however, is not a narrative technique, but a product of it. Fictional character resides somewhere between the discourse and the storyworld, a projection of fictional worldmaking and the site of readerly creative collaboration. Axiomatically, readers are different from one another.20 The resultant divergences in how we flesh out the text's words into the illusion of persons usually fall into the great bracketed area of reading phenomena experienced but not studied, acknowledged but not sanctioned by theory. Temperamental character theory ventures into that chaotic zone.</page><page sequence="5">readers' temperaments and fictional character 299 Character causes trouble for narrative theory. It is the Mobius strip that disrupts formal taxonomies of level and function. Character is difficult to separate from plot, as Henry James announced back in 1884: "What is character but the determination of incident? What is incident but the illustration of character?"21 It is hard to place tidily when one works within narratology's story/discourse convention, for characters seem to belong to one realm (the storyworld), while characterization belongs to the other (discourse or narration). Character is frequently renamed according to the role it plays (narrator, narratee, focalizer or reflector, narrative agent—each of which may contribute to characterization). Under narrative situation's various roles character gains narratological status: we can more readily discuss narrator and narratee as characters, and characters in their roles as focalizers or reflectors, than character as the word-wrought projection of something very like a human being. Yet if character is hard to disentangle from plot, the narrated domain, and the intricacies of narrative situation, it is equally hard to confine to the textual realm, for character notoriously escapes the boundaries of the text itself, and not only through sequels and other transfictional reanimations. Ordinary readers do things to and with character that evade description by narrative theory when they respond to characters as persons. Who has not wondered what it is like for Charlotte Lucas to submit to sexual intercourse with the odious Mr. Collins? (On this subject, Austen is silent: we know only that Charlotte has chosen the coldest room in the house for her parlour.) Cognitive theories of char acter suggest that the mental models of storyworld participants depend in part on readers' general knowledge of schemas and stereotypes, including modes of social person, brought to the reading experience. Recent theories of virtual narrative emphasize the degree to which the reading of plot depends upon readers' active imagining of potential storylines that do not come to pass.22 These theories authorize the ac tive reader's content-rich projection and invention of counterfactual events and consequences—the alternative possibilities that a plot brings alive in the mind, driving reading forward. It is impossible to imagine how such virtual narratives cluster around live plot possibilities, if not through readers' imagining of the behavior of characters unbound from textual limitations. The value of these cognitive theories inheres in their description of a dynamic process that restores a position for readers in narrative theoriz ing about character. Their limitation lies in their inability to account for different results of reading, especially in different kinds of readers or audiences.23 We can label a reader as actual, implied, resisting, be longing to the narrative audience or not, but in critical practice most</page><page sequence="6">300 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of our knowledge about what actual readers do with fictional characters comes from introspection and our observations from teaching. This has an impact on our theorizing of character. Uri Margolin observes, "While the model reader and professional literati will give the literary [models] precedence, ordinary readers tend to give precedence to entrenched actual-world models."24 Ordinary readers often subscribe to a mimetic or representational theory of character that defaults to human and folk-psychological settings, even when the characters reside in fantasy lands (P 153). This does not mean that ordinary readers are honor-bound to treat characters as realistic representations of persons, though they may. James Phelan has explained how mimetic, thematic, and synthetic functions of character coexist: readers may exert consid erable influence in activating or ignoring those functions, even while adhering to the instructions of the text.25 The mix may depend more on the temperament of the reader than is usually acknowledged. And there's the unpredictable afterwards, when fictional characters called up by a finite word set persist in the reader's imagination, inviting reassess ment, creative revision, speculation, further adventures. The mimetic or representational theories of character offered by cognitive, semantic, and communicative approaches can only go so far in describing what readers contribute to character (C 52-57), and even reader-response theories dedicated to describing the dynamics of cocreation leave a lot out of the description. Bodily responses, immedi ate feelings and long-term moods, memories that distort dimensions and traits of narratives, gap-filling imagining that goes further than the textual evidence supports, and outright supplemental fantasizing: these effects of texts on readers are rarely discussed, though they may be signal qualities of what Victor Nell calls ludic reading.261 am in agree ment with the observation of psychonarratologists Marisa Bortolussi and Peter Dixon: "It is entirely conceivable that some readers impose on the text character constructions that are discordant with the text" (P 153). They go on: "There is no objective and reliable method for measuring the degree of consonance between the textual configuration and the construction, other than common sense and communal consensus," concluding that "understanding character constructions should therefore not be confused with hermeneutic, evaluative activities regarding the validity of any construction" (P153). While literary theories of character and characterization have tended in the twentieth century to de-emphasize feeling connections between readers and personlike constructs of narrative, in the same period philosophers, educational psychologists, and various defenders of the humanities have not hesitated to offer a different view. They have</page><page sequence="7">readers' temperaments and fictional character 301 embraced the readiest connections between readerly selves and Active beings, assuming that character identification invites rehearsal of moral dilemmas and out-and-out imitation (there are fearful versions of this thesis, mainly directed against video games, as well as a more hopeful didacticism) .27 They have optimistically argued that narrative empathy with fictional characters results in the formation of good world citizens (CH 90). Because "character" in the English language is something that narrative fictions and real human beings both possess, there has been a great deal of what Meir Sternberg calls "package-dealing" in contempo rary discourse about the uses of character,28 the formation of character, the correction of bad character, and aspirations for reformed character. This ought to attract narratology's attention, for narrative theorists can contribute both a precision of terminology and a disentangling of con founded concepts to this conversation. It is remarkable how rarely this happens. Even as contemporary theories of identity have emphasized its constructedness, its fluidity, and performative nature,29 character educa tion programs have advocated narrative's didactic potential. Character education is often taught in American primary and middle schools by means of stories illustrating core values, with the aim of shaping children's values and behavior, as well as supporting academic success. Between underlying human temperaments and predictable outcomes in the form of response to narrative lies a great gulf, often bridged in educational psychology by hopeful constructions of the impact of didactic tales on children and convicted criminals.30 Advocates of virtue ethics, ethicists of care, and defenders of the humanities argue that reading about characters forms (or reforms) character." The widespread dissemination of character-education cur ricula, using illustrative fictions, suggests that in K-8 classrooms, fictional characters are expected to have a positive impact on children's moral development—on their characters. Developmental psychologists and experts in outcomes assessment have begun to take on the task of evaluating these claims, with mixed results. Evidence-based assessment of character-education programs has revealed gains in academic perfor mance, but not the desired improvements in behavior, attitudes, and values.32 For instance, the story-based character-formation curriculum "Lessons in Character" was found "to have potentially positive effects on academic achievement. It had no discernible effect on behavior or on knowledge, attitudes, and values" (WWC). Younger readers may not be so malleable, or they may be deriving different lessons from their reading than the intended inculcation of virtues. Developmental psy chologist Darcia Narvaez has demonstrated that young children arrive at entirely different morals or lessons than adults when invited to inter</page><page sequence="8">302 NEW LITERARY HISTORY pret didactic narratives on their own (MTC 43-54). We should beware conflated definitions: in English a person's moral and ethical quality, the aggregate of an individual's traits, and a fictional person inhabiting a story world all go by the name of character. An accident of vocabulary does not guarantee that fictional characters exert shaping influence on readers' characters. Readers' Temperaments and Experiences versus Authors' Constructions Readers' temperament plays a larger role than has usually been ac knowledged in their responses to fictional characters. This in turn has a bearing on theories of character. The tendency in theorizing about narrative empathy has been to emphasize matches in aspects of identity and experience to explain correlations between readers' identities and their empathy for similar fictional characters. In Empathy and the Novel I demonstrate that empathy with characters does not always occur as a result of reading an emotionally evocative fiction, and that readers' empathy with fictional characters does not reliably correspond with what the author appears to invite (£7V169). Externally recognizable markers of identity are not the most suasive element, for character identification is not limited to those who match up by traits. Characters can and do invite empathy from readers who differ markedly from them in identity traits. So while it is true that readers' empathy for situations depicted in fiction may be enhanced by the chance relevance of particular historical, economic, cultural, or social circumstances, categorical identity weakly correlates with character identification and an ethics of compassion, as Patrick Hogan has argued.33 The empirical literature is nearly silent on the subject of those fiction readers in whom character identification and emotional engagement fail to occur.34 I contend not only that tempera ment should play a role in future theorizing about character, but also that it already inflects theorizing about character that does not acknowledge its influence. This happens when critics and theorists generalize from their own experiences without acknowledging the roles played by their own personalities and inward bearings in their reading habits. Psychology normally treats human character under the umbrella term personality, one basis of which, temperament, especially concerns me here. Aspects of temperament can be assessed using a wide variety of scales, many of which focus on the so-called big five categories of traits: extra version, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness.35 According to developmental psychologists Jerome Kagan and Nancy</page><page sequence="9">readers' temperaments and fictional character 303 Snidman, "A personality type is a pattern of traits, each determined by a combination of temperament, personal experience, and the contexts of daily life. Temperament makes a more substantial contribution to feel ing tone than to the public personality. . . . The developmental journey that leads to a relaxed or tense feeling tone requires a more substantial contribution from temperament than does a sociable or shy posture with others."36 Temperament begins in infancy with an inherited neurochemi cal makeup that affects the excitability of the amygdale (LST 22-3). It renders some human beings low-reactive (bold) and some high-reactive (shy), and although experience has a modest impact on it, studies in developmental psychology have shown that fewer than five percent of infants from low-reactive or high-reactive temperamental groups grow up to develop the behavioral and biological characteristics of the other type (LST 23). While not absolutely fixed, temperament prevents the development of a contrasting profile most of the time (LST 23). Three points must be underscored before tackling the application of personality psychology to narrative theory. First, the existing research on underlying temperament casts doubt on the likelihood of change from one tem peramental style to another. An introverted infant is unlikely to grow up into an extroverted adult. Second, although this school of thought is premised on the notion that all human beings possess temperaments, it is dedicated to the task of understanding individual differences. It does not seek to model a singular, general human mind. Third, most of the research in developmental psychology concerns the responses (of the infant and the older child) to the strange and unfamiliar. If we take narrative as comprising a set of devices for activating curios ity, suspense, and surprise,37 we can hypothesize that readers' tempera ment will likely play a role in their engagement with fictional events and characters, and in their responsiveness to degrees of strangeness and unfamiliarity (or their opposites). We usually handle these differences, if we acknowledge them, under the heading of tastes, which is to say, not at all neutrally. An implicit hierarchy of literary merit rests upon assumptions about the ostensible complexity of character, with sketchy and stereotyped characters engaged in predictable actions typifying despised low-brow genres and complicated, changeable, and category resistant characters populating serious literary fiction. This categorizing has been matched, at least until the recent past, by a tacit stereotyping of readers by their tastes: the sophisticated, trained reader who engages with narrative enigmas and appreciates the character who surprises in a convincing way, versus the ordinary reader who prefers that characters and plots live up to their generic contracts without disturbing deviations from the norm. We have been in the habit of thinking of these differ</page><page sequence="10">304 NEW LITERARY HISTORY ences as a matter of education, but what if they actually reflect readers' temperaments? All of this leads me to the intersection of two vexatious problems for narrative theory: first, the often-contested nature and status of fictional character; and second, the question of how much credit or responsibil ity (or blame) individual readers have for cocreating fictional worlds. If readers cannot help making people in their minds out of the limited textual cues inscribed by authors who encode characters in words, why does literary critical practice circumscribe their imaginative license? We learn early in our educations that we are not to ask how many children had Lady Macbeth. We know what we gain by this rigorous conven tion—quotable evidence over vague impressions, analysis of passages over reactions and opinions. But what do we lose by insisting on the textual nature of fictional character? When we suppress the experience of having characters come to life in our minds, what questions do we omit to ask about them, and about ourselves? Parallel questions about narrative empathy suggest the pressure exerted by textual conventions. Can we locate empathetic narrative techniques and demonstrate pre dictable responses to their deployment? Does narrative empathy work because fiction invites emotional engagement, or because readers possess certain temperaments that they impose on authorial constructs? I argue that readers' individual temperaments, in addition to their historical and cultural context, their experiences, and chance distinctions of their identities, have a little-acknowledged but profound impact on their re sponses to fictional characters. Like narrative empathy, temperamental character begins and ends within individual and unique human beings. Temperament Shapes Reading More than Reading Shapes Temperament It is reasonable to wonder what we can know about individual tem perament, beyond the low-reactive and high-reactive types discussed by Kagan and Snidman. One area in which human beings have tempera mental variation lies in the relative intensity of their empathy. In this area, individual's personalities are subject to analysis using instruments called empathy scales. The most widely used of these is Mark Davis's Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a multidimensional measure that can be used to evaluate subjects' perspective taking, empathic concern, personal distress, and fantasy empathy.38 While perspective taking, empathic concern (sympathy) and fantasy empathy ("the tendency to imaginatively transpose oneself into fictional situations" [£ 57]) most</page><page sequence="11">readers' temperaments and fictional character 305 likely contribute to a reader's receptivity to character identification, other aspects of empathy have been demonstrated to correlate with attitudes towards fiction. Low empathy subjects tend to be less gifted at person-to-person mind-reading and less fond of fiction-reading as an activity.39 High-empathy individuals are better at perceiving causal rela tions between narrated events.40 High-empathy subjects enjoy fiction while low-empathizers prefer nonfiction.41 Other matters of emotional temperament enter into the reading experience, not always in the way we might predict. For instance, Raymond Mar, the leading North American investigator of cognitive, social, and emotional outcomes of exposure to narrative fiction, has discovered that frequent fiction readers are no lonelier than nonreaders, a finding that confutes com monsense stereotypes about bookworms.42 Many more questions remain to be investigated. Does a reader's disposition alter reading choices, for mood maintenance or manipulation? If fiction reading (or exposure to fiction) has an effect on an individual's behavior (an enduring idea), is that effect strong enough to last more than an hour or a few days? A high-empathy reader is demonstrably more likely to engage in character identification: does it therefore follow that an experience of character identification on the part of a tow-empathy reader will profoundly alter his role-taking imagination? Or does the high-empathizer have to be drawn to fiction in the first place to enjoy potentially beneficial outcomes of reading fictional characters? These are all open questions. The potential outcomes of reading fictional character extend beyond character identification and imitation. They convey warnings about hazards represented by deceptive, manipulative, or malign characters. They invite safe role-playing imagining of actions that would be hazard ous in real life. They permit rehearsal of potential future emotional states and experiences, and so forth. Each one of these outcomes could refract differently through the lens of temperament, with bold and shy readers making different use of the opportunities to travel with charac ters. Though the governing principle of character education by way of fiction takes a simple view of fiction reading as formative of character and behavior, real world responses to fictional character may be more shaped by disposition than a shaper of them. Hochman's Character in Literature as an Armature for Temperamental Character How then, faced with a classroom full of students with varying experi ences of narrative analysis, should a teacher proceed? The unforgiving</page><page sequence="12">306 NEW LITERARY HISTORY regime of outcomes assessment of student learning objectives leaves little room for respecting individual differences. Furthermore, most faculty share a conscientious desire to send students along to their colleagues equipped with a toolkit of analytical methods and a rough sense of "what counts" as disciplined analysis of narrative. In the undergraduate literature classroom, this has often meant breaking students of the habit of responding to fictional characters as if they were people. I do not argue that literature professionals should capitulate to this seductive il lusion of fictional narrative, rather that they should train themselves to hear the differences in students' self-reports of responses to character. Just because one student judges a fictional character as a real person does not mean that all students in the discussion will agree. Indeed, the most heated debates in an unregulated discussion of fiction usually stem from strong disagreements about characters and whether they should be taken as people. The cognitive character theory of Baruch Hochman, outlined in his book Character in Literature, provides an armature for discussion of responses to fictional character that allows space for readers' tempera mental differences and varied opinions, but still affords a teacher the opportunity to ask for textual evidence to support students' judgments about fictional characters. Hochman offers as a sequence of juxtapositions the following pairings, representing scales of greater and lesser degree, and invitingjudgments on the parts of readers about the characters they encounter in fictional worlds: Each pairing opens possibilities for readers to make judgments about characters, supported by textual evidence, without occluding personal responses that may arise from readers' temperaments and experiences. Experience in the classroom suggests that students will make a variety of judgments about the same fictional character: some will find a character more whole, while others will see a fragmented figure; some will make a case for a stylized, symbolic reading, while others recognize a natural, literal rendering of the very same character. The point is not to adjudi cate right and wrong readings, but to invite discussion of evidence that does not preclude personal feelings about characters. In a recent MLA stylization coherence wholeness literalness complexity naturalism incoherence fragmentariness symbolism simplicity opacity staticism [inertness]43 transparency dynamism</page><page sequence="13">readers' temperaments and fictional character 307 volume, Options for Teaching Narrative Theory,44 I describe an exercise for classroom application of these alternatives to help my students think about characters as constructions made out of words, since I am invit ing them to supply textual evidence to support their judgments about characters' qualities. Hochman's multiple scales for evaluating character leave space open for actual readers' temperamental responses to fictional character. The alternatives do not embed implicit value judgments about better or worse kinds of character or better or worse responses to them. In practice, while students sometimes agree about how to categorize a character, very often they come up with persuasive cases for alternative placements of a character on one of Hochman's scales. This has obvious benefits for teaching argumentation, but it also helps me square my commitment to an analytical approach to character with my conviction that readers' responses to narrative fiction vary a great deal more than most narrative theories can accommodate. Aspects of Temperamental Character in Theory and Practice What would happen if fictional character were reexamined through the lens of temperament? Temperamental character theory would not allocate fictional characters to categories (in a manner analogous to the medieval humours: choleric, melancholy, sanguine, and phlegmatic), for that would simply replace one typology with another.45 Instead it would ask how the personality, disposition, and experience of readers filter narrative fiction for evocative cues about fictional persons. This call differs from the critical practice of reading characters through trait attribution, or humanizing characters.46 In his influential critique, L. C. Knights focuses especially on what he regards as the psychologizing errors of critic A. C. Bradley. As a consequence of this critique, genera tions of students have been counseled to attend to the words out of which characters are wrought rather than making assumptions about the personalities and lives of fictional beings. Yet the social psychology of attribution suggests that people habitually employ commonsense theories of others' behavior, often overestimating the extent to which a person's behavior is due to internal factors of disposition. Temperamental character theory would acknowledge the scripts about social persons that all readers bring to the apprehension of character,47 and it would seek ways to discern the points of contact between models of social person and textual representations. It would ask how readers</page><page sequence="14">308 NEW LITERARY HISTORY choose with or against the grain of narrative techniques and authorial intentions to construct impressions of fictional beings that sometimes obey but also sometimes escape the constraints of characterization. It would rely on the cognitive and affective psychology of intersubjectivity to account for the abundant assumptions brought to the understanding of character by readers of markedly different temperaments and tastes. It would avoid assessing readings of character as right or wrong. It would also seek to discover points of contention arising from the common deployment of narrative fiction for purposes of character education (by advocates of moral education and virtue ethics). It would consider the evidence from developmental psychological studies that show the minimal impact of environmental influences on underlying temperament and how rarely the use of exemplary characters in illustrative narratives results in demonstrably changed attitudes and behaviors. It would at tempt to disentangle what fictional character ought to be from what it actually is for readers of various temperaments. This includes our own temperaments, and they may be the hardest of all to reckon with. Our attitudes towards fictional character may indeed be vexed by contrary impulses in our own pleasure reading and ana lytical practices: this is worth examining, but we should also take care not to elevate our own temperaments—or our training—as exemplary. We might ask whether theories of character have been skewed by the population of high-empathizers gravitating towards novel reading and narrative theorizing. Has the experience of empathetic character identi fication, familiar to virtually all immersion novel readers, shaped theories of character? Overall, I think we have to say that they have not: rather the converse. Narrative fiction, broadly construed, remains committed to the project of representing human beings moving through social worlds. Most narrative theories of character operate in an arid zone that admits few readerly feelings and underplays the gap-filling fantasizing by which most readers flesh out fictional characters from scant verbal cues. Since few of us, in our teaching, are ready to go all the way with a Bleichian subjective criticism,48 this presents a pedagogical challenge for the uses of a temperamental character theory. It is certainly not meant to be diagnostic: that is, temperamental character theory should not become a process for discovering readers' temperaments through their responses to characters—at least not in the literature classroom. How, then, can discussion of fictional character allow a broader and unrulier range of responses from readers without devolving into a purely subjec tive report on feelings about fiction? How can a measure of disciplined, evidence-based analysis be recaptured for the sake of shared discussion, without reinstating the purist regime of textualism announced by L. C.</page><page sequence="15">readers' temperaments and fictional character 309 Knights? Acknowledging these challenges takes a step in the direction of developing a methodology to admit temperamental character theory to the practice of literary criticism in our writing and classrooms. Certainly, temperamental character reading can be trained away. If we adopt nonmimetic approaches to narrative in our classrooms, we may succeed in directing our students to the textual instantiation of character, to the words and phrases about paper people (SD 122-38). We can slow the immersion readers down, drag them up to the narrative surface, force them to analyze the language, and din the conventions of literary discourse into their heads. However, the emotional powers of narrativity, operating through suspense, curiosity, and surprise (PBN 259-63), will be working against this project the whole time, hooked onto the intuitive recognition of fictional characters as persons. The drive of narrativity can be contained, but not suppressed. Perhaps the time has come to wonder whether real readers' practices deserve a place in narrative theorizing. Readers' behavior and beliefs have attracted more respectful atten tion from philosophers. Philosophical study of the "paradox of fiction" questions whether it is possible to feel genuine emotion in response to a fictitious character or event (WHH 1-39), while acknowledging that readers report such feelings. Readers' testimony strongly suggests that they often feel for characters, feel involved in turns of events, even when they are aware of the illusory quality of fictional worlds. Robert Yanal summarizes the "paradox set" in three propositions: 1. Some people (we'll call them emoters) on occasion experience emotions towards characters or situations they take to be fictions, 2. Any person experiences an emotion only if he believes that the object of his emotion both exists and exhibits at least some of the emotion inducing properties specific to that emotion. 3. No emoter who takes the object of his emotion to be fiction believes that the object of the emotion exists and exhibits any emotion inducing properties.49 For philosophers, the crux of the matter lies in explaining the nature of readers' emotional responses, felt for (and with) fictional characters and their circumstances, given their nonexistence. As Yanal puts it, "We thus have yet cannot have emotions toward fiction" (PEF 12). Even though readers know perfectly well that fictional characters are make-believe, they go on caring about them, lending them the bodies that they do not possess, feeling with them in emotional fusion that paradoxically calls into embodiment a psychic corporeality vouched for in readers' own bodily responses.50 With the exception of some rhetorical narrative theory and recent empirical studies in discourse processing,51 actual</page><page sequence="16">310 NEW LITERARY history readers' behavior as a response to fictional character has rarely been addressed by narratology. Placed under a tacit ban, the unruly behavior of real readers often undermines critical consensus about the functions of textual configurations and the limits of textual cues. As teachers, we can keep the most flagrant of readerly engagements with character out of the realm of the analytical essay, sending them along to the zone of creative writing (where they thrive!), but nothing will stop readers (ourselves included) from lending extra characteristics, borrowed from the real world or from other fictions, to the matrix of character. The cognitivists suggest that we bring along and contribute knowledge structures to our reading of character; indeed, we do far more than that, when as embodied readers we rehearse our own tem peraments in our responses to fictional character. Studying narrative empathy has persuaded me that there is neither an inherent hierarchy of values invested in narrative techniques, nor a right or predictable set of responses to those techniques. The situation is kaleidoscopic: a theory of temperamental character does not simplify matters. It validates the variable, fluctuating, and irregular experiences of real readers in their encounters with character. This variety should serve as a starting point for future theorizing, not as an embarrassment to be bracketed by nar ratological models that look the other way.

Occasionally this intersected with an early form of reader-response criticism. For instance, early in the twentieth century, Arthur Jerrold Tieje theorized seven varieties of romance, four kinds of realism, and four unclassifiable genres by means of "shallow or deep" sentiment evoked by characterization. See Tieje, "The Theory of Characterization in Prose Fiction Prior to 1740," The University of Minnesota Studies in Language and Literature 5 (December 1916): 74. 46 See L. C.
