<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. 20, pp. 559-577 DAVID BASTOW University of Dundee THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM The aim of this paper is to sketch a theory about the possibility of symbolism in general; to give an account of a primary role that symbolism can play in a religion; and to argue, from the theory, that if a religion makes use of symbolism in this role, there may be a sense in which such use needs to be metaphysically validated. First, I shall propose a definition of 'symbol'. This will be a stipulative definition; that is, it does not claim to describe current English usage, but to provide a reasonably sharp tool which will be useful for my purposes. 'A symbol is a sign which is semantically non-arbitrary.' A sign is here taken to be a thing, usually a physical thing, which has meaning. It is not relevant to my purposes to get involved in the philosophical debate about the nature of meaning; so I leave that term undefined, except to say that I use the term widely enough for y, in 'the sign x means y', to range over things (and states of affairs) as well as concepts (and propositions). Signs may be semantically arbitrary, or non-arbitrary, or to some extent arbitrary (so a sign can be to some extent a symbol). This concept of arbitrariness comes from de Saussure. He explains it thus: The idea of' sister' is not linked by any inner relationship to the succession of sounds s-o-r which serves as its signifier in French; that it could be represented equally by just any other sequence is proved by differences among languages and by the very existence of different languages.' It is generally agreed that such semantically arbitrary signs have meaning because of the existence of interpersonal conventions. De Saussure says that the arbitrariness (in this sense) of linguistic signs is a reason for not using the word symbol for them, because One characteristic of the symbol is that it is never wholly arbitrary; it is not empty, for there is the rudiment of a natural bond between the signifier and the signified. The symbol ofjustice, a pair of scales, could not be replaced byjust any other symbol, such as a chariot.2 I Ferdinand de Saussure, Course in General Linguistics, trans. Wade Baskin (London, Peter Owen, 1 960), pp- 67-8. 2 Ibid. p. 68.</page><page sequence="2">560 DAVID BASTOW At this stage I wish my definition of 'symbol' to remain negative, so I do not associate myself with de Saussure's positive talk of 'inner relationship' and 'natural bond'. Later I shall describe some of the many ways in which symbols can be non-arbitrarily related to their meaning. The second delimitation is within the field of religious symbolism. I shall be concerned only with cases in which something is regarded as a symbol (in my wide sense of the term) by the members of the religion themselves; i.e. where the religion contains not merely symbols but self-consciousness with respect to their use, i.e. some concept of symbolism. So I am not concerned with what may be called the social anthropological use of the term; according to which religious objects or beliefs or practices may symbolize something which the believers are not in any straightforward sense aware of, or even something not in itself religious - so that religious practices may in this use of the term symbolize for example the implications of a kinship system, or worries about economic pressures. Examples of particular religious concepts of symbolism, i.e. concepts used within the religion which indicate awareness that symbolic (in my sense of the term) relationships are operating, would be: parable, ritual, sacramental object such as god-image, incarnation, skilful means. A symbol is a kind of sign; its special distinguishing feature, so far defined only negatively, is that the relation between symbol and its 'meaning', what it symbolizes, is non-arbitrary. How then is it related to its meaning? The generally accepted theory about arbitrary signs is that they are related to their meaning by, or have meaning in virtue of, interpersonal rules or conventions. It is true that many features of these conventions are very far from arbitrary; the grammarian shows the systematic interrelation of the conventions; the etymologist shows how the conventions originated. Nevertheless, de Saussure is right to point to the sense in which an idea, conventionally represented (in a given language) by a certain succession of sounds 'could be represented equally by any other succession of sounds'. If the link between arbitrary signs and their meaning is explained by reference to conventions, how are we to explain the link between non-arbitrary signs and their meaning? I shall answer this question in general terms first, and then apply my answer to particular cases of religious symbolism. It follows from the definition of' symbol' that there exists some relationship between a symbol and what it symbolizes, other than the relation of symbolisation. It is in virtue of this prior relationship that symbolism can occur at all. But to say so much is to say very little; some relationship can be discovered between any two things. I shall introduce my positive suggestions about types of relationship which may lie behind symbolism, by means of some examples. In Shakespeare's Sonnet 2, he likens the wrinkles of old age to the trenches dug by a besieging army:</page><page sequence="3">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 56I When fortie Winters shall besiege thy brow, And digge deep trenches in thy beauties field,.... The topic of the poem is old age (and ways of combatting it); the military image constitutes an attempt to say something about, and is in fact used as a symbol for old age. It seems to me that this symbolization is justified by two quite different types of relation. The specific comparison between trenches and wrinkles isjustified by a similarity, which is useful for the nonce, but cannot be further explored or elaborated. Other features of military trenches - that soldiers crouch in them to shelter from enemy fire, etc. - are quite unrelated to any other features of wrinkles on a person's face. In fact in this case most of us are more familiar with wrinkles than with trenches, so the comparison does not improve our knowledge of the physical nature of wrinkles. It works in the poem, if it does work, because of its unexpectedness; its superficiality makes it witty; it is a conceit, a jeu d'esprit. Other equally superficial metaphors may be more useful, such as the Buddhist idea that doctrinal beliefs are like a raft in that they are to be abandoned once their purpose has been served. This image makes the idea of provisionality easily graspable and so memorable; but those who, thinking more deeply about the provisionality claim, realize its difficulties, and its profound implications, will get no further help from thinking more deeply about the nature of rafts. The raft image is itself raft-like, in being of only limited and provisional use. (The related comparison between samsara and a river is, though, more profound, given the Buddhist 'philosophy of perpetual flux'.) In Shakespeare's sonnet, the trench/wrinkle image, which I have so far treated in isolation, could be seen in the context of a wider image, which is sketched in the surrounding lines of Sonnet 2, and appears again in the second quatrain of Sonnet 65. This is the comparison between the attacks of a besieging army and the onset of old age. This way of thinking about old age is very far from superficial. It contains the implication that old age is to be seen as an attack on the integrity of the person, coming from the outside; not part of the nature of personhood, but a contingent and catastrophic threat to it. It is an enemy, to be resisted for as long as one's strength holds out. And to go further back, or to explore the image more deeply, war and old age do not just happen to hold these many and profound characteristics in common - we do not have here just a more elaborate conceit; they both partake of the essential nature of human suffering: having its origins far beyond the control of the individual person, threatening his very survival, to be resisted doggedly but perhaps in the end hopelessly. The description just given of' the essential nature of suffering', as I called it, is only one of many possible views about the nature of suffering, and its relation to the integrity of the person. If my reading is correct, some such view 'validates' the basic imagery of these lines. It follows that if such a view</page><page sequence="4">562 DAVID BASTOW were mistaken, the imagery would to that extent be ungrounded. The question of the truth of the view lying behind a profound image does not often arise in our reading of literature; on the whole we are content to value literature for the possible views of the world which it presents; and ask of these views only that they should be plausible, illuminating; not that they should be true in a way which excludes the truth of contrasting or conflicting views. But in the field of religion such tolerance is less to be taken for granted. The relation between the war/old age image and the view about suffering which I said lay behind it, is quite different from the relation between the raft/doctrinal beliefs image and the view that doctrines are merely provisional. In the former case, the view validates the bringing together of symbol and thing symbolized, by showing how they are profoundly related to each other. In the latter case, the view provides the occasion for the imagery, but says nothing about the actual relationship between rafts and doctrinal views - that relation is left to be picked up by our imaginative grasp of the nature of river crossings. Symbols, unlike arbitrary signs, rest on some sort of relationship between the symbol and what is symbolized. I have suggested that two types of relationship may do this job; they may be called shallow and deep relationships. In a shallow relationship, symbol and thing symbolized have only one feature in common; once the point of this one feature is taken, there is no more to be learned from the symbol. Or, in an elaborate conceit, there may be two or three features; the conceit gains force from the surprising chance that the features occur together in both objects. The symptom of a deep relationship though is that there is no such limit on the benefits to be gained from the symbolisation. It is not just that there are several points of comparison rather than only one; a deep relationship is not merely a more complex version of a shallow relationship. A symbol supported by a deep relationship can be explored without end - as can, say, the meaning of a great work of art. Many writers have pointed out that some imagery invites creative interpretation; it provides an occasion for the reader or 'under stander' to explore for himself the symbolic relationship. Such an exploration may go beyond what the poet 'had in mind' - the poet's thoughts are hardly relevant, for the relationship is in no sense the poet's creation; it exists, one may say, in the nature of things. In the poetic use of a shallow relationship, the point of similarity exists independently of the poet, but the juxtaposition of symbol and what is symbolized which activates this point of comparison is the poet's doing. In a deep relationship the closeness is already there. Can the deep/shallow metaphor be replaced by some more abstract and explanatory concept? A possible way of elucidating in philosophical terms the deep/shallow distinction is to say that deep symbolism is that which is grounded on or validated by an 'essential' relationship. An essential relationship is one which is there 'in the nature of things', when this is seen</page><page sequence="5">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 563 metaphysically, as how things necessarily must be. Metaphysical propositions need not be tied to a systematic account of things in general; but, as is the case with the view just sketched about the relation between suffering and the integrity of the person, they usually contain hints of wider implications. In my third Section I shall give religious examples of such metaphysical views; but my claim in this Section implies that deep symbolism, and therefore assumptions about essential relationships, can be found outside explicitly religious contexts. (Tojudge that a symbol is deep and validly based is not in itself to acknowledge that the metaphysical proposition on which it is grounded is true; but just that it does rest on some metaphysical claim.) A symbol which is adequately grounded in this way will be rich and fruitful; but only in some directions. In the typical case, not every aspect of the symbol will throw light on what is symbolized; in the image of old age as being besieged by an enemy in war, the fact that soldiers wear uniforms is ofno symbolic significance. Similarly, arguments from analogy, which can only be valid if they rest on some real connection between the two terms of the analogy, always have to be used with caution, for they always operate surrounded, as it were, by disanalogies. Otherwise the two terms would not be distinct in the first place. II Even within the two limits described at the beginning of the paper, I do not wish to discuss all types of religious symbolism. I shall concentrate on what seems to me to be a principal role of symbolism in religions; that is, to mediate between the believer (or potential believer) and the religious Focus. ('Focus' is a term introduced by Ninian Smart' to refer to what a religion is centred round or directed towards; this may be a being- God in Christ in Christianity - or a group of beings, or a state - nibbana in Theravada Buddhism, or an absolute such as Atman-Brahman in Vedantism.) The symbol exists in the context of an ordered three-term relationship; the symbol symbolizes the Focus for the believer. The term 'mediation' in religious contexts usually indicates not merely this formal relationship, but further connotations; these rest in various ways on the postulations of a gulf between believer and Focus, which is for various reasons difficult to cross. For logical tidiness it should perhaps be made clear that since religions may have Focuses of different categories (as is evident in the examples just given), the believer-Focus gulf may correspondingly be of several different types. But for my purposes it is sufficient to point out that this gulf can always be converted into a gulf between two states of the believer: alienated from God and in harmony with him, or in his presence, or doing his will; in samsara and in 1 For example, in Ninian Smart, The Phenomenon of Religion (London, Macmillan, I973), pp. 5, 7 and passim.</page><page sequence="6">564 DAVID BASTOW nibbana; ignorant of and in full realization of the identity of Atman and Brahman, etc. So there is a gulf, which is from the believer's point of view unsatisfactory; he looks to his religion for his salvation, that is, to make possible the crossing of the gulf. In some religions the movement to cross the gulf is made by the Focus, in others by the believer; and sometimes movement of both terms is thought necessary. As we are here concerned with those cases in which the gulf is crossed by means of a symbol, we can reformulate the three-term relationship in terms of users of the symbol: the symbol may be used, for the purposes of mediation, by the Focus, the believer, or both; or, as will be seen below, by a religious teacher. In the first case, the Focus must, to itself use a symbol, be personal, at least in part of its nature. He presents himself to the believer, not directly (this is forbidden by the nature of the gulf), but through a symbolic medium which the believer can relate to, understand. In general this latter requirement is satisfied by the symbol being something within the believer's world. (This will apply also to the cases considered below in which the symbol-user is not the Focus.) Usually 'the believer's world' is the world of ordinary experience; though in some cases it is expanded to include, for example, the special experiences which are brought within the yogin's range by his mental training, or the paranormal but still world-referring experiences of visions, etc., which some Christians lay claim to. Those extended and narrative religious symbols which are sometimes called myths, are stories about this world, or a world which can be imagined by extrapolation from this world; the protagonists are mentally if not physically anthropomorphic, their actions motivated by rage, love, pride etc. More problematic than the relation between symbol and believer is that between symbol and Focus. In the case under discussion, this is twofold; the Focus uses the symbol, but also of course the Focus is the 'meaning' of the symbol. The Focus uses the symbol to present himself (in some sense) to the believer. For the symbol to be a symbol of the Focus, there must, as I have argued previously, be some not merely conventional relation between the two. What this relation might be I shall discuss in my final Section; one simple example of such a relation could be that the Focus is the creator of what can be used as a symbol of him. The Focus's use of the symbol may amount to no more than his availability to the believer through--this relationship; but it may involve a specially intended act of self-presentation - or special 'revelation', as it is more usually called. It seems that such epiphanies may themselves make deep or shallow use of their symbols, or wordly vehicles. In the story of the burning bush (Exodus 3.2) it seems that is is only the strangeness of the bush which burns and is not consumed, which is used by the angel of the Lord to attract Moses' attention. This strangeness symbolizes the 'otherness' of God; 'the place on</page><page sequence="7">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 565 which you are standing is holy ground'. But nothing more is made of the specific nature of the symbol. At the other extreme, nothing could be more profound than the sense in which God is in Christ. The situation in the great epiphany of Bhagavad G-ita XI is complex (and controversial). The Lord shows to Arjuna his 'divine form' (riupam aisvaram); to see this is to see the Lord, presumably as to see a person's body is to see that person - not a symbol of the person. But the contents of the vision include images which do seem symbolic; the 'mouths with jagged ghastly tusks' which consume the warriors, the flaming mouths which devour 'worlds, universes, everything' (v. 30), represent, as Arjuna surmises and Krishna confirms, Time the destroyer. Is the Lord here graciously making use of, presenting himself through a symbol, for Arjuna's benefit? Or perhaps this visual symbol of Time is introduced for the benefit of us, the readers of the Bhagavad Glta, who do not have the 'heavenly eye' which Arjuna was given. Another use of religious symbolism is by the religious teacher. This can occur whether or not the Focus is itself personal. The teacher knows more of the Focus than does his pupil; his use of symbolism in his teaching may involve the shallow or the deep kind; though the latter will be possible only if there is some essential relationship between the Focus and the world, or at least that part of the world which constitutes the symbol. The teacher's aim is to make the Focus intelligible or in some other way accessible to those whom he teaches. He may communicate his saving knowledge not in an abstract doctrinal form but in the more concrete form of a symbol. 'Saving knowledge' here needs to be taken in a wide sense; what is typically communicated by religious symbols is far more than facts about the Focus; more important may be that approach of the believer to the Focus which can only come about through an emotional or volitional re-direction on the believer's part. All these types of learning may result from hearing, for example, the Prodigal Son parable, or the stories told by the Buddha in the Sutta-pitaka, and told and/or acted out in the Jataka collection. In many of these cases where the teaching model is the appropriate one, the communication is not essentially symbolic; the truths could have been communicated in abstract doctrinal formulae; and in the Buddhist cases usually were. The stories are told for heuristic reasons; to add more force to the teachings, to catch the hearer's interest and bring the message home to them. But it may be that some religious teachings are essentially symbolic; literal language cannot suffice. This is one way of taking Steven Collins' valuable argument about the place of the image of homelessness in Theravada Buddhism.I The householder who abandons home and family and goes forth to lead the homeless life of I Steven Collins, Imagery and Thought in Theravdda Buddhism (Cambridge University Press, I 982), section 5-3</page><page sequence="8">566 DAVID BASTOW the bhikkhu is doing something which not merely has the practical value of ridding him of the distractions of home life, but also has symbolic value. He is acting out, as his teacher before him acted out, a symbol which points beyond itself to the later stages of the path, and to the final realization of no-self, the abandonment of all one's possessions and securities, including even the notion of a self who could have possessions. On the positive side also the freedom from family and social and economic ties of the homeless wanderer points symbolically forward to the freedom of the arhat, whose path can no more be traced than the flight of the bird. Collins claims that this image is fundamental to Theravada Buddhism; the full significance of the Buddhist way cannot be appreciated without it. Here the teaching is by example as well as by doctrine and precept; and fully to profit from the teaching it is not sufficient merely to entertain the idea of homelessness, as one may mentally appreciate a metaphor in a poem; the symbol is a thing to be done. If the image is in this way indispensable, it is only the monk, that is, someone who has actually taken the practical step of leaving home and family, who can appreciate fully the truths which this symbol mediates. Going forth into homelessness is not merely the first part of the Buddhist way; it is a deep symbol of the way as a whole. In the primary Buddhist cases it is the Buddha himself who is the teacher; but Buddhist art provides examples in which the symbolic intention belonged to the conceiver or designer of the sculpture or architecture. Thus the typical form of the stiupa is a pedagogical device, with carvings of the multifarious world on the outside; and unembellished purity of form at the centre; representing and bringing home to the pilgrim the contrast between samsara and Nirvana, but also the possibility of a journey, spiritual rather than physical, from the one to the other. My third type of symbol-user is the believer, or potential believer, himself. In the first two cases he has been the beneficiary of the use of symbols by the religious Focus, and by the religious teacher. But religions and the forms they take can also be seen as the products of initiatives taken by people looking for the saving truths; so symbols can be seen as tools used by searchers for salvation; by people trying to understand the glimpses of the truth which have been vouchsafed to them. This is the picture of the study of religions conveyed in the title of the TV series "The Long Search". There is an analogy here with some uses of scientific models; theoretical hypotheses, claiming to explain observable regularities by describing the unobservable entities or processes lying behind them, often do this by likening the unobservable to some phenomena known at the observable level. Thus in the kinetic theory of gases the gas molecules are compared, at one level of sophistication, to hard lumps of matter such as billiard balls, shooting around in straight lines and random directions. Thus theoretical scientists may use symbols or models to represent to themselves and explore the nature of the</page><page sequence="9">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 567 unobservable entities which are crucial to their explanations. A familiar idea in Christianity is that the Old Testament relates the Jews' various attempts to discover or describe to themselves the true nature of their God; to some extent this history can be seen as a search for the appropriate images or symbols. Is God to be seen as a tribal king, a lawgiver, a creator, a suffering servant, a father? And this has been one of the ways in which the Hindu Tradition has understood its own multifarious theogony. In both religions the images may be seen as complementing rather than competing with one another. It will be typical of these tentative moves towards a religious symbolism, that the believer will be looking for symbols which are revelatory, or 'deep' in my sense. He will be dissatisfied if the symbol rests on a mere coincidence of properties; if God can be said to be kinglike because both are powerful, but the comparison loses point or becomes misleading as soon as one begins to ask about the kind of power wielded, or its source. In the scientific case, some models are mere heuristic devices, which enable one for example to grasp a complex logical or causal relationship by analogy with an easily visualisable physical shape. But others are more than this; they work because of a genuine common ground between symbol and what is symbolized, as one might say that the same forces are at work, the same laws of dynamics apply, to the imagined billiard balls colliding with the sides of the room, and to the gas molecules colliding with the molecules making up the sides of the vessel, according to the kinetic gas theory. But here, as in the religious cases, opinions may change. As one probes deeper, a symbol or model which seemed revelatory in the one case, or to manifest a genuine common structure in the other, may fail to cope with new demands made on it, and so may come to seem merely superficial. In the religious context this can happen to the symbols which the religious innovator has found for himself, in his attempt to capture his vision of the truth, to present it to himself in some way; he may himself become dissatisfied with them. But also the believer who inherits symbols of the Focus as part of the religious tradition may find them inappropriate to his new situation, and so not profound or fundamental, as had been thought. III In my final Section I wish to give some examples of religious doctrines which, in various ways, may provide grounding for the mediating use of symbolism within the respective religions. My main aim here is to outline possible connexions rather than to attempt definitive characterisations of religious doctrines; all the doctrines I shall mention are open to various interpretations. I shall concentrate on two types of relationship between the world of experience and the religious Focus, and therefore between symbol and what</page><page sequence="10">568 DAVID BASTOW is symbolized: doctrines of creation, and what may be called idealist/illusionist doctrines. If the world is created by the Focus, then it should, one may at first think, reveals his nature as clearly as a potter is revealed by his handiwork; the world as a whole and in its details should be an inexhaustible source of symbols for the creator; the more so, if the creation is ex nihilo. But as the relationship between God and the world is seen to be more complex (as in the Christian doctrine of the Fall), so the availability of symbols becomes more problematic. So within Christianity, attitudes to symbolism may well vary, with different emphases in the understanding of creation. To talk of creation is in itself to use an image, and one capable of many different metaphysical articulations. There are perhaps two main variables within the Christian tradition: firstly the degree of ontological distinctness between the creator and his creation, i.e. whether creation doctrine is near to or far from emanationism; and secondly the effect on this original ontological relationship of man's sin, or willed self-distancing from God. In general, the closer the creator is to his creation (in virtue of either or both of these variables), the more appropriate will it be to look within the created world for symbols of God (in the deep sense which I have described); and the more emphasis will it be possible to place on general rather than special revelation. The persistent Christian tradition of seeing God in the objects of Nature must rest on and imply the idea (to use a term not infrequently invoked by writers on Christian symbolism) that God participates in the world, in such a way that he who most deeply contemplates and seeks to understand the natural world - even in its most particular detail - will be made more and more aware of God's nature, and/or of his reality and presence. On this way of seeing the world, its divine significance is in exhaustible; an indication, on my earlier argument, that we here have examples of deep symbolism, and of essential relationships. At the extremes of deism, on the other hand, the relationship between creator and creation is not such as to allow this richness of interpretation of nature; it is perhaps possible to draw abstract propositional conclusions about God's attributes from the formal structure of the universe, but its contingent details are not seen as revelatory. One deeply thought out articulation of the richer relationship between God and his world is the theory (obviously Platonic in its origins) of Coleridge; this is described, in terms pertinent to my purposes, by Sister Mary Jadwiga Swiatecka in chapter 2 of The Idea of the Symbol.1 According to Coleridge, natura naturans is the creative dynamic Idea behind or at the ground of every natural object; this informing Idea springs from and manifests God who is Reason, and who is therefore also constitutively present in the mind of man. So when man looks properly, using his God-given capacities, at the I M. Jadwiga Swiatecka, 0. P., The Idea of the Symbol (Cambridge University Press, I980).</page><page sequence="11">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 569 objects of nature, he sees not merely their superficial appearance, or their external relationships, which can be grasped by the Understanding, but beyond these to their inner significance. At first level, this meaning is the idea itself; but this can in its turn be taken as a living symbol of the divine Reason from which it derives. Coleridge contrasts this relationship with the accidental similarities which lie behind 'mere simile'. I seem to myself to behold in the quiet objects [of Nature], on which I am gazing, more than an arbitrary illustration, more than a mere simile, the work of my own fancy. I feel an awe, as if there were before my eyes the same power as that of the reason - the same power in a lower dignity, and therefore a symbol established in the truth of things.' Coleridge's scheme implies a close ontological relationship between creator and creation; as close as that between reason and the (rational) ideas it produced. But the Christian view of the world must accommodate man's potentiality for rebellion, what was earlier referred to as willed self-distancing from God; the world manifests the consequences of the Fall. These effects are primarily on man himself; but also on the world in general, in so far as its new ordering (though not of course its substance) is man's handiwork. On this view, to look to the world for symbols of God is to look behind the appearances to the inner reality of things, which is how God intended them to be. The Romantic reverence for Nature will thus rest on the view that in those parts of the world which have been least affected by man's activity - the countryside, and especially wild and mountainous regions, or the natural flora and fauna - the real God-intended nature of things, what Coleridge called their Idea, will lie closest to the surface, as it were; closest to the appearances. Man himself is made in God's image; in other terms, a man's true self is God's vision of him, God's intention for him; but usually this true self is far to seek, far distant from what the man has made of himself. Some Christian writers have managed to communicate a vision of the world including the human world as it should be, and in this sense really is. Such a world is pervaded by its divine significance. Thus Thomas Traherne in his poem 'Wonder': ... The World resembled his Eternitie, In which my Soul did Walk; And evry Thing that I did see, Did with me talk. ... The Boys and Girles were mine, Oh how did all their Lovly faces shine! The Sons of Men were Holy Ones. Joy, Beauty, Welfare did appear to me,. 1 S. T. Coleridge, The Statesman's Manual, quoted in Swiatecka, ibid. p. 54.</page><page sequence="12">570 DAVID BASTOW Many of the novels of the nineteenth century Scottish writer George MacDonald have as their theme people's gradual discovery of the 'real' world and their true selves; sometimes as a rediscovery at a deeper level of a vision (like Traherne's) which was lost with the innocence of childhood. The intention of such writers is that we ourselves should journey toward such a vision. MacDonald gives us anticipatory glimpses of it through those of his characters who have already 'found themselves' (for example David Elginbrod in the book of that name). Another strand of Christian thinking, different in emphasis from the above though not incompatible with it, focuses on the transcendence of God, on the distance or radical difference of category between what we see around us and the God to know whom is our salvation. This emphasis at its extreme puts the entire weight of mediation on God's special grace, as manifested supremely in the Incarnation. The symbolic significance of the world, Nature, apart from Christ's entry into history, is correspondingly deprived of importance; but it is difficult to see how this importance could disappear completely without giving up the doctrine of creation and embracing some form of dualism. Certainly if the natural world were the creation of the devil, we would look to it in vain for deep symbols of God. But in all Christianity the central symbol of, way of approach to God, must be Jesus Christ. Christ is God, but is also a symbol of God; in fact his role as a symbol is validated by the closest of all essential ontological relationships, that of identity - though a mysterious kind of identity. So there is no limit to his symbolic power; every aspect of his life is significant. To get at the meaning, interpretation is necessary; but such interpretation, undertaken for example in sermons based on Gospel texts, is not a matter of translating a code, but of exploring the inner nature of the symbol; of Christ's homeless life, say, or of his death on the cross. No simple account can be given of the types of symbolic relationship to be found in the Indian traditions. As in the case of Christianity, but more so, all I can do here is to give a schematic account of some main possibilities. I shall discuss the relationships implicit in what may be called the tradition of saguna Brahman, the absolute with properties; and that of nirguna Brahman, the absolute without properties. The issue between these links with my earlier account of the symbolic possibilities following from various kinds of creation doctrine. The question is whether or not the world can properly be seen as a source of positive symbols of the Focus. An idea which is found throughout the Upanisads is that the Self, or Brahman, brought forth the world (sarvam idam); in such a way that he became what was thus brought forth or emanated; he 'entered into it right up to the fingertips'. (Brhadaranyaka Upanisad I. iv. 7.). The implication of this, as is vigorously argued by Pratima Bowes in The Hindu Religious Tradition, chapter v, is that 'everything here is real, and it is real because</page><page sequence="13">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 57I it is an expression of Brahman'.' The ontological relation here is closer than in the Christian creation doctrine; but as there it is a relation which can well support religious symbolism. In principle, any created object can lead the believer towards that of which it is a manifestation. Of course, it has to be looked at in the right way: 'The man who reveres any of these (breath, voice, eye, ear, mind) individually has no [right] knowledge, for He is incomplete in any of these individually'(Brhadaranyaka Upanisad I. iv. 7.). That is, the individual aspect of the world must not be seen in isolation but as part of the unity which gives it its meaning. The same idea, I think, lies behind Yajiiavalkya's great discourse: Mark well, it is not for the love of a husband [etc.] that a husband is dearly loved. Rather it is for the love of the Self that a husband is dearly loved (Brhadasranyaka Upanisad II. iv. 5.). Husbands (and all contingent beings) are to be valued as symbols (in my broad sense) of the absolute which informs and sustains them, constitutes their reality. Some worldly things may be especially appropriate for this symbolic task. Their value may be immediately recognisable, as is that of the wife to the husband, or the husband to the wife; this worldly 'dearness' points towards the absolute value which lies behind it. Or it may be the unity or wholeness of the symbol which is especially significant - a unity transcending multi plicity, as in the emotional or physical union of man and woman, or the human body itself, while it is informed by life. These special emphases do not indicate shallow symbolism based on one contingent point of similarity; the saguna Brahman view of the world implies that at the deepest level of reality each wordly object is none other than Brahman itself. The more one penetrates to the true nature of the object or person, the closer one gets to the religious Focus. This relationship is of course made use of in yogic contemplation of the 'support object'. (The substantial link between the symbol and its ground may be articulated in the causal notions of satkarya and evolution; the yogin may as it were reverse the process of evolution in his penetration towards ultimate reality.) So far my account of the saguna Brahman tradition has been rather abstract and upanisadic; the world is more obviously a source of rich and detailed religious symbolism for theistic devotionalism. There are many levels of symbolism here; the gods themselves are symbolized by their iconographic forms, their bodily shape, facial expression, vahana etc; thence by the mental images of these forms which are cultivated and contemplated by yogins; and also by the individual physical likenesses (statues or pictures) through which the gods are worshipped in puija rituals in home or temple. 1 Pratima Bowes, The Hindu Religious Tradition (London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, I977), chapter v.</page><page sequence="14">572 DAVID BASTOW The gods may themselves be seen as ideal symbols, of the unitary reality spoken of in the Upanisads; here the validating relationship between symbol and Focus will be the upanisadic doctrine already described. But is it still this doctrine which pervades the world downwards as it were, and makes possible the lower-level relationship between clay or wooden statue as symbol and god as symbolized Focus? There will be no simple or unitary answer. The high gods have cosmic dimensions, variously expressed in creation doctrines, which put them in appropriate relations with the world within which the symbols are formed. The mother goddess's close association with the earth makes possible 'earthy' images. Gods with more limited and specific roles may be present in the world, and so in their images, not as creators but as principles or powers - as Agni is present in all fires and therefore present in statues surrounded by carved flames. It should be noted that the 'therefore' in my last sentence is problematical. If a god is with justification present in x, why does it follow that he will also be present in y, which is not x but in some ways looks like x? Books on iconography often use the phrase 'by association' to explain this shift. The phrase suggests a causal psychological explanation; but such an explanation does not provide what would from the believer's point of view be a justification. Why should anyone accept what Ninian Smart calls the principle of likeness: 'where two entities or occurrences are relevantly alike in respect if some sign, they possess the same power"? It seems to me that a satisfactory answer would have to be in terms of some view about the nature of the world. What such a metaphysics would be, I cannot say. If Brahman is nirguna, the discriminated nature of the world of ordinary experience tells against its ultimate reality. (I use nirguna as contrasted with and incompatible with saguna, though this may not reflect upanisadic usage.) The extreme of this way of thinking is the idea that the world is illusion; this would seem to imply that it cannot be a source for rich symbols of the Focus. The position is formally similar to the possibility mentioned earlier, that the world is the creation of the devil - how could it then provide deep symbols for God? There would presumably be no obstacle to its providing shallow symbols, for these are in no need of metaphysical validation. I shall briefly consider, in the context of this problem, two apparent examples of illusionist doctrine: Sankara's advaita vedanta, and the Mahayana Buddhism of the Lotus Siutra. Safikara talks about one kind of religious symbolism, and himself uses another type; the two occur at different places in his system. On the one hand he supports (at one level of truth) a doctrine of creation or divine self manifestation, and allows it to validate a complex tradition of religious symbolism in the way described in my remarks on the saguna Brahman tradition. On the other hand, he himself, when explaining at the level of 1 Ninian Smart, op. cit. p. 88.</page><page sequence="15">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 573 absolute truth what true reality is, and how it is related to the creative world, the creative deities, or even more abstractly the unitary creative principle, also uses images taken from the world. These are sensory illusions of various kinds: a person seeing a rope as a snake, the delusive experiences of the dream state, the intersubjective delusion produced by the magician or mass-hypnotist. For beings at a low state of spiritual advancement, ordinary religious practices and thoughts are appropriate.1 Though even at the lowest level it seems that the believer must have some idea that the symbols are there to be transcended; that they 'manifest the Lord'. The contemplation of the Lord as manifest under illusory forms relieves the mind of its burden of attachment to the grosser and more oppressive phases of the world appearance, in particular to the objects of crude sense-enjoyments.2 The 'illusory forms' of the Lord's manifestation will be of the various categories described earlier - distinct deities, avatars, rituals addressed to them, their names, statues etc. In Brahma-Siitra Bhasya iv. i. 5, Safikara speaks of the religious function of thinking of and worshipping a god such as the sun god Aditya; superimposed on the thought ofthe god is contemplation of that of which the god is a symbol, i.e. Brahman; so fundamentally it is Brahman that is meditated on. (The relationship here between symbol and what it signifies is said (Brahma-Siutra Bhasya iv. i. 6) to be analogous with the lower level relationship between the elements of sacrificial ritual and the god which these elements represent.) gafkara also makes the point (Brahma Siutra Bhasya iv. i. 4) that Aditya etc. are effective as symbols of Brahman only when they are seen as modifications (vikara) of Brahman; this indicates that such symbol-using religious practices take place within the framework of a kind of creation or manifestation doctrine - if though such doctrines are transcended, so is the efficacy of symbolism, for the necessary distinction between symbol and thing symbolized then disappears. So far, then, the validation of the symbolic relationships is not essentially different from that within Christianity. But of course Safikara puts this type of religion within a metaphysical context which changes everything. For the creation doctrine is ultimately an illusion. The symbols which are of fundamental importance for Sanikara are those which he uses to explain this idea. That is, he explains the transcendant status of Brahman vis-a-vis the world of ordinary experience by referring to the contrast between veridical and illusory perception. Is this a shallow or a properly validated deep symbol? The analogy with sensory illusion is articulated in various ways and at 1 A. J. Alston, Sartskara on the Creation (A Samkara Source-Book, volume iI) (London, Shanti Sadan, I980), pp. 68-9. In what follows I use Alston's translations of Sanskara, and sometimes, as here, Alston's own summaries of Sankara's views. 2 Ibid. p. 68.</page><page sequence="16">574 DAVID BASTOW more than one level. At the first level, the Lord as creator does not really create, but can be compared to a magician, a mass-hypnotist performing the Indian rope-trick. But then, at the second level, even thinking of the Lord as magician is not the real truth; there is really no Lord imposing illusions on an audience. Or, at the first level, we may think, as in the Samkhya system, of the individual's mistake about his true nature, confusing through avidya his true self with what is not himself, and thereby conjuring up the illusory empirical self- the 'I' with a body, emotions, a history, etc. But again at the second level there is really no not-self for me to confuse myself with, any more than an individual 'me' to do the confusing. In fact the very existence of the individual self is cognate with the confusion between the Self and the mistakenly projected not-Self. Safikara, as a religious teacher operating in the philosophical mode, needs to explain the sense in which he is using the ideas of reality and illusion in his pronouncements at the level of absolute truth; for this he uses his fundamental epistemological tool, the concept of superimposition (adhyasa). The concept is explained especially in Brahma Suitra Bhasya I. I. Intro duction. The definition is: '[superimposition] is the false appearance in one place of what has previously been seen at another place, of the nature of a memory'.' Safikara mentions other more abstract definitions, but says that they all come down to the kind of mistake which occurs in sensory illusion: 'nacre appears as silver', etc. Now it is obvious that the initial 'mistake', whereby from the non-dual absolute is projected an illusory 'not-self', is not literally a product of sensory illusion; so Safikara must be claiming that sensory illusion provides a symbol for, or perhaps more specifically an analogy for, this original mistake. In fact the analogy is pursued; later argument about the nature and possibility of the original superimposition takes the form of pointing out the possibilities in the field of sensory illusion. The point that an argument by analogy needs to rest on some real and relevant relationship between the terms of the argument, is a special case of my general claim about the validation of symbolic relationships. Given that the world within which sensory mistakes occur is as a whole illusory, can such validation be provided? Alston, though not addressing himself precisely to this problem, indicates one way in which Safikara might answer. Every doctrine that aims, like Samkara's, at transcendence of all plurality, is perforce practical and pragmatic in character. Its details are not ultimately and absolutely true... In the end any theory of nescience is itself nescience, and nescience is not rationally explicable.2 1 Translated in A. J. Alston, Samskara on the Absolute (A Samkara Source-Book, volume i) (London, Shanti Sadan, ig80), pp. 94-96. See Alston's discussion, ibid. pp. 62-8. 2 Alston, op. cit, vol. i, p. 93.</page><page sequence="17">THE POSSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM 575 Is this any more than an admission of incoherence? To justify the use of a doctrine (in our case, a set of images) by saying 'it works' is surely to beg the question 'because of whatfact about the nature of things does it work?'. In Safikara's own example 'we say "This will make your hair grow" to recalcitrant children when we want to induce them to drink milk'.' But we do this because of the fact (alleged) that children will willingly do what they think will make their hair grow. Safikara does have an answer to the question 'Why does the creation doctrine work?' The creation doctrine validates, as we have seen, the symbolism of the creator gods, and of their creations used as ritual objects etc. But also the creation doctrine itself, the account of a casual dependence of the world on the absolute, is validated by the actual metaphysical dependence of every (illusory) thing on Brahman - for Brahman is all that there is.2 But our problem is rather 'why does the adhyasa doctrine work?'. Does the world contain intimations of its own insubstantiality? Further, if it does, can such intimations be shown to be, not merely necessary features of the world, but necessary features which rest on, and therefore reflect, that insubstantiality? That is, does the world, contain sensory illusions because it is itself an illusion? Alston translates a passage from the Gaudapada Karika Bhasya which provides material, of a kind, for answers to these questions.3 The basic idea is that if all human experience is merely the Self imagining distinctions in Himself (an idealist thesis), then it is quite comprehensible that some of these imaginings will be law-governed, intersubjective (as Safikara says, 'belong to two times'); whereas others will be 'daydreams and other spontaneous phenomena (such as errors and hallucinations) limited to the time when they are imagined'. The fact that we experience dreams, illusions etc. thus follows in a way from the fact that all experiences are merely imaginary - perhaps as the fantastic things that happen in some films follow in a way from the very nature of films and the way they are made. A more forceful version of the argument is that of the Antinomies in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. It must be said, though, that for Safikara the idealist account of 'the Self, the great divine luminous principle, Himself imagining Himself in Himself as having [these] distinctions'4 (i.e. the distinctions of the world of ordinary experience), is itself only a half-way house to the truth. Why should the Absolute, when considered at the ultimate level of truth, go in for such imaginings? If [Sanikara] sometimes spoke even of the ordinary objects of waking experience as mental, this does not mean that he thought that subjective idealism was a 1 Alston, op. cit, vol. iI, p. 66. 2 Alston, op. cit, vol. iI, p.

II, p. 223.</page><page sequence="18">576 DAVID BASTOW philosophical position that could be sustained on the basis of perception and inference.1 The religious use of symbolism is much more straightforwardly integrated into the teachings of Mahayana Buddhism; in fact, according to the Lotus Siutra, as explained by Michael Pye in Skilful Means,2 the religious use of symbolism may be said to be the teaching of Mahayana Buddhism. For example, the Buddha addresses Sariputra: ... The buddhas in times past, by infinite, numberless tactful ways [skilful means] and with various reasonings and parabolic expressions, expounded the laws [the Sanskrit equivalent is dharma] for the sake of all living beings. All these laws are for the One Buddha-vehicle, [so that] all those living beings, who have heard the Law from the buddhas, might all finally obtain perfect knowledge.3 That is, Buddhism contains many apparently different and even incompatible teachings. In particular, three are mentioned; that of the sravakas (the Hinayana 8-fold path to nirvana), that of the pratyeka-buddhas, and that of the bodhisattvas. All are teachings of the Buddha (of one and all of the infinite buddhas); and the hearer is right to listen to and follow the teaching which comes to him, with his personality and in his context - for example to aim at and achieve arhatship. But the teachings received by the Hinayana and Mahayana schools are different from each other only in appearance; really there is only 'One Buddha-vehicle'. The nature of this One vehicle is inexpressible, is understood only by the buddhas; nevertheless, this transcendent truth is the purport of the Lotus Suitra. It is, precisely, that the truth is transcendent, that all the teachings of Buddhism are skilful means. The arhat (or, for that matter, the bodhisattva) is not really what he claims to be unless he realizes this, and thus transcends his arhatship, sees it as of merely provisional, relative worth, does not cling to it. His achievement stands only if he is aware that it cannot stand, is insubstantial. Thus the innumerable skilful means used by the buddhas point towards, symbolize, the final truth expounded by the Lotus Suitra. To raise the question which has been central to this paper: how can they do this, how can the merely worldly be a deep symbol of the Focus? By their very nature as symbols are they fitted to be symbols of the Buddha-knowledge; in their inner nature they are mere symbols, only appearances, empty of final truth. But emptiness is itself the final truth; skilful means, the fact that only symbols are or can be used, is the highest truth of Buddhism. These few examples may indicate how the question of the validity of a religious symbol may be raised, and sometimes answered. It is an appropriate question for the philosopher of religion to raise. His interest is in the 1 Alston, op. cit, vol. I, p. 86. 2 Michael Pye, Skilful Means (London, Duckworth, I978), chapters I-3. 3 Lotus Suitra, chapter 2, from The Threefold Lotus Sutra, trans.

Of course, the use of such concepts as justification and validation within this paper has been relative; I have allowed that a symbolic use is validated if there are resources within the systematic thinking of the religion (or its potential for systematic articulation) from which a grounding relationship between symbol and Focus can be derived. In an absolute sense, the symbolic use would be justified only if the systematic claims of the religion were true. As I have said, shallow symbols do not need such grounding, but cannot have much power.</page></plain_text>
