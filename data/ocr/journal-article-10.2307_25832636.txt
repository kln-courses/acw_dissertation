<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medieval Literature 713 MEDIEVAL LITERATURE By David A. Wells, Professor of German atBirkbeck College, University 0fLondon 1. General Metzler Autoren Lexikon. Deutschsprachige Dichter und Schriftsteller vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart, ed. Bernd Lutz, 2nd rev. edn, Stuttgart, Metzler, vi + 905 pp., is one third larger than the already substantial hrst edition of 1986, the number of authors increased from 330 to 440. Not surprisingly, most of the additions are in the 20th c, and the result is arguably an unbalanced representation, at least as far as a canon is concerned. Another notable enhancement is the expansion of the modest bibliographical leads in the entries for many authors. Wolfgang Beutin et al., A History of German Literature. From the Beginnings to the Present Day, trans. Clare Krojzl, London, Routledge, 1993, x + 8oopp., is a translation of the third edition of Deutsche Literaturgeschichte of 1989 (see YWMLS, 51: 623), which can fairly claim to have achieved the status of a standard work since its hrst appearance in 1979. A brief concluding chapter takes account of German reunification (compare the German fourth edition, YWMLS, 54:648). The absence of the illustrations of the original is a small price to pay for a lucid English translation. The chief criticism to be levelled against this edition, presumably intended for those unable to read German adequately, is the arbitrary treatment of the literary quotations in German, which (as in the medieval literature chapter) are sometimes, but not always, accompanied by an English trans lation. Killy, Autoren, includes a large number of introductory articles of encyclopaedia type on both major and minor works and authors of the period, with detailed bibliographical leads. Authors include C. Cormeau, T. Cramer, B. Gajek, I. Glier, K. Grubmiiller, G. Hahn, C. Handl, E. Hellgardt, N. Henkel, U. Hennig, C. Huber, C. Kiening, G. Kornrumpf, N. H. Ott, F. Schanze, H.-H. Steinhoff, G. Vollmann Profe, P. Wapnewski, W. Williams-Krapp, and A. Wolf. Paul Raabe, Einfuhrung in die Bucherkunde zur deutschen Literaturwissenschaft, 11 th rev. edn (SM, 1), viii + 148 pp., is the hrst reissue of this invaluable short bibliographical guide for ten years. The work maintains its status, although some detailed judgements are becoming questionable, for example the claim that G. Ehrismann's work is the fundamental handbook for our period. Wulf Segebrecht, Was sollen Germanisten lescn? Ein Vorschlag, Berlin, Schmidt, 76 pp., largely consists of basic reading lists of major works of primary and secondary literature, the whole lightened by well-chosen, often witty, illustrations. The</page><page sequence="2">7i4 German Studies medieval period is dominated by the now quite numerous anthologies of texts of the period. The hrst sentence of a brief introduction answers the question of the title: everything. Fritz Peter Knapp, Die Literatur des Frith- und Hochmittelalters in den Bistumern Passau, Salzburg, Brixen und Trient von den Anfdngen bis zum Jahre 1273 (Geschichte der Literatur in Osterreich von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart, 1), ADEVA, 666 pp., marks an interesting reversal to literary history written by a single author (K. also writes the forthcoming second, late-medieval, volume of the seven-volume work). The underlying conception of a literature in Austria (or its constituent regions) accords both with the welcome inclusion of relevant Latin works and with the convenient, if in another sense arbitrary, division of the period 1156-1273 into Latin and German literature of the Passau diocese and the other three named dioceses respectively. The opening chapter on the OHG period is necessarily brief and focuses on the historical and geo graphical background to the relatively sparse manifestations of literature, while the period 1075-1156 comes into its own with detailed surveys of Early MHG religious poetry enriched by the context of the different genres of Latin theological writing. Notwith standing some necessarily arbitrary exclusions and inclusions and pressure of space, K. succeeds well in characterizing the works of the region in a vivid and readable style, showing an up-to-date knowledge of the problems of scholarship, choosing sensible examples to illustrate his commentary (e.g. the choice of Walther's songs discussed in detail), and not refraining from succinct value judgements when appropriate. The book undoubtedly meets its aim of being both a readable history and a work of reference, and will fill a niche for both non-specialist and professional scholar alike. Heinzle, Mittelalter, contains a collection of important essays which are united by the idea, explained by H. in his introduction (9-29), of the essential links between the Middle Ages and its problems with the present and, given this continuity, the denial to the period of any romanticizing 'special' or homogeneous status. P. von Moos (33-63) addresses the problems inherent in the concept of the Middle Ages as a unity with its over-simplified categories; H.-J. Gilomen (165-208) in a seminal essay argues that the notion of a popular culture differentiated from high culture cannot be sustained; G. Althoff (247-65) corrects prejudices about the attitude to law in the period; O. G. Oexle (297-323) in a treatment of the concept ofmemoria attacks the view that the individual in the period was insignificant; H. Wunder (324-54) points to the important role of women in the creation of pictorial memorial tapestries; U. Schaefer (357-75) notes the terminological problems apparent in discussion of the relevance of oral tradition, and sees literary formulae pointing back to a world of</page><page sequence="3">Medieval Literature 715 'shared social meaning'; K. Stackmann (398-427) makes a construc tive critique of B. Gerquiglini and the 'new philology'; and B. Brenk (431-50) and W. Kemp (451-76) show the interdependence of art and other forms of communication. D. H. Green, Medieval Listening and Reading. The Primary Reception of German Literature 800-1300, CUP, xv 4-483 pp., is a characteristically magisterial study drawing together the results of several years' research, some of it heralded in a series of articles on detailed problems to which must now be added a survey of the different degrees of literate status among the audience for court literature, Wisbey Vol., 7-26. The preliminary chapter on the relationship between orality and writing and the historical back ground of the Classical tradition and the Carolingian Renaissance reflects, as does the work as a whole, a mastery of the scholarly literature, showing in particular the limitations of the dogmatic application of the 'oral-formulaic theory' of improvised composition and the value of the work of Vollmann-Profe and Haubrichs. The heart of the book is its second part which identifies and discusses an astonishing range of evidence for three modes of reception, hearing, reading, and, the basis of G.'s highly convincing argument, the intermediate mode in which hearing and reading are not mutually exclusive. The conclusions emphasize how the symbiosis of oral and literate culture is reflected in different attitudes to history and to fiction, and point to the historical context of recital and reading. There is an appendix on MHG lesen. With its wealth of detailed documentation the study amounts to a work of reference as well as a meticulously argued thesis. A. Classen, Classen, Canon, 1-36, con siders the historical and contemporary relevance for medieval literature of discussion about the canon and canonicity. U. Liebertz Grun, Monatshefte, 86: 3-6, points to the pluralism of medieval thought, arguing that a term such as 'the Middle Ages' can be an impediment to the understanding of literature. Wilpert, Gespenster geschichte, includes, besides introductory chapters which identify the genre as prevalent in all literary epochs, a section on the Middle Ages (64-75). The author rightly draws attention to the work of C. Lecouteux and identifies a number of examples in the work of Caesarius of Heisterbach, Hartmann von Aue (Erec), postclassical romances, short verse narratives, and specialist literature on the black arts. H. Fuhrmann, Speculum, 69: 344-58, reviews evidence from the 11 th c. on for the medieval stereotype of the Germans as brutish and arrogant. Klaus von See, Barbar, Germane, Arier. Die Suche nach der Identitdt des Deutschen, Heidelberg, Winter, 417 pp., has a range of interesting material on the historical development of the national self-image of the Germans, much of it, naturally, with a 20th-c. flavour. Of especial interest are the chapter on the understanding of</page><page sequence="4">716 German Studies Tacitus and the cliche of the Germanic barbarian, the well-illustrated treatment of the reception of the Nibetungenlied, and the accounts of the popular ideology underlying the development of igth-c. philology and of Heusler's views. Thomas Mobius, Studien zum Rachegedanken in der deutschen Literatur des Mittelalters (EH, i, 1395), 1993, 311 pp. R. Bentzinger, JIG, 25.1, 1993: 8-22, reviews the fates and fortunes of medieval studies in East Germany. K. Akai, Akai, Altgermanistik, 2-12, describes the current state of medieval German studies in Japan. Wissenschaftsgeschichte der Germanistik im ig. Jahrhundert, ed. Jurgen Fohrmann and Wilhelm Vosskamp, Stuttgart, Metzler, viii + 792 pp., is an impressive collection of studies which illustrate how interest in the subject has developed in recent years and how central a role medieval studies play in it. The chapters of chief interest for our period are by U. Meves (the name Germanist, 25-47, a^so on tne establishment of Germanic philology as a discipline, 115-203), R. Kolk (the social and institutional background, 48-114), U. Hunger (the symbolic role of early German literature, 236-63), R. Krohn (the return to the sources and the primacy of the text, 264-333), and D. Kopp (Germanic philology and the educational system, 669-741). There is also much on the question of genres and the reception of Goethe and Schiller in particular. Matthias von Lexer. Beitrage zu seinem Lehen und Schaffen, ed. Horst Brunner (ZDL, Beihefte, 80), Stuttgart, Steiner, 1993, 248 pp., commemorates the centenary of L.'s death with a range of contributions on his achievement, most of them, naturally, concerned with lexicographical matters. R. Brunner (9-20) reviews L.'s activity in Wurzburg; R. Kolk (21-32) relates him to the Germanistik of his time; B. Naumann (33-81) publishes documents concerning his career); I. Reiffenstein (83-96) studies the Carinthian dictionary; N. R. Wolf (97-107) sees the problems of MHG dictionary compilation as a link with the present day; K. Gartner (109-31) studies L.'s working copy of the dictionary in the British Library; H. Hettrich (133-40) notes his approach to etymol ogy; G. Keil (141-57) discusses his treatment of specialized medical terms; M. Schlaefer (159-70) records his contributions to the Grimm dictionary; R. Sprandel (171-80) explains his editorial treatment of late-medieval chronicles; and A. Brandstetter (181-95) makes his treatment of the vocabulary of milling the basis of a wider characteri zation. Reproductions of two essays by L. conclude the stimulating collection. E. R. Haymes, pp. 23-38 of Re-Reading Wagner, ed. Reinhold Grimm and Jost Hermand (Monatshefte: Occasional Volume, 13), Madison, Wisconsin U. P., 1993, vii 4- 158 pp., writes on Wagner's relations with Altgermanisten, and V. Mertens, La Chanson des Nibelungen (see p. 739 below), pp. 113-28, is concerned with</page><page sequence="5">Medieval Literature 717 Wagner and Karl Simrock. F.-R. Hausmann, LJb, 35: 291-319, considers E. R. Curtius's achievement and publishes some letters. Werner Schroder, Kleinere Schriften. vi. Textuberlieferung und Textkritik, Stuttgart, Hirzel, 420 pp., is another useful reprint of S.'s work, with 31 items, the majority of them reviews and review articles, from the years 1965 to 1993. Layout and pagination of the original publi cations are retained. In an introduction S. unashamedly expounds his view that the purpose of textual criticism is to reach a version as close to the author's original as possible, and polemicizes against the current emphasis on a single manuscript within the context of the work's reception. He is no less dismissive of the relativization of value-judgements and the rejection of a canon of great works, asserting that there are indeed epigones! Gabriele Schieb, Ausgewahlte Schriften zur deutschen und niederldndischen Sprach- und Literaturgeschichte. Gcdenkschrift zu ihrem 75. Geburtstag, ed. Rudolf Bentzinger (GAG, 601), xv 4- 397 pp. Peter Wapnewski, Zuschreibungen. Gesammelte Sch riften, ed. Fritz Wagner and Wolfgang Maaz (Spolia Berolinensia. Berliner Beitrage zur Mediavistik, 4), Hildesheim ? Zurich, Weid mann, vii + 560 pp., contains reprints of 29 of W.'s publications which hrst appeared between i960 and 1992. The format consists of photographic reproduction of the original versions, including the page numbers. The book includes 11 substantial items central to MHG literature and as a whole is a remarkable tribute to the sheer range of W.'s work, and to his ability to relate later literature to seminal ideas deriving from the medieval period.

Six of the present essays deal with aspects of the libraries, church, art, and literature of St Gall, focusing on the 1600-1800 period but also constantly referring to the medieval background. Nine further contributions address the educational, pastoral, political, and scholarly activity of leading St Gall personali ties of the period in question.</page><page sequence="7">Medieval Literature 719 OTHER WORKS Paul Gerhard Schmidt, Probleme derSchreiber?Der Schreiber als Problem (Sitzungsberichte der Wiss. Gesellschaft an der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Univ. Frankfurt am Main, 31, no. 5), Stuttgart, Steiner, 18 pp., takes a broad look, with numerous examples, at medieval scribes, their professional background, status, and methods of work, different types of scribe and their division of labour, and above all the mistakes and eccentricities which characterize them. Die archivalischen Quellen. Eine Einfuhrung in ihre Benutzung, ed. Friedrich Beck and Eckart Henning (Veroffentlichungen des Brandenburgischen Lan deshauptarchivs, 29), Weimar, Bohlau, 298 pp., is a masterly survey of the nature and content of archival sources from the point of view of their user, chiefly but by no means exclusively the historian. The book is divided into two complementary sections of almost equal length. Part A deals with the sources themselves, chiefly written but with separate chapters on maps, plans, and the new electronic media. The review treats the subject both by historical period and according to the background, production, and dissemination of the different types of document. The significance of forged documents is notably not overlooked. Part B contains information for the user, with chapters supplying essential information on writing and materials; script, with a survey of palaeography and developments since the Middle Ages; seals and other credentials; coats of arms; forms of dating; names; and coins, weights, and measures. With full bibliography, numerous illustrations, and index, there is a wealth of material here for anyone exploring the fundamentals of the subject. Alexandru N. Cizek, Imitatio et tractatio. Die literarisch-rhetorischen Grundlagen der Nachahmung in Antike und Mittelalter (Rhetorik-Forschungen, 7), Tubingen, Niemeyer, x 4- 380 pp., is an important contribution to our under standing of the imitative process in medieval literature. C. identihes tractatio as the creative transformation or adaptation of a literary model, thus making the hndings of crucial importance for German literature even though the work is concerned wholly with the theoretical background. There is exhaustively detailed classification of the connotations and usages of the term, and its Classical and medieval application in different rhetorical contexts. The final chapter on didactic practice is especially enlightening: the examples of the treatment of the various aspects of the life of the hero, with Alexander the Great a prominent model, point directly to the inheritance of vernacular authors. Bernhard Pabst, Prosimetrum. Tradition und Wandel einer Literaturform zwischen Spdtantike und Spdtmittel alter (Ordo, 4), Cologne, Bohlau, 2 vols, x + 1-600, viii + 601 1184 pp., is a monumental dissertation which amounts to a complete</page><page sequence="8">720 German Studies history of the Latin works which mix prose and verse. The definition of the form is relatively broad and subjective, depending on the perceived authorial intention and a relatively frequent or regular use of verse passages. In spite of the vast body of texts included, coherence is given to the study by the fact that two thematic groupings emerge as predominant: philosophical and didactic works, and those of histori ography and hagiography. Both of these relate to specific lines of tradition which are conveyed with clarity. The late Classical roots of the former are apparent through school texts such as Martianus Capella and Boethius, the I2th-c. school of Chartres, and significant late-medieval writers such as Heinrich von Mugeln. The treatment of the second grouping, to which the second volume is largely devoted, includes material of fundamental importance for the rise of the genres in the vernacular. A final section addresses the formal aspects of the works. Claudia List and Wilhelm Blum, Buchkunst des Mittelalters. Ein illustriertes Handbuch, Stuttgart, Belser, 160 pp., is one of several works from this source (compare Lotte Kurras, Ritter and Turniere: see YWMLS, 54: 674) which at once provide a popular introduction to the subject and lay claim to scholarly standards. The authors successfully convey essential data relating to patronage and artists, materials and techniques, script and decoration, aspects of the chief historical periods, and the major genres of the medieval book. The only criticism to be levelled at this fine work is that the sumptuous beauty of the artwork might lead the uninformed reader to exaggerate the importance of illustrated manuscripts at the expense of more everyday productions. Bruno Laurioux, Tafelfreuden im Mittelalter. Kulturgeschichte des Essens und Trinkens in Bildern und Dokumenten, Stuttgart, Belser, 1992, 152 pp., is another work of similar format, this time a translation from the French. As the bibliography shows, the many aspects of the subject, notionally linked by the overarching but loose concept of an EjSkultur, relate well to recent scholarly interest: food among different social classes, the preparation of food and the crucial social and economic role of herbs and spices, regional usage, food production, kitchens and the sale and provision of food, table manners and customs, abstinence and over-indulgence. The lavish illustrations cover a wide range of subjects and are fully described and documented. Gabriele Bartz, Alfred Karnein, and Claudio Lange, Liebesfreuden im Mittelalter. Kulturgeschichte der Erotik und Sexualitat in Bildern und Dokumenten, Stuttgart, Belser, 128 pp., treats sexual love along the same lines. After an introduction focusing on the juxtaposi tion in the period of asceticism and sensuality, G. Bartz makes the works of Ovid the basis of a review of aspects of, and attitudes to, love and marriage in literature and life. A. Karnein provides a chapter on Andreas Capellanus, and C. Lange returns to the theme of the</page><page sequence="9">Medieval Literature 721 introduction with an essay on erotic carvings on wood and stone consoles, associating them with anti-Islamic propaganda. Paul Zumthor, Die Stimme und die Poesie in der mittelalterlichen Gesellschaft, trans. Klaus Thieme (FGADL, 18), 100 pp., translates La Poesie et la voix dans la civilisation medievale, now ten years old. The editors of the series explain their intention to open it to important foreign monographs in the light of the increasingly interdisciplinary approach to many fundamental problems in medieval studies. That the case is justified by the present work is undoubtedly true, for Z. has much to contribute to the methodological debate relevant to initia tives on the performance of medieval works such as those of U. Muller (see pp. 735, 738 below). Henning Graf Reventlow, Epochen der Bibelauslegung. n. Von der Spdtantike bis zum ausgehenden Mittelalter, Munich, Beck, 324 pp., attempts to cover a thousand years in this second volume of a history of Bible exegesis. Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine dominate the hrst chapter on the late Classical period. Afterwards the need for selectivity in a treatment partly aimed at a popular readership makes for a generally less satisfying impression than was the case with the hrst volume (YWMLS, 53: 618), so that, while Gregory the Great, Isidore of Seville, and Bede receive their due, the whole Carolingian period is represented by Alcuin and John Scotus Eriugena alone, for which the subsequent account of the basic formal methods of exegesis scarcely compensates. The high Middle Ages are the preserve of Abelard, Rupert of Deutz, Hugh of St Victor, Joachim of Fiore, Aquinas, and Bonaventura, so that even marginally less important figures pass unmentioned. The chapter on Rashi and Abraham ibn Esra is a welcome acknowledgement of the Jewish contribution, and Nicholas of Lyra and John Wyclif illustrate the late Middle Ages. The Early Medieval Bible. Its Production, Decoration and Use, ed. Richard Gameson, CUP, xiv + 242 pp., is a richly informative collection of essays on many aspects of the subject. P. McGurk (1-23) conveys the richness of the tradition of the oldest MSS of the Latin Bible, and R. Gameson (24-52) makes the BL Royal 1 .B.vii Gospel MS, which had Continental associations, the basis of a treatment of English book production in the 7th and 8th cs, while D. Ganz (53-62) studies the Carolingian Bibles from Tours, and R. McKitterick (63-77) con~ siders their cultural implications. M. Gibson (78-100) characterizes the Carolingian glossed Psalters, and R. Marsden (101-24) looks at the textual evidence for the Old Testament in late Anglo-Saxon England, while L. M. Ayres (125-54) and L. Light (155-76) treat Italian and French Bibles respectively, the latter complemented by E. A. Peterson (177-204) writing on visual errors in the iconography of French Gothic Psalters. E. Petersen (205-22) studies the Hamburg</page><page sequence="10">722 German Studies Bible of 1255 with particular emphasis on its illustrations and their arrangement. Finally, L. Smith (223-32) surveys in vivid outline the basic theology underlying the Bibles of the 12th and 13th cs. The contributions are distinctive in their ability to place narrow palaeo graphical study in the wider cultural context. The black-and-white illustrations are not particularly distinguished in quality but adequate to their practical function in the volume. F. Only, MJ, 27, 1992: 7-16, studies the theme of Deus incircumscriptus in Latin and vernacular texts. Id., DVLG, 67, 1993: 26-76, places the metaphor of literature as the essential bread of life at the heart of a study of the intention or effect of poetry, which ranges over the St. Trudperter Hohelied, Gottfried's Tristan, and many other works. Herbert Vor grimler, Geschichte der Hblle, 2nd rev. edn, Munich, Fink, 472 pp., is the work of a theologian rather than a medievalist, so that the closest V. approaches to a treatment of vernacular literature is in the surveys of the views of hell of the mystics. Nevertheless the period is, not surprisingly, central to the treatment, which ranges knowledgeably over the Classical and Jewish background, the Gospels, early apocalyptic and other apocryphal literature, the development of a theology of hell, Augustine, a whole host of diverse medieval writers, the Reformation, Enlightenment, and igth-c. philosophers, and various modern treatments of the subject, besides chapters on hell in art, contemporary literature, and popular culture. While not all these topics can be studied in the detail they deserve, there is admirably full documentation besides leads for further reading. M. Schumacher, MJ, 27, 1992: 65-76, documents the theme of the thousand wiles of the devil, mille nocendi artes, ultimately deriving from Virgil and occurring in many medieval Latin and German sources. Karin Lerchner, Lectulus Jkridus: Zur Bedeutung des Bettes in Literatur und Handschriftenillustration des Mittelalters (Pictura et poesis, 6), Bohlau, Cologne ? Weimar ? Vienna, 1993, xi + 575 pp. + 141 illus., traces the allegorical tradition of the bed in biblical usage and sets a wide range of examples from religious and secular courtly literature against this background. B.-U. Hergemoller, FHS, 21: 5-19, concerns sexual perversion in the theological metaphor of plague and leprosy. J. N. Neumann, Sudhoffs Archiv, 76, 1992: 214-31, studies attitudes to human malformation. Joyce E. Salisbury, The Beast Within. Animals in the Middle Ages, NY ? London, Routledge, x + 238 pp., adds to the considerable body of literature on this topic with many interesting examples. There are chapters on the definition of the animal, animals as property and food, their sexuality (with previously published material on bestiality), animals as human exemplars (bestiary, fables, beast epic, and statistics on the relative frequencies of different animals in various contexts), and humans as animals (hybrids,</page><page sequence="11">Medieval Literature 723 shape-shifting, monstrous beings). The thesis that binds this often disparate material is that before the 12th c. man and beast were conceived as distinctively separate, from the 12th c. on 'the lines between the species were not so clear'. This dubious argument reflects the fact that most of the evidence is from the later Middle Ages, for S. deals only tangentially with the development of the theme of the progeny of Cain, and with early Germanic conceptions of the relationship between man and beast, not at all. A. M. Kinghorn, Neophilologus, 78: 509-20, surveys the swan in literature and legend from Lohengrin on. In Colloque (Mont-Saint-Michel), J. Fuhrmann (37-44) documents negative representations of the dragon, and J. Leclercq-Marx (45-56) records its allegorical aspects, while G. Sodigne-Costes (65-75) reviews its treatment in encyclopaedic works, and Z. Sebkova-Thaller (77-90) studies some iconographical examples. W. Spiewok (91-102) interprets the beast as a chameleon. Dorothea Walz, Das Falkenbuch Friedrichs IL9 ADEVA, 31pp.+ 24 pis, broadly follows the format of C. A. Willemsen's abridged introduction, facsimile, and commentary of the De Arte Venandi cum Avibus (see YWMLS, 35: 519-20), but the text has a quite different orientation. W. characterizes the work on the basis of a narrative with numerous references to the plates, descriptions of eight MSS and prints of the work (also represented in the illustrations), and bibliography. In Heinzle, Mittelalter,]. Bumke (67~i02)makes Hugh of St Victor's De institutione novitiorum the basis of a rejection of the opposition between clerical and courtly cultures, since clerical, written culture enables the older physical culture of gesture to be transformed into the code expressed in courtly manners and cere mony; R. Schnell (103-33) applies a similar approach to the conception of courtly love; and U. Peters (134-62) shows the limited validity of G. Duby's theory of the noble family as the fundamental interest of literary works. InSchmidtke, Wunderbare, C. Meier (37-83) considers the poetic theory underlying the depiction of the marvellous in medieval literature, J. Schwann (85-110) points to the role of Boethius and Aquinas in establishing the transcendental concept of the supernatural, and C. Hunemorder (111-35) examines Albertus Magnus's critique of the fabulous element in medieval natural history, while U. Hennig (15-35) comments on the role of marvellous and miraculous deeds in heroic literature, and D. Schmidtke (209-18) examines the problem of understanding the medieval distinction between the real and the marvellous. J.-Y. Tilliette, Picone, Ovidius, 63-104, supplies fundamental information on the transmission of Ovid in the high Middle Ages, in a volume which also contains work on Ovid's poetics, his mythology, and his influence in antiquity. Edith Ennen, Frauen im Mittelalter, 5th rev. edn, Munich,</page><page sequence="12">724 German Studies Beck, 320 pp., is a welcome reissue and updating of this work which has rightly achieved distinction as one of the best treatments of a now highly popular subject. E. shows herself anxious to keep abreast of the latest scholarship and has worked into the text, notes, and biblio graphy additional material dealing with, for example, the mystics, the life of Jewish women, and witchcraft. W. Spiewok, Actes (Chantilly), 169-76, considers adultery in literature and in life. J. A. McNamara, Lees, Men, 3-29, postulates a 'Herrenfrage' in the period 1050-1150, during which the 'gender system' was 'restructured', and V. L. Bullough, ib., 31-45, uses literary texts to define medieval masculinity. Tomas Tomasek, Das deutsche Ratsel im Mittelalter (Hermaea, n. F., 69), Tubingen, Niemeyer, x + 372 pp., is a fascinating Kiel Habili tationsschrift which treats the subject of the riddle in its medieval German context exhaustively and succeeds above all by its admirable balance between theoretical underpinning in a linguistically based dehnition of the text-type and comment on the individual examples. T. has no difficulty in showing the romantic, folkloric understanding of riddles to be based on speculation, whereas the medieval examples are hrmly grounded in literary, indeed clerical tradition, as illustrated not least by collections such as the Joca Monachorum and Adrian and Epictitus, and the more highly developed tradition in Old English literature. For MHG literature works in the traditions of Apollonius of Tyre, Parzival, and later didactic lyric poetry, are shown to be be the three principal areas of interest. Historia Apollonii regis Tyri. Die Geschichte vom Kbnig Apollonius, trans, and introd. Franz Peter Waiblinger (dtv, 9324), DTV, 132 pp., is a reissue of the handy bilingual edition which first appeared in 1978 (see YWMLS, 40: 624). The bibliography has been expanded and updated. Otto of Freising and his Continuator, Rahewin, The Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa, trans., ann., and introd. Charles Christopher Mierow (Medieval Academy Reprints for Teaching, 31), Toronto U.P., ix 4- 367 pp., is a reprint of a translation of the Gesta Friderici I Imperatoris hrst published in 1953, following the standard edition. The text is lucid and easy to use beside the original with its inclusion of book and chapter references. C. Warren Hollister, Medieval Europe. A Short History, 7th edn, NY, McGraw-Hill, xviii + 414 pp., remains a useful introductory guide, with a wealth of basic information and bibliography, updated to take account of the latest research. Brian Tierney and Sidney Painter, Western Europe in the Middle Ages300-1475, 5th edn, NY, McGraw-Hill, 1992, xv+ 655 pp., treats the subject by way of a more extended narrative, incorporating material from earlier textbooks into a balanced account of philosophical and cultural as well as political and</page><page sequence="13">Medieval Literature 725 ecclesiastical history. Hans-Werner Goetz, Life in the Middle Ages from the Seventh to the Thirteenth Century, trans. Albert Wimmer, ed. Steven Rowan, Notre Dame U.P., ix 4-317 pp., is a welcome English translation of G.'s Leben im Mittelalter (see YWMLS, 48:672). The translation is generally fluent, apart from some awkwardness in the treatment of the literary excerpts. This is an admirable introduction to the period, combining a wealth of apposite examples with vivid presentation. Aaron J. Gurjewitsch, Das Individuum im europaischen Mittelalter, trans. Erhard Glier, Munich, Beck, 341 pp., is a produc tive if somewhat idiosyncratic treatment of the question of individual ity in the medieval period, in which literary figures are cited alongside autobiographical evidence. The fundamental thesis is that between Augustine and Abelard there is no evidence of a substantive concern with the personality of the individual, and only texts such as Berthold von Regensburg's sermons anticipate the hrst poets, Dante and Petrarch, who are 'modern' in the sense required by the presuppo sitions of the search. A chapter on the epic tradition focuses on Old Norse literary heroes, and one misses any reference to Wolfram and the established scholarly discussion about characterization and individuality in his works. Hartmut Boockmann, Fursten, Burger, Edelleute. Lebensbilder aus dem spaten Mittelalter, Munich, Beck, 239 pp., presents vivid pictures of some little-known lives from the later Middle Ages in nine chapters written in a lucid, almost popular style, but with details firmly anchored in sources documented at the end of the volume. The latter include records by and about the officers of the Order of Teutonic Knights, Frederick Ill's journey to Aachen for his coronation, Burkhard Zink, Sylvester Stodewescher, Wilwolt von Schaumberg, Albrecht Achilles of Brandenburg, Hermann Bote, Hans von Oldendorp, and the brothers Joachim and Heinrich von Pflummern. Orte des Alltags. Miniaturen aus der europaischen Mentaiitdts geschichte, ed. Heinz-Gerhard Haupt, Munich, Beck, 291 pp., is an interesting idea originating in a series of broadcasts: 28 short essays by a number of social historians, each devoted to a place or location and its cultural significance. With subjects such as the mill, mine, harbour, school, university, coffee house, town hall, court, prison, hospital, the content is necessarily very diverse, ranging from admirably balanced treatments which take full account of historical and geographical diversity to journalistic cliches unfounded in any substantial body of evidence, although brief bibliographies accom pany each topic. Literary sources, including those of our period, are acknowledged as of primary importance in the better contributions. Andreas Ranft, Adelsgesellschaften. Gruppenbildung und Genossenschaft im spdtmittelalterlichen Reich (Kieler historische Studien, 38), Sig maringen, Thorbecke, 364 pp., is a remarkable study of the social</page><page sequence="14">726 German Studies organization of the later medieval nobility which is likely to have repercussions in biographical work on aristocratic writers. Careful observation of the emblems and symbolic devices worn in various artistic portrayals and funerary monuments leads to the identification of about 70 orders whose membership cuts across the feudal hierarchy usually assumed to be dominant. The argument is all the more convincing since detailed studies of two orders (brooch and donkey) occupy over half the text. The cumulative effect of the tabulated names, places, and dates is to suggest that R. has successfully posited a quite new dimension to the background to the period. Herkunft und Ursprung. Historische und mythische Formen der Legitimation. Akten des Gerda Henkel Kolloquiums veranstaltet vom Forschungsinstitut fur Mittelalter und Renaissance der Heinrich-Heine-Universit'dt Dusseldorf 13. bis 75. Oktober 1991, ed. Peter Wunderli, Sigmaringen, Thorbecke, 239 pp., is a particularly wide-ranging collection of contributions on the question of my ths of origins, the subject given particular relief by the insight, developed in an introductory chapter by Wunderli (9-25), that the mythical basis of legitimation almost always takes precedence over the 'real' or 'historical' basis (although literary scholars might dispute such a distinction as anachronistic when applied to the Middle Ages in any case). A. Angenendt (27-52) reviews the origo gentis and genealogies going back to Adam; O. Langer (53-70) points to forms of legitimation in a range of Latin and German theological and mystic texts; K. Elm (71-90) explains its significance for the origin and establishment of religious orders; R. Hiestand (91-109) discusses the conception of civic legitimation in late-medieval cities; T. Nagel (111-18) considers an Islamic example; H. Fillitz (133-40) notes political representation in I2th-c. art; G. Dilcher (141-55) treats the legal and G. Keil (157-77) the medical aspects of the theme; and specific national dimensions are the subject of H. Hecker (Russia, 119-32), P. Wunderli (Romania, 179-205), W. G. Busse (England, 207-23), and B. Guthmiiller (the Italian Renaissance, 225-39). ^se Haari-Oberg, Die Wirkungsgeschichte der Trierer Grundungssage vom 10. bis 75. Jahrhundert (EH, 111, 607), 204 pp. Arnold Esch, Zeitalter und Menschenalter. Der Historiker und die Erfahrung vergangener Gegenwart, Munich, Beck, 245 pp., is a collection of essays which have much to say about the perception of the past in different periods, the chance element of historical transmission, and the manner in which medieval sources unwittingly reveal details about contemporary life. Two particularly astute studies address the question of how the writers of pilgrimage narratives interpreted foreign conditions, while others deal with the perception of social change in late-medieval Berne, the methodological implications of the approach, and several topics connected with the Italian Renaissance. Otto Mazal, Die Sternenwelt</page><page sequence="15">Medieval Literature 727 des Mittelalters, ADEVA, 1993, 168 pp., is an impressively detailed introduction to medieval astronomy and cosmology and the body of ideas related to them. The individual chapters dealing with the cosmos, the numinous function of the stars, the harmony of the planets, astrology, the prophetic influence of the stars, and the rhythm of life, are interspersed by 50 plates reproduced in the quality associated with this publisher, each accompanied by a detailed commentary relating it to the wider subject-matter. Politik und Heiligenverehrung im Hochmittelalter, ed. Jurgen Petersohn (Vortrage und Forschungen, 42), Sigmaringen, Thorbecke, 652 pp., is an impressive collection which by uniting the theological, historical, and legal aspects of the cult of the saints has much to tell us of fundamental attitudes in the period. A. Angenendt (11-52) is informative on the most basic attributes of sainthood, and H.-J. Becker (53-70) summarizes several facets of its legal associations, while B. Schimmelpfennig (73-100) reviews papal policy towards canoni zation, and J. Petersohn (101-46) considers the Imperial role in canonization and the translation of relics. Against this background there are detailed studies of the topic in all the major territories of Europe, Byzantium, and the Slavonic regions, besides chapters on Elisabeth of Thuringia and the cult of St Mark in Venice and Italian civic practice. The editor summarizes the far-reaching conclusions. Karl August Fink, Papsttum und Kirche im abendldndischen Mittelalter (dtv, 4619), DTV, 248 pp., is a paperback reprint of the vivid characterization of the medieval papacy which first appeared in 1981 (see YWMLS, 43: 735). The treatment of scholasticism and mysticism and some of their major exponents is a particularly welcome feature. Karl Suso Frank, Geschichte des christlichen Mbnchtums, 5th rev. edn, WBG, 1993, x+2iopp., includes revision and bibliographical updating of an introductory study last issued in 1983. F. takes a broad view of monastic history, tracing it from its origins in the early Christian ascetic tradition by way of early Eastern manifestations, the origins in the West and the role of St Benedict, the 11 th-c. and 12th-c. reforms, the mendicant orders, late Middle Ages, and subsequent developments. John W. Bernhardt, Itinerant Kingship and Royal Monasteries in Early Medieval Germany, c. 936-1075, CUP, 1993, xix + 376 pp., has much of interest on the practical problems of government in the period, focusing on the servitium regis and the relationship between the monarchs and their institutions. C. H. Lawrence, The Friars. The Impact of the Early Mendicant Movement on Western Society, London, Longman, x + 245 pp., is a highly lucid and readable history of the first century of the mendicant orders, from their beginnings to the Franciscan schism of 1322. An introductory chapter outlines the crisis of the I2th-c. Church by way of</page><page sequence="16">728 German Studies background, and besides the essential facts about the foundation and rise of the orders the narrative concentrates on the relationship of the friars to the towns, the universities, the secular clergy, and the ruling aristocracy, and the specific tasks undertaken on behalf of the papacy. Hermann Jakobs, Kirchenreform und Hochmittelalter 1046-1215 (Oldenbourg-GrundriB der Geschichte, 7), 3rd rev. edn, Munich, Oldenbourg, xii + 380 pp., remains an admirable handbook with its clear tripartite division into survey of the period, review of fundamen tal problems and directions of research, and bibliography, now of over 1,510 numbered entries. The family trees, time-chart, and detailed indexes make the work no less invaluable as the hrst point of reference for non-historians. Alain Demurger, Die Tempter. Aufstieg und Untergang 1120-1314, trans. Wolfgang Kaiser, 4th rev. edn, Munich, Beck, 345 pp., is a comprehensive history written in a vivid style with ample quotation from the original sources. All the essential historical facts are covered, including a particularly useful section on the inner organization of the order. Although D. makes full play of the survival of the templars in secret societies and the like, too little account is taken of their importance as a source for literary inspiration in their own time. P. Ganz, BGDSL, 116: 222-41, points, on the basis of an analysis of the language of contemporary documents, to the danger of reading a modern, rationalistic conception of 'policy' into the actions of a ruler such as Barbarossa. Jane Sayers, Innocent III: Leader of Europe 1198-1216, London, Longman, xiv + 222 pp., is a clear short biography which avoids preconceptions about the nature of the medieval papacy and seeks to identify the reasons for Innocent Ill's subsequent reputation. S. makes much of the political and social history of the period and includes chapters on the background to the papacy and Innocent's accession, power struggles involving the papacy, the Pope's relation to the law and the Fourth Lateran Council, movements within Christendom, especially the friars and the heretics, and the Crusades and Innocent's attitude to them. Walther von der Vogelweide is occasionally mentioned but not always believed, and there is full documentation of sources. Fer dinand Seibt, Karl IV. Ein Kaiser in Europa 1346 bis 1378 (dtv, 4641), DTV, 484 pp., is a paperback reproduction of the latest (fifth) edition of 1985 of the standard work on Charles IV. The work ranges far beyond political history in the narrow sense and convincingly shows the period as one of fundamental transition. Heinz Lowe, Religiositat und Bildung im fruhen Mittelalter. Ausgewahlte Aufsatze, ed. and introd. Tilman Struve, Weimar, Bohlau, XV+384PP., is an admirably conceived memorial volume of reprints of ten seminal essays from the years 1967-86, several originally in relatively inaccessible journals and conference proceedings. The subject-matter is dominated by the</page><page sequence="17">Medieval Literature 729 theme of the Christianization of early medieval Europe and related missionary activity. The pages are clear photographic reprints of the originals and the pagination of the sources is helpfully retained. Bibliography and index are added. 2. Germanic and Old High German K. Hauck, Fest. Beck, 197-302, delivers his 53rd monograph on the gold bracteates, and E. Seebold, ib., 601-18, studies their earliest illustration of Germanic motifs. Sylvia Althaus, Die gotlandischen Bildsteine: ein Programm (GAG, 588), 1993, 268 pp. V. Bierbrauer, FmSt, 28: 51-171, undertakes a major survey of Gothic archaeology and history. P. Scardigli, Fest. Beck, 527-38, classifies the Gothic MS transmission. Lotte Motz, The Beauty and the Hag. Female Figures of Germanic Faith and Myth (Philologica Germanica, 15), Vienna, Fassbaender, 1993, 144 pp., *s a comparative mythological study which might disconcert with its references to 'Germanic faith' and assumptions that the admittedly very late and disjointed Old Norse literary evidence, the primary sources for the study, can be aligned with West Germanic folkloric traditions, not to mention those of other Arctic peoples and the Ancient Near East, to construct arguments around a number of themes connected with the neglected female figures. The basic idea of the magic potency of the female who exposes herself, and the characteristics of the different types of female figure in the literary sources, are convincingly demonstrated, and the work is of interest for aspects of the background to heroic literature in particular. R. McTurk, SBVS, 24.1: 19-32, reconsiders the Scandi navian evidence of Germanic sacral kingship. James G. Russell, The Germanization of Early Medieval Christianity. A Sociohistorical Approach to Religious Transformation, OUP, xiii 4- 258 pp., advances the interesting thesis that the well-known accommodation of the early medieval Christian missionaries to Germanic ideas actually resulted in a wholesale 'Germanization' of Christianity. The first part of the work sets up a 'model of religious transformation' according to which religions are either 'world-rejecting' and concerned with universal salvation (early Christianity) or 'world-accepting and folk-centred' (the Germanic peoples). Although terms such as 'Indo-European religiosity' lack conviction, R. is fully aware of the dangers of over-generalization, and manages to find an array of support in authorities writing on religion in general and Germanic religion in particular. The second part is a useful review of the history of the conversion of the Germanic peoples in which account is taken of the literary evidence, citations from distinguished scholars again adduced in support, and the influence of the Ottoman emperors seen</page><page sequence="18">730 German Studies as the reason for the survival of the 'folk-religious reinterpretation of Christianity'. There is much food for thought in this book, the conclusions to which are clearly set out in a series of numbered statements, Ian Wood, The Merovingian Kingdoms 450-751, London, Longman, xii + 395 pp., is an admirably lucid account which makes more sense of the period than is usually the case and accordingly succeeds in establishing a coherent picture of the Merovingians and their achievement. Grounded in the standard sources which are listed together with nine pages of secondary works, the study ranges over the problems of interpretation and a full survey of political history besides chapters on the role of the Church, royal women, the neighbours of the early Franks, the monasteries, education, the economy, and missionary activity east of the Rhine, with an interesting re-evaluation of the achievement of St Boniface. There are helpful genealogies with the prosopography upon which they are based, and maps. Wolfgang H. Fritze, Untersuchungen zurfruhslawischen und fruhfrankischen Geschichte bis ins 7. Jahrhundert (EH, 111, 581), xxvi 4- 460 pp. Brigitte Englisch, Die Artes liberates im fruhen Mittelalter (5.-9. Jh.). Das Quadrivium und der Komputus als Indikatoren fur Kontinuitat und Erneuerung der exakten Wissenschaften zwischen Antike und Mittelalter (Sudhoffs Archiv, Beihefte, 33), Stuttgart, Steiner, 494 pp., is a major contribution to knowledge of early medieval science which wholly succeeds in its author's supplementary aim of demonstrating the independent achievement of the period in its own right. The survey of earlier research reveals that the situation is much more nuanced than an over-simplified contrast between the theories of 'continuity' and catastrophe-induced 'dark ages' might suggest. E. focuses on arith metic, geometry, and astronomy, three of the exact sciences from the quadrivium, using as a textual basis the relevant works of Macrobius, Martianus Capella, Cassiodorus, Isidore, Bede, and Hrabanus Maurus. To the analysis of the content and treatment of each discipline in these is added a section on the computus, as represented by Bede's De temporum ratione and Hrabanus Maurus's De computo. The authors' own intentions and emphases are seen as crucial in determining the attitude to Classical traditions. The possible conclu sions regarding the constitution and development of early medieval science are given exemplary clarity by their presentation in the form of six theses, all of which reject the conception of a break with the past in favour of a need to retain the inherited ideas. Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, ed. Rosamond McKitterick, CUP, xvii + 334 pp., is a splendid collection of essays on the period by a distinguished team of specialists, which will serve as both an introduction and a statement of current knowledge. G. Brown (1?51)</page><page sequence="19">Medieval Literature 73i surveys the chief attributes of the Carolingian Renaissance, its origins and continuity; J. L. Nelson (52-87) explains the theories of kingship and empire and their working-out in practice in the period and later; V. Law (88-110) outlines the study of grammar in its relation to the Classical and Christian background; M. Garrison (n 1-40) considers the chief aspects of the Latin literature of the period, and the vernacular tradition is surveyed by C. Edwards (141-70)^. Maren bon (171-92) focuses on the philosophical tradition, arguing convinc ingly, though on the basis of a relatively limited number of examples, for its greater originality than is usually assumed; M. Innes and R. McKitterick (193-220) outline the significance of historiography in the period, with interesting comments on the audience and underly ing patterns of thought; R. McKitterick (221-47) reviews current knowledge of palaeography and book production; G. Henderson (248-73) describes the major achievements of Carolingian art and explains its background influences; S. Rankin (274-316) writes on music and its relation to politics, language, and literacy; and, finally, R. McKitterick (317-23) briefly records the legacy of the Carolingians. All the contributions are written with exemplary clarity and are accompanied by admirable select bibliographies on each topic. Bernhard Bischoff, Manuscripts and Libraries in the Age of Charlemagne, trans. Michael Gorman (Cambridge Studies in Palaeo graphy and Codicology, 1), CUP, xvii + 193 pp., inaugurates an important new series with a fitting tribute to B., seven of whose essays, from the years 1963-81, are printed for the hrst time in English translation. The subject-matter is in every respect seminal: surveys of manuscripts in the early medieval period and in the age of Char lemagne itself; accounts of the court library under Charlemagne and under Louis the Pious, the latter with its important challenge to the received view of the later period as one of relative cultural decline; libraries and schools in the Carolingian Renaissance; palaeography and the transmission of Classical texts; and the role of Benedictine monasteries in the survival of Classical literature. The lucidity of the text ? well conveyed in the excellent translation ? masks the enormous wealth of supporting detail in narrative and footnotes alike. Hence the full indexes of cited manuscripts, names, and works are especially welcome as aids to the use of this impressively coherent body of scholarship. Schriftlichkeit im fruhen Mittelalter, ed. Ursula Schaefer (ScriptOralia, 53), Tubingen, Narr, 1993, vii + 292pp., includes work by H.-W. Goetz on Carolingian historiography (229-53) and by F. H. Bauml on oral and written traditions in the Heliand and in Otfrid (254-66). O. Berggotz, BW, 27: 1-48, docu ments the dissemination of the works of Hrabanus Maurus, while M. Perrin, Actes (Amiens), 111, 101-06, and B. Ribemont, ib., 115-26,</page><page sequence="20">732 German Studies write on attitudes to the exotic in Hrabanus Maurus and in other encyclopaedic works. Gerhard Kobler, Taschenwbrterbuch des althochdeutschen Sprachschatzes (UTB, 1823), Paderborn, Schoningh, li 4- 395 pp., is conceived as an abbreviated compact version of the new Wbrterbuch des althochdeutschen Sprachschatzes (see YWMLS, 55: 708-09). The dictionary is indeed handy to use, retaining basic meanings and grammatical informa tion, with indications of hypothetical forms and frequency counts. A short introductory grammar is a welcome bonus. Althochdeutsch. Syntax und Semantik. Akten des Lyonner Kolloquiums zur Syntax und Semantik des Althochdeutschen (1.-3. M'arz 1990), ed. Yvon Desportes (Serie german ique ancien, 1), Univ. Lyon III, Centre d'Etudes Linguistiques Jacques Goudet, 1992, 366 pp., includes work focused on specific texts by E. Meineke (the Pariser Gesprache, 323-57), E. Dittmer (Tatian, 245-58), Y. Desportes (Isidor, 293-321), T. Robin (the Heliand, 227-43), Otfrid (M. Krause, 47-68), Notker (S. Sondereg ger, 90-114, and H. Eilers, 115-51), besides more wide-ranging linguistic studies. Althochdeutsches Lesebuch. Zusammengestellt und mit Wbrterbuch versehen von Wilhelm Braune. Fortgefuhrt von Karl Helm, 17th edn, ed. Ernst A. Ebbinghaus, Tubingen, Niemeyer, viii 4- 259 pp., is largely unchanged since the previous edition of 1979, although there are notable improvements in the presentation of certain texts, e.g. the extract from the St. Pauler Glossen now reflects its interlinear format. The preface announces that in view of the appearance of Germanistik (!) the section of bibliographical references (never the most appealing feature of the book to students) will in future editions be pruned to the minimum details of manuscripts and major editions. While these evident doubts about the role and structure of the work were predictable at the time of the 16th edition (see YWMLS, 41: 680-81), it retains its pre-eminence among its rivals. H. Gotz, Sprachwissen schaft, 19: 123-64, considers various aspects of translation technique in a range of OHG texts and glosses. S. Strieker, ib., 183-230, approaches the problem of distinguishing the OHG from the MHG transmission in the glosses of MS Stuttgart, Wurttembergische Landesbibliothek HB xi 1. Dorothee Ertmer, Studien zur althochdeut schen und altsachsischen Juvencusglossierung (SA, 26), 407 pp., continues the impressive series of studies of early glosses from the school of R. Schutzeichel. The subject is the gospel harmony of c. 330 which became a standard school text. E. identifies ten MSS and 311 words within 277 glosses. Descriptions of each MS are followed by information essential to placing the material within an overall context of transmission. This results in much of historical interest in its own right, independent of the glosses themselves, which are finally subjected to minute linguistic analyses and to conclusions about their</page><page sequence="21">Medieval Literature 733 production and function. The same successful principles underlie Ulrike Thies, Die volkssprachige Glossierung der Vita Martini des Sulpicius Severus (SA, 27)5571 pp., which deals with the seminal hagiographical text together with the supplementary letters and dialogues on the same subject. In this case 13 MSS of the 8th-13th cs yield over 670 individual glosses, a substantial enhancement of the content of the older printed corpus. Apart from the immediate vernacular philologi cal interest of this study T.'s wider conclusions are of considerable importance, for the geographical range of these glosses, the evidence of a relatively free-standing tradition of glossing independent of other works, the relationship to Anglo-Saxon missionary activity, and the intensity of the tradition matched by glosses on no other saint's life, all confirm the crucial cultural importance of S.S.'s work both as Christian hagiography and as mediator of Classical rhetoric. Hartwig Mayer, Die althochdeutschen Griffelglossen der Handschrift Salzburg St. Peter a VII2 (SA, 28), 126 pp., though more modest in scale than the previous volumes, profits from the expertise of a master in the detection of scratch glosses. The relatively recent discovery identihes over 300 Latin and OHG glosses in a text of Jerome's Matthew commentary. Of these, 209 proved legible and are edited with the information and analysis usual in the series. The inclusion of the relevant Latin text is a particularly valuable aid to understanding the context of the glosses, although the overall conclusions are necessarily limited. Birgit Meineke, Liber Glossarum und Summarium Heinrici. Zu einem Munchner Neufund (AAWG, 207), 198 pp., is evidence of the continuing importance of research on the Summarium Heinrici for OHG vocabulary. The newly discovered fragment in question is Munich Clm 29 670/9 and relates to a known fragment of the long version of S.H. Book XL The study follows the models of others from the school of R. Schutzeichel and incorporates in meticulous detail a codicologi cal description, dating and linguistic analysis, edition of the glosses in relation to the Nuremberg fragment, and analysis of the sources of both documents. The conclusions emphasize that the particular importance of the fragments lies in their age and their connection with other glossaries. W. Haug, Fest. Beck, 303-26, asks fundamental questions about the genre of heroic poetry, interpreting the Franks Casket as a Christian rejection of its inherent cruelty. Id., Heinzle, Mittelalter, 376-97, analyses the particular characteristics of heroic epic in the transition from oral to written tradition. J. Krauel, Classen, Canon, 37-52, analyses the sentence structure of the Hildebrandslied, and G. A. Henrotte, ib., 53-64, draws attention to the sounds apparent in its alliterating patterns. U. Schwab, Fest. Beck, 554-83, studies charms with incantations reflecting aspects of the life of Christ. Der Lorscher</page><page sequence="22">734 German Studies Bienensegen. Ein althochdeutscher Spruch, ed. Karlheinz Platte, Lorsch, Laurissa, 1993, 15 pp. Die lateinisch-althochdeutsche Tatianbilingue Stiftsbibliothek St. Gallen Cod. 56, ed. Achim Masser and Elisabeth De Felip-Jaud (SA, 25), 695 pp., supplies an immensely useful service with an edition of the Tatian which for most practical purposes of reference replaces that of Sievers. In an informative introduction M. goes over the early editorial history, pointing out that Sievers paid scant attention to the Latin text already disregarded in J. A. Schmeller's earlier edition, leading to the establishment of false 'variants' from the Fulda text. Besides a full codicological description of the St Gall MS M. provides a near-diplomatic transcription of the Latin and German in parallel columns on the right-hand pages, which correspond to the foliation of the original. The deviations which make the text more readable are systematic and explained in detail. Emphasizing that the scribes wrote each line of both Latin and German in order full across the page, M. provides on the left-hand pages an apparatus including, besides text-critical data, details of the MS folio, scribe, chapter numbering, reference to Sievers's numbering, biblical sources, and MS sections. This volume will receive the use it deserves. A. Masser, Sprachwissenschaft, 19: 115-22, argues that exegetical tradition has influenced the Tatian translator's version of Matthew 25. 32-33. Joh. Phil. Palthen, Tatiani Alexandrini Harmoniae Evangelicae antiquissima Versio Theotisca, ed. Peter Ganz (ESGP, 2), 1993, xviii + xiv + 434 pp., is an interesting contribution both to Tatian studies and to the history and understanding of the methods of early modern scholarship. The body of the work is a facsimile reproduction, adequately legible for all practical purposes, of Johann Philipp Palthen's edition (Greifswald 1706) of the Latin and OHG text together with other OHG works. Building on the insight that E. Sievers was wrong to conclude that Franciscus Junius brought a modern copy of the St Gall codex to Oxford, G.'s brief but immensely informative introduction shows how, in spite of some obvious inadequacies, P.'s work gives access to the evidence of MS Junius 13 which future Tatian editors will have to take into account.

Das ausgehende Mittelalter, Humanismus und Renaissance 1370 1520 (Geschichte der deutschen Literatur von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart, 4), 2nd edn, rev. Hedwig Heger, Munich, Beck, xii + 927 pp., is substantially revised and expanded almost 25 years after the first edition (see YWMLS, 32: 510-11). In her new preface H. is unduly modest about her Herculean task of revision, which has successfully incorporated many new formulations while maintaining the pagination of the first edition. Hence the increased length of the book comprising almost 100 additional pages is almost entirely attributable to the total recasting of the bibliography, which now provides an astonishingly compact yet comprehensive survey of the scholarly literature, incorporating the explosion of scholarship in the past three decades and thus making the new edition an essential acquisition. As an added bonus the very full index now includes references to the bibliography and remedies a substantial defect of the hrst edition by indicating the main reference to an author or work in italic type. JOWG, 7, 1992-93, is largely concerned with literature and the town, and includes K. Alfen (11-23) on MHG literature on the Trojan theme intended for a civic audience, M. Dallapiazza (103-14) on the reception of Boccaccio, and L. E. Saurma-Jeltsch (305-42) on the development of the illustrated MS in the civic milieu. Acta (Passau) commences with a series of studies on Wolfger von Erla by historians. E. Boshof (11-42) examines the relationship between central and territorial authority in the Passau area c. 1200; F.-R. Erkens (43-67) focuses on Wolfger's own policy as Bishop of Passau; W. Stormer (69-106) looks at the Bavarian and Austrian nobility of the period; T. Frenz (107-37) studies Wolfger's chancery and its documents, R. Hartel (139-94) his administrative documentation as Patriarch of Aquileia, and W. Stelzer (195-212) the evidence for the study of law and jurisprudence in Passau. This provides a fitting context for the literary essays which include work by U. Meves (215-47) on courtly society in Passau, and F. P.

Das ritterliche Menschenbild in der Dichtung des europdi schen Mittelalters und der islamischen Welt, ed. Stefano Bianca, ADEVA, 279 pp., is an unusual study of chivalry by modern standards. The value of the work lies less in the intensely personal vision of the nobility of the knightly ethos and the idealization of minne between the sexes underlying it, which have a distinctly romanticizing flavour against the background of much recent research, than in the emphasis on the reciprocal interchange of chivalric values between East and West. F. supplies Arabic examples of the literary reflection of the ethical associations of the rider-knight, places the work of Fidausi beside the Chanson de Roland and a comparable story from the Arabian Nights beside Wolfram's Willehalm, and makes the parallels more convincing by highlighting historical examples of the meeting of Christian knightly aristocrats with their Saracen counterparts. The second part of the book illustrates the living reality of chivalry by interpreting works of Chretien de Troyes and the German Minnesang as the literary expression of the values embodied by Eleanor of Aquitaine, Marie de France, and William the Marshal.

Frakes,</page><page sequence="27">Medieval Literature 739 Brides and Doom. Gender, Property, and Power in Medieval German Women's Epic, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania U.P., vii + 29opp., is a Marxist feminist reading of the Nibelungenlied, Klage, and Kudrun, which will allay the fears of any concerned that modern critical approaches have not since the Nl. commentary of Mowatt and Sacker been adequately tested on these monuments, regarded, along with the whole of Classical Greek and Roman literature, as 'elitist and misogynistic as well as more subtly racist'. In focusing on issues of sexual politics in the works F. brings the whole jargon of his school to bear, obsessed as it is with both sex and politics. The most entertaining parts of the book are not so much the long-winded analyses of the sexual harassment of Kudrun or the rape of both Kriemhilt and Briinhilt ('metaphor' is invoked to take account of text which does not immediately justify such readings), as the numerous side-swipes at traditional scholarship and especially at those such as G. Schweikle, an 'insider with outsider's ideas', who dared to note the importance of relations between the sexes in the NL but disregarded the baggage of feminism. Readers of YWMLS are warned that this reviewer's scepticism is necessarily conditioned by his scholarly positivism or, worse, by his alignment with the patriarchal philologists, well educated, white, middle-class, ostensibly heterosexual and pre dominantly Christian males, who conspire not to take F. and his kind too seriously.

Hermann Reichert, Heldensage und Rekonstruktion. Untersuchungen zur Thidrekssaga (Philologica Germanica, 14), Vienna, Fassbaender, 1992, x + 67 pp., is a monograph consciously taking a neo-Heuslerian stance in its attempt to reconstruct hypothetical sources. R. is obviously aware of the potential criticism of dealing too much with alleged sources and too little with extant literature, but gives the approach a modern validity by posing the question as to whether a redactor or performer connected an array of heterogeneous stories connected with Dietrich and linking this with the problem of oral tradition. The essentially positive answer to the quest is reached through a clear and concise line of argument, the judgements on detailed textual points being systematically reserved for appendices. E. R. Haymes, Fest. Kreuzer, 63-70, notes reflections of German oral tradition in the Thidrekssaga, and T. M. Andersson, Fest. Beck, 1-23, relates the genesis of the Thidrekssaga to the German literary analogues, while T.

G. places Hartmann's Arthurian romances, Wolfram's Parzival, and Gottfried's Tristan at the centre of the discussion, with frequent reference to Chretien. With individual chapters focusing admirably on the essential details of the problems of oral and written tradition, Latin theory of literature and the relevance of Alan of Lille and integumentum in particular, the concept of historia, and the poets' own views of the nature and function of their narrative, G. covers much ground in little space and convinces precisely because of the relative perspective in which all these issues are viewed. Her conclusion, that 'hctionality' is a valid concept to apply to the classical courtly romance and that the tradition of Latin poetics is an essential component in its achievement, is unspectacular, but for that very reason carries conviction. Chloe, 20, is entitled Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Lbwen, ed. Xenja von Ertzdorff and Rudolf Schulz, Amsterdam, Rodopi, vi 4- 636 pp., and besides German translations of the Czech Bruncvik (W.

Baumann (197-217) the Russian version of the legend of Henry the Lion. R. Luhr (219-43) studies the origin of Leonois and the grateful lion in the Mabinogion and in Chretien de Troyes, D. Rieger (245-85) makes a survey of some of the copious literature seeking to interpret the lion of Yvain, but ignores Hart mann's version, X. von Ertzdorff (287-311) writing somewhat inconclusively on the latter, the alchemical implications of which are detected by H. Gebelein (313-30). R. Voss (331-52) discusses Ulrich Fiietrer's Iban, B. Besamusca (353-68) the reception of Yvain in the Low Countries, H.

Werner (563-92) surveys the iconography of St Jerome. The chief achieve ment of the volume is the drawing together of all this material within a comparative framework, but it must be added that many of the contributions have little new to say on well-known themes, or else are frankly far-fetched. W. H. Jackson, Wisbey Vol., 39-54, analyses the evidence for the buhurt.]. W. Thomas, GN, 25.1: 3-5, notes that the well-known departure and return motif is in German Arthurian romance associated as often with a second, more realistic kingdom, as it is with Arthur's court. W. Hasty, Monatshefte, 86: 7-21, argues that the associations of knightly gewalt and ere in Hartmann and Wolfram do not point to an ethical or moral basis for chivalry. D. A. Wells, FmSt, 28: 296-332, shows how the didactic Disticha Catonis was accommodated to courtly values, and suggests that it formed the model for the moralizing precepts in Hartmann's Gregorius, 243-65, Gottfried's Tristan, 5019-52, and Wolfram's Parzival, 170,15 ? 171,24.

Deist, GQ, 67: 463-69, compares the kiss of Ascanius in Veldeke and in his two predecessors. H. Beckers, Fest. Lemmer, 17-37, studies the problem of guilt in Graf Rudolf and E. Hesse, JRG, 3: 95-113, considers magic and magicians in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's Lanzelet. HARTMANN VON AUE W. H. Jackson, Chivalry in Twelfth-Century Germany. The Works of Hartmann von Aue (Arthurian Studies, 34), Cambridge, Brewer, xiv + 320 pp., is a richly informative study which consistently shows the benefits to be derived from a treatment of the subject in relation to H.'s works in their entirety, from a thorough knowledge of the most recent scholarship on H. and on the historical, legal, and cultural background, from detailed comparisons of H.'s texts with their known sources, and from a superbly integrated assessment of the linguistic, literary, and external evidence. J. treats the works neither as sociological documents nor as artificial stylizations of reality but rather treads a sensibly balanced path between the two extremes. The view of H.'s 'literary self-interpretation of knighthood' which emerges is convincing through its meticulous demonstration of an author at pains to criticize, but not reject, his profession in a period of transition, and at the same time shows how many of the detailed topics upon which older scholarship focused can be resolved when placed in a wider perspective. D. Duckworth, Mediaevistik, 5, 1992 [1994]: 57-70, studies Hartmann's personal statements about the knowledge of God, and D. N. Yeandle, Wisbey Vol., 193-228, analyses schame in Hartmann. K. Akai, Akai, Altgermanistik, 13-31, explains Japanese students' predilection for Hartmann on the grounds of his formal perfection. In Buschinger, Erec, aspects of Hartmann's version are studied by D. Buschinger (H. as adaptor, 11-23); A. Classen (speech and silence, 25-42); V. Mertens (feminine identity, 61-74); J.-M. Pastre (Erec's verligen, 89-100); R. Perennec (social aspects of H.'s changes to Chretien, 101-15); D. Rocher (the theme of Erec and two others, 117-26); and W. Spiewok (H.'s compositional technique, 127-34). G. See, Rarergon, 12.1: 27-38, identifies some structural parallels in the bipartite pattern of Erec, and P. W. Hurst, MAe, 63: 211-21, studies the intellectual background to Enite's control of the horses, Erec, 3440-71, while M. H.

Liebertz-Griin, Chloe, 19: 297-328, interprets the Erec and Iwein romances of Hartmann and Chretien as models of a process of socialization, and H. Wandhoff, ZDP, 113: 1-22, emphasizes the importance in Erec and Iwein of the communica tion of chivalric deeds by ears and eyes to the public arena of the court. J. Rider, Romania, 112: 100-28, shows how Hartmann in his Arthurian romances transforms the fantastic elements of Chretien, and D. Peil, Actes (Chantilly), 119-39, surveys the use of clothing in Hartmann's Arthurian romances. L. Okken, ABAG, 40: 107-09, considers the corrupt line Gregorius 108 and postulates ungeschoz, 'without a loincloth'. B. Plate, MJ, 28, 1993: 67-90, shows how Arnold von Lubeck substitutes an ecclesiological for H.'s courtly ethic. M. Wynn, Wisbey Vol., 245-59, places the submissive silence of the girl at the end of Der arme Heinrich against a fascinating background of evidence on female spirituality and marriage, and F. Wagner, ib., 261?74, notes examples of the modern reception of the work. K. Shea, Exemplaria, 6: 385-403, makes a feminist reading of Der arme Heinrich, finding a violent erotic voyeurism at its heart. Barbara Schmidt-Krayer, Kontinuum der Reflexion.

Wolfram von Eschenbach, Parzival. Nach der Ausgabe Karl Lachmanns, rev. and comm. Eberhard Nellmann, trans. Dieter Kiihn (Bibliothek des Mittelalters, 8/1, 8/2), 2 vols, DKV, 964, 868 pp., includes in vol. 1 the text of Books 1-11 with translation on facing pages, and in vol. 11 the remainder of the text and translation and supplementary material occupying pages 411-868. The text follows Lachmann with minor deviations listed separately, chiefly preference for the punctuation of other editors. K. provides a few pages of introduction to his translation which, however spirited, leaves some reservations, particularly in his treatment of names and</page><page sequence="34">746 German Studies in the printing on a line-by-line basis opposite the original, which can be deceptive for the reader who has limited familiarity with MHG. N.'s commentary concentrates on detail relating to the social background, literary tradition, the relation to the source, cross referencing within the work, and vocabulary of interest. By setting these specific targets and eschewing the quagmire of interpretation N. produces an admirably balanced commentary which can be con sulted with profit and goes far to represent an updating of the work of E. Martin, to which, however, reference is made as to a limited body of other literature listed in a bibliography of less than 30 pages. Other useful supporting material includes family trees, an index of proper names, and an index to the commentary itself. Jean-Marc Pastre, Structures litter aires et tripartition fonctionnelle dans le 'ParzivaV de Wolfram von Eschenbach. La quite du gral, Paris, Klincksieck, 1993, 446 pp., applies G. Dumezil's theory of the three medieval classes to P. Id, JRG, 3: 153-63, differentiates between 'high' and 'low' magic in the work; see also Classen, Canon, 65-81, and Buschinger, Kbnig Artus, 167-79. Fourquet Vol. includes work on P. by K.

Haferland, ZDP, 113: 23-51, argues that Robert de Boron is W.'s source for the esoteric mysteries of the grail; Id., Euphorion, 88: 263-301, shows the significance of Pentecost in P., with reference to the use of feast days as narrative signals in the Queste del Saint Graal and other works, and D. N. Yeandle, ib., 302-38, analyses the concept of schame in the work in great detail. D. Buschinger, Actes (Amiens), 11, 49-54, J.-M. Pastre, ib., 109-17, and W.

Keil, 129-48, clarifies the background to Wolfram's list of snakes (P., 481, 6-18); Id., Trivium, 28, 1993: 23-37, investigates the dragon themes in P, 483. C. J. Steppich, ZD A, 122, 1993: 388-417, interprets the redespaher man oiP. 229, 1-22, as an agent provocateur of the grail company intended to test strangers at the castle, and R. Krohn, Cramer, Gegenspieler, 88-113, studies the opposition of Gawan and Clinschor, the latter being the subject of S. Tuchel, ASNS, 231: 241-57. J.

Alexander Schwarz (Tausch, 2), Berne, Lang, 1990, 181 pp., considers the female reader of P. Aspects ofParzival reception are discussed in the Fourquet Vol. by M.-R. Diot-Duriatti (the 18th c, 89-97), s- Kusicke (E. T. A. Hoffmann, 131-47), and A.-J. Baudrier (some 20th-c. reworkings, i-9). Wolfram von Eschenbach, Willehalm. Nach der Handschrift #57 der Stiftsbibliothek St. Gallen, ed. Joachim Heinzle (ATB, 108), xxxii + 474 pp., replaces the edition of A. Leitzmann and presents in ATB format the new edition hrst published in the DKV series (see YWMLS, 53: 644-45), tne text following a normalized reading of MS G. Those concerned with the history and justihcation of H.'s edition will need the DKV edition, for the introductory material is here reduced to the minimum appropriate for the ATB series. The index of proper names is a useful accompaniment to the critical text. H. Beckers and N. H. Ott, Wolfram-Studien XIII (see p. 769 below), pp. 262-90, report the discovery of a new illustrated Willehalm fragment. J. Greenfield, Trivium, 28, 1993: 38-51, studies the conception of love in Whm, and K. Kirchert, ASNS, 231: 258-70, examines the discrepancy in the work between the crusading ethic and mercy towards the heathen. W. Schroder, Fest. Lemmer, 105-15, suggests that the five named horses in Whm are merely horses, insinuating that F. Ohly exaggerates their spiritual and symbolic role in Parzival. GOTTFRIED VON STRASSBURG Werner Schroder, Kleinere Schriften. v. Ifber Gottfried von Strafiburg, Stuttgart, Hirzel, 245 pp., advances this useful series of reprints with</page><page sequence="36">748 German Studies a collection containing 12 items first published between 1973 and 1993. A substantial proportion of the contents consists of reviews and review articles, and for the interpretation of Tristan in particular S.'s characteristically polemical style does not always clarify the notor ious difficulties of the work. The original pagination is helpfully preserved in the photographically reproduced texts. A. Stevens, Wisbey Vol., 319-35, writes on the rhetorical background to the poetics of invention in T, emphasizing its memorial quality, and P. W. Hurst, ib., 337-46, illustrates the Neoplatonic background to the theme of circularity in the love grotto. J. H. Thompson, Tristania, 15: 1-11, includes Gottfried in a comparative study of Tristan's identity, and D. Rocher, Fourquet Vol., 203-06, comments on G.'s conception of love and suffering, while J. Janota, pp. 55-68 of Grofie Werke der Literatur. Eine Ringvorlesung an der Universitdt Augsburg, ed. Hans Vilmar Geppert, 1, Tubingen, Francke, 1990, 246 pp., considers the basic morality of T, and J. W. Baldwin, JMRS, 24: 327-53, mentions G. in a study of the trial by ordeal. I. Karg, ZDP, 113: 66-87, interprets the role of Marke in terms of the historical background of a number of romance motifs. D. Buschinger, Colloque (St.-Valery-sur-Somme), 25-36, studies Marke as cuckold, and W. Riemer and E. Egert, Seminar, 30: 95-106, comment on the artistic realm in T, seeing list as closely associated with it. W. C. McDonald, Tristania, 14, 1993: 59-96, interprets newness and renewal in T, while J. E. Jost, ib., 15: 57-74, studies decepdon, and J.-M. Pastre, ib., 123-34, G.'s concep tion of love. E. Willms, ZD A, 123: 19-44, rejects the view that the bread of Gottfried's prologue has eucharistic associations, seeing it rather as the fundamental metaphor for the nourishment of the 'living', the poet's immediate audience, in general. B. Krause, Fest. Jons, 18-40, studies bast in T. A. C. Spearing, The Medieval Poet as Voyeur: Looking and Listening in Medieval Love-Narratives, CUP, 1993, x + 321 pp., includes sections on the theme of secret watching and listening in T, especially at court and in the love-grotto episode. T. Tomasek, ASNS, 230, 1993: 371-78, interprets Gottfried's Setmunt (12,216), on the basis of the MS variants, as seite min munt. R. Weick, Fest. Bauer, 113-36, places the sparrow-hawk in T. in its ornithological context, and J.-M. Pastre, Colloque (Mont-Saint-Michel), 57-64, includes T. in a study of dragons. P. M. Thomas, Neohelicon, 21.1: 217-46, finds Indian parallels to Gottfried and other authors. OTHER ROMANCES E. Willms et at., GRM, n. F., 44: 129-53, reject the didactic understanding of Moriz von Craun in favour of an interpretation of the work as a political satire on Maurisse II of Craon (d. 1196). K.

Klare, LB, 83: 485-521, interpret the Hojir episode, and consider the implications of the introduction of the historical Hoyer von Mansfeld into the work. E. Schmid, GRM, n. F., 44: 266-87, considers Heinrich von dem Turlin's Crone in terms of his reception of Parzival, and S. Maksymiuk, GQ, 67: 470-83, hnds a medieval reality behind the magician Gansguoter. H. J. R. Birkhan, Wisbey Vol., 363-89, distinguishes three narrative layers in Strieker's Daniel, the heroic, the Arthurian, and the contemporary, and S. L. Wailes, ColGer, 26, 1993: 299-315, claims that in his Daniel Strieker exploits Parzival but rejects its values, while G.

The inclusion</page><page sequence="38">75? German Studies of Wolf's numbering of each strophe and tabulated comparisons reveal that the most significant differences lie in the order of the strophes rather than in the text itself. S.'s introductory material deals with language, script, and versification, and each volume concludes with some provisional detailed observations on the new text and its significance. With more than three fifths already available, the work will clearly lead to renewed debate about the genesis of the J. T.

The study is argued with S.'s characteristic incisiveness and is as important for the problem of the authorial roles adopted in the work as for the textual criticism itself. The conclusion favours the rejection of the Hinweis-Strophen from the prospective new edition. C. Bertelsmeier-Kierst and J.

McDonald, The Tristan Story in German Literature of the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance. Tradition and Innovation, Lewis ton ? Queens ton ? Lampeter, Edwin Mellen, 1990, viii + 227 pp., is an unusual and useful study which takes a wholly literary approach to the later works on Tristan, explicitly refusing to see them only in relation to the 'two icons', Eilhart and Gottfried. There are substantial interpretative chapters on the works of Ulrich von Turheim, Heinrich von Freiberg, Tristan als Mbnch, the prose Tristrant, and Hans Sachs. While McD. succeeds in giving due credit for qualities not normally associated with these texts, he does not disguise the increasing tendency to treat the subject-matter in didactic and moralizing terms. D. Buschinger, Tristania, 14, 1993: 1-8, writes on Heinrich von Freiberg's Tristan. S. Jefferis, Classen, Canon, 135-52, makes a comparative source-study of the versions of the Aristotle and Phyllis episode, focusing on Ulrich von Etzenbach's Alexandreis. In Buschinger, Kbnig Artus, M. Meyer (147-58) reviews the fate of Arthur in the i3th-c. romances, D. Buschinger (65-88) reviews the late-medieval Arthurian romance in Germany, and also (89-106) the German tradition of the grail, G.

T. chooses MS A as Leithandschrift and supplies significant variants from the other two MSS in the critical apparatus. The introduction, besides detailing the scribal peculiarities, places the work in its literary context and supplies a detailed summary of the content. The text is clearly laid out and an index of proper names is appended. G. Borgnet, Fourquet Vol., 39-58, studies Ulrich Fuetrer's grail romance. Tristrant und Isolde. Prosaroman.

LYRIC POETRY Gunther Schweikle, Minnesang in neuer Sicht, Stuttgart, Metzler, x + 459 pp., contains reprints of 16 essays hrst published between 1963 and 1991. The emphasis falls on the poets Morungen, Walther, and Neidhart, but more significant is S.'s general approach which reflects the transformation of the understanding of the textual basis of the lyric and the acceptance within the past generation of variants as equipollent manifestations of the reality of Minnesang in transmis sion and performance. C. Cormeau, pp. 25-42 of Die Genese literarischer Texte. Modelle und Analysen, ed. Axel Gellhaus and Winfried Eckel, Wurzburg, Konigshausen &amp; Neumann, 361 pp., considers the role of the courtly lyric text between genesis, use, and transmission. T. Bein, JIG, 25.2, 1993: 30-49, comments on the fundamental typology of the high medieval lyric. J.-D. Muller, IASL, 19.1: 1-21, suggests that Minnesang had a practical function as an effective form of courtship, and hence develops its own unique concept of hction. A. M.

Spruchlyrik. Mittelhochdeutsch I Neuhochdeutsch, ed., trans., and comm. Giinther Schweikle (UB, 819), 526 pp., is the first major recent new edition which decisively breaks with the tradition of Lachmann and, based on the modern conception of a fluid text, aims at a version rooted in the evidence of a single medieval MS ? in this case in practice usually MS C. The substantial introduction ranges over life, work, style, transmission, metre, and melody, with an especially interesting chapter on the treatment of the different strophes in a single melody: since S. is fundamentally sceptical about older notions of the unity of strophic groups, his largely pragmatic solution to the problem, where the preponderance of the MS evidence provides no obvious answer, is to place strophes with the chief name of theme of the group at the beginning, followed by strophes relating to other patrons, and finally the purely didactic strophes. This edition is a monumental achieve ment and a milestone for the Reclam series. O. Ehrismann, pp. 9-28 of Das Erotische in der Literatur, ed. Thomas Schneider (GANDLL, 13), 1993, 206 pp., writes on the erotic element in Walther. L. P.Johnson, Acta (Passau), 281-99, re-examines the evidence for Walther's relationship to Wolfger von Erla, and in particular the meaning of der biderbe patriarkc, and M. G. Scholz, ib., 301-23, relates the problem to that of Walther's status as a 'professional' poet. Martin Wenske, cSchwellentexte3 im Minnesang Walthers von der Vogelweide: exemplarische</page><page sequence="41">Medieval Literature 753 Interpretationen ausgewahlter Lieder (EH, i, 1477), 116 pp. C. Handl, SM, 34&gt; J993: 573""94j interprets Walther's 'Ein man verbiutet ane pfliht' in its relationship to Reinmar's Song x. A. V. Murray, ASNS, 230, 1993: 365-71, argues that Walther's 'Owe daz wisheit unde jugint' (83, 1) does not necessarily indicate that Reinmar was dead. F. Urbanek, DVLG, 67, 1993: 221-51, interprets Walther, L. 84, 22, in terms of crusading politics. Alfred Mundhenk, Walthers Zuhorer and andere Beitrage zur Dichtung der Stauferzeit, Wiirzburg, Konigshausen &amp; Neumann, 1993, 168 pp., includes, besides revised reprints of a study of Walther from 1963 (39-72, with a response to the criticisms of J. Knape) and a rejection of W.'s authorship of the 'elegy' from 1970 (73-115), a wide-ranging characterization of the poet as performer in the context of his courtly milieu (9-38). J.-P. Lefebvre, Fourquet Vol., 149-50, translates the 'elegy' into French. T. Bein, Beitrage (Bam berg), 115-21, studies a pseudo-Walther printed in Lachmann's preface of 1827. There is discussion of proposed new editions of lyric texts in Beitrage (Bamberg) by M. Barmann (Goli, 109-14), A. Eder and S. Pod roschko (Neidhart, 123-37), D. Schmidtke (Magnus von Anhalt, 149-56), and E. Wunderle (anonymous Meisterlieder, 157-63). D. Buschinger, Actes (Amiens), 11, 43-48, defines some of the features of minne in lyrics of the 13 th and 14th cs. P. Marcq, Fourquet Vol., 151-55, translates two songs of Wolfram into French. I. Ten Venne, Actes (Amiens), 11, 177-86, studies Neidhart's conception of love. M.-S. Masse, Fourquet Vol., 157-69, studies the Wolfram reception in the Wartburgkrieg. A. Mundhenk, Walthers Zuhorer (see this page above), includes (117-44) a close reading of Freidank's Acre strophes which relates them intimately to the poet's situation on Frederick IPs crusade, and (145-67) a similarly biographical treatment of Winsbecke, viewing it as a series of Spruche rather than a single didactic poem. H. Kischkel, ASNS, 231: 359-69, studies Reinmar von Brennenberg. Gesine Liibben, cIch singe daz wir alle werden vol.' Das Steinmar-GEuvre in der Manesseschen Liederhandschrift, Stuttgart, M &amp; P, 241 pp., is one of a series of detailed interpretations of later lyric poets from the Constance school of Christa Ortmann, founded on the insight that, so far from marking a decline in immediate relevance of the courtly lyric and its values, the emergence of the written manuscript tradition in the late 13th c. points to a re-evaluation of the genre. The theoretical essay introducing the work is substantial, beginning with Hugo Kuhn, taking subsequent work on the later Minnesang into account, and including sections on Walther, whose detached perspective is seen as marking the decisive change in the genre, Neidhart, and Wolfram. The relative structuring of the three great collective manuscripts is also seen as significant for the</page><page sequence="42">754 German Studies understanding of the function of the genre. The illustration of MS C plays a part in the discussion of the texts, and the concluding attempt to set up a profile of the poet attaches much importance to his conception of froide and to his reception by contemporaries, notably Hadlaub and Ulrich von Winterstetten. Gabriele Paule, Der Tanhuser. Organisationsprinzipien der Werkuberlieferung in der Manesseschen Liederhandschrift, Stuttgart, M &amp; P, 354 pp., is a companion volume to that of Liibben: indeed, so closely is the approach to the later lyric conceived as a collective effort that the introductory chapters in the two works are identical in every particular. Treatment of Tannhauser is made difficult by problems of authenticity and the different poetic figures presented in the different sources, but P. is able to turn this diversity to advantage in her detailed analyses of the texts and the quest for the various poetic roles. An obvious weakness of the approach lies in the temptation to read too much into the possibly arbitrary order of strophes in the manuscripts and the interpretation of the miniature illustration of the poet. M. Barmann, JOWG, 7, 1992-93: 25-41, writes on the Basle poet Goli and his family. Ralf-Henning Steinmetz, Liebe als universales Prinzip bei Frauenlob. Ein volkssprachlicher Weltentwurf in der europaischen Dichtung um 1300 (MTU, 106), ix + 182 pp., is a concise dissertation by a pupil of Karl Stackmann which, while rooted in textual analysis, effectively claims for F.'s thought a signihcance transcending that of other German poets of his time. S. is at pains to emphasize that his subject is not simply the previously treated one of F.'s 'conception of love', since minne is understood to signify a world-spirit or universal principle in nature and creation. The text on which the thesis is based is the neglected 'Minne und Welt', while portions of the Minneleich and Marienleich are also significant. The intrinsic difficulty of the language and the fact that 'Minne und Welt' survives only in a single manuscript indicate for S. an essentially esoteric body of thought. The key to the dehnition of love as a universal cosmic power ? S. notes differences from the thought of Aquinas in this regard ? is found in the I2th-c. school of Chartres, and the thesis is seen to build on C. Huber's work on the influence of Alan of Lille (see YWMLS, 50: 695), but S. is extremely reticent in suggesting how F., a poet not a philosopher, might have received his ideas. J.Janota, ABAG, 38-39: 213-22, examines the significance of 'Der vogt von Rotenburch' in the Budapest lyric fragment. B. Schnell, ASNS, 230, 1993: 261-78, demonstrates the relevance of the medical collective MS Salzburg M III 3 for the Colmar Song Manuscript. D. Huschenbett, BGDSL, 116: 412-27, studies a fragmentary love-song from a lost Danzig MS. Also noted: Die Sammlung von Meisterliedern in der Heidelberger Handschrift cpg 680, ed. and comm.

Kritischer Text nach den Handschriften, ed. Dagmar Gottschall and Georg Steer (TTG, 35), x 4- 138* 4- 343 pp., fills a significant lacuna with a new edition that finally replaces that of F. Heidlauf. The editors identify 82 MSS besides references in medieval library catalogues and 89 early printed versions. The account of the immensely complicated textual history is itself evidence of the importance of the work as an independent vernacular creation, and leads to the selection of the Berlin MS Bi as Leithandschrift for the edition, which with its arrays of variants can be regarded as a reliable source for the numerous detailed references in MHG literature influenced by the Lucidarius. A particularly striking feature of the new edition is G.'s treatment of the vocabulary: far from mere indexes there are complete dictionaries of the German and the Latin words, with parsing, grammatical information, translation, full references, and indications of the source in Honorius Augustodunen sis, Rupert of Deutz, or William of Conches as appropriate. The edition and stemma are discussed further by G. in Beitrdge (Bam berg), 269-76. C. Huber, Wisbey Vol., 27-38, reaffirms his view that Thomasin von Zerclaere adopted the theory c&amp;integumentum, while D. Rocher, Ada (Passau), 325?43, considers the motivation for his Der Wdlsche Gast in the context of the patronage of Wolfger von Erla, and M. Zips, Actes (Amiens), 111, 171-86, examines Thomasin's concep tion of the nobility of the soul. L. Gompf, MJ, 28, 1993:47-60, associates Cologne and the number eleven with Ysengrimus. Heinrich der Glichesaere, Fuchs Reinhart, trans. Danielle Buschinger and Jean-Marc Pastre (Reinekes Taschenbuch-Reihe, 5), Greifswald, Reineke, 1993, xii + 41 pp., is a translation into French. Aspects of Reinhart Fuchs are discussed in Beitrdge (Kalamazoo) by W. Spiewok (the background to Heinrich der Glichezaere's work, to Reynke de vos, and related beast epics, 1-9); D.

Michael Schilling (UB, 658), 206 pp., presents a semi-diplomatic edition of the previously unedited Heidelberg MS with a line-by-line translation on facing pages which, it is emphasized, is intended merely as a guide to the original. With abbreviations written out and a modest amount of punctuation added, the latter is remarkably easy to read. Besides commentary, bibliography and introduction S. adds the text of'Der Schwank von der Messe' and Eutenspieget, chapter 17. W. Hofmeister, Mediaevistik, 5, 1992 [1994]: 71-77? interprets Strieker's Die einge mauerte Frau. In Haug, Kleinstformen, B. Wachinger (1-37) takes a broad view of the form, typology, and history of proverbs, riddles, aphorisms, characterizing some late-medieval examples in particu lar; K. Grubmuller (38-55) characterizes the work of Freidank; G. Dicke (56-90) traces the theme of'Mich wundert, das ich so frolich pin' in the face of certain death at an uncertain hour through such literature with fascinating results; M. Eikelmann (91-116) analyses the development of the context and mode of transmission of medieval German proverbs; and T. Tomasek (216-34) surveys the tradition of joke questions from the Joca Monachorum onwards. E. M. Jacobson, ColGer, 26, 1993: 201?10, argues that Wernher der Gartenaere in Helmbrecht affirms the value of the classical literary 'canon', a point of which only an astute audience will be aware, and B. Sowinski, Fest. Lemmer, 117-27, studies the peasant usurpation in Helmbrecht of courtly motifs from Wolfram's Parzival. Alfred J. Hubler, Stdndetexte des Mittelalters. Analysen zur Intention undkognitiven Struktur (BSDSL, 66), 1993, 216 pp., detects patterns of thought in several didactic texts. Peter G. Bietenholz, Historia and Fabula. Myths and Legends in Historical Thought from Antiquity to the Modern Age (Brill's Studies in Intellectual History, 59), Leiden, Brill, xii + 434 pp. 4- 9 pis, includes examples of the interaction of fact and fiction in medieval historiography and legend. On chronicle literature, we note Jorn-Uwe Gunther, Die illustrierten mittelhochdeutschen Weltchronikhandschriften in Versen: Katalog der Handschriften und Einordnung der Illustrationen in die Bilduberlieferung (Tuduv-Studien. Reihe Kunstgeschichte, 48), Munich, Tuduv, 1993, 679 pp. K. Gartner, Wisbey Vol., 55-81, makes the Thuringian Christherre-Chronik the basis of a demonstration of computer-based editing techniques; Id., Fest. Lemmer, 65-85, seeks to identify the patrons of the work. G. Dunphy, ABAG, 40: 139-57, studies the treatment of Frederick II in Jansen Enikel's universal chronicle, and C. Lecouteux, Fest.

Zweisprachige Geschichtsschreibung im spdtmittel alterlichen Deutschland, ed. Rolf Sprandel (WM, 14), 1993, 516 pp. J. Heinzle, Heinzle, Mittelalter, 266-94, places the study of the just judge in some 13th-c. texts at the heart of an account of the crucial role of Franciscan piety in literary production. D. Schmidtke, Gottzmann, Unerkannt, 59-78, notes prose works from the territory of the Teutonic Order. The accounts of proposed new editions in Beitrage (Bamberg) include work by K. Gartner (Bruder Philipp's Marienleben, 33-41), A. Rapp (the prose version of the same, 219-24), K. Gartner, R. Plate, and M.

Riidiger Blumrich, Marquard von Lindau. Deutsche Predigten. Untersuchungen und Edition (TTG, 34), x + 93* + 325 pp., fills an important lacuna in I4th-c. studies with the first critical edition of the 41 German sermons of 1389. Building on important recent scholarship, the full introduction reviews current knowledge on M.'s life and work, expounds the transmission and textual history, characterizes the sermons in terms of their relation ship to the Latin works, formal, structural, thematic, and functional aspects, and reviews the sources with a view to determining their theological significance. The understanding and reception of Eckhart are found to be crucial in establishing M.'s place in Franciscan intellectual history. The problems of a critical edition have been alleviated by the known activity of the scribe of the Leithandschrift of 1430, Anna Jack. A. Schnyder, ZD A, 123: 55-75, edits Jakob Sprenger's sermon on St John the Evangelist (1465). Peter Dinzelbacher, Christliche Mystik im Abendland. Ihre Geschichte von den Anfdngen bis zum Ende des Mittelalters, Paderborn, Schoningh, 463 pp., is another work on mysticism by an author who is now an acknowledged authority on the subject. D. emphasizes that his introductory history differs from others by taking account of the relevant historical background, by avoiding value-judgements (although the sections on heretical mystics are a welcome inclusion!),</page><page sequence="46">758 German Studies and above all by focusing on experiendal rather than speculative mysticism, and hence on the dominant role of women in the former. D. writes with his characteristic engaging clarity, from the initial definition of what does and does not constitute mysticism, by way of chapters on the biblical basis, other forces which influenced the early Church, the Greek Fathers, the early and high Middle Ages, and the 13th, 14th, and 15th cs. Although the discussions of individual mystics are necessarily brief, the net is cast wide and instances of mysticism are recorded among quite unexpected writers. A final chapter surveys the broader adoption of mystical themes in literature, sermon, and art. O. Langer, ZDP, 113, Sonderheft: 83-115, makes a critique of a number of historical accounts of mysticism. In Bernhard von Clairvaux. Rezeption und Wirkung im Mittelalter und in der Neuzeit, ed. Kaspar Elm (Wolfenbiitteler Mittelalter-Studien, 6), Wiesbaden, Harrassowitz, v + 436pp., G. Steer writes on St Bernard as an authority for the mystics. Susanne Kobele, Bilder der unbegriffenen Wahrheit. Zur Struktur mystischer Rede im Spannungsfeld von Latein und Volkssprache (BG, 30), 1993, 210 pp., is an important Munich dissertation on the relationship of Latin and German, the chief significance of which perhaps lies less in what K. has to say about the mystics than in her convincing demonstration that the vernacular texts establish a tradition of metaphorical usage independent of the Latin ? a conclusion certainly of significance for other genres. There are concise introductory chapters with interesting reviews of mystic texts reflecting on the use of the vernacular and attempts to clarify the terminological confusion in the discussion of image, metaphor, and allegory. Central to the study are Mechthild von Magdeburg's imagery derived from the Song of Songs, contrasted with Gertrud von Helfta and Mechthild von Hackeborn, and, most telling of all, the comparison of Latin and vernacular sermons of Eckhart. G. Vollmann-Profe, ZDP, 113, Sonderheft: 144-58, makes the serial publication of Mechthild von Magdeburg's Flieftendes Licht der Gottheit the basis of a study of her subsequent changes in presentation in response to readers' reactions. Loris Sturlese, Meister Eckhart. Ein Portrdt (Eichstatter Hochschulreden, 90), Regensburg, Pustet, 1993, 27 pp., supplies a concise but very coherent survey of E.'s work and achievement and the associated problems in terms of his personal development. There are brief sections on the major theological and philosophical themes, and due account is taken of the vernacular sermons. S. Kobele, ZDP, 113, Sonderheft: 190-206, studies Eckhart's approach to grammar, while B. Hasebrink, ib., 207-22, introduces an important commentary from Rebdorf on E.'s sermon on poverty, and F. Iohn, ib., 223-44, studies the functional relationship between E.'s German sermons and his theology.

Loris Sturlese and Rudiger Blumrich (PBib, 458), 1993, lxvii 4- 90 pp., rightly claims to be an unusual addition to a series of philosophical texts which will also render a service to Germanistik. The critical edition, following textual studies by the Wurzburg school, follows the reliable Strasbourg MS, and B.'s translation on facing pages is easy to read and a helpful guide to the meaning of the technical terms in their context. S.'s introduction is substantial, emphasizing the philosophical nature of the work in a wide-ranging analysis. There are notes, bibliography, and full indexes of names and sources.

Enders (139-72) examines his mystical knowledge, and U. Williams (172-88) his treatment of didactic sources; R. Blumrich (189-201) reviews work on the transmission of his German works; W. J. Hoffmann (202-54) presents the vernacular reception of the Horologium sapientiae in the Devotio Moderna; and B. Boge (255-66) points to the signihcance of the background to the Cologne 1661 edition of his works. Bl. Henry Suso, Wisdom's Watch upon the Hours, trans. Edmund Colledge (The Fathers of the Church. Mediaeval Continuation, 4), Washington, D. C, Catholic University of America Press, xiv + 346 pp., is an admirably clear and readable English translation of the Horologium Sapientiae, a work of which no MHG version appeared. The reasons for this are convincingly explained in the course of a 50-page introduction which covers numerous aspects of S.'s life and work and of the reception, circulation, audience, and thought of the Horologium and its relationship to the visual arts. A. Haas, ZDP, 113, Sonderheft: 245-72, sees the medieval unity of text and experience as fundamental to an understanding of Seuse's mystical thought.

Biirkle, ib., 116-43, emphasizes the programmatic character of the writings of the female mystics, rejecting the view that they merely reformulate women's experience. B. Lundt, Schmidtke, Wunderbare, 137-75, sees the supernatural powers with which figures in the Dialogus Miraculorum of Caesarius of Heisterbach are endowed as relevant to sexual identity, and W.

The subject is vividly characterized with examples of major medieval saints' lives, the relationship of saints to family, society, and the official authority of the Church, miracles, legends, and canonization. K. Herbers supplies an appendix on the specifically German aspects of the theme. Dieter von der Nahmer, Die lateinische Heiligenvita.

The codicological section mentions six MS versions and a Magdeburg print of 1500, here reproduced in facsimile (pp. 81-120). The edition is based on the Bielefeld text as Leit handschrift, and includes full critical apparatus and the Latin version of the legend which either forms the source or appears to stand very close to it. A glossary is a further aid to use. P. Strohschneider, Gutenberg unddieNeue Welt (see p. 770 below), pp. 159-69, discusses the 'Reise' version of the MHG legend of St Brendan. P.

Nigel Harris, The Latin and German sEtymachia\ Textual History, Edition, Commentary (MTU, 102), ix + 466 pp., opens a new vista in the held of late-medieval beast allegory. The neglected I4th-c. text, of which four I5th-c. German versions survive, contains interpretations of the animals on which the personified seven deadly sins and seven virtues ride into battle and of other animal hgures on the helmet, shield, and tunic of each. H. supplies the basis of all future study: a transcription of the Latin text, editions of the three vernacular versions, with a full account of the codicology and textual transmission. A commentary occupies pp. 265?418 and fulfils its aim of being a work of reference on the zoological and allegorical data in its own right. There is a wealth of reference to literature on beast symbolism and to medieval analogues, the latter being sufficiently detailed for Thomas of Cantimpre's De natura rerum to be identified as the principal source. Rainer Meisch, Troja unddieReichsstadtNbrdlingen. Studien zum cBuch von Troja3 (1390/92) des Hans Mair (WM, 18), ix 4- 386 pp., is a Wiirzburg dissertation which at once clarifies the relationship of M.'s work to the Historia destructionis Troiae of Guido de Columnis and adds to knowledge of the contemporary background to the work and its function. There is much on the place of origin of the work, the person of the author, the approach to translation in the period and comparisons with other MHG renderings of Guido. The detailed account of M.'s treatment of various rhetorical forms found in his original, together with its didacticism, leads to an interpretation connecting the work with the civic and political situation in Nordlingen. A hnal chapter deals with the transmission and reception of the work. This book is an important chapter in the much-needed history of the German reception of the</page><page sequence="51">Medieval Literature 763 matter of Troy. A.

Klaus Grubmuller (ATB, 107), xxxii +101 pp., is a near-diplomatic edition of the hrst German prose collection of fables, dated before 1412, from the 'Vienna school' of translations. The 63 fables include 39 of the 42 of Avianus. Intended as devotional reading for the laity, each fable usually includes an introductory admonition about its didactic purpose, and a conclud ing passage of allegorical interpretation. There is full critical documentation of each text with source and bibliography. A.

Touber, Colloque (Mont-Saint-Michel), 103-11, notes dragons in the religious drama. W. Mezger, Heinzle, Mittelalter, 209-43, demonstrates the breadth of the social spectrum participating in the religious drama and the inadequacy of the cliche of 'popular culture' in this context. Andreas Kotte, Theatralitdt im Mittelalter. Das Halberst'ddter Adamsspiel (MFDT, 10), 243 pp., is less concerned with drama as such than with liturgical history. The 'Adam' in question is the name given to a public penitent in Halberstadt in the 14th-16th cs, driven out of the church at Quadragesima in the role of the original sinner to live as a beggar, and reinstated on Maundy Thursday. There is a wealth of interesting documentation on the subject, as also on public penance in general, the scapegoat, the dramatic tradition in Halberstadt, and the Old French Adam play, although the attempt to link all the material through a psychological and sociological conception of the 'theatrical' remains problematic.

Die Anfdnge des abendldndischen Wissens, trans. Bettina Obrecht, Stuttgart ? Weimar, Metzler, xiii + 482 pp., is, in spite of its lurid title, a translation of L.'s highly reputable The Beginnings of Western Science. The success of the book is rightly identified in its ability to review the development of Classical and medieval science and scholarship as an integrated whole. Philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, education, the role of Islam, and the total theological context all receive their due, and the result is a remarkable synthesis of recent scholarship, represented in a 30-page bibliography now supplemented with four more pages for the German edition. Wissen fur den Hof. Der spdtmittel alterliche Verschriftlichungsprozefi am Beispiel Heidelberg im 15. Jahrhundert, ed. Jan-Dirk Muller (MMS, 67), 407 pp., is further evidence of the important stimulus to research in specialized and technical literature now being given by the pragmatic approach of the Miinster school. The subject-matter, harmonized by full bibliography and indexes of names and manuscripts, focuses on the intellectual and scientihc activity at the late-medieval Heidelberg court. After a detailed introduction to the approach by J.-D. Muller (7-28), U. von Bloh (29-120) supplies a substantial monograph, with catalogue, on the library of Mathias von Kemnat. J.-D. Muller has three further contributions, introducing the translations of Albertus Magnus by Werner Ernesti and Heinrich Munsinger (121-68), comparing the roles of orator and scribe in Peter Luder's panegyric on Frederick the Victorious, Mathias von Kemnat's chronicle, and Michel Beheim's Pfdlzer Reimchronik (289-321), and studying Hans Leckiichner's fencing manual in the context of its genre. T. Berg and U. Friedrich (169-232) explain the transmission of knowledge in Konrad Kyeser's Bellifortis and in the anonymous Feuerwerkbuch, and U. von Bloh and T. Berg (233-87) show how a manuscript intended for a prince's use could combine a range of practical information with a prayer book. W. Rohe (323-54) analyses the structure of some medical treatises.

A helpful clarification of the different terms for different types of school precedes a geographical and quantitative survey of the schools, and the section on the organization of the schools and their pupils and teachers includes a chapter on the curriculum which confirms, but also exemplifies, the recent work of</page><page sequence="54">766 German Studies N.

J. also contributes pp. 117-28 to Bildungs- und schulgeschichtliche Studien zu Spdtmittelalter, Reformation und konfessionellem Zeitalter, ed. Harald Dickerhof (WM, 19), 317 pp. The 14 substantial contributions deriving from a Wurzburg-Eichstatt project aim to trace by way of school and university records the education explosion from the late 14th c. to 1600 which effectively accompanied the transition from a largely oral to a written culture. Of particular interest for the background to the literature of our period are the essays of E. Schubert (itinerant scholars, 9-34), H. Solinsky (the educational consequences of ecclesiastical reform, 35-51), T. Maisel, I. Mat schinegg, and A. Miiller (Vienna University, 53-62), and K.

Christoph Terharn, Die Herforder Fehden im spaten Mittelalter. Fin Beitrag zum Fehderecht (Quellen und Forschungen zur Strafrechtsgeschichte, 6), Berlin, Schmidt, 164 pp., 1S a legal study full of information of interest for the literary treatment of the feud, even though only Helmbrecht is explicitly considered alongside the legal sources. These derive from the city of Herford, and have much on the dehnition of feud and its distinction from other forms of legally applied force, the preconditions of a feud and the circumstances of its formal declaration, the types of force used, and the manner in which a feud might exceed its legal constraints but also be suspended or ended. Bettina Kirschstein, Ursula Schulze, Sibylle Ohly, and Peter Schmitt, Schreibortverzeichnis der mittelhochdeutschen Urkundensprache, Ber lin, Schmidt, 1991, 140 pp., is an index of places of origin or, failing these, evidence of provenance, of the texts assessed for the Wbrterbuch der mittelhochdeutschen Urkundensprache. The introduction briefly explains the difficulties in compiling the index and claims a 60 per cent success rate in locating the relevant place of origin or ruler. The greater part of the volume is taken up with a numbered list of the documents which is followed by an alphabetical index of places with cross-references, making for a system which, though allowing for many rehnements in the information provided, is essentially easy to use. E. Skala, Fest. Bauer, 13-27, cites a number of civic documents in a study of the language of I4th-c. Prague, and A.

The author includes chapters with theoretical reflections on the basis of text editing and palaeography, which have a somewhat pretentious ring in the context of a unique work in a single Gothic cursive hand. The substantial achievements of the study are the informative account of the historical background which explains the contents and chronology; the meticulously careful edition itself; and the equally methodical and exhaustive analysis of the script, which takes us 25</page><page sequence="58">77o German Studies through the alphabet showing admirably clear examples of each scribal form, and in itself constitutes a lesson in the palaeography of the period.

Gerd Dicke, Heinrich Steinhbwels 'Esopus' und seine Fortsetzer. Untersuchungen zu einem Bucherfolg der Fruhdruckzeit (MTU, 103), ix + 564 pp., is a monumental dissertation from the Munster school of Klaus Grubmuller which is ideally suited to this series in view of the emphasis placed by the author on the reception of the Esopus, the circumstances of its distribution, and the background to its immense social impact, made all the more fascinating by the background of the transition from manuscript to print. D. sees the dissemination of the text as exemplary for the consequences of the new medium. After an introduction recapitulating research on S.'s life and work he focuses in the first part on S.'s role as compiler, editor, and translator and the background to the enormous success of his work, while as much space again is devoted to Brant's revision and additions and Johann Adelphus Muling's translation of Brant's Latin text. All this is done with meticulous attention to detail, but the second part of the thesis is perhaps the most innovative. The Esopus is regarded as a commercial product in the book-trade of the 15th and 16th cs and D. reveals an impressive array of data on sales, advertising, print runs, and pricing, besides information on the owners of the books and the relative position of the German and Latin versions. The substantial supple mentary material consists of catalogues of the editions of the text and of its owners and a stemma of the Latin transmission. The biblio graphy and indexing of the volume are of the exemplary standard associated with the MTU series. A. Faugere, Actes (Amiens), 111, 35-42, emphasizes Arnold von Harff's receptiveness and lack of prejudice, J.-M. Pastre, ib., 93-100, writes on the travelogues of Sabald Rieter and Hans Tucher, and W. Spiewok, ib., 127-32, surveys a range of works of this genre. Also noted: Europaische Reiseberichte des spaten Mittelalters. Eine analytische Bibliographie, ed.

Kohl (15-21) takes a broad brush approach to the world-view evident in travel and pilgrimage literature; H.-J. Bachorski (59-86) analyses the narrative structure of a number of I5th-c. and i6th-c. romances of adventure; and W. Rocke (87-102) focuses on the exotic and on imaginary journeys in a treatment of works printed in Augsburg in the period. G. Hayer and U. Muller, Fest. Keil, 171-93, seek to define and identify 'prison literature', starting with Boethius and placing Count</page><page sequence="60">772 German Studies Heinrich of Wurttemberg (1448-1519) at the centre of some late medieval examples. I. Ten Venne, Actes (Amiens), in, 133-43, argues that Hartmann Schedel's attitudes are largely traditional and rarely point to a new world-view. Sebastian Brant, Das Narrenschiff. Faksimile der Erstausgabe Basel 1494 mit dem Nachwort von Franz Schultz (Strafiburg 1912), ed. Dieter Wuttke (Saecvla Spiritalia, 6), Baden-Baden, Koerner, xxxiv + 327 4- lvi pp., is an immensely useful work, sup plying a need which in spite of the many new text editions and reproduction in part or full of the illustrations has not in recent times been fulfilled: a facsimile of the complete hrst edition, which will immediately facilitate study of the work for which perhaps more than any other the visual impact and the interdependence of text and woodcut are crucial. W. makes the old facsimile of F. Schultz the basis of the volume, but the present volume is far more than a mere reprint, for comparison with the original has led W. to make a number of changes which are explained and documented in the modest but highly informative introduction. Die Holzschnitte zu Sebastian Brants 'Narrenschiff3. 121 Bildtafeln, ed. Manfred Lemmer (IB, 593), viii + 158 pp., is a welcome reissue of this handy collection of the woodcuts which hrst appeared in 1964. The quality of the paper and of the reproduction has been improved and the introductory material marginally revised. D. Lettieri, GJ, 69: 95-105, writes on aspects of the illustration ofthe Narrenschiff, and S. Heimann-Seelbach, JOWG, 7, 1992?93: 219?26, points to Brant's fusion of figurative and realistic utterance, while J. Knape, ib., 293-303, comments on the genesis of the work in Basle, and S. B. Pafenberg, Classen, Canon, 163-74, considers Brant's conception of wisdom, asserting its dependence on biblical wisdom literature. Finally, P. Reimen, GerLux, 5, 1993: 1?13, documents a pamphlet of Brant.</page></plain_text>
