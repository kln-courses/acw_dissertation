In Volume VI of the American Journal of Archaeology Mr. Arthur Fairbanks published an excellent article on the subject, which serves as a natural point of de- parture for a new dis- cussion. Mr. Fairbanks pro- poses for this relief the assumption that the sculptor copied the fig- ure of Athena from some famous statue in the round.2 lIe assents to Graef's view a that the style is that of the Attic School of the early fifth century under strong Peloponnesian in- fluence, and supposes the FIGURE 1. -TIlE " IOURNING ATIIENA." 1 See A.J.A.

BENNETT original to have been a statue of the type of the Vesta Giustiniani. The inclination of the head, he thinks, may have been original, or it may be part of the adaptation. To the "received opinion" that the pillar, toward which the goddess bends her head, rep- resents an inscribed stele,1 Mr. Fairbanks raises the objection that a pillar of this type is very rarely 2 used for inscriptions. Lechat's 3 theory that Athena is looking at a figure originally painted, not carved, on the top of the pillar, representing Erichthonius as a serpent issuing from a cista, Fairbanks finds weak, in that there is "no analogy for a column without some sort of capital on which the cista might rest." He follows Graef in believing that the bowed head denotes gracious good- will rather than mourning. The new interpretation which he proposes is in his explanation of the pillar, which he takes to be the meta or goal-post, the symbol of the palaestra. This type of pillar on vases, he says, "ordinarily denotes the meta." He cites four instances4 and adds "that the goddess of the Academy and of the Panathenaea should be thought of as pre- siding over the palaestra, is at Athens not at all unnatural." He then goes on to publish a lecythus with white slip, one of those found in Euboea, 1880-90, now in the National Museum at Athens, 1968 (960). The figure painted on this - an Athena, bare-headed, wearing the aegis, resting on her spear advanced in her left hand, and holding herself in a pose very like that of the goddess in our relief-- may give some slight support to the theory which he states in his first paragraph, that the relief is an adaptation from a statue in the round.5 This series of vases may be dated somewhere near the middle of the fifth I Inscribed with names of dead Athenians, over whom Athena is mourning, J.H.

The evidence furnished by this vase belongs to such a train of reasoning. There was (it has now disappeared) in the museum at Argos an adapted copy inrelief of the Doryphorus of Polyclitus. See Collignon, Histoire de ta Sculpture Grecque, Vol. I, 1892, p. 491, where an illustration accompanies the text. Mr. Fairbanks might have strengthened his argument by citing this.</page><page sequence="3">THE SO-CALLED MOURNING ATHENA 433 century B.c. Fairbanks holds that the vase-painter and the maker of the relief worked at about the same time, each deriv- ing his inspiration from a famous free-standing statue which belonged to the period of Peloponnesian influence on Athe- nian sculpture. Thus he accounts for the archaic character of the relief. It should be noted that, in the scene depicted on the lecythus, a tall, slender "temple column" appears behind the goddess. In this Fairbanks sees a suggestion that the original was a temple statue. That the "Mourning Athena" is an adaptation in relief of some famous statue executed in the early years of the fifth century B.C. certainly seems probable. I agree with Graef and Fairbanks in believing that Athena is here not represented as sorrowful. But, after making the admission with Fairbanks that the pillar in the relief is neither an inscribed stele nor a column originally surmounted by a painted figure, is it possible to believe with him that this is the meta? Granted that this form of pillar "ordinarily denotes the meta . . . on vases," 1 does not the unwonted connection of Athena with the palaestra, even in her beloved Athens, make as "large demands on the imagination" as Lechat's view, or Graef's, or E. A. Gardner's ? The theory which I propose involves no overt short-hand symbolism. The pillar does not stand for Athenian dead, Athenian wealth, or Athenian athletes. Symbolism, however, which looks back to the dim past out of which Hellenic civili- zation grew, may be found here, according to my theory, which explains the pillar as the aniconic representation of Athena. It is necessary, then, to prove that a pillar is frequently associated with the figure of Athena in Greek art. 1. Varvakeion statuette of Athena Parthenos, National Museum at Athens (Fig. 2).2 The presence of a pillar here, in the shape of an unfluted Doric column on which the goddess rests her right hand, is important, inasmuch as it gives reason to believe that such a column was similarly placed in the chryselephantine statue by Phidias. The argument, long since familiar, runs as fol- lows: This Varvakeion statuette, dating probably from the 1 Fairbanks cites only four examples. 2 Stals, Cat.

Therefore we may infer that the copyist had FIGURE 2.- THIE VARVAKEION ATHENA. authority for this column. Neither Pausanias I nor Pliny 2 mentions such a detail; but this objection need not weigh heavily, for neither of those descriptions is exhaustively complete, nor does the one adequately supple- ment the other. The point which is urged to the best advantage by those who are unwilling to regard the column as a part of the conception of Phidias, is one of aesthetics. They deny to the column any other func- tion than that of furnishing support to the outstretched arm strained with the weight of the Nike figure. There- fore they maintain that the column - whose appearance here argues its presence in the statue copied - was added to the great cult statue at some time after its completion, when repairs had become necessary. To this objec- tion it may be replied that this is not the only copy of the Parthenos statue which shows the column. It appears also on: (1) An Attic has-relief of Athena Parthenos from the fourth century B.C., in the Berlin Museum.3 (2) An Athenian lead tessera on which is Athena IPar- thenos.4 On a coin from Cilicia, of the fourth century B.c., bearing as type this figure, the column is replaced by a tree- trunk, showing, according to Collignon, misconception of its meaning.5 1 Paus.

The late Mr. A. S. Murray2 considered the evidence of this gem an important contribution to the argument that a pillar was present in the Athena Parthenos statue by Phidias. The intaglio de- sign on the gem represents that type of the goddess. Beneath the hand on which Nike is borne is a pillar or cippus, so short that it furnishes no support whatever. On this pillar is perched Athena's owl. Even so, cippus and owl together do not reach as high as the outstretched hand. Murray believes that the owl and cippus "we must retain as part of the original design of Phidias, and as probably being the source of the IFIGrcn IENGr A~vEi) Gi~;t. pillar which the copyist has introduced into the Varvakeion statuette." He does not suggest any meaning for this cippus." We have, then, from four sources monumental evidence of the presence of a pillar in the Athena IParthenos statue.4 There remains an important piece of literary evidence to consider.

Collignon does not cite this gem. 2 Op. cit. pp. 136-138. 3 Murray's theory given above he offers as an alternative to the opinion that the column in the Varvakeion statuette is a conventionalized olive tree, used for support to the hand. 4 It may be a point worthy of note that in no extant copy of the chryselephan- tine statue of Zeus at Olympia does a column appear, although the technical problem of support for the hand bearing a figure was the same as in the Athena statue. Of serious warping in this Zeus statue we have evidence from the com- mission to repair it which Damnaphon of Messene received. The argument may not be pressed, for monumental sources for the study of this statue are few. 5 See Rheinisches Museum, 1883, p. 311. SThese inscriptions are cited by Jahn and Michaelis in Arx.

Certainly it seems reasonable to suppose that Phidias put his signature on some p)ortionl of his statue rather than on some bronze pillar or tablet ini the " Parthenon" or "Il ecaltom- pedon."

If it may be proved that a pillar is of ancient cult significance, what more fitting than that it should have had a place in this statue, which was adorned with every conceiv- able symbol of the worshlip of the goddess? 2 I believe that in the Athena l'ar- thenos by Phidias there was a column placed, not for purposes of support, beneath the outstretched right hand. A pillar in columnar form is found in four copies of tlhe Athena Parthenos statue: 1. Varvakeion statuette; 2. Attic fourth century bas-relief; 3. Athenian tes- sera; 4. Greek gem with intaglio design. It will be seen by the list, as continued below, that the pillar is not confined to monu- ments of the Parthenos type. 5.

The exquisite carv- ing and modelling of the marble bear the characteristics of Attic relief work of the early years of the fourth century. The goddess is shown in profile, facing toward the right of the field. She stands resting her riglht hand on her hip. Bare-headed she is gazing thoughtfully at her helmet, held in her left hand. Leaning against her left knee is her shield, behind which stands a pillar or post, not waist-high, adorned with a simple Doric capital. The shaft is partially concealed by the shield, so that it is difficult to make out whether the pillar is square or circular in section. It is more probably the former. On this pillar an owl perches. In the extreme right of the field is an olive tree, represented by thin, twisted branches extending to some height. The presence of a pillar in this relief is, as previously stated, remarkably interesting. It stands quite apart from the figure of the goddess. Therefore there is not the slightest possibility that, in some free-standing statue which the maker of this relief may have copied, the pillar had any kind of supporting function. Nor did the artist intend it for a conventional representation of the olive tree, for that gift of Athena appears in its natural form beside the pillar. The ploint is not to be evaded. HIere the pillar, like helmet, shield, olive, and owl, is manifestly an attribute. 6.

To her right, in the left of the field, is the pillar, a round column 1 L. R. Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, 1896, Vol. I, p. 347, pl.

Further to the left, beyond the pillar, is the olive tree. This coin-type is by some associated with the eastern pediment of the Parthenon, by others, with the western.1 Miss Jane Harrison, in commenting2 on the relief, points out the general likeness of the Athena, especially in pose, to the statuette in the National Museum at Athens known as the Epidaurus Athena statuette.3 The Athena on this medallion differs widely from the pensive bare-headed Athena Nike in Lansdowne House. But here as there the pillar is a conspicuous detail. Here as there it is impossible to account for it as an architectonic accessory in a statue or as a conventionalized olive tree. 7. Coin of Athens showing Athena Nikephoros (Fig. 6).4 The same pillar and owl appear on a coin of Athens of a class which, according to Furtwringler in Roscher's Lexicon, A~TIE~NIANU COIN. s.v. Athene, originated in the fourth century. Athena stands to the right of the field, in profile, her right side turned toward the spec- tator. She is clad in the usual Doric chiton, wears her helmet, in her right hand bears Nike, in her left thle spear. In front of her, to the right of the field, is coiled her serpent. Behind her is the pillar surmounted by the owl. Of this class of figures, the Athena Nikephoros type, there is an example in the Pallas of Velletri in the Louvre. 8. Series of Panathenaic Amphorae (Fig. 7). The bird on the pillar at once suggests the famous series of Panathenaic prize vases. Uniformly on Panathenaic amphorae Athena Promachos is shown on the obverse panel advancing to the left. On either side of her, except in the earliest examples, is a slender Doric column, as tall as the goddess herself, sur- mounted usually by a cock. Sometimes, however, in place of the cock appears I a sphinx, a panther, a siren, or a vase.

These symbolic fig- ures remove the possibility of explaining the two columns here, as elsewhere in vase-painting, as a means of indicating a temple structure. The cock, which usually surmounts the columns, has been explained as the bird of the games.1 This is hardly satisfactory. Cer- tainly the cock was a common votive offer- ing among the Greeks.2 Furthermore we meet him in the cult of As- clepius.3 And if the cock symbolizes the Pan- athenaic Games, ought not sphinx, panther, si- ren, Triptolemus, Nike, or vase to serve a simi- lar purpose?

BENNETT there is behind the Athena figure a single slender Doric column as lofty as the two columns on the Panathenaic amphorae. Mr. Fairbanks says,' "The column is a familiar convention of the vase painter to indicate a temple and suggests that we are dealing with a temple statue." This may be very true. At the same time it is unusual to find a column on a vase with a single figure. Be this as it may, too much importance is not to be attached to the evidence of this vase in this particular. It is cited here, since the previous discussion of the vase raises the question. 10. Gem representing Athena and Zeus.2 This gem Farnell cites 3 in illustration of the Athena Hygieia type. He remarks that, while it is a very inferior representa- tion, it "seems to be trustworthy." The slight doubt implied in this statement makes it desirable to use the gem with caution. Before a seated Zeus figure stands a woman, hel- meted, clad in Doric chiton. On her right hand, outstretched as in the Parthenos and Nikephoros types, is balanced the snake of Hygieia. Beneath the arm is a plain Doric column. It would seem that in the preceding passages examples have been given in sufficient number to make profitable an investi- gation of this pillar which appears on these Athena monuments. A pillar has been found with the following types of this goddess :- 1. Athena Parthenos. 2. Athena Nike. 3. Running Athena - connected with pediments of Parthenon. 4. Athena Nikephoros. 5. Athena Promrnachos. 6. Athena Hygieia. 7. "Mourning" Athena. This pillar has been seen to be an attribute of the goddess, not an architectonic detail or a conventionalized tree. It is probably significant that with it are associated various symbols of Athena, - the owl, sphinx, panther, serpent, vase, and Nike figure. 1 A.J.A.

XVIII, C.</page><page sequence="11">THE SO-CALLED MOURNING ATHENA 441 It is not unnatural to turn to the painted vases for some clew to the meaning of this pillar. Waiters gives a list1 of types of Athena which appear on Greek vases, of which series two2 have bearings here: (1) Athena between two lions, on early vases; (2) Athena represented in xoanon form. The first of these types finds a parallel in Mycenaean monu- ments, on which frequently a divinity appears adored or guarded by lions, arranged one on either side. The "Lions' Gateway" at Mycenae is a conspicuous example, if Dr. Arthur Evans has correctly traced the development of this group on Mycenaean monuments in his valuable article3 on "Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult." The existence of such a cult he proves by exam- ples from extant remains. The process of development, he finds, seems to have been as follows: first comes the idea of the tree as the vehicle of divine presence. Then this sacred tree is conventionalized into a pillar, a baetylic form of deity, the "pillar of the house." The pillar is uniformly of that peculiar Mycenaean shape which is supposed to have been the ancestor of the Doric column. While one pillar is the rule in this cult, Evans has found examples of two, three, and more which are baetylic.4 Monsters appear in pairs in heraldic grouping with the pillar, as adorers or guardians--griffins, sphinxes, and lions. The next step is the substitution of the anthropomorphic form of divinity for the pillar. Here the pillar is shown to be bi-sexual, for it is replaced sometimes by a male divinity, sometimes by a female. The early Athena type in Greek vase-painting is parallel to this. In that case Athena is certainly little more than a form of that ancient woman divinity, whence Miss Harrison5 traces the various goddesses of the Greeks. In the pictorial process of change the god or goddess is finally represented in human form beside the sacred tree or pillar, which, at first, was the representation of deity.6 Evans says: 7 "On cylinder seals of the Cypro- 1 Walters, op. cit.

BENNETT Mycenaean class there is also a Lion Goddess. On an example from Salamis a seated female divinity holds in her left hand a bird, perhaps a dove, and places her right on a low pillar, rep- resenting her baetylic form, behind which is a rampant lion, who, resting one paw on the pillar idol, raises the other in the act of adoration." Evans cites interesting parallels to this primitive cult among the Hebrews, and suggests that the ancient groups of stones in western Europe point to similar religious belief. Farnell 1 notes survivals of Tree and Pillar Cult in classical Greece and Italy: 1. Stone representing Thespian Eros. 2. Wood column representing Theban Dionysus. 3. Pillar in Apollo statues. 4. Omphalos of Apollo. 5. Two pillars of Arcadian Zeus on Mt. Lycaeon. 6. Square image of Zeus Neleios at Tegea. 7. Terminus at Rome. 8. Jupiter Lapis Graeco-Roman reliefs. 9. Jupiter Fagutalis 10. Ficus Ruminalis. 11. Niger Lapis of Romulus. To this list we may well add Athena. Out of these dim beginnings before the Hellenic era she must have come with many symbols which once had to do with savagery- her aegis, her owl, serpent, griffins, and sphinxes. Her temenos of the sacred olive 2 near the Erechtheum seems to point to this tree cult, as does the offering of olive oil to her.8 And surely in this pillar we have her aniconic image. Tertullian bears wit- ness to this when he says: "Quanto distinguitur a crucis stipite Pallas Attica et Ceres Raria quae sine effigie rudi palo et informi ligno prostant ?" Doubtless by the fifth century the Greeks had forgotten, if they ever knew, Athena's ancestry. In her pillar the Athenians probably saw merely a symbol of her protection. As Pindar speaks of Hector5 as Tpola iciuaxov lcrrpapj ,ctova, and as the pillar of the Lions' Gate at Mycenae 1 Cults of the Greek States, I, pp. 13 ff., and Arch. Rev. II, pp. 167 ff. 2 Cf.

The xoanon form of the goddess, mentioned by Walters as the twenty-first type in his list, is of frequent occurrence on the vases, where it represents an image or idol of the goddess. The word zoanon, as used here by Walters, denotes a statue which is a pillar or column on which the human head, arms, hands, and feet are indicated. Such a form marks the passing from the aniconic to the iconic stage in religion. It should be borne in mind that in the tale 2 of how Diomedes and Odysseus stole away the Palladium, the sacred xoanon of Troy, they were prompted to the theft by the knowledge that so they would deprive the city of its "luck." The pillar-like idol is the prop of the state. The Athena xoanon, as it appears on vases, is uniformly of the Polias type. On a red-figured lecythus in the National Museum at Athens3 appear both Athena and her xoanon. The scene depicted is the Judgment of Paris, where, curiously enough, the other two goddesses are not present. To a series of xoanon forms 4 belong two representations of Athena, cited by Farnell,5 in which the lower part of the body is in Herm shape. These are a coin of Melos and a marble relief from Melos.6 Here, too, seems to belong that peculiar Spartan type, Athena of the Brazen House,7 a strangely conventionalized figure, suggesting at once not merely a xoanon, but the Myce- naean form of pillar with top of greater diameter than base. It is now left8 to form some conjecture about the type of 1 I merely apply Mr. Evans's thought to Athena. 2 Cyclic Legend. Dictys Cret. 1, ch. 5; DIionys.

What was signified by the custom of offering votive pillars (see Rouse, op. cit. pp. 83, 94, 273, 342; Borrmann, in Jb. Arch. I. III, pp. 269 ff.) to Athena and other</page><page sequence="14">444 FLORENCE M. BENNETT Athena which we may suppose the artist of the "Mourning Athena" relief to have copied. Preliminary to this there are two words yet to be said about the pillar. First, it is neces- sary to distinguish sharply between the pillar as aniconic image and the conventionalized olive tree which sometimes appears as a tree-trunk.1 The one form it is impossible to mistake for the other, but it is easy to confuse the meaning of the two. The ancient baetyl survives in the cult as a stone pillar. Granted that the baetyl itself had its origin in the reverence paid to a sacred tree 2 as the abode of deity or as deity, the baetyl means not tree, but divinity. It develops into the anthropomorphic image, beside which it often stands, whereas the branching tree- trunk in Athena monuments represents the tree, which came to be associated with the goddess by the process of development, whereby the divinity appears in the two forms, human and bae- tylic, beside a sacred tree. The monuments discussed above, which show both baetyl and olive tree, point the way to this important distinction. The pillar in the "Mourning Athena" relief is too uncompromisingly a post to be taken for a tree. The second word to be spoken is the statement that this ancient ahiconic image, whose original meaning was lost in classical times, when it survived as a symbol, appears in several forms, - as Doric column, short or tall, as cippus, as unadorned post, and as a short post with a capital. The study which I have attempted does not pretend to be exhaustive, but it is sufficiently complete to warrant some generalizations and inferences. If we review the types of Athena in which a pillar appears, we shall find that they are these: Parthenos and its cognate, Nikephoros; Nike; Hygieia; Promachos; while the ancient xoanon, the columnar image, is deities, and of placing a pillar under votive tripods ? (Rouse, op. cit. p. 1566.) Is special meaning to be attached to the columns on which archaic female figures were mounted ? Was it possibly religious, rather than artistic, feeling which prompted the use of K6paL in place of columns as supporting members in archi- tecture ? A bare formulation of such questions is all that may be attempted here. 1 See above, Cilician coin cited by Collignon in studying Parthenos statue, published by Imhoof-Blumer and Gardner, op. cit. pl. Y, XXII. 2 Deity in primitive times was conceived as residing in a sacred stone as often as in a sacred tree. The baetyl was probably often a meteorite.</page><page sequence="15">THE SO-CALLED MOURNING ATHENA 445 best associated with the Polias type.1 Farnell2 takes the Parthenos by Phidias to have been the Polias under more peaceful aspect. The Nike,3 he says, is a kindred conception, although very differently expressed in art. Hygieia,4 he finds, was, in the two certain monuments5 which we have of that type, represented, not after a fashion corresponding to her un- warlike name, but as a martial goddess, armed in the usual way, charging in the front of battle. The running Athena on the Commodus medallion, a type associated, as we have seen, with the Parthenon pediments, is of this variety. The word Pro- machos speaks for itself. It is noteworthy that the antique ~yaXFLa on the Acropolis, the image generally called Polias, is also called Promachos6 and Poliouchos.7 It would seem then that the pillar belongs to those monuments wherein the type refers to Athena in her capacity of warder and defender of the city. And what shall we think of the Athena in our relief? She wears her helmet; therefore it isprobable that this is not Nike.s Athena Hygieia seems to have been one of the less common types of the goddess,9 and the extant copies of the type do not suggest this relief. The Parthenos of the artistic type created by the genius of Phidias is certainly not the sub- ject of our relief. Quite as clearly this is not Athena Proma- chos. The figure in the relief is very simple and maidenly. Our Athena is a Ico'py. She is that helmeted ico'py who is i) 'AOvacda ,co'pt. But she is not in battle array. She does not wear the dread aegis, nor does she carry her shield. She leans pensively on her spear, while she looks down upon her people. And in a conspicuous position is a symbol of her divinity, not her serpent, nor her owl, nor her olive, but her own aniconic image which once meant "the pillar of the house." Who other than Athena was "the pillar of the house" of Athens? Truly this may well be an artistic type of Athena Polias or Poliouchos, 1 See Jahn and Michaelis, Arx Athenarum, 1901, p. 68. 2 Op. cit.
