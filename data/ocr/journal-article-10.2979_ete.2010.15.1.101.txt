<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE An Ethics of PAying AttEntion to  AnimAls TRaCI WaRkENTIN This paper explores a philosophical praxis of paying attention, and the  importance of bodily comportment, in human-animal interactions. It  traces some of the beginnings of the notion of attentiveness as it has  arisen in contemporary Western environmental and animal ethics, and  its further development into both a philosophical approach and actual  practice as a kind of interspecies etiquette. It is informed by the kinds of  comportments of openness and responsivity found in diverse examples  of practical phenomenology. Through a wide-ranging interdisciplinary  discussion, I suggest that a praxis of attentiveness can inspire practical  applications of ethical interactions between species. Actually to respond to the cat’s response to his presence would  have required his joining that flawed but rich philosophical canon  to the risky project of asking what this cat on this morning cared  about, what these bodily postures and visual entanglements might  mean and might invite, as well as reading what people who study  cats have to say and delving into the developing knowledge of both  cat-cat and cat-human behavioral semiotics when species meet.

What, if any, is the ethical significance of paying attention to animals?  Taking a cue from Donna Haraway’s (2008) provocative new book, When  Species Meet, it seems that there is enough significance to rouse a call for  humans, particularly those who identify as philosophers and scientists, to  start attending to the animals with whom so many of our lives intersect.  The time appears ripe for a recognition of animals as complex, living be- ings, rather than as two-dimensional symbols, convenient metaphors, and  passive objects of study. While the latter have been employed to generate  an incredible amount of knowledge in the West, there is still so much to  learn from the animals themselves. Arguably, whether by naïve or aggres- sive ignorance, much has been overlooked. Haraway provides a poignant  example above when she laments that Derrida missed a privileged op- portunity to actually learn something about the cat as an individual and  about cat-human relations when he chose to attend only to his response,  to his own nudity and to abstract philosophical musings (2008, 22).  With this critique, Haraway highlights concerns which have long  been pondered in feminist philosophy regarding environmental issues and  human-animal relationships. Many have addressed ethical and epistemo- logical questions of attending to animal others and have articulated, in  myriad ways, what can generally be termed as a praxis of attentiveness.  In this paper, I trace some of the beginnings of this notion of attentive- ness as it has arisen in contemporary Western environmental and animal  ethics, including the work of Thomas Birch (1993) and Josephine Do- novan (1996), to its fairly recent development into both a philosophical  approach and actual practice as a kind of interspecies etiquette. These  latter developments are found in Val Plumwood’s “intentional stance” and  “dialogical interspecies ethics” (1993, 2002), and in Jim Cheney and An- thony Weston’s “environmental etiquette” and “ethics-based epistemol- ogy” (1999). What becomes almost immediately evident is that an ethical praxis  of paying attention requires much more than mere politeness or mildly  observing. Indeed, such acts are often precisely what we should not do,  particularly when approaching individuals of another species. Rather, the  kind of attentiveness we are concerned with here involves one’s whole  bodily comportment and a recognition that embodiment is always in rela- tion to social others, both animal and human. As such, it can be informed  102 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="3"> by the kinds of comportments of openness and responsivity found in di- verse examples of practical phenomenology, such as Kenneth Shapiro’s  “phenomenological method of kinesthetic empathy” (1985, 1990, 1997),  Thomas Csordas’ “somatic modes of attention” (1993), and Elizabeth  Behnke’s “interkinaesthetic comportment” (1997). Together, they strongly  suggest that embodiment enables the expression of ethical comportment  toward others, while also providing a kind of empathic1 approximation  of the experience of others in our midst, which can (and should) inform  our responsive interactions with them. In this discussion, a broad range of  disciplines are brought together through the notion of attentiveness and  contribute to its development into practical applications, such as a kind  of interspecies etiquette. overcoming the “Problem” of embodiment For some time now, feminists have identified a “crisis of reason” in  Western environmental philosophy, which exerts powerful and dangerous  forms of denial, such as a denial of human animality and of ecological em- beddedness (Plumwood 2000), which have, in the most extreme cases, re- sulted in catastrophic environmental degradation, mass species extinction,  and violently abusive treatments of animals. The rational, disembodied  human subject has become the centre, and gold standard, of knowing and  of moral judgment, which is the basis of a human-centred, or anthropo- centric, ethic. In typically rationalist approaches to animal ethics, ethical  considerations are then incrementally extended out from this established  human moral core to grant moral status to “others,” usually based upon  a principle of similarity or sameness. Environmental philosopher, Tom  Regan, for example, argues for an extension of moral rights to animals  who fit certain criteria, such as those who have “desires and beliefs, who  perceive, remember, and can act intentionally” (2008, 18), insisting that  they be considered “subjects-of-a-life” and be granted status as “moral pa- tients.” Regan differentiates “moral patients” from “moral agents,” in that  they “cannot do what is right or wrong.... but moral patients can be on  the receiving end of the right or wrong acts of moral agents” (2003, 18).   His criteria are based upon highly valued human qualities and ca- pacities. Regan’s unacknowledged yet fundamental assumption, then, is  that these same qualities are what make humans unquestionably moral  agents who deserve moral rights—so, the only way for an animal to be  trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 103 </page> <page sequence="4"> “granted” moral status is to be similar to humans in these specific ways.  Rather than challenging the value hierarchy which places humans as mor- ally superior to animals, in that animals can only be given moral consid- eration if they are shown to be human-like, this dualistic logic reinforces  the basis of anthropocentrism, reasoning through what Plumwood calls  an “assimilationist framework” (2002, 167). However, the main problem  of “hyper-rationalism” in Western philosophy, as ecofeminist Josephine  Donovan sees it, is a contemptuous and deliberate denial of the body in  ethical decision-making and in the production of knowledge (1996, 2003,  2006). According to Elizabeth Grosz, the “inability of Western knowl- edges to conceive their own processes of (material) production, processes  that simultaneously rely on and disavow the role of the body,” is a di- rect “consequence of the historical privileging of the purely conceptual or  mental over the corporeal” (1993, 187). This patriarchal legacy of valuing  a masculinized, pure, detached reason over what have been constructed as  “feminized” embodied modes of knowing, such as emotion, has fostered a  diminution of situated and relational knowledge-making.  Recognizing and revaluing this process of knowledge-making has  long been a project of feminist epistemologies and philosophy (Donovan  2006, 306). This involves acknowledging that a capacity for emotion and  an ability to engage in feminist epistemologies is not exclusive to women.  What are termed “feminist epistemologies” have developed in Western  feminist thought, however, as a response to the dominantly masculinized  paradigm of Western knowledge-making, from which women have his- torically been excluded (Alaimo 2000, 155). Consequently, Western  environmental ethics and animal ethics have also rejected emotion as epis- temologically valid in moral deliberation (Donovan 1996, 2003, 2006). In  response, ecofeminists, such as Donovan, have drawn upon the work of  Carol Gilligan, a pioneer of feminist ethics, to describe an ethics of care2 in  which compassion and relationships are central (Gilligan 1982). Donovan  explains that, unlike traditional Western rationalist approaches to a moral  dilemma, feminist animal care theory promotes a “narrative, contextually  aware form of reasoning as opposed to the rigid rationalist abstractions of  the “one-size-fits-all” rights and utilitarian approach, emphasizing instead  that we heed the individual particularities of any given care and acknowl- edge the qualitative heterogeneity of life-forms” (2006, 306). Consistent  with feminist theory, Donovan reminds us that a feminist animal care eth- 104 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="5"> ics must always take into consideration the larger political context within  which moral deliberation arises (2006, 311). These elements are indeed  exemplary of feminism’s general insistence upon an acknowledgement of  non-ranked differences and an honoring of first-person narratives which  situate diverse individual voices and experiences, while allowing for alli- ances based upon common beliefs (Plumwood 1993, Warren 1998, Gaard  1991). Concomitantly, emphasis on the situated embodiment of individu- als is integral to feminist ethics and epistemologies (Harding 1993, Hara- way 1991, Code 1987, 1991), as is a practice of attentiveness (Donovan  1996, Warren 1998, Plumwood 2002). attentive consideration: toWard embodied ethics in  Practice As such, compelling intersections with feminist environmental ethics  and epistemologies are found in Tom Birch’s work involving “attentive  consideration” (1993). Likewise, in his article titled “Universal Considera- tion,” Birch presents an approach that differs significantly from Western  rationalist approaches to environmental ethics (1993). Breaking it down  to three main points, Birch: 1) rejects the use of, and need for, criteria  for moral consideration; 2) proposes attentiveness and openness to oth- ers as a necessary practice in environmental ethics; and, 3) asserts the  contextual and relational nature of ethical obligation (or practical neces- sity) (1993). Birch believes that the presupposition that humans can and  should attempt to define criteria for the moral consideration of the more- than-human world is not only misguided, but, in effect, “imperial power  mongering” because it is based upon the assumption that domination can  be legitimate (1993, 381). He states:  ....moral considerability is one of the credentials for membership in  the elite club of those humans and nonhumans, like national parks,  who are to benefit from the ultimately violent suppression and exploi- tation of the rest, of the Others (i.e., the objects that are taken as fit  for domination and control). (1993, 381) Rejecting what he sees as systemic oppression in Western rationalist  environmental ethics, Birch is left with the conclusion that moral consid- eration must be given to anyone and everyone up front and proposes that  humans adopt a perspective of “universal consideration” (1993).3 Thus,  by eliminating the need for criteria of inclusion (or exclusion), every entity  trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 105 </page> <page sequence="6"> becomes a potential subject of moral consideration. Birch then redefines  ‘consideration’ as “thoughtful, reflective, meditative attentiveness” and  so describes a practice of “attentive consideration” that humans should  engage in when making an ethical decision (1993, 384). Attentive con- sideration then becomes a basis upon which to determine the “practical  necessity” that is demanded by each specific occasion of moral conflict,  particularly when conflict arises between humans and other animals  (Birch 1993, 384).  It is important to stress that to give this kind of ethical consideration  to any subject or situation does not assume that it already has positive  value. It means that “giving attentive consideration should involve an ini- tial generosity of spirit [italics added] toward all others in terms of their  value potential, the possibility that they might have positive value of the  usual sort” even though “the obligation, or practical necessity, may turn  out to be to destroy the item considered, or to despise it, or to give it nega- tive value” (Birch 1993, 385). For example, Birch states that the “need to  eradicate AIDS, or perhaps a killer grizzly bear, does not, however, pre- clude, and actually requires, respecting them” (1993, 385). In his discus- sion of practical necessity, Birch refers to an ethics of duties, explaining  that “deontic experience is the experience, in response to something or  someone, that one must do something, that one is called upon to do some- thing” (1993, 382). Generally, in deontic experience, duty is prior to value  (Lacey 1986, 67). Unlike Kantian deontological ethics however, in which  humans can only have duties to other humans, Birch’s “deontic experience  can be generated out of a relationship with any kind of entity: persons,  things, systems, ecosystems, other sorts of abstractions, even numbers,”  (1993, 383). Also in contrast with traditional Kantian ethics, Birch em- phasizes the contextual and relational nature of deontic experience, stress- ing that moral obligation (practical necessity) arises in response to “each  particular entity, being or person, and at particular times and in specific  places” (1993, 384). Here again, we see strong resonances between Birch’s  ethical praxis and the feminist care ethics described earlier by Donovan. attentiveness and nonverbal communication However, Donovan’s application of attentiveness diverges sharply  when she links it to sympathetic response (1996). Building her case for  animal rights, she insists that the human capacity to sympathize with ani- 106 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="7"> mal suffering and pain is what should move humans to grant moral status  to those animals. However, she then, ironically, employs a similar exten- tionist strategy as Regan to grant moral status to animals based upon  their similarity to humans, stating that:  ...if one sees the other as a creature who suffers in a manner like one- self, then one can imagine oneself in that creature’s situation and can  thus imaginatively experience his pain. One thereby implicitly grants  him moral status comparable to one’s own. (2006, 315) Donovan’s statement reveals several problematic assumptions. One  assumption, also underlying rationalist ethics, is that humans already have  the right to “grant” moral status to others, which implies that humans  have both the ability and authority to pre-judge who counts morally and  who does not. Another, more complicated, and I would add contentious,  assumption is that humans can experience and know how other individ- ual animals feel. Problematically, Donovan asserts that the body language  of nearly all animals, including humans is “homologous,” and therefore  humans can understand nonverbal animal communication (2006, 315).  Here I tread very carefully with my discussion of Donovan’s provoca- tive claims, because while I disagree for significant reasons, I appreciate the  direction she takes by focusing on contextual situations between humans  and animals and the need to pay careful attention to animals as communi- cative beings. I find aspects of Donovan’s (2006) proposal for a dialogical  approach to feminist care ethics inspiring and particularly her argument  in favor of an alternative epistemology which includes embodied, emo- tional modes of knowing as being vital to moral deliberation. However,  other key theoretical points are in almost direct opposition to my own.  While I concur that it is important to attend to the actions and nonver- bal communication of animals, I do not think humans can thereby know  what animals are ‘saying,’ per se, or how they actually feel. And, while I  do think there are corporeal grounds for interacting with animals in ways  that enable us to understand each other to a certain, limited degree, I am  not comfortable with calling our embodiments “homologous” and assum- ing that it gives us access to the emotional experience of other animals.  For example, Donovan states that “in the case of snakes and spiders...we  can see by their body language (which is homologous to ours) that they  experience terror and anxiety, that they shrink away from sources of pain,  trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 107 </page> <page sequence="8"> that they want to live” (2006, 315). I do agree that the body language and  actions of the snakes and spiders, say fleeing from an approaching human,  while not homologous, can still indicate that what is happening is mean- ingful to them in some way, and that it expresses an avoidance of that  human. However, I do not think I can assume that I know how they actu- ally feel in the situation, or that I can know that simply by their actions  they are avoiding pain and “want to live.” The latter assumptions would  result from my interpretation of their actions based upon my reflections  on human emotions and experiences, and on my imagination of what  such actions and gestures could mean if I performed them myself.  It is crucial to the development of Western animal ethics to find a fine  balance in our understandings of continuity and difference across spe- cies (Aaltola 2002). Plumwood negotiates tensions between continuity,  or similarities across species, and difference, or radical otherness, with  her notion of intentionality (1993, 134). Celebrating a radical diversity of  “mindlike qualities,” Plumwood proposes that “intentionality provides a  way to realize continuity without assimilation, to represent the stagger- ing and exuberant complexity and heterogeneity of nature” (1993, 134),  while at the same time accommodating “an overall ground of continuity,  and a way to reject any absolute, cosmic division or break between the  human and natural spheres based on the possession of mind” (1993, 134).  Indeed, as I will show later through examples of practical phenomenol- ogy, embodiment itself provides a basic dimension of continuity through  which embodied attentiveness can be engaged to reveal significant differ- ences and individual uniqueness. Sameness and homology are not neces- sary conditions; rather they are in need of contestation. Even Donovan wavers somewhat on her assertion of homology when  she both agrees and disagrees with Thomas Nagel (1974). On the one  hand, she admits that humans probably cannot know what it is like for a  bat to be a bat, because she thinks humans are “limited by our mental ap- paratus” (Donovan 2006, 321). On the other hand, Donovan argues that  “more effort can be made to decipher animal communications and that  while we may never fully understand what it feels like to be a bat, we can  understand certain pertinent basics [italics added] of his or her experience,  sufficient for the formulation of an ethical response” (2006, 321). Regard- ing her first point, as I argue elsewhere4, limitations to human understand- ing may have more to do with differences across species and individuals  in phenomenological, sensory experience more broadly defined, and with  108 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="9"> the relative limitations of human perception compared with the physiol- ogy and abilities of other animals, than with human “mental apparatus.”  Regarding her second point, I think she is quite right that humans can,  with careful attention, understand some basic qualities of gestures and  behaviors to the extent that attentiveness to nonverbal communication  can inform an ethical response, particularly in moments of direct human- animal interactions. For support, and to illustrate this embodied potential,  I turn to scholars of practical phenomenology. Practical Phenomenology for human-animal  interactions Bodies, however physically and physiologically different, can be  grounds for nonverbal communication and for interpreting behavior  through attending to the embodied movements of others. Cultural an- thropologist Thomas Csordas purposefully adopts such a practice in his  research on charismatic healing in Catholic and Navajo rituals, describing  it as an engagement in “somatic modes of attention” (1993). Csordas’  term refers deliberately to multiple modes of sensory engagement rather  than just visual attention, which is predominant in methods of observa- tion. It also means that one engages their own body not only as a way of  sensing the embodiments of others but as a way of grasping the meaning  expressed in those embodiments. Attentiveness to one’s own body in the  process of attending to others, Csordas states, “allows us more imme- diately to grasp or recognize a set of socially salient bodily dispositions  of posture, bearing, and physique” (1999, 148). Similarly, psychologist  Kenneth Shapiro has devised an “empirical phenomenological method”  of “kinesthetic empathy,” but it differs significantly because it is specifi- cally developed to be exercised between beings of different species (1997,  294).5 He describes the method as “an investigatory posture of bodily sen- sibility adopted to promote empathic access to the meaning implicit in an  animal’s postures, gestures, and behavior” (Shapiro 1997, 292). Shapiro  developed and used this method in phenomenological studies of his dog,  Sabaka. He asserts that this method has uses and application beyond just  himself and Sabaka, explaining that there is a visceral basis for his ability  to empathize with Sabaka and that it is one that all embodied beings share  to some extent. Because of this, ...we have the capacity to approximate the shape of another being’s  experience, including that of other species. When we critically apply  trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 109 </page> <page sequence="10"> this empathic ability, the product is not anthropomorphic error. We  do not project our own shape, although we can. Rather, as we have  described under the rubric of kinesthetic empathy, we can assume the  shape of another being’s experience and thereby gain an understand- ing of that experience. (Shapiro 1997, 294) Shapiro’s phenomenological method starts from a standpoint that  respects and seeks to engage the individual subjectivity of other-than- human animals (1997, 295). Most importantly, Shapiro’s empirical phe- nomenological method offers an irruption of embodiment and empathy as  a verb, as active. Consequently, Shapiro’s method converges with Csordas’  cultural phenomenology, which is a method of inquiry “concerned with  synthesizing the immediacy of embodied experience with the multiplicity  of cultural meaning in which we are always and inevitably immersed”  (Csordas 1999, 143). Both methods involve somatic modes of attention  for attending with the body as a situated researcher and attending to the  bodies of humans and other animals.  There are important qualities of intentionality and intersubjectivity  to this kind of attentiveness. Attending with one’s body goes far beyond  just looking toward or gazing at; it means turning a full bodily engage- ment toward others, it means that our very own bodies can actually tell  us something about others and about the world if we are attentive to it  and them (Csordas 1993, 138–39). Taking up an uncannily similar per- spective on embodiment, in yet another disciplinary field, philosopher  and practical phenomenologist Elizabeth Behnke has explored “interki- naesthetic comportment,” the ongoing adjustments of postures, gestures,  actions made in relation to others, in human-human and human-animal  interactions (1997). Like Csordas and Shapiro, beyond the immediate in- terplay between two beings, she is also interested in how external factors,  both social and physical, further influence these situated exchanges. The  contention is that in particular places and social situations, we tend to  adopt certain patterns of movement and habits of posture and gesture,  some of which may, over time and through repetition, become sedimented  into a repertoire of micromovements that Behnke calls “ghost gestures.”  She finds the “tacit choreography of everyday life” and “micromovements  witness to our sociality insofar as they are not only socially shaped, but  perpetuate certain styles of intercorporeal interaction and sustain certain  modes of responsivity” (Behnke 1997, 181). There is a tendency to em- 110 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="11"> body, in the form of recognizable postures and gestures, certain social and  cultural expectations. Behnke gives the example of a child who, when re- peatedly urged to concentrate harder on her homework, merely displayed  “a kinaesthetic pattern that is visibly expressive of ‘trying’”—that is, she  “hunched over her work, frowning and staring at the page, clenching her  teeth and gripping her pencil tightly” (Behnke 1997, 190). Kinaesthetic patterns, Behnke suggests, can become sedimented in our  bodies, but not in a rigidly fixed sense, rather as a repertoire of interki- naesthic comportments. Ghost gestures related to controlling the body,  like “bracing” and “holding back,” are likely some of the most commonly  shared (Behnke 1997, 192). Many people will be able to identify with  holding back “in, for instance, an educational system that expects people  to sit still and shut up, producing a “schooled body”” (Behnke 1997, 192).  Past and present commingle in our embodied responses to situations. As  Behnke reminds us, embodiments of ghost gestures are not merely hango- vers from past experiences, “but may be an all too appropriate response to  networks of power relations operating here and now” (1997, 193). Simi- larly, ghost gestures are not “merely the manifestation of individual “psy- chological problems” that have been “somatized” in “holding patterns.”  Rather, they may be clues to the way(s) bodies and bodily movements in  general are ongoingly shaped in a particular social milieu” (Behnke 1997,  193). For these reasons, Behnke reminds us that careful attention must  be brought to “ghost gestures,” to our own involuntary, interkinaesthetic  comportments. She warns that we tend to embody ghost gestures and a  “toxic intercorporeity” (Behnke 1997, 196) which, if left unattended to,  can be particularly counterproductive to interspecies interactions, which  depend entirely on nonverbal communication and body language. She ex- plains that toxic intercorporeity often takes the forms of “bracing and  numbing oneself and then ‘vacating the area’” (Behnke 1997, 195).  Fortunately, Behnke offers a method for becoming aware of and ne- gotiating ghost gestures from within (1997, 195), and even proposes a  way for transformative embodiments by actively re-inhabiting them and  then consciously altering the pattern (Behnke 1997, 198). She provides a  compelling example, which Behnke herself has exercised, in her “interspe- cies practice of peace” (1999). Ultimately, Behnke (1997) constructively  suggests that her method of phenomenological investigation “can be a  kind of “action research” that not only calls us to ethical self-responsibil- trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 111 </page> <page sequence="12"> ity, but can eventually lead to the development of an embodied ethics,  in both theory and practice” (198). In practice, such an embodied ethics  would strive to avoid what Behnke refers to as a contagion of toxic in- tercorporeity: “for example, if one walks into a room full of tense, angry,  frustrated, or anxious people, one may well find—if one has the appro- priate sensibility to discern it—that one’s own ambient bodily tonus has  also increased” (1997, 196). Imagine, then, if a researcher embodies a  toxic intercorporeity, how might it affect the research subjects and the  whole relational space? According to a rationalist method of research,  particularly in many forms of animal studies, investigators are meant to  uninhabit their own bodies and actively refrain from intercorporeity of  any sort, in an attempt to be neutral and detached observers. Research- ers are schooled to adopt these postures in their scientific training which  eventually become routine and involuntary ghost gestures in their prac- tices. It begs the question of how these micromovements of vacancy and  numbness or freezing of bodies might affect the research space, and thus  the results?  In reality, actual disembodiment is not possible. Feminists know this  rationalist practice to be the “illusion of unobtrusive intrusion” (Desmond  1999, 191), and feminist epistemologies reclaim the role of embodiment  in situated research. Acknowledging embodiment as Behnke does, then,  corresponds nicely with methods for a feminist, ethics-based epistemol- ogy. The project remains however, for working out how to inhabit bodies  in ethically appropriate ways for interspecies research, as well as in eve- ryday social interactions. It leads Behnke to ask: “What, for instance, are  the interkinaesthetics of genuine mutual responsivity?.... And what sorts  of practices swing into play and reinforce the style of bodily micromove- ments that further healthy intercorporeity?” (1997, 196). Fortunately,  these questions find the generative beginnings of answers in Cheney and  Weston’s ethics-based epistemology (1999). attentiveness and invitation: toWard intersPecies  etiquette In their development of an environmental etiquette and ethics-based  epistemology, Cheney and Weston were strongly inspired by the praxis of  attentiveness and generosity of spirit underlying Birch’s universal consid- eration (1999, 265). Like Birch, Cheney and Weston’s approach is also  112 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="13"> sharply distinct from traditional Western philosophy and rationalist moral  considerations of animals. They explain that, ...on the usual view...we must first know what animals are capable  of, then decide on that basis whether and how we are to consider  them ethically. On the alternative view, we will have no idea of what  other animals are actually capable – we will not readily understand  them – until we already have approached them ethically – that is,  until we have offered them the space and time, the occasion, and the  acknowledgement necessary to enter into relationship. Ethics must  come first. (Cheney and Weston 1999, 118) Cheney and Weston highlight four problematic assumptions foun- dational to traditional Western environmental ethics. They are that: a)  “ethical action is a response to our knowledge of the world” (1999, 116);  b) “the world is readily knowable” (1999, 116); c) changes in ethical  theory only occur through marginal extensions of the established cen- tral models (1999, 117); and, d) “the task of ethics is to sort the world  ethically” (1999, 117). As Weston further points out, the third assump- tion is distinctly evident in a “Singerian moral extensionism” (2004, 28),  which remains stuck in the realm of “concentrisms,” which are ultimately  bound to a human-centred moral core (2004, 27). By contrast, Weston  and Cheney present alternative assumptions that insist upon an approach  of open wonder and respect for mystery, and an acceptance that some  things may be unknowable and that others can come to be known only if  they are first approached ethically (1999, 118).  Furthermore, they propose that human and other animal beings are  best approached through a process of “practical etiquette” in which “the  task is to create the space within which a response can emerge or an  exchange coevolve” (1999, 126). Such etiquette could be expressed in  an enactment of bodily invitation (Cheney and Weston 1999). For, “if  our very mode of approach shapes that world in turn, then ethics itself  must be a form of invitation or welcoming, sometimes of ritual invocation  and sometimes of literally creating the settings in which new possibili- ties might emerge” (Weston 2004, 32). In other words, to bear an open  “invitation” in this way is to embody a kind of non-anthropocentric, or  posthumanist, ethics. Intent and attitude can be communicated through  the body and cannot be easily masked. An example of the telltale nature  of bearing is found in Vicki Hearne’s account of observing people in a  trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 113 </page> <page sequence="14"> chimpanzee laboratory (Cheney and Weston 1999, 127). She readily dis- tinguishes between three types of demeanor belonging to three particular  types of people: animal trainers and handlers, Hollywood types, and aca- demics. To her surprise, Hearne finds that she can discern each of them  from a distance, just by the way they hold themselves as they approach  and move through the compound: the handlers and trainers move with an  acute awareness and receptiveness of the animals that surrounded them,  the Hollywood types move with complete indifference and the academics  with an air of distanced observation that is nonetheless intrusive (Cheney  and Weston 1999, 128).  In the way humans approach other animals, Plumwood also ponders  “is it to be a posture of openness, of welcoming, of invitation, towards  earth others, or is it to be a stance of prejudged superiority, of deafness,  of closure” (2002, 175–76). As with Cheney and Weston’s etiquette of in- vitation, a comportment of openness is also a key element of Plumwood’s  ethical praxis. Indeed, Plumwood has long promoted embodiments of “in- tentional stance” in animal-human encounters (1993, 137). Plumwood  explains: “we can encounter the earth other as a potential intentional  subject, as one who can alter us as well as we it, and thus can begin to  conceive a potential for a mutual and sustaining interchange with nature”  (1993, 137). Positing moral responsibility as emerging within these kinds  of interchanges between human and animal intentional subjects reveals  the specific and situational qualities of ethical moments. “Thus,” in Plum- wood’s words, “the intentional stance makes possible the conception of  our relationships to earth others in ethical and political terms, where ethics  is defined as the domain of response to the other’s needs, ends, directions,  or meaning” (1993, 138). This ethics is highly contextual and specific.  To illustrate, Plumwood poses two scenarios in which a potential con- flict arises between a human and a) a poisonous snake or b) a difficult  human stranger, who has taken up residence on the veranda (2002, 170).  In some cases, the original human occupant may have some reason to  accommodate either of the two strangers. Perhaps, as Plumwood (2002)  suggests, they may be accommodating if they “have some responsibility  for their homelessness, or it is an emergency and temporary situation, a  flood, for example” (170–71). However, in other cases, the original human  occupant may reason that if the situation poses danger or is likely to re- sult in conflict, it may be appropriate to encourage the stranger, snake or  114 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="15"> human, to move on. But Plumwood is careful to clarify that there are fur- ther considerations inherent in this potential course of action, such that: ...different methods of encouragement and different levels of respon- sibility for finding other accommodation may apply, depending on  the context. But in neither case, as a matter of justice, are you entitled  to initiate unnecessary and disproportionate violence, shooting the  snake, or the difficult human, for example, just on the grounds that  they may become a problem, and without trying less punitive solu- tions. (2002, 171) Plumwood’s hypothetical scenario exemplifies many key contours of  feminist, posthumanist environmental ethics. Reasoning through a nar- rative situation involves detailed consideration of a highly specific con- text in which varying degrees of responsibility may arise through the  snake-human and human-human relationships. There can be no prior as- sumptions of moral value according to dualistic ontology to provide a  one-size-fits-all solution. Plumwood argues, in her recent book, Environ- mental Culture, for a “dialogical interspecies ethic” in which the role of  nonverbal communication between beings is fundamental to the genera- tion of knowledge leading to an ethical relationship (2002, 189). Such an  ethic fundamentally involves “reconstructing human identity in ways that  acknowledge our animality, decentre rationality and abandon exclusion- ary concepts of rationality” (Plumwood 2002, 194). Furthermore, it re- quires an “openness to the non-human other as potentially an intentional  and communicative being” and an “active invitation to communicative  interaction” (Plumwood 2002, 194). Plumwood asserts that when the category and identity of ‘rational  human’ is no longer ranked as superior to all other experiences of being,  there is then potential for humans to encounter and approach animals  as intentional and communicable beings (2002, 194). With rationalist  and humanist assumptions so disrupted, communication is no longer re- stricted to a verbal exchange between humans, and can be redefined as a  greater range of nonverbal, embodied expressiveness (Plumwood 2002,  192). Moreover, this ethic and its intentional stance enable a recognition  of animal agency and communication, which “is in turn central to any  kind of negotiation or mutual adjustment process” (Plumwood 2002,  178). For instance, Plumwood recounts an actual scenario in which a ven- omous tiger snake appeared repeatedly to bask in the sun on her veranda.  trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 115 </page> <page sequence="16"> In response, Plumwood was “able to convey [her] own counter claims to  the space effectively by throwing some sandshoes to land within a foot or  so of the sleepy reptile, who slithered off promptly and never returned”  (Plumwood 2002, 178). Her example reinforces that the process of em- bodying a practical environmental etiquette in getting to know an animal  other requires a more conscious embrace and enactment of an ethical  position, one that strives to be approachable and receptive to animal oth- ers. Simply encountering other beings without an immediate awareness of  comportment may do little to enable meaningful and informative interac- tion. As Weston explains, performing etiquette ...requires us to move with caution, attentiveness, circumspection.  Ethics is no longer constituted by a merely abstract respect, but de- mands something far more embodied: a willingness and ability to  make the space, not just conceptually, but in one’s own person [ital- ics added] and in the design and structure of personal and human  spaces, for the emergence of more-than-human others into relation- ship. (2004, 31) With this quote, Weston further draws attention to the visceral and  active qualities of etiquette, to how we gesture and move our bodies in  relation to others. It is not enough for one to simply adopt an attitude of  politeness or to merely engage in abstract considerations. To these ends,  Elizabeth Behnke provides a cogent example in her “interspecies practice  of peace” (1999). a Practice of Peace and the Possibilities beyond As a practicing phenomenologist, Behnke (1999) has developed a form  of interkinasethetic comportment which shares many qualities with Plum- wood’s intentional stance and Cheney and Weston’s etiquette, as well as  with Csordas’ somatic modes of attention and Shapiro’s kinesthetic empa- thy. She created it in relation with two cats, Jo Jo and B.C. (Bad Cat), who  often came into confrontation with each other (Behnke 1999, 102). It was  not intentional at first, but after repeatedly rushing out to intervene in a  situation that she anticipated would result in a cat fight, Behnke realized  that her fear and tension were contributing to an already tense situation in  the way toxic ghost gestures can be intercorporeally contagious. She then  purposefully uninhabited embodiments of tension, fear and anticipation of  the fight and instead cultivated a calm and calming way of bodily being.  116 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 15(1) 2010 </page> <page sequence="17"> She describes her practice of peace as a process of: “letting my weight  settle; experientially “inhabiting” the kinaesthesia of my own gaze; open- ing my heart; and not-knowing what is going to happen next” (1999,  102). This series of embodiments enabled her to uninhabit threatening  postures and gestures. For example, letting her weight settle reconfigured  her initial posture of readiness for a fight, like being ready to pounce on  the cats to break things up, and by softening her gaze, she no longer stared  pointedly at each of the cats. Behnke found that inhabiting these noncon- frontational postures and micromovements indeed helped to diffuse the  situation, and at the very least, did not serve to escalate the aggressive tone  within the interkinaesthetic field (1999, 105). Behnke’s phenomenological practice holds much promise for etiquette  in interspecies encounters, but it is important to recognize that her inter- actions took place in a relatively unrestricted, relational environment. The  context in which one might engage in something like Behnke’s practice of  peace matters greatly and may dramatically affect the process. As Ralph  Acampora asserts, ideally, encounters should take place between free-liv- ing animals and humans, in “that “living room” which permits genuine  confrontation complete with all its motile possibilities of adversity, avoid- ance, and free association” (1999, 127). Also interested in what phenom- enological insights and practices have to offer to posthumanist, ethical  human-animal relationships, Acampora is working “toward a somatology  of cross-species community” (1999). Like Behnke, he is optimistic that  “live bodiment can function as a conduit for interspecific conviviality”  (1999, 122). Along these lines, Behnke ponders the potential applications  of her practices of bodily awareness and conscious embodiments of peace  and openness, such as a “readiness for improvisation” (1999, 107) for  encounters with free-living animals in the wild (1999, 111). Ultimately, we have seen how a praxis of attentiveness inspires many  practical applications of ethical interactions between species. We are en- couraged to ponder what the further possibilities might be for animal  studies and animal ethics, and for animal research which could employ  dramatically different and less obtrusive approaches and technologies.  There is so much potential for new developments of interspecies eti- quette in fieldwork, which could engage in an ethics-based epistemology  (Cheney &amp; Weston, 1999), and recognize research as truly “collabora- tive ventures” (Plumwood 2002, 195) between humans and animals. Col- trAci wArkEntin INTERSpECIES ETIquETTE 117 </page> <page sequence="18"> laboration is possible, and likely even unavoidable to a certain extent.  Attentiveness to the reciprocal influences of social interactions further  recognizes the agency of the animals involved. Respect for that agency  must also be embodied and given “up front” as an ethical stance. Just as  by Cheney and Weston’s (1999) ethics-based epistemological model one  would ‘get to know’ other animals as independent subjects, without using  coercion, and would , ideally, opt to engage in voluntary participatory  encounters rather than forcing them  into a human realm, literally and  figuratively, for interaction and observation. One would, at the very least,  attempt to meet animals half way. This is the crux of the embodied inter- species etiquette illustrated by Jim Nollman when he invites wild orcas to  jam with him: “using musical media which all cetaceans seem to prefer,  paddling out to them in his floating rhythm section, thus in a way that  allows them to decline the encounter entirely or to break it off whenever  they wish” (Cheney and Weston 1999, 129).  In sum, the bodily enactments of openness and responsivity in inter- species interactions matters as much as where and how the meeting takes  place. As Behnke reflects, her practice of peace does not function to sud- denly unify atomistic bodies, rather, it works because beings are “always  already interkinaesthetically linked, and what the practice [she is] describ- ing does is to lift this connectivity from blind anonymity to lucidly lived  awareness” (1999, 109). Such an awareness of one’s active embodiment  corresponds with ethics as a conscious way of being in the world. As Mar- got Lyon and Jack Barbalet assert, “the body is intercommunicative and  active. In a significant social sense the body referred to here is not simply  the body we have but the body we are” (1994, 56, italics added). All of  the interdisciplinary contours touched upon in this paper, then, mingle  to form an interspecies etiquette through ethical ways of being and of  approaching others. These require the cultivation of a keen awareness of  embodiment, our own and the bodiments of other animals, to grasp conti- nuities and negotiate key differences. On the way to interspecies etiquette,  then, a praxis of attentiveness is a promising start.  acknoWledgments This paper has benefited from the intellectual generosity of many  peers, mentors and colleagues.

The terms “empathy” and “sympathy” enjoy much contestation, so it is impor- tant here to provide my working definitions as they are used in this essay. When  I use the term “empathy” I am referring to a capacity engaged in an exercise of  imaginative embodiment in which one strives to approximate the experience of  another being through a keen attentiveness to their gestures and actions, aided  by an understanding of their sensory capacities. It does not involve a projection  of emotion onto the other, nor does it mean that one can know exactly how or  what the other is actually feeling, which tends to be implied by “sympathy.”  2. Responsive to constructive critiques that care theory could “reinforce certain  assumptions about women and [their] care giving role in Western patriarchal  culture” (Adams 1996, 171), ecofeminists Carol Adams (1996) and Donovan  (2006) point out that practices of care and capacities for compassion are not,  and should not be, gender-specific, and that they need to be reclaimed as such  rather than rejected because they have been dominantly feminized.   3. John Livingston’s environmental work has interesting convergences and di- vergences with Birch’s. While they follow similar paths through the quag- mire of Western environmental philosophy, Birch (1993) ends up with ethics  as “universal consideration,” and Livingston (1994) ends up with ethics as  “prosthetic devices.”   4. Please see (Warkentin 2007).  5. Interestingly, Donovan (1996) also takes up the work of Kenneth Shapiro  (1990) to explore the possibilities of attentiveness and interspecies under- standing in her discussion of sympathy.  references Aaltola, Elisa. 2002. ‘Other animal ethics’ and the demand for difference.
