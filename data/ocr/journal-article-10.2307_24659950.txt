Congres europeen des Etudes juives (Patrimoines Juda'isme), Les Edi tions du Cerf, Paris 1993, vii and 833 pp., large paperback FFr 400, —. ISBN 2-204-04858-5. ISSN 0762-0829. This voluminous book contains the addresses and lectures delivered at the IVth Congress of the European Association of Jewish Studies held at Troyes from 6-13 July 1990 in commemoration of the 950th anniversary of Rashi's birth in this French town. The publication is dedicated to the late Professor E.E. Urbach who devoted most of his work to the teachings of the Rabbis in medieval France. Although the bulk of the papers col lected in the volume deals with Rashi, medieval and more recent Judaism, the book includes also a number of articles which pertain to the field covered by JSJ. They are dealt with more closely in the following lines. In general, the various contributions to the volume are of a high standard. In the section "Litterature de la periode greco-romaine. La Septante" (pp. 69-210) the following papers are to be found: 71-79 U. Rappaport, The Hellenistic World As Seen by the Book of Daniel (For the authors of the Book of Daniel Alexander's conquest is a schism in history, with which a new era begun, which by its wickedness is completely different from all that preceded); 81-90 F. Garcia Martinez, Le IVe Esdras et les mss de Qumrän (The author treats a number of formal features and leading ideas which 4 Ezra has more or less in common with some Qumran scrolls. Although 4 Ezra was written under the impression of the fall of Jerusalem and its temple, the ideas found in the book are reaching back to earlier Journal for the Study of Judaism, XXIV, 2, © E. J. Brill, Leiden</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW OF BOOKS 325 times); 91-103 Ph.R. Da vies, Halakhah in the Qumran Scrolls (A noteworthy and challenging article in which the author suggests that the term "halakhah" is applicable to the legal materials of CD, not to 1QS. The laws of CD are presented as being specifications of the law of Moses. The rules of behaviour for community members in 1QS are not derived from Scripture and do not claim to be); 105-112 L. Poznansky, Delenda est Hierosolyma (Edifying reflections on the religious significance of Jerusalem); 113-119 G. Vermes, Josephus on Daniel (Cf. also JJS 4:2 (1992), 149-166. Josephus' treatment of the Book of Daniel throws light on the elastic state of its Greek text, brings home the antiquity of exegetical tradi tions surviving in the later Jewish compositions, and gives an insight into the way Josephus worked, thought and produced his biblical history); 121-137 M. del Verme, Les dimes hebraiques dans l'oeuvre de Josephe et dans le Nouveau Testament (Treatment of certain problems inherent in the praxis and halakha of tithing as evidenced by Josephus and the New Testament); 139-163 Jacqueline Genot-Bismuth, De I'alliance de Damas au More Zedeq: Analyse de la genese d'un prophetisme generateur de schisme (The expression more zedeq derives from Hosea 10:12 and is the opposite of more seqer of Isaiah 9:14 and Habakkuk 2:18. It implies the institutional functions of the legitimate highpriesthood: "docteur de la Loi" and "censeur des moeurs". Inspired by the Scriptures, the more zedeq of CD opposed the sanhedrin of which he himself was a member. He was left with no other choice than to make a complete break with it. The article is no easy reading); 165-171 A. Oppenheimer, The Boundaries of Eretz-Israel as Inter preted by the Sages (Various norms influenced the way in which the territory of Eretz-Israel was determined: the halakhic standards of purity and the observance of the agricultural demands; the demographic factor, namely the boundaries of the Jewish settlement; political motives, e.g. Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's rulings whose aim it was to encourage Jews to settle in cities where the main population was gentile. In the third century C.E. the Euphrates served as the eastern border of greater Eretz-Israel to enable also less well-to-do Jews in Babylonia to bury their dead in Eretz Israel); 173-182 Monika Pesty, La Septante et sa lecture patristique: un exemple (Jeremie 3, 22 - 4, 1); 183-201 Marguerite Harl, Le grand cantique de Mo'ise en Deuteronome 32: Quelques traits originaux de la version grecque des Septante·, 203 210 N. de Lange, The Jews of Byzantium and the Greek Bible.
