The site was named Bonampak, a Maya term meaning painted walls . Maya us evocative architecture, think civilization of phrase many engineer- -this evocative phrase makes us think of many things: architecture, engineer- ing, astronomy, mathematics, hiero- glyphic writing, the fine arts and a host of intellectual endeavors. But in all likelihood we do not think about Maya music. Yet the Maya were a musical peo- ple, as we know from Spanish chroni- cles, from frescoes and other sources. Drums, whistles, rattles, trumpets, flutes in varying shapes, pitched to different registers- all these instruments, and others, were characteristic of Maya music. Now the archaeological record has increased our understanding of Maya musical practices. From a pair of elite tombs at the site of Pacbitun, in the Cayo District of Belize, come more than a dozen instruments from the Late Classic period (A.D. 600-900). Included among the grave goods bur- ied with two aristocratic women, these instruments are a valuable ad- dition to the archaeological record, which is generally rather scanty in re- gard to Maya music. Remarkably enough, some of these instruments can still be played. The instruments found at Pacbitun include a single drum, two composite flute-maracas, a group of five flutes, and eight impressively ornate "figu- rine ocarinas - flutes that come in a variety of anthropomorphic and ani- mal shapes. The composite flute-maracas are the first such instruments ever dis- covered in a secure archaeological context. The finding of these instru- ments raises some very interesting questions about the nature of Maya music; and when we compare them with other instruments from Maya culture, we begin to see more clearly the social functions of Maya music. One of those functions, clearly, was of a funerary nature. The instruments at Pacbitun, almost beyond question, played an important role in the burial ceremonies of the women in whose graves they were found. Professional musicians probably used these instru- ments to escort the funeral cortege to the tomb of the deceased, where some of the instruments may have been broken and left behind on pur- pose. The sound they produced must have been impressively solemn. Writ- ten accounts attest to the sad, doleful quality of Maya drum music, and the flutes and the maracas -a type of decorated rattle -would have added to the melancholy character of the procession. But we also know from other sources that Maya music could be festive, and that professional musi- cians played on other public occa- sions.

In one section of these murals, a group of musicians is depicted shak- ing maracas and beating both drums and tortoise carapaces during a pro- cession; in another section, trumpet players seem to be playing some sort of fanfare. The whole cycle of Bonampak murals apparently celebrates a battle with Maya adversaries. The figures are life-sized, and the depictions nearly floor-to-ceiling. In the murals of one room, scenes of Maya fighting are depicted; captives are being ar- raigned, and some are pleading with their captors. In yet another room, Maya musi- cians are shown in the lower half of the wall space, while in the upper half, members of the elite who will play a prominent part in the cere- mony are being appareled. In every panel, the hierarchical rank of all the people depicted is per- fectly evident; it would seem that musicians occupy a rank higher than that of the common people, but one that is somewhat subordinate to the members of the elite. Music may also have been impor- tant to the actual conduct of war, not just to the celebration of victories. The chronicles offer some suggestion that Maya warriors went into battle against the Spanish blowing whistles and conch shell trumpets and beating drums and hollow tortoise shells. Whether such whistles would have been used to frighten opposing forces, to sound maneuvering signals, or to invoke the deities is not clear. Wr tles e do were know, not however, an uncommon that whis- in- tles were not an uncommon in- strument among the Maya. They appear with some frequency in house- hold contexts, where they may have served either ceremonial or non- ceremonial functions. Drums and other instruments, usually found in fragmentary condition, also occur in domestic contexts. But the record is slender enough that we do not really know yet what role music played in Maya everyday life. But why are Maya musical instru- ments so scarce? The answer lies partly in the materials they were made of. In the tropical climate of Central America, perishable materi- als do not last long, and we know that a variety of drums and long Maya trumpets were constructed of wood. The chroniclers mention not only conch shell trumpets but also bone whistles and reed flutes. These mate- rials, too, leave little archaeological trace. As it happens, the instruments from Pacbitun are all made of fired ceramic, and so yield evidence both of their use and their construction techniques. The largest and artistically most in- teresting group of instruments are the figurine ocarinas, all of which come from the second Pacbitun grave we opened. Indeed, this burial also yielded the five flutes and one of the two unique composite flute-maracas. There is considerable speculation about the function of Maya figurine ocarinas. Scholars have suggested that those instruments wrought in bird and animal forms may have been used in hunting as bird or animal calls. It has also been suggested that figurine ocarinas served as children's toys. But the association with elite January/February 1988 27</page><page sequence="5">Structure 2 at Pacbitun, the site of aristocrats' graves, is shown here before the highly successful 1986 dig. activities and burials is reinforced by finds at other sites such as Lubaantun in Belize and Jaina in Mexico, where substantial collections of figurine- ocarinas have been unearthed. The figurine-ocarinas differ signif- icantly in size as well as in design. The intact instruments range from 8.5 to 17.9 centimeters (roughly 2.5 to six inches) in height; each has two stops positioned on the backside of the figurine, and a protruding mouth- piece. Men, women, animals -all are represented in a wide variety of styles. Of special interest is a beautifully crafted figure generally known as the Fat God. This portly male figure, who is seated in a Buddha-like posture, is dressed in a headpiece resembling a turban. He wears earspools, and is holding either a drum or, possibly, a circular fan. This deity is often asso- ciated with death in the Maya pantheon. Another ocarina depicts a kneeling woman who wears elaborate Maya headgear and holds what appears to be a water lily. Mayanists have re- cently recognized the significance of the water lily in Maya iconography, and established its frequent connec- tion with the afterlife. Two other ocarinas depict male figures, modeled on quite different scales, wearing elaborate Maya head- dresses and displaying some of the elite clothing fashionable among the Maya a thousand years ago. One of these figures is kneeling and has his Royal Interments « Pacbitun promontory is situated along the on foothills a limestone of promontory along the foothills of the Maya Mountains. Given the ram- pant looting of archaeological sites in the area, the site is in surprisingly good condition; it was first brought to the attention of the Belize government only in 1971. At that time a new road was being constructed near the site, which was covered with heavy vege- tation. No research was carried out at the site until the team from Trent University began its work in 1980. Although only a sampling of the total site area has been excavated, the entire site has been thoroughly mapped. The core zone -the heart of elite Maya activities -includes three main plazas, aligned east to west and covering an area of at least 0.5 square kilometers (roughly 0.3 square miles). More than forty mounds have been recorded. They range from two to sixteen meters high, and some are as much as 70 meters long. Hundreds of smaller, presumably residential mounds and associated agricultural terraces belonging to the Maya farm- ing population have been identified on the periphery of Pacbitun, extending some three to five kilometers (two to three miles) from the center. The core area is marked by a se- ries of temple-pyramids, long, low range-type buildings commonly iden- tified as palaces, two lengthy cause- ways, and a ceremonial ballcourt. Ten stelae (free-standing monuments) and seven altars, several with partially preserved carvings, have been located. The two elite burials from which the musical instruments come were both discovered in Plaza A- the loca- tion of nearly all of the stone monu- ments, and clearly the central stage for ceremonial rites in the city. This plaza occupies the highest point on the Pacbitun acropolis, and is sym- metrically surrounded by six major mounds. The graves of the elite women were opened in the two tall- est pyramidal structures, which face each other across the plaza, and which contain many elite burials in addition to the ones that are being considered here. The excavation of both structures has now been completed; the team hit sterile bedrock during the 1987 season, three-and-a-half meters be- low the plaza surface. The evidence indicates that each structure under- went a succession of construction phases starting in the Middle Pre- classic period (ca. 500 B.C.). Pacbitun ceased to function dur- ing the Terminal Classic period (A.D. 800-900) at the same time that many other lowland Maya centers abruptly collapsed. Why this occurred was one of the many questions which the team from Trent was pursuing, and the excavating of the major civic and ceremonial structures was a result of this interest. Eleven axially placed burials were uncovered in these two structures. All of them contained the bedecked but badly decomposed bodies of Maya nobles, laid out with their heads posi- tioned to the south. Bodies were ex- tended in a supine position; and as best we could determine, granted the 28 Archaeology</page><page sequence="6">Structure 2 as it looked after the musical instruments were removed from the site, along with a rich supply of other artifacts . hands on his knees; he wears a com- bination rabbit/raptorial bird head- dress. The other, smaller figurine represents a chubby man who is standing. This latter figure wears a long cloak and a headdress. The ocarinas most exquisite is an elaborately of the figurine dressed ocarinas is an elaborately dressed Maya woman wearing a huipil, or full- length dress. At one time, this figu- rine, like most of the others from the same grave, was painted a fugitive blue (so-called because the paint wore off easily). The woman is re- gally posed; she wears a strikingly brimmed and tasseled hat that is posi- tioned stylishly atop her elongated head. Her skull appears, in fact, to have been artificially deformed, most likely during her infancy- a custom prevalent among many of the Maya of the Classic period. In any event, her hair is sharply cut in terraces and is coiffeured to accentuate the square shape of her face. She also holds a pet bird perched on her left arm. This last piece is a masterful representation, and offers us an in- triguing glimpse of the Late Classic elite who lived at Pacbitun. Such figu- rine ocarinas have also been recorded at other lowland Maya centers, most notably at the island burial site of Jaina, off the Campeche coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. The effigy figures of the Late Classic in particular often display a striking degree of realism, elegance and sophistication. They are state of preservation, the legs were all crossed. Virtually all of the burials contained impressive grave goods, and the two which yielded the musical instru- ments were no exception. The first woman was buried midway up and beneath the staircase of Structure 1, while the second woman was interred below the floor area of the final tem- ple atop Structure 2. On the basis of the ceramics, both graves can be confidently assigned to the Late Clas- sic period, and most likely to the ter- minal phase of the period. The bur- ials may have taken place within one generation, or possibly two. The first woman was twenty to forty years of age, and had been bur- ied in a specially prepared cist -or stone-lined burial chamber- 2.5 meters long and one meter wide. This woman's chest must have been totally covered by a remarkable shell neck- lace consisting of roughly 2,500 small, drilled shell beads that had been strung together. Two large manos - very smooth imported volcanic stone implements used to grind corn -had been placed at her side, and a jade bead had probably been placed in her mouth -a common Maya burial cus- tom. A large orange-polychrome dish was positioned over her knees, and an unusual slate "wrench"- probably a ceremonial mace -was found near her feet at the north end of the grave. The two musical instruments recovered from this grave also lay at the woman's feet. They consisted of the drum and one of the unique com- posite flute-maracas. The second grave was much richer in musical instruments as well as in other pottery furnishings. The cist was almost identical to the one in the first burial, but its sides were lined with limestone slabs and it was cov- ered by a series of large, irregularly shaped slate slabs. The use of slate slabs for burial roofing was a common feature of the Pacbitun elite graves. Some twenty vessels included in this grave fix the time of burial in the Tepeu 3, Terminal Classic period (A.D. 800-900). These vessels were concentrated near the feet and head of the deceased, and along the west side of the grave. A magnificently crafted brown flint bi-pointed dagger rested above the cranium along the edge of the cist. Also clustered near the head were three miniature ves- sels, a finely carved jade "portrait head" pendant, and a pair of small drilled jade beads. Again, an inverted large red dish covered the middle of the body, while the space near the feet was crowded with more than a dozen ceramic vessels, some of them stacked on top of each other. The fourteen musical instruments found in this grave were evenly divided be- tween the head and the feet. It seems apparent from such a number that the instruments served a cere- monial function; it is not very likely that even a woman who loved music would have so many different instru- ments in her personal possession. The archaeological work at Pacbi- tun has both confirmed and modified the existing record on Maya music. We now have first-hand knowledge of what particular instruments look and sound like, and we now know more certainly the role that music played in Maya funeral rites. A great deal re- mains to be learned about Maya mu- sic, and one can hope that future ex- cavations at Pacbitun and other Maya sites will increase our knowledge. □ January/February 1988 29</page><page sequence="7">The Maya musical instrument shown above served as both a flute and a maraca. The bulbous end held 15 ceramic pellets which when shaken gave offa rattling noise . To play the flute shown below, Maya musicians blew into the narrow end, playing flngerholes on the top . easily recognized as ceramic master- pieces that were never surpassed anywhere in ancient Mesoamerica. Many of the ocarinas found at Pac- bitun were badly fragmented -and may well have been deliberately shat- tered, in a ceremonial fashion, at the time of interment. Most of them were restorable to their original state, however, and the fact that they were broken gives us insight into their methods of manufacture. Sev- eral have remarkably detailed, mold- made heads and headdresses which were then tenoned into hollow, styl- ized torsos that were either hand- modeled or pressed into molds. Since no figurine molds have been recov- ered during excavations at Pacbitun, it is possible that these ocarinas were imported from elsewhere. Musically, interesting the because figurine ocarinas recent stud- are interesting because recent stud- ies suggest that frequently there is a difference between the musical registers of the male and female ex- amples. Many of these instruments can still be played; they produce a piccolo-like sound. The male-figure ocarinas are generally pitched lower than the female ones- a difference in tone that was probably deliberate. In the archaeological literature, these figurine instruments are often referred to as "whistles," but because they have more than one stop they are more properly called ocarinas. The five flutes recovered from the second Pacbitun grave also had two stops. Like the ocarinas, they could play in multiple octaves, and hence could produce music of considerable complexity. Four of the flutes are similar in size; they average 18.5 cen- timeters (roughly seven inches) in length and 1.9 centimeters (slightly less than an inch) in diameter. All of them have a circular mouthpiece, two finger-hole stops, and a small globular sounding chamber in the middle. In each one, the distal end -the end far- thest from the mouthpiece -flares out slightly and is delicately modelled into the shape of an ornate flower. These ends all bear traces of the fa- miliar blue paint. The fifth flute is shorter and, unlike the others, has traces of brilliant orange paint on its distal end. The two unique instruments uncov- ered at Pacbitun, the composite flute- maracas, are of particular interest to us. Similar in size -roughly 16 cen- timeters (about six inches) long- these pieces combine a flute at one end with a rattle at the other. Each piece is evenly divided into the rattle ball and flute handle. The first one found in the grave containing the drum was painted red, whereas the second one was blue. The rattle end of both had originally contained from fifteen to twenty solid ceramic balls. The ends of both rattles are incised with side slits; feathers or some other kind of ornament may have been attached to these slits. The mouthpiece of the second instrument is a stubby, perpendicular projection from the handle. This instrument also has four stops, where the first one has two, so it can cover a wider range of the musical scale. The drum found in the first grave, finally, is of the tall, tubular "pedestal vase" variety. Painted red like the maraca-flute found in the same grave, it has a bowl-like body with slightly outcurving sides, mounted on a 30 Archaeology</page><page sequence="8">The "Water-Lily Woman " ocarina (left) was so- named because the flower she holds may represent a Maya symbol associated with the afterlife. Musicians would follow the litter to the graveside amid the mournful, hoarse sound of drums, rattles and flutes- a somber backdrop to a thousand-year-old rite of passage. somewhat narrower cylindrical or "pedestal" base. No drum cover sur- vived, but either one or both of the ends would originally have been cov- ered with some kind of membrane, probably animal or snake skin. Ceramic hand drums have been found, though often in a fragmentary condition, at a half-dozen sites, par- ticularly Late Classic centers in Belize -Barton Ramie, Benque Viejo, San Jose, and Altun Ha. The known pottery drums range in size from 15.6 to 30 centimeters (about six to 12 inches), which means that the drum from Pacbitun -which is 24 cen- timeters (about nine inches) high- falls neatly in the center of the range. The wooden drums we know of were larger than the hand drums, and came in several types, two of which were the tunkul and the pax. These drums, however, were probably played with drumsticks, and are known from the written and artistic records. Drums and rattles seem to have been commonly associated with one another by the ancient Maya. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel is a Maya holy book that records wide- spread beliefs and practices from ear- lier Maya periods. In this book there is a passage which says, "the drum and the rattle of the Lord of 11 Ahau shall resound." The expression "11 Ahau" is a calendar date; so the phrase "Lord of 11 Ahau" refers to the ruler of this period. This book was composed in the Maya language during the early post-Conquest period; though it was transcribed in Spanish letters, it is accepted by Mayanists as an important compen- dium of traditional Maya history and folklore. The murals at Bonampak also depict a hand drum being played by a man who is also holding a rattle. The rattle is painted red, and bright yellow-green feathers decorate the instrument's end. In addition, a beautiful ceramic figurine from Lubaantun in Belize de- picts a Maya tapping a hand drum which is tucked underneath his right arm while he holds a rattle in his right hand. Like the Bonampak mu- rals, this figurine dates from the Late Classic period. The sad, mournful sound of Maya drums brings us back to the funeral processions at Pacbitun. When we consider the instruments interred with the two women, we begin to imagine the scene as it may have been a thousand years ago. It would have begun with all the elaborate prepara- tions which preceded an elite burial: the tomb would be prepared; prized possessions and exotic offerings would be chosen for burial along with the deceased. Then there would be the full solemnity of a cortege-like procession to the exalted resting place. The spouse and children of the dead woman would be ornately dressed, as would other important persons and members of the family. Priests would intone special prayers while they burned copal (resinous- smelling) incense; and a dozen or more musicians would follow the lit- ter to the graveside amid the mourn- ful, hoarse sound of drums, raťtles and flutes -a somber backdrop to a thousand-year-old rite of passage. □ January/February 1988 31</page></plain_text>
