<plain_text><page sequence="1">DID IBN TAYMIYYA HAVE A SCREW LOOSE ? This study of the personality of Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) takes as its point of departure the judgment of Ibn Battaita (c. 779/1377) that Ibn Taymiyya was mentally unbalanced. While the primary aim of this article is to evaluate Ibn Battilta's opinion, a further purpose is to determine whether and how Ibn Taymiyya's personality affected his career, in particular whether the passionate partisanship which he aroused both for and against him can be attributed to any significant extent to his behavior. The equally intriguing and perhaps even more important question of the extent to which his personality affected his writings will not be discussed here since, as of yet, the chronology of his voluminous writings, many of which are still in manuscript, has not been fully worked out. Another question implicit in this study is whether the data available from medieval Islamic sources are sufficient for the purposes of meaningful psychological analysis. That Ibn Batiitta's pronouncement on Ibn Taymiyya's sanity is not a trivial matter is evident from a recent article in which Professor George Makdisi argues that this very dictum lies at the root of the prevalent scholarly view that Ibn Taymiyya and the IHanbali school stand "outside the mainstream of Muslim thought," and that this image of the shaykh, carelessly and uncritically repeated by Orientalists, has "helped to blur our vision of Islamic religious history."

LITTLE or not there is any justification for Ibn Batfiita's view is a question which Makdisi does not consider except indirectly, when he refers to Ibn Batftita as one of Ibn Taymiyya's "medieval detractors." (1) But if the charge should indeed be laid to rest to build our understanding of Ibn Taymiyya on a sound historical basis, it seems necessary to weigh the available evidence which sustains or refutes it. This is easier said than done, for, even if we ignore for the time being the primary data offered by Ibn Taymiyya's own writings, we are still confronted with a vast amount of material which has been recorded about him in chronicles, monographs, and biographical dictionaries, which is quite possibly greater in bulk and detail than that for any other medieval Muslim with the obvious exception of Mulhammad himself. (2) In addition to the difficulty posed by the quantity of the sources, there is also a question of quality since, in spite of the fact that many authors attacked Ibn Taymiyya's beliefs, there is hardly anyone who criticized his person. This is due in part to the coincidence that almost all his biographers were his suppor- ters, either as members of his Hanbali madhhab, like Ibn 'Abd al-Hddi (d. 744/1343-44) and Ibn Rajab (795/1392-93) or as adherents of what Professor Henri Laoust has called a group of "chafiites hanbalisants", or pro-.Hanbali Sh5fi'is, like al-Dhahabl (739/1339) and Ibn Kathir (774/1373), (3) though, as we shall see, al-Dhahabl constitutes a special case. There- fore, much of what has been written about Ibn Taymiyya falls into the category of hagiography of a type indicated by the very title of the fullest contemporary biographical source- Ibn 'Abd al-Hidi's al-'lUqad al-Durriyya min Mandqib Shaykh (1) Ibid., p. 118. Henri Laoust, Essai sur les doctrines sociales el politiques de Tali-d-Dtn Ahmad b.

(1) Nevertheless, from this mass of tendentious material it is possible to find evidence by which Ibn Battfita's judgment can be tested. First, however, we should scrutinize Ibn Baffiita's testimony; having done so, we shall compare it with other judgments of Ibn Taymiyya's personality and then attempt to reach conclusions of our own. The relevant passage in Ibn Battffta's Rihla comes in a description of his visit to Damascus in the year 726/1326. As was his custom, Ibn Batt4ila begins his description with the impressions of the earlier traveler Ibn Jubayr (614/1217); he then proceeds to describe the principal Islamic monument in Damascus, the Umayyad Mosque, still drawing heavily upon Ibn Jubayr, and then to enumerate the teachers at the mosque and the four chief qddis of the city. A section entitled hikdya (anecdote, story) follows in which Ibn Battilta talks about Ibn Taymiyya. I have translated the whole of this anecdote because I think it important to view Ibn BattAita's judgment in the full context in which he made it: "Among the chief IHanbali fuqahd' in Damascus was Taqi al-Din ibn Taymiyya who, although he enjoyed great prestige and could discourse on the scholarly disciplines, had a screw loose. (2) The people of Damascus held him in extreme respect. He used to preach to them from the minbar and once had discoursed in a manner which the fuqaha' found reprehensible, so that they reported him to al-Malik al-N.sir, who ordered him sent to Cairo. There the qddi[s and fuqaha' were convoked in the sultan's council chamber, where they were addressed by Sharaf al-Din al-ZuwwIl, who said, 'This (1) Ed.

LITTLE man said such-and-such', spelling out the reprehensible state- ments of Ibn Taymiyya and producing depositions to that effect which were placed before the chief qddI. When the latter asked for Ibn Taymiyya's reply, he said, 'There is no god but God', responding in like manner when the qaddi repeated the question. Al-Malik al-Ndsir ordered him put into prison, where he remained for some years and wrote a book of Qur'dn commentary which he entitled al-Bahr al-Muh.t in almost forty volumes. Later, his mother complained before al-Malik al-Ndsir, and he ordered his release. But then the same thing happened again while I was in Damascus. I was in attendance on a Friday when he was preaching to the people and exhorting them from the minbar of the cathedral mosque. In the course of his speech he said, 'God comes down to the sky of this world just as I come down now', and he descended one step of the minbar. A Milikl faqih known as Ibn al-Zahrd' remonstrated with him and denounced what he had said, whereupon the congregation rose against this faqih, striking him with their hands and shoes until his turban fell off, exposing a silk skullcap on his head. They rebuked him for wearing this and bore him to the house of 'Izz al-Din ibn Musallam, the qdd1 of the Hanballs, who ordered him to be imprisoned and then flogged. But the MdlikI and the Shdfi'i fuqahd' denounced this punishment and carried the matter to Malik al-Umari' Sayf al-DIn Tanklz, one of the good and virtuous am[rs, who wrote to al-Malik al-NZsir about the matter and sent a legal deposition against Ibn Taymiyya on such repre- hensible matters as the following: 'He who pronounces triple divorce with one phrase is bound only by one divorce'; 'The traveler who sets out to visit the Hallowed Tomb (may God increase its perfume) may not reduce his prayers'; and the like. He sent the deposition to al-Malik al-Nisir, who ordered Ibn Taymiyya to be imprisoned in the citadel. There he remained until he died" (1).

As is so often the case with Ibn BattAita, his chronology disputes his facts, for if, according to his own account, he did not arrive in Damascus until 9 Ramatdn 726/9 August 1326, he could not have seen Ibn Taymiyya preaching in a mosque since, according to independent sources, the latter was at this time in prison and had been so for a month 1 (x) Furthermore, it seems strange that there is no documentation for such an incident in other sources, which, on the contrary, argue that the reason for Ibn Taymiyya's imprisonment on this occasion was his stand on the issue of ziydra, or the visitation of tombs, (2) which in Ibn Battfita's version was only a subsidiary issue. Acording to the same sources, Ibn Taymiyya's opinions on the question of God's attributes (including nuzal-descent) were the cause of his troubles of an earlier date. (3) In fact, Ibn IHajar al-'Asqalni (852/1449) reports that an incident in which Ibn Taymiyya descended the steps of the minbar in order to illustrate his understanding of nuzal occurred as early as 705/1305.

See also Ivan Hrbek, "The Chronology of Ibn Bafitfta's Travels", Archiv Orientdlni, XXX (1962), 425, where it is asserted that Ibn Battfita could not have seen Ibn Taymiyya in Damascus and that he probably heard the hikdya from sources in Mecca I From this Hrbek concludes that Ibn Battfta "narrates something merely heard as if he were an eye-witness of the event. It follows from this that he is not to be trusted on similar occasions..."

LITTLE authority for this incident was a contemporary of Ibn Taymiyya, it is quite possible that Ibn BattAita also borrowed this account from the earlier source and claimed that he witnessed the incident himself in order to heighten the dramatic effect of the hikaya. There are other discrepancies as well; for instance, no other source claims that Ibn Taymiyya's mother ever intervened with the sultan for her son's release from prison; this, despite the fact that Ibn 'Abd al-Hadi reproduces a letter which Ibn Taymiyya wrote to his mother from prison in Egypt. (1) Nevertheless, many of Ibn Battita's details are correct: Muhammad 'Izz al-Din ibn Musallam was the Hanbali chief qdd. in Damascus at that time, (2) and it is well known that the amir Tankiz was serving then as viceroy of Damascus. (3) More importantly, the very fact that Ibn Battl2ta's report incriminates a fellow Maliki for wearing silk favors its authen- ticity. In short, it is possible that an incident involving descent from a minbar did occur during the same period that Ibn Taymiyya was under attack for his views on ziydra, that Ibn Baittia did witness it but misdated his visit to Damascus by a month when, years later, he dictated his memoirs. In any event, even if Ibn Battiita did not himself see Ibn Taymiyya, it is evident from the detailed information contained in the hikaya that he had heard or seen reports on Ibn Taymiyya's activities which convinced him that in spite of the shaykh's great learning and despite his prestige and popularity in Damascus, his beliefs and behavior seemed somewhat erratic. The impression left by the hikdya as a whole is that a man in full possession of his faculties would not flaunt blatantly anthropomorphic views in public, nor would he refuse to cooperate with the authorities if arrested and subjected to interrogation. He would certainly not repeat an offense for Taymiyya's disciples (Essai, p. 488, note 1). Given this independent reference to Ibn Taymiyya's nuzrl from one of his followers, it is difficult to accept Laoust's verdict that Ibn Battfita's report on a similar incident was an "6tonnante calomnie" I (ibid., p. 481).

But this is obviously a matter of Ibn Battuita's personal opinion, and the same data might be interpreted to prove that Ibn Taymiyya was a hero, defying the state to defend his own views. There- fore, since Ibn Battiita's report is suspect and his opinion debatable, we should look for estimates of Ibn Taymiyya's personality in other sources. Hagiographical material which was intended to glorify Ibn Taymiyya's words and deeds is plentiful. Ibn 'Abd al-Haidl, for example, closes his' Uqad with verse eulogies of Ibn Taymiyya from no less than twenty-eight of his contemporaries, (1) and Ibn Nisir al-Din (842/1438-39) collected testimony from eighty-five 'ulamd' who agreed that Ibn Taymiyya was deserving of the lofty title shaykh al-islam. (2) But the fact that Ibn Taymiyya received lavish praise does not necessarily mean that he did not deserve it. To the contrary, beneath the rhetorical exaggeration with which Ibn Taymiyya was eulogized, it is clear that he must have been an exceptional person to evoke such universal respect. The best proof of this lies in his enemies' acknowledgment that his life was exemplary. For example, the MilikI chief qZf.i of Egypt, Ibn Makhlif (718/1318), who had been largely responsible for Ibn Taymiyya's early trials and tribulations in Egypt, (3) eventually conceded that "There is no one more righteous than Ibn Taymiyya; we should abandon our struggle against him." (4) Even Taqi al-Din al-Subki (756/1355), who wrote tracts attacking Ibn Taymiyya's beliefs (5) and is characterized by Laoust as an adversary of the shaykh, (6) confided the following estimate to al-Dhahabi: (1) Pp. 393-517.

LITTLE "As for what you say in regard to al-Shaykh Taqi al-Din, I am convinced of the great scope, the ocean-like fullness and vastness of his knowledge of the transmitted and intellectual sciences, his extreme intelligence, his exertions and his attain- ments, all of which surpass description. I have always held this opinion. Personally, my admiration is even greater for the asceticism, piety, and religiosity with which God has endowed him, for his selfless championship of the truth, his adherence to the path of our forebears, his pursuit of perfection, the wonder of his example, unrivalled in our time and in times past " (1). Although al-Subki might be charged with indulging in a bit of if.nab-exaggeration, literary licence-here, it is difficult to challenge such a characterization of Ibn Taymiyya when it is so consistently repeated by friends and foes alike. But to concede to Ibn Taymiyya a host of virtues is not to exculpate him of all defects. Amidst all the paeans can be found a lonely plaint of discontent. The most explicit criticism of Ibn Taymiyya as a person comes in an epistle entitled al-Nasha al-Dhahabiyya li-Ibn Taymiyya (Golden/ al-Dhahabi's Advice to Ibn Taymiyya), (2) apparently from the pen of the famous historian and hadilh scholar al-Dhahabl, though this, as we shall see, is a matter of some dispute. Couched in the form of nasTha (friendly counsel), the epistle contains a blistering attack against Ibn Taymiyya's attitude toward his fellow 'ulamd', specifically against his pride, his obstinancy, intolerance, captiousness, and lack of tact. In al-Dhahabl's view this combination of traits blinded Ibn Taymiyya to his own faults as well as to the virtues of his adversaries and led him to surround himself with sycophants. A few excerpts will suffice to illustrate the nature and tone of this document: (1) Ibn Ijajar, Durar, I, 169. (2) In Baydn Zaghal al-'llm, ed. M. Z. al-KawtharI, Damascus (al-Qudsl) 1348/1928-29, pp. 31-34.</page><page sequence="9">DID IBN TAYMIYYA HAVE A SCREW LOOSE? 101 "Blessed is he whose fault diverts him from the faults of others! Damned is he whom others divert from his own faults ! How long will you look at the motes in the eye of your brother, forgetting the stumps in your own? How long will you praise yourself and your prattling phrases while disparaging the 'ulama' and pursuing other people's weak- nesses? (1) By God, you must leave us alone! You are contentious and are endowed with a learned tongue which does not pause or rest! Beware of captious questions in religions... Too much talk without proof hardens hearts...

Are not most of your disciples crippled and bound, of facile intelligence or blind, liars, stupid, strange, crafty, or dessicated, virtuous without understanding? If you don't believe me, inspect them, weigh them with justice" (4) ! All this and more, al-Dhahabl avers, is the constructive criticism of a friend, offered only for Ibn Taymiyya's own good: "I do not expect you to accept my words or hearken to my admonition; instead you will strive to produce volumes in refutation of this one page. You will snip off the tails of my words relentlessly, until I retreat into absolute silence ! If this is your attitude toward me-someone who regards you with love and affection-how will you treat your enemies, (1) Ibid., p. 32.

I will be content if you curse me in public as long as you heed my words in private" (1). All these are strong words which paint an even less flattering portrait of Ibn Taymiyya than that suggested by Ibn Battlfita. Furthermore, al-Dhahabl's judgment is all the more cutting since he is known to have been one of those Shdfi'is who held the Ash'aris in contempt and, according to al-Subki, "had a strong inclination for Ijanball opinions", an inclination which led him to frequent Ibn Taymiyya's company and to accept his guidance. (2) Al-Dhahabl's judgment is so severe, in fact, that two scholars, M. Y. Kokan 'Umri and M. A. H. BhuijIydni, have claimed that al-Dhahabl could not possibly have written it, arguing that it does not conform to his high opinion of Ibn Taymiyya expressed elsewhere and pointing to the absence of references to such a risala in contem- porary sources. (3) Neither objection is convincing. Although contemporary biographers did not include the epistle in lists of al-Dhahabi's writings, al-Sakhwli (853/1449), writing about a hundred years later, states that he had seen such a work by al-Dhahabl. (4) Moreover, al-Sakhwli quotes, without identifying, another treatise in which al-Dhahabl offers further criticism of Ibn Taymiyya, as follows: "Though I have spent long years considering and investigating Ibn Taymiyya, I have found that the only reasons why the (1) Ibid., p. 34.

This passage comes from al-Dhahabi's Baydn Zaghal al-'lIlm, (2) also regarded as spurious by Bhfijiydni for the same reasons mentioned above. (3) But the fact is that the opinions expressed in both these treatises faithfully reflect al-Dhahabi's judgment of Ibn Taymiyya expressed in sources of undisputed authenticity. In general, the best way, probably the only way, to characterize al-Dhahabl's feelings toward Ibn Taymiyya is to say that they were ambivalent. His praise of the shaykh is routinely eulogistic, but it is invariably qualified by criticism. Unlike Ibn Battfita's remarks, al-Dhahabl's were firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of the shaykh which resulted from their common interests and their resultant association in Damascus. Both were hadTih scholars, distrustful of philosophy and theology and attempts to formulate Islam in scholastic terms. The bulk of al-Dhahabi's writing is related in some way or another to hadlth, either to 'ilm al-rijdl, the science which investigates the reliability of transmitters of hadith, or to history, whose very roots and methods lay in the field of had[th. Ibn Taymiyya's works were more theoretical in content and approach but his interest in had[Ih is evident from the numerous books which he wrote on fiqh and usail al-fiqh and from his heavy reliance on had[th as a source of documentation for his opinions expressed in other types of works. Both men held teaching appointments as professors of had[th at institutions in Damascus: Ibn Taymiyya at Ddr al-.Hadith al-Sukkariyya and al-Madrasa al-IHanbaliyya; (4) al-Dhahabi at the Nafisiyya and F5diliyya madrasas and also at Dar al-Hadith al-Sukkariyya, where he succeeded Ibn (1) Ibid.

LITTLE Taymiyya. (1) Finally, al-Dhahabi was a member of a group of Damascus Shafi'is who, according to al-Subki, were adversely influenced by Ibn Taymiyya: "The group comprised of al-Mizzi, al-Dhahabl, al-BirzIil, and many of their followers was clearly harmed by Abui al-'Abbds ibn Taymiyya, who led them to gross acts of no little consequence and drew them to things that they should have avoided..." (2) Yet, in spite of (or perhaps because of) their association, their mutual interests, and their agreement on some issues, it is evident that al-Dhahabi's admiration for Ibn Taymiyya was always tempered by consi- derable misgivings. This ambivalence, and al-Dhahabl's own awareness of it, emerges most clearly from a remarkable statement of this attitude which has been preserved most fully by Ibn IHajar: "People who know him well sometimes accuse me of failing to do him justice; his opponents sometimes charge me with puffery. I have been abused by both parties-his supporters and his adversaries. (His hair and beard were salt-and pepper colored, containing little gray, his hair reaching his ear lobes. His eyes were like eloquent tongues. Of medium height, he was broad shouldered and had a loud, expressive voice and was quick of speech.) Though anger would sometimes grip him, he would conquer it with forbearance. I have not seen his like for supplications and appeals and for his abundant concern for others. But I do not believe him to be infallible; indeed, I disagree with him on both basic and secondary issues. For, despite his vast learning, his extreme courage, his fluid mind, and his regard for the sanctities of religion, he was but a man " (3). Scattered throughout various sources are other comments traceable to al-DhahabI which reveal more warts. From al-Dhahabl, al-Safadl (764/1363) reports that Ibn Taymiyya (1) Moh.

(1) Ibn Rajab (795/1393), the IHanbalI biographer, also quotes al-Dhahabli, repeating the last adjective and adding that he was "impetuous", and that his anger turned him into "a raging lion" (layth harib). (2) The same author, on the same authority, repeats that Ibn Taymiyya's behavior was unpredictable, so that "he might extol an acquaintance on one occasion but insult him on others." (S) All these characteristics are consistent with a more general and charitable estimate of Ibn Taymiyya given by al-Dhahabi, which, it seems to me, provides a key to what we know about the shaykh. According to al-Dhahabi, Ibn Taymiyya was completely dedicated to a cause and "took pleasure in nothing but propagating and recording religious learning and acting in accordance with it, so that he took no interest whatsoever in the pleasures of this world-food, clothes, or sexual intercourse." (4) In this respect it is significant that he never married, which is, of course, highly unusual for a Muslim, nor did he take concubines. (5) When- ever he had any money he gave it away, so that his affairs had to be managed by his brothers. (6) All these impressions come from al-Dhahabl. Can we be sure that his view of Ibn Taymiyya was not distorted by his own emotions and feelings? This is difficult if not impossible to say in the absence of data on al-Dhahabi's own personality, though the tone of his remarks indicates that he was objective rather than envious, fed up and frustrated rather than malicious. In addition, there are some data from other, independent, sources which tend to corroborate al-Dhahabi's judgment. (1) Al-Wdft bi-al-Wafaydt, VI, ed. IIhsfn 'Abbis, Wiesbaden (Franz Steiner Verlag) 1969, 18. (2) Al-Dhayl 'ald Tabaqdt al-HIandbila, ed. Muhammad H.imid al-FiqI, II, Cairo (Maktabat al-Sunna al-Mulhammadiyya) 1953, 395. (3) Ibid. (4) Ibid., p. 390. The same judgment appears in al-SafadI's Wiff, VII, 16, except that for "sexual intercourse" (al-jim'), al-SafadI substitutes "worldly repose" (al-rihia al-dunyawiyya) I (5) Ibn Rajab, Dhayl, II, 395; also Ibn al-Wardl, Ta'rfkh, II, Najaf (al-Matba'a al-I.aydariyya) 1969, 412.

Although Muslim bio- graphers rarely record material on a person's childhood except to display signs of abnormally early virtue or achievement, al-Safadi has preserved an anecdote on Ibn Taymiyya's child- hood, when he was studying with members of another prominent IHanball family of Damascus, that inadvertently shows that the violent temper and the presumptuousness noticed by al-Dhahabi was evident at an early age: "When Ibn Taymiyya was a little boy, studying with the Banil Munajji, they supported something that he denied, whereupon they produced the text. When he had read it, he threw it down in fury (ghayzan). They said, 'How bold you are to cast from your hand a volume that contains knowledge !' He quickly replied, 'Who is better, Moses or I?' 'Moses', they said. And which is better-this book or the tablets on which the ten commandments were inscribed?' 'The tablets', they replied. Ibn Taymiyya said, in words to this effect, 'Well, when Moses became angry, he threw down the tablets'" (1)! Another anecdote from al-Safadi serves to confirm al- Dhahabi's observation that Ibn Taymiyya was oblivious to his worldly surroundings. This one tells how once Ibn Taymiyya consumed, without complaint, a squash which his mother had discarded because it was too bitter to eat! (2) Even more indicative of his complete absorption in his religious cause is his profession of indifference to the various forms of punishment which might be inflicted upon him: "What can my enemies do to me? My Garden (jannaUl wa-bustan[) is in my heart; wherever I go, it goes with me. My prison is solitude! My death is martyrdom! Exile is a journey" (3) ! (1) Wdft, VII, 17. (2) Ibid., p. 18.

Examples of such behavior are readily available from secondary sources, and we need only recall such episodes as his rash confrontations with Mongol officials, (1) his boldness in preaching jihad to the Mamliik sultan against the Mongols, (2) his destruction of a holy relic attributed to the Prophet, (3) his daring expose of the charle- tanism of the Rifa'i dervishes, (4) his presumptousness in releasing his follower al-MizzI from prison, (5) his refusals to obey the Mamlilk authorities, (6) his tactless denunciation of the Copts when all the other 'ulamd' saw the wisdom of silence. (7) So single-minded was his devotion to religious principles, so intolerant of idleness and vanity, that, according to Ibn 'Abd al-Hadl, he converted the prison in which he was incarcerated in Egypt into an institute of religious study and devotion, turning the inmates away from chess and trictrac to prayer ! (8) Even when he was marching though the streets of Cairo on his way to what his followers saw as certain assasination, he could not resist stopping briefly to kick over a backgammon board when he spied two men playing a game outside a black- smith's shop ! (9) It will be evident, I think, to anyone who reads the sources that al-Dhahabl's opinion of Ibn Taymiyya was justified. Although he was obviously a great and brilliant man whose main virtues were courage, piety, self-denial, and vast knowledge, he also had the faults which al-Dhahabl named, the chief (1) Laoust, "La Biographie d'Ibn Taimlya d'aprbs Ibn Katir", Bulletin d'rtludes Orientales, IX (1942-45), 123-24.

LITTLE ones being a violent temper (which, admittedly, he learned to control), intolerance of human imperfection, and stern inflexibility. All of these qualities, both good and bad, made him an exceptional person, set apart from his fellow 'ulamd', including al-Dhahabi himself, who were molded from softer clay. The questions with which we prefaced this study remain. The first question can now be reformulated as follows: Does al-Dhahabi's opinion of Ibn Taymiyya confirm Ibn Battita's? If Ibn Battfita meant that Ibn Taymiyya was even slightly majnan-mad, possessed by jinn-his remark should be dismissed out of hand, for there is not a shred of supporting evidence from any other source, including al-Dhahabl. But it is obvious that Ibn Battita had no such intent, and we should remember that his unkind remark, "illa anna fi~ aqlihi shay'an", qualifies the more generous observations that Ibn Taymiyya was "kabhr al-sha'n yatakallam ft al-funiin... wa-kdna ahl Dimashq yu'azzimCinahu ashadd al-ta'.zcm." (1) In other words, Ibn Battaita's judgment was not altogether condem- natory but was tempered by a tribute, even if we can deduce that it was grudging. Viewing the offensive phrase in context, I think that he meant only that Ibn Taymiyya did not have self-restraint and discretion enough to act in his own best interest, without constantly creating a public uproar. If this interpretation is correct, (2) it is difficult to deny the validity of Ibn BattAiita's characterization since it is corroborated on more than one occasion by al-Dhahabl. It is cruel, perhaps, and even flippant, but it is not without a grain of truth. How did Ibn Taymiyya's personality influence his checkered career as a reformer? In at least two ways. First, as we have seen from al-NasTha al-Dhahabiyya and Zaghal al-'Ilm, al-Dhahabi implied that Ibn Taymiyya had brought all his troubles upon himself; that, had he exercised a modicum of (1) Defr6mery and Sanguinetti, Voyages, I, 215. (2) In a more restricted sense, Ibn Battata may have meant merely that although Ibn Taymiyya could hold forth on all the scholarly disciplines, the ideas that he expressed seemed irrational.</page><page sequence="17">DID IBN TAYMIYYA HAVE A SCREW LOOSE? 109 tact, a bit of self-control in his relations with his fellow 'ulamd' and with the authorities of the Mamlilk state, he not only would have saved himself and others much grief but would have enjoyed greater success in propagating his views. This opinion is reiterated elsewhere: "In discussion he would be possessed by rage, anger, and hostility against his adversaries, which implanted enmity in their spirits. If he had only treated his antagonists with civility, they would have been reconciled with him, for the most notable of them deferred to his learning, acknowledged his ardent zeal (shughaf), and agreed that his lapses (khi.') were few" (1) Not that he was implacably antagonistic and invariably unyielding. The fact, according to Ibn 'Abd al-HMdi, that he refused to sanction the plan of al-Malik al-NMsir to execute their common enemies and, indeed, counselled him to forgive them is sufficient proof that he could be magnanimous. (2) Nevertheless, it seems clear that his unwillingness to appease his adversaries or even to cultivate friends contributed substan- tially to his difficulties with the Mamlfik political and religious establishment. On the other hand, it seems probable that the very traits which aroused the hatred of his enemies and the disapproval of al-Dhahabl won the admiration of his supporters. Here again we leave aside the content of his beliefs, on the assumption that though they were undoubtedly an important factor to his fellow "ulamd', they must have been less significant to partisans drawn from "virtuous persons among the soldiers and the amirs, the merchants and nobles, and all the common people, who loved him because he always stood up for their welfare with his tongue and his pen." (8) Surely such people would have been impressed by his courage and boldness, which, we are told, were proverbial; (4) in fact, (1) Ibn .Hajar (citing al-Dhahabl), Durar, I, 161. (2) Ibn 'Abd al-Hidl, 'Uqiid, pp. 282-83; Laoust, Essai, pp. 140-41. (3) Ibn 'Abd al-Hidl, 'Uqad, p. 118. (4) Ibn Rajab, Dhayl, II, 395.</page><page sequence="18">110 DONALD P. LITTLE his fame is said to have begun when he displayed these very qualities in an interview he is alleged to have had with the Ilkh-n Gh5zin. (1) Moreover, it is hard to believe that Ibn Taymiyya's stubborn devotion to principle, his outspokenness and zeal, his defiance of authority, his scorn for his adversaries- however much they may have displeased al-Dhahabi--did not seem like admirable traits to many of his supporters, those, that is, who were already inclined to support him on the basis of his doctrines. Admiration for these traits must have been an important factor behind the mass support to which Ibn Batt~ia alludes and the itifluence he is known to have had with various officials of the Mamlflk state. (2) In other words, I would suggest that had Ibn Taymiyya followed al-Dhahabi's advice and modeled his personality and behavior on the pattern of his fellow 'ulamd'-that is, had he cooperated with his colleagues and collaborated with the Mamlilk authorites, toning down his preaching and his conduct in order to "maintain a low profile"-his impact on Mamlfik society would have been considerably diminished. Finally, is there enough material in the sources for a meaning- ful psychological analysis? As far as I am concerned, the answer must be no, though there are certainly clues enough to arouse the curiosity of a psychohistorian-e.g., the upheaval in his childhood caused by the necessity to flee from the Mongols, his fiery temper dating from childhood, his self-absorption and unsociability, his defiance of authority, his celibacy, his devotion to his mother, not to mention the conservatism of his views. But this line of inquiry, it seems to me, would be highly speculative, given the paucity of supportive data in the sources. A more rewarding approach would lead us back to Ibn Taymiyya's writings, where we might now justifiably look for reflections of those traits which al-Dhahabi found in his (1) Ibn Ijajar, Durar, I, 164. (2) E. g., with the governor of Syria al-AmIr Aqfsh al-Afram (716/1316); Salfr, Viceroy of Egypt (710/1310); the King of the Syrian Arabs, Muhannd ibn 'Isa (735/1235); and, according to Laoust, al-Malik al-N.sir himself.

At any rate, it is thanks largely to al-Dhahabi that Ibn Taymiyya is one of the few medieval Muslim thinkers who speak to us now not as a disembodied, impersonal voice but as a very real, very human person. If we want to understand the nature of the Ibn Taymiyyan phenomenon, by which I mean the full impact of his activities and his writings on the develop- ment of Islam, we must surely start with the nature of the man himself.
