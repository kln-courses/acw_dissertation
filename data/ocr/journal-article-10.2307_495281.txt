Hegel, Encyclopedia par. 24 1. A Note on Method One of the first things to strike the attention of a novice in Redology (Hung-hsiieh, or the study of Ts'ao Hsieh-ch'in's novel Dream of the Red Chamber) is the way that almost all the criticism on the novel seems less an examination of the text than a con- tinuation of it on other planes of discourse. It is not simply that critics borrow themes and metaphors from the text-that happens to some extent in all criticism. The odd thing is that all the most perceptive critical literature that this novel has generated seems less to describe the book than to act out the novel's tensions, symbols and structures. Sooner or later, all the concerns of its interpreters find in the novel their reflection and indeed something like their definitive statement. "Reflection" may not be quite the right word, for it is precisely the traditional metaphorics of reflection as a relation between an object and an independent subject that seem not to apply here. Wishing to talk about the novel, the reader becomes a means for the novel to add new episodes to itself. This testifies to the novel's imaginative power. But what kind of power is it? How is it exerted? Is it specific to the Hung-lou-meng? Isolating it will be the business of this essay. One way of beginning to look for this power might be to point out that the story of the Hung-lou-meng is in many ways the story of an interpretation. Oddly, though, the episodes that center on problems of interpretation have received the least attention from readers. It seems that most of the scholarship on the novel is far more intimately guided by other symbols: the garden setting of the Ta-Kuan Yiian, for instance, or the relations between its protagonists. Could it be that the point of those passages which criticism has tended to ignore is so obvious as not to need examining? Perhaps by going back to them we can learn something about our predicament as readers. In any case, we can expect-whether we consciously wish it or not-to find in these fictional versions of reading a mirror of our own situation. 2. Autobiographical Displacements I will begin, however, with an example of the more familiar kind of reading-the reading of a fictional work by a literary critic - and show how it turns uncanny; then we will see that we have all along been part of a more inclusive scene of reading where the novel is both the thing read and one of its own readers. One can imagine a reader for whom the richest, most suggestive part of the novel would be the four or five pages excised by the author from chapters 12 and 13 and 23</page><page sequence="2">24 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) never completely made up for afterwards. To such a reader, those pages would be the novel's great secret, the skeleton in its closet, and essential to it in the way that a repressed symptom is essential to a neurotic's behavior. Nothing could disappoint that reader more than to have those pages back again; the novel would seem poorer and emptier with them than without them. Almost everything we know about the missing pages and their excision comes from marginal comments in old manuscript copies. The commentators' exhaustive knowledge of the Ts'ao family's affairs and their patent emotional involvement with the book often lead them to propose correlations between the novel's inner (autobiographical) and outer (imaginary) faces; many of these correlations have since become canonical. The passage we are about to consider is something of an exception, though, in that it records a deliberate effort to pry the two apart. In the "Chih-yen-chai" lti : family of manuscripts, unsigned comments at the end of chapter 13 tell us that one of the original readers was so touched by the advice given Wang Hsi-feng by Ch'in K'e-ch'ing's ghost that he ordered Ts'ao to rewrite the chapter and give Ch'in a better end. (In the original version she had hanged herself after the discovery of her incestuous relationship with her father-in-law.) Ts'ao complied, making K'e-ch'ing die of an unexplained wasting sickness and following her death with a hyperbolically lavish funeral in which her grief-stricken father-in-law acts the part of principal mourner. A comment dated 1762, reputedly the year of the novelist's death, runs: "This whole chapter disguises [the facts about] how K'e-ch'ing died. A great act of pity and kindness. Alas!"' Most recent students of the novel (e.g. Hu Shih M1 Yii P'ing-po B 1Wti and Wu Shih-ch'ang AL ti-4 ) accept the annotator's version of things and draw the natural conclusion: if it was so important to cover up K'e-ch'ing's suicide, then it must have alluded to some real event, some painful memory familiar to Ts'ao and his intimates. The "historian's pen" (ty) could not record it directly, and so had to be replaced by the poet's. But that is not all: in the end it is the annotator (whom we shall call, for convenience's sake, Chih-yen-chai) who appears as witness and takes on the historian's role. Emerging from the shadows in a note, he tells us himself what he could not bear to let the novelist say. Chih-yen-chai stands, like a customs official, on the borders of truth and fiction, but the uses he makes of that strategic post are somewhat ambiguous and one can rightly ask whose interests he really serves there.2 The second thoughts that follow from his 1Quoted in Yii P'ing-po / rf9?t ,ed., Chih-yen-chai Hung-lou-meng chi-p'ing  ~ ,E R it'; (Hong Kong: T'ai-p'ing shu- chii, 1975), p. 169.

Boundaries deserve special attention in a novel where frame-stories, gateways, inscribed doorways, garden walls, imperial protection and mises en abyme count for so much. The subject has been explored with great care by a group of critics who take the Ta-Kuan Yiian as a kind of synecdochic metaphor for the whole novel. See Stephen C.

By indicating his reasons for wanting the old version removed, Chih-yen-chai restores it, at least in outline, and renders superfluous the act of "pity and kindness" he had begged Ts'ao to perform. This little drama played out in the wings of the novel between author and reader, with its incompletely smothered scandal, its secrets unveiled by the very business of covering them up and the attendant rhetoric of guilt and pity call to mind Freud's "topographical" or "censorship" model for the production of dreams.3 It would not even be a particularly wild departure from the biographical researches of Wu Shih-ch'ang or Yiu P'ing-po to cast Ts'ao as the Freudian dreamer within whom various repressed contents struggle for symbolic liberation, K'e-ch'ing or her real-life counterpart as the originally disturbing "contents of consciousness" that had to be reworked into an acceptable form, and Chih-yen-chai as the internal dream censor. Here as in the "dreamwork" of Freud's patients, the objectionable contents are never buried away and gotten rid of once and for all: the material that had to be cut out leaves a palpable gap of ten pages which the remorseful "censor" then feels obliged to account for, thus touching off a new cycle in the seemingly inevitable "return of the repressed." Of course, the revision we have singled out is not the only surviving evidence of an incompletely suppressed "K'e-ch'ing stratum": the mysterious illness to which she succumbs in the substitute version is signalled by an excess of "fire" generated by the heart and impairing the function of her other organs;4 there is the scene in which the porter Chiao Ta, drunk one night, loses enough of his inhibitions to start shouting out some of the family secrets in public; and the prophetic Register glimpsed by Pao-yti on his visit to Ching-huan confirms, with its uncensored image of the young woman hanging in the tower, the original version of K'e-ch'ing's death. Materials from the suppressed suicide story, excised from the working drafts of chapters 12 and 13, come back in slightly altered form to compose the Ch'in K'e-ch'ing we know from the annotated manuscripts and printed versions-just as the former Hui-fang Yiian with its T'ien-hsiang Tower and impure associations is covered up by the later "realm of innocence," the Ta-Kuan Yiuan. No one will deny that the Hung-lou-meng abounds in autobiographical clues; the difficulty is knowing how to use them. If the "foreword" ( iW l Y--[ , etc.) prefixed to chapter one-a note whose authorship is still variously debated-is to be trusted, the novel should be read as an elegy for the charming girls who adorned the author's childhood. In this view fiction is a "disguised statement" ( ?f*... ) of fact. But if we were to apply this reasoning across the board and read the novel as a pure roman t clef, more serious obstacles than a lack of evidence would soon make themselves known. One such obstacle is the couplet posted on the entryway to Ching-huan's fairyland realm: fy f1.'., , '~ 4 /_Jj , which David Hawkes translates as: "Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true;! Real becomes not-real where the unreal's real."' What does this enigmatic sentence refer to? It puts forth a moral principle that reprinted in Fang Tzu-shen fiJj4l et al., Chung-kuo ku-tien hsiao-shuo yen-chiu| rtI[ft;[p~-, j,~ [Taipei: Chung-hua wen-hua fu-hsing ytieh-k'an, 1977], pp. 289-302.) 3See Sigmund Freud, Die Traumdeutung (Frankfurt am Main: Fischer, 1977), pp. 234-235 ff. 4Cf.

The "happy few" will know which parts are remembered and which are invented, and the rest of us had better refrain from guessing. But in its generality the sentence also seems to spring back to a position nearly the opposite of that. It is only in appearance that, when we read the Hung-lou-meng as an autobiographical work, we are juxtaposing the novel to something that is not a novel; it might be truer to say that we build a second novel around the one we are given.6 When narrative fiction is read as autobiographical fact, all the facts become part of the imaginary too. The famous gateway inscription warns us to be careful and separate truth from fiction, at the same time reminding us that we cannot really be sure which is which. This condition is-despite our weaker mastery of the facts-common to us and such early readers as Chih-yen-chai. It is not only that "art" is not always a transformed version of "life," but also that any version of "life" is likely to incorporate touches of "art." A bit of healthy respect for the ambiguities is therefore in order. Chao Kang has condensed the strategies of the "biographical" school of readers in a memorable figure: such a method reads (i.e. isolates a non-evident structure of meanings from textual information) by splitting the work into two levels: a "master" level of historical information and a "subordinate" level of imagination ( -L and j ).7 The corresponding terms in Freudian theory would be: a primary stratum of repressed material and its worked-up fictional counterpart. The model of "master" and "slave" applies equally well, with the terms reversed, to strategies aiming to preserve the text's purely literary interest; so the problem is going to be one of choosing sides. Lest it seem that by calling on Freud as an authority we have prejudged the problem, it should be remembered that the splitting of evidence into "art" and "life" is internal to the analyst's work. Presented with stories claimed to be "reproductions of real occurrences, to which it is possible to ascribe an influence over the course of the patient's later life," the analytic interpreter must always allow for the possibility of their being "products of the imagination.., intended to serve as some kind of symbolic representation of real wishes and interests."8 "Symbolic representation" is quite a different matter from actual traumatic "influence," and so the introduction of screen memories greatly complicates the model of repression and displacement we appealed to earlier. Logically speaking, the "memories" emerging from their fictitious "repression" would be on a par with the dreams and neurotic symptoms they might be thought to "explain"; so that a supposed "cause" might be contemporary with, or even a result of, its own results. When reading the Hung-lou-meng we are dogged by a similar skepticism. The biographical "truth" comes in a shell of novelistic "fantasy," or it may well be the inverse. In any case it is unlikely that we should have it both ways. Is there any chance of our breaking out of this vicious circle? It is of course fair game to question the pertinence of individual "clues" thought to provide extra-literary information, or to ask whether something has not been left out when the connections 6I am thinking particularly of works like Kao Yang's fictionalized biography of Ts'ao Hsieh-ch'in (Ts'ao Hsiieh-ch'in pieh-chuan. Taipei: Lien-ching, 1982). 7Chao Kang, article cited previously, p. 290. 8Sigmund Freud, "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis," in Muriel Gardiner, ed., The Wolf-Man (New York: Basic Books, 1971), p. 192.</page><page sequence="5">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 27 between life and art are made too automatically. But what if the fictional text could be shown to be sufficient in itself to account for all the historical and quasi-historical dimensions ascribed to it? That would give it a kind of priority, even if only a methodo- logical one, over the biographical materials supposed to be "primary." In that case it would indeed be within the bounds of the question to turn the biographical method upside down and read the events of the novel as "constructions" instead of as "recollec- tions." But these questions cannot be answered by remote control; they require a plunge into actual reading. 3. Ch'in K'e-ch'ing and Chien-mei One hardly needs a sophisticated interpretative apparatus to recognize the importance Ch'in K'e-ch'ing's name and memory have for the book as a whole. Major set-piece scenes involving her, directly or through consequences and implications, reach to every part of the book; her name comes up even in the last chapter of the continuation by Kao E as Chia Cheng and Chia Jung accompany her coffin to the family tomb in the South. No single scene seems to be more valuable for determining why she matters so much than Pao-yti's dream-vision in chapter five, where she is the agent of a revelation and is ascribed a supernatural origin at the same time as her death is obscurely foretold. What seems to have attracted less attention, though, is the way in which the whole dream-vision lets itself be read as a rhetorical embroidery around the figure of Ch'in K'e-ching. The chapter's first sentence (or, again, an explanatory remark by some external hand; but the manuscript commentators seem to have no hesitation in ascribing it to the author) peremptorily announces: "Since the fourth chapter has already told how Mrs. Hsiieh and her children came to live in Jung-kuo Mansion, this chapter will say no more about them. Now from the day Lin Tai-yii had entered the household..."9 And the commentators have a reason for this swerve away from the Hsiiehs. "[The author] leaves off telling about Pao-ch'ai and moves to telling about Tai-yti. This is because the previous chapter, intended merely to introduce Pao-ch'ai, could not give an exhaustive description of her. Had this chapter continued with Pao-ch'ai the two Jades [Pao-yii and Tai-yti] would have been put aside and forgotten."10 The narrative promises, with "unaccustomed" directness (as the commentators describe it), to change its direction, but hardly more than a sentence or two on the new topic are past when it reverts to what it had promised not to talk about: Pao-ch'ai and her family, this time seen from Tai-yti's point of view. Here too a comment supplies the motive: "This transition to Tai-yti is a stroke of genius indeed! How so? Because, since to describe Tai-yti is really to describe Pao-ch'ai, it was never in the least [the narrator's] real intention to talk about Tai-yti. Here again I was almost taken in by the author." As if by enchantment, what ought to be one person's history and point of view is transformed without warning into another's. The storytelling voice seems to ramble, but in its inconsequentiality lie "strokes of genius" for those who know. When slightly further down we are told that Pao-yti and Tai-yti grew so intimate that "there was practically no telling them apart" (  @v ) it seems that clarity and particularization of point 9HLM, I, 69. 'oYii P'ing-po, p. 72.</page><page sequence="6">28 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) of view are more than can be expected here-unless, above and beyond questions of fictional technique, this is one of those obscure "dropped hints" that the manuscript commentators are always alluding to. After a few more lines of retrospective summary the principals are all brought into the Hui-Fang Yuian for a plum-viewing party. That place-name itself is "food for thought," as Chih-yen-chai observes ( T - J, )"; it might mean the "Garden of Collected Fragrances" or, just as well, the "Garden of Meeting-with-Fragrance"-fragrance being one of the book's most insistent metonymies for female beauty. Pao-yti drinks more than a boy his age ought to and is led off amid much scandalized tittering to have a nap in the room of his nephew's wife, Ch'in K'e-ch'ing. "Fragrance" is naturally the first and strongest sensation to assail him on crossing into the women's apartments, and the fragrance-fragrant person synecdoche is reaffirmed when the name of the maid closest to him is encrypted in the phrase transmitting this sensation ( ft i ,Jtti , with perhaps a crueler pun on 7 ?). 12 Where an allegory of studious dedication had hung in the outer, men's, part of the house, flanked with an admonitory couplet that "hardly induces one to dream" (Chih-yen-chai again), the fragrant inner room is decorated with a picture by T'ang Yin g~iV , whose elegant women reappear as a touchstone of beauty throughout the book, and a poem on a related theme by the suggestively named Ch'in T'ai-hsii Lc . ("Tai-hsii" = "the Immense Void.") "The last word in luxury and lustfulness," says Chih-yen-chai of these furnishings. "We are already in the dream world.""3 Pao-yti is already half asleep by the time he is tucked in. K'e-ch'ing sends the attendant maids outside "to watch the cats and dogs fighting on the eaves," while Pao-yi "still seemed to see K'e-ch'ing's wavering form in front of him. He followed her to a certain place..." It would be pointless to retell the whole dream here. What ought to catch our attention, and seems to have caught Chih-yen-chai's too, is that it should have been "necessary to enter the dream with K'e-ching, and to come out of it with her too. -Hard to see what this means. -Read the whole book and you'll know."14 Within the dream, K'e-ch'ing vanishes early on and is replaced by the fairy maiden Ching-huan. After Pao-yi has failed to understand any of the riddling predictions played out in front of him, she reappears as Ching-huan's last means of instruction, introduced by her as "my little sister. Her childhood name was Chien-mei, her nickname is K'e-ch'ing, and I have chosen her to be your bride."'" When Pao-yhi awakens with a shriek the real K'e-ch'ing, still outside ordering the maids to do something about the cats and dogs on the roof (a time-lapse device familiar from plays like the Huang-liang meng g t ), is astonished to hear him calling out her childhood name, which nobody in the two Chia mansions has yet had a chance to learn. And as if that were not puzzling enough, the chapter closes with a couplet in which the speaker's identity, the import of its rhetorical questions and the correct orthography of a crucial word are all unclear. 'Ibid., p. 75. '2HLM, I, 71.

'5HLM, I, 90.</page><page sequence="7">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 29 Readers have been quick to seize on these difficulties and bring them back to conclusions akin to those of the "repression and displacement" model we used to organize the contradictions surrounding K'e-ch'ing's death. To begin with, there is a scandal: Ch'in K'e-ch'ing is undeniably responsible, in one way or another, for Pao-yii's sexual initiation-even if only indirectly, through the fragrance of her room, the associations of her objets d'art and the irregularity of Pao-yii being asleep in her bed. By themselves, these details might be enough to precipitate erotic dreams (or to be more exact, fantasies represented and imaginatively fulfilled by an erotic dream) in an inquisitive, suggestible young boy. The hint that K'e-ch'ing sent her attendants away before Pao-yii was able to sink into the Realm of Vacuous Illusion would seem to favor this interpretation, even if any suspicions that might be raised thereby are later undermined by the framing of the whole vision within a few seconds of normal waking time. (The contradiction could always be explained as a rhetorical defense against the scandal of a direct statement.) Wu Shih-ch'ang emends 4X to ~[1 in the summarizing couplet and translates: A mystic dream-with whom did he come hither? She of all lovers from time immemorial-I alone knew who she was. The couplet's function, according to Wu, is to fill us in on "facts...which have been deliberately glossed over." "The couplet reveals that it was Ch'in K'e-ch'ing (the ch'ing-jen) who first gave Pao-yiu the forbidden fruit although in the story the author deliberately kept Ch'in K'e-ch'ing away while Pao-yii was taking a nap in her room."''6 If Wu is right, this example brings a crucial modification to the "censorship" model for the text's production. Nowhere is it suggested that the facts were disguised in order to satisfy a reader. Chih-yen-chai has been internalized by the author, who has now assumed his functions as chief censor. It makes sense to read i1l ("to know") in place of ~i ("to lose one's senses"), although the case for i is not necessarily hopeless. But regardless of whether we decide in favor of "I alone know [who she was]" or "I alone suffer this madness," either way we are stuck with the problem of assigning these lines a reference. There we might vacillate between making them stand for the thoughts of a character in the novel (presumably Pao-yii), the narrator (otherwise such an unconcerned presence), Ts'ao Hsiieh-ch'in himself (as if it were a confession or a quotation from another poem of his), or finally the impersonality of a lyric voice breaking in, as often happens with Chinese prose genres, on the narrative. Wu's solution is an elegant one, and the text, far from ruling it out, encourages it up to a certain point. But there is a good deal else that ought to make us think twice before taking Wu's interpretation of the couplet as a clue containing the meaning of the whole episode and permitting us to identify K'e-ch'ing with Pao-yii's-or even with Ts'ao Hsiieh-ch'in's - sexual initiator. Ch'in K'e-ch'ing leads Pao-yii into the allegorical vision and back out the other side-but nothing tells us that she is the same person at both ends. Pao-yti's supraterrestrial lover is named not only K'e-ch'ing ("Endearing") but also Chien-mei 'F , "Combined Beauties." The second name designates her as the fulfillment of another wish: she has "a freshness and charm that recalled Pao-ch'ai's and an elegant slimness like Tai-yii's" '6Wu Shih-ch'ang, On the Red Chamber Dream (Oxford University Press, 1961; henceforth shortened to "Wu" in page references), p. 27.</page><page sequence="8">30 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) At~~ , ) , ?fs-Q . ; El- B , IJ ~V/ll% t .17 So Chien-mei as a fantasy prefigures, or as a wish substitutes for, Pao-yii's future objects of amorous attention, the mutually exclusive Pao-ch'ai and Tai-yii. Or are the two beauties (mei-jen A ) who dominate the rest of the novel just a repetition of Chien-mei, that is, of Ch'in K'e-ch'ing, so that Pao-yii's later relation to them will have to be interpreted, like this dream, as a substitutive fiction about two girls who are loved (or created) as replacements for the original initiator whose "real name" had to be kept a secret? Pao-yii's attachment to his cousins would then have to be characterized as a kind of transference, a passion originating in the wish to repeat a unrepeatable first experience-an experience which may only have occurred in fantasy. In this way the first explanation we suggested ("Chien-mei prefigures Tai and Ch'ai") would have to be understood as a somewhat deluded version of the second explanation (Chien-mei stands for Ch'in K'e-ch'ing"), the point of the name-substitution being to disguise the originally incestuous wishes of the second explanation and so slip this bit of wish-fulfillment past the wary dream-censors. "A dream about Chien-mei," then, is a highly ambiguous event. Matters are not made any more straightforward when we next consider another reading of the name "Chien-mei." As a little crossword-puzzle analysis will demonstrate, Pao-ch'ai's and Tai-yti's two names combine to form Pao-yii's name in exactly the kind of unreal synthesis that the dream is based on. If "Chien-mei" means "two beauties combined," then Pao-yti's opposite number in the dream is simply himself, or himself in mirror-image. If this is so, then the rest of the novel including Tai-yti's death and Pao-yti's marriage to Pao-ch'ai will have to be read ironically in light of this original self-love. This also confirms the narrator's inability to do what he had promised to do in the beginning of the chapter, to put aside Pao-ch'ai and devote himself to Tai-yti. In a sense the two girls are the same "person," the same substitutive projection. But a projection of what? There are only two people in this scene, only two figures, that is, who function as irreducible givens: K'e-ch'ing and Pao-yui. They are the two "primitive" or "literal" terms out of which the dream engenders its crowd of tropes, projections and supplementary selves. But why should the fantasies reduce to two equally defensible (and unanalysable) prime terms instead of one, and why is it that this scene of sexual initiation allows itself to be read both as an incestuous fantasy and as a narcissistic one? It may be a sign of the novel's trickiness that a scene that, in Wu Shih-ch'ang's hands, could be read as a moment of maximum confessional "outwardness" coincides with a maximum thematic "inwardness" (the alternatives of inbreeding and narcissism). This is the work of displacement, to be sure, but deciding what is being displaced into what and to what end is not so easily done. "Displacement" applies not just to this sexually loaded scene but to the novel's whole mimetic texture. It is particularly evident in the very aspect of its fictional technique which has always lent support to the reading of it as thinly veiled autobiography 17HLM, I, 89-90. The implications of this doublet are brought out in Andrew Plaks' book (previously cited), pp. 61-69.

The book's author is represented as longing to build a monument to the brilliant girls who graced his youth, but when the book finally gets written these girls, along with so many other characters, seem to have dissolved into tropes of a solipsistic projection having Pao-yii as its focus. For those of us who cannot benefit from Chih-yen-chai's hindsight the characters of the novel seem not to exist individually but as functions of one another, as counters in an elaborate logic of substi- tutions. A logic more akin to algebra than to history or to narrative in the usual sense generates effects that have all the appearance of history, much as "screen memories" generate "events" out of obsessional symbolism and punning. If it could be done without taking us too far afield, this would be the place to settle down to a careful review of the ways in which tropological substitution creates character in the Hung-lou-meng. Andrew Plaks' brief survey of the question'8 touches on the most memorable examples. Pao-yti's many alter egos form a category of their own, notable for its catholicity. Pao-yii's fluid identity can find itself reflected equally well in male or female form (compare the mutual astonishment and self-deprecation when Pao-yii first meets Ch'in Chung to the first encounter with Lin Tai-yti), in the heroes of romance novels or even in a rock. But Pao-yii's impressionable sensibilities apart, the permutation of different variables in a defined "place" is also, as in algebra, a way to solve problems and fill vacancies. In the course of the novel several women fortuitously enter the "empty place" of Pao-yii's future wife, as if to try it on for size (in their own names or in another's: Ch'ing-wen's intimacy with Pao-yii, sternly discouraged by Pao-yii's mother, only reflects a possible match with Tai-yii). This scheme can foster mistakes both ludicrous and foreboding, as when Hsi-jen receives the declaration of passion meant for Tai-yii-a mischance compounded by the irony that Hsi-jen's substitutive equivalences have always been to Pao-ch'ai, never to Tai-yii; so by making two errors in one the lunatic Pao-yui has anticipated the truth and foretold the crisis of the novel's second half. Occurring again and again, these mistakes come to have an odd regularity. It is as if the thought of character or individuality were, by its very nature, predetermined to mislead; as if one could not possibly help getting it wrong. In this connection, the narrative passage that floated indecisively between Pao-ch'ai and Tai-yii looks less like the exception than the rule. Our problem of a moment ago - who or what is Chien-mei? - is at bottom a version of Pao-yti's own problem. The fact that in the dream she may stand for any of several people-K'e-ch'ing, Tai-yii and Pao-ch'ai, or even Pao-yii himself-holds true for the figures of the "waking" part of the story too; so if illusoriness is the criterion, Chien-mei is hardly more of a fantasy, or any less real, than they are. The "tragic failure in vision" Pao-yui shares with other characters, the "block in perception [which,] rather than a failure of action or a weakness of will. . . gives rise to the tragic situation,"'9 is super- ficially a mistake, a failure to address the right person, but at the bottom an inability to master the rules of substitution that construct character. For the participants in the story, closed up in its narrative like goldfish in a fishbowl, that might well be a superhuman kind of knowledge; but it is not strictly necessary to thumb the celestial Registers or consult the K'ung-k'ung Tao-jen _- Ah for it. Pao-yii might, for example, have taken a closer look at the decorations of K'e-ch'ing's '8SPlaks, op. cit., pp. 70-71. 19Ibid., pp. 78, 207.</page><page sequence="10">32 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) room before falling asleep. The picture he likes so much, T'ang Yin's "Spring Slumber Among Flowering Crab-Apples" $ 14i0 , depicts, before the fact, the nap Pao-yii is about to take (in plum-blossom time, it is true, and not crab-apple season, but this only underscores that the appropriateness of ch'un # may be elsewhere). Hung on either side of it are lines that seem to comment obliquely on the beholder's state: "The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream; the fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents."20' The couplet evokes a sensory illusion (, , , ) and then explains it, debunks it even, as the product of purely physical stimuli ( 1i~ , M Fi ). Its poetic strength-the evocative force that caught both Pao-yii's and Chih-yen's attention-lies in its being able to call up the illusion so convincingly that we can read it and be drawn into it without realizing how thoroughly it has been demystified. (Much the same could be said for the illusion of character in the novel-wholly effective despite the materials provided for its decon- struction). Both couplet and painting set up an illusion and at the same time declare it to be an illusion, which does not stop anyone from being taken in. The most troubling detail of all, however, is the colophon which identifies the scroll as the work of one Ch'in T'ai-hsti, a name whose verbal associations plainly contain the seeds of a dream about Ch'in K'e-ch'ing and an illusory realm of the "Immense Void." What if the whole dream-vision were the product of an unconscious pun joined to a repressed fantasy, and instead of giving us entry to a pure realm of the spirit, a "castle in the air," merely sent us back to words and phrases?21 If such is the ultimate origin of allthe novel's real and unreal events, then the book will have to be read as a witty parable on the excesses of imagination. (Our imaginations commit the same excesses as Pao-yti's.) And indeed this seemingly destructive possibility -destructive of our "suspension of disbelief'-is written out at length and hung it in front of our noses like the teasing verses Pao-yui fails to understand. Ch'in K'e-ch'ing's gorgeously decorated room seems to have little to do with an "Illusory Realm of the Immense Void." But no matter how intoxicating and immediately seductive its fragrance, the room is full of objects that we ought to examine a little more carefully before swooning away. In it are Wu Tse-t'ien's prized mirror, the golden tray danced on by Yen Fei, the fruit An Lu-shan aimed at Yang Kuei-fei, Princess Shou-ch'ang's bed hung with Princess T'ung-ch'ang's curtains, capped with the headrest made famous by Hsi-hsiang-chi and overspread with a quilt washed, once upon a time, by the laundress- become-imperial-consort Hsi Shih. Now if we were alarmed by the thought that the dream's mystical-erotic vision might decompose into unconscious wishes, or if it seemed simpler to explain it as a not particularly perverse desire to climb into a beautiful painting, the roster of these exquisite objects, some possibly real and others surely fictional, will add to the complexity of either answer. K'e-ch'ing's bedroom is really a library; it evokes love (in every sense of the words) by piling together topoi of the romance tradition. So-to come back to Wu Shih-ch'ang's reading-the passage might 20Hawkes, tr., op. cit., I, 127. 21The proverb says: tH P-~i', , fIk {f4?fiJ . Karl S. Y. Kao has also observed a device which he calls "literalization of figures" in the late-Ming novel Hsi-yu pu; see his "A Tower of Myriad Mirrors," forthcoming in a new series of Wen-lin.</page><page sequence="11">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 33 be summed up as saying in an elaborate way that it was literature, and not a compromised female relative, that "gave Pao-yti the forbidden fruit." Could this too be the work of the novel's hidden censor, once again striving to suppress a family scandal with a baroquely elaborate and prolonged psychic defense? The passage would then be a slightly over-emphatic attempt to throw us off the trail, and its connoisseur scholarship only a way of stacking evidence in favor of the conclusion that K'e-ch'ing is a literary construct whose origins are in fiction, not in life. An interpretation like Wu Shih-ch'ang's assumed that the text had to be read like a coded record of suppressed realities. But the trouble with this way of "restoring the origins" (jf) of the text is that its terminology of origin and result may prove question-begging, especially when, as now, it has to judge the value of solutions that may not be reducible to a temporal pattern at all. The choice here is between two kinds of interpretation, one of which would assimilate the central figure of Ch'in K'e-ch'ing to a remembered person or experience, and the other of which would make her the embodiment of an intertext (e.g. "the romance tradition"). The "truth" (or "master") of one is the "fiction" (or "servant") of the other. A reader of the biographical school would see nothing but an elaborate alibi in the literary scaffolding surrounding the figure of K'e-ch'ing, while to a reader bent on rhetorical analysis that very scaffolding would express the truth of the literary character as an imaginative construction. A repression-bound and alibi-creating consciousness can serve as a possible mediator only if we accept the category of the person as a semantic prime, an indissoluble factor, and assert that texts come from persons rather than the other way round. But is this a suitable assumption, and is the Hung-lou-meng really a humanistic book, in that sense? 4. Personhood and Reading Asking that question will mean taking a step out of the empirical. Outside of literature, language rarely if ever appears unconnected with human beings-not even in the atmosphere of the consulting-room, where human will is certainly not paramount. But in this novel human being, or being human, is something contingent - and contingent to reading, of all things. Readings that try, in a spirit of J , to return the book to a human origin therefore have to disregard or take in a reductive sense what it says, directly and obviously, about interpretation. The book's critique of humanistic or human-centered readings will have to be developed step by step. First of all, its hero's human existence is derived from a linguistic error, a wrong interpretation. From the moment the useless, magical Stone chances to hear two strange monks discussing the attractions of the human world it is no longer the same: "As it heard this, the Stone secretly felt a wish to learn more... Its mouth began to spit out human words and it addressed the two monks: 'Hearing the two of you tell about that splendid, brilliant human world I couldn't help wanting to see it for myself...' "22 NOt even an advance summary of everything the Stone is fated to learn in the world below is enough to dissuade it from this longing: "how could [the stone] ever understand such words?" It insists on seeing for itself. The monks' reply characterizes them as able to grasp the whole story of which the Stone's impetuosity is only a part (and indeed a predictable moment). In the hallowed language 22HLM, I, 2.</page><page sequence="12">34 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) of coordinate opposition they concede: Wt   J, , M fW - 't-h tf . t Hllt ... "Surely a matter of calm which, reaching its extreme, generates desire; of existence springing out of nothingness. Well, in that case . . ." This awakening begins one of many cycles. The Stone's first encounter with human language brings no illumination, it only commits it to acting out an illusion. Vicarious experiences mediated by words cause the Stone, like a bad interpreter, to forget its original stoniness and identify itself with the object of its interpretation. As soon as its propensity to longing, its YLL' , has been moved, the inanimate stone begins to "spit out human words" and presently, as a further step towards humanization, "changes shape23 and enters the mortal world" (?-Jf0 h t: ) as Chia Pao-yui. The Stone in human form shows the same, easily excitable imagination as before. As everyone knows, Pao-yti's instruction by the fairy Ching-huan in chapter 5 utterly fails to teach him the intended lessons. The commonsense reason for this is that he is still too young to understand what he is being told - that Ching-huan's teaching comes too early; but a more careful reading shows that it actually comes too late, when Pao-yui is already past saving. The signboards hanging over the bureaux of Ching-huan's administrative complex- i ,;J ("Department of Passionate Folly") and the like-make him ponder: "So that's how it is. Only I don't know what words like 'eternal passion' or 'romantic debts' mean. From now on I had better try to find out." ( fT f lt . s-;-lM ? I?'_ , J? rJi ]t , I2_ , Jfl~I~PJ %'-'il .) Understanding very little of it, he finds the vocabulary of passion new and attractive. Vaguely felt sym- pathy fills up the gaps in his knowledge: he reads and automatically heaves a sigh, (;- i ygf} . One is reminded of the effects of premature novel-reading on Rousseau: "En peu de temps j'acquis, par cette dangereuse m6thode...une intelligence unique h mon age sur les passions. Je n'avais aucune id6e des choses, que tous les sentiments m'6taient connus."24 The contagious side-effects of reading-what Rend Girard has called the stimulation of mimetic desire25-are so immediate in Pao-yti that when, some pages later, he answers Ching-huan's accusations of lustfulness with the plea that he is too young and ignorant to know even the meaning of the word, the argument fails to persuade her. One suspects that actual knowledge may have little to do with it. So far, of course, the mechanics of carnal desire are a mystery to Pao-yti, and Ching-huan quite rightly restricts her charge to one of "mental lust" ( iYf). This does not exactly soften the sentence. Ching-huan dismisses ordinary sensuality. Instead of being awakened by sight, smell, touch and so forth, Pao-yii's awful vice, a matter of fantasized regrets and desires without an object, is excited by hearing about other people's passions. Like Adam's and Eve's, Pao-yii's error is a pedagogical exercise that went wrong. The difference between error and illumination is represented in chapter 5 as a difference between styles of reading. Parallel to the erroneous identification of self and other in Pao-yii's sympathetic reading of the signboards (or the stone's of the monks' conversation) is Pao-yii's utter failure to get any content from the prophetic books put in his hands by Ching-huan. He flicks through the registers, glassy-eyed, unable or unwilling to 230r "takes on an imagined shape," playing on the senses of RJ. 24Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Confessions, book I, in Oeuvres Completes, I (Paris: Gallimard-Pl6iade, 1959), p. 8. 25Ren6 Girard, Mensonge romantique et vdritd romanesque (Paris: Grasset, 1961; Eng. trans.

"What he read baffled him and he threw it aside. . . He still made no sense of it, and so pushed it away again... Taking yet another look, he still found it impenetrable.. but just as he was about to abandon it for the last time he somehow couldn't, and kept reading." d&lt;, j, ~ j ).26 Ching-huan's attempts to enliven the presentation with the "Hung-lou-meng" song cycle bore him to tears, and at last, exasperated, she casts him into the predicted danger itself. Chien-mei proves not only compliant but also, with her double identity as self-projection and incestuous other, is the ideal companion for someone devoted, like Pao-yii, to the vicarious, self-seeking tropes of novel-reading. The project of educating Pao-yti has failed or, worse than failed, backfired: what ought to have been an unmasking of illusions only hastens his complete acceptance of the illusions and ends with their taking a practical form in the arms of an impossible fantasized lover. These acts of reading and interpretation look forward to many more. To restrict ourselves for the moment to Pao-yti's adventures with books, these tend to go in one of two ways. Pao-yui as reader either repeats the Stone's mimetic identification with the text (as when his admiration for the Hsi-hsiang-chi leads him to imagine himself and Tai-yti in the leading roles, and as a result offend her with an ill-chosen allusion) or fails to see the import of the text, much as he had failed to understand Ching-huan's prophecies. Moreover, as an interpreter the human Pao-yui has at least one vice the Stone lacked. While the Stone's error lay in an uncritical submission to the text, which it then allowed to dictate its behavior and its very essence, Pao-yti's tendency is to treat texts as mere extensions of himself, commentaries on his feelings of the moment. Though this willful attitude seems poles apart from the Stone's gullibility, both forms of misreading lead to the same result, the overpowering of the reader by the book. Only with the willful style of misreading, this overpowering, rather than becoming immediately apparent in words and deeds, shows up only in the ironic confrontation of a text and a commentary that purports, but evidently fails, to interpret it. In chapter 21 Pao-yti, angry and a little drunk, opens the Chuang-tzu to a chapter that he feels perfectly mirrors his situation. "He read thus far and felt a tremendous inspiration. He could not help reaching for his pen... "27 What he then composes is a kind of lyrical parody, rewriting the old philosopher's satire into a self-pitying rant against the girls who make him so miserable. Only a giant misunderstanding could justify this. The hyperbolic mode of Chuang-tzu's irony lay in its substituting the mote for the beam: its satire of misunderstanding in the beholder was phrased as a denunciation of the things beheld. Pao-yti's reading of this is hardly magnanimous (ta-kuan hR ). It exemplifies, rather, the self-centeredness originally damned by the passage it tries to co-opt. Here at least, in the face-off of text and interpretation the text still gets the last word. This form of interpretative irony is familiar from other places in the Hung-lou-meng -one example in small compass being the couplet surrounding K'e-ch'ing's "Spring Sleep" painting. Somewhat more obvious, but nonetheless structurally identical, are the ironies of the episode about Chia Jui and the magic mirror in chapter 12. As one of 26HLM, I, 77-78. 27/bid., I, 293.</page><page sequence="14">36 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) the novel's alternate titles, taken from this episode, reminds us, "mirror" in Chinese book titles (e.g. (j jA , "Comprehensive Mirror of Government"; Ai tE&amp;W$ , "A Precious Mirror of the Demi-Monde") designates a particular kind of reading-in-writing: the study of examples from the past in order to gain instruction for the present. Chia Jui's mirror, like an ambiguous oracle, has two faces. One bearing a death's head and one bearing the image of his heart's desire, they recall Ching-huan's miscalculated attempt to teach Pao-yii to see the emptiness (k'ung 9) in worldly desires (se f ). By keeping his eyes fixed, despite instructions to the contrary, on the alluring side, Chia Jui finally accomplishes exactly what he had refused to acknowledge the representa- tion of on the disenchanting side: he dies.28 The moral for readers is clear. One "reading" of a two-faced object like Chia Jui's mirror is stronger than the other, with the weaker reading simply carrying out the implications of the stronger one. Pao-yui likewise discovers this law on his second visit to the Realm of Illusion. Then he finally manages to guess what the Registers are about, but in chapter 116 it is already too late for this knowledge to do him much good; most of the predictions have already come true. Because the difference between correct and incorrect readings is not just a matter of values but is a struggle confirmed by fact-the true reading is the one that finally comes true-the novel's model of reading can therefore be stated as a narrative form. The model contains three stages: first a misunderstanding of an ambiguous text; then an attempt to apply the false knowledge gained by that misinterpretation, while on the other hand the true interpretation works its way into fact; and finally a rediscovery of the formerly neglected interpretation, which solves the problem posed at the beginning. Readers of the Hung-lou-meng will recognize in this description the salient features of a game much enjoyed by the Chia family: guessing riddles. Rhetorically speaking, riddles combine dramatic and interpretive irony through a manipulation of logical time. A riddle names something, but in a way that departs from the ordinary way of naming and invites confusion; it suggests several interpretations, some of which are bound to be wrong. Someone who has been asked a riddle and does not know how to answer it wavers between imaginary alternatives, unable to jump the gap between words and things. But a riddle is effective for only so long as it misleads: as soon as the right word has been called out, it collapses in a flash of light. "A terrifying explosion rocks the earth; turn your head and it has already melted into ash."29 Asking and answering a riddle takes time, during which possible solutions are tried out, refined or rejected, but an already solved riddle is something like a tautology, merely two names for the same thing-like Hesperus and Phosphorus.30 So it is with the novel's plot, a vast identical proposition that takes time to be revealed as such. From the point of view that is ours at the end of the book, its narrative appearance, its accumulation of experiences, the slow maturation of its characters are really disguises for an originally ambiguous act of naming. Critics have often remarked on the "static" quality of the novel's plot. Apart from the perfectly sensible argument that a slow pace is one of the conventions of the Chinese novel, this static quality could also be imputed to the plotting, across time, of a logical structure not temporal in its essence. 28Chih-yen-chai accordingly makes this episode an allegory of the novel's fate in the hands of its future readers: see Yii P'ing-po, p. 156. 29HLM, I, 313. 30See Saul A. Kripke, "Naming and Necessity" (in: Davidson and Harman, eds., Semantics of Natural Language [Dordrecht and Boston: Reidel, 1972]), pp. 253-355.</page><page sequence="15">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 37 A solved riddle leaves one with a bitter wisdom: that the time spent establishing that A is A was spent under a series of illusions, and that the idea that that time corresponded to a series of distinct logical operations has been an illusion too. It is not surprising if so many of the Hung-lou-meng's riddles look forward to their death- the moment when interpretation resolves into tautology. But their structure is not limited to actual riddles. Nothing is more frequent throughout the book than cases of delayed understanding. Dropped hints like place names, personal names or exaggerated remarks that unexpectedly come true (for example Pao-yii's threat to become a monk, or the name "Hsiao-hsiang Kuan" Mj4~ j given to Tai-yii's future house long before anyone suspects that the name's associations with plant life, tears and bereavement may take a literal turn) are near-riddles that go uninterpreted until it is too late-that is, until they have come true. The striking exception, Chia Cheng's prescience in chapter 22, makes one want to revise one's opinion of that usually stiff and unsympathetic character.31 Are these omens evidence of a superstitious, fatalistic "feudal mentality" on the author's part?32 Fairness would seem to demand we look at the book as a whole before taking such a literalistic position. Riddles are contagious, at least in Chinese: the linguistic structure called mi M (riddle) is a near-homonym to the word for the mental state it induces, mi IA (confusion). Someone guessing a riddle wavers between several solutions and is prone to make sudden misidentifications, in a state of incomplete understanding much like Pao-yti's bewildered efforts to make sense of the romantic vocabulary. Of course a general inability to match words to things, names to persons, marks Pao-yti's struggle with the whole puzzling topic of "passion" (ch'ing ). When Ching-huan's mission to shake him out of the "circle of confusion" (mi-jen ch'ian-tzu ,Z gj f ) fails, he sets out on a straight course for the "Slough of Error" (mi-chin A,); on awakening from the lesson he is still "dazed and confused," mi-mi huo-huo E ,, . Most of the novel's plot takes place in that atmosphere of confusion. In light of its identical endpoints-the last chapter a return to the first-it could be compared to a giant mi . Pao-yti's whole (human) existence arises from a misreading (the Stone's misidentifi- cation with humanity) and lasts only so long as does the state of confusion brought on by the riddle of his inadequately interpreted name. Signs of the unsolved mystery are everywhere. From chapter 1 onwards we get intermittent news of the Chen 9) family of Nanking and its eccentric son, also named Pao-yti. But the interplay set up then between Chia Pao-yti and Chen Pao-yti (punning names that connote respectively "false precious jade" and "true precious jade") mainly directs our attention back to the polarity already existing between Chia Pao-yti and the other "pao-yii" most intimately connected top him, the magical stone around his neck. With his ambiguous identity Chia Pao-yti "differs from himself" as much as he resembles the other human Pao-yti. He is a walking riddle. The words pao-ya Z$ , whenever they are spoken, evoke something between anthropomorphism and fetish (without here going into the question of connotative metaphor, e.g. of taking them as shorthand for "the Chia family's precious heir" or the like). Which of the two-the person or the talisman-is the "true" or "original" one and which is a disguise or a pun for the other? The stone's disappearance puts the riddle 31HLM, I, 315. The last pages of this chapter are incomplete in the Chih-yen-chai family of manuscripts. 32As suggested by Wang Hsiieh-t'ai E- in "Tui-pei-t'u, t'u ch'ien, Hung-lou-meng." gg_ , f]j , IT .o-. Hung-lou-meng yen-chiu chi-k'an, no. 5 (1980), pp. 393-398.</page><page sequence="16">38 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) to a kind of test: which of the two can get along without the other? Which is the proprietor and which the property? Without his stone the boy Pao-yui is reduced to a gawking automaton, so the jade must be the "true Pao-yii" and the boy only a metaphorical alias. Still, for the characters in the novel, seeing things from a human point of view, the boy's link to the jade remains indefinable: separable and different from him, and yet, as Wang fu-jen exclaims in chapter 116, as much a part of him as life itself.33 In the last chapter (Kao E's work) the hermit Chen Shih-yin, charged with tying up all the complicated threads of the now completed story, proposes the theory that the magic jade had somehow been caused to "leave this terrestrial plane" by the separation of Pao-ch'ai and Tai-yii (i.e., by the Hsileh family's move to quarters of their own in chapter 76). This is passably obscure, and reads as if the small society of the Ta-Kuan Yiian were a chemical substance made up of elements volatile in themselves, but stable in their compound form. Nonetheless, a key to Chen's explanation can be found if we remember that the two most important errors in the novel, the Stone's vicarious entry into humanity and Pao-yti's vicarious entry into romance, are structurally similar and may be expected to lead to similar crises. The doublet of "jade" and "boy" in Pao-yii can keep up an appearance of unity only so long as the corresponding composite of Tai and Ch'ai - who together make up "Chien-mei" - does. When that fantasy-projection falls apart, as it must, into two different people between whom one must choose, it announces the collapse of the equally improbably synthesis on which it was patterned, Pao-yii's "self" or his ability to be both boy and stone at the same time. Many of the intrigues surrounding the lost jade in the last third of the novel frankly jibe with Ts'ao's original intentions, as recorded in Chih-yen-chai's notes.34 The slippery jade was apparently supposed to be "stolen by mistake" (gSg) and later found by Wang Hsi-feng while sweeping the snow on the steps of Pao-yti's old quarters ( Er, W~ A ). There is another, possibly related, story about "Chen Pao-yui sending a jade" (i t ~, ).35 "Sweeping snow" alludes to Hsi-feng's disgrace or refers to a time when the whole family has had to move into the Ta-Kuan Yiian. Who "stole the jade" and how this happened "by mistake" are less clear. There is surely no shortage of suspects in the Chia clan, with motives ranging between jealousy, greed, revenge and black magic. If the (non-magical) jade sent as a gift by Chen Pao-yui were somehow to be mistaken for the "genuine precious jade," one can imagine the consequences- including perhaps a humiliating come-uppance for the person who "stole the wrong jade" (if this is the meaning of S ). Another "false precious jade" that drops out of Kao's sequel is the replica offered Pao-yii by the Pei-ching Chiin-wang as a token of friendship. Rather than try to reconstruct this labyrinth Kao has, perhaps wisely, worked up a different story that by and large carries out the implications of the "riddle" structure. It shows us a thoroughly baffled Pao-yti confronting the possibility that he, the human Pao-yii, derives from an error, that "boy" is in fact the fictional term of the metaphorical pair "boy - jade." By discovering the illusion in his assumed humanity, he is led to correct the misreading that had brought him to incarnation on earth in the first place, 33HLM, III, 1588. 340nce again, Wu Shih-ch'ang (169-184, 267-321 and passim) provides a copious and accessible review of the evidence. 35Yii P'ing-po, pp. 136, 324, 241. Wu's translation of the last ("returned by Chen Pao-yii," op. cit., p. 192) is too specific.</page><page sequence="17">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 39 or in other words to undo the metaphorical rapport between the "proper noun" "Pao-yii" and the "common noun" "pao-yii." The illness caused by losing the jade then vanishes. It is as if the jade's loss were only a consequence of thinking of the jade as an accessory to its wearer, something that could be lost or found, put on or taken off. The outcome of the "test" which separated them is to make it impossible to separate the owner from the object, the symbol from the thing symbolized. Its solution can be said to collapse a metaphor-an assertion of relation, of likeness within difference-into an identity. This reversal-a twist which reverses the Stone's original error-also takes place through an act of reading. Kao E's handling of this crucial episode does not quite deform it beyond recognition. When the strange monk brings back the missing jade for a reward, Pao-yii, recognizing it, is able to make the paradoxical announcement (paradoxical for someone who has not stirred from his bed for twenty or more chapters) to his father: "Pao-yii's back" Y 1K  . Chia Cheng gives this strange sentence a common-sense interpretation as meaning that "Pao-yii's health has returned," TI kB:Ef 4 J .36 Now-in one of Kao's many slipshod transitions-suddenly remembering his beloved Tai-yii, Pao-yii sinks into a swoon and revisits the Land of Illusion. Almost everything has changed since his first visit. No longer the guardian's specially chosen pupil, he has to break into the archives to have a second look at the magic register-books, and the motives ascribed him this time are piquantly low-mimetic: "I think I'll copy this down and become a kind of prophet; save myself a lot of useless worrying besides."37 Only the text is the same. The clue that finally sparks his perceptive reading is appro- priately enough a proper name (that of one of his maids,  , ) rendered as a rebus-picture of things-common nouns (it, , with the A left in suspense). And accordingly, when familiar characters from his earthly life appear they no longer answer to their old names or recognize him: another variation on the "people departed, things remain"  jj A topos.38 They chase him away and then call him back under a strange new name corresponding to his pre-incarnate self. The Russian formalists would diagnose Pao-yii's bewilderment as a case of ostranenie, or "defamiliarization"; the old rhetoricians would say that the episode is constructed as an allegory, in which names "say one thing and mean another." Fictional characters have the questionable privilege of entering into tropes as we enter a landscape or a climate. (And need it be repeated that the whole "realm" owes its origin to an imaginatively embroidered fact of language - the signature on the "Spring Slumber" scroll?) It is not just the exotic language of this new, allegorical country or the alien quality familiar things take on there that disorients the dreaming Pao-yui. As an effect of his dehumanizing reading he, too, undergoes a change of rhetorical status. What used to be merely figurative about him ("Precious Jade" taken as a decorative and suitable name to give a much doted-on child) is now literally and exclusively true. The relatives assembled around Pao-yii's bed find his way of talking after this vision equally disturbing. His dialogue with the monk only makes sense in light of a metaphorical reversal which none of them have experienced. They have only the habitual sense of words to go by. But even with superior knowledge like ours it is impossible to say whether a sentence like Pao-yii's "Well then, I'll give the jade back to you" 36HLM, III, 1580. 371bid., III, 1583. 38Perhaps more aptly: Y , t~' .</page><page sequence="18">40 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) 1ldt, is to be understood as a bargaining ploy, a coded way of setting a rendez-vous with the monk or a plain factual engagement, made by the stone, to return to its original patch of ground. Pao-yi himself is presumably past these indecisions. For him the riddle has already dissolved into an identity-proposition like the one Chen Shih-yin propounds at the end of the book: "Pao-yii is none other than a pao-yai [precious stone]... And thereupon his predetermined fate was accomplished, form and matter condensed into one." i:t, YtF ". r. . iltMs k~ , W5 - .39 It would be an over- statement to call this a metaphor. Pao-yii's life-story has shrunk to the interval between two ways (phonetically indistinguishable ones, to be sure) of naming a stone.40 So the Dream of the Red Chamber is the Bildungsroman of the boy who discovered he was a trope. This knowledge has no phenomenal (i.e. other than figural) counterpart, and so raises a host of rhetorical and ideological problems. When the hero deconstructs himself and disappears, becoming a thing neither living nor dead, we readers too are left with an "impression of felt life" on our hands that greatly exceeds its meaning. Every discussion of the novel has had to find an answer to this puzzle: how to interpret Pao-yti's career in a way that will still have a meaning for the (inevitably human) reader. If the action of the major subplot involving the jade is essentially a hesitation, an indecision, about how to describe the relation between Pao-yi and his stone, it is no wonder that we readers find ourselves and our reactions woven into the plot alongside its fictional characters. One of the book's earliest readers observed that the Hung-lou-meng works towards baffling resolutions.41 As is true of many novels of apprenticeship, the book's ending retrospectively transforms its beginning. But this ending is hardly a Proustian triumph of memory over time. It is not even a Flaubertian ending whereby, allowing for the endemic irony of the process, "the moment of failure is the moment of value; the comprehending and experiencing of life's refusals is the source from which the fullness of life seems to flow."42 Neither "memory" nor "experiencing" pad this ending's strangeness. When the life-story is revealed to have been a metaphor, all the tentative interpretations summoned thus far to give the story coherence are disrupted; hierarchies of literal and figural meaning are reversed. Taken literally, the conclusion means that there has been no Bildungsroman at all. The end annuls the process that brought it about. Kao E's last word on Pao-yii's life history needs to be scrutinized here, as it clearly backs off from the implications of an autobiography with no subject. There the action of the last few chapters is paraphrased as: "An unearthly book tells an unearthly tale: two different men become a single man." ( XY J&amp;4jfEg4- , g f--  .)43 Kao's formula tries, but somehow fails to bring the novel's ending to rest. To be sure, a certain imaginative extension of the word "man" is required to justify describing Pao-yti and his stone as "two [different] men," but to cap the story with the reuniting of man and stone "into a single man" must be either a slip of the pen or the fruit of a 39HLM, III, 1644. 40For all its difference from metaphor or narrative presentation, tautology is no semantic vacuum. The Russian Formalist critics found in repetition and tautology one of the ways in which language calls attention to itself and to its "device"-character.

What does the word "man" (jen ) in Kao's nutshell summary represent? Or better, what does it replace? To ask this question is, of course, to raise in reduced form the problem of evaluating Kao E's contribution to the novel. Kao's ending has long been attacked as a piece of "dog's fur" stitched onto Ts'ao's "sable," but one can sympathize with Kao: even granting him the best of intentions, he could not always be expected to match the imagination of an author whose "tricky pen" is constantly remarked on by the one reader who ought to have known him best. Perhaps the best judgment on Kao's work is the intermittent flow over the years of alternate endings, tailpieces, supplements-bibliographic proof that while not everyone is satisfied with his conclusion, no other sequel has yet enjoyed so long a life. Wu Shih-ch'ang goes over a standard list of Kao's weaknesses, some of them failures of talent and some of them differences of opinion as regards Ts'ao Hsiieh-ch'in. The attitudes that made Kao regard the difference between man and stone as inessential may be blamed for at least one of these lapses: Tai-yii's final transformation into a half-human, half-flower fairy queen. Given their market sense it is not surprising that Kao E and his publisher Ch'eng Wei-yiian should have contrived to reunite hero and heroine in the end. (Some of the recent supplements, by raising the dead or removing other obstacles, offer even rosier solutions.) But it is unfortunate that Kao and Ch'eng have had to break the few, yet very precise, laws of Ts'ao's dreamland in order to do so. Since the terrestrial and heavenly planes are presented throughout as polar forms of reality, each of which is unreal to the other, Kao's way of working around the sentimental obstacles come across as grotesque and muddled.44 This of course reduces the mytho- logical frame to a mere decoration, a "subservient" figure, and deprives it of any power to explain earthly events. A similar wish to have it all ways accounts for the worldling Pao-yii's reformation and adoption of a strictly Confucian outlook-a sudden turn of events that flies in the teeth of everything we have read up to then. Kao may have taken these steps in order to forestall censorship. Whatever the cause, the language of the last chapters shows him determined to get the upper hand in his fortuitous partnership with Ts'ao, even at the price of sabotaging it. Sometimes this urge takes the form of wholesale revision, sometimes that of digression and episodicity, and sometimes that of parody (as in the Shandyesque jokes of the metafictional epilogue). No single maneuver, probably, is as obvious as Kao's renaming the ifi.? (Illusory Realm of the Immense Void) to make it a l .iitJ (Blessed Land of Truth). The old, difficult couplet gets a coat of whitewash and in its place the new slogan runs: "Falsity departs, truth comes and truth overcomes falsity. Nonexistence there is indeed; but nonexistence is not existence." No dialectical mediation can reconcile the two couplets; the new one simply pushes out the old. Kao throws his authority into reinstating the true and the false as stable poles of meaning as if his happy ending depended on it. And the strategically placed couplet naturally contains a formula for reading, too: "Get rid of the fairyland decorations, 44Hua-shih Chti-jen (collected in I-su, op. cit., I, 176) observes: "For all that the Realm is a Realm of Illusion, one enters the illusion and it becomes true... One is born into the world of mortals and when one dies, one leaves it; but one leaves the immortals' realm at birth and re-enters it at death." 45HLM, III, 1582.</page><page sequence="20">42 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) read this novel as a portrayal of social rise and fall and you'll see how much more sense it makes." Although Kao could cheerfully admit to having written an "extravagant, unearthly" (!r ft, j4-) kind of story, changes like these show him startled into a defensive position by the truly extravagant aspects of Ts'ao's manuscript. We are now in a position to see what prompted the odd use of "man" instead of "stone" in Kao's concluding lines. Kao's sentimentalism (expressed in Tai-yii's double shape), his conformism (as in Pao-yii's reformation) and his anthropocentrism are all of a piece. The replacement of "stone" by "man" is an allegorizing defense against the truly allegorical dimensions of the work. Kao never took the incarnation story seriously, and so when he read that Pao-yii returned to the Ta-Huang Shan metamorphosized into a rock he took that as a mysterious way of saying something banal: that the romantic became a sensible citizen at last, put away his dreams and started performing his duties. For Kao the obvious and literal reading of the story was impossible-as impossible as the actual transformation of boys into stones or stones into boys-and that is why the contrary ending, "realistic" but justified only by allegoresis, had to be asserted so stubbornly. Kao E was almost right: he knew that the novel's riddle structure demanded that it be led back at last to its starting point, only he returned it to the wrong origin. Where the novel plainly said "stone," he ignored it and wrote "man" in its place. Is there not something peculiar-peculiarly predetermined-about the way that Kao's last word repeats the Stone's first words? Kao's "solution" repeats the initial statement of the problem. Through this repetition, the frame-story, far from being allegorized into insignificance, reasserts itself and provides a way of allegorizing Kao's ending in turn. 5. Allegory as Jeopardy .. this boundary-zone where the elements of two orders meet: their combination produces a form, not a substance Saussure, Cours de linguistique gindrale, p. 157 The point of asking whether the Hung-lou-meng had to be considered a humanistic book should now be a little clearer. Whatever it may be, it is certainly not just a humanistic book. Humanistic interpretations are necessary to it, but only as a form of misreading which the novel exploits to make its own rarefied points: it invites them in and then shows them up. So far we have been able to use our own and other readers' perplexities to discover some of the things the novel is not, as if in a game of Twenty Questions. But we have only scattered hints as to what the novel is. The deadlock between Kao E and the novel he was trying to finish is a model misunderstanding. To a reader like Kao, the self (or its analogues in a story about recognizable human selves) is reality; but unfortunately the text it fell to him to complete never misses a chance to characterize that reality as a created reality, a reification, in short an illusion. And where Kao's version works toward striking a blow for actual human values (maturity, achievement, recognition) over the fantasy-values of romance and myth injected into the story by Ch'in K'e-ch'ing and her "elder sister" Ching-huan, the novel as it seems originally to have been planned would have made the hero's life story and love affairs into a means to the realization that he is a mineral and has no business in the world of men and women anyway. The two interpretations disagree, not haphazardly but systematically and in detail.</page><page sequence="21">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 43 But in phrasing, as we just did, the difference between Kao's and Ts'ao's conceptions of the novel as a thematic, ideological conflict has the unwelcome effect of emphasizing content to the exclusion of all else. Content has its pitfalls: Kao's blanket error about Pao-yii's two identities, for instance, was caused by his unwillingness to distinguish a rhetorical problem (determining the literal and figural faces of a metaphor) from one of content and reference (reality versus fantasy, stone-boy versus boy-boy). When the mythological frame-story insists that the impossible is the literal and the realistic is the figurative, it seems to be having its joke at the expense of literalistic, content-bound interpretations like Kao's. A little more dialectical agility will be in order if we are to keep up with Ts'ao and his "tricky pen." Put together, the two readings form a single rhetorical structure. They correspond in outline, but with their values reversed, as do a photograph and its negative. What one reading emphasizes gets passed over in the other; the one accepts as literal what the other allegorizes and vice versa. The "truths" of one presentation become the "falsehoods" of the opposite reading, and so forth. Kao's compromise solutions are largely meant to forestall the choice we are left with now, which will be a choice between antithetical readings: one, the reading which we have been calling the "humanistic" one, conveniently represented by Kao E, and the other, which would surely reverse the former's pattern of emphases but about which we can say little else. We know what Kao stood for, a characteristic mid-Ch'ing strain of neo-Confucianism.46 What would the "other reading" stand for, then? Even granting that a reading opposite to Kao's would have some points of similarity to Ts'ao's own project, that still leaves a great deal undetermined. Are Ts'ao's dis- similarities to Kao the arch-Confucian enough to make him an anti-Confucian-or is he more a reformer and readjuster of a basically Confucian sensibility? (Apart from the shapeless quality of those labels, Ts'ao's lip-service to "compassionate rulers, dutiful subjects, benevolent fathers and filial sons" B J 47 can b~ij .4 can be taken in several ways.) Ts'ao's intimates had none of Kao's orthodoxy, as Chih-yen-chai's occasional abuse of minor characters in the novel as J ("rotten Confucian") shows. One wonders what words Chih-yen-chai would find to express an opinion of Kao's work. But although Kao E has served as whipping boy for generations of Hung-lou-meng devotees, there is no single text that could be designated the Anti-Kao. A glance at recent criticism, or even better at I-su's collection of old readers' notes, prefaces and occasional pieces, the Hung-lou-meng chuan, is instructive. There is seemingly no end of distinct ways of reading the novel, all of them equally determined to turn Kao's interpretation upside down: not only Buddhist readings, which of course reject the primacy given to the person in Kao's text, but also narrowly political ones which take the book as an anti-Manchu allegory, readings which find in it a broad-liberal rejection of traditional Chinese society, "class-conscious" readings of the type popularized by Chiang Ch'ing, "archetypal" readings which subordinate verisimilitude to the demands of a symbolic code, rhetorical readings and so on. So the "Kao - Anti-Kao" line will have to be reworked in keeping with all this variety: it is not a single-issue campaign. And this is just as well. For the humanistic viewpoint we saw most stubbornly maintained by Kao has many forms, often under the pens of authors who share neither Kao's psychology nor his politics, and a single center of opposition would never exhaust it. 46Noted with displeasure by Wu, pp. 252-253, 302-305. 47HLM, I, 6.</page><page sequence="22">44 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) The interesting problems encountered by readers of the Hung-lou-meng are never simply doctrinal ones - Confucianism versus Buddhism, democracy versus authoritarianism, and so on. They are, rather, the difficulties of making the text square with the reader's biases. This means that they will be expressed in decisions about figurality: decisions about what to take literally and what metaphorically. And what brings readers to this fork in the road is typically the novel's main figural device, the perplexing counterpoint of the frame story and the story inside the frame. The problem is always how, or indeed whether, to reconcile the two. Du c6td de chez Kao, then, we find allegorizations that strain probability to get a humanistic message from the book. Some readers go beyond Kao in the elegance and simplicity of their solutions: the Chieh-an Chii-shih JiS - I makes Pao-yii's stone the symbol of his hsin , or mind.48 To a reader of Ch'anist sensibilities, of course, the stone would be the absolute opposite of a "mind" and that reading would represent the height of obscurantism. Ch'en T'ui's ( Mi) interpretations exceed Kao's in another way. He enrolls the Hung-lou-meng in the service of republican and eqalitarian ideals, with results that are still poles apart from a Ch'anist or other-worldly reading. In his "Why the Hung-lou-meng Should Be Included Among the Philosophers" ( yiJE ,igg fg ) of 1914, Ch'en calls the novel the Social Contract of the East. The author's meaning is mostly expressed through the words and actions of Pao-yti. When Pao-yii is compared to the rejected stone which was not taken to repair the heavens, the meaning is rather: the world is badly governed. When the stone is discovered in a newborn child's mouth, the meaning is that humanity is stony and lifeless.49 So here, too, a judicious use of allegory maintains the story on a human level. On that level, Ch'en casts an unaccustomed light on the familiar story: "On surveying Pao-yti's life from beginning to end, one sees that he is fit to be a citizen of a republic, civil servant of a republic, legislator for a republic, even president of a republic." The naturalistic story may need to be reshaped in the interests of a thesis - Ch'en finds no way to fit Pao-yii's relations with women into his portrait of the ideal citizen, and here his commentary grows a bit forced-but it does not have to be processed through metaphorical channels. It is more or less self-explanatory. Although the points Ch'en makes would never have occurred to Kao, his interpretation resembles Kao's to the extent that it relies on a firm separation of real and unreal levels. Needless to say, this may be a short-sighted way of treating a novel which demonstrates, through one of its plots, the illusory nature of existence. For such a novel-it seems only logical to conclude-all mimesis becomes allegory and even a sentence like "The marquise went out at five" is tinged with irony. Is it licit to draw a rule now from this play of readings and counter-readings? What leads readers like Kao and Ch'en to underestimate the novel's complexity is not the fact that they approach it with an unsuitable social philosophy or a mistaken idea of the ego; nor is it just that they try to allegorize whatever they are unable to understand. Their real mistake is that they try to localize allegory, to give it a limited field of 481-su, op. cit., I, 184, 186. 49/bid., I, 269.</page><page sequence="23">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 45 applicability, instead of seeing that the special nature of this book's allegory affects it through and through. Here the allegorical dimension results from the fact that the novel invites two justifiable, largely self-consistent, mutually exclusive readings. Either reading becomes allegorical in the other's sight-a disguised or perverted copy of the truth. The Hung-lou-meng is therefore, in the strict sense of the word, an allegory. It "says one thing and means another," whateverthe "thing said" and the "thing meant" may be.50 It makes "continuous metaphor" of its interpretations, especially when they aim to go beyond its metaphors and analogies and discover their "literal" analogues. It is doubtless this specially polyvalent technique that allows the Hung-lou-meng to pack so much cultural information into so small a space. It has become something of a truism on studies on the novel to call it an "encyclopedia" of the old Chinese literati culture. Even Wang Hsiieh-t'ai's article on omens and riddles, a piece marked by great resistance to the book's imaginative world, still grants it the dubious title of "Encyclopedia of Feudal Society." An impression of encyclopedic fullness, set against an ending that seems to negate it all, doubtless prompts Andrew Plaks to conclude his unusually perceptive study with this summary of Pao-yti's career: "Pao-yii's final act, then, may be interpreted as an illusory exit from the red dust of illusion by means of a withdrawal into the self."5 Plaks's reading requires that we posit a double allegory. First, the "stone" story has to be taken as a merely metaphorical way of designating the self, and next, since Pao-yii's transformation, while necessarily a product of the novel's allegorical language, nevertheless represents an error on the ethical and interpersonal plane, it may and must "be interpreted" so as to set it straight. For Plaks, withdrawal betrays a failure to integrate within oneself the totality of the allegorical universe, of which the Ta-Kuan Yuian is both part and reduced model. But it is also in the perspective of totality that room can be found for impartial justification of Pao-yti's error. One is reminded of the monks in chapter 1, with their recognition of folly as part of unalterable law: "Viewed from the perspective of the five-elements totality of the existential universe, his final act emerges as simply an integral part of the harmonious whole."52 But like all schemes for universal harmony, this championing of totality needs the cooperation of all its elements. As a delusion within an allegory, the stone's story must know its place. ...the possibility of interpreting the entire 'red-chamber dream' as a false illusion-the opposite of the 'true' vision of the Buddhist monk, the Taoist priest, and the pre-incarnate stone-presents itself repeatedly.. But. . . within the breadth of vision that characterizes the work as a whole, even truth and falsity, reality and illusion, must be treated as complementary possibilities rather than dialectical antitheses.., the patently 'false' story of Chia Pao-yti may still manifest a certain degree of positive truth regarding the human condition in the world of experience.53 5OQuintilian, Institutiones viii. 6. 45. Quintilian's Latin translation of the Greek allegoria as "inversio" makes the trope a ratio between forms of expression. Contrast Andrew Plaks, op. cit., pp. 95, 125. Pauline Yu's reasons for arguing that "allegory" is an inappropriate name for the analogies of the Shih-ching, ("Allegory, Allegoresis and the Classic of Poetry, HJAS 43.2 [1983]: 377-412) put similarly specific restrictions on the subject-matter of allegories. 51Plaks, op. cit., p. 210. 52Ibid., p. 211. 53Ibid., pp. 222-223.</page><page sequence="24">46 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 9 (1987) More suggestive, both for the theory of allegory and for the elaboration of the conditions under which Plaks's book must be read, is his representation of Chinese allegory as a synecdochical, rather than a metaphorical mode. It is predicated on the specifically spatial vision of a "single, intelligible ground of being" where the conflict of potentially warring principles can always be contained and neutralized. The "encyclo- pedic allegory," like the universe, contains night and day, cold and hot, etc., but the linearity of literary presentation compels it to render this totality one phase at a time like a news agency sending a picture over the telegraph. Through "multiple periodicity" it is able to evoke "complementary bipolarity." This gives the novel an architecture rather like a large apartment building's - say the house forming the backdrop of Georges P6rec's vast compartmental novel La Vie Mode d'Emploi. Each story, each phase of being, stands in a relation of contiguity, mere juxtaposition, to its neighbors, but even that tenuous relation is made meaningful by their simultaneous coexistence in the whole. But if the category of time, or the related one of logical exclusion, is allowed to impinge on these purely spatial relations, will this not give the novel a structure less like an apartment house and more like that of Box and Cox, or Charley's Aunt? On the basis of the "riddle" structure discussed earlier, it could be argued that it is only the apparent linearity of its temporal development that keeps the novel from collapsing into a bald statement of identity or contradiction. The formula for the novel's rendition of totality is in fact given by a passage cited near the beginning of Plaks' book: El 1 fi rh F!lJ I .54 "Sun and moon alternate [literally "push one another out"] and thus light is born." That a whole-say the unity-within-opposition of night and day, or summer and winter-is never seen as such but can only be collected gradually from the alternations of its parts, each occupying a moment and a corner of the narrative, is not accidental but essential. The only totality occurring in the Hung-lou-meng is the totality of a vision which is about to be displaced by its opposite. Its closest analogues in experience are perhaps paranoia or religious conversion: a whole theory of life is illuminated and abolished by another which comes to replace it. The wholeness which Plaks chides Pao-yui for abandoning could only be a wholeness formed by two effects which cancel each other out, or the unsteady repose of the irresistible force and the immovable object. Perhaps an explanation for the Hung-lou-meng's peculiar gravitational force can now be offered. Its allegory springs from an interaction with its (frequently unwilling) reader. The story's extravagance compels the reader to choose, just as its characters are shown doing again and again, a metaphorical solution over a literal one-literal, that is, only within the story, but metaphorical to the eye of common sense. The choice between readings therefore comes down to a choice, not, as it may have seemed, between realism and allegory, but between two kinds of allegory. This may seem to be no choice at all-and rightly so. For there is another reason why the choice held out by the novel is a false one-this time a reason residing in us. The interpretation we have been holding up as a reversed image of Kao's is not particularly mysterious or elusive, but it is hard to sustain. The hero's petrification seems to block the way to any further intelligibility. Even in chapter 1, it was only after the stone had grown a human tongue and begun to express desires that it was able to become part of the story's action, instead of a prop. But-if one wants to be quite literal-the Stone as stone stands outside any human interpretation. 54Ibid., p. 46 (citing I-ching, "Hsi-tz'u" .j$4 ).</page><page sequence="25">Saussy, Reading and Folly in Dream of the Red Chamber 47 A reading can point at it but not fill its mere idea. Humanistic readings may look like crude strategies for reappropriating the majestic senselessness of this ending, but is it really possible to face up to the stone without anthropomorphizing it? If the empty knowledge that a stone is a stone seems a poor ending for this long, intricate novel, perhaps we can conserve the values, if not the letter, of the "Buddhist" readings and call the stone a symbol of the death to the world and to the self to which the novice monk is called. In that case, it is still worldly to the extent that monkish retirement is a human thing to do, and not the sort of thing that occurs to a stone. When the stone surfaces at the two extremities of the novel covered with magical writing, this too seems to warn us that there is more to the image than the mass and color of jade.55 It seems all too transparent to say that in the end the fictional third person becomes equivalent to the book of his life-and so to reveal the book's autobiographical origins; or else, to say that the character dies a human death and is preserved in memory by lines graven on a tombstone. Of course, either of these versions makes the stone into more than a stone: a hardened outcome of human life, experience and work, a stone with a human face. The novel is an allegory because we cannot, any more than can Kao, Plaks or Ch'en, understand it save in a metaphorical way. As persons, we are ill-qualified to fathom its impersonality. So finally the reader's inadequacy proves the text's power. And this is one reason for the Hung-lou-meng's peculiar beauty. Like all works in the mode of the sublime, it succeeds in pointing at something that is, properly speaking, unsayable. The adequate model for this book may not be the Freudian dynamic of repression and elaboration after all, but rather Saussure's "zero sign"56-the formless sign that nonetheless functions as a bearer of meaning by its non-equivalence to every other sign. 55Here I follow a long-standing tradition of Hung-lou-meng readers-the search for the one image that will represent the whole novel (cf. Soong et al. on the Ta-Kuan Yiuan). The alternatives of "boy" and "stone" obviously refer back to the reader's indecision as to whether the novel is an autobiography or an invention. The hero's petrification resolves these doubts - if only we take the motif literally. (The occurrence of similar stone-motifs in other works of Chinese fiction-the Shui-hu chuan for example-would make the stone another marker of intertextuality.) 56Ferdinand de Saussure, Cours de linguistique gtndrale (Paris: Payot, 1972), p. 124.
