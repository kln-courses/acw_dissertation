<plain_text><page sequence="1">Indian History Congress Prize Essay ASHOKA'S PERCEPTION OF NATURE AND MAN: A STUDY IN ART AND ATTITUDE Abhay Kumar Singh The courtly nature of Mauryan art, its Persian antecedents and foreign inspiration, its animal symbolism and aesthetic qualities etc., have been long debated.1 However, often has been missed, the discussion about thé emperor's choice of the objects, components and rudiments, namely, the symbols and motifs repreenting the idea, which form the basic material of the art. Visual art is a translation of vision and the creator's selection of the elements i.e., objects and subjects, to convey his concept (or message) not only determines the quality of his art but also provides an insight into his disposition. The creation of the similes and metaphors to suit his theme, gives a glimpse of the authors 'universe'; his perception of art and also the world around him. The values and the attitude of the exponent are discernible, thus. The following investigation in Mauryan art is also a study about emperor. Ashoka's mind, his perspicacity of man, flora and fauna, as is revealed by the study of his sculptural art and inscribed edicts. The sculptural art of the reign of Ashoka comprises of the inscribed and polished monopolithic pillars, their crowning (animal) capitals, and the elephant figures sculpted or engraved in rock or in the chiselled facade of the rock-hewn caves.2 Sculptures of the yakshi and yakshas , carved in the round are masterpieces of Mauryan art, but scholars consider that these were not created under the paronage of Ashoka, and belong to the reign of some of his successors.3 Nevertheless, there is no doubt that even prior to Ashoka's rule some inspiration/ influence had arrived from the West that stimulated the talent of sculptural art in India, particularly in relation to human portrayal. Recently, Paul Le Valley has concluded that the Mauryan yaksha and yakshi sculptures are akin to the Greek sculptural ideals on human body proportions Le Valley's study4 revitalizes the 'Refuge Artists Theory' of Wheeler. Despite the knowledge, talent and opportunity, emperor Ashoka did not employ his artists to produce the kind of xsculptural art that was produced later on. Ashoka's supported art was not devoid of subject matter. His theme was dhamma5 and 'humanity' but the human</page><page sequence="2">132 IHC: Proceedings , 65th Session, 2004 being figured nowhere in his art. Instead of the human depiction, the patronized art gave primacy to the animal world, which was sculpted very sensitively. The Dhauli elephant and the Rampurva and Sankisa bulls are the most praise-worthy sculptures of this class. The Sarnath capital of the four addorsed lions is the finest example of the stylized and elegant art of Ashokan patronage. We shall seek to understand the reasons for the conspicuous absence of human depiction, in contrast to the plentiful animal representations, in the patronized art of Ashoka. There must have been sound reasons for the avoidance of human figures in the art even while he used the talents and skills of his sculptors for making fascinating animal sculptures, instead. The Fauna: The emperor's love for the faunai world is evident from the prime place that animals occupy in the patronized art. The primacy and precedence relates not only to their actual position in that art but also in their utilization in the imagery and symbolism for the transmission of message. The correspondence between the animal symbolism and Buddhist lore was also fully exploited.6 Ashokan art is evocative and inspiring. It is tender and appeals to the inner-self by its visual grace. It is comforting to the eye and the heart as it avoids any kind of violence in its form, expression and in its composition. There are no contrasts in the subjects. No floral decoration robs the charm by diverting the attention from its tranquility. There are neither negative impulses nor any critical suggestions, all the subjects depicted in the art are placid and calm. The sequence of the animals on the abacus is punctuated by nothing else but the dhammachakra , for the sake of total harmony. The choice of the animals in the sculptural art has largely been associated with lion, bull, elephant, horse and geese.7 However, the camel (at Udaigiri) and griffins (on structural columns at Pataliputra) are also seen. The stone-discs/ ringstones (which lack the central perforation) have the pictures of rhino, deer, ram, peacock, owl, duck, horse and camel, besides the imaginary unicorn, sphinx, winged lion and the griffin.8 Nevertheless, only the real animals dominate in Ashokan art, both in their placement (on crowning capital or the abacus) and artistic rendering. The Dhauli rock elephant evokes a 'feeling of live flesh rendered with remarkable naturalism of a dynamic character'9; the Sankisa capital elephant has 'heavy naturalism' and the stylized Sarnath lions are portrayed with a 'formal precision'10</page><page sequence="3">Ancient India 133 which is unparalleled and superseeds all Western affinities. The art reflects a 'realism born of personal knowledge*. 11 Ashoka's love for the animals is attested by his art and edicts. He exhorted man in his minor rock edict III to abstain from killing living creatures'12 and went a step ahead by introducing a law for stopping killing of animals in his minor rock edict IV.13 He sought to teach people how to respect living creatures in his minor rock edict IX.14 In order to inspire people he resorted to display heavenly spectacles and powerful vehicles like an elephant in minor rock edict IV.15 Sculptural art as being a powerful means of display was also employed to evoke sentiments of appreciation for the virtues and grace of the creatures. The realistic presentation of the animals in art was aimed at touching the sensitively of human heart for the just and kind treatment to the animals. The Human We know that the expertise of the Mauryan sculptors was not limited to sculpting gracious animal figures only. The same talent produced marvellous art pieces like the Didarganj Yakshi/Chauri-be&amp;rer , the Parkham Yaksha , the Patna Yaksha , Lohanipur torso, all of which were modelled on the realistic body shapes and figures of human form. Here, one may wonder that despite the available excellent craftsmanship in modelling why emperor Ashoka avoided the representation of the human figures in the artwork that he commissioned. The answer lies in the choice of the Emperor and not elsewhere. Recently, in a critical evaluation, Bhuvanendran16 has pointed out that the absence of human figure in Ashokan art was explained by Nihar Ranjan Ray, on the basis of Ashokan ideology; for as Ray had commented, "The social and religious ideology of Ashoka characterized by a sense of ethical purity and rational outlook as evidenced in his edicts, is essentially Indo- Ary an.' 17 Here, Ray was referring to the "theory of ethnic genesis of art" in line of the thought of Strzygowski, and seems to be a believer that Indo-Aryan art was a facet of the Northern or Nomadic Art. Ananda Coomaraswamy also had not pondered over the issue since he believed that "... in the anthropomorphic art of native Indians there is no essential stylistiG distinction, the treatment is equally abstract in both cases; for both eschewed the illusionistic art."18 In fact, the scholars were convinced by Strygowski 'Theory of Abstract Rhythmic Nomadic Art of Aryans.19 Truly, Ashoka's sculptural art fully avoided the depiction of the human beings. One may argue that the reason could have been the</page><page sequence="4">1 34 IHC: Proceedings , 65th Session , 2004 relation of this art to Buddhism, if not directly, at least symbolically. In those times the master could not be depicted in human image and form due to religious prohibition. The symbolic presence of the Lord was seen in the art of the Sunga - Satavahana days, too. However, Buddha's association could be symbolised by the choice of the animals, some of whom were linked to Buddha's previous incarnations according to the Jatakas. Many scholars believe that the animals selected to adorn the abacus or the capital itself, were chosen for this reason.20 Buddha was the " Shkya-simha" or the "Lion of the Shakya clan"; he was "the White One" or Seto" at Dhauli, or the " Gajatame " captioned at Kalsi rock "the best elephant" in a previous incarnation. In short, these creatures represented or indicated (the presence of) Buddha. However, we may still argue that there are many animals (like the prancing hòrse on the abacus of the Sarnath capital or the camel on the lion capital from Udaigiri) which do not have any connection with Buddha's incarnations; and conversely, there are many species related to the previous births of the-Buddha which do not find representation in Ashokan art. Hence, the selection of the animals was guided by no other motive but the patron's choice. The few animals that could be endowed with the charm that served the purpose of the art were chosen. But it is significant even in early Buddhist art of Sanchi, Bharhut and other places, the male and female devotees are pictured in abundance. It means that there was^no bar to the portrayal of the laity as human beings or their natural anthropomorphic figures. No symbolic representation was needed for them. The presence of human figurai art in terracottas also cannot be overlooked.21 There are refined ones with elaborate headgears and ornaments (belonging to the elite art classification) and also, the crude and nude ones. The folk art represented in -the terracottas has plenty of human representations of females or mother-goddesses. The representation of a female figure on a gold-leaf plaque was unearthed from Lauriya-Nandangarh and another female figure from the Piprahwa stupa. A sorrowing woman statuette was found at Sarnath. Some punch-marked coins ascribed to the Mauryan period also depict the human figures.22 Therefore, to reject human figurai representation from sculptural art was not a Buddhist prohibition. Again, its seems to be the patron's decision. The Attitude It is necessary to refer to the inscriptional evidence to comprehend the emperor's attitude towards man and other creatures and find about his estimation of both. Ashoka issued his edicts after he had waged the</page><page sequence="5">Ancient India 135 war upon Kalinga, and had emerged as an emotional man. He had learnt to respect life in every form. A survey of the epigraphs shows that he dwelled upon the ethical upliftment of man and his rightful conduct. In a sense, Ashoka was aware of the imperfections of man and the resultant devastation that human infirmity wrecked upon the human and animal world each day. He was particularly touched by the unjust treatment meted out to innocent man and animals. The major rock edict -XIII gives account of the war and the emperor's remorse, and also mentions that more regrettable to him was the suffering he had caused to those who practised obedience towards the first-born(?), parents venerable persons and becoming behaviour towards friends, acquaintances, companions, relatives, slaves, servants, etc.23 An emperor who could realise the fraility of his own nature, surely was conscious of the imperfections of the common human being. Man lost esteem in his eyes for nursing sinful passion. In pillar edict-Ill, Ashoka says, "Man only sees his good deeds.... But he sees in no wise his evil deeds ... But difficult indeed is this self-examination. Nevertheless man ought to pay regard to the following.... 'Such ( passions ) as rage, cruelty, anger, pride, jealousy {are those) called sinful'. ..."24 Again, pillar edict VII Ashoka related that the ".... kings who lived during the past ages conceived this wish, 'Might mankind in some way grow the growth of the sacred law! But mankind did not grow a befitting growth of the sacred law."25 He was convinced by a negative opinion about mankind as pillar edict-IV reveals to us. Loss of faith in human nature and concern for its restoration is noticeable in his other directives particularly to "firm attachment" or resolve. In minor rock edict IV he lamented that "A long period, many hundreds of years, have passed, during which the slaughter of animals, the cruel treatment of created beings, the unbecoming behaviour towards relatives and the unbecoming behaviour towards ascetics and Brahmanas have only increased."26 Man, as perceived by Ashoka, seems astray and so devoid of any divinity. Man needed to practice dhamma for welfare in this world and the next. Without compassion and dhamma , the human being was an ignorant, arrogant and atrocious creature. The stance of Ashoka clearly focuses more upon the infirmities of human nature and he saw little to admire in man that could make him a worthy subject of any glorious art. He made no attempt to glorify the human being or even his royal personage or ancestors. This falls in contrast to the habit so common with the contemporary Greeks and the later-day Kushanas. Ashoka did not take any grandiloquent epithets either. Probably in his</page><page sequence="6">1 36 IHC : Proceedings , 65th Session , 2004 mental complex and purposeful self-denying humility was built upon the shame for the violence committed in Kalinga. Or, may be for being born a human being. Man, out of his imperfections and passions was the cause of most of the ills of the world, and hence he was not a suitable object to be used in the art to impress his own class. The animal motif superseded man in this sense. This can explain the total absence of human representations in the art on pillar capitals or abacus, and friezes in the caves. Conclusion Peace in the Nature has often been the resort of those distressed with civilization and its wars. However, Ashoka's concern appears to be limited to the living world, because he makes no comments of appreciation for the flora. In his art, there is visible neglect for the vegetation. The "knop and honey-suckle" or the palmette or nagapusha are merely decorative features.27 Fascination with animals and favour for the living creatures find priority in Ashokan attitude. In his love for animals, he emerged as the protector of the fauna against the atrocious man. The protection granted to the animal world, tamed or wild, is wide and immense. In his enthusiasm, Ashoka overlooked the violent nature of many animals and reptiles; just as he ignored talking about the virtues of mankind. While he knew that wild life could not be changed, he had faith that man could be rectified and reformed. For the subject of art, his choice was restricted to the few placid postured that reflected grace, calm, restrained-power, devotion, poise and serenity. There were many virtues to be learnt from the animal world. To the uncaring, arrogant and violent man, this was perhaps an unspoken message from the Emperor. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 . The frequently used term "Court Art" was used by Coomaraswamy who drew distinction between "court art"/ "official art" and "folk art". Ray used the term 'Maury an Court Art'. Recently, S.R Gupta defined the Court art of the West Asian model and distinguished it with the Mauryan art in its nature. Different scholars assigned different sources to the origin of Mauryan art, for example, Hellenistic (J. Marshall) West Asiatic-Indigenous (A.K. Coomaraswamy), Indigenous (Bacchofer); Graeco-Persian Imperial. (N. Ray); Graeco-Iranian-Bactrian (D. Schlumbeyer, P. Bernard); Graeco-Persian /Perso-Achaemenian (R.E.M. Wheeler). West Asiatic- Indigenous (V.S. Agarwal) Vedic (John Irwin); Indigenous (S.P. Gupta), Achaemenid (U. Singh); Indigenous + Western Asiatic source (Chakravarti); and Asiatic (R.N. Mishra). 2. Among the material relics of the Mauryan art, the Monoliths or erected pillars with/ without capitals have been termed as "Epigraph Monuments".

Let us be reminded that, "Scholars have traditionally studied the motifs of the capitals, believing that these held the key to the meaning and iconography of the pillars. However, John Irwin has demonstrated that the primary symbolism of these creations was in the concept of the pillar itself, the capital decoration being of secondary importance."

However, he hardly cared to present any floral beauty in his art and there is no truly identifiable plant or flower on the sculptures. His 'inverted lotus' confuses with the 'bell' and his ' nagapushpa ' flower is alike the acanthus.
