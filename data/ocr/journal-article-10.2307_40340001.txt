<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Desert of Lop. By Raoul Schrott. Translated by Karen Leeder. Pp. viii + 104. London: Picador. Pb. £12.99. Raoul Schrott is the most dazzling phenomenon of contemporary German-language literature. At forty, he has already published an 113</page><page sequence="2">Reviews astonishing number and range of books, including fiction, poetry, a treatise on angelology, an anthology of poetry translated from ancient languages, and a new rendering of the Epic of Gilgamesh alongside his own dramatized version. Most recently, in 2003, he brought out a 700- page novel entitled Tristan da Cunha which combines four interwoven narratives with encyclopedic information about the South Atlantic island, and which has variously been lauded as an unwieldy masterpiece and denounced as an unreadable display of factual trivia. By their very titles, Tristan da Cunha and The Desert of Lop reveal Schrott's obsession with travel to the remotest parts of the globe. He was himself born on shipboard off the coast of Brazil, then brought up partly in Innsbruck and partly in Tunisia. Having studied and taught in Britain, France, and Italy, he now leads a hermit-like existence in the West of Ireland, emerging only to travel, promote his books, and astound the media with displays of learning that have attracted suspicions of charlatanry. To an English-speaking reader, Schrott most recalls the late Bruce Chatwin. They share a prodigious wealth of interests, a fascination with distant regions, a harmless tendency to embellish their biographies, and a powerful centripetal drive that pulls the miscellaneous contents of their minds into imaginative shape. Karen Leeder has done much to make Schrott known in the English- speaking world, by accompanying him on reading tours, by lecturing and writing on his work, and now by translating the text originally published as Die Wilste Lop Nor (Munich: Hanser, 2000). The English title rectifies an oddity whereby the desert (part of the Gobi) is always referred to in the text simply as Lop, the name 'Lop Nor' being explained as that of a dried-up lake. The text consists of 101 short, numbered prose pieces. In the original, it is prefaced by the genre term 'Novelle', which has been dropped from the translation. The term is certainly more meaningful to German readers than to us, for it draws attention to affinities between Schrott's fragmentary narrative and the nineteenth-century German novella. The novella typically uses a framework set in the present to recount an inner story retrospectively. Here the narrative present is set in Egypt, where the protagonist, Raoul Louper, hears mini-lectures on the formation of sand-dunes from a Hungarian scientist and retaliates by recounting his many spur-of- the-moment journeys - to Japan, Newfoundland, Peru - in which he formed transitory relationships with three women: Ariette, Elif, and Francesca. As Karen Leeder has noted elsewhere, the last letter of each name is the first of the next: the three women form a closed emotional circle from which Raoul is ultimately shut out by his inability to sustain a relationship. 114</page><page sequence="3">Translation and Literature 14 (2005) What really attracts Raoul is the phenomenon of musical sand. Sands that squeak, whine, groan, thunder, or even emit a musical note like that of a double bass, can be found in many parts of the world, and Raoul searches for them in Algeria, Nevada, and finally the desert of Lop. (Brief reference is made to the singing sands on the Scottish island of Eigg; Schrott's claim that they have ceased to sing since a new groyne was built is, I believe, inaccurate.) This obsession brings us near the centre of Schrott's imagination. He combines a sharp sensory appre- hension of the natural world with a deep interest in natural science. For him, nature must not be seen in anthropomorphic terms. Instead of projecting our feelings into it, we should apprehend it as something wholly other than and indifferent to human life. In the forbidding, uninhabitable areas that most invite such an apprehension, the desert and the ocean, we sense the sublime. Of course, as Kant insisted and Schrott agrees, sublimity is not a property of nature itself; it is the point where, though we cannot get outside our human perspective, we encounter its limits. In this view, expounded in the introduction to his Tropen (1998; a translation by Iain Galbraith, Tropics, samples of which appeared in Translation and Literature in 2001, awaits publication), Schrott reveals the legacy not only of Kant but also of Nietzsche. Nietzsche relied on modern science to liberate humankind from God, providence, morality, and the other anthropomorphisms that stunted human life, and to reveal the world as amoral, innocent, and governed ultimately by the strength of human desire. With this vision, humankind could, as Wallace Stevens later put it, step 'barefoot into reality'. Just such an encounter with reality is enacted when Raoul Louper walks over sand- dunes that sing or mutter under his tread. The Hungarian professor compares the singing of sand to the sound of an aeolian harp, 'something which makes the world audible'. For such Romantic writers as Coleridge, the aeolian harp, stirred into music by the wind, was a means of hearing the voice of nature and appre- hending the divine life concealed within it. Schrott uses the same image without its religious ballast. The singing of the sand is an inhuman voice, sublimely unresponsive to us. This is how it sounds in the desert of Lop: 'As soon as evening fell, the sound set in with the wind and echoes all around. It carried far, long-drawn-out cries like the moaning of whales underwater, under tons of water.' Schrott's stripped-down prose, with its descriptive, quasi-scientific coolness, is wonderfully simple and lucid, and his translator has rendered it with great sensitivity into natural, understated English. The translation has received Schrott's advice and imprimatur, so one should 115</page><page sequence="4">Reviews not cavil too much at a few oddities. Some dunes which Schrott locates twenty-one miles south-east of Fallón, Nevada, have in this version been moved to twenty-two miles east (p. 23) . Raoul and Francesca here share a bathroom (p. 9), whereas in the original, more excitingly, they shared a bath. In the phrase To see the world in a grain of sand in the palm of one's hand, the world in an orchid' (p. 57), the second 'the world' should be 'heaven'; the change obscures an allusion to Blake which it seems a pity to lose. Aside from these discrepancies, however, this translation can be warmly recommended. Whatever verdict posterity may reach on Schrott's work as a whole, The Desert of Lop is a convincing poetic achievement which reveals new subtleties and interconnections as one re-reads it, and his translator has done Schrott and us a great service by conveying his style and tone with such sympathy.
