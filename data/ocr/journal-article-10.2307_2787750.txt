During my ethnological tour in the Naga Hills, Eastern Assam, in 1922, I made a minor discovery which is, I think, of some little interest in connection with the practice of using frictional fire-making ritualistically, as a means of taking omens. It is, of course, well known that very many peoples, even at the present day, resort to obsolete methods of making fire, when "new" or sacred and untainted fire is required for ceremonial and religious purposes, or when divination is the objective. Amongst the Nagas the traditional and by no means yet obsolete method of obtain- ing fire is that of sawing a flexible cane thong round a stick of light wood, which is held down on the ground by the operator's foot; the ends of the thong being alter- nately pulled so as to impart a sawing motion, which, by the friction against the under surface of the "hearth" stick, generates heat rapidly enough to cause the little pile of wood-dust, churned off in the process, to start smouldering. The time required for obtaining the spark is usually from 20 to 30 seconds, as I ascertained by timing the operation on several occasions. I have described this fire-making method and its geographical dispersal fully in a paper on "Frictional Fire-making [ 101 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 65.] MAN. [June, 1926, with a Flexible Sawing-thong " (Journ. Roy. Anthrop. Inst., XLIV, 1914, pp. 32 to 64). It is usual almost everywhere where this method is practised for the " hearth " stick to be split at that end which is to be subjected to the sawing-friction, a stone or piece of wood being jammed in the cleft to keep it open; and this appears to be invariably so amongst the Nagas when fire is generated for ordinary domestic purposes. I saw hundreds of used and discarded fire-sticks while touring the Hills, especially in the Sema, Ao and Lhota countries, all of which were split in the usual manner. A typical Sema example from the village of Seromi is shown, with its sawing-thong of cane, in Fig. A.* Many of the examples seen had doubtless been employed for ritualistic purposes, since these normal, cleft " hearth " sticks function for ceremonial as well as for domestic uses. But while I was strolling about in the Ao village of Chantongia, keeping a look- out for anything interesting, I noticed lying upon the ground a discarded fire-stick which had been used three or four times, but which was not split in the prevalent manner (Fig. B). As this was the first unsplit example which I had seen or heard of in the Naga Hills, I "collected " it with a view to making enquiries. With the kind help of my friend, Mr. 'Is p 7 k ID J. P. Mils, who was with me, and to whom I am greatly in- debted, it was ascertained from the Aos that such a stick would i il fl ,4 1 111 have been used solely for divina- tion or taking omens; and that 1i the reason for its not being cleft was that for purposes of augury it is unnecessary actually to pro- cure a spark. In other words, the successful generation of fire is not essential to this ceremonial procedure. All that is necessary J.--g; M gbf is to follow the normal procedure of the fire-making process, and to continue the sawing until the cane thong breaks. The C.

That end of the thong which was held in the right hand during the sawing process represents the individual or group on whose behalf the augury is taken; the end held in the left hand represents the antagonistic force (e.g., the enemy in warfare, the game in hunting, the spirits of disease in sickness, and so forth). The relative lengths of the fibres projecting from the two fractured ends will be compared, and the omen will be reckoned favour- able or the reverse, according to whether they are longer on the right hand half- thong or on the left. Other signs may also be studied in divination by this method, as, for instance, the small transverse cracks which appear upon the charred * The figures are all one-third the actual size of the specimens.

Since, then, in augury-taking by the fire-making procedure, the nature of the thong-fracture is the all-important factor, and actual ignition is unessential, it is not necessary to facilitate the procuring of a spark by splitting the " hearth "- stick after the fashion adopted where fire-production is the objective. Such was the explanation of the uncleft fire-stick (Fig. B) picked up in Chan- tongia; and shortly afterwards an Ao of the same village performed the divinatory ceremony in the presence of Mr. iMills and myself, using the " hearth "-stick which is shown in Fig. C, which also is not cleft at the end. The fact that in the Naga Hills the actual procuring of fire is unimportant in this ceremonial application of the fire-making method has a wider interest, as possibly explaining certain features noticeable in connection with the ritualistic use of this process elsewhere. Amongst the Kayans and Kenyahs of the Baram district of Sarawak, the practice obtains of resorting to frictional fire-making as a means of divination. As in the Naga Hills, the apparatus employed is the stick and flexible cane sawing-thong. Whereas the " hearth " is usually split, the thong is not invari- ably sawn across the cleft. One of the ritualistic purposes to which the fire-making process is applied is that associated with the ceremony of naming a child. When a name is tentatively suggested for the infant an appeal is made to Laki Pesong (who holds a dual office as God of Fire and Protector of Children), with a view to aseerS taining whether the name proposed is auspicious and sanctioned by the god. For this divinatory purpose the " hearth "-stick is frequently carved in anthropomorphic form, to represent Laki Pesong; and whereas the cane thong is sometimes sawn across the cleft (which separates the legs of the figure), it is in other instances sawn round one leg only of the image, which is tantamount to employing an unsphlit " hearth " (see examples figured, Figs. 7, 9, 10 and 12, in my monograph above referred to). This seems to suggest that, here again, it is immaterial whether fire is actually obtained or not; and, as a matter of fact, the augury is estimated by examination of the broken thong, as amongst the Nagas, though in Sarawak the nature of the omen is determined by comparing the lengths of the two portions of the snapped thong. It is favourable if these are of unequal length and unfavourable if their length is equal. In the event of an inauspicious equality being observed, the suggested name is deemed unacceptable and a new name is proposed, the suit- ability of which is tested as before. In view of these facts, it would be interesting to know whether success in obtaining a spark is unessential in divination with the fire-making apparatus among these Bornean peoples, as it is among the Nagas, This, at least, is suggested by the description of the procedure given by Hose and McDougall (" Pagan Tribes of Borneo," 1912, p. 160), though it is not actually so stated.
