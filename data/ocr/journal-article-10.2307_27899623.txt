<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY AND THE NOETIC POWER OF THE HEART. "And I perceived myself to be far off from Thee, in the region of unlikeness, as if I heard this Thy voice from on high: " 'I am the food of grown men ; grow, and thou shalt feed upon Me; nor shalt thou convert Me, like the food of thy flesh, into thee, but thou shalt be converted into Me/.... "And I said: 'Is Truth therefore nothing because it is not diffused through space finite or infinite?' "And Thou criedst to me from afar : " 'Yea verily, I am that I am/ "And I heard as the heart heareth, nor had I room to doubt, and I should sooner doubt that I live than that Truth is not, which is clearly seen_" Confessions of Saint Augustine, Dr. Pusey's transla tion, p. 155. THE recent discussions of the infinite, replete as they have been with interest to both the mathematician and the philosopher, have left quite untouched one historic aspect of the problem and one salient characteristic of the modern definition. As this feature has far-reaching implications in the realm of theology as well as philosophy, and leads to a distinctly monistic interpretation of life, The Monist seems a fitting forum in which to attempt its exposition and analysis. For any collection, concept, or thing to be proper object of thought it must be unambiguous and capable of being viewed as in some sense a whole or unit. The traditional difficulty in the con cept of infinite collections is how to view as a whole or unit that which is explicitly defined as endless. There is no need to repeat</page><page sequence="2">588 THE MONIST. here the arguments for and against the validity of this objection. One aspect of the problem alone is pertinent to our ends. The notion of wholeness or unity is found to imply one or all of three qualities. 1. Containing all of a certain class or kind of objects. 2. Excluding all of every other class or kind of objects. 3. Recognizable as in itself an individual. This recognition taking place through the individuality of the self of the thinker or knower. The first of these qualities or attributes has reference to the interior constitution or elements of that which is viewed as a whole ; the second refers to that which is exterior to the object considered; and the third has no reference at all save to the self of the knower. The older definitions and concept of infinite assemblages ob scured the first of these qualities while emphasizing the second. The numbers derivable by continued additions of one to the number n present an assemblage obviously infinite in the old sense. The quality of wholeness in this assemblage is imparted not by having all such numbers present to the view, but by the certainty that any such number may be viewed and by the definite exclusion of all other numbers or objects. As Cantor has phrased it, "it is intrinsic ally determined of everything in the universe, whether it is or is not an element of this assemblage.,,1 Hence the assemblage though endless is still unambiguous. But this lack of ambiguity and such unity or wholeness as the assemblage presents, is by no means derived from its endlessness. It arises from the character of the elements constituting it,?from the law of their derivation. It is the unity of this law which permits us to view the assemblage as itself a unit. It is a matter of accident, or at least of subsequent determination, whether the field of this law is infinite or finite. This dependence of the possibility of view ing an infinite assemblage as a unit upon a law connecting its ele ments, is of the utmost importance. Mere endlessness, without the existence of law, in no wise presents us with a definite concept, 1 Acta Mathematica, II, p. 363.</page><page sequence="3">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 589 with a whole, or with a unit. In this lies the actual negativeness of the older definitions, far more than in the negative aspect of the word endless. Yet this latter is not without significance. All definition is a matter of reference or comparison. Assuming the finite as the standard of reference, the infinite can not be derived from it save by direct negation or by the use of the very idea whose definition is sought. In the finite lies the infinite2 as in the infinite lies the finite, but the relation between them can only be expressed either through negation or through the infinite. The power of the modern definition lies in its recognition that the infinite can be referred only to the infinite and that every aggre gation of things to be viewable as a whole or unit must have some law connecting its elements. If there be a law of self representa tion, the system is infinite ; if there be not, it is finite. Or, to be more precise, any assemblage is infinite or finite according as there is or is not a one to one correspondence between the assemblage and a proper part of the assemblage. Now here is the crux of the matter. In this not one infinite but two are defined, the infinite whole and the equally infinite part ; or as Dedekind himself pointed out, and as Borei, Royce and others have ably expounded, an infinite number of infinites. The reference necessary for all logical definition is no longer between the finite and the infinite but between two infinites. There is profound significance in the acceptance of such a proce dure. It is an abandonment of the self-imposed limitation of the mind to the finite, of the one time delusion that man is a purely finite being and that all his knowledge must originate in and be referred to the finite. Once freed from this preconception, born in us by contact with matter, logical indications of the infinite char acter of man multiply on every side. Professor Royce has argued at length that the infinite sequence and order is the very type of the self, and the self representation of infinite assemblages has been skillfully connected with the phenomena of self-consciousness. In * Cf. Professor Keyser's papers : "The Axiom of Infinity," Hibbert Jour nal, Vol. II, No. 3, pp. 542 and 543; and Bulletin of the American Mathemat ical Society, 2d Series, Vol. VII, No. 5, pp. 222 et seq.</page><page sequence="4">59? THE MONIST. deed it was the "thought world" of man that Dedekind used as the assemblage on which to base his "existence proof" of the Infinite. Though it has since been objected3 that such proof was "circular" and must always be impossible as proof, the ground of this objec tion was not, as Mr. Russell took it, that some special axiom was covertly invoked in discussions on the infinite, but that the sense of the infinite was so deep rooted in the mind that it underlay all proof,?that it was subtly presupposed in all argument and to seek to prove it was as futile as to seek to prove one's own existence, that in consequence it could only be exhibited, not proved. Emer son's saying, paraphrased from most ancient writings, that in each atom the universe contrives to integrate itself, is given in this light a concreteness of meaning not seen in it before. That which is finite becomes viewed as but a determination from that which is infinite, as finite numbers are defined through infinite series. And the nature of man, through consciousness, through his power to create, through his power of self representation, is seen to be tech nically and literally infinite. But though man now knows himself to partake of the nature of the infinite, he none the less but rather the more knows himself to be one being and no other. Though we are freed in a large part from the limitations of finiteness we are still inexorably bound by the need of unity in every object of our thought or conception. The problem of unity is no longer the problem of finiteness but is still and always must be the central problem of knowledge. The relation between multiplicity and unity, how that which is one may be viewed as multiple, and how that which is multiple may be viewed as one, has long furnished a fruitful field of discus sion and controversy ; particularly since all multiplicity has been seen instantly to lead to infinite assemblages.4 In the case of these latter it has been indicated that the unity is to be sought in the relation between the elements, in the law by which this multiplicity arises. It has been seen that the term infinite as used in mathematics is 8 Hibbert Journal, Vol. II, No. 3, pp. 547 ei seq.; No. 4, pp. 809-812. * Cf. Royce, The World and the Individual, Vol. I, Supplementary Essay.</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 59* properly an adjective rather than a noun,?an attribute or quality seen to pertain to certain assemblages derived and viewable as a unit from other considerations than that of their infiniteness. It has been said that mere endlessness is in no complete sense definitive, for that which is endless may yet be sharply restricted and bounded in an infinite variety of ways, each way giving rise to a different concept. But if the assemblage is unbounded, unrestricted, and end less in all ways, to the notion of endlessness we have added the no tion of all-inclusiveness. The previous ambiguity no longer exists. We have reached what Mr. Russell has called the infinite of highest order, (holding in opposition to Cantor that such is possible)5 the totality of all things of all kinds in all relations. We have passed from the mathematical adjective infinite to the old theological in finity. However much we may be arrayed against certain of the mod ern mathematicians, we are certainly not departing from ancient tradition in holding that such a concept is very fundamental and intimate to human consciousness ; and in agreeing with Mr. Russell that it represents a genuine totality or unit, even though Mr. Russell is himself inclined to deny the inevitable psychological and theo logical inferences of his position.6 So holding, we are presented with at least one totality or unit which it is impossible to know by reference to that which is exterior to it. This brings us to an exaggerated form of a very vital aspect of the problem of unity; how are we to know, in and of itself, that which is one ? It is a very trite statement, but one which must nevertheless receive attention, that intellectual knowledge is always relative. The mind compares, relates, orders, and correlates. It weighs relations and compares things with things. The action of the mind is thus always dual-, and so many-, pointed. It can function only in multi plicity. Yet it cannot be denied we have knowledge of things in and of themselves, such knowledge as is given to us by our senses for B Cf. The International Monthly, Vol. IV, No. i, p. 95. ?

Such knowledge is not one of comparison, and such reference as there is in it is directly to the kn?wer. Therefore the distinction between knowledge of a thing in itself, and knowledge of the relations in which that thing is to other things, is a distinction known to experience as well as to metaphysics. Our problem is one of genuine significance. In the modern definition of the infinite we have a partial answer to our question. The multiplicity necessary for definition as well as for all logical activity is there furnished by the interior structure of the thing defined, by considering the whole and its part. This is obviously a knowledge of the assemblage in and of itself, but it is not knowledge of the assemblage as a unit. The concept of the assemblage as a multiplicity and the con cept of the assemblage as a unit are entirely distinct. Though the possibility of one concept may imply the possibility of the other, yet the one concept is not the other, and knowledge of the one is not necessarily knowledge of the other. Illustrations of this distinction are easily found, for example the one used by Bolzano, the concept of a drinking glass. Viewed as a whole it is one thing, viewed as an assemblage of broken parts it is another. The first concept im plies that it will hold water, the second implies no such thing. My friend is one thing, my friend and his indigestion quite another, though this indigestion be chronic. But there is no need of multi plying trivialities. The fact stands out sharply that the concept of unity presents the problem of knowing a thing in itself, apart from its relations to other exterior things, and apart from its relation to its own interior elements. By the very nature of this problem such knowledge can not be derived from intellectual processes. All multiplicity has been ex pressly eliminated, and multiplicity as we have seen, is the funda mental requisite for all logical thought. Repugnant as it is to the pride of the intellect, flushed with the conquest of such wide realms of nature, we are yet forced to conclude that in the appreciation of a thing in itself, in esse, the mind is baffled : that the limits of multi plicity are also the limits of the field of logic. But if the mind is many-pointed, the heart is single-pointed. The</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 593 action of the intellect is discursive, distributing the consciousness; the effect of love, desire and will is to concentrate and hold the con sciousness upon a single object. That this retention and fixing of the consciousness results in actual knowledge has been the claim of the mystics of all ages. To this claim we may listen with the more patience once it is realized that the inner essence and indi viduality of each and every thing in the universe, as well as the unity of the universe itself, must remain forever unknown to us, or be known through just such a process as the concentration of con sciousness resulting from love, desire, or will. But we do not need to rely upon historic mystical perception in order to be convinced that there are genuine noetic powers of the heart. We may appeal directly to every-day experience. The knowl edge and understanding springing from love and sympathy are neither remote nor hidden, but are among the most patent facts of human intercourse. In common phrase, they imply the ability to "put yourself in his place," and so to know him as he knows him self,?as an individual, neither by reference to exterior things, nor as a sum of parts, but as a unit in and of itself. Reason about a friend, and the knowledge derived is relative. We argue he is kinder than others, more unselfish, wiser perhaps. Love our friend and we perceive, not that he is kinder, but that he is kind, not that he is wiser but that he is wise. Such knowledge is not comparative but positive. In it there is reference, but this reference is wholly interior. It is to the qualities or elements of the individuality, not to anything without that individuality. As, however, the concen tration of consciousness continues, even this reference disappears. We no longer view the qualities of our friend, but his individuality itself absorbs our consciousness. We know him as a unit,?as that unique something which he is to himself, and of, and in, himself. This passage of the consciousness from qualities to inner es sence is equally manifested in the contemplation of natural beauty. As we have viewed the sunlight on some distant snowclad range, rising in calm still power from gracious slopes of green, it may be the myriad tones of color, the exquisite contrasts and play of light and shade that have first compelled our notice and admiration. But</page><page sequence="8">594 THE MONIST. as we continue to gaze these pass from the mind. The mind itself is stilled and the consciousness of the heart awakens, wraps itself around or flows into the scene before us, is moulded into its likeness and knows its spirit and its inner meaning. It is no reply to ask me what this inner meaning is. It escapes and forever must escape the mind, for it lies in the inner world of unities. It is felt by the heart, known by the heart, and by it the heart is uplifted. Something of peace and power and eternity for a time becomes our own. But it is not derived from reason nor can any logic prove its presence. Yet the great artists have seized and exhibited it. For as logic conveys the reference of the mind, so art conveys the perception of the soul. What has been attempted in these illustrations is a simple de scription of the actual change of consciousness. The appeal of my thesis is to immediate experience. Its truth rests directly on that inner recognition and certainty which is the foundation of all knowl edge, and to which it is the mission of logic to refer all things not so perceived. It is a curious psychological phenomenon that knowl edge by indirection should to so many appear more certain than direct perception. In the complicated structure of formally valid reference such minds forget that that to which reference is made is to the mind a pure assumption. Question any scientist as to the fundamental concepts or laws of his science and he will frankly admit they are hypotheses. Question the remote logical inferences of these postulates and he will hold you in derision. Formal valid ity is of the mind. Truth is of the heart. I am fully aware that in this last sentence I have exposed my self to the criticism of using undefined terms. What is Truth? I reply, I cannot say. It forever escapes definition. But its appeal I know, and it is directly to an inner feeling of certainty. It is ob jected that what appeals as certain to one does not so appeal to another. Perhaps this is so, I neither affirm nor deny it. Then truth is diff?rent for you and for me? Truth is individual. But truth if truth at all is universal. Truly, but so am I and so are you, yet need our universes be the same? Interpenetrating, interblending they always are, but the infinite contains within itself infinitely many</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 595 infinites, all distinct yet interblending, each individual, yet each a part, and, in definite sense, each one with the whole. So too, your universe and mine, your truth and mine, different and individual as they may be, may yet find their unity and reconciliation in a wider universe, a more inclusive truth, with which your truth and mine even now are one. It is their reliance upon direct perception that constitutes at once the strength and weakness of all mystical philosophies: their weak ness, because such perception is incommunicable; their strength because the perception of the heart brings to the individual ex periencing it a depth of conviction and certainty equal to that of self existence. It is impossible to read the utterances of the great mystical teachers, from Siddartha the Buddha to the Christian mystics of France, without being impressed with the genuineness and immediacy of experience which they record. Contrary to popu lar opinion it is mysticism not materialism that is the philosophy of experience. For what we know is that we are conscious and that there are states of consciousness. The existence of matter is an in ference from the qualities of consciousness. So close to immediate experience is mysticism that it is far more properly described as a life than as a philosophy. Its answer to objectors has ever been, "Ye have ears to hear and hear not, eyes to see and see not": its plea, "Live the life and ye shall know the doctrine." Its noetic states are states of being. The commonplace illustrations already given should be suffi cient to recall the kind of consciousness I have described as single pointed or directly perceptive, and which, when directed by love, results in a curious feeling of identity between the self of the per ceiver and the inner essence of the thing perceived. Born in the stillness of the mind and concerned with unity, we have seen that in this knowledge the reason has no share. Yet as a fact of ex perience this mysterious noetic process of the heart must take its place with other facts, forming with them a multiplicity whose re lations are proper subject of curiosity and reason. But at the out set we must be prepared to demand only analogy, only an ordered assemblage of mental concepts corresponding to the facts consid</page><page sequence="10">596 THE MONIST. ered,?for by hypothesis these facts include other than mental terms. Here the imagery of infinite collections may be again of service to us. Following the path Professor Royce has made so plain, we may view each and every individual as typified by an infinite se quence, struck out by infinitely varying laws of self-representation from the infinite All. The actual individuality, unity or essence of these lies, we have seen, neither in the mere fact of their infinity, nor in any one term or sequence of terms, but in the single law by which each represents the whole.7 In humanistic terms this cor responds to the doctrine that the true individuality of every man lies in the manner in which he mirrors the absolute. In terms of Christian theology it is that the essence of every man is his relation to God. As each assemblage represents the whole so each assem blage is self-representative in an infinite variety of ways,?one way for, and exactly corresponding to, each individual or other assem blage in the whole. Again in humanistic terms this corresponds to the statement that each man is one with his fellow man. The terms or elements of the assemblage may be variously interpreted ; as ex periences, temporal states, qualities, or what you will. The con sciousness of the heart, dealing with unities, lies in the law of self representation itself. The change and play of this consciousness, directed by will, consists in a change of attention or emphasis from one law of representation within the self to another. Love is the drawing power or attractive quality of life. It seeks unity with what it loves, and, when perfect, that which loves corresponds to or is one with what is loved. To impose this correspondence upon an infinite assemblage, is exactly to impose upon it the same law of self-representation as is exemplified by the assemblage to which it corresponds. The inner consciousness of the one who loves is thus in exact accord with the inner essence, meaning or unity of the one loved. The result is an identity of inner unity and an exact one to one correspondence of all elements. The knowledge derived from reason may be likened to the step by step comparison or correspondence of the elements of the two T Cf. Professor Royce, op. cit.</page><page sequence="11">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 597 assemblages. Quality after quality, or condition after condition is made to correspond with a like element. But the underlying funda mental law of representation or progression is never reached. For it must be remembered that no matter how great n may be, an in finite number of separate assemblages may have n terms in common. Actual and complete correspondence between the two assemblages is a correspondence between the laws of progression, acting at one stroke between all the elements. It is never realizable as a step by step verification, for this verification can never be complete. Here lies the analogy with the failure of reason to ever know the unity, the inner essence, or genuine individuality of that whose qualities it relates. To know God or man, beauty or truth, each must be loved and willed. If this analogy be at all critically examined it will be seen that in it the potential is viewed as actually present. Such is indeed my view. Every thing is; and everything that is, is real. All reality is in some sense present. To the mathematician questions of reality are resolved into questions of classification. Every concept is a real concept ; every fact, a real fact ; every contradiction, a real con tradiction ; every potentiality, a real potentiality. No category, class or domain is exclusively real. Error arises through attributing to one domain that whose real existence is without that domain. A plane triangle the sum of whose angles is greater than two right angles is as real as one whose angles equal two right angles. Yet we would be in error if we attributed the first to the domain of Euclidean Geometry. For this system is a coherent unit. Each of its axioms, postulates, or presuppositions, is a definite statement, sharply dividing reality into two classes, one consisting of those elements which obey this axiom, the other of those elements which do not. Together these definite statements determine a domain common to all, whose content the reason exposes in detail, but which is absolutely predetermined before the application of reason, and to which nothing can either be added or taken away. But Euclidean Geometry does not exhaust reality and our triangle whose angles are greater than two right angles finds its place in equally real non-Euclidean systems.</page><page sequence="12">598 THE MONIST. So, too, the unborn child is equally real with the growing boy. We would be in error at this time to ascribe to the first separate physical existence. For, from moment to moment, the domain of separate physical existence is sharply defined and its content pre determined. But no more than Euclidean Geometry, does present physical existence exhaust the world of reality, though, like the play of consciousness, it may in its temporal progression and in infinite time sweep over and embody all reality. To question the reality of any object of thought is to confuse the issue,?as well question the reality of my keys because they are not in the pocket where I first search for them. They could not be object of search were they not real. In this view the merely possible as well as the potential have definite reality. They are present as all reality is present. Though not realized in a given state of consciousness they are present in consciousness as potential states, present even in the given state as potentialities. In the analogy of infinite assemblages, we have seen that each individual or assemblage is self-representative in an in finite variety of ways?one way for each other individual or assem blage in the whole. We have likened each law of self-representa tion to the state of consciousness which is knowledge of that assem blage to which this law corresponds. We may clarify the whole matter and particularly the subject of potential consciousness by a concrete illustration. Let the assemblage of positive integers I, 2, 3, 4. typify the manifested whole. It is infinitely self - representative. Three such self-representations, typifying three individuals are (A) 2, 4, 6, 8, io,. 2n (B) 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,. 3? (C) 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,. 5tt The individuality or inner essence of these three may be likened to the three laws of self-representation by which they were struck out from the whole and by which they progress. These are respectively 2n, 3?, and 5n, where n proceeds as the whole proceeds.</page><page sequence="13">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 599 The state of consciousness corresponding to the knowledge of B by A is represented by the law $na where na proceeds as A pro ceeds. It is (Ab) 6, 12, 18, 24,. I I I I (B) 3, 6, 9, 12,. In this we see the inner essence of A, its twoness, determining the type of correspondence existing between it and B, determining its reaction from the external universe. The inner essence of B de termines the law of self-representation within A, the selection and bringing to attention of a certain definite sequence of elements from the infinite richness of A's interior content. Another way of putting it would be the common expression that A, knowing B, vibrates in unison or harmony with B, the character of vibration is determined by B, but that which vibrates and the character of unison or harmony is determined by A, by the character of the harmony between A and the whole. The state of consciousness corresponding to the knowledge of C by A is similarly given by the law $na and is : (Ac) 10, 20, 30, 40,. I I I I (C) 5, 10, 15, 20,. Now obviously these noetic processes by which A knows B and C are self-representative processes within A, and whether the process Ac was ever actually performed by A or not it is always potentially present in A's individuality. According to our analogy therefore the knowledge of everything in the universe is potentially present in each individual thereof. Moreover there is that which corresponds to this potential knowledge in every noetic state of consciousness. That is to say, in the state of consciousness in which A knows B there is that which corresponds to the state by which he would know C. Thus within (Ab) 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,.z% there is the sequence or representative system $n where n pro ab b ceeds as A^ proceeds</page><page sequence="14">6oo THE MONIST. (\) 3?&gt; 60, 90, 120,.sn I I I I (C) 5, 10, 15, 20,.sn Thus every noetic state contains within itself the potentiality of every other noetic state, and knowledge of the inner essence of any one thing in the universe contains in potentiality knowledge of every other thing and of the whole itself. The correspondence (6) between this potential knowledge and its object, depends both upon the inner essence of the knower (2) and the inner essence of the object (3) of the noetic state in which this potentiality is viewed (2X3=6) ; while its rhythm or essence (30) depends upon both these factors and also upon the inner essence (5) of its object. (2X3X5=30-) Beyond its application to potential consciousness this illustra tion bears upon a very common phenomenon of affection. We are all familiar with examples where what is loved is in reality a product of the lover's imagination,?a concept and pictured individuality which has but a remote correspondence to that to which it is at tached in the lover's mind. In this attachment there is obvious error. But this error and confusion of identity in no way arises from any failure or uncertainty in the noetic power of love but solely in a failure actually to love the one we call our friend. Nevertheless we have seen that, though the ideal conception alone be loved, yet in the noetic state engendered there throbs a minor rhythm gen uinely, if remotely, corresponding to the object to which we mis takenly attribute the fundamental chords. This lies in the heart as potential knowledge, and I would submit that its presence there may in the midst of error constitute a deeper insight into verities than any faultless mastery of attributes can give. A text for such a thesis might well be drawn from our modern nature books, which breathe a love of all wild life, but whose anthropomorphic animal psychology is not free from criticism. Suggestive and illuminating as it is to follow the analogy of in finite sequences along other of its manifold ramifications?into the realms of free-will and predestination, of invariance and continuity in a world of change, of distinction between terms and relations,</page><page sequence="15">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 601 and of how all its possible relations lie wrapped in the nature of the term itself,?these though interesting do not here concern us. The process of the realization of potential knowledge now claims attention. Here we are apparently confronted with two general methods of procedure. The first is the process of comparison, elimination, and generalization ; the second of free conception or, as I trust will become obvious, of direct perception. These are generally consid ered as quite distinct. The first, being scientific in character, is supposed an act of the intellect, to which we are impelled, and whose results are determined, by the facts themselves. The other is popularly viewed as a rather purposeless and entirely arbitrary act of the imagination having little reference to facts of any kind. On examination, however, the aspect of logical necessity is found largely to disappear from the first process and the two are seen to be by no means as different as they were at first thought. For however great a part ratiocination may play in the comparison an tecedent to generalization, the conception of the general law itself is never an act of reason. Always it is creative. In it there is choice, desire, will, but never logical compulsion. By it something new is born from the world of the potential to the world of the actual,?something other than, and in no legitimate sense a con sequence of, what has preceded. For as any given set of terms are included in an infinite number of infinite sequences, so any given body of phenomena admit of an infinite variety of explanation,8 and find their place in infinitely varied systems of potential knowl edge. Nor is one of these true and all others false. As a landscape may be represented by a verbal description, a painting, or a map, so we may choose at will the type of correspondence between our concepts and phenomena. But it is not this freedom of permitted correspondence which causes the instability and ever changing fashions in scientific hy pothesis. It is an inherent weakness resident in the very nature 8 Cf. Poincar?, "Relations entre la Physique Experimentale et la Physique Math?matique," (Rapports pr?sent?s au Congr?s Internationale de la Physique. Paris, 1900. Tome I, p. 1.)</page><page sequence="16">6o2 THE MONIST. of the scientific method. Its cause and origin lie wrapped in the problem of unity. Patiently, laboriously, with marvelous ingenuity, from generation to generation science has observed and related terms. But till the end of time such accumulating data can never reveal their inner essence. For so long as they be finite, they are not definitive. The truth, the general law by which they represent the whole, is not determined by them. But if further observation cannot reveal the truth it may point out error. Though n + I distinct terms, as well as n, admit of an infinite number of containing sequences or functional laws, yet there are an infinite number of sequences which contain the first ? terms and which do not contain the added n + ist. Every new observation eliminates an infinity of previously valid possible hy potheses. But this elimination is never exhaustive and by it deter mination is never reached. Thus it is that generalization succeeds generalization and brilliant hypothesis gives way to hypothesis still more fertile,?each proceeds for a space in unison with the ad vancing sweep of recorded facts, then their orbits part. It has often been held that mathematical induction presented a special exception to the otherwise universal impossibility of logical generalization. Such is not the case, for the two processes are totally distinct. Generalization is concerned with terms. Mathe matical induction is concerned with the unity of the entire assem blage, with the law of its progression. In brief, proof by mathe matical induction consists of this: Having given the law of pro gression it is shown that a certain property or quality is an invariant of this progression. If, therefore, this property is found anywhere in the assemblage it is known to be present everywhere. The un fortunate statements of this proof in mathematical text books have done much to conceal its genuine philosophic import. It is, in effect, a determination of the unchanging qualities of an individual through a knowledge of the inner essence or unity of the individuality itself. In this, reason appears as but the interpreter of the intuition, reveal ing the content of the concepts given it. A review of the successive generalizations and hypotheses of science thus shows every advance to be a new, and in large part free,</page><page sequence="17">THE PROBLEM OF UNITY. 603 conception of the creative imagination; a substitution of a unity known, because self-created, for a unity unknown but felt. Toward these conceptions we are guided by the observed facts, but in their creation there is always choice, always will,?always something ex pressing the human purpose and contributed from the heart of man himself. To understand the process by which the potential becomes the actual we must look to the heart and the will. We have already seen that in the knowledge of the heart the potential is ever present. The existence of will and desire alike depend upon this presence. For desire is the yearning of the heart for what is not yet realized, and will is precisely that power by which realization is accomplished. As the essence of man is one with the essence of the whole, so, given over to the desire of his heart, man is lifted to the utmost limits of the manifested universe. Around him is the swirl and vague chaotic rush of unborn things,?formless but infinitely potent. All that is, is seen upborne by what is yet to be. So standing, as a God between two worlds, man knows him self of both. Here, in this infinite wild sweep, is the battle of his will. By it he claims his own and compels the law of his desire. By the heart of man, from the unseen is born the seen. In the analogy of infinite sequences we have shown this to be the bringing to attention of a definite law of progression or self representation from the infinite variety of possible self-representa tions. If the total nature of man, the universe of his potential con sciousness, were likened to the assemblage of positive integers, the totality of known or realized realms might be represented by all the sequences r.n where r is any given constant number and n takes all integral values. Then the creation of a new domain of thought could be symbolized by the forcing to attention of some hitherto purely potential system, such as the sequence of primes or the se quence of powers of r, rn. Present they have always been, but in the knowledge of their unity something new is born. The potential has become the actual. It is not without interest to perceive that the totality of such potential and so realizable sequences within any assemblage is of a far higher order of infinity than the assemblage itself.

Such considerations how ever transcend the limits of this paper. The conclusions that I would draw from these views are as manifold and wide reaching as my subject. To one alone can I give prominence. It constitutes a twofold plea; first for the culti vation of the heart, and second for attention to its dictates. I make this plea not as a moralist, nor as a humanitarian, I can lay no claim to either, but solely as a man of science, as a lover of knowledge. To the heart ultimately all things are referred. In the depth of appreciation, in the sense of oneness with all that is, in the love of truth, in the purity of desire, and in the strength of will, must be sought the powfcr by which alone knowledge is born. To know fully and in detail we need the keenness and precision of the trained reason, but to know at all we need some power of the heart. And if this be granted me then I plead that the voice of the heart be not so often scouted. That which vibrates in it is in truth the song of life. We are not other than the whole. The idea we find within the heart is not set over against the universe but is its very essence, embodied in us as its image. I do not plead for blind acceptance. I plead only that to the voice of the heart we listen as to the voice of the senses. Neither lies to us. Sometimes we mis interpret each. But the test is always through the will.
