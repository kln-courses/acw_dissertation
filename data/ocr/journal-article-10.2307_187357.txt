<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION ON TELEOLOGY AND ORGANISMS* STEPHEN UTZ Louisiana State University This paper is about Charles Taylor's analysis (in [2]) of the explanatory schema "B occurs for the sake of G;" it answers a number of objections brought against Taylor's analysis by Larry Wright (in [4]). I shall argue that Taylor's analysis includes a means of defusing Wright's counterexamples. But in showing this, I believe that I also show Taylor's analysis to be ill-suited to its role in his general argument against behaviorism. Taylor and Wright both hold that scientific explanations may be irreducibly teleological. They stand opposed to the view that every significant teleological account of an event can be paraphrased without residue either by an efficient causal or by a statistical explanation of the event. There have of course been several powerful attempts to show that the latter sorts of explanation can capture the empirical content of any teleological explanation. Taylor and Wright are not concerned with the details of these attempts but set out instead to reveal what they hold to be a general failure by the reductionists to acknowledge the peculiarity that makes teleological explanation different. A good analysis of teleology may, in their view, lack the sort of precision which reductionistic accounts of teleology strive for. But in order to be interesting, a proposed analysis of teleology must fall short of assigning so distinctive a character to teleological statements as to raise the question whether such statements can properly be regarded as explanations. For example, on a possible sort of analysis, the statement that B occurs for the sake of G might be so interpreted that it could not be understood as picking out the cause of B's occurrence. Many philosophers have held, however, that statements cannot in any scientifically relevant sense tell us why something happens except by telling us what makes it happen. Even if this position is still controversial, the possibility of holding it would create an enormous further difficulty for the sort of analysis just *Received May, 1976.

Such an analysis would be complete only when it included a defense of the explanatory character of its kind of teleology. Fortunately, we need not consider this approach to the problem: Taylor and Wright both wish to uphold the causal relevance of the ends cited in teleological accounts. It is worth while to stress also that both writers attach special importance to the ability of most people to give, without hesitation and apparently just in response to observed facts, what seem to be teleological explanations. Wright points out in this connection that we are frequently able to give and to understand teleological explana- tions in situations where it would be extravagant to suppose that we are aware of all the laws and circumstances that would need to be cited in an alternative efficient causal or statistical explanation. If as Wright says, "the notion [of teleology] is interesting precisely because it functions so clearly in these contexts" ([4], p. 206), then another goal for the analysis of teleological explanation must be to capture the sense of these explanations just as they are understood in the everyday contexts referred to. So much in general. Let us now turn to Taylor's analysis of "B occurs for the sake of G." In the course of his discussion, Taylor in fact gives several formulations of his analysis, but I shall follow Wright in assuming that these are intended as variants of a single formula. First variant: "... when we say that an event occurs for the sake of an end, we are saying that it occurs because it is the type of event which brings about this end" ([2], p. 9). In other words, "B occurs for the sake of G" means "B happens because B-type events effectively cause G-type events." But Taylor immediately explains that "the condition of the event's occurring is that a state of affairs obtains such that it will bring about the end in question, or such that this event is required to bring about that end." In a footnote he says that the second disjunct of this elucidation is to be understood as differing from the first only insofar as it "adds that no other event [but B], or none other in the system concerned can bring it [G] about" ([2], p. 9). Thus we have: "B occurs for the sake of G" means either (i) "B happens because in the present circumstances a B-type event's happening will effectively cause a G-type event to occur" or (ii) "B occurs because in the present circumstances only a B-type event's happening will effectively cause a G-type event to occur." Taylor further states that a sufficient condition of a teleological kind 314</page><page sequence="3">ON TELEOLOGY AND ORGANISMS (he assumes that a cause must be a sufficient condition) can be found only if there is just one type of event which 'can' effectively cause the end-event to occur: he continues, if there are several possibilities we cannot account for the selection between them unless we add another teleological principle, e.g. of least effort. Since the putative teleological systems whose behaviour we shall be discussing in later parts of this book, i.e. organisms, seem to manifest some such principle, or else to select between alternatives when these are available in the repertoire on some other teleological principles, e.g. by certain standards which are norms to be observed, we shall generally assume the selection as made and speak elliptically of 'the event required for' the goal or end. ([2], p. 9) Clearly, if adherence to such teleological 'principles' is an evident feature of the behavior of organisms, this may hold the key to the special character of teleological accounts of their behavior. For it may be argued that only where we can nonarbitrarily describe B as the easiest or, in some other respect, the optimal way to effect G, can "B occurs for the sake of G " prove irreducible to nonteleological explanations of B's occurrence. This might be emphasized, for example, by those' who believe that only the behavior of organisms that can have intentions is irreducibly teleological, on the grounds that only for such organisms does there exist a firm distinction between various ways to achieve an end. By speaking of the means which requires least effort or which alone conforms to rules of conduct for the organism as being "required for" an end, Taylor perhaps diverts attention from this possibility. Yet all of his own examples of teleological behavior involve organisms that can have intentions. A third variant occurs in Taylor's summing up: "The element of 'purposiveness' in a given system . . . consists . . . in the fact that in beings with a purpose an event's being required for a given end is a sufficient condition of its occurrence" ([2], p. 10). As we have just seen, an event is required for a given end if it is the easiest means or the most acceptable by some other standard, according to the organism's reckoning. It is thus misleading for Wright to represent Taylor's view with the formula: "B occurs for the sake of G" means (i) B is necessary (required) for G to obtain; and (ii) B's being necessary for G is sufficient for B to occur; 'For example, G. H. von Wright who defends such a position in Parts II and III of [3]. 315</page><page sequence="4">STEPHEN UTZ although as Wright points out, Taylor appears to condone this way of stating his position.2 We shall see that Wright's objections to Taylor's analysis depend mainly on his neglect of Taylor's explanation of what "required for" means. Wright introduces his first objection by calling attention to a footnote in which Taylor denies that a means and the end for which it is required must be so related that if the means is adopted (and the appropriate behavior occurs), the end must eventually occur also. According to Taylor, failure of the end to occur after the means- behavior has occurred would not refute "B occurs for the sake of G" if the failure can "be cogently explained by interfering factors" ([2], p. 14). Consider a predator's stalking in order to find food. When Taylor speaks of interfering factors, he seems to have in mind something like the capture of the predator in a hunter's trap. But Wright suggests that instead of falling into a trap, the predator may stop stalking because he is tired, though he remains hungry and stalking is required still if he is to get food. In this case, according to Taylor's formula, we would have to say that the predator's getting tired was an interfering factor. But if he stopped merely to rest, then presumably he wasn't even trying to stalk (at that moment); and in order to explain the interruption by interference he must at least be trying. ([3], p. 208) This objection would be a strong one if to be 'required for' an end were simply, as Wright implies, to be the one and only sufficient condition for something's occurrence; but it is not. For one thing, a means can be required for a certain end even though there are other sufficient means of realizing that end. But more importantly, as Taylor states explicitly, what is required for an end will have to be selected, when there is a plurality of sufficient means, by reference to some additional teleological standards (of least effort, acceptable conduct, etc). If, as I have suggested, the influence of such additional teleological principles is an essential factor in teleological behavior, then it should also be clear that what matters is whether the organism reckons a B-type event to be sufficient to bring G about, not whether a B-type event is actually sufficient for G. We may accordingly explain Wright's example, compatibly with Taylor's analysis, by classifying it as an instance in which the organism first deems stalking to be the optimal sufficient means of accomplishing its end, then, when 2Wright points out that Denis Noble formulates Taylor's analysis in this way in [1], and that Taylor makes no comment on this in his reply. 316</page><page sequence="5">ON TELEOLOGY AND ORGANISMS tired, reviews its strategy and, using the new information it has acquired together with its original teleological principles, deems stalking- behavior-seasoned-with-rest to be what is required for the end of satisfying its hunger. To prevent further misapprehensions of Taylor's analysis, we should perhaps expand it, eliminating the phrase 'required for,' as follows: "B occurs for the sake of G" means (i) the organism selects B as the optimal behavior out of some range of behavior-types believed by it to be causally sufficient to realize G, and (ii) B's being selected is sufficient for B to occur. There is no special need for Taylor to be specific about what would count as interfering factors sufficient to explain the non-occurrence of G after B has taken place. The point is that B can occur for the sake of G even though G is in no circumstances brought about by B-type behavior. We may of course in many cases have no grounds on which to diagnose what a particular organism 'thinks' about the relation between various possible types of behavior and its ends, and in such cases teleological explanation would be entirely speculative and unempirical. Wright's second objection is also easily embodied in a putative counterexample. Suppose that our predator happens to do something, e.g. extend its claws while stretching, which as a matter of fact is sufficient to bring about its capturing its prey, although the predator does this without that end in view. Wright argues that if any sort of event which precludes G's occurrence can count as interfering between the occurrence of B and the occurrence of G, it will be impossible to adduce evidence to show that the predator's accidental behavior does not occur for the sake of catching food: for one might claim that 'barring interference' the accidental behavior occurs every time it is required for getting food ([4], pp. 208-209). Clearly, what matters is whether the organism reckons its behavior to be the best or the least exhausting or otherwise preferable way to its end. If Taylor were as blind to this as Wright takes him to be, the present counterexample would be sufficient to explode Taylor's analysis. But in order to defeat Wright's counterexample, it only needs to be pointed out that since the predator's extending his claws is assumed not to have been reckoned by the predator to be required for his end, the end would not in this case explain the behavior. The same sort of response is called for by Wright's third objection. The predator must now be supposed to have both the goal of finding food and that of finding water. He sees no water but does see an 317</page><page sequence="6">STEPHEN UTZ animal worth stalking, and so begins to stalk it. In the course of this activity he comes upon a water hole and drinks. At this point, Taylor's formula would require that we say the predator's behavior all along had been directed toward (i.e. for the sake of) obtaining water: Because he was thirsty: and he did just what what was required to get water; and, barring interference of the sort Taylor allows, going to water always obtains when it is required to satisfy thirst. ([4], p. 209; Wright's emphasis) Again, there is no problem if we distinguish, in the analysis of "B occurs for the sake of G," between what the organism believes to be the optimal sufficient means of securing the end and what is actually a sufficient way of securing it. The predator's stalking here would not be explained by its goal of satisfying its thirst since the predator cannot, as Wright implies, be correctly described as having reckoned the stalking to be required for the satisfaction of its thirst. Wright's fourth objection is on the same theme but more specialized. He calls attention to the contrast between functions and goal-directed activities. A function, such as that of sleep, may be required for an organism's ability to accomplish any of its ends. If the predator does not get enough sleep, it will cease to stalk efficiently. This also applies to most other goals the predator may have. "In other words, the requirement of sleep for these goals is (qualifiedly) sufficient to produce it" ([4], p. 209). Yet we do not want to say that the predator slept in order to catch its prey, slake its thirst, etc. Here too the best reply to Wright is that, according to his assumptions, the predator does not regard sleep as the optimal sufficient means of accomplishing its ends, and so cannot be said to sleep in order to accomplish them. That all of Wright's objections are concerned with a single aspect of Taylor's formulation is no accident. In a general comment Wright elaborates: Teleological behavior has [according to Taylor] what might be called a "requirement etiology": what brings it about is its being required. Moreover, in several places Taylor quite plausibly insists that it is often "perfectly observable" that a specific sort of behavior is what is required for a certain end. Often we can see what's required. So this seems to be an analysis of the sort we are looking for. . . . With a slight reworking and clarification [Taylor's analysis] will allow us to give an empiricist defense of several things quite generally disparaged by empiricists: final causation, anthropomorphism and teleological explanation not 318</page><page sequence="7">ON TELEOLOGY AND ORGANISMS reducible to an underlying, deterministic causal mechanism. ([4], p. 206) Thus it is Taylor's defense of the empirical import of teleological explanation that appeals to Wright, and this defense crucially depends on the observability, in certain instances, of what is required for a given end. Yet we may object to the requirement etiology that unless 'what brings it about is its being required,' in the passage quoted, means just that the organism engages in its behavior because that behavior seems to it the best way to realize one of its ends, the requirement etiology is wrong: sometimes organisms do things not because those things are actually sufficient to bring about a desired result but because what is done seems to the organism to be sufficient to bring about the desired result. The first condition of Taylor's analysis of "B occurs for the sake of G" in fact acknowledges this. Once this is emphasized, it becomes less certain that, as Taylor and Wright suppose, in some cases we can simply see what is required for a given end. In some cases it is plausible to identify what the experimenter regards as, for a given organism, the optimal or only sufficient means to some end with what the organism whose behavior is to be explained must regard as the optimal or only sufficient means. This sort of identification is taken for granted whenever "S does B for the sake of G" is taken to mean that B is required for G and that this relation of B to G is sufficient to cause B in the present circumstances. As experimenters, we sometimes take ourselves to be arriving at the same opinion of the usefulness of doing B, as the organism itself whose B-behavior is to be explained. It is clear, on the other hand, that organisms sometimes choose forms of behavior which are not, but are only considered by them to be, appropriate to their ends. The human experimenter can obviously find instances of this in his own behavior patterns. If Taylor's analysis were meant to overlook that point, we should have to abandon the analysis. I take it, however, that Taylor's gloss on 'required for' does acknowledge the fallibility of organisms in their practical reasoning. Now one of the purposes of Taylor's, and presumably of Wright's, concern with teleological explanation is to show that in some cases even the most scrupulous empiricist can accept teleological explana- tions. The sort of scruple that is most obviously to be considered involves scepticism as to the reliability of the evidence which the mere 'external' appearances of an organism afford concerning the organism's mental states and more particularly, its intentions. But we have seen that in order to decide what is 'required for' any of 319</page><page sequence="8">STEPHEN UTZ an organism's ends, we may have to assume knowledge of the organism's deliberations and allow for the possibility that the organism is 'mistaken' in its classification of some behavior-types as sufficient for certain of its ends. It may well be that observational evidence is quite adequate to establish beyond reasonable doubt that something is 'required' behavior in this sense for a given organism on some occasion. But Taylor's analysis merely takes it for granted that this is so; it does not shed new light on the evidential standards in question. Thus Taylor's analysis of "B occurs for the sake of G" does not provide a new argument against psychological behaviorism, but merely makes the old appeal to common sense which has so often failed to move the behaviorist. Taylor merely affirms, in other words, that we do know how to discern the intentions, beliefs, etc. of other organisms and that there is no reason why we should not rely on that ability in our attempts to explain their behavior.
