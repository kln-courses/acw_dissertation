<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERCEPTION, RECOLLECTION, AND DEATH 1 IN MEMORIAM: BERNHARD GROETHUYSEN What has perception to do with metaphysics ? What bearing has an analysis of perception, and its corollaries, recol lection and anticipation, upon the central question of meta physics, namely, the question of the nature of being ? More over, if perception and recollection are phenomenological con stituents of the concept of being, what is the meaning of death in the light of this constitution ? The following paper will deal with these questions, in an attempt to push forward to the structural elements of the idea of being. We shall begin with a hermeneutics of perception and recollection. Next we shall look into the problem of the object of recollection. The third part of the analysis will lead us into the prolegomena of a metaphysics of death; our purpose there will be to determine the interconnectedness of death and being. I PERCEPTION AS WILL TO ENDURE In a study on perception, Husserl, commenting on Brentano's theory of time, writes: "Each note has a temporal extension. When it is struck, I hear it as a now, but as it continues to sound, the now is continually renewed, and each preceding note becomes a thing of the past. Thus at any specific moment I hear only the actual phase of the note, and the whole tone in its objective duration forms an act-continuum, which is in part recollection, in an infinitesimal part perception, and in part, anticipation ... In every perception of temporal objects (all objects of perception are temporal objects ? they extend in time) perceptions and non-perceptions continually pass into 1 Read at the first meeting of The Metaphysical Society of America at Yale University on April 15, 1950. It contains parts of my forthcoming Freedom and Death. [13]</page><page sequence="2">14 Arnold Metzger one another and the now is nothing but an ideal limit toward which this continuum converges." 2 In other words, perception is constituted as a continual interweaving of the perceived and the non-perceived, of actu ality and non-actuality. In this interweaving, the actual, con summated, living now, which is linked with the continuum of the non-perceived and keeps it alive, itself coincides with death; and in this coincidence of life and death there emerges the primary recollection in the life of perception ? the will to preserve the dying instant. Although perception lives by the grace of the instant, the instant does not constitute its life. Perception as life, as experience, is duration. To experience or to live is to extend in time. To live is to transcend the instant, to struggle continuously against the sinking of the instant into nothingness. The instant is the ideal limit, the source of life, the source of its evidences, its original intuitions; but at the same time it submerges in the duration that extends beyond it and swallows it. Not the now of the instant forms the life of perception, but the continuum of cumulative recollec tions, anticipations (and hopes), which follow in the wake of the now and by picking it up integrate it into the total expe rience. We may say: in perception the will to endure or to be triumphs over the instant; or better: extending through time it is the primary medium in which the will to endure or con tinuity manifests itself. Each perception (cogitado, in the sense of Descartes) as such is a unit of duration; it is something self-contained ? perception of this tree before me, the melody I hear, etc. But now we see that this self-contained unit itself sinks into nothing ness, into the no-longer. And yet it does not sink into nothingness. It is recollected. When the last note of the melody is sounded, when we have reached the last now, all notes of the melody are, as it were, inwardly regathered. The dying now lives on transformed along with the whole chain of the primary recollections (retentions) and anticipations (pro tentions) preserved in it ? being a thing of the past it sur 2 E. Husserl, Vorl. zu Phaen. des innevn Zeitbewusstseins (Halle, 1928), pp. 385, 399.</page><page sequence="3">Perception, Recollection and Death 15 vives its death. It resurrects, so to speak, as it dies. Our life ? ego or existence aware of itself ? that strives for duration captures the dying instant. It reproduces it. Repro duction is what we properly call the act of recollection. The last note or last quarter-note of the song is struck. While it is still sounding and dying away it resurrects re-collected and lives on in the whole richness of its inner preserved possession ? and this continued life into the future is in fact the time continuum ? a continuous intercourse of recollection and anticipation, constantly interwoven with the dying instant. We say: what has been perceived passes into recollection. In recollection I inwardly rediscover what I "once" perceived. Perception is potential recollection. But what is "collected" in recollection is not only the whole of what I have just per ceived ? the Gestalt (tree) that has just been before my eyes ? but the very stream of primary anticipations and recol lections in which the whole was originally built. In the act of recollection I reproduce the retentional-protentional continuum of being, the stream which is a continuum transcending nothing ness. Being, in this primordial sense, is the continuum that holds in check and overcomes the continually invading nothing ness of the present. All the efforts of our existence aware of this invasion of death are aimed at the preservation of this continuum. II IDENTIFICATION AND REPETITION In my inwardness I rediscover what has died, and I rediscover it again and again, for recollective and anticipating life is endowed with the faculty of indefinite repetition. The fact that these two modes of duration can be indefinitely repeated is an essential characteristic of the recollecting anticipating process that is inextricably bound up with the dying instant. What is the relation between this repeatability of recol lection and anticipation on the one hand, and duration on the other ?</page><page sequence="4">16 Arnold Metzger By being perceived, the perceived content becomes object, i.e., it is recognized as the same in recollection. It becomes identified, or rather, the dying content is transformed into something that is identifiable. In being perceived the parti cular now is transformed into "always the same." What has died lasts as the identical. What has been experienced just now or in times past lives on in the acts of identification and re-identification. These acts constitute a dura tion of a second, higher order. Above the level of primary duration, primary experience-content, there forms the sphere of repeated and endlessly repeatable identification. Percep tions are recollected, in such a way that each act of recollec tion ? as though life were not satisfied with preserving the past only once ? projects a horizon of anticipation of ever renewed recollection of the same. What is recollected once, returns again and again. And it seems to me in this repetition of the same, this peculiar iterating of recollection and anti cipation, that human existence, i.e., existence aware of happen ing, primarily asserts itself against the nothingness of happening. The dying instant endures forever. For what has been is not merely what has in fact been recollected, but the eternally recollectable. Eternal duration consists in the indefinite repeat ability of recollection ? which is inseparable from anticipa tion of its repetition. The presence of eternity is inherent in each sensory presence. The horizon of permanent duration looms in the percept (perceptum), in the identical reproduc tion of the dying instant. The instant ? sensory presence ? is not pure impression, not pure event. Its content is not pure impressional datum. The problem of the sensory datum has time and again been falsely formulated in naturalistic (positivistic) psychology. The ques tion is not: What is sensation ? What is given ? The question is: What lies in sensory (empirical) seeing, touching, smelling, kinesthesia, in what we perceive and apprehend as phenomenon for us as perceiving existences and being aware of existence ? How does that which is given appear to him to whom it is given ?</page><page sequence="5">Perception, Recollection and Death 17 Human life is not a mechanism in which atomized data or even data combined into "Gestalt units" are associated in accordance with specific laws of mechanics. Life is affected by data, by contingencies. But it is not affected in the same way as one physical event is affected or caused by another. Our life responds to what affects it, or happens to it. A physical event is caused. But what is caused in human existence is not merely caused. To exist is to respond continuously. Existence aware of dying happening responds to happening. The impres sional datum enters into the dynamic system of intentional functions that makes this datum into an identical object. Through these functions our life affected by stimuli, circumstances or conditions enters into relation with the objective-identical world outside the stimulus-reaction mechanism. What is perceived is identically the same. It is incorporated into the universe of the recollecting-anticipating intentional life, that is, related to the identical. We may describe this situation as follows: In each per ception (cogitado) there flows the primordial source of all existence ? the will to endure. What enters into recollection are units of duration, units of events that continuously invade existence. As experience passes away, the particular loses its character of particularity, and the fundamental, the most magnificent of all phenomena takes places ? the transition to that which is opposed to the particularity of happening, the universal. In the abyss of oblivion there arises the process of renewing, repeating, recollecting. Happening loses its character of happening, fate loses its character of fate. The pain suffered, the misery endured, the fear that overwhelmed me, lose the character of the impressional. Each recollection is, to quote Goethe, "the god that bestowed upon me the gift of saying what I suffer." The specificity of human life consists in the fact that it continually transcends the impressional (and the mechanics of impressions). The pain that I feel is not merely the pain that I feel. Feeling it I am aware of it. Recollecting awareness is part of the sensation of it. Sensation is not iso lated. As I become aware of the pain, it enters into a greater</page><page sequence="6">18 Arnold Metzger totality. It is the familiar phenomenon to which I always return or can return, which is in communication with everything, which is, so to speak, at home everywhere. Once this pain has been felt, it has entered into the cosmos of the reproducible world. We are always beyond the particular. In the dying instant the present loses its character of a discontinuous irrupting event. Once it has been experienced, the instant loses this isolated character. Content becomes object. Each particular is a poten tial object. The present is re-presented. To represent means both to recollect the identical and to anticipate repetition of the recollected. Thus representing, the present life moves toward the coming event, the irrational. But even before the coming event materializes, we are prepared to respond to it, within our own frame of reference. Human existence is not a tabula rasa, it is not thrust into impending death. It is not at the mercy of the outside. It is not at the mercy of "circum stances." It is not "cast" into happening. Before the future is here, it is already harnessed to the possible repetitions and anticipations that respond to it intentionally, receive it, and divest it of its irrationality. Freedom from fate and representation are correlated. In awareness of the dying instant arises freedom from it. It seems to me that the category of representation with reference to the vanishing now is of basic importance as regards the origin of the idea of freedom. Whatever may be said about freedom and the variants of this concept, it is rooted in the awareness of death and in the will to endure that arises out of this aware ness. The will to freedom and the will to endure are interre lated. Recollection and anticipation are its primary elements. A theory of perception, i. e., the response in which life raises its first voice against death, is an integral part of any meta physics of freedom. Ill THE OBJECT OF RECOLLECTION Let us take a further step in the hermeneutics of recollected perception. Perception is accompanied by the inner awareness</page><page sequence="7">Perception, Recollection and Death 19 of it. We not only perceive, we also know, explicitly or not, that we perceive. The dual life of perception is characterized by the fact that it is not confined to itself. Perception goes beyond the immanent current of perceiving life. It transcends that which is given in perception. It transcends the perception contents. It is directed toward something that is not itself. Perceiving, we live in something that goes beyond the factual life contents. The peculiar, one might say dialectical, nature of perceiving life implies that what we live, the stream of our experiences, is not what we imagine while we experience it. Perception is the perceiving of something beyond perception. It is perception of this beyond. Transcendence, in this sense, is an attribute of perception which is accompanied by self awareness. What is the true meaning of this transcendence of recollected perception ? What is the object, the terminus of its transcendence ? In the Sophist Plato explains that recollection (thought, judgment) is recollection of the One in the Many and of the Many in the One.3 In the Meno 4 it is stated: "True opinions have value only when established through thinking knowledge of the (first) cause. But this is recollection." In the end we recollect that which transcends all factual connections. It is as though the will to endure, in its increasing ly intense efforts to achieve the goal of its longing ? freedom from the dying, the particular, freedom from non-being ? ends only when it comes to rest in the recollection of that object which has left all happening behind it, and has brought it to unity in the all-embracing cause. We recollect the One; in the diverse we recollect diversity, in the identical and similar we recollect identity and similarity, in counting we recollect Number. In the perception of the particular and many we recollect the universal and the One. In recollection we reach out beyond all actuality into the realm of the possible. In it we anticipate that which makes actuality possible. The will to endure, in its acts of reproduction, does not confine itself to reproducing that which we have in fact, 3 352A-E. 4 98A.</page><page sequence="8">20 Arnold Metzger consciously, unconsciously or subconsciously, experienced or will experience. Each time we become aware of the passing now, we so to speak anticipate the last potential now of the hour of death and reach into the totality which leaves behind all actual happening, which anticipates and unites all possible happening ? the cause of being, that which Plato calls the ob ject of anamnesis. Let us first dwell on the concept of the Platonic anamnesis. To recollect, we read in Meno, is to rediscover what we have lost. Recollection is the process of recalling the forgotten. The illiterate slave, the non-mathematician, is called by Socrates to take part in discussions on mathematical objects. The boy does not know geometry but he can be induced to achieve geometric insights. Socrates traces diagrams (rec tangles) in the sand. Aside from technical hints he gives no information to the boy. The ignorant slave is supposed to dis cover by himself geometrical truths (concerning certain ratios between the diagonal and the sides of the rectangle). The pupil is directed only by questions. After some initial errors that he himself corrects, he finds the right answer. Here Socrates probes the nature of a recollection that is not enriched by any outside content ? although this recollec tion is awakened from the outside by the sight of a sensory content. The functions of recollection are set in motion by sensory data. The senses are pregnant with forgotten truths. The sense datum is more than a sense datum. As the slave perceives the figure in the sand, he recollects certain propor tions "from within" ( e? eavrov ). Equal or similar sense experiences suggest ideal, or better, identical standards to which the contents of experience do not correspond adequately. When we see a straight line we know about the ideal straight line, and we know at the same time that "the" straight line is not adequately given in sensation, but only illustrated. We measure sense experience by the concept that it contains but that it is not itself. Sense experience implies intelligible order, but, as Leibniz put it, this order is only confusedly contained in the perceived content.</page><page sequence="9">Perception, Recollection and Death 21 It is not recollection of accumulated empirical life that is here associated with perception. Plato teaches us here in the form of theological Pythagorean reminiscences of the divine origin of the soul that the perceptions (and not only perceptions that underlie the study of mathematical objects) open to us the horizon of ideal relationships. We not only identify and re-identify that which we have just perceived, but we place this identical content of reproduction in an invariable system. We respond to the variable by potential connections, i. e., con nections that are valid not only for this variable but for every possible individual content of the same type. We transcend time and happening in time in the very act of perception. To perceive means ultimately to recollect the beyond time. What does this concept of the timeless mean in the process of recollection ? The instant vanishes. It survives in recol lection. What primarily is it that vanishes and then survives ? It is the concrete world that I associate with it. What I recol lect is not merely the whole or a part of the melody that I have just heard. What has vanished into the past is the whole of my subjective and intersubjective past life. What vanishes with the dying instant is the whole concrete world that has come down to us, that is attached to the living now which keeps it in impressional motion ? the whole burden of my traditional heritage whose dimensions of depth were pointed out by Freud. While I see this specific green on this specific tree, it is not only the what-content of this green that I recollect when I return to it. Forgotten, formerly perceived, anticipated, desired, hoped-for or feared things emerge. It is always the whole universe that grows, changes and ages with every perception ? my universe, my whole experienced and anticipated world ? that enters into the actual perception. Each sensory (acoustic, visual, etc. ) element is associated with the entire sensory world or with the quasi-sensory world of imagined possibilities. Each sensation is a monad, each perception a complex monad which combines sensations into a unity of duration. Each instant is burdened by associations. It includes recollected and antici pated time (and space) ?' my whole life with its past and future.</page><page sequence="10">22 Arnold Metzger We do not only associate the familiar (as David Hume thought), but we associate a specific smell of a flower or a specific taste of a food with the unfamiliar. Freud carried Hume's thought further by showing that the vanishing instant is charged with associated unconscious and subconscious ele ments. The now of perception is charged as it were with the previously experienced universe in which conscious associations or ideas occupy only a small superficial sector. This is the concrete world, the continually changed and changing concrete universe, that I carry with me in each instant, recollecting and hoping. But now we see that above these acts of awareness there rises a new dimension of awareness. The slave recollects the rules, the proportions. Confronted with the multiplicity and particularity of phenomena he recol lects that which "combines phenomena into unity." We might say, he transforms the particulars into examples or illustrations of a universal that is indefinitely reproducible in particulars. "Wherever I may find these figures of Socrates," he might say, "the ratio between the diagonal and the sides of the rectangle will be the same." This is the amazing thing. Perception enters into partner ship with recollection. But the term "recollection" is equivocal. Recollection traverses dimensions. The process of recollection is dynamic. Recollection does not merely enter into and re produce the world of concrete past occurrences. Reproduction does not merely go back in time, and we not only anticipate things to come in the near future or hope for objects at the end of time. In its ultimate dimensions recollection breaks through time. The slave becomes aware of possible, invariable propor tions that pretend to bear upon the whole of time. Recollection breaks through the contingency of perception. Its immense dynamic realm lies between the melody I have heard, the drawing I have seen and recollect, on the one hand, and the invariable on the other hand. It is as though recol lection ultimately took up its position behind time, following its tendency to duration. Plato speaks of the recollection "from within." Kant (in his inaugural dissertation of 1770) speaks of the a priori or of that which is menti insitum. Descartes (2nd</page><page sequence="11">Perception, Recollection and Death 23 Meditation) refers to that which remains the same throughout the "infinite variations" of perceptions. All these are para phrases of the same phenomenon. We must avoid all anthropomorphism in interpreting this phenomenon. The term "from within" does not refer to an innate possession of man, it means something that we discover in the inventory of perception. The slave questioned by So crates "discovers" the invariable in the variable. He reveals hidden truths. He makes the hidden un-hidden ( a-X^oc? ). The act of revealing the invariable in the variable is ultimately recollection. But this invariable does not stand here only for the identical qualia into which the contents of perception change in being reproduced and identified, it stands rather for the relational system of these qualia, the timeless macrocosm of possibilities (ideas), into which the vanishing now is drawn by the dynamic of the reproductive process. In the present is represented the whole of all possibilities, the One encompassing Being. IV THE EX-CENTRICITY OF BEING Perception and One Being are-correlates.5 What is the authentic meaning of the concept of One Being ? What is the meaning of the basic unity of perception, recollection and be ing ? And what is the place of death in this unity ? We have seen that our waking life is a continuum com bining constant recollection and constant anticipation, into which happening ? birth and death of the instant ? constantly breaks in. But perceiving existence is more than that continuum. It has direction. Life has direction. It runs into something that "stands against it," as Kant says. What is against it are not only objects, things which are perceived, but the one ob ject. We say that the intentionality of perception not only hits 5 Kant once pointed out that imagination (representation) is a "neces sary ingredient" of perception {Critique of Pure Reason, 1st Edition, p. 121, footnote). This is another paraphrase of the correlation of perception and being.</page><page sequence="12">24 Arnold Metzger upon objects, concrete things, but extends beyond the multi plicity of things. What is in fact this terminus of intentionality ? It is the indeterminate, indeterminable, "the" object, to which Kant refers as the X, the One of Platonic anamnesis, which causes us, to quote Kant again, "to combine all the multiple into one object by means of common functions." We might say: Existence ? the will to endure ? is not only intentional, it is ex-centric (to use Scheler's term). It determines itself in its perceiving-recollecting-anticipating unity by this something toward which it strives, and which transcends everything that it ever perceives or experiences, all its immanent and intentional data. Perception is ex-centric because recol lection and hope, the media of its yearning for the One, are ex-centric. Therefore its correlate is not an object in the logical sense, not a "subject of possible predicates," not a predicable. The One transcends all predicates (properties, attributes); it is emptied of these material contents. This One we call "being." Being is not an object, not an existent. We have to dist inguish between being and the existent. What unites existences is beyond the existent. Nor can being be described as an intui tive entity, neither as a subject nor as a substance. It cannot be hypostatized. Perhaps one of Plato's most fateful errors is this ? that having established the transcendence of Being, he later made Being a substance (thing). The transcendent relapses into immanence. What is beyond ousia becomes again ousia. But being has no "supracelestial place," because it has no place at all. Therefore Aristotle (Met. A 986a 19-20) says of Plato's One that it is not a number (as the Pythagoreans thought), but the formal principle of number. Being is the defining present in the existent. Ousia is par ousia (presence). But being present it is nowhere. What Cusanus said concerning the relation between God and the created world applies to be ing: "Thou doth not desert thy creatures, but thou doth not accompany them either" (De visione Dei, xv). We can describe the ex-centricity of being in still an other way. Being is a relational concept, the name for the relation of termini (relata), but in such a way that each expli cation, each relation connecting S and P, forms the beginning</page><page sequence="13">Perception, Recollection and Death 25 of a system of transcending relations. The P of each S is con stantly broken through. In other words, in each "S is P," in every type of universals, recollection of the ex-centric ? the transcendent in this sense ? is implicated: the recollection of the last unifying identical "object," which is associated with every sensory experience. But, again, being, the relational concept, cannot be reduc ed simply to relations, as Hegelian and Neo-Kantian idealism maintains by identifying being with the system of relations or the invariables that express this system in categories. Being is the ideal limit ? toward which the process, uniting the multiple and transcending each particular unification, converges. But that toward which the process converges is not identical with the process itself. Being, we read in the Sophist,? is power (dynamis). It is the power that defines ex-centrically the whatness (quidditas) of each existent. It is the recollected or anticipated possibility of the existent that de-termines the existent. We say: everything that exists has a being-so (quidditas, essence), and a being-there (somewhere and at some time). Everything that exists is the meeting-place in which essence and existence encounter one another. Each that has a specific what. But the what (regardless of its degree of universality) does not define the that. In each whatness (essence) is impli cated a more universal whatness, finally the one being. In each eidos the ousia is present. In each form lives the superform. The difference between essence and existence, which has occu pied metaphysics so often and so fruitlessly, recedes behind the more fundamental difference between the many existences and the many essences on the one hand, and the one being on the other. The polarity of being and the existent pervades all things. It is this polarity, and not that of essence and existence, that is the backbone of metaphysics. Being is ex-centric. The recollection of it is implicitly associated with each experience, not merely with the sensory experience (perception) in the specific sense. Each experience 6 247B.</page><page sequence="14">26 Arnold Metzger is "directed toward" ? evaluation toward the thing that is evaluated, feeling toward the object felt, willing toward the object willed. But experiences are directed in such a way that they are directed beyond the object loved or evaluated each time. In evaluating, feeling, and loving we actually or poten tially recollect the remote ideal limit of unity. We are always beyond what we have. The important thing here is that not only our experiences but also the experienced objects are accom panied by the ex-centric horizon. The object evaluated in evaluation, loved in love, is something dynamic itself. In each loved thing or person the recollection of the most remotely loved is co-present. In each evaluated thing the yardstick of the highest value is co-present. The object itself has the char acter of no?matic intentionality. Each experience has the character of a mere phase. Not only each particular object, but the world as the totality of ob jects, is a fragment. In this sense we speak of longing (desid erium) as the primal category of all existent. The existent is yearning for the collecting one object.7 In this sense Kant speaks of the synthesis of the multiple in regard to the identical object of apperception ~* the anticipated totality that encom passes all essences and all existences. V DEATH - WILL - BEING Only if we understand the ex-centricity of being do we understand the metaphysical (and I believe also the religious) problem of death. Being and death are interrelated. 7 See the definition of the one object (the good) in the new book by Professor Weiss, Mans Freedom: "Unlike preference and choice and the acts these promote, the will has no preassignable specific objective to vivify. What we creatively will to bring about achieves its specific nature in being brought about. The creative will produces it by making determinate that radically indeterminate good which is the future of all beings in such a way as to make it possible for them to be so many different versions of a single harmony" (p. 228).</page><page sequence="15">Perception, Recollection and Death 27 Two questions arise: (1) What has the experience of death to do with the life stream constituted by perception, re collection and anticipation ? and ( 2 ) What is the meaning of death in regard to the idea of being ? We may speak of death in a twofold sense ? death as the constant accompaniment of our life, and death as the end of life. Death determines life, not only because it is the end of life, but because life is constantly ending. It is ceasing at every moment. The present tonstantly breaks in and the moment it is, it is no longer. We live no longer living. Life is continually accompanied by dying present. Life is the dying present, but this continual accompaniment itself dies in the end. The living death ceases and life ceases: these two expressions mean one and the same thing. Thus death doubly determines life. We say that life endures, that it extends in time. It continues beyond the present and projects the past into the future. But into this process continually linking the past and the future, the now irrupts constantly ? the dying now, the passing instant. We are constantly dying, but as we die we come to life again and what we call the living continuum, the continuum of time, is actually the continuum of death and resurrection, in which resurgent life recollects what it was before dying and enters, anticipating and hoping, into new duration, into the future. Time is originally ? and each analysis of time must begin at this point ? the dialectical interaction of death and resur rection. Resurrection itself is pure nowness. Death clings to it. Life resurrects and dies. But recollection is more than pure nowness: the now is anticipating and hoping. It is the horizon of recollection and hope that, extending infinitely in both time directions, sinks together with the dying resurrection and rises together with the resurrecting now. It is as though the now, to use Aristotle's word, were "suspended" in the universe, the universe of time. ? a permanent involutio pr teritorum et futurorum (Chr. Wolff). Death is continually swallowing the now. The no-longer continually clings to the now. But the horizon of eternal return</page><page sequence="16">28 Arnold Metzger just as continually clings to the no-longer. And this return is more than a coming back, more than a returning now. It is recollection and hope. Each now has a place in the horizon of time. This horizon is part of its self-awareness. What has died is not forgotten. It lives over and over again in varied and repeated recollections; and it lives beyond the recollection of it, so to speak drawing into its death the hope of return. But at a certain point the end comes. The now freezes. The prototype of death is the frozen now. It is the freezing that is continually heralded in the decaying now of the life stream. In the end the now is overcome by decay. In the end there is irretrievable oblivion. Oblivion denotes a quality of the now: the now without the time dimensions of recollection and hope, or the now that is no longer aware of itself. The dead are without recollection or hope. They are cast out, as it were, from that continuum of recollecting-anticipating, i.e., historical time. The now is isolated ? is frozen particularity removed from the life stream of resurrection: it is the homeless instant, the other. We may also say that in death time becomes space. At a certain point the river into which we can never step twice changes into ice. Life stands still. The now has become solid. The now extends. Time becomes space. In death, time be comes space or space-time. Space is the now minus recurrent resurrection. It is the endlessly extended now, void of recol lection, the sphere of mere happening, of events, of endless oblivion. The opposite of life, says Plato in Phaedo, is oblivion. The dead are without recollection. In the Gorgias oblivion, impulses, and death are interconnected. Death (existence of the dead) is a kind of existence that is no longer aware of itself, i. e., existence without recollection or hope, without the intentional object of these modes of yearning awareness, with out the whole and the one. Death is the standstill of the inten tionality that points beyond the vanishing now. "The dead do not praise the Lord." "For the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot</page><page sequence="17">Perception, Recollection and Death 29 hope for thy truth." 8 Death is the pure particularity of the particular. In a more fundamental sense we may now say that percep tion is the act in which the fact of dying is continually trans cended. In perception, existence, aware of death, manifests its will against death. Perceiving life is answer to death. Answer to death is an answer against death. Life is a counter movement to death. Life is not characterized only by its fini tude, by its anxious fear of death, but by the fact that it trans cends its power. Not fear of death is the fundamental category of existence, as Heidegger says, but the will to freedom from death. Recollection, anticipation and hope are the attributes of this primordial category of will. They stand against oblivion. The will to continuity stands against the dying particular. This is a remarkable fact: above the sphere of mortality there rises the realm of continuity. But in itself, this realm, although tending to permanence, is restless. The will to endure does not become stabilized, does not come to an end. Its longing transcends any fixed stabilization, any opus operatum. One might say that the will is motivated by something that is not itself. It is motivated by the object toward which it is directed. Yet the object rebounds toward it. The will does not come to rest until it reaches the ultimate object: the undefin able being. To sum up: in our analysis we have tried to discover the constituents or structural elements of being, because being ? the Oneness ? is a complex notion and the metaphysician should regard it as his essential task to discover the constituents of this complexity. We discovered that oneness, creative will and death are interconnected. This triad of elements stands for being. It is not enough to oppose being to nothingness and vice versa, as is done traditionally. We must add to this polarity a third element ? namely the will. There is not a concept of being without the experience and the concept of death and 8 Isaiah, 38: 18.</page><page sequence="18">30 Arnold Metzger without the will against death. Human life in its will against death is will to endure and the one being. Life of man, death, and being form an inseparable structural unity. Perceiving we live, constantly transcending the given con tents, driven by that which cannot materialize but which in its very impossibility makes possible the perceiving-thinking acting will that rises against the dying particular. Knowing of the changeable we are motivated by the unchangeable. Dying we live by our knowledge of immortality. Aware of life as finite we live by that which is beyond the finite. Life of man in its answer to death transcends itself in the object that it sets before itself. Arnold Metzger Cambridge, Mass. The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. IV, 1, September 1950.</page></plain_text>
