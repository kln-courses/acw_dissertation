<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS The Planetesimal Hypothesis and the Solar System. By HARRY FIELDING REID. American Journal of Science (January, 1924), pp. 37-64. A footnote to the title reads as follows: Professor F. R. Moulton has been kind enough to read over my manuscript and to make some suggestions which I have incorporated in the text. I am especially indebted to him for pointing out an error, which has led to a much better treatment of the satellites. It is quite certain that Dr. Moulton's relations to this paper will be misunderstood if the additional factors of the case are not known. A paper similar to this one in import-and doubtless an earlier edition of it-was presented at the Amherst meeting of the Geological Society of America in 1921 but was not published in the Bulletin of that Society. A few months later a paper of similar nature was offered for publication to an appropriate, but not geological, journal and was referred by its editor to Moulton as an advisory expert. Moulton transmitted his comments to Reid as well as to the editor, and the paper was withdrawn for correction, but was not returned for publication. It now appears in the American Journal of Science as indicated above. This covers the whole of Moulton's relations to the paper. The article is an attempt to point out certain supposed errors or defects in the planetesimal hypothesis. In a critique of this kind the first wish of the right-minded reader is to learn with what fidelity the essential postulates, spirit, and method of the hypothesis are put before him as a basis for his judgment of the validity of the criticisms offered. His second interest lies in the scrupulousness with which these are adhered to in the discussion of the hypothesis. DERIVATIVES INSTEAD OF FUNDAMENTALS Immediately after the Introduction, Reid characterizes the hypothe- sis as follows: The Planetesimal Hypothesis.-The hypothesis proper assumes a central sun around which were revolving, in the same general direction, a large number of very small planetesimals, and a smaller number of nuclei. The orbits were in 242</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS various planes, of various sizes and in general of large eccentricities. .... There follows the enumeration of a score or so of similar particulars stated in like terms [p. 38]. Now these are all secondary features, as may be seen from the state- ment itself, in which, at the very outset, planetesimals and nuclei are mentioned. These are not primary postulates but derivatives from the true basal hypothesis. They will mislead if regarded as the basal hypoth- esis itself. The fundamental postulates of the hypothesis lie back of these secondary deductions. The latter should take shape from the basal postulates as natural and necessary derivatives from them, but mis- takes may be made in deriving them which do not vitiate the funda- mental postulates. The relation is thus put: "Given these postulates, the rest of the evolution is predetermined."' These secondaries are, of course, open to criticism, but as such criti- cism may, or may not, affect the fundamentals, it must be shown that the latter stand or fall with the validity of the secondaries criticized, before any basal weakness can be shown. In building these secondaries many tentative postulates were thrown out to give place to better ones. And so, if Reid has shown that any which remain are weak or untenable, he may be only carrying this constructive work further. At any rate, he must show that the secondaries criticized are vital to the primary postulates. The real issue therefore hangs on the validity of the basal postulates. This opening statement is put in such general terms, in certain respects, as to give the impression that the particular "assumptions" named were chosen or might be chosen ad libitum. This is implied by such expressions as "orbits in various planes" and "of various sizes" (p. 38) quoted above. To catch the spirit and method of the hypothesis, it is important to observe that these secondaries are not "assumptions" in a free sense at all, but are results of studied efforts to deduce from the primary postulates what the sequences must be. The planetesimal hypoth- esis is far from being a free speculation; it may almost be said to have been forced to be what it is by the facts disclosed in a long previous patient and critical study of the significant dynamical features of our planetary system. The primary postulates are as completely dependent on these disclosed facts of the system as the secondaries are dependent on these primary postulates. Criticism is sure to go amiss if it does not deal with the hypothesis as a logical chain tied to the most significant features of the planetary system. Reid's phrase, " the hypothesis proper," x The Origin of the Earth, 1916, p. 145. 243</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS made the keynote of his paper, should have been replaced by some such phrase as " secondary features of the planetesimal hypothesis." A FUNDAMENTAL MISCONCEPTION It is only on the next to the last page of Reid's paper (p. 63) that the reader is brought into touch with the fundamental features of the plane- tesimal hypothesis, and then only in a most surprising way. It is there said: There is another phase of the planetesimal hypothesis which ascribes the origin of the nuclei [planetesimals not mentioned] to the near approach of a star to the sun; but this is not considered as a necessary part of the hypothesis. This last clause is most astonishing, since the close approach of a star (or its equivalent) to the sun is the very soul of the planetesimal hypothe- sis. Either by explicit statement or obvious implication this postulate permeates the whole mass of authoritative literature on the subject. That misapprehension on such a radical point should obtain in such a quarter shows the inherent difficulty of making clear and lastingly impres- sive such intangible features as dynamic properties even when most essen- tial and significant in nature. It furthermore makes clear the necessity not only of emphasizing the foregoing distinctions but of reciting in this connection as briefly as may be the fundamental features of the hypothe- sis, and of doing this in such a way as to show as vividly as may be their dependencies on the critical facts of the planetary system; otherwise the discussion of criticisms founded on a very different understanding cannot be free from confusion of thought. THE TRUE BASAL HYPOTHESIS As already indicated, the hypothesis was dictated by the revelations of a critical study of the mass distribution and dynamical properties of our planetary system.' This preliminary study, initiated with no thought 'T. C. Chamberlin, "An Attempt to Test the Nebular Hypothesis by the Rela- tions of Masses and Momenta," Jour.

As early as 1861, Babinet, in Comptes Rendus, Vol. LII (I86i), p. 481, called attention to the moment of momentum of the solar system as offering objections to the centrifugal class of theories, but he does not seem to have abandoned the Laplacian hypothesis on that account. The work of Moulton and Chamberlin was altogether independent of this, which only came to their notice after earlier results were in print. 244</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS of a new hypothesis, ran through about seven years and became an asso- ciated inquiry as indicated by the references cited. The disclosure of these critical features forced the rejection of all hypotheses of the self- generative type, because there was clear evidence of two hereditary strains, in other words, of a bi-parental origin. This is not a general proposition applying to all secondaries of stars; it is simply a specific statement relating to our planetary system, and is supported by rigorous mechanical considerations. While significant peculiarities are found in many fea- tures of our planetary system, there is room here to cite only the simplest, but this happens to be the most comprehensive. Ninety-eight per cent of the angular moment of momentum of the system is carried by less than one-seventh of I per cent of the total mass, while only 2 per cent' is carried by the remaining 699/700 of the mass. The minute fraction of the mass so highly endowed with momentum forms the planets. It shows that dynamically they belong to a distinctive strain. The great mass carrying the very small momentum forms the sun and constitutes a different dynamic strain. Thus the problem of genesis at once resolves itself into the heredity of these two strains. At the same time, there was abundant evidence that the planets were the offspring of the sun, and that they all belonged to the same brood. The differences in the endowments of the sun, and of the planets, respec- tively, were thus regarded as hereditary traits such as distinguish a mother from her offspring. The added qualities of the offspring, there- fore, become pointers to the other parent. They are the vestiges that give distinction to the pedigree. The other parent must have been one that could impart an extraordinary amount of revolutional energy and momentum to a very small, scattered fraction of the system's mass, while the main mass was left with only a sluggish rotation. What was needed to meet the requirements of the case was a dynamic encounter by which the requisite energy and momentum would be imparted. There must also be an extraordinary separative action, for the very high endowments of energy and momentum affected only 1/700 of the total mass, and this portion was scattered out to great distances from the sun, distances ranging up to three billion miles. With this groundwork of facts and close inference from the facts, it is not difficult to see why the passage of a ' Exactness of percentage has no importance here of itself, but it may be worth while to state that the data used are derived from Sir George Darwin's tables, and that, if the distribution of density of the sun be supposed to follow Laplace's law of density, the momentum of the sun is less than 2 per cent; if the density is supposed to be dis- tributed uniformly from center to surface, which is wholly improbable, the percentage is less than 3 per cent. Two per cent is therefore used as the nearest round number. 245</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS strong attracting force suggested itself or why a passing star seemed to embody such a force. The known eruptivity of the sun would seemingly be stimulated and directed by the differential attraction of the star. These were therefore adopted as the co-operating dynamic factors of the case. It then remained to connect the dynamic encounter of the stars with the observed planetary results by logical intermediary steps. The stand- ard geological method of tracing events back to their antecedents is one of the surest and best of methods. Starting with the planetary bodies and observing that they form a disk of far-flung bodies, it was a simple first step to suppose that they had previously been a somewhat more scattered disk of still smaller bodies. It was necessary, however, that the dynamic properties of the planetary system should be kept in the disk of smaller bodies. This was crucial, and this led to a parting of the ways. While these assigned bodies were small, resembling meteorites, they could not be meteorites in the proper sense of the term, for meteorites revolve in practically all planes and in both directions in those planes. Their courses are forward, retrograde, and oblique in various degrees. When they fall into a planet, they add a little to its mass, indeed, but they tend to kill its revolutionary or planetary motion because of their conflicting direc- tions of motion. Now revolutionary motion is a distinctive feature of our planets, and in our family of planets the orbits lie in or near a common plane, and the revolution is in the same direction in all the planets. These general features, and the mechanics involved in them, are unquestionable. The infall of meteorites is adverse to this. While this has long been recognized in itself, the inconsistency of assigning the origin of planets to meteorites has not been equally appreciated. The slow rotation of the sun gives remarkably clear and concrete testimony on this point. It is agreed on all hands that meteorites are now plunging into the sun and have been doing so throughout the past ages, and yet the sun has only the very low rotatory momentum cited above. Whatever it inherited from primitive conditions must be counted in also. The sun's rotational momentum is only about one-thirtieth of the amount carried by the single planet, Jupiter. As already noted, because meteorites revolve in all directions and in all azimuths, they destroy one another's contribution to the normal motion of the planet into which they fall. They thus are to be classed dynamically as planet-killers, in their little way. A system so extraordi- narily endowed with planetary momentum as ours could scarcely be built up of planet-killers of this type, and so meteorites were necessarily excluded from the new hypothesis-except as interfering incidents. The small 246</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS bodies must, to fit the case, have had motions concurrent with one another and the planets-to-be, in nearly parallel orbits, so related that they would combine their momenta as they gathered into the planetary bodies. Thus there arose from the strict logic of the case the planetesimal concept. The name was adopted, in spite of its length, as a constant signal of the absolutely essential distinction between them and the diversely moving meteorites. This concurrent or planetesimal mode of revolution was found to be assignable to a star passing at considerable distance from the sun, but sufficiently near to stimulate, by its differential attraction, the great eruptive forces in the sun to project the small fraction of the sun's sub- stance needed (1/700) far out into space, while the passing star drew this projected matter forward in the line of its own motion. This gave a disk-like form to the planetesimals as a group. And when they were later gathered into planets, the latter retained the disk-like grouping. The plane of the group did not happen to be the plane of the sun's former rotation, and the residue of this discrepancy remains in the present obliq- uity of the sun's plane of rotation to the invariable plane of the planets. The direction of the sun's previous rotation was probably different from the present direction, but this cannot be discussed here.' The spirit, the method, and the essentials of the planetesimal hypoth- esis are thus definable simply as attempts to trace back logically the significant features of the solar system to an event certain to happen in the natural course of things. The method and the postulates should be perfectly clear if the planetary features are first made clear. The hypoth- esis maintains that the planets had a bi-parental origin, that the sun was one partner, a passing star (or its equivalent) the other, that the disk of planetesimals and nuclei was the result of their dynamic encounter, and that the planets are only a simple, natural evolution from the nuclei and planetesimals so formed. The essentials are so obvious when looked at from the imperative requirements of the planetary system as revealed in its most significant features that a critic ought not to go astray, if he once catches the philosophy of the hypothesis. REID ON PLANETARY ROTATION Though Reid falls much short of grasping clearly the fundamentals of the planetesimal hypothesis, some of his criticisms call for careful con- sideration, for they relate to features of importance even though they are not basal. His first challenge of the hypothesis is directed against the ' See The Origin of the Earth, 1916, pp. 130-32. 247</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS competency of the infalling planetesimals to give to the planets their actual rotations. Criticism on this point comes with the special interest of surprise, for the protagonists of the hypothesis regard the facility with which it explains the actual rates of rotation (often low or moderate and never extremely high) as one of its strong points. Hypotheses that appeal to centrifugal separation involve very high rates of rotation, at least of all the planets that have satellites. The reduction of these high speeds to the observed rates of rotations has always been a grave difficulty with those hypotheses. As the planetesimal hypothesis builds up rotation little by little as growth goes on, while the forming rotation is affected by both checking and accelerating processes, it has been held to be peculiarly adapted to explain the varying rotations observed. As Reid's discussion implies, moment of momentum is the most convenient criterion for testing the effects of planetesimal infall. Although he uses the phrase a score of times, he nowhere makes it clear to the reader that the moment of momentum involved in the case has two phases, namely, the moment of momentum of rotation (as of the nuclei or planets) and the moment of momentum of revolution (as of the plane- tesimals or of the orbital motions of planets). These two forms are transformable into one another. They are undergoing interchange even now. A comparison of these is the best first step in the discussion of the competency challenged, for it shows the degree of transformation required. The earth's moment of momentum of revolution about the sun is 3,700,000 times that of its rotation on its axis (Moulton). To try to prove by special artificial cases, necessarily both complicated and lim- ited, treated by complicated mathematical processes affected by tedious integrations, that a three-millionth part of the moment of momentum of the planetesimals could not be transformed into rotational moment of momentum by their infall into the growing nucleus, was certainly a most courageous undertaking; and as hopeless as it was courageous. We lift our hat. We do this the more complacently because Reid covers the whole issue in the following frank admission: There is one way, however, by which the proper moment of momentum might have been obtained and the earth still grow up as a solid body. Suppose the mass of the nucleus was only a small fraction of that of the present earth but that it occupied an enormous space. The infall of a comparatively small mass of planetesimals might then have given it as much moment of momentum as the earth now has. . . .. This would meet the situation, but it has nothing to commend it except that it offers a way, though a highly artificial one, out of the difficulty [p. 48]. 248</page><page sequence="8">RE VIEWS The error here relates to the artificiality of this case; it is, in its essen- tials, the real case and the only one to be considered. This has been set forth rather pointedly in the literature of the planetesimal hypothesis. That the mass of the nucleus of the earth was relatively small has been shown to be inevitable from the conditions of the case by a close concrete analysis of its mode of formation.' It is further shown, there and else- where,2 that the successive spheres of control of the earth nucleus as it grew would range from diameters of 500,000 miles, at first, to 1,500,000 at maturity. It is still further shown, in the quotation below, that the whole sphere of control serves as a collecting area. In addition to these special treatments, an elaborate discussion of the segregations and physi- cal phases of the planetary nuclei during their formative stages has been given in a recent extended discussion of the hypothesis. The following specific description sets forth the leading features of the collecting process:3 The gathering of the orbital part of the knots, the satellitesimals, into the planetary and satellite cores, was doubtless a slower process, for it depended, in part, on the collision of the satellitesimals with one another in their orbits- which would take place only in so far as these crossed, or were made to cross, one another-and, in part, on collisions with infalling planetesimals-which either drove them into the nucleus or into new orbits from which sooner or later a plunge into the nucleus would be likely to ensue. A planetesimal plunging into a satellitesimal would drive it into the nucleus in only a certain proportion of cases, but, under the laws of mechanics, both planetesimal and satellitesimal must return to the point of collision-unless diverted by some intercurrent agency or prevented by too high velocity-and be subject to another collision which would give another chance of being deflected into the nucleus, and so on indefinitely. It appears then that the orbital or satellitesimal deployment of the particles of the knots served not only as a slow source of feeding for the nucleus or core, but also as a collecting mechanism for catching planetesimals; so also, in reciproc- ity, the planetesimals aided in driving in the satellitesimals. In some measure, indeed, the whole of the sphere of gravitative control surrounding each knot served as a collecting agency by reason of its power of deflecting passing parti- cles toward the center and thus increasing their liability to be caught. But the process of aggregation was none the less slow. S"Jones' Criticism of Chamberlin's Groundwork for the Study of Megadiastro- phism," Am. Jour. Sci.

The mechanics of the case make it clear that the earth's relatively large satellite must have modified the orbits of planetesimals in respect to the earth's center, in the same way as Jupiter modifies the orbits of comets that come near it, relative to the sun. The moon thus served as an auxiliary collecting agency. These several features of the collecting process satisfy quite fully the essential conditions named as competent by Reid. The collecting pro- cess as here described is the normal one; it is not at all special, nor shaped to escape any difficulty, since no difficulty is recognized. It is a feature of the inevitable chain of sequences that spring from the primary postu- lates of the hypothesis. Independent of these considerations, special discussions of the rota- tional effects of the infall of planetesimals, with illustrations, are given by Chamberlin' and by Moulton2 in their respective textbooks, setting forth what they regard as satisfactory evidence that the direct infall of planetesimals would tend to give forward rotations. The cogency of these treatments is not directly challenged by Reid. The evidence cited in these discussions implies considerable effectiveness, and it has been thought that the rotations would be more likely to be in excess of those observed than short of them. This prompted a closer study which brought out automatic checking processes and a tendency to equilibrium, already referred to, and here cited: From these considerations there springs the very important conclusion that there is an equilibrium value for rotation in cases of this kind. If, for any reason, the planet, while undergoing accretion, acquires a rotational speed above this value, the counteracting effect of the accessions will tend to depress the rate of rotation until the equilibrium rate is reached. If the rotation falls below the equilibrium rate, the effect of the accessions is to raise it to the equilibrium value. If the distribution, or the forms, or the proportions of the little infalling bodies are changed, the equilibrium rate of rotation is likely to change also, and the net effects of further accessions will tend to change the rotation that prevailed before the change to the new equilibrium rate. There is thus an automatic regulative system by which the rate of rotation is made to oscillate about an equilibrium value.3 From all these considerations there seems to be abundant ground for concluding that the planetesimal hypothesis is not only competent in ' Chamberlin and Salisbury, Geology, 1906, pp. 70-77.

REVIEWS 250</page><page sequence="10">REVIEWS respect to the rotations observed but that it is peculiarly well fitted to explain the varying rotations and their rather low range of values, where other hypotheses are weak. THE DENSITIES OF THE PLANETS Reid opens his discussion thus: The densities of the planets are supposed to be due to three causes, the nature of the planetesimals retained or collected, the amount of contraction under their own gravitation, and their temperatures [p. 62]. While these are among the agencies assigned, those most stressed in the authoritative literature of the hypothesis are readjustment and reor- ganization. In particular, stress is laid (i) on selective rearrangements, by which compactness is secured and the denser matter segregated down- ward, (2) on metamorphisms, by which new minerals better fitted for their environment, and usually denser, are formed (involving endother- mic as well as exothermic changes), (3) and now, under the new atomic doctrine, on atomic reorganization. In the face of the possibilities of the last, it is quite idle to attack the planetesimal hypothesis on the score of density-at least just now. It is in better shape to weather the storm of revolutionary disclosures than any of its competitors, as the revolu- tionary results thus far have amply shown. THE SUPPOSED DIFFICULTY OF HOLDING THE MOON Reid offers computations intended to show that it was unlikely that the moon could remain within the sphere of control of the earth during the postulated states of growth (p. 50). Unfortunately, he neglects to take into account the tidal reactions between the growing moon and the growing earth during these supposedly critical stages. The classic investigations of Darwin have made familiar the high value he put on the earth-moon tides in pushing the satellite away from the earth. Obvi- ously, on the other hand, the growth of the earth and moon would tend to draw them together. The two form a pair of opposing pulls which tended to keep the moon oscillating between the tendency to come too near and the tendency to fly off entirely. Some of the details, for which there is no room here, show that this couplet is very effective. REID ON THE SATELLITES The discussion of satellites is opened thus: According to the planetesimal hypothesis the nuclei of the satellites are supposed originally to have been revolving around their primaries, in any plane and in any direction [p. 49]. 251</page><page sequence="11">REVIEWS Like the statement at the start, this begins in the middle of things. Furthermore, it is unwarrantably general in respect to planes and direc- tions. Note the contrast between its free and sweeping terms and the concreteness of the following by the author of the hypothesis: It is assumed as inevitable that the main ejected masses [solar eruptions] should have been attended by fragments or sub-knots torn from them as they were belched violently forth. . . .. While these fragments or sub-knots were shot out with the principal masses, it was inevitable that there should be diver- gencies that gave them separate courses near the main masses, which resulted in revolutions about these masses when their control was competent. They thus became attendant or satellite knots. Fragments whose courses were too divergent or too swift of course escaped. It is thus assumed that the collecting centers of the satellites-to-be originated as incidents of the vigorous ejection of the primary knots.' From other texts it appears even more specifically that the satellite nuclei were subcenters of control within the spheres of control of the planetary nuclei. While this undoubtedly resulted in some notable variety of plane and of direction of revolution, there is nothing of the unrestricted generality of the statement "revolving about their primaries in any plane and in any direction." It is definitely implied that the satel- lite motions are controlled by phases of the forces that gave rise to the planetary motions. Planetary knots and satellite knots alike are logical derivatives of the more fundamental agencies of solar eruptivity and the differential attraction of the passing star. The builder of this feature of the hypothesis is liable to error in working out these subpostulates, alike with the critic in interpreting them, while the fundamentals may remain, in spite of these errors, altogether unassailable. They are of course sub- ject to criticism as secondaries, and also in so far as they can be shown to be essential to the basal hypothesis, but not as though they were in them- selves fundamental. A little farther on the discussion is interrupted by another surprising footnote, as follows: The protagonists of the planetesimal hypothesis have added an auxiliary hypothesis to account for the existence of retrograde satellites, namely, that they are late acquisitions by capture [p. 58]. No reference is given and it has proved impossible to find any sub- stantial clue to so singular a misapprehension. The protagonists regard their explanation of the retrograde satellites as one of the triumphs of the hypothesis. The existence of such secondaries was anticipated before I The Origin of the Earth, pp. 143-44. 252</page><page sequence="12">REVIEWS they were discovered, and Moulton gave some important specifications respecting their orbits. The following quotations partially cover the ground: All satellites, as a necessity of their continuance as satellites, revolve within the spheres of control of their primaries. In view of this, it is assumed that the satellite knots left the sun within the spheres of control of their primaries and that they always remained within them. A captured satellite, while perhaps not an impossibility, should bear distinct earmarks of its exotic origin.' No earmarks of this sort have been recognized. And farther on- Both Jupiter and Saturn have goodly families of satellites that revolve in harmony with themselves. Yet Jupiter has two moons that revolve in a retro- grade direction, and Saturn has one. Under the planetesimal view this is inter- preted to mean that the larger part of the fragmenting action about the borders of the great belches that sent forth the Jovian and Saturnian knots was actuated by the great impulses that gave rotation to the primary knots, but yet that minor fragmenting outbursts occurred on the opposite side and gave rise to secondary knots with retrograde rotation. . . .. As anticipated by Moulton, from the mechanics of the case, before their discovery, their orbits were notably eccentric and the planes of their orbits divergent from the planes of their pri- maries.' SOLAR ERUPTION AND THE TIDAL THEORY Near the close of his article, where Reid first explains the action of the passing star, he says: The tidal forces set up in the sun by the star are supposed to reduce pressure on the sun on the sides toward and away from the star and the forces, which now shoot forth masses of gas, are supposed to become much more effective and to expel greater quantities of matter to greater distances [p. 63]. While this is true, it is inadequate. It largely misses the specific point urged. Instead of vague "sides'" toward and from the tide-raising body, the hypothesis lays stress on the "tidal cones " as cones, that is, as reliefs of pressure increasing toward the apices of the cones. In addition to this, it lays stress on the belt of inward pressure that wraps about the sun between these cones. The combination constitutes a special mechan- ism singularly well fitted for concentrating eruptive efects at the points of the cones. This is quantitatively illustrated by the accompanying figure used in discussing this point in The Origin of the Earth (p. iio). These specific features are important for in them lies the peculiar fitness of this combination of stresses to meet the extraordinary require- 253 SIbid., pp. 152-53. 2 Ibid., pp. 154-55.</page><page sequence="13">REVIEWS ments of the case. These requirements have already been stated' and emphasized, but there seems need for no end of reiteration to drive them home and make them stay. There must be such concentration of the more general forces as to bring to bear upon 1/700 of the sun's mass energy sufficient to further fractionate it and shoot out these fractions to distances varying from thirty million to three billion miles, and these must, in the process, acquire 98 per cent of the angular moment of momentum of the whole system. On the other hand, the central body retains 699/700 of the mass, but only a meager 2 per cent of the moment of momentum. This is a most extraordinary concentration and at the same time equally extraordinary partition and distribution. This is the very FIG. i.-Diagram of tidal forces showing lifting forces in due proportions and directions to and from the moon and the girdle of compressive forces at right angles to these. Note that the direct compression is half that of direct lifting. Prepared by F. R. Moulton. crux of the generative activities postulated. It is the climacteric feature in the genetic chain. Reid's criticisms on this feature are as follows: We are entirely ignorant of the causes of solar eruptions and cannot say definitely whether the near approach of a star would increase or decrease their violence. The increased activity must be considered merely as an addi- tional hypothesis and not as a necessary result of the tidal forces due to the star. Jeans has developed the effects produced by a passing star in quite a different way, and without assuming any expulsive forces [p. 63]. A strange Janus-faced attitude is disclosed in this quotation. In the first sentence Reid assumes a tone that might be appropriate if rigor- ous demonstration were claimed for all that concerns the eruptivity of the sun. It is not usually presumed that all the postulates of a hypothe- sis will be demonstrated beyond cavil as far back as their causes. The ' The general doctrine of close approach or dynamic encounter as a cosmological agency was set forth, apparently for the first time explicitly, in an article entitled "On a Possible Function of Disruptive Approach in the Formation of Meteorites, Comets, and Nebulae."

Geol., Vol. IX (July-August, 1901), pp. 362-93. 254</page><page sequence="14">REVIEWS question seems to be shifted from one of reasonable hypothesis to one of proof. The author of a hypothesis of this kind does well if all his postulates are reasonable, as we are about to see. In the last sentence the tone is reversed; but as to that, a little later. When anyone declares entire ignorance on the part of those for whom he presumes to speak in the first person, he has the advantage of position and there are embarrassments in disputing him. However, we may still entertain the view that those who have recently made very important contributions to the eruptive phenomena of the sun may have gained some intimations of their cause, though these may yet be far from com- plete and fully demonstrable. There may even be some approaches to certainty that tone down their "entire ignorance." Even the ordinary student of these phenomena may feel some certainty that the sun and the stars are pouring forth prodigious radiant energies, and that the only adequate source of supply for these energies at the surface where radiation takes place is furnished by prodigious convectional movements in the gaseous body of the sun or star, and that these violent out-and-in move- ments are what we call eruptivity. To imagine a sun or star engaged in radiation, vigorous enough to make it a sun or star, without eruptive convection, lacks plausibility enough for a place in a hypothesis that is even tolerably reasonable. The prodigious radiation necessary to make the sun a sun at all may not satisfy Reid's idea of the cause of the solar eruptions but it does seem to mitigate somewhat our "entire ignorance." But it is not necessary always to know the cause of a phenomenon to deal with it successfully. Our race has always been more or less ignorant of the cause of the cellularity of wood, but none the less it used logs as a float successfully at a very early date. It is well known that the sun is eruptive all over its surface. It is also well known that its eruptivity is often highly concentrated in the equatorial belt, where radiation is greatest for several reasons. It is known that solar substance is there projected to great heights. Taken together, these show susceptibility to concentration of the type postulated. It is known from mechanics that stress may be superposed on stress. In this case, it is postulated that differential gravitative stress of the kind actuated by the passing star is superposed on differential gravitative stress of the kind connected with solar convection. The superposed stress takes the shape of a great enswaddling compress belt with polar easements normal to it, these grow- ing more and more effective toward the conal points. On this cogent groundwork, it is inferred that the convectionally eruptive forces will act outwardly from the conal points with special effectiveness. Even if this 255</page><page sequence="15">REVIEWS may not be thought to be beyond cavil, it seems far more probable than any alternative. In singular contrast to the exacting spirit that questions this concen- tration of eruptivity is the uncritical tone of the statement in the last sentence, that "Jeans has developed the effects produced by a passing star in quite a different way, and without assuming any expulsive force." This implies that Jeans's development is such as to meet the requirements of the case in hand; for if not, it has no place in the discussion. If the sun is reduced to a state in which there is no eruptivity of any kind, and the whole action is simply the tide of the passing star, the requirements of the case take this shape: (i) a tidal lift taking the form of a dispersion of planetary matter to distances ranging from thirty million to three billion miles, and (2) a concentration of this intense tidal effect on one- seventh of i per cent of the tidally affected body. The only natural case that seems to satisfy the condition of non-eruptivity is one in which the sun has ceased to be a sun, by passing into a liquid or solid state. Then there would be only volcanic and similar eruptivity, or none at all, and the tidal effect would be distributed as required by tidal mechanics. This view would better be named "the dead sun theory" to avoid misunder- standing. If, to avoid the insuperable difficulties of this case, the sun be supposed to be so large a gaseous body as to reduce sensibly the enor- mous tidal lift, the difficulty is merely stifled. Convectional eruptivity then comes in of neccessity. Besides, the great gaseous sun must be condensed later and this would give a rotational moment of momentum beyond the observed amount, for the expanded sun could not escape notable effects from the forward pull of the passing star, which must either have been great enough to give revolution to the planets, or the sun must have had rotation enough to give them orbital courses, either of which seems irreconcilable with the requirements of the case. We do not think that Jeans has even remotely met the precise demands of the case, nor does he seem to claim that, for he has recently said that "Mathe- matical research of a kind and amount which can only be described as terrifying will be necessary before we can assert with any confidence that our solar system can be fully explained by this theory."' The decision, however, will really rest, as in all similar cases, on the naturalistic evidence of the case. Mathematics will, of course, make its appropriate contribu- tion to the elucidation of this, but mathematics cannot independently solve the problem. ' The Nebular Hypothesis and Modern Cosmogony, May, 1922, p. 28. 256</page><page sequence="16">REVIEWS This "tidal theory" is little other than the planetesimal hypothesis with solar eruptivity left out.' The tidal theory was published thirteen years later than the planetesimal theory and adopted the postulate of close approach or dynamic encounter-with inevitable tidal action- which is the soul of the older hypothesis. It is not clear what is to be gained by leaving out of consideration so effective an agency as solar eruptivity. But the question is not one of advantage but one of reality. If solar eruptivity did not exist, it must of course be left out of considera- tion. If it did exist actually, or potentially in a form liable to be brought into action, it must be considered if the theory is to relate to the real case. Theoretical emasculation is inadmissible. Unless, then, the "dead sun" phase is adopted-and it does not seem to be-the tidal theory, to be a naturalistic theory, must take eruptivity into account and be merely the planetesimal hypothesis under another name, varying merely in the effects assigned to the tidal factor. But if tidal action radically different from that commonly recognized is urged, it might better appear as a dis- tinct and revolutional contribution to the theory of tides, accompanied by specifications of the conditions and limitations under which the extraor- dinary class of actions postulated takes place. If they fit this cosmologic case, they are quite different from any tidal action heretofore assigned. One who views the subject from the realistic point of view finds it difficult to see how the potential eruptivity of the sun can be left out of account, if the sun was really a sun at the time of the separation of the planetary matter. THE THEORY OF SPIRAL NEBULAE On first reading of Reid's strange statement that the disruptive approach of a star (or its dynamic equivalent) was not regarded as a necessary feature of the planetesimal hypothesis, search was made to find, if possible, how he could have received such an impression. At first, it was thought that it might have arisen from the disclaimer made and emphasized at an early date that the postulated mode of origin of spiral nebulae was not an essential:2 Let it be distinctly understood that the planetesimal doctrine of accretion does not stand or fall with this particular conception [that of the origin of spiral nebulae by dynamic encounter, mentioned in the paragraphs next above this sentence]. 'James H. Jeans, "The Motion of Tidally Distorted Masses with Special Refer- ence to Theories of Cosmogony," Mem. Roy. Astro. Soc., 1917, p. i. 2 Chamberlin and Salisbury, Geology, Vol. II (1905), p. 40. 257</page><page sequence="17">REVIEWS It seemed for the moment that this disclaimer might have been under- stood to include the postulate of a passing star which played an essential part in the theory of spiral nebulae as well as the hypothesis of earth genesis. But this explanation lost most of what plausibility it had when it was found, near the end of the paper, that the spiral nebulae were brought into the field of attack (p. 63). Reid cites Campbell as saying that the spiral nebulae "abhor the Milky Way." He does not note, on the other side, that Chamberlin has pointed out (i) that symmetrical spirals would not extend outside the sphere of control of the parent sun because the dynamic conditions outside are hostile, (2) that in the crowded stellar regions the spheres of control of the stars are small because of the competition of the surrounding attractions, (3) that nebulae small enough to be fitted to make planetary systems like ours could not be seen at stellar distances, (4) that the arms would wrap up quickly beyond recog- nition as a spiral, when the center was relatively massive as in cases of this kind, and that, therefore, so far as the crowded stellar regions are concerned, the apparent absence of spirals tallies with the limitations of conditions and of vision. These considerations seem more plausible than the postulate of galactic abhorrence. If, however, anthropomorphic phraseology is permissible, it ought perhaps to be added that the giant spiral nebulae seem to be deeply in love with the regions of the galactic poles. Outside the galaxy, there is doubtless plenty of room for spirals of great size to deploy, but why the outer spirals should entertain this tender affection for the polar regions is a secret for some other time and place than this. Still, it is pertinent to the principles herein involved to note that suitable aggregations of gravitative pulls may have the same disrupting effect whether they are embodied in a passing star or are aggregated in some other way. It is theoretically certain that aggrega- tions of concurrent gravitative lines occur at the surfaces of constellations, as well as of stars, while the gravitative lines in the interiors of constella- tions and stars alike more or less neutralize one another with approach toward zero at the center or centroid. On the surfaces the concurrent effects are differentiated if the constellation is spheroidal or lenticular or ring-like, and are greater on the flattened sides or the polar region. Theo- retically, therefore, there is a meniscus of relatively high concurrent gravity on the sides of the galaxy centering toward the poles in so far as the galaxy is symmetrical. If then stars are shot out of the galaxy, as molecules of a gas are shot out, with exceptional velocities, this concentra- tion of concurrent attraction may have something to do with the singular distribution and velocities of these outer spirals. But until there is better 258</page><page sequence="18">REVIEWS agreement as to the what, the where, the whence, and the whither of these outer spirals, the groundwork for guessing at the how and the why is quite precarious. Reid refers in very considerate terms to the recent studies of Van Maanen, which seem to show that the knots of certain large nebulae move in the general direction of the arms rather than at appreciable angles to them as in the familiar artificial and theoretical spirals. The motions of the arms and their progressive deformations are not specifically reported. Their determination is difficult because of their vagueness, but they are essential factors of the case. This does not imply, however, that this will not prove to be a new and unfamiliar class. While waiting for more complete results we may do well to beware of "single track thinking" by supposing that the modus of this class disproves the assigned mode of formation of other classes. More than one mode of genesis of spirals are already recognized. The intimation of still another does not, in itself, throw any legitimate doubt on Moulton's deductions relative to a case where radically different proportions of the actuating agencies are supposed to have prevailed. GENERAL COMMENTS Several other points in the paper invite comment but our space is already overstrained. If we take a general perspective, there are aspects of the paper which call for commendation. It is an open, declared, delib- erate, and courageous challenge. Much as one may feel compelled to note that Reid has fallen short of an adequate appreciation of the hypoth- esis criticized, he must place this explicit discussion in a higher rank than fugitive criticism without substantial support. A proper rating of this critique is best reached through comparisons in kind, for these are needed to reveal the difficulties of the terrane over which the attack has to be made, if made at all. The line of criticism that has perhaps seemed to the casual reader the most formidable has been based on the infrequency of the approach of stars within disturbing distances. Starting from mathematical computa- tions, it carries the great weight usually attached to such computations, particularly if we do not understand them. From the velocities, dis- tances, and directions of motion of such stars as are available, the time between disruptive approaches has been computed and found to be very long, very impressively long. Specifically, the result varies with the assumptions made, but in all cases is very long. While in reality these computations are not complete or conclusive in specific results, there is no doubt that the interval is very long. This is a good start toward an 259</page><page sequence="19">REVIEWS argument, but when the prodigious length of the interval is reached, the argument seems to give place to emotion and the logic goes little or no farther. A fine minor premise is laid, but where is the rest of the argu- ment ? Probably it is felt that anyone ought to see that, without state- ment. But what is the unexpressed major premise, and what is the specific Q.E.D. ? Apparently it is hidden in the inherited belief that all stars have attendant planetary systems and that all planets are like our planets. Even if this were true, the added postulate that planets do not have lives as long as the computed intervals is needed to make the argu- ment good. Let us look a little closer at these "silent partners" in the argument. The intervals between disturbing approaches are computed for a single star. The frequency for the sum total of stars is found by dividing this interval by the number of stars (plus equivalents). This puts a different face on the figures and the emotions they incite and suggests the need of further inspection. It is important to note that the computations just as conclusively show that one star will make the disturbing approach in the computed time-taken as an average case-as that it will not make it in less time. How many planetary systems like ours does the planetesimal hypothesis postulate? Strictly, just one, our own; inferentially, as many, and only as many, as the prerequisite approaches have been competent to bring into being. It was emphasized at the very outset, as the very basis of the hypothesis, that our planetary system is not only not of the self- generated (monoecious) class, but is distinctive and peculiar in being bi-parental. Very likely all stars generate the self-generative class of secondaries; no doubt that, as in the fables of old, the parent star swal- lows her own children and then proceeds to generate others. But we have nothing to do with this class here. The computations, if they are good at all, show that some close approaches must take place; the genesis of our planetary system calls for only one of these certainties; it inferentially postulates as many more as the computations indicate. The computations thus serve as a con- firmation. The postulate of a suitable approach seems well nigh "demon- strated mathematically." What then does the infrequency signify? The more infrequent such a genesis, the more distinguished the birth of our planet, the more aristo- cratic our planetary family. It is the future, however, that most concerns us. The greater the infrequency of disturbing approaches, the longer the prospective life of our 260</page><page sequence="20">REVIEWS system. If we can rely on the computed infrequency, we can tell when the next planetary disturbance will overtake us, assuming that ours is an average case and that we know approximately the length of the geologic past. We have simply to subtract from the total interdisturb- ance period the time our planet has already lived; the remainder is the future allotted us. The only contingency about this lies in the possi- bility that our planetary system may die out of itself in some way. We may have to risk that, but we are assured against a smash-up. But, barring a domestic failure, and taking five or ten billions of years as an over-generous allowance for the geological past, we have only to subtract this from the long, long interval between disastrous approaches, and the rest will be the computed "expectancy of life" of our planetary family. If it has been noticed that we have refrained from putting into figures the great length of the computed interval between dangerously disturbing approaches, one reason may now be seen in our lack of courage to put seriously before the public so stupendous an expectancy of life, even though almost "mathematically demonstrated." The very "formidable difficulty" of high infrequency of approach turns out almost too strong an ally. "Our friends the enemy" do not always support us so over- generously. The attacks from other quarters have been less ponderous, and, as might be expected, less gratifying in the end. Most of them have been fugitive, trivial, and negligible; but some have come from quarters where intelligence might be expected. Disrespect for the bi-parental origin of the planetary system has been implied by dubbing it a "freak of nature," but this is to be taken lightly because the perpetrator was obviously so straining after wit that he forgot his own pedigree. He may be left to the tender mercies of the bi-parental world in general, with the suggestion that this includes the inorganic as well as the organic. Most of the adverse comments seem to imply rather an indifferent or reluctant atti- tude than a hostile one. They have come mainly from those who have not yet learned what the solar system really is, as a dynamic mechanism. Some have not come to distinguish between planet-killers (meteorites) and planet-feeders (planetesimals). In this in particular confusion of thought is revealed by confounding things that are dynamically very diverse. The general effect is to befog the whole subject of cosmogony. It has been observed that these obscurations come most frequently from a land famous for its fogs, and there may be a climatic factor in it. Now, comparing all these with the dignified and explicit paper under review, it is quite obvious that the latter stands on a higher plane. At 261</page><page sequence="21">REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
