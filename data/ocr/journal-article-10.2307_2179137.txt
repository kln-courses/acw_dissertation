<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN ESTHETICS. IT may seem like heresy to assert a foundation for esthetics in nature, yet careful consideration of the evidence makes it clear that there is something in the things called beautiful which is needed to explain the pleasurable sensations we have in con- templating them. Categories of objective difference and likeness must be assumed at the outset, and of these difference is the pre- requisite of consciousness. An impression which persists gradu- ally loses its power to impress; an object continually seen gradu- ally becomes invisible; a sound continually heard at last ceases to be noticed. If all objects were likes to each other we should have no means of cognizing them, while if they differed totally from each other they could not be segregated into classes and knowledge of, them would be impossible. For this there are re- quired at once the superficial difference which complies with the law of consciousness by producing the shock we call feeling, and the ftindamental likeness which is needed for cognition. Know- ing even to this extent is pleasurable, and the discovery of like- ness at the very heart of difference is the real source of the esthetic satisfactions. All the while the subjective procedure is a direct outcome of the objective process. With qualifications and amplifications understood, motion is produced away from directions of greatest stress towards directions of least stress. Change thus oriented is the easiest in both inanimate and ani.- mate; taking place as activities of the organism it gets the ideal- ization of feeling and is not only the easiest but also the most agreeable. There is a degree of pleasure when an object is re- cognized; there is more of it. when separate objects are perceived as likes; the pleasure is greatest when the mingling of difference with likeness; the triumph of likeness over difference, take come plex forms. An example may be selected from decorative art, whose like patterns are regularly varied by difference. If iteration were all -if it were merely a question of saving effort by mere repetition 271</page><page sequence="2">272 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXX. -then a series of dots or parallel lines would be the most beau- tiful object man could contemplate. The effect of beauty is gained in much more intense form when the likeness is compli- cated with difference. There must be iteration to constitute a beautiful pattern, but there must also be variety to save it from becoming monotonous. It is the orderly union of likeness and unlikeness which makes the square more beautiful than the straight line, the circle or sphere more beautiful than the square. A twirl of the hand and the circle is drawn, however imperfectly; a square requires four movements, each separately and differ- ently directed. In the line there is no variation-simply an ad- vance in space; the circle continually changes direction and yet through all changes preserves its roundness, each part of it at once like and unlike every other. It is in circles, spirals and curved lines generally that we obtain the utmost maximum of the likeness which makes for ease of cognition, with the utmost mini- mum of the difference which is needed for the appeal to con- sciousness. And it is largely for this reason that curved forms such as are met with in the sweeping lines of great bridges, or in the archways of cathedrals, excite the esthetic sense and give pleasure to the beholder. The symmetries of design afford other illustrations of the in- terplay between the requirement of likeness and the demand for difference. The eye rests with greater pleasure on a scheme which is symmetrical than upon one in-which the figures are irregularly spaced and of unlike shape. Cognition of such a scheme is easier. Its elements recruit each other, differing as they do so; the mind returns, if in slightly varied ways, to the elements it has already perceived; it is saved the effort to readjust itself to something totally new, and is at the same time challenged by something dif- ferent woven into the texture of the old. The symmetrical pat- tern in which like elements recur is thus more 'intelligible, pleases more, strains the cognitive faculty less than would a pattern founded wholly on difference. All this is shown, not only in the sinipler forms of decorative art, where the elements are little more than repetitions, but also in the elaborate patterns which, made up of elements that at once vary from and resemble each other, constitute so much of the beauty of architecture.</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.] THE OBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN ESTHETICS. 273 Structures which nature fashions or come forth at the call of man also show the arrangements that underlie esthetics. Organs most fitted to their work, such as secure the highest degree of efficiency and economy for maintenance, show curved, iterated, symmetrical or otherwise self-assimilated forms, and therefore excite more or less pleasure in the beholder. The beauty of the crystal, the tree, the honeycomb, the spider's web, the bird's wing, does but reappear in the bow, the scythe, the gearing of machin- ery, the screw of the propeller, the blades of the ventilating fan, as the concomitant of economical, efficient, maintenance-securing appliances. George Iles writes: "In stairways the boards on which we tread now meet in smooth curves; so do the walls of rooms as they reach ceilings and floors, conducing to ease and thoroughness in sweeping and cleansing. In outer walls, in- door- ways, similar curves reduce liability to hurt and harm. . . . Fac- tory chimneys have long been built round instead of square: to-day in the best designs the ducts to a chimney are also freely curved. In blast furnaces this is the rule for every part of the structure, ensuring gain in strength, lessening resistance to the flow of gases, and thus saving much fuel. When water pipes varying in diameter are joined, the junction should be a gradual curve, otherwise retarding eddies will arise, wasting a good deal of energy. . . . All the various parts of heavy guns are curved, since any sharpness of angle at a joint brings in a hazard of rup- ture under the tremendous strains of explosion. . . . A glance at a war ship discovers her varied use of curves in defence; to deflect shot and shell her plates are given bulging lines, her tur- rets are built in spherical contours, and her casemates are convex throughout.... There is a gain in building breakwaters with an easy curve. To give their masonry and timbers a perpen- dicular face would be to invite damage, whereas a flowing con- tour, like that of a shelving beach, slows down an advancing breaker and checks its shock. In rearing lighthouses to bear the brunt of ocean storms the outline of a breaker is repeated to the utmost degree feasible."' Self-assimilated and inter-assimilated activities, both as carried on and as contemplated, arouse the esthetic sense.

XXX. ments produced rhythmically, and therefore with the minimum of difficulty, the maximum of ease, have the quality of beauty; where movements show unlike duration and interval a maximum instead of a minimum of effort is required, and we call them stiff, awkward, ungainly, ungraceful. Not only do assimilated move- ments avoid the waste of effort involved by unassimilated activi- ties-a waste due to separate mental determinations, as well as to separate neuro-muscular adjustments: they economize the effort put forth in contemplation, since like elements that recur spare the need of changing adaptations to its object by the mind. Note the exercise of dancing, where many of the movements take place along curved lines, and in which the figures, could they be fixed, would often suggest the symmetries of design. "The beauty of curved motion," says Wolfflein, " is perhaps never more effectively shown than in the majestic flight of birds of prey." Darwin, in The Voyage of a Naturalist, tells us that " when con- dors are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot their flight is beautiful." Most of us have taken a degree of pleasure in the spinning motions of the top, with its graceful secondary curves; in the gyroscope, which rotates as well as spins; even in the revolutions of the otherwise prosaic flywheel. There is a noticeable qualification without any essential dif- ference in the pleasure excited by natural scenery. We cannot say that the features of a landscape are spread out before us with the simple regularity of an artificially devised pattern. They are in groups: the objects they include may suggest multifarious ideas. Yet much of the difference observed proceeds from com- plexity. There are meanwhile countless iterated elements within the irregularity. A rude unity of impression arises even from the ensemble. The fact that the admiration of natural scenery is a late acquirement in the history of the race must not delude us into the supposition that because early literatures, are lacking in descriptions of nature out modern sentiment towards it has no relation to the likening process. In primitive stages of human development the mind finds satisfaction for its esthetic sense only in the most simple resemblances, as these occur in the parallels, zigzags or iterated dots which we find in the art of savages-in the repeated beat of the barbaric tom-tom, or in the recurrent</page><page sequence="5">No. 3.] THE OBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN ESTHETICS. 275 notes, without melody, of early music. As to primitive peoples our modern musical compositions would present only a confused jumble of irregularities, worthy of ridicule rather than admira- tion, so to ancient man the landscape, contemplated in the large, must have suggested chaos rather than order, and could not have been esthetically intelligible. It is possibly because of advance in the power to recognize similarities beneath variety, funda- mental likenesses in and through superficial differences, that the modern mind is able to take pleasure in those complexes of the regular and uniform within the irregular which make up what we call the beautiful in nature. Otherwise it would be difficult to account for that subtle fascination which, drawing men to forest and sea, to mountain and river, makes real the poet's fancy of, A distant dearness in the hill, A secret sweetness in the stream. For within and beneath all the objective multiplicity and com- plexity of the landscape there are rich iterations, harmonious repetitions, large symmetries that, appealing to all the senses at once, endlessly emphasize and recruit each other-the rustling of millions of leaves supplemented by their like forms endlessly pro- longed; the rhythmic murmur of stream or sea, mingling with the repetitions of sound; the iterations of contour which simultane- ously reach the eye; the regular undulations of a ' rolling ' land- scape, or the divisions man has contrived in it; the wide areas of growing grain whose slender stalks flow in wind-chased waves, or the long meadows dotted with daisies; the crenelated zig-zags of distant mountains, cutting their iterated patterns into the fringe of overhanging clouds; then, between earth and sky, thus filled with impressions for the eye, the rhythmic hum of insects, the slower pulses in the notes of birds. The beauty of the organized rhythm which we call music- simple as a product of the human voice, more complex when the sounds are given forth by instruments-is also largely a result of the complication of the law of assimilation with the law of consciousness. Melody is undoubtedly indispensable to music, yet music begins in the simplest regular-interval sounds; melody -variation in pitch and time-is added to relieve the monotony</page><page sequence="6">276 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXX. of the one-note, equal-spaced sounds, account being taken of the fact that the same impression continually iterated finally ceases to be noticed; it is therefore a contrivance for refreshing the con- sciousness with the shock of sensations continually varied. Mel- ody, being superadded, is thus the superficial aspect of music, while rhythm is its permanent element, its fundamental factor, founded on that law of the inorganic which makes repetition, iteration, likeness, the direction of least resistance. Whence it follows that melody could be eliminated from music without dis- turbing its fundamental character. None the less are the most pleasurable effects of musical sounds due to that mingling of the superficially unlike with the fundamentally like which enables the mind to recognize uniformity beneath variety and symmetry within difference. It may be said that there is something absolute in music, some- thing unrelated to the conditions of time and space. How much? The quality of the musical sensation, like that of the visual sen- sation, has an apparently unrelated element, and is to that extent unergriindlich. We cannot say why ether vibrations should yield the sensation of red or blue; all we know is that, given the inter- play between the ether and the organism, such and such sensa- tions do actually result. The matter of importance is not the special character of these subjective products, which must vary for different types of organisms, but rather their character as likenesses and differences. None of the notes, melodies, compposi- tions we hear have any label of language which joins them indis- solubly to particular concepts, ideas or trains of thought; yet this very nature of theirs, as unchained from the trammels of speech, sets feeling and thought free to weave what they will from per- sonal mood and individual experience. As the very vagueness of the suggestion lends itself to the recovery of subtle resem- blances unattainable through the medium of bound words, so the indefinite amplitude and massive sweep of the conscious states aroused by music more than make up' for any lack of 'intensity in the momentary impression. And though the same sounds, the same melody, may have unlike suggestions for different individ- uals, there is for each of them a collocation of sound and feeling that endures. Deeper, moreover, than any personal linking of</page><page sequence="7">No. 3.] THE OBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN ESTHETICS. 277 musical sounds with individual experience is that subtle recovery of race associations which is common to all. Long centuries of contact with nature have impressed upon us classes of sensations which resound more or less clearly, more or less remotely, at the touch of music. The rustle of the forest, the pattering of rain, the glint of sunshine on lake or sea, torrent-traversed valleys or mountains wreathed in mist, the cloud sailing through deep blue across the moon, morning star and western night glow, calm of summer landscape and riot of winter storm-all find their dis- tant reverberation in the feelings aroused by musical sounds. Given the rapidly changing shocks required for vivid conscious- ness-given, therefore, the superficial differences from which they come-then even our unbound and speechless music must be viewed as a vast system of meaning-laden repetitions which, vaguely organized into recoverable classes, their differences domi- nated by likenesses, captivate the fancy and overwhelm the im- agination as they unify man with nature and make life and feel- ing one. The manner in which the rhythm of musical sound and of human speech echo the rhythms of nature and of art is especially instructive. We hear continually in metaphor of "waves of sound," "rippling tones," " pattering melodies." Weismann' writes of "the mighty ocean of music," of "the swell of the waves of music which surged along," and of the parts of a poly- phonic composition as constituting "the most charming musical architecture." Similar analogies have been recognized between oratory and nature phenomena in descriptions of the former, yielding such phrases as "A combination of cloud, whirlwind and flame; " " The orator rushes upon you in full flood; " " Deep and melodious cadences, as waves upon the shore of a far-re- sounding sea;" "Every sentence came rolling like a wave of the Atlantic three thousand miles long;" "He loved such far-sound- ing words as would suggest the long roll of the wave thundering on the shore;" "He was like a billow of the ocean on the first bright day after the storm, dashing against the rocky cliff and then, sparkling with light, retreating to its home."' " It is to the I The Musical Sense.</page><page sequence="8">278 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXX. sea rather than to fire,' says Frank Byron Jevons,' "that Sappho should be likened, for although her verses are indeed, as the an- cient critics remarked, mixed with fire, and her passion blazes out, now here, now there, and glows always, her verses and her pas- sion are oceanic in their depth and tidal in their strength." " To express the quality of Sappho's verse we must borrow a com- parison from Sappho herself: it is 'more delicate than, waters which make a pleasant noise'?_ "A noise like of a hidden brook In the leafy month of June, That to the sleepy woods all night Singeth a quiet tune." That the iterations which thus affect us do not belong to the realm of human artifice, but originate in the deepest activities of nature, may be seen in that poetic thought of the world which expresses the esthetic feeling in its highest flight. The brook is likened to "chatter and babble"; the rivulet " ripples on in light and. shade" to the maiden's ballad; for Geibel the forest is "green-tongued " ("der Wald mit seinen griinen Zungen '). In Schafer's verse the rustle of the leaves and the chatter of the stream are made one; in Tennyson's lines the "myriad shriek of ocean-wheeling fowl " finds its analogue in the " moving whisper of huge trees," and the "league-long roller thundering on the reef."- The clouds, in their cumulus, alto-cumulus and cirro- cumulus varieties, are "billowy-bosomed" (Browning), or re- semble sheep reposing in a meadow; the waves, likened by the ancient Egyptians to dragons, have been compared by Mdrike to "horses of the gods" ("R&amp;sse der Gdtter"), while Kipling in- tensifies their multitudinous aspect with a metaphor from the chase: The sight of salt water unbounded- The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded. So for innumerable poets the constellations look down on man through the same 'thousand eyes' with which Plato would fain have gazed upon his beloved; so all celestial objects have been A A History of Greek Literature, p. i39.</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.] THE OBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN ESTHETICS. 279 conceived of as vocal, from the sun, which in the verse of Goethe, t6nt nach alter Weise In BrildersphAren Wettgesang, to the stars themselves, in whose song Shakespeare finds heavenly and human harmonies inextricably confounded: Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold. There's not the smallest.orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings, Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims: Such harmony is in immortal souls; But while this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it. The cosmic process, then, so far as we.can be acquainted with it, culminates for feeling in the esthetic satisfactions, and these are adumbrated in the very nature of change as a movement from the direction of greatest stress towards the direction of least stress. It is of the nature of the universe as a dynamic system to maintain its equivalence of power, nor does that pri- mordial necessity cease with the production of difference: pro- longed into the realm of matter, it takes effect in all collocations and rearrangements thereof. Hence on the elementary, pre-vital plane, the 'conservation of energy'; hence also on the higher plane the conservation which we call life. The simpler form of maintenance shows itself in the endurance which is inorganic; later come organisms which, owing to the necessity of death, re- produce their. likes and interact assimilatively in and for asso- ciation. So allso.in the case of conscious states: knowledge is primarily the gathering of sense perceptions into classes of likes by a process which is strictly analogous with that by which like objects are themselves brought together into classes or inter- assimilated for association. Feeling, as we have seen, depends on difference, and esthetic pleasure arises out of likeness complicated with but dominating difference. There is a beginning of this pleasure in cognition itself-in perceiving that objects separated in space, despite superficial differences, are fundamentally like each other; it is more or less distinctly felt in the case of things re-seen or old experiences renewed; it takes more intense form</page><page sequence="10">280 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXX. in the creative production of likes, as in the artistic imitations of sculpture, painting, the drama and literature: as the statue is a mimicry of the human form, so are the play and the novel mimicries of human life, much of the pleasure we experience in viewing the one, in reading the other, coming from the recogni- tion of likeness. Man loves to fashion the environment after himself: his deities are mainly beings in his own image, and though the anthropomorphism is gradually refined, first empha- sizing characters of shape, later characters of will, consciousness and intelligence, the process remains on its formal side a mimicry of the human self. Nor is this play of the likening process in religion invalidated by the fact that, anthropomorphism apart, we are rationally entitled to find in the universe the fundamental characters of our own being, and of these supremely the teleo- logical character, since without it as sourced in the cosmos an organism could not arise. Uniformities of time and space, equally spaced iterations and repetitions, self-assimilated curves and movements, symmetries of natural growth that reappear in artificial patterns, all arise out of the working of the universe towards conditions of least stress, out of its moulding of material units into collocations that secure conditions of utmost harmony and maximum endurance, and may therefore be regarded as ways or modes by which the cosmic function of self-maintenance takes effect in the realm of matter. So the movement in life and mind towards likeness, effective as segregation, operative as assimilation, or resulting from volun- tary imitation, with or without esthetic pleasure, is one with the nature movement' away from directions of greatest towards di- rections of least stress. The esthetic satisfactions are an outcome of the self-maintaining satisfactions, and are related directly through consciousness to the functional activities of both organ- ism and universe. Our enjoyment of music, in which these satis- factions culminate, may be regarded as an enjoyment of that which most completely imitates the universe process itself-of differences buttressed in likeness, of wholes dominating parts, of unity making itself felt through variety, of order emerging from chaos, of the mechanical pervaded by the purposive. If the cos- mos were an organism it would take pleasure in the conversion</page><page sequence="11">No. 3.] THE OBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN ESTHETICS. 28i of differences into likenesses, of change into endurance, of chaotic into harmonious forms; if it were conscious, it would find in the setting up of a star cluster, in the building of a solar system, in the synthesis of a crystal and in the construction of the beautiful organic adaptations seen everywhere in nature, an enjoyment analogous to that which man has in beholding them.
