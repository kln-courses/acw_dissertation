<plain_text><page sequence="1">Engineering Machu Picchu Henry Petroski I he inca people may not have JL had a written language, but the marvels of construction that they left behind continue to speak volumes about their engineering genius. Ma chu Picchu is perhaps the most widely known and admired of the Inca ar chaeological sites, but it is only one of many that are scattered about the Andes mountain range that forms the spine of western South America. Getting to Machu Picchu is no mean feat. From North America, one typical ly flies into Lima, Peru, which is on the coast, and from there inland to Cusco, the ancient Inca capital city. Cusco sits in a high desert valley: The city creeps up onto the surrounding slopes, and its narrow streets and roads and their traffic climb them as if by capillary ac tion. Because Cusco is about 11,000 feet above sea level, many visitors experi ence soroche, or altitude sickness, upon or shortly after arrival. Even those who feel fine are advised to take it easy for a day or so and to curb their enthusi asm for exploring the fascinating town and its environs. Inca stonework, which itself is thought to have evolved from and been built upon pre-Inca work, is vis ible everywhere in the old city. There are open archaeological sites, some thoughtfully protected by substantial and attractive?yet unobtrusive?glass walls. The lower stone walls of many of the public and commercial build ings display the precise but artful and sometimes even whimsical masonry work that is characteristic of the In cas. Hotels, shops and restaurants of all kinds effectively combine old-stone and modern construction. Narrow pe destrian alleyways pass between an cient walls and are paved with practi Henry Petroski is Aleksandar S. Vesic Professor of Civil Engineering and a professor of history at Duke University. Address: Box 90287, Durham, NC 27708-0287 The engineering profession recognizes the prowess of the 15th-century Inca cal stonework that typically includes an open channel for water drainage?a hallmark of Inca infrastructure. When the Spanish invaded and con quered the Inca empire in the early 16th century, they melted down much of the gold that they found in Cusco and elsewhere and shipped it back to Spain. But they brought with them and left behind the look of their home country. Today, much of the most conspicuous architecture of Cusco is a curious combination of Spanish co lonial arches perched atop solid and often severely angular Inca founda tion walls. Fortunately, the Spanish did not discover the remote Machu Picchu, and so it maintains a truly indigenous architecture that gives unadulterated insight into its original design and con struction?and into Inca engineering. Pre-Columbian Architecture Machu Picchu is believed to have been constructed from about 1450 and to have flourished until about 1540, shortly after the collapse of the em pire. Speculation abounds about the exact nature and purpose of the site, but scientists agree that it was used as a sacred location and royal retreat. It is not surprising that the Spaniards never found Machu Picchu. Even to day, it requires an arduous journey to reach the more or less self-contained development. Most tourists take the narrow-gauge railroad?a notable engineering achievement in its own right?that leaves Cusco early in the morning for the almost four-hour ride to cover the roughly 70 miles to Aguas Calientes, which is the town at the base of Machu Picchu, the mountain peak from which the famous site took its name. Alternatively, one can take a bus or van from Cusco through the mountains to catch the train at Ollan taytambo, which is roughly halfway on the rail journey. Since there are no improved roads beyond that point, the train is the only convenient way to gain access to Aguas Calientes. From this opportunistic town of tourist stalls, shops, restaurants and hotels, a steady supply of shuttle buses carry visitors on the 15-minute jour ney up the switchback dirt road lead ing to Machu Picchu, whose elevation is about 3,000 feet lower than that of Cusco, making its weather somewhat warmer and milder and thus suitable for the retreat that it is believed to have been. The views from the bus going up the mountain are spectacular in themselves, but they are only a pale preview of what awaits visitors at the top. Not a few tourists choose to walk up to the site, recapturing the ardu ous experience and stopping at will to marvel at the deeply crevassed and highly ridged mountain scenery. In Machu Picchu's heyday, the jour ney along the Inca Trail from Cusco likely took about a week to complete. The site of the mountainside settlement appears to have been chosen for its strategic as well as its aesthetic value. Located on the east slope of the Andes about 13 degrees south of the Equator, Machu Picchu sits on a narrow ridge between the mountains Machu Pic chu and Huayna Picchu (meaning, respectively, "old peak" and "young peak"). The slopes meeting at the ridge rise steeply to about 1,500 feet above the Urubamba River, a tributary of the Amazon that runs around three sides of the ridge's base. Because Machu Pic chu borders the western edge of the www.americanscientist.org 2009 January-February 15</page><page sequence="2">Bob Krist/Corbis Machu Picchu was built by the Inca beginning in about 1450, most likely as a scared site and a retreat for royalty. The brilliantly designed and executed stonework has survived the ensuing five and a half centuries with amazing perseverance. Amazon basin rain forest, the lushness of the site is in striking contrast to the dry, almost desert-like conditions in the old capital city. Abiding Strength Except for the few reconstructed tim ber frames that rest on and are tied down to stone gables and that support thatched roofs, virtually everything at Machu Picchu is made of stone and soil. The deeply fractured rock in the area provided convenient quarries at and near the site, and made it rela tively easy for the rock to be split and worked into building stones?even though the Inca had just bronze and not iron tools and had to work rock largely with rounded hammer stones. As in Cusco, there are numerous ex amples of worked stone resting on or abutting natural rock outcroppings, showing not only a desire to make use of existing natural structures but also to integrate the artificial into the natu ral?and vice versa. About 50 to 60 percent of Machu Picchu's construction is underground. This hidden work was essential for providing a foundation for walls that retain terraces that collectively stabi lize the steep slopes of the site and pro vide strong and stable foundations for walls and buildings. Had the site not been prepared with care, it is very pos sible that landslides and other slope disturbances in this earthquake-prone region would long ago have caused Machu Picchu to have slipped down the slopes on which it is built. Even modern retaining walls are no torious for failing, but the agricultural terraces behind the ones at Machu Pic chu are so well made and drained that most have endured the test of time. Typically, the deep layer of topsoil on the terraces sits on an equally deep layer of fine sand and gravel, which in turn sits on a base of medium sized gravel, thus providing a natural route for water to drain down from the surface. Stone chips, believed to have been the byproduct of forming the stones for the walls, often underlie all this, providing a further conduit for water. The walls are inclined, or battered, by about 5 degrees back to ward the terrace they retain, and they are backed by smaller stones, which also help drain water down to the next lower terrace. Where building walls were constructed on more or less flat and impervious ground, drain holes were left in the downslope walls so that water would not accumulate be hind them. The fractured rock around the site provided not only easily worked building materials but also a means for rain water to find its way down into the groundwater, which to this day provides the source for the moun tain's springs. The main spring, locat ed about a half mile above the royal residence, has an output sufficient to provide a reliable source of water, another indication of the thoughtful engineering that must have gone into choosing the site. From the spring, the Inca constructed canals to direct the water to where it was needed, and the royal residence had first dibs on fresh, clean water. Such arrangements that have en dured for centuries were not fortu itous, for the size and nature of foun dations and retaining walls, the size 16 American Scientist, Volume 97</page><page sequence="3">and slope of canals and channels that conduct and distribute water, and the intricate arrangement of buildings on a site with steep and possibly unstable slopes took considerable planning. In other words, the Inca were presented with a challenging and interrelated set of problems in planning and engi neering that had to be solved in order to ensure that everything worked as conceived?especially the measures taken to check soil erosion and prevent landslides on the site. And it all does work, even after about three-and-a half centuries of being neglected and another century since it was uncovered from dense jungle overgrowth. Machu Picchu is remarkably well preserved and, where necessary, sensitively re constructed. As water from the spring passes by the royal residence and down to lower areas on the site, that flowing from the main spring falls from one level to an other through graceful notches in the walls, carved in such a way that they direct the stream away from the wall and thereby avoid excess splashing and erosion of the supporting stones. This also made it convenient for the Inca people to collect the water in pot tery bottles known aryballos, which had handles through which a rope could be threaded and a knob over which it could be hooked for carrying on the back. The volume of water that flowed through a vibrant Machu Picchu was just right to support its needs?and the rainfall in the area was just right to recharge the source?another sign of thoughtful and careful site selection and engineering. As essential as firm foundations and adequate water distribution and con trol systems are to the infrastructure and smooth working of any settlement, ancient or modern, it is the above ground walls, terraces and buildings that define the most immediately vis ible and recognizable characteristics of any planned community. This is per haps all the more true at Machu Picchu because of the topographical nature of the site. The geometric patterns estab lished by the multitude of agricultural terraces are striking?actually art-like in their proportions and texture?and tend to dominate one's first glimpse of the overall estate. On closer view, it is the visible stone work of the terrace retaining walls and building facades that captures the imagination and brings the site to life. www.americanscientist.org It was behind, beside and upon these walls that people lived and worked, among granite that is at the same time cold and warm. Doorways and windows have the characteristic Inca trapezoidal shape and proportions, with stone lintels set high enough that tall tourists have little trouble pass ing through them. Two-stone-thick doorways of special importance have "double jambs"?the outside and in side courses of stone being offset from one another?showing them to have been transitions of uncommon con struction and significance. Inside the now largely unroofed buildings visi tors can look down at stone-curbed areas that must once have been filled with soft straw or thatch and thereby served as beds for the more privileged residents of the high mountain ridge. Some walls appear to be as flat and finished as the finest stonework one can find anywhere in the world. Oth ers have a "pillow" effect, in which the stones have been dressed to a gentle puffiness that provides a softer tex ture. Some walls have large stones in terspersed among smaller; elsewhere one can find polygonal stones with re entrant corners fitting nicely?almost embracingly so?around the outside corners of more conventionally shaped rectangular stones. There is the occa sional triangular stone fitting naturally into a notch formed by its neighbors. In some walls, a jutting piece of the mountain is part of a wall that was built around the natural outcropping. Everywhere there is craftsmanship and artistry in stone that causes the visitor to admire the thoughtful workman ship and smile at the achievement. At regular intervals just below the top slope of now unroofed gables, there are circular cylindrical projec tions of stones cantilevered out of the wall. These are believed to have pro vided lug-like protrusions to which a relatively light timber-and-thatch roof could be secured to the stone structure. These and other details, such as pro jecting stone lugs with holes in them to receive torches and stone juttings that provided means for installing a bar to secure privacy, demonstrate the Incas to have been clever designers, inventors and engineers who antici pated functional needs and planned carefully, for such details could not easily, if at all, have been installed ret roactively into the massive and finely crafted stone walls. Wolfgang Kaehler/Corbis Stonework is largely unadorned but elegant nonetheless, as in this example of a doorway at the royal residence. No matter how carefully designed structurally and aesthetically, the stonework at Machu Picchu is almost completely unadorned with carvings, inscriptions or incisions. There are cer tainly no anthropomorphic gargoyles. Some walls do have niches in which special and symbolic objects likely were placed, but it can be argued that the stone walls, windows and doors Hubert Stadler/Corbis Inca architect/engineers blended mined stonework into natural outcrops, which were sometimes carved to form stairs. 2009 January-February 17</page><page sequence="4">Craig Lovell/Corbis Walls at Machu Picchu are nearly all rectinlinear with the exception of these curved examples at the Temple of the Sun, so named becaue it is thought to have served as a solar observatory. lieved to have served as a solar obser vatory, is in stark contrast to the domi nant straight lines of the rest of the site. The long, straight and character istically slightly inclined nearby wall was called by the Yale historian and explorer Hiram Bingham "the most beautiful wall in America." Archaeology Comes to Machu Picchu It was Bingham who in 1911 was led by local Indians to the "lost city of the Incas" that we now know as Machu Picchu. He re tuned with a team the following year to recover the site from centuries of overgrowth in the rain for est, and in 1913 published his find ings in National Geographic Magazine, in which he wrote that "the Incas were good engineers." If Bingham brought the world's attention to Machu Picchu as an ar chaeological site, it has been the hus band-and-wife team of Kenneth and Ruth Wright, along with the Peruvian archaeologist Alfredo Valencia Zegar ra, who have called special attention to the essential engineering and social features that made the self-contained site workable and livable. When Ruth Wright, a lawyer by training and a for mer Colorado state legislator with in terests in city planning, first visited Ma chu Picchu with her daughters in 1974, she wondered among other things how water was supplied to the remote, el evated site. Upon returning home, she asked her husband, who is president and chief engineer of Wright Water En gineers, based in Denver. He found the need no adornment, for they are beau tiful in their own right by all sense of proportion and workmanship. The cir cular plan of the Temple of the Sun, which is so named because it is be Wolfgang Kaehler/Corbis A water-distribution system consisting of stone canals is a hallmark of Machu Picchu. One spring at the site is thought to be sufficient to supply as many as one thousand people. question professionally interesting and challenging, and the couple sought a permit from the Peruvian government to study the water system of the site. It was not until 1994, after much back and-forth between U.S. and Peruvian officials, that a permit was issued, at which time the Wrights began work ing with Valencia Zegarra on techni cal details of the site's paleohydrology, including its water sources, collection and distribution systems, canals and fountains, drainage, agriculture, and its infrastructure generally. Employees of Wright's firm volunteered their exper tise to the research project. The essential source of water for Machu Picchu is the natural spring located on the mountain's north slope. Perennially replenished by 80 or so inches of rainfall, the volume of springwater was sufficient to support as many as a thousand residents of Machu Picchu in its heyday. Today, af ter the canals and conduits were years ago cleared of silt and vegetation, the flowing water and graceful fountain spouts conducting water down the developed mountain ridge, terrace by terrace, make the static site come alive with motion, light and sound. The stone spouts atop terrace walls and the basins into which they direct the stream are an especially fine feature of the hydraulic accomplishment. The Wrights have made more than a dozen research trips to Machu Picchu, and the principal results of their efforts have been published in the monograph Machu Picchu: A Civil Engineering Mar vel. Their regular visits to Peru also led to their interest in other significant Inca sites, including Tip?n and Moray, which are little known even among many native Peruvians. The archaeological site of Tip?n is only about 13 miles from Cusco, but it takes about a 45-minute bus ride via a narrow switchback dead-end dirt road to reach it. The site is believed to have been used by Inca nobility as an es tate. Unlike Machu Picchu, which is at a lower altitude than Cusco, Tip?n is about 1,500 feet higher than the an cient capital city. It is built not on a ridge but in a notch or ravine between two mountain ridges, which gives it a commanding if channeled view of the valley below. The terraces at Tip?n are much deeper than those at Machu Pic chu, and they thus contain greater ex panses of agricultural soil. The water supply, irrigation and drainage system 18 American Scientist, Volume 97</page><page sequence="5">is also more transparent, because the constrained site is more readily grasp able geometrically and more easily manageable conceptually. As with Machu Picchu, the remote and topographically challenging site of Tip?n worked as a self-sustaining complex because of its reliable source of spring water, which is conducted across and down the terraces via stone-lined canals and graceful fountains. The well drained terraces and the canals not only helped solve the essential problem of stabilizing the mountain slope but also provided workable and irrigable agri cultural land. The outstanding stone work of the retaining walls, which are backed by the ingenious drainage sys tems also found at Machu Picchu, is the most immediately visible remnant of Tip?n as it must have been. The Wrights have also studied Mo ray, another Peruvian site located in the vicinity of Cusco. Moray's most distinctive feature is its concentric ar rangement of nearly circular crop ter races, which descend into bowl-like depressions in the landscape. The stonework and water distribution sys tem are very much like those at Machu Picchu and Tip?n, but the workman ship is more rustic and less refined. There has been much speculation about the original purpose and func tion of Moray, but recent studies indi cate a ceremonial and religious use. Wherever there are terraces on steep inclines, it is desirable also to incorpo rate convenient means of getting from one level to another. Because of its use as a royal estate, Machu Picchu has many grand and carefully made stone stairways, some with multiple steps crafted out of a single large piece of stone. Tip?n, at least in its present con dition, also has such "modern" though less-grand stairways. However, both sites also have what have been termed "flying steps," which consist of a series of large stones cantilevered out of a retaining wall in a stepwise pattern. These cantilevered stones are flattened on their top surface only, their other projecting faces left rough. The ar rangement allows for a quick ascent or descent parallel to the wall separating one terrace from its neighbor. Moray has such flying steps arranged in quite regular spacing patterns, thus making it convenient to move up and down several terraces with a minimum amount of unnecessary walking. The thoughtful planning and placement of Bob Krist/Corbis Agricultural terrace walls typically lean about 5 degrees inward bottom to top, which en hances their ability to resist outward forces. This, combined with very well planned drainage, has allowed these retaining walls to withstand the test of time. the steps' detail further argues for the careful planning and execution of the entire site. The Inca were very good engineers indeed. Based largely on the work of the Wrights and their local archaeological colleagues, and in conjunction with Peruvian partnering organizations, a few years ago the sites of Machu Pic chu and Tip?n were each nominated for the designation of International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. This distinction, instituted about 30 years ago and overseen by the History and Heritage Committee of the Ameri can Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), acknowledges significant world-class achievements that deserve to be rec ognized and brought to the attention of the international engineering com munity and the public. Successful nominations are recommended by the committee to the Board of Direction of ASCE, which awards the designation and authorizes plaques bearing the in signia of both the ASCE and national co-sponsors to be installed at the sites. In the case of Machu Picchu, a bronze plaque has been installed just inside the entrance to the site. The plaque, which bears the logos of the Peruvian Academia Nacional de la Historia and Instituto Nacional de Cultura (INC) in addition to that of ASCE, occupies a position of distinc tion beside the one honoring Hiram Bingham. The plaques for Tip?n?one in Spanish and one in English, both bearing the logos of the INC and ASCE?are currently installed at the Museo Inka; the remoteness and isola tion of the Tip?n site presents a prob lem of security for 30-pound pieces of bronze that could be removed and melted down for other purposes, just as the Spanish conquistadors melted down Inca gold treasures almost half a millennium ago.
