<plain_text><page sequence="1">Camus' s L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading Ben Stoltzfus Over the years, since the publication in 1942 of Albert Camus' s L'étranger, readers have offered a variety of commentaries to explain Meursault's character, his behavior, and his enigmatic shooting of the Arab. Meursault is sometimes viewed as indifferent, callous, and shallow- an individual who is alienated from society and from himself. At other times he is described as a person who is honest to a fault, a man who is unwilling to compromise with the system. René Girard says that "Meursault is the fictional embodiment of the nihilistic individualism expounded in Le Mythe de Sisyphe and commonly referred to as Γ ab- surde/'1 Robert Champigny, however, contends that the values ex- pounded in L'étranger and Le mythe de Sisyphe are not the same.2 Whereas Girard calls him a juvenile delinquent,3 Germaine Brée refers to the "rigorous honesty" and "total sincerity" of a man without "sham or pretense."4 Jean-Paul Sartre says that Meursault "is precisely one of those terrible innocents who shock society by not accepting the rules of its game."5 Camus himself, echoing Sartre, says that Meursault is condemned "because he does not play the game" ("parce qu'il ne joue pas le jeu").6 Champigny, like Sartre, sees Meursault as an inno- cent person who is "declared theatrically guilty by virtue of his in- nocence."7 Meursault has his defenders and his detractors. Monique Wagner is closer to Girard than to Brée, Sartre, and Champigny when she writes that if Meursault does not "play the game" it is not because of his honesty, but because of his ineptness. She concludes that there is little evidence for Meursault's "love for truth" and that he "lets himself die" because he has no desire to go on living in a world whose meaning eludes him. Instead of a "joie de vivre," Wagner sees in Meursault a man who is "constantly dazed, drowsy, sleepy, hot, sweaty, or uncom- fortable."8 Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 31, No. 4, Winter 1989 °1989 by the University of Texas Press, P.O. Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713</page><page sequence="2">Camus's L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 515 Critics tend to side either with Meursault against the judges, or with the judges against Meursault. Indeed, the novel forces the reader to choose between Meursault and his accusers. Arguments abound both for and against the protagonist. Although the court magistrate calls him Mr. Antichrist, Camus says that Meursault is "the only Christ we deserve" ("le seul christ que nous méritions")9- not exactly an endorse- ment of Meursault's character, but certainly also a deliberate slap at the society that will judge and execute him. Louis Hudon says that the murder of the Arab was an accident,10 and many commentators agree with that interpretation. Girard, who is on the side of the judges, says that "the murder ... in a novel otherwise rational and realistic, is a deus ex machina, or rather a crimen ex machina/'11 Brée and Lynes say that the shooting lacks conscious motivation,12 a theme which Camus's psychoanalytical critics pick up on and amplify. Following yet another tack, Albert Maquet writes that "the murder of the Arab is only a pretext; behind the person of the accused, the judges want to destroy the truth he embodies."13 The truth, says Camus, is that "in our societies, every man who does not cry at his mother's funeral, runs the risk of the death penalty" ("dans notre société tout homme qui ne pleure pas à l'enterrement de sa mère risque d'être condamné à mort").14 But that may not be the entire truth. Meursault has shot a man, and were it not for that fact, society would have taken little notice of him. The murder of the Arab is no doubt necessary for dramatic conflict, but it unfolds with the rigorous determinism of Greek tragedy. Carl Viggiani, among others, rejects all rational interpretations of the event, attributing it to the same Fatum that presides over the lives of tragic heroes in ancient literatures.15 Whereas, in another vein, Julian L. Stamm asserts that Meursault "was driven by the irrational homosexual forces within him,"16 J. H. Matthews, less impressed by arguments for Meursault's unconscious motivations, writes, concerning the four addi- tional shots, that "far from being the involuntary gesture of a brute, this is perhaps the first act in which the hero's will manifests itself" ("loin d'être le geste involontaire d'une brute, cette action est peut-être la première où la volonté du héros ait sa part").17 This heightened con- sciousness on Meursault's part is foregrounded even further by Pierre- Louis Rey when he states that Meursault is not as innocent as he ap- pears to be.18 Brian T. Fitch, however, maintains that the only reasons for having Meursault shoot four more times are aesthetic and juridical. Camus, says Fitch, was determined to dramatize, and subsequently parody, Meursault's court trial at the expense of his accusers.19 This is also the theatricality that Champigny refers to. It would be impossible to comment on all the multifarious readings of</page><page sequence="3">516 Ben Stoltzfus L'étranger. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that forty-five years after its publication, the novel continues to fascinate readers of different per- suasions and to generate studies that, in volume, are sufficient to bury Camus's short work under a pyramid of paper. One thing is clear: the many contradictory readings of L'étranger reveal not only the layered complexity of the novel but also the different preoccupations of its readers. Fitch has already summarized the various biographical, socio- logical, metaphysical, political, existentialist, ontological, and psycho- analytical readings of L'étranger in order to highlight his aesthetic explication of the structural unity of the novel's internal contradictions. Alain Robbe-Grillet phrases it aptly, stating that "L'étranger c'est moi," "each one of us has a tendency to create a history of literature that is one's own story" ("chacun d'entre nous à tendance à concevoir une histoire de la littérature qui est sa propre histoire").20 If this is true, L'étranger becomes an "open work," a work that reads the reader, because, in its overdetermined state, it allows commentators to project themselves into the silence of the narrative gap- the silence between the first shot and the four subsequent ones that Meursault pumps into the inert body of the Arab. Whereas Meursault fills the gap with the light of the sun, the magistrate fills it with his need to believe in a Christian God. The death of the Arab always raises two fundamental questions: Why did Meursault kill him? And why, after the first shot, did he shoot four more times into the corpse? Meursault says that it was because of the sun, but his judges, not to mention many readers, do not understand how the sun could influence him to such a degree. Indeed, the question of his guilt or innocence hinges on each reader's reaction to Meursault' s assertion. Those who believe him foreground his honesty, while those who doubt him devalue the sun's complicity. Everything depends on our interpretation of nature's role. However, before proceeding with a Lacanian reading of L'étranger, a reading which, I believe, resolves the question of the sun's part in the death of the Arab, since, until now, there has been no Lacanian exegesis of the novel, it will perhaps be useful to summarize the views of Freudian commentators. Psychoanalytic studies of Camus's works in general and of L'étranger in particular began with an article by Arminda A. de Pichon-Rivière and Wüly Baranger. According to them Meursault's relations with his mother are marked by feelings of sadomasochism, while her death evokes in him reactions of guilt accompanied by schizophrenic symp- toms. In order to escape this sadistic guilt and to rejoin his mother in death, Meursault commits suicide. This, they say, is the meaning of the shooting of the Arab and his failure to defend himself in court.21 Julian L. Stamm interprets the murder of the Arab as a symptom of Meur-</page><page sequence="4">Camus's L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 517 sault's unconscious homosexual sadomasochistic fantasies. The shoot- ing is an ejaculation, and the four additional shots are a discharge of tension that is both aggressive and sexual. The entire scene, says Stamm, is analogous to the "orgiastic peak in the male and the gradual detumescence." Even the glare of the sun "expresses the seething homosexual desires within him [Meursault] ... as well as his passive wish to be penetrated by these rays."22 This is a particularly fanciful ex- ample of the text reading the reader. Whereas the magistrate fills the gap in the narrative with Christianity, Stamm fills the silence between the first shot and the rest with homosexuality. Brée fills it with honesty; Girard with delinquency; Sartre, with Meursault' s refusal to play the game; Champigny, with Epicurean heroism; Fitch, with temporal distance; and Wagner, with ineptness. We each read the book with our own unconscious desire. Alain Costes provides the first Freudian analysis of Camus's work as a whole. Costes stresses the alleged origins of the schizophrenic symp- toms that he finds in an early biographical piece, the one in which Camus describes an assault on his mother in the street one evening by an Arab.23 The incident is interpreted by Costes as an Oedipal phantasm whose reverberations reinforce the author's sadism, masochism, and guilt. Costes concludes that Meursault' s state of mind, before, during, and after the shooting of the Arab, is a projection of Camus's sub- conscious longing for his mother, a need to transcend the void of her silence (she spoke little and seemed reluctant to show her feelings). Camus's discourse in L'étranger, says Costes, "emanates directly and unmistakenly from incestuous desire" ("émane directement du pur désir incestueux").24 Jean Gassin analyzes the underlying symbols and images in Camus's work, and, like Costes, he sees Camus's relationship with his mother as the key. For Gassin, however, the guillotine, like the Arab's knife that flashed in the sun and the piece of shrapnel that killed Camus's father during the war, is the essential symbol because it represents the image of primary castration and death. However, Gassin does not analyze the scene of the shooting of the Arab because he believes that everything about it has already been said.25 A Lacanian reading does, nonetheless, cast a different light on the event and it is useful, therefore, to present the sun's complicity in the shooting of the Arab in Lacanian terms. Costes, while maintaining that a work of art should be interpreted as a dream or as a symptom, but seemingly unaware, in 1973, of Lacan' s Ecrits, wonders how conceptually to connect a spoken discourse with a written one ("la question demeure: comment mener à bien cette transplantation massive de concepts, d'un matériel 'parlé' à un matériel 'écrit'?").26 The exciting and perhaps not surprising aspect of Lacan' s insights into the</page><page sequence="5">518 Ben Stoltzfus structure of language as a linguistic and semiotic system is that they con- firm Freud's intuitions about the unconscious. Thus Costes' s efforts to produce a Freudian analysis of Camus's works only serve to emphasize Lacan' s superior methodology when it comes to reading texts. Lacan' s focus enables us to understand, as Robert Con Davis phrases it, "how language in literary texts is constituted, buoyed up, permeated, and decentered by the unconscious."27 Different systems provide different foci of interpretation. Although my focus will be psychoanalytic, and Lacan' s own readings are Freud- ian, the difference between earlier Freudian readings of L'étranger and mine is that the previous ones, in their pursuit of teleological traumas and symbolic manifestations, have tended to devalue the text in order to privilege pathologically significant moments in Camus's life. A Lacanian reading allows us to focus instead on the author's discursive weave and on the relationship between the reader and the text. The author's life, although relevant, is secondary. Such a strategy allows us to discard the conjectures that Freudian critics sometimes use to shore up an analysis that is frequently speculative. For example, Costes, in explaining the shooting says, "I imagine that for years Camus must have repressed the inadmissible wish to kill this Arab" ("j'imagine que Camus a dû refouler pendant des années le souhait inavouable de tuer cet Arabe").28 Although I am quoting out of context, the words "imagine" and "must have" are enough to cast a shadow over Costes's reasoning. Gassin also engages in speculative statements. Camus, he says, "must have remem- bered the odor of sweat mixed with vinegar from that moment when he had felt the ties binding him to his mother" ("il devait se souvenir de cette odeur mêlée de sueur et de vinaigre, de ce moment où il avait senti les liens qui l'attachaient à sa mère").29 Gassin argues that, in writing the shooting scene, Camus "must have remembered" the evening when Camus's mother is alleged to have been assaulted by the Arab in the streets of Algiers, and Gassin imagines what might have been in Camus's mind when he wrote L'étranger. A Lacanian analysis bypasses such conjectures because the text itself, although in disguise, reveals the content of the author's unconscious. Costes and Gassin are writing about an "incestuous" episode, when, after the attack in the street, Camus spent the night lying on the bed next to his mother. They both refer to this incident as a dramatization of the "primal scene" based on Camus's description of it. Gassin says that "within Camus's phantasm of the primal scene, once the aggressor had fled, it is the subject who found himself in bed with his mother" ("Dans le fantasme camusien de la scène primitive, l'agresseur s'étant enfui, c'est le sujet qui se retrouvait au lit avec sa mère").30 Indeed, Camus's narrative describes with precision the groans, the fever, the sweat, and</page><page sequence="6">Camus' s L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 519 the odors. It is difficult, says Gassin, "not to see the equivalent of a wed- ding night, but with his mother, a night during which the child dis- covers with satisfaction that he has triumphed over his rival" ("Π est bien difficile, dans une optique psychanalytique, de ne pas y voir l'équivalent d'une nuit de noces, mais avec la mère, et où l'enfant trouve la satisfaction supplémentaire de triompher de son rival").31 Costes and Gassin both argue that Camus has triumphed over the Arab by substituting himself for the would-be assailant and has triumphed over his father by supplanting him in the mother's bed. All this is perfectly good, straightforward Freudian and Lacanian theory. I sug- gest, however, that readers need not go to L'envers et l'endroit, or to Costes's, or to Gassin's book to find evidence in L'étranger of the "primal scene." Although they do not identify it specifically, Costes and Gassin both use Charles Mauron's psychocriticism, the methodological approach that emphasizes "significant" juxtapositions of words, sentences, and episodes in different texts (biographical and fictional). Such a method- ology, when reinforced by word counts, such as Paul Fortier's unpub- lished collection, probably gives us insight into the author's psyche and his unconscious intentions. These studies are useful, but they do not ex- plain the novel, and they certainly do not account for its impact on the reader. The shortcomings of conventional Freudian interpretations, which rely so much on biographical material, only serve to highlight the advantages of a Lacanian methodology that emphasizes metaphor and metonymy as tropes within the text's discursive weave. A Lacanian reading foregrounds metaphor and metonymy, thereby eliciting interpre- tive strategies based on the text's poetics rather than on the author's life. It is not an accident that Sigmund Freud erected his theory of the un- conscious on the Oedipus myth, or that Jacques Lacan should find every man's history and destiny written metaphorically and metonymically in the discourse of the Other that derives from it. Because "the un- conscious is structured as a language" (Lacan), the unfolding of each man's destiny occurs on the discursive side of the unconscious, where its pulsive forces are readable and audible. The murder of the Arab may look like a crimen ex machina to Girard, or, if we agree with Costes and Gassin, like Camus's subconscious hostility toward the Arab, but a Lacanian analysis of the incident reveals that it is neither a pretext for the trial, nor a gratuitous event, nor specifically biographical. Although the shooting dramatizes Meursault's opposing personality traits and schizoid tendencies- traits that confirm and explain the many contradic- tory readings of the novel- it also foregrounds the discourse of the Other as the veiled workings of the unconscious, everyone's un- conscious, including the reader's.</page><page sequence="7">520 Ben Stoltzfus Although Pichon-Rivière, Baranger, Costes, and Gassin agree that the shooting symbolizes Meursault's killing of his parents, Viggiani- in a mythical and religious context- says that the sea and the sun constitute religious symbols of the highest antiquity. Water is a primordial female substance from which all forms are born, while the sun is a fecundating element and male principle. Ra, the sun, was an Egyptian god, while the Apollo of ancient Greece drove his chariot across the sky. "A number of signs suggest that in Camus there is an unconscious identification of the mother and the sea who, like the father and the sun, are frequently recurring characters in his work" ("Plusieurs indices suggèrent chez Camus une identification inconsciente de la mère et de la mer, person- nages omniprésents dans son oeuvre au même titre que le père et le soleil").32 These different studies have circled Lacan' s "Letter of the Un- conscious" without actually dealing with it or the role of metaphor in discourse. W. M. Frohock (1950) was perhaps the first to have noted that after having used only fifteen metaphors in eighty-three pages, Camus lavishes twenty-five metaphors on the four pages that describe the shooting of the Arab.33 This is important information because Lacan states that metaphor and metonymy in discourse, like displacement and condensation in dreams, veil the workings of the unconscious. There- fore, Meursault's intense metaphorical description of what is happening to him on the beach has exceptional dramatic value. Robert de Luppé and Albert Maquet believe that this accumulation of metaphors repre- sents an aesthetic lapse, a loss of control on Camus' s part. Camus, they say, has given in temporarily to the exigencies of his character by aban- doning the "style neutre" and the "écriture blanche" of the preceding pages.34 Viggiani, however, believes that Camus is using a highly charged poetic language because Meursault has come up against "the unbridgeable mystery of the universe" ("l'indépassable mystère de l'univers"),35 but Gassin is closer to the mark when he says that "the cymbals of the sun" belong to the category of obsessive metaphors.36 Meursault, and even Camus, may be mystified by the proliferation of metaphor, but what is really at work is the symbolic manifestation of the "primal repression." For Lacan, the homologies of la mère and la mer, as well as "cymbals" and "symbols" are eruptions of the unconscious -tangible manifestations of latent content. Camus had already used the "cymbals of the sun," his lyrical tribute to mother earth and to man's joyful contact with her.37 In Noces (Nup- tials) he personifies nature (mother nature), imbuing her with the same life-death duality that Meursault finds so disquieting. Meursault's "honeymoon" with the sea, with Marie, with the cool of the evening, like Camus's, opposes the harsh sun at noon. Indeed, Meursault is</page><page sequence="8">Camus's L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 521 acutely aware of the sun's extraordinary power. When the magistrate asks him why he shot the Arab, Meursault says it was because of the sun ("c'était à cause du soleil").38 At first, this answer seems odd, and neither the magistrate nor the court can understand how the sun could have been responsible for such an implausible act. As an alibi, the sun elicits laughter in the courtroom. However, Robbe-Grillet gives the sun credence by calling attention to the language that Meursault uses in order to describe the event. Robbe-Grillet says that anthropomorphic metaphors are responsible for the homicide: Meursault pulls the trigger of the pistol because the language he uses to describe his feelings has humanized nature. He shoots because he is unable to keep the necessary distance between objects and himself: The absurd [says Robbe-Grillet] is therefore one aspect of tragic humanism. It is not an assertion concerning the separation of man and objects. It is a love quarrel that leads to the crime of passion. The world is accused of complicity in murder. (L'absurde est donc bien une forme d'humanisme tragique. Ce n'est pas un constat de séparation entre l'homme et les choses. C'est une querelle d'amour, qui mène au crime passionnel. Le monde est ac- cusé de complicité d'assassinat.)39 Without actually identifying the father-mother relationship, Robbe- Grillet's analysis of the role of language is nonetheless apposite because he calls it a "crime of passion" based on jealousy. The displaced object of Meursault's love is the world, since the absurd, as Camus defines it, is that irreparable rift between man and the world- between man's rage to live and the world's inability to fulfill that passion. The absurd is thus neither in man nor in things but in the impossibility of establishing a relationship that is not estranged. This alienation is, in fact, endemic. It affects Meursault's relationship with nature, with society and its codes, and it also contaminates the language that the court will use in order to condemn him: Meursault does not recognize himself in the descriptions of the accused. Also, and unfortunately for him, he is an inarticulate nonconformist who refuses or is unable to defend himself and who is, literally, defined and imprisoned by the encratic language of the society that will condemn him. His lawyer's defense is singularly ineffective against the arguments and intransigence of the state. If an anthropo- morphized language is responsible for Meursault's shooting of the Arab, then surely it is the language of bourgeois ideology that condemns Meursault to death: "the magistrate told me in some weird formula that I would have my head cut off in a public square in the name of the</page><page sequence="9">522 Ben Stoltzfus French people" ("le président m'a dit dans une forme bizarre que j'aurais la tête tranchée sur une place publique au nom du peuple français") (1199). The magistrate says that he cannot understand (nor is the reader given an explanation) why Meursault pumps four more bullets into an inert corpse. All he says is that they were "like four quick raps on the door of misfortune" ("c'était comme quatre coups brefs que je frappais sur la porte du malheur") (1166). One bullet, as Meursault's narrative so strongly implies, is accidental, whereas four more, from the court's point of view, imply premeditation. There is a chasm between them. In- deed, it is this gap in Meursault's story and in the court's interpretation of it that raises so many questions and elicits such widely divergent in- terpretations. The hole in the text opens the door, so to speak, to a Lacan- ian analysis because Meursault's silence, and the court's dramatization of it, is the space in which the repressed material is hidden. Meursault's discourse is a classical example of metaphor veiling the unconscious. It is so obvious, that had Meursault been the original Oedipus, he would have had to blind himself (had not nature, tem- porarily, done it for him) in order to expiate events that were, so to speak, staring him in the face, or, as in this instance, gouging his eyes. It is, as previous commentators have already pointed out, the classical Oedipal triangle. The sun (le soleil in French is masculine) is the father, the sea (la mer in French is feminine, and is also the homonym for la mère, the mother) is the mother, and Meursault is the child. Indeed, Meursault is childlike in his "innocence" and need for immediate satis- factions. The sun, like the father, is sometimes harsh and authoritarian, and it punishes with a slap ("le jour, déjà tout plein de soleil, m'a frappé comme une gifle") (1158). The sea offers Meursault pleasures that he truly enjoys- swimming. But the sea is only one dimension of the earth's abundance. Noces (Nup- tials) provides the backdrop for Meursault's honeymoon on earth. The earth is his true love, and other women, such as Marie, are but one of many satisfactions that constitute his "movable feast." Meursault is willing to marry Marie, if she wishes, but he does not love her. What he does say is that his real love is for "the mother"- for all the physical pleasures that mother-earth provides. The Algerian beach is thus the metaphor for an atavistic relationship, one for which Martha, in the play Le malentendu (The Misunderstanding), is willing to kill. In L'étranger the 2:00 p.m. drama is generated not only by the searing heat of the sun. Far more disturbing for Meursault is the perceived alliance between the mother and the father. The mother, in collusion with the father, is no longer benign, but threatening. "The heat was pressing against me, opposing my advance" ("Toute cette chaleur s'ap-</page><page sequence="10">Camus's L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 523 puyait sur moi et s'opposait à mon avance") (1165). The sea (la mer), like the sun, is a sea of "boiling metal." Meursault's attempt to reach the source, that is, the cool spring, is thwarted by the blade of sunlight (metal) that strikes him on the forehead. The father has struck again, this time with the mother's complicity. The sea, the sun, the sky, and the beach, the sources of Meursault's natural pleasures, are now one united and hostile force that impedes his advance and even threatens to destroy him. Meursault's walk on the beach toward the spring, in spite of the heat, can only be explained as an unconscious desire to find the mother, to slake his thirst at the source. In Noces Camus speaks of walk- ing toward love and desire ("Nous marchons à la recontre de l'amour et du désir"),40 using words and connotations that adumbrate Meursault's walk along the beach toward the stream. The source, like the sea (la mer 'lia mère) also has latent signifieds as mother and as the origin of life. In the end physical oppression by the heat and psychological frustration (the presence of the Arab is an obstacle to the source) combine, explod- ing as a defensive-aggressive act, the pulling of the trigger- the crime of passion and jealousy to which Robbe-Grillet alludes. What is this crime of passion and where does the jealousy come from? Whereas Meursault's narrative is characterized throughout part 1 by its lean, sparse style virtually devoid of metaphors, the end of part 1, by contrast, as Frohock has pointed out, multiplies and anthropomorph- izes them. We have "the ardent breath of the sea" ("La mer a charrié un souffle épais et ardent") (1166) and "the rapid stifled breathing of the sea" ("la mer haletait de toute la respiration rapide et étouffée de ses petites vagues") (1165). The sky opens up "in order to rain down fire" upon him ("Le ciel s'ouvrait sur toute son étendue pour laisser pleuvoir du feu") (1166). Meursault's narration of events makes it clear that something extraordinary is happening to him. Indeed, by the time the sun "strikes" him on the forehead and "gouges" his eyes ("fouillait mes yeux douloureux") (1166), he has come to believe he is under attack. His description of these phenomena has given nature a volition that it does not and cannot have. The sun and the sea (nature) have become actors in the tragedy of Meursault's existence (the stage of his unconscious). However, this complicity between language and nature may not be enough to justify or explain the shooting. There is more than meets Meursault's blinded eyes ("mes yeux étaient aveuglés") (1166). A Lacanian reading demonstrates that, although there may be com- plicity in language, what Robbe-Grillet calls "tragic complicity" ("con- nivence tragique"),41 the real complicity, as in the primal repression, is between father and mother, in this case, metaphorically, between the sun and the sea. Initially, the child's desire for the mother, due to the in- tervention of the father, is repressed, but the anger against the father</page><page sequence="11">524 Ben Stoltzfus and against the self remains. The repression of desire coincides with the child's accession to language. But in the realm of the repressed, the Imaginary (self), the Symbolic (father and mother), and the Real (which resists symbolization completely) continuously reenact the drama of death and desire. It is this language of the unconscious that surfaces and is rendered visible and audible as behavioral symptoms or as meta- phorical discourse. The incidents immediately preceding the shooting are so traumatic for Meursault that metaphor is the only vehicle capable of conveying what he feels or what happens. However, even readers as perceptive as Robbe-Grillet are puzzled by the discrepancy in narrative tone between the events related just before the shooting and Meur- sault's earlier discourse, which is noteworthy for its absence of tropes. It is not narrative inconsistency, as some commentators maintain, but psychological necessity that dictates such an extreme use of figurative language. Although the Arab's presence on the beach is a potential threat, Meur- sault's attention is riveted on the sun reflecting off the Arab's knife. The knife has been transformed into a blade of light, while the sweat that rolls down into Meursault's eyes, hurting them, is also, like the sea, salty. Metonymical slippage transforms sweat and light into a blade of fire. In French the word for blade (la lame) is also the word for wave. The light splashed on the steel and it was like a long shimmering blade [lame] transfixing my forehead. . . . Behind this curtain of tears and salt my eyes were blinded. I was conscious only of the cymbals of the sun clashing on my skull, and, less distinctly, of the blade of light flashing up from the knife, scarring my eyelashes and gouging my eyes with pain. (La lumière a giclé sur l'acier et c'était comme une longue lame étincelante qui m'atteignait au front. . . . Mes yeux étaient aveuglés derrière ce rideau de larmes et de sel. Je ne sentais plus que les cym- bales du soleil sur mon front et, indistinctement, le glaive éclatant jailli du couteau toujours en face de moi. Cette épée brûlante rongeait mes cils et fouillait mes yeux douloureux.) (1166) Because this complicity of language is metaphorical, the word lame (blade) compresses the collusion between the sea and the sun. The wave of sweat that rolls into Meursault's eyes is also the blade of light that gouges them. Although, on the manifest level, nature is blinding him, on the latent and repressed level, it is the mother-father complicity that, once again, threatens Meursault's precarious identity, renewing his fears of death and castration. Instead of the wave "splashing" and the</page><page sequence="12">Camus's L'étranger, A Lacanian Reading 525 blade "gouging," the metaphor can also be read as the wave that "gouges" and the blade that "splashes." Whether wave or blade, the word, by synecdoche, elicits the whole, that is, the sea and the sun. At that point the sky opens up to rain down fire upon him and so the "fire" of the sun and the "boiling metal" of the sea become the blade that is blinding him. Meursault can no longer see, and in self-defense he pulls the trigger because the circumstances are perceived to be life threaten- ing. Indeed, Meursault has reason to blame the sun for the shooting of the Arab, and, when asked, he reports the events as he experienced them. What he does not and cannot know is that his metaphors veil the reenactment of the primal repression, namely, the complicity of the father and the mother, a complicity that, once more, thwarts his desire for the source- the cool spring that will slake his thirst. His thirst is real, but it is also symbolic of his thirst for the mother and explains why, in spite of the heat, he should go walking along the beach looking for her. Physical thirst, by itself, does not explain why he left the cabin on the beach, since water was available there. The cabin was also a place of refuge from the sun. Therefore, compelling reasons must have existed for Meursault' s quest. Although the cool spring may signal the purely imaginary character of his repressed thirst for his mother, it does so, on the linguistic level, by virtue of the fact that a signifier, in this case "the source," can have two signifieds. If we keep in mind that tropes represent a semantic slippage from a present sign(s), the blade (the sun and the sea), to an absent one(s) (the father and the mother), then a Lacanian reading of the events, reactions, and metaphors may be diagrammed in Figure 1.

Thus, in the six circles below, we have S* (the blade, i.e., la lame) overlapping with Si' (the wave, i.e., la lame), with I as the intermediary. The two signifieds (i.e., "blade" and "wave") become the signifiers for two new signifieds (S^ and S^'), namely, the sun and the sea. The fire of the sun coincides with the boiling metal of the sea, and they overlap at Γ . This overlapping is the metaphorical col- lusion between the two. The sun and the sea, in turn, become signifiers for the repressed referents, namely, the father and the mother (Ri and RÏ). The overlapping of their complicity is expressed as Γ ' . Three levels of meaning are expressed simultaneously, two of them present and one absent. The father and the mother are present in the unconscious, but absent from the beach where the tragedy of the unconscious is being played out.

In this case we have an acoustic similarity between the two words that is motivated by a referential resemblance. Within the discourse of the Other, the referent of a literary sign is both present and absent (the Fort! Da! game of the child to which Freud refers).42 In this case recognition of the allusion to the absent referent requires substitut- ing for the Saussurian bar a quasi-triangular definition of the sign (see Figure 3). Figure 3 SIGNIFIED (present) la mer (the sea) /* ' χ ' / ' SIGNIFIER REFERENT (absent &amp; repressed) la mer la mère (the mother) In Figure 3, although the sign (signifier + signified) remains distinct from the referent, the referent, in its contextual and extratextual func- tions, dramatizes the presence of the repressed. On the acoustic level la mer is a metaphor for la mère, but on the repressed level (desire) la mère replaces la mer. The word la mer functions both as metaphor (condensa- tion) and as displacement (metonymy). The word la mer (the sea) is the manifest actant for the latent meaning. The sea (S^) veils the meaning of the mother (S2).43 Reading a trope involves a series of operations that tend to occur simultaneously whenever lexical or acoustic signs suggest an overlap- ping of meaning. Thus, in the two circles in Figure 4, we have S^ (la mer) overlapping with S2 (la mère), with I as the intermediary, either on the lexical-acoustic level or on the functional level: the sea is "the source" of all life as the mother (la mère) is the source of human life. In reading metaphors we cannot overlook the importance of cultural and extratex- tual information. For someone who knows only the dictionary defini- tions of la mer and la mère, the trope would be difficult to understand, especially in terms of the transfer of latent and homonymie associations referring us to desire, discourse, and repression.</page><page sequence="15">528 Ben Stoltzfus Figure 4 / Si / ' S2 ' ' la mer ' ^a m^re I In this context Camus's use of the word la source reinforces the latent associative referents of mother and beginning. This relationship is diagrammed in Figure 5. Figure 5 DENOTATION CONNOTATION SIGNIFIED1 SIGNIFIED2 la source (the spring- present) la source (the beginning) ^--^^^ "^- -·* + SIGNIFIER REFERENT la source la mere (absent) The text represses the reasons for Meursault's return to la source. In- deed, why did he return to the spring after lunch in the full heat of the day? Why did he not stay in the beach house with the others? He says he wanted to get away from the women's voices, but in fact, he has heard and felt the imperious call of the mother. And so, armed, he returns to the source to reclaim his lost rights. Raymond's pistol, a potent male symbol, is still in Meursault's pocket. Moreover, it manifests the power of the phallus because the sun (the father) appropriates it. "When Raymond gave me his revolver," says</page><page sequence="16">Camus's L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 529 Meursault, "the sun glistened on it" ("Quand Raymond m'a donné son revolver, le soleil a glissé dessus") (1164). With his phallus now firmly in place, Meursault runs the gauntlet on the beach (where the mother and the father together oppose his advance) toward the source in order to slake his "thirst," that is, his longing for the Edenic bond with the primal mother who is cool and perhaps at last potentially his. Once more the father (the sun) bars his way, there is a clash of cymbals/symbols (phalluses), the Arab falls, and "the exceptional silence of a beach on which I had been happy" is destroyed ("le silence exceptionnel d'une plage où j'avais été heureux") (1166). Frustration, deception, and anger climax in the pulling of the trigger. The father has triumphed and the law condemns Meursault to the guillotine, where his head will be severed -the ultimate castration. But Meursault regrets nothing. Only hours before his execution, he thinks about his death and his mother's death, and he feels the cool night air, veined with smells of earth and salt. And he feels the mar- velous peace of the sleep-bound summer night that floods through him like a tide ("Des odeurs de nuit, de terre et de sel rafraîchissaient mes tempes. La merveilleuse paix de cet été endormi entrait en moi comme une marée") (1209). In death he will be united with his mother, and, like her, he now feels "ready to start life all over again" ("je me suis senti prêt à tout revivre") (1209). With paradise in sight, Meursault looks for- ward to a crowd of spectators who, on the day of his execution, will greet him "with howls of hatred" ("avec des cris de haine") (1210). At last he will have found the love and the peace of his mother's embrace- the incestuous encounter that we, the spectators, have been taught to execrate. The earth-mother may be Meursault' s true love, but he seems also not to have recovered from the castrating influence of the mythical father. Although he enjoys swimming with Marie in the sea and spouting water, he feels "his mouth burning from the bitterness of the salt" ("j'avais la bouche brûlée par l'amertume du sel") (1149). This residual bitterness has connotations that go far beyond swimming. While sun- ning himself on the buoy with Marie, Meursault places his head on her abdomen, where he feels the pulsing of her being, sensations that adumbrate his quest for the mother as the source of life. Meursault' s behavior reflects an ambivalence that has puzzled critics such as Fitch, who discern Camus's voice lurking behind Meursault' s narrative. The problem, says Fitch, is that the reader has difficulty identifying with a character whose psychology and motivation he or she fails to grasp.44 However, we can restore credibility to this apparent implausibility, if, instead of attributing the concealed voice to Camus, we center it within the discourse of the Other. A Lacanian reading gives us the key to an</page><page sequence="17">530 Ben Stoltzfus understanding of Meursault's psychological opacity. His discourse, whatever else it is, is also the discourse of the Other, and it is this con- cealment that Fitch defines as aesthetic distance.45 A Lacanian reading explains Meursault's duality, not as Camus' s loss of aesthetic control but as the surfacing of the unconscious, that is, of death and desire. The death wish then manifests itself in Meursault's actions as indifference, listlessness, and lack of ambition, even as desire prompts him, simul- taneously, to seek out Marie, the symbolic mother. Meursault spends Sundays on his balcony, a spectator to, not an actor in, the bourgeois activities in the street below. He is not interested in a job promotion or in going to Paris, and he does not cry at his mother's funeral. He is manipulated by the pimp Raymond, and it is, in part, this association that condemns him. Meursault says yes to Raymond's re- quests that he write a letter to Raymond's mistress because it is too much trouble to say no. Saying no requires more effort than a partially inebriated Meursault can muster, but he also always takes the path of least resistance. Meursault is like a cork bobbing in the sea, pushed this way and that by whatever social, emotional, and physical currents come his way. If we compare the significance of the words "yes" and "no" in Camus's L'homme révolté (The Rebel), we begin to understand the distance that separates Meursault from Camus's metaphysical persona which, although rebelling, affirms a collective cogito- &amp; reasoned affir- mation of an essentialist attitude that gives meaning to their rebellion: "I rebel, therefore we are" ("Je me révolte, donc nous sommes").46 Meursault seems pathologically incapable of exercising his will (let alone of formulating the premises of collective rebellion or acting upon them), a symptom, surely, of psychological impotence, of a spirit broken by the name of the father (te non/nom du père). He is not a committed hero; he cannot defend himself in court, has nothing to say, although it is a matter of life and death, feels like a stranger at the proceedings, and has the impression that the court is talking about someone else, not him. Resistance, let alone rebellion, seems futile. He has not taken the leap into commitment, which is the second stage of the existential hero. Such is the meekness, humility, and poverty of mind of "the only Christ we deserve." The trial mirrors the events as defined and described by the court, and the reader is, no doubt, as surprised as Meursault is to learn that "he has buried his mother with a criminal heart" ("j'accuse cet homme d'avoir enterré une mère avec un coeur de criminel") (1192). Is that possible? How could the court get away with so outrageous a statement, unless, of course, there were some truth to residual feelings of guilt that we all share. Are we not guilty of coveting our mothers and wishing for the death of our fathers? Fyodor Dostoevsky, adumbrating Freud and</page><page sequence="18">Camus' s L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 531 Lacan, may not have been the first to state that we all secretly desire the death of our fathers- hence the guilt. Camus himself sets up the paral- lelism between the man who is accused of patricide and Meursault's alleged matricide. Indeed, the magistrate implies that because Meur- sault is a heartless and soulless creature ("je n'en avais point, d'âme, et que rien d'humain, et pas un des principes moraux qui gardent le coeur des hommes ne m'était accessibles") (1195), he is as guilty of killing a father as he is of burying his mother with a criminal heart. Desire and guilt- two of the elements that Lacan refers to- implicate all of us, and, in the context of the primal repression, we are all guilty. L'étranger is a novel that mirrors the Other in all of us, and that is the reason, I believe, for its fascination and haunting endurance. In part 2, after Meursault is condemned to die, he finds his tongue and, instead of only describing objects and events from the outside, as he had in part 1, he begins to reason like a philosopher. He accedes to language in another classical illustration of the Lacanian concept of the primal repression. The child discovers language along with desire and death. The Law denies the infant's desire for the mother, thereby sym- bolically castrating the child. This castration and repression is internalized as a death wish directed at the father and as a death of the self. Meur- sault's indifference to everything except mother-earth is the symptom of the death of the self from which he has never recovered. So Meursault is condemned to die, and, like the child acceding to lan- guage, even as it represses the death of the self, Meursault's discourse assumes a giant epistemological and ontological leap. He discourses on life, death, freedom, and the self. Whereas in part 1 he was living the "absurd," in part 2 he describes it. Whereas in part 1 he was living as a free man, in part 2 he describes what it means not to be free. Whereas in part 1 he seemed indifferent to his mother's death, in part 2 he accepts death calmly but not indifferently. When questioned by the priest about life after death, he says that he would like to be able to remember this one ("Une vie où je pourrais me souvenir de celle-ci") (1208). Meursault says that he has no regrets, that he accepts the consequences of his acts (these characteristics define him as an authentic being), and he assumes the Other in himself. While waiting to die he looks up at the starry sky: I opened myself to the tender indifference of the world. To feel it so like me, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I'd been happy, and that I was happy still. (Je m'ouvrais pour la première fois à la tendre indifférence du monde. De l'éprouver si pareil à moi, si fraternel enfin, j'ai senti que j'avais été heureux, et que je l'étais encore.) (1209)</page><page sequence="19">532 Ben Stoltzfus Meursault is calm after his stormy encounter, after venting his anger at the priest who has tried to talk to him of God, repentance, and the afterlife- the very concepts that Meursault rejects- because, for him, they have no significance. But Meursault' s anger is significant because it is only the second time in the novel that it has exploded. The first time was on the beach, when he pumped the four extra bullets into the Arab. Is there a connection to be made between a priest who calls Meursault "my son" and asks him to call him "father" and Meursault's reaction to the sun (the mythical father and the repressed father) on that fateful afternoon when he shot the Arab? When the heat is on, so to speak, whether it is physical or metaphysical, Meursault's anger surfaces. His anger is the symptom that identifies the father as the source of his disturbance. It also proves that there is one fundamental exception to his fatigue, listlessness, and indifference: the prohibition of the father. The law of nature is death, and death is the essential meaning of an absurd world: "Men die and they are not happy" ("Les hommes meurent et ils ne sont pas heureux"), says Camus's crazed although lucid Caligula.47 However, the law of the father is also death- the sym- bolic death of the self- and that is the meaning of the primal repression. Society's laws can also be lethal, and criminals are executed in the name of the law. Camus's works synthesize the natural, social, and psycho- logical laws of existence into one irrepressible principle: death. Except for those privileged moments when Meursault comes in contact with the mother and is happy, he is the puppet of the father. By using the code words "father" and "son"- by invoking the law- the priest unwitting- ly opens the sluice gates to Meursault's repressed anger, frustration, and resentment. This anger, directed at the father and the law illumi- nates the unconscious impulses that goad him to shoot the sun, which is the "mythical father," if not "our Father in heaven." The unusual quality of Meursault's narrative with which part 1 ends, with its atypical metaphors, is thus not inconsistent with his state of mind and emotional turmoil. Since the latent content of the unconscious can manifest itself as discourse only in disguised form, Meursault's metaphors are the symptoms of a profound disturbance. He is reenact- ing the trauma of the primal repression when the unity in the mirror between mother and infant was cleaved by the father. The father asserts his rights, claims the mother, and forces the child to recognize an identity that will forever be alienated. The strangeness of this Other and its relationship to the superego will also determine the degree of alienation each person feels within the self and from society. Meursault's aliena- tion from society, as his behavior clearly shows, is extreme. The murder of the Arab forces society to take note of his action and, consequently, in order to understand it, to examine his other actions. The magistrate does</page><page sequence="20">Camus' s L'étranger: A Lacanian Reading 533 not like what he discovers. Meursault's values are perceived as disrup- tive, antisocial, and destabilizing. This is why he is accused of burying his mother with the heart of a criminal. A paternalistic society, empha- sizing law and order, cannot abide a man who appears to be subverting that order. Meursault's penchant for living in the present, his inability to resist immediate satisfactions will offend the court which places such heavy emphasis on decorum. The magistrate says that " 'the emptiness that one discovers in this man's heart is a chasm ready to engulf society '" ('"le vide du coeur tel qu'on le découvre chez cet homme de- vient un gouffre où la société peut succomber'") (1195). He smokes a cigarette at his mother's funeral, drinks café au lait, and does not cry. He goes to a Fernandel film and laughs, and he begins a liaison with a woman when he should have been in mourning. The murder of the Arab is indeed the pretext that will allow the law to proscribe behavior that subverts its structures. Roland Barthes uses the term arrogance to describe the self-assurance of an ideology that is arbitrary, but which, nonetheless, believes in its inviolability.48 Meursault's hedonism (he is responsive to physical pleasures such as swimming, eating, lovemaking) places him in the mother's camp, not the father's. The father represents the harshness of the law- striving, ambition, convention, obedience- virtues to which Meursault is indif- ferent. He marches to another drummer: he is attuned to nature's rhythms, not society's expectations. He is in harmony with a mother who tends to be permissive, tolerant, and giving. Camus's references to man's honeymoon on earth are not gratuitous.49 They are the yearning of a child who longs for the pleasures and comforts of the mother's body. As a metaphor, Noces is the disguised image of the mother and the nostalgia of a child's incestuous desire. At night Meursault's behavior, patterned after the mother's ("je m'ouvrais pour la première fois à la tendre indifférence du monde") (1209), opposes the harshness of pater- nalistic authority- the sun at noonday. No wonder Barthes calls U étranger a solar novel. For millennia the rule of the father has been responsible for feelings of castration, death, and inadequacy: indeed, the incest taboo is one of many legacies. Meursault's accusers may denounce him, but the "cymbals" of the sun suggest that the blade of the guillotine, like the Arab's knife, will have to flash once more in order to punish him for violating, even uncon- sciously, the taboo of incest. Incest is the latent and repressed content of Camus's novel, and it continues to fascinate readers who, as in a mirror ("this is you"), recognize in Meursault's actions the image of Oedipal desire.
