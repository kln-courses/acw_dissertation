<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aristotle on Necessary Verticality, Body Heat, and Gendered Proper Places in the Polis: A Feminist Critique JUDITH M. GREEN Feminist critics have charged that Aristotle's mistaken and harmful remarks about women and slaves show inconsistency or bias-driven arbitrariness. However, this analysis shows that these remarks function within a consistent and coherent theoret- ical corpus. Thus, both Aristotle's hierarchical and dualistic first principles and the methodology on which his entire corpus is based must be unreliable. Moreover, consistency and coherence must be insufficient warrants of theoretical insightfulness. Aristotle's mistakes suggest caveats for feminist philosophical reconstruction. I. Introduction In recent years considerable feminist attention has focused on Aristotle's writings, especially his Politics and De Generatione Animalium, because the views about the natures and social places of women and slaves that he expresses there are particularly blatant and historically harmful examples of distortion. For the purpose of showing an inconsistency or a bias-driven arbitrariness in these views, Elizabeth V. Spelman, Lynda Lange, and other feminist critics have written original and insightful analyses linking Aristotle's comments on these subjects to some of his more general arguments (Spelman 1983, 1988; Lange 1983). For example, in a short essay that focuses primarily on what she sees as a tension between De Generatione Animalium and the main claims of the Politics, Rhoda H. Kotzin suggests that "the anti-women, stereotyped, prejudiced things that Aristotle says about women in the Politics do not do him credit, and ... the'place' that he finds for adult free women in the household is not demanded by the rest of his philosophy but, in fact places some strain on it" (Kotzin 1989). Hypatia vol. 7, no. 1 (Winter 1992) ? by Judith M. Green</page><page sequence="2">Judith M. Green If Aristotle's comments about women and slaves are best regarded as incon- sistent or arbitrary aberrations from an otherwise well-founded theoretical vision, critics might rightly argue that these feminist essays display a certain rude pettiness in focusing so much attention on marginal imperfections in the work of so great a thinker that he was simply referred to as "the Philosopher" by many famous writers of the late Middle Ages. Undeniably, Aristotle was one of the foundational architects of the Western world, a thinker whose philosophical vision continues to function as one of the central pillars in Western thought, upholding myriad theoretical realms as well as basic institu- tions of contemporary life. Thus if his comments about gendered proper places are, indeed, marginal imperfections in an otherwise sound philosophical corpus, perhaps feminists would be well-advised to make their objections politely and then move on to employing his powerful conceptual apparatus to make marginal sex-egalitarian alterations in our otherwise well-ordered phil- osophical and social world. How should we, as later-generation feminist readers, think of Aristotle's comments on women and slaves? Is this a case of Homer nodding that polite and generous commentators should overlook? Or might these comments be symptomatic of a deeper disease that pervades the entire Aristotelian corpus? Might they be clues to the mysterious basis of the Western world's assignment of unequally valued hierarchical places in the polis to persons who seem alike in sharing the form and the dignity of being human? The thesis of this essay is two-fold. Closer examination shows that Aristotle's remarks about women and slaves are conclusions of a consistent and coherent theoretical corpus, so that the theoretical first principles and general philo- sophical methodology on which they are based must be regarded as unreliable. On the metatheoretical level, this analysis suggests that consistency and coherence must be regarded as insufficient warrants of theoretical soundness. Greater clarity about the inadequately supported foundational assumptions and methodological errors that led Aristotle to these incorrect and harmful conclusions can help feminist theorists to avoid similar mistakes and harms in philosophical and cultural re-construction. Examining the Aristotelian corpus in search of causes of the gender dis-ease in the Politics leads us to look at fundamental relationships among his ideas in a new light, bringing patterns into the foreground that many commentators have overlooked and might still deny exist. As will be shown in the following analysis, for Aristotle, "the masculine" and "the feminine" are principle- bundles of complementary oppositions in all of Nature, the most fundamental value-creating differences from which other value-creating differences arise. These complementary principle-bundles in all their embodiments are corre- lated by what I call "the principle of necessary verticality," which serves two purposes: (1) it creates the coherence within compounds that allows them to remain unified and to achieve their function, and (2) it generates a dynamic 71</page><page sequence="3">Hypatia of up-ness following down-ness that allows all things within Nature to achieve their telos of an eternal circular motion like that of the celestial beings beyond the lunary sphere.2 Consistently with his analysis of the operation of these principles in his philosophical and scientific works, Aristotle attributes the subordinate proper places of women and slaves within the polis to their participation in the subordinate "feminine" principles of Nature. Aristotle's various extant works are linked into a consistent and coherent whole by a uniform methodology, by internal references to his other works within each work, and by the same set of theoretical first principles brought to bear again and again in analyzing each new subject. Thus the problem about gendered proper places in Aristotle's polis must go beyond distortion in his comments about women and slaves to problems in his methodology and ultimately, to problems in his allegedly unarguable and obvious first principles about the nature of the cosmos and the human place within it. II. Principles of Place in Aristotle's World: Physics to Politics Athens, the Greek capital city of learning to which the provincial young man Aristotle made his way in the fourth century B.C.E., evinced in the way its rugged and vertical landscape dominated the human community's patterns of location and land usage a paradigmatic example of what he came to see as a principle of necessary verticality governing the relationship between "the masculine" and "the feminine" in all of Nature: the steeply sloping land shaped and directed the life of the human community. Throughout his writings of the later years, after he returned to Athens to lead the Lyceum, Aristotle studied the pattern of principles by which Nature orders landscape-replicating rela- tionships of up-ness and down-ness, activity and passivity, hotness and cool- ness, form-making and form-receiving, and dominance and subordination. The vision he worked out in these mature works treats all of Nature, including the human community, as governed by these principles, which operate variably only to the extent that they operate within the different substances of which differing natural kinds are composed in order to fulfill their natural purpose or telos. None of these later works is self-contained, nor are the political works taken together complete. As Aristotle himself points out, the background of his other scientific and philosophical works must be understood and assumed as prior argumentation for his applied political works, including the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics, as well as the Politics, within which his extended argument about gendered proper places reaches its conclusion.3 At a deeper level, all of Aristotle's mature works are interlinked by a uniform method and a common set of first principles, including bundles of dualistic masculine and feminine principles and a principle of necessary verticality, which directs their interaction in all of Nature, including within the polis. For Aristotle, our bodily 72</page><page sequence="4">Judith M. Green substance makes us part of Nature (he Physis), the realm of all things that move and change, and thus, we are governed to a great extent by any general principles that govern all of Nature. Though he does not dwell on this idea in the Physics or the Politics, it is the background assumption underlying his remarks about humans in the intervening works that complete his philosophy of Nature, including De Anima, De Partibus Animalium, and De Generatione Animalium.4 Aristotle's belief that there are such general principles governing truth-bear- ing thought as well as Nature is not based on simple or naive anthropomorphic projection of observed human socio-reproductive differences onto the cosmos. Rather, it is based on his multistage philosophical methodology, which he first developed in his five logical works, his Organon or tool, and continued to refine in subsequent works. Logico-philosophical criticism of earlier observations and theories concerning both natural phenomena and conceptual categories, expressed both in common opinion and in the works of earlier "great thinkers" of the Greek culture, was to be followed by imaginative induction leading to synthetic general principles that Aristotle believed could withstand his criti- cisms of earlier views. These general principles of thought and of Nature were then proposed as the cause of observed differences between men and women, as well as between masters and slaves, ruling classes and ruled classes, and parents and children. If further observations tended to confirm the general principles, they were to be treated as true and insightful. Aristotle's reasons for believing that there must be such general principles of Nature can be summarized as follows: 1. We have good reason to suspect that there must be such general principles of Nature because the wise authors of the great books in our tradition (Hesiod, Homer, Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Democritus, et al.) agree on this point, though they disagree on what these general principles are. 2. Moreover, popular (Greek) opinion is agreed on the claim that there are general principles of Nature, and when popular agreement is universal, it must be correct. 3. Our model of understanding and explanation as developed in the Organon requires analysis and synthesis to arrive at such general principles in any realm of thought; without general principles, one can neither understand nor explain. 4. Such general principles seem to fit our subsequent observations. In all or nearly all of his extant works, including the Politics, Aristotle begins the process of clarifying his questions and moving toward definitions of key 73</page><page sequence="5">Hypatia terms by summarizing and analyzing what had been said on the subject by Plato and the pre-Socratic philosophers, the poets, and sometimes the historians and the Hippocratic school of medicine.5 The "universally shared" popular beliefs that Aristotle seems to regard as reliable are of the most basic and general kind that Jaakko Hintikka (1967) has called the "conceptual presuppositions of Greek political theory." Such shared presuppositions in theoretically refined form provide the starting place in "the obvious" for Aristotle's explanations of how and why observable results occur as they do in the various fields of knowing.6 According to this model, an adequate theoretical explanation should allow one to deduce predictive implications, so that one can check the truth of the theoretical first principles by observing whether there is "positive fit" between one's predictions and the things and relations observable in Nature.7 By following his "usual method," Aristotle discovered a set of general principles of Nature that he outlined in the Physics and applied in his later works of natural and political philosophy.8 In Physics II.i.193a2-9, as in the Posterior Analytics and the Politics, Aristotle argues that the philosopher must start from "the obvious" instead of trying to prove it. But at the same time, it is important to ground theory in the world of observation and experience (the final element of his method as outlined above) instead of engaging in detached thought experiments that treat the logically possible as the naturally possible. The general principles of Nature that Aristotle derives from this method in the Physics concern the systematic interaction of dualistic oppositions, such as activity and passivity, up-ness and down-ness, heat and cold, form-making and form-receiving. According to the Physics, these dualistic oppositions are sys- tematically organized into principle-bundles; that is, activity tends to go with up-ness, heat, and form-making among natural things that have any one of these characteristics, whereas passivity tends to go with down-ness, cold, and form-receiving ( 188a26ffand 190b29ff). Correlatives tend to embody opposite dualistic principle-bundles that determine their proper places relative to one another within a frame of reference (205a10-12). Natural relative up-ness and down-ness is the fundamental determinant of a thing's proper place, and this characteristic is determined by the dualistic principle-bundle that is embodied in the thing's substance (208b9-25 and 21 la4-5). Aristotle gives no name to this fundamental principle of location according to relative natural up-ness and down-ness that he claims organizes and directs the activity of correlatives and compounds throughout all of Nature. This may be why many commenta- tors have failed to notice it. Nonetheless, it is clearly a fundamentally impor- tant principle: it is the one I refer to throughout this essay as the principle of necessary verticality. Aristotle develops this principle primarily in Physics III-IV, in which he argues that everything in Nature (he Physis) has a proper place (topos), an 74</page><page sequence="6">Judith M. Green immediate envelope of location within whatever kind of entity it is that functions as its natural container. A sensible body or substance must be situated somewhere, and any given body has some proper site, which is the same for the part as for the whole.... (Phys. III.v.205a9-11) Because there is more than one substance, things have different locational tendencies relative to one another. If... the universe is not all homogeneous, then the sites proper to its unlike constitutents are distinguishable. . . . (Phys. III.v.205a20-21) The Greek word topos is a broad term with several different shades of meaning, including place (location) and space (extension) of a material thing, as well as the location of an idea or a passage within a text (Wickstead and Corford in Aristotle 1929, 1934). As Aristotle develops his analysis in the Physics, "proper place" has two aspects: a thing's immediate location and its natural relational location relative to things of other kinds on the basis of the locational tendencies (i.e., natural up-ness or down-ness) within the sub- stances of which they are composed. In the first of these two senses, the proper place of each thing is its immediate container, though every container is itself contained. Thus, for example, the proper place of wine is the wineskin or jug that immediately contains it, though the wine may also be within a building, a city, a country, and the earth's atmosphere. The kind of container that is naturally proper to the wine (the wineskin or the jug) is one that suits its nature and purpose. When this analysis is applied to human beings, as the discussion below will show it is in the Politics, every person's proper place is within a household, which may also be within a polis, which may also be within Greece, and so on. At the same time, different things have natural tendencies to assume different relative proper places within a shared frame of reference because of the properties of the substances of which they are composed. Some substances tend to assume a place that is naturally upward relative to other substances, as, for example, air is naturally upward relative to earth. Every sensible body has either weight or lightness, and if heavy, tends downwards and, if light, upwards.... (Phys. III.v.205b25- 28) It is because of differences in substance, as will be shown below, that naturally free men tend to have a proper place within the household that is upward relative to women and slaves. This relativity of proper places based upon partially changeable characteristics of compound substances helps us to under- stand both how there can be exceptions to Aristotle's generalizations about 75</page><page sequence="7">Hypatia men, women, and slaves, and also how proper places in the household and the polis can change over the course of the human life cycle. In Physics IV, Aristotle analyzes this natural locational up-ness and down- ness in substances in terms of a directional principle relative to the stationary center of the earth, which is the center point for the spherical vault of heaven. Heavy elements are those that have a greater tendency toward the center, and light things are those that have a greater tendency toward the "inner celestial verge" (212a21-28). In Physics II.ix, Aristotle had claimed that a certain kind of matter is necessary to achieve a particular form. His view seems to be that the relative proper places of things in Nature are determined by the locational tendencies of the substances that are necessary to embody their forms. Obviously, motion or change in place is possible, and this is one of the most fundamental problems the philosopher of Nature must explain. According to Aristotle, some movements occur because of the action of heat from celestial friction with the earth's atmosphere. All mechanical movement is due to the action on a body of some other body, whereas animated movements (including those of the celestial spheres) are due to desires originating in each living being's nature (physis). The telos that directs the dynamic of up-ness and down-ness within the living things of Nature is their developmental goal of continuously rising toward the celestial spheres and imitating their eternal circular movement (Phys. II.i &amp; vii-viii; Phys. IV.xiv.223b14-35; Phys VIII; Wickstead and Cornford in Aristotle 1929, 1934). Thus a principle of neces- sary verticality operates as a dynamic principle of growth and change within the substances of all living things in Nature as they embody their forms, functioning to direct their development upward toward this ultimate telos. No individual thing within Nature can sustain this upward developmental process indefinitely; each must eventually begin to move downward. More particularly, no living thing could sustain a perpetual cycle of growth, decay, and regrowth alone. Therefore, living things, like all of Nature, are organized into correlative relationships in which the interacting dualistic principles embodied by the interacting correlative partners help them jointly to achieve their telos of upward movement toward the highest level their form and substance allow. Aristotle applies this argument in Politics I to show why there is a universal tendency within all human beings to form reproductive pairs, households, communities, and ultimately, the polis: only by joining together in such compounds can mortal humans continue to move upward and achieve eternal regeneration on the model of the eternal circular movement of the celestial spheres. As we might expect in light of the uniformity of Aristotle's method, the interconnectedness of his texts, and his argument in the Physics for the necessity of dynamic interaction between opposites to achieve this telos within all things of Nature, correlative relationships between the naturally upward and the naturally downward arc a central element of his analysis in many of 76</page><page sequence="8">Judith M. Green his other works. In chapter 7 of the Categories, Aristotle discusses a variety of correlative relationships, including the naturally unequal one between master and slave. Metaphysics V.xv analyzes the correlative relationship as including that between what can heat and what can be heated and, in general, between the active and the passive. The hierarchical typology of friendships in the Nicomachean Ethics includes the naturally unequal correlative relations between wife and husband, as well as between master and slave. Likewise, Politics I.iii refers to the subject at hand as the theoretical attempt to examine the household in terms of its fewest possible elements; it then describes these elements in terms of three naturally unequal, hierarchically ordered correlative relations, including those between husband and wife, parent and child, and master and slave. Thus, Aristotle's analysis in the Physics of the tendency of these opposite principles of correlationship to occur in dualistic principle-bun- dles (e.g., heat with up-ness with form-making with activity, as opposed to cold with down-ness with form-receiving with passivity) allows us to see all of these other discussions of correlatives as exhibiting a single set of theoretical prin- ciples of Nature operating in various domains. In all of these discussions, dualistic principle-bundles are dynamically interconnected and directed by a principle of necessary verticality. Aristotle's general method, the interdependence of the parts of his overall philosophical vision, and his fundamental principles of Nature can be seen clearly at work in his Politics. Book I, chapter 1 begins with a comment about what observation tells us, continues with a summary and criticism of a view about relationships within the polis that was held by Plato and others, and concludes with a statement of the method to be used in demonstrating the writer's point. Our point will be made clear if we proceed to consider the matter according to our normal method of analysis [italics added]. Just as, in all other fields, a compound should be analyzed until we reach its simple and uncompounded elements (or in other words, the smallest atoms of the whole which it constitutes), so we must also consider analytically the elements of which a polis is composed. We shall then gain a better insight into the difference from one another of the persons and associations just mentioned; and we shall also be in a position to discover whether it is possible to attain a systematic view of the general issues involved.9 Aristotle's reference to "our normal method of analysis" in this early passage from the Politics is only one such explicit allusion to his earlier works. Another is the passage in Politics II.i in which he explicitly alludes to Nichomachean Ethics V.v in arguing that the welfare of the polis requires proportionate equality in civic contribution and civic reward: 77</page><page sequence="9">Hypatia A consequence follows [from this conception that the polis is composed of different elements, mutually exchanging different services in virtue of different capacities]. It is that the well-being of every polis depends on each of its elements rendering to the others an amount equivalent to what it receives from them. This is a principle already laid down in the Ethics. It is a principle which has to be observed even among free and equal citizens [in spite of the fact that, as such, they appear to be identical in kind]. In addition, there are many implicit allusions to the earlier works in Aristotle's abbreviated summaries of the arguments concerning his claims that one element rules and another is ruled within any compound, that all human action aims at happiness (eudaemonia), and that the soul naturally rules over the body. Though he does not name them as such in his commentary on the Politics, Trevor J. Saunders recognizes both Aristotle's dualistic principle-bundles and his principle of necessary verticality-including its expression as the necessity of a pattern of dominance and subordination, ruling and being ruled-that governs these correlative relationships within the polis: The relationship of master and slave conforms to a broad pattern found universally in nature in the widest sense: bet- ter/worse, male/female, man/beast, mind/body, rational/irratio- nal, ruler/ruled. Such a pattern makes obvious sense to Aristotle, who justifies it teleologically by its beneficial results: to be ruled is to the slave's advantage, and is to that extent just.... Some admitted exceptions to the pattern do not make him doubt its essential validity: presumably he finds it sufficient for the purposes of his argument that nature achieves her ends only "for the most part" (as he often concedes in other con- texts). (Aristotle, 1981) As Saunders rightly points out, Aristotle's Politics reflects the general principles of Nature that were uncovered and analyzed in the earlier logical, scientific, and political works. Perhaps because it is difficult for us as modern readers to see ourselves largely as creatures of Nature, Saunders does not bring out Aristotle's sense of the natural necessity of inequality in human correlative relationships, emphasizing instead their mutual advantage.10 However, Aristotle himself presents the unequal relationships within the polis as not only mutually advantageous, but also necessary. Moreover, it is this necessity of political inequality that he presents first and with least argument, perhaps because it follows from the principle of necessary verticality that runs throughout all of his works on Nature and that accords so well with the shared Greek common sense. 78</page><page sequence="10">Judith M. Green Ruling and being ruled not only belongs to the category of things necessary, but also to that of things expedient; and there are species in which a distinction is already marked, immedi- ately at birth, between those of its members who are intended [by nature] for being ruled and those who are intended to rule .... In all cases where there is a compound, constituted of more than one part but forming one common entity-whether the parts be continuous or discrete-a ruling element and a ruled can always be traced. (Pol. I.v) In this passage is encapsulated the application of the general principles of the Physics to the Politics: human beings are not self-sufficient atoms but correlative elements of larger natural compounds that allow us cooperatively to fulfill the upward telos that directs the development of each person. We are different from birth-presumably different in substance-in ways that suit us to vertically ordered relative proper places within shared frames of reference, the household and the polis. Our cohesiveness and our cooperative success in achieving our shared telos depend upon each element fulfilling the correlative role indicated by his or her proper place. As compound beings within nature composed not only of bodily stuff but also of immaterial nous (the divine mental substance of which humans share a small part), human beings collectively have a particular proper place in the cosmos, which is both within the family without which continued life, includ- ing reproduction, is impossible for them, and within the polis, without which the good life is impossible for them. However, according to Aristotle, our proper places and correlative roles within each of these locations should not be understood as the mere co-occupancy of form-sharing equals. Instead, women and slaves are naturally subordinate beings relative to free men. Unlike contemporary liberal theorists, who tend to treat all human beings as funda- mentally alike and fundamentally equal beneath the skin, Aristotle regards the differences between men and women, like those between natural masters and natural slaves, as significant modifications in substance without which the correlative relationship of dominance and submission that leads to the devel- opment and regeneration of the human species would be impossible. He argues that the relationship between husband and wife, like that between master and slave, is naturally a vertically or hierarchically ordered one, being based on differences in nature; that is, the tendencies within the particular bodily and mental substance combinations of which they are composed determine the social places for which each is naturally fit. Within the human social com- pounds, free men are thus "intended by Nature" to exercise permanent leadership over women and slaves, both in the home and in the polis. This is free men's proper place and role relative to women and slaves, whose proper place is in the home, giving their efforts to care of the family under the 79</page><page sequence="11">Hypatia direction of their husbands and masters. If the society as a whole and the individual members who compose it are to experience "the good life," Aristotle argues, each member must assume his or her proper place and fulfill the role for which he or she is naturally gifted. However, even though the principles of the Physics, especially the principle of necessary verticality, lead us to expect unequal correlative relationships in the polis, nothing that is explicitly stated there explains why political inequal- ity should follow lines of sex. Why should there not be female philosopher- kings, as Plato suggested? Moreover, nothing that is explicitly stated in the Physics or the Politics allows us to systematically interrelate the subordination of women with the subordination of slaves, some of whom are female. To understand how all of these parts fit together within the Aristotelian corpus, we must add missing clues from the biological writings. When we do this, implicit meanings emerge that show us that the principles of the Physics themselves are gendered, and that the reproductive needs of the complex human animal-kind determine how these gendered principles are played out in patterned substantial deviations of women and slaves from the human form as embodied in naturally free men. These reproductively motivated biological differences then form the basis for a single, vertically-ordered hierarchy of gendered proper places in the polis, organized in terms of dominance and subordination, up-ness and down-ness, on the basis of the extent to which an individual human being's compound of material and immaterial substances embodies the form that all human beings share. III. Regenerating the Polis: From Body Heat to Gendered Proper Place Understanding why Aristotle believed that the proper place of "masculine" men is naturally vertical or upward relative to "feminine" women, slaves, and children requires using the dualistic principle-bundles and the principle of necessary verticality from the Physics to fill what seem to be gaps in his argument about human reproductive relationships in De Generatione Animal- ium, and then applying these results to fill the gaps in the argument in the Politics. Aristotle claims that the fundamental bioreproductive differences between men and women that he focuses on in De Generatione Animalium derive from the need of the species to perpetuate itself. In the terms of the Physics, each of us is naturally motivated to collaborate with other human beings in accordance with the principle of necessary verticality as it relates to our form and substance in order to achieve our collective telos of maintaining an eternal circular motion (up-ness following down-ness) like that of the celestial beings beyond the lunary sphere. This is the teleological background for Aristotle's claim in Politics I that humans have a natural tendency to form unequal, heterosexual, reproductively focused unions that become the foun- dation for families, households, villages, and ultimately the polis. A further 80</page><page sequence="12">Judith M. Green claim in De Partibus Animalium that the value of living creatures is proportional to the extent of their participation in the masculine principles forms the background justification for Aristotle's prescription in his political writings that the life energies of all other groups within the polis be directed toward creating the conditions for flourishing of form-bearing, naturally masterful, masculine males: "Noblest of all are those whose blood is hot" (De Part. 648a10-15). In shaping his bioreproductive argument, Aristotle seems to ask the ques- tion, why are there women? Put another way, why are free men, who most fully embody the human form, unable to regenerate themselves? His answer is that without correlative sex differences a species of higher animals like ourselves could not regenerate itself-there would be no proper matter to which the form-making power could give shape and movement in such a highly differen- tiated animal: For there must needs be that which generates and that from which it generates; even if these be one, still they must be distinct inform and their essence must be different; and in those animals that have these powers separate in two sexes the body and nature of the active and the passive sex must also differ. If, then, the male stands for the effective and active, and the female, considered as female, for the passive, it follows that what the female would contribute to the semen of the male would not be semen but material for the semen to work upon. This is just what we find to be the case, for the catamenia have in their nature an affinity to the primitive matter. (De Gen. I.xx.729a25-35, italics added; see also Phys I.ix.20-24) Because of the way he interprets his general principle that Nature makes nothing in excess, which he repeats in many works, Aristotle argues that it is unreasonable to believe that there is any overlap in reproductive function- that men and women could share the form-making role. Therefore, since it is evident that women's bodies undergo change in the reproductive process, and that fetal development depends upon taking nourishment from the mother's body, Aristotle concludes that women must play the reproductive role of form-receiving matter for men's form-making role and must not contribute to the form-making process in any way. Aristotle's answer to the question, why are there women? is framed in terms of principles of natural necessity rather than in terms of empirical generaliza- tions: "The distinction of sex is first principle" (De Gen. 716b10). His answer derives its language of natural necessity as well as its sharp division of dualistic properties into distinct, separately embodied bundles of principles from the theoretical framework developed in his earlier logical and scientific writings. 81</page><page sequence="13">Hypatia What is new in his biological writings is the ascription of differences in value to these correlative embodiments of his dualistic principle-bundles. As the first efficient or moving cause, to which belong the definition and the form, is better and more divine in its nature than the material on which it works, it is better that the superior principle should be separated from the inferior. Therefore, wherever it is possible, and so far as it is possible, the male is separated from the female. (De Gen. 732a6) This ascribed difference in relative value of complementary embodiments of the dualistic principle-bundles becomes the basis for Aristotle's value hierarchy of kinds of gender-linked friendships in the Nicomachean Ethics and gender-dif- ferentiated achievers of virtue in the Politics. Thus these biological writings reveal the basis of Aristotle's gendered hierarchical superiority of those he regards as both able and entitled to rule as well as to experience what he regards as the best aspects of human life. The differing social roles within the polis of men and women, masters and slaves, and parents and children reflect the systematic operation of the correl- ative dualistic principle-bundles of Nature in the bioreproductive realm that generates this multiplicity of types of human beings. Aristotle's "usual methods" as applied to generative biology show us that men play the upward role in reproduction associated with the first bundle of principles (hot, active, form-making, dominant); this, he says, is what we mean when we call men "male" (De Gen. I.xx.729a5-35). Similarly, his methods show us that women play the reproductive role associated with the second grouping of principles (cold, passive, form-receiving, submissive); this, he says, is what we mean when we call women "female" (De Gen. I.xxi.729b13-15). Though there seems to be no place in his extant works in which Aristotle explicitly names the opposite dualistic principle-bundles "the masculine principles" and "the feminine principles," these passages in De Generatione Animalium, read against the background of the earlier works, suggest that ascription of gender to the principle-bundles themselves is what he has in mind. If one takes this ascription of gender to his principle-bundles seriously, a whole new order within Aristotle's scientific and political vision is revealed. It suggests that Aristotle, like some of his radical feminist critics, regards the masculine/feminine dichotomy as the fundamental characteristic of all dual- isms. It also suggests that in Aristotle's view, participation in the feminine principles is the fundamental cause of all down-ness and that the natural down-ness he attributes to beings other than women derives from their partial participation in the feminine principles. According to Aristotle, the differing characteristics of men and women within their collectively shared human species nature both derive from and allow their differing roles in human reproduction. Since men are reproduc- 82</page><page sequence="14">Judith M. Green tively form-making, it is not surprising that their nature is like that of the form for the species as a whole. Complementarily, since women are form-receiving, it is not surprising that their nature deviates from that of the species as a whole in exactly those ways that are important for the reproduction of the species (741a6ff). Because of the relative coldness of women-a characteristic that he believed to be empirically proven as well as theoretically necessary (728b 18)- women cannot play the form-making role in reproduction but are able to play the form-receiving role, which too much heat would prevent. In contrast, men's naturally greater vital heat (to kaloumenon thermon) allows them to play the form-making role in reproduction. Though Aristotle generally discusses the issue of sex and relative hotness and coldness in terms of simple heat, using the same word (to thermon) that he used in discussing the fire-derived relative hotness and coldness of various substances in the Physics, there is one passage in De Generatione Animalium where he introduces the modifier kaloumenon in differentiating the heat of the male contribution to reproduction from fire- derived heat: Now it is true that the faculty of all kinds of soul seems to have a connection with a matter different from and more divine than the so-called elements; but as one soul differs from another in honor and dishonor, so differs also the nature of the correspond- ing matter. All have in their semen that which causes it to be productive; I mean what is called vital heat. This is not fire nor any such force, but it is the spiritus included in the semen and the foam-like, and the natural principle in the spiritus, being analogous to the element of the stars. Hence, whereas fire generates no animal and we do not find any living thing forming in either solids or liquids under the influence of fire, the heat of the sun and that of animals does generate them. Not only is this true of the heat that works through the semen, but what- ever other residuum of the animal nature there may be, this also has still a vital principle in it. From such considerations it is clear that the heat in animals neither is fire nor derives its origin from fire. (De Gen. 736b30-737a5; italics added) It is not entirely clear whether Aristotle means to reserve this special sense of "heat" for semen or to extend it to body heat of all kinds, including that of both male and female animals. If the former, this seems to be an example of the kind of equivocation he warned against in the Topics, since this vital heat is so different from fire-derived heat as to make the whole analysis (depending as it does upon observable differences in body temperature) fall apart. If the latter, it is still an empirical claim about body temperature that is testable and refutable. If there is no way to gather empirical evidence of differences in this to kaloumenon thermon and to show that men have more of it than women, 83</page><page sequence="15">Hypatia then the weight of the social distinctions Aristotle rests upon these supposedly empirical differences shifts entirely to the preempirical gendered principle- bundles and the principle of necessary verticality. According to Aristotle, it is because of their reproductively necessary coldness that women's capacity for deliberative reason, an aspect of nous (the immaterial mental substance that makes humans able to choose and thus, to transcend Nature to some limited extent), tends not to achieve a high degree of operation. In Politics I.xiii, Aristotle argues that excellence in women is different from excellence in men because women's deliberative reason never achieves full activation. Thus the difference or deficiency in women's embod- iment of the human form that he argues must follow from their reproductive function is associated both with less body heat and with slower nous. Complementarily, it is men's greater amount of body heat that allows them to develop their deliberative reason to a high degree. Since deliberative reason is the proper basis of governance (the upward power to direct the whole), whether in the household or in the polis, and normal men have it to a higher degree than normal woman (and natural masters to a higher degree than natural slaves), normal men are naturally better fitted for goverance than normal woman and all natural slaves. Again, Nature makes nothing in excess. Therefore, both the household and the polis must actually need the directive power of normal men's fully developed deliberative reason to function well. Aristotle's claims about the political implications of sex-differentiated human reproduction depend upon his claim of unequal human participation in the form of the species. Humans taken as a whole are, according to Aristotle, a form-making species relative to other animals, properly dominating them, making them human prey, and using them as matter for human purposes (Pol. I). However, the characteristic tendencies of the human species as determined by its form and embodying substance are not manifested equally in all its members. Rather, these species tendencies reflect the naturally "upward" dominant members' formal characteristics and substance; other members of the polis represent a downward hierarchy of deficiencies relative to one or more aspects of the human form. According to Aristotle, human beings differ in their form-making tendency on the basis of the extent of their natural endowment and degree of develop- ment of nous or deliberative reason, the form-making substance within the human compound nature. Only those normal, naturally masterful adult men who are full embodiments of the masculine principles as they operate within the human species have a large enough endowment of nous and a high enough body heat to activate it into full-speed motion, just as they concoct their blood into semen (De Gen. 726b21 and 726b30-32). Thus only these who are fully "masculine" relative to the rest of the household have the natural capacity to rule or direct the household compound as a whole in developing toward its telos. Members of another group of humans are bor with substantial endow- 84</page><page sequence="16">Judith M. Green ments of nous, but their body temperature is not quite warm enough to heat it to the level of its highest capability of movement. These are normal women, capable of giving direction to their own lives and those of others within certain narrow limits but not capable of making the more complex and abstract decisions of household and polis life that call for excellent development of practical wisdom (phronesis) or of achieving any of the other forms of intellec- tual excellence (arete) that Aristotle discusses at length in Nicomachean Ethics VI. Children with normal endowments of nous for their sex can be expected over time to develop normal adult capacities to employ deliberative reason. While they are small children with undeveloped nous, however, they are naturally subordinate beings; for the present, both their fathers and their mothers, and perhaps even their enslaved teachers, are their natural leaders. Thus, normal males with a masculine endowment of nous that has reached an adult stage of development are the natural leaders within their nuclear families because their capacity to employ this form-defining substance makes them the embodiments of the masculine principles within the family com- pound. As ordered by the principle of necessary verticality according to the relative locational tendencies of their substances, the proper places of the other members of the nuclear family are downward or feminine as long as these relative tendencies within their component substances persist. This pattern of dynamic relations of dominance and subordination among normally nous- endowed family members seems to be what Aristotle has in mind in comparing the various family dyadic relations to forms of political rule. In Politics I.xii, he argues that the natural relations of dominance and subordination within a household are quasi-monarchical between father and children and statesman- like between husband and wife, each differing from the civic form of rule after which it is modeled in the duration of its term. While the head of the household rules over both wife and children, and rules over both as free members of the household, he exercises a different sort of rule in either case. His rule over his wife is like that of a statesman over fellow citizens; his rule over his children is like that of a monarch over subjects. The male is naturally fitter to command than the female, except where there is some departure from nature; and age and matu- rity are similarly fitter to command than youth and immatu- rity.... The relation of the male to the female is permanently that in which the statesman [temporarily] stands to his fellow citizens. For most women and for most female children, this subordinate relation to normal male husbands and fathers will persist throughout their lives. For normal male children, this relation will change over time until they become approximate equals of their fathers as their character and their nous develop. 85</page><page sequence="17">Hypatia Aristotle acknowledges rare exceptions to this pattern, but regards them as a "departure from Nature"-women may play the upward or masculine role within the family, and men may play the downward or feminine role, but this indicates that there must be some relative excess in the female and some relative deficiency in the male. In Aristotle's view, sex alone does not determine relative proper place within the household. Rather, proper place is determined by a combination of sex (with its accompanying body heat), stage of development, and extent of natural endowment of nous. Some humans are born with only enough nous to realize its importance and to be able to act under the direction of those with a greater endowment. These people are naturally slaves, Aristotle says, able to achieve their own development and happiness only under the direction of others. Though their embodiment of the form is defective, as is that of all women, both male and female slaves exist in Nature because they are useful, completing the household of the normally nous-endowed family by contribut- ing additional bodily capacities that can be put to good use in producing the material stuff that is essential to the maintenance, reproduction, and elevation of the household toward its natural collective telos (Pol. I). Thus Aristotelian natural slavery is based on mental deficiency, not on difference in race, as Elizabeth V. Spelman (1988) has suggested. To help us understand Aristotle's vision of these correlative proper places among all the intersecting groups within the household and the polis, the metaphor of a thermometer on which proper places are ordered in terms of "relative degrees of nous" seems useful.11 Perhaps an Aristotelian nous ther- mometer would look like this: 9 - Masculine men with an supra-normal degree of endowment and development of nous 8 - Masculine men with a normal-for-males degree of endowment and development of nous 7 - Extraordinary ("masculine") women with a supra-normal degree of endowment and development of nous 6 - Masculine men with a normal-for-males endowment of nous that is inadequately developed due to lack of leisure (e.g., farmers and artisans) 5 - Feminine women with a normal-for-females endowment and develop- ment of nous that is sufficient for a limited scope of both autonomy and domestic leadership 4 - Feminine men with a normal-for-males endowment of nous that is deficient in decisiveness due to incontinence of character 86</page><page sequence="18">Judith M. Green 3 - Children of both sexes with a normal endowment of nous that needs development under the direction of normal adults FREEZING POINT 2 - Men with inadequate endowment of nous for even limited autonomy, i.e., male natural slaves 1 - Women with inadequate endowment of nous for even limited auton- omy, i.e., female natural slaves 0 - Animals of other species Thus men with a normal-for-men endowment and a mature development of nous would be placed upward from women with a normal-for-women endowment and mature development of nous. Both would be placed upward from small children of both sexes with normal endowments of nous. A line running across the lower part of the nous thermometer would represent a kind of "freezing point" that distinguishes those who have adequate nous and body heat for the amount of autonomy usual to their sex from those who lack enough nous and body heat and thus, must be directed by others. Though Aristotle seems to be silent on the matter of the natural ordering of relationships among male and female slaves, this thermometer metaphor suggests that he would expect them to follow his general principles of Nature, with male slaves dominant over female slaves within areas of shared activity except in the case of an aberration in character or natural mental ability, as seems likely to have been the norm in ancient Greece. According to this interpretation, as with Elizabeth V. Spelman's, sex and gender are not the same (Spelman 1988). However, unlike Spelman's inter- pretation, which treats Aristotelian personal gender as fixed and absolute, with "matching" biological sex treated as a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a gender attribution, this analysis treats Aristotelian personal gender as the mutable indicator of proper place relative to others within a frame of reference as determined by relative degrees of usable nous. According to this interpreta- tion, sex operates as a partial personal gender indicator (because sex differen- tiation is directly related to capacity to heat both blood and nous, allowing one sex to be reproductively a form-maker and the other to be a form-receiver), but sex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient indicator of relative personal gender. According to Aristotle, we cannot determine with certainty that a woman of privilege is naturally subordinate to her husband because there are exceptions to the general pattern of Nature (Pol. I.xii. 1259b). Likewise, we cannot determine with certainty from their bodies which people are natural masters and which are natural slaves, though there are generally associated bodily tendencies. 87</page><page sequence="19">Hypatia [We have hitherto been speaking of mental differences.] But it is nature's intention also to erect a physical difference between the body of the freeman and that of the slave, giving the latter strength for the menial duties of life but making the former upright in carriage and (though useless for physical labor)useful for the various purposes of civic life.... The contrary of nature's intention, however, often happens: there are some slaves who have the bodies of freemen-as there are others who have a freeman's soul. But if nature's intention were realized ... it is obvious that we should all agree that the inferior class ought to be the slaves of the superior. And if this principle is true when the difference is one of the body, it may be affirmed with still greater justice when the difference is one of the soul.... (Pol. I.v. 1254b) These passages suggest that body types-even sex types-are not a sufficient basis for picking out the natural leaders within a particular political compound, relative to whom all other member elements are naturally subordinate. If Aristotelian gender is understood as fundamentally a feature of the naturally vertical relational ordering of dualistic "masculine" and "feminine" principles of the cosmos rather than as based at rock bottom on biological sex, one's gendered proper place in the polis is ultimately determined by neither one's sex nor one's level of privilege, but by the prior principles that determine both sex and natural level of privilege. Thus a mature and mentally gifted female can be masculine in proper place (i.e., naturally dominant) relative to males who are mentally deficient in natural endowment, in character, or in maturity. Such males would be feminine in proper place relative to her. Their relative proper places would be determined not by their sexes but by their mental capacities, which are generally but not always indicated by sex. Spelman's interpretation suggests that slaves lack gender within Aristotle's analysis and are subordinated on the basis of race. The result of her analysis is a fourfold typology of human beings within the polis with no overall principle of correlation. However, Spelman herself offers grammatical evidence of Aristotle's attribution of gender to slaves: when he refers to slaves as tools, he refers to them in the neuter (doulon); but when he refers to them as human, they have gender, doulos signifying a male slave and doule signifying a female slave (Spelman 1988). Moreover, race is a modern category that had no place in the Greek conceptual framework of Aristotle's era. Finally, if we interpret Aristotelian personal gender as fundamentally a function of relative degree of usable nous, emphasizing mental differences as the basis of personal gender and personal gender as the basis of natural relations of dominance and subordina- tion, we can interconnect all of the human political types in terms of a principle of necessary verticality operating on the masculine and feminine principle- 88</page><page sequence="20">Judith M. Green bundles. These results are consistent with Aristotle's overall analysis because even though the principle of necessary verticality operates uniformly in ordering the masculine and feminine principle-bundles, humans are composed of two different substances, nous and the bodily stuff that must be shaped for reproduction. Two principle-bundles variously expressible in terms of two substances gives us the possibility of four human types; add in the differences caused by the cycle of development and decline as well as those due to the possibility of choice in the creating of adult characters, and the full range of types and associated proper places in the polis indicated on the nous thermom- eter has been accounted for. IV. Feminist Critique According to Aristotle's own method, full understanding requires knowing not only what is the case but also why it is the case. This "full understanding" of his remarks in the Politics about gendered proper places in the polis would require more than knowing that Aristotle believed the principle of necessary verticality to be a universal principle of Nature that included the human community. It would also require knowing more than that he believed hierar- chically ordered proper places in the polis derive from modifications in substance that serve the purposes of production and reproduction in achieving the ultimate telos of the collective human form. It would require knowing why Aristotle believed relative up-ness and down-ness of proper place to be a fundamental and necessary principle of Nature. The importance of answering this question within a complete feminist analysis of Aristotle's theoretical vision cannot be overstated. Its answer is a key to understanding many problems of central theoretical concern to feminist critics of Western culture: the roots of historical and contemporary problems about hierarchy in all forms, the basis of the traditional bifurcation of natural and social worlds into "male" and "female" domains and gender roles, the origin of myriad forms of oppression, and the earliest rationale for traditional exploitative use of other species by humans. This would be Mary Daly's "getting around the baffle gates of the godfathers into the Background" in ways that have enormous importance for our present and future (Daly 1978). Feminist intellectual archaeology to date has suggested at least three kinds of theories (and associated critiques) about why Aristotle and the sources on which he relied believed that there are naturally upward and downward, masculine and feminine dualistic oppositions in all of Nature. Some feminist theorists have proposed a revisionist psychoanalytic explanation.12 However, the essentialist methodology on which this approach rests seems at least as much in need of feminist critique as do the ancient Greek visions it is used to diagnose. Other feminist theorists have attempted to explain and to criticize Aristotle's gendered dualisms in terms of traditional features of Greek political 89</page><page sequence="21">Hypatia economy.13 However, it is important to note both how old these gendered patterns are in Western culture and how persistently they have been preserved through the development of a variety of subsequent modifications in forms of political economy. This suggests that there must be some additional back- ground factor in the origin of this vision that has continued to have power in Western civilization until the present time. While this may not be a matter that can ever be decisively resolved, there are many passages, both in the Politics and in Aristotle's earlier philosophical and scientific works, that suggest an explanation of this shadowy "other factor": the shaping influence of the Greek land's challenging climate, direct light, and vertical landscape upon the emerging Hellenic culture during its earliest stages of technological develop- ment, an experience of human subordination to Nature's power and beauty that is expressed in Greek civilization's oldest texts and that even a first-time visitor can share in part.14 Unfortunately, it is beyond the scope of this essay to do more than to try to reveal the workings of Aristotle's baffle gates and to squint into the Background without going further. Thus, a full Aristotelian understanding of this subject must elude us for the present. Nonetheless, we can draw some important conclusions and some interesting lessons from the analysis of Aristotle's vision as we have come to partially understand it. If the foregoing analysis of the extended line of argument running through the major works of the Aristotelian corpus is persuasive, then Aristotle must be found not guilty of the charge of inconsistency in his account of gendered proper places in the polis. Understood against the background of his earlier works, especially the Physics and De Generatione Animalium, his analysis in the Politics seems consistent and coherent rather than fragmentary and arbitrary. His claims about the relative proper places within the household of free adult males, free adult females, slaves of both sexes, and children of both sexes can be seen to grow out of principles or Nature explored in the earlier works, though Aristotle also counted the fact that they were generally borne out by what he believed to be universal human custom and opinion as important evidence for their truth. Following from these same general principles, Aristotle's other analyses in the Politics of classlike relationships within the polity, the relative desirability of different forms of governance, the location and design of cities, and human relationships to other species and to the land complete a consistent and coherent prescriptive model of human life. However, the consistency and coherence of Aristotle's overall theory do not make it insightful. Rather, we have good reason to reject it because the argument about gendered proper places in the polis that grows out of it is both logically and pragmatically unsound. Aristotle's argument about gendered proper places is unsound in part because it contains several logically invalid chains of inference. For example, consider the following argument: 90</page><page sequence="22">Judith M. Green 1. There must be both a form-making role and a form-receiving role in reproduction. 2. Hermaphroditic reproduction does not occur in the higher animals. 3. Nature makes nothing in excess. 4. Women's bodies undergo change in pregnancy. 5. Therefore, women must be purely form-receivers. This conclusion does not follow from these premises unless they are given a special interpretation in this context, for example, unless "Nature makes nothing in excess" is interpreted to mean "Nothing in Nature has any area of overlapping actual capacity with anything else in Nature." However, this interpretation would violate Aristotle's own observation that we sometimes see things used for purposes other than their best use. Moreover, he himself noted in his discussion of the physical characteristics of natural masters and natural slaves that the shape of the body is at best an imperfect guide to a person's nature and social role, so he cannot properly use the fact that women's bodies change shape during pregnancy as the basis of his claim that all women are solely form-receivers. Thus Aristotle is entitled to conclude at most that women are needed for human reproduction and must be form-receivers in part. Similarly, Aristotle is not entitled to conclude that women's allegedly lower body temperature does not allow women to activate their nous fully since it does not allow them to concoct their blood into semen. Apart from the absence of empirical evidence for the comparative claim about body heat, and from the fact that we now know that blood cannot be concocted into semen, blood is a material substance to which body heat might be thought to be relevant, but nous is immaterial. Thus, Aristotle's claims about relative body heat would seem to be irrelevant to his claims about relative mental capacity. Problems in soundness also derive from insufficiently supported background assumptions that do not seem as obviously correct to the modem reader as they may have seemed to Aristotle's contemporaries. For example, the claim that correlative relationships within Nature are organized by a principle of neces- sary verticality operating on dualistic principle-bundles is founded on Aristotle's insufficiently supported belief in the necessity and usefulness of hierarchical relationships. The basis for this first principle is nothing more than universal (Greek) agreement, including the opinions of the "wise men" of his cultural tradition, which made it seem "obvious" to Aristotle. Furthermore, Aristotle's key implicit claim that his first principles of Nature generally operate in the same way in the human domain, in spite of the capacity for choice that he attributes to us, is insufficiently supported and probably impor- tantly wrong. 91</page><page sequence="23">Hypatia Finally, we have a further reason to regard Aristotle's argument about proper places in the polis as unsound on the basis of a feminist pragmatic epistemo- logical criterion that requires theory to reflect women's experience (and not just privileged men's) and to offer good guidance in solving emergent social problems to women's satisfaction (and not just privileged men's). Aristotle himself accepted a quasi-pragmatic "positive fit" criterion in his methodolog- ical requirement that his generalizations accord well with human custom and experience. However, we have reason to reject Aristotle's generalizations about women's proper place, even within his own historical and cultural context, because they must have been experienced as oppressive by at least some women in his own time, for example, by Sappho and her friends. Moreover, they have helped to rationalize an on-going pattern of social relations that is experienced as oppressive from the historically emerging standpoint of woman.15 In our own time, so many "anomalies" that do not fit his generalizations have arisen in the form of women of civic and scholarly excellence that presumably these would give even Aristotle cause for doubting his conclusions about the subordinate place in the polis that is proper to women. Likewise, slavery has been repudiated as a political institution in our era because the weight of historical evidence finally cast doubt on the principle of mutually beneficial natural hierarchy on which it was based. Thus, the limited experiential basis and the pragmatic harmfulness of Aristotle's prescriptions about gendered proper places in the polis show that the argument that led to them must be unsound. V. Conclusion This combination of a consistent and coherent overall theory with unsound arguments and unreliable conclusions shows that the problems in his theory go beyond Aristotle's treatment of gendered proper places in the polis. The more fundamental problem is his unreliable theoretical method-including his tradition-based first principles-by which Aristotle arrived at these con- clusions. This result is both threatening and useful. It shows that even a brilliant mind like Aristotle's failed to achieve intellectual autonomy from the presupposi- tions of his culture, including some of those that are both groundless and harmful. It also shows that theoretical consistency and coherence are insuffi- cient warrants of the truth or even the harmlessness of a theoretical vision. At the same time, this analysis has two kinds of outcomes that may be useful for future feminist theorizing: a clearer picture of the gendered structure of Aristotle's entire philosophical vision, which is still so influential in the substructure of the Western world, and a contrasting background for articulat- ing methodological caveats that will help us to avoid Aristotle's mistakes. Some of these caveats have been articulated within previous feminist critiques 92</page><page sequence="24">Judith M. Green of Aristotle's texts and of related works. These include the need for wariness of the influence of a Canon, of cultural tradition, and of popular opinion. This analysis suggests other caveats that need to be more fully discussed; for example, the need for wariness of hierarchical and dualistic thinking, of prescription too closely linked to description, of a positive fit criterion unbal- anced by consideration of alternative explanations, and of the fallacy of composition.16 Above all, this analysis suggests the importance of wariness in how we pose our questions. It is interesting to speculate about how different Aristotle's biological and social theories might have been if he had started from the question, why are there men? instead of the question, why are there women?

The Greek expression traditionally translated as "Nature" is he Physis (note capitalization), which is the realm of all those things that move and change according to the particular principle of movement and change (physis) of things of their kind, i.e., their nature. Within this essay, as is customary, he Physis will be translated as "Nature," and physis will be translated as "nature." 3. Lynda Lange quotes a passage from Aristotle's Eudemian Ethics that emphasizes the uniformity of methods in all his works, and thus refers the reader back to the philosophic and scientific works for fuller information about political science: "We should not think even in political philosophy that the sort of consideration which not only makes the nature of the thing evident but also its cause is superfluous, for such consideration is in every enquiry the truly philosophic method" (EE 1.6; Lange 1983). 4. In their introduction to the Loeb edition of the Physics, Wickstead and Comford emphasize this traditional understanding of Aristotle's works of Nature, including those that deal with humans, as interconnected parts of a whole: "The Physics only covers the principia or fundamental and elementary problems of Natural Philosophy. It was actually known to Dante and the Schoolmen as the 'First Book' on Nature, and in Avicenna's paraphrase of Aristotle's works the Psychology was enumerated as the 'Sixth Book' of the 'Things of Nature.' "Passages from Aristotle's Physics quoted in this essay are taken from Wickstead and Comford's translation (Aristotle 1929, 1934). 5. As Edward Hussey (1972) points out, this habit of Aristotle's often makes him the best extant source on the beliefs of these earlier thinkers. Aristotle's method of using the views of earlier thinkers as his starting point is demonstrated in Politics I.ii, in which he refers to the views of Hesiod, Charondas, Epimenides the Cretan, and Homer concerning the basic forms of relationship within the household before going on to develop his own view. Similarly, in Nicomachean Ethics I.viii, Aristotle says about views associating happiness with wisdom that have been held by many men and men of old, or by a few eminent persons, that "it is not probable that either of these should be entirely mistaken, but rather that they should be right in at least some one respect or even in most 93</page><page sequence="25">Hypatia respects." Passages from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics quoted in this essay are taken from the W. D. Ross translation (Aristotle 1941). 6. In the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle argues that all demonstration depends upon starting from obvious first principles: "All teaching and all intellectual learning come about from already existing knowledge" (Post. An. I.i.7 al-2). Moreover, "It is necessary for demonstrative understanding in particular to depend on things which are true and primitive and immediate and more familiar than and prior to and explanatory of the conclusion (for in this way the principles will also be appropriate to what is being proved)" (Post. An. I.ii.71b20-23). Passages from Aristotle's Posterior Analytics quoted in this essay are taken from Jonathan Bares's translation (Aristotle 1975). 7. This positive empirical fit criterion can be seen at work in both the Politics and De Generatione Animalium, e.g., "This a priori argument is confirmed by the facts" (De Gen. I.xxi.729b21). 8. Wickstead and Corford describe Aristotle's method in the Physics as beginning by consulting relevant opinion, then moving from the observed phenomena to intellec- tually satisfying theoretical generalizations through inference and intuitive insight (Aris- totle 1929, 1934). 9. All quotations from the Politics found within this essay are from Ernest Barker's translation (Aristotle 1946). 10. This same modem emphasis slants the analysis of correlative relationships within the polls in Terence Irwin's Aristotle's First Principles (1988). 11.
