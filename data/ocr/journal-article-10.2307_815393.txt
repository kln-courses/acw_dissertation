<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mutterings Charles Weingartner Nothing of Value Some years ago, Robert Ruark published a book titled Something of Value. It was about the crisis in Africa that resulted, in his view, from the white man's displacement of traditional values among Africans and the failure to replace the displaced values with new ones that might enhance the possibility of psychic as well as physical survival among African blacks. What we need now, in the late '70s, is a similar book about the displacement of values in Western culture generally, and in the U. S. in particular. In a way, there have been a series of books, as well as other briefer comments, about shifts in values in Western culture for some time. The titles, however, have all carried benign connotations, perhaps reflecting the convention of dispassionate, intellectual objectivity on the part of historians. They include books such as the Age of Reason and the Age of Anxiety. One recent one (1977) has complemented this general pattern. It is Kenneth Galbraith's Age of Uncertainty. Preceding Galbraith, in the '60s, were two others that carried somewhat more urgent titles: Toffler's Future Shock, and Druckers' Age of Discontinuity. What is now needed is an explication of the consequences of an accelerating process of redefinition-of everything, but especially of values and their manifestation, institutions. At the very least, we need a book titled The Age of Redefinition and Its Catastrophic Consequences. The basic point underlying this explication would be one that is curiously obscured in the escalated rhetoric about "rights." It is that the quickest way to devalue anything is to make it accessible to anyone "on demand." Thoreau's apergu put it this way: "What is too easily achieved is too lightly esteemed." There are endless examples of the accuracy and truth of this observation in every form of human activity. One is found in the story about a British prep school which was the scene of an annual event involving the theft of a pair of the headmaster's drawers for the purpose of running them up a flagpole atop the highest steeple overlooking the school's courtyard. The boy, the first boy, the only boy to be first, to do this was the school's "unofficial" hero for the year. Now, apart from the nominal and required distress at the prospect of having his drawers on public display, the headmaster suffered real distress at the prospect of a boy falling from the steeple while engaged in this "heroic" act and seriously injuring and possibly even killing himself. It was an extremely dangerous task to get to the flagpole atop the steeple. The ingenuity and skill required in acquiring a pair of the headmaster's drawers was minor compared to the physical danger involved in accomplishing the public display. The headmaster's concern for the physical safety of the boys was his focus, not his "embarrassment" at having his drawers seen by all. His problem was to somehow stop this annual event. If he had been an ordinary school administrator he would have resorted to the usual kind of "deterrent," the imposition of "strict penalties" on whomever made the attempt to accomplish this feat. That is, if he had merely resorted to conventional measures, he would have increased the value of the feat and so would have intensified the efforts of more boys to accomplish it. He was a rare man, however, and understood both the need to devalue the event as well as the manner in which to do it-a la Thoreau. Instead of adding to the value of the event by threatening new penalties and punishments, he simply put up a ladder making access to the steeple easy for anyone who was inclined, for whatever reason, to get to the flagpole. At the point where any ninny in the school could easily get to the flagpole and run up a pair of drawers, the process lost its value: It became meaningless. Human beings do have certain physical, intellectual, and emotional processes in common. One of them is to place value on anything in direct relationship to the relative ease or difficulty of access. What is most difficult to achieve-and so is Charles Weingartner is a Roving Editor for EJ. He teaches at the University of South Flori- da. He mailed in this manuscript from Arizona while en route to British Columbia. 14 English Journal</page><page sequence="2">rare in relation to whatever else-is most highly esteemed. Value is a function or rarity, distinction, uniqueness. That is why diamonds are worth more than coal, and why gold is worth more than lead. Just as the value of anything can be diminished by making it easy of access, the value of anything can be enhanced by making it difficult of access. When breathable air and potable water are abundant, no one thinks about them. When, for whatever reason, they become "rare," through drought or pollution, we face a crisis, and their value is enhanced. As a result of a decade or more, in the U. S., of a simultaneously noble and mindless surge of rhetoric (formalized by legal decisions) aimed at achieving "equality," we have succeeded in devaluing the "glue" that holds a society, or any human group for that matter, together. In order for a human group to survive, two things are necessary: 1) it must have shared values, and 2) these values must enhance rather than jeopardize survival prospects. One such crucial value is related to a knowledge and understanding of limits. This is the knowledge and understanding that includes, among other things, an awareness of, and an ability to act on, the fact that a desirable value can be turned into a meretricious one by "merely" acting on it beyond a certain point. For example, the Old Testament value that we should "go forth and multiply" was feasible when the survival of the group depended upon proliferation to balance the incursions made on the population by a hostile natural environment. But, when the size of the population exceeds the resources needed to support it, that value becomes in itself the most palpable threat to the survival of the group. Schools, one of the most ubiquitous institutions in our society, serve as a kind of microcosm of what is happening in the culture. They do so because they most accurately reflect the values of a culture, and do so more visibly than most other institutions. The formal move toward "equality" was legislated and legalized in schools more visibly, (perhaps because of the magnitude of the scale of the number of people affected), and more dramatically than in any other institution in our society. "Equality" was and is one of the most universally subscribed to values in American society-(more in the abstract than in the particular) prior to the legislation of the '50s and '60s. Who could be against "equality"? It is downright "un-American." "Equality," however, turns out to be, no matter how noble-sounding, a value that denies everything in nature. See Kurt Vonnegut's short story "Harrison Bergeron" for an example of a "literary" treatment of this point. In every form of natural process- survival process-there is not only not "equality," but rather a rigorous and ruthless hierarchy. The "best" (defined in survival terms) survive and the others do not. In nature the hierarchy is determined by strength, speed, ingenuity, adaptability, and chance. There is "authority" in the process that ascribes leadership to the best, however the best is defined in any given species in any given set of circumstances. It is almost commonplace to note that one part of the price we pay in the Faustian bargain with technology is our increasing "illiteracy" in relation to natural processes. Technology increasingly "insulates" us from natural processes and so diminishes not only our familiarity with them, but, more importantly, our understanding of the complex, three-dimensional matrix of transactions that comprise them and that have become over-simplified in the popular use of the word "ecology." Everything affects everything else. The natural environment is not simply a linear series of simple cause and effect events, it is a complex of intricate symbiotic relationships of multiple consequences of frequently indeterminable "causes." Technology has insulated most of us not only from personal experience with natural processes, it has permeated our language with mechanistic metaphors and dangerously simple "cause and effect" ways of thinking about whatever it is that affects us. Curiously, it also produces, as a result, a tendency to seek out a "cause" to blame for whatever "effects" we find uncongenial. That is to say, we combine mechanistic metaphors with primitive patterns of thought permeated with specious analogies compounded by anthropomorphic and ethnocentric overlays. There has probably never been a technology more potent in producing the circumstances cited above than television. It serves as a kind of catalyst for and amplifier of a series of tendencies toward meretricious kinds of perception and cognition characteristic (as nearly as we can tell from history) of human beings. The unnerving aptness of Mary Shelley's metaphor for all of this embodied in her story of Dr. Frankenstein is illustrated continuously in accounts of the "progress" we have been and are making. Since it became a mass medium in the U. S. in the early 1950s, television has served primarily to "broadcast" grossly over-simplified views not only of how the world "is," but how it "ought" to be. TV is the theater for the "morality" plays of our time. When that bemusing fact is combined with the fact that it is also the primary (by sheer volume) source of "information," "values," "entertainment," and "diversion" for our whole society, we have the meaning of Pandora's box intensified to the tenth power. All television is "educational." For better or for worse (and even a quick look around, much less a slow and thoughtful one, makes it clear which) the most potent "educational" force in our society is television. American children spend upwards of seven thousand hours in front of a television set before they start school. By the time they finish the May 1979 15</page><page sequence="3">twelfth grade, they have spent more time in front of a TV set than they have in all of the classes in all of the "subjects" that comprised their twelve years of schooling. As of 1977, the average time spent by Americans in front of a TV set every day was 6'/2 hours. For children, TV is the third parent. Most American children spend more time in front of a television set than they do with their parents. And all of the while they are sitting in front of the TV set, they are learning. What are they learning? What are all Americans learning? The list is long and depressing for anyone who thinks about what they might be learning, and what they should be learning in their own personal interests to say nothing of our national interests. The children learn, for example, that: -every problem has a single "cause," usually a "bad guy," but never ourselves, despite what Pogo said. -we have no personal responsibility for anything (since TV is replete with psycho-sociological jive talk that amounts to "the devil made me do it"). -every problem has a simple solution that "they"-scientists, physicians, Pentagon officials, CIA, FBI, or any one of a number of assorted stereotypic "good guys" (that is, who are on "our side"; the "bad guys" are always on the "other side")-will provide. -the only way to think about anything in the universe is in terms of opposites-all or none, good or bad, right or wrong-never in terms of degrees or shades of difference, or even "worse," in terms of the possibility that every "story" might have many more than two sides, none 6f which provides any basis for deciding which is "right or wrong." -simple reassuring answers are "best" because complex, frustrating answers are "negative." The underlying premise being that anything "negative" (i.e., disturbing) is "bad." Since most of the facts about the human condition are "bad" from this perspective, the last thing anyone is liable to see on TV is anything related to reality. -we are the premier "good guys" in the world, and anybody who even intimates otherwise should be locked up, deported, or, at least, punched in the mouth. We are the absolute best, and beyond criticism from anyone anywhere. -platitudes, euphemisms, and lies or half-truths are much to be preferred to epigrams, accurate descriptions, and whole truths. (The latter might possibly upset some potential customers that the TV station is delivering to the advertiser.) -for any physical or emotional problem that anyone has there is a pill, or a lotion, or a spray that will give "instant relief" which is now regarded as being even better than a real solution (which might take some effort to work out). --"celebrities" (singers, actors, jocks) are the most noble, most honorable, most venerable "persons" in our entire society because they, too, divert us from reality, and in so doing make important contributions to society. And so on. You can add your own "lessons" to the list. In the face of all of this, what important responsibilities are English teachers charged with? Well, schools in general, and English as a "subject" in particular, have as little tolerance for reality as TV does. Reality is "too controversial." So what are we left with? Well, there's spelling and punctuation, composition, and even "vocabulary words." (Has anyone ever seen a list of non-vocabulary words?) And what is our contribution to society? Well, if we are "successful" and our teaching is "productive," we can bask in the glory that accrues from raising scores on some standardized, multiple choice test, since this "achievement" is now the keystone in the value system of the schools. While our contribution to society might not rank as highly as does that of TV "celebrities," we at least have the consolation of knowing that we are not well paid for it.
