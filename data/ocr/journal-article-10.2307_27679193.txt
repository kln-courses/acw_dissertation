<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prayer and Life Joseph Stephen O'Leary In this century we are witnessing a great revival of the Christian sense of life. The key-policy of the revival seems to me to be this : to bring the attitudes of prayer into the heart of secular experience. It might seem that there is nothing wonderfully new about this project. Surely it corresponds exactly with the simple, spontaneous reaction a person would have who had read the gospel for the first time. Surely every Christian aspires to live a life of faith, hope and charity - so why talk of the reconciliation of prayer and life as if it were some magnificent, unheard-of feat? Yet we need only consider the long and arid disputes about 'action and contempla tion' carried on by spiritual theorists of the past, to realize how unwholesome a compartmentalization had undermined the unity of Christian living. It seemed that faith, hope and charity flour ished unblemished only under hothouse monastic conditions. The effort to transpose the contemplative attitude to the sphere of worldly acti jn was regarded as a rather esoteric, highly intellectual procedure, demanding a special degree of sanctity. Today Chris tian wisdom has come into the streets. We are no longer afraid to find a divine meaning in the ordinary richness of human experience. Though the resulting spirituality is confusing, and even chaotic, in its richness, it is certainly far more adequate to the needs of the mature Christian than the cramping round of routine devotions which previously served as his 'spiritual nourishment'. If we want to speed up this development of a rich and unified Joseph O'Leary was born in Cork in 1949. Educated at the North Monastery and Maynooth. Degree in Modern Languages 1969.

We must promote the fecund interaction of prayer and life. All our life must be brought into the light of prayer, and the attitudes of faith, hope and charity which the hours spent at prayer form in us must become immediately effective in our ordinary living. We no longer have time for those spiritual detours which delayed the interaction of prayer and life in the past. We will abolish for example, aesthetic discrepancies between the terms of prayer and those of ordinary living e.g. between the romantic Italianate extravagances of the old-fashioned prayer book and the actual feelings of contemporary adults. We will abolish devotions performed merely out of duty, and place much more emphasis on the psychological effectiveness of our prayer than on the invisible merit it gains. Constancy and regularity at prayer are as great virtues as ever, but they subserve the higher purpose of creative growth towards spiritual maturity. In the following pages I intend to study the directions in which this growth occurs and, by an analysis of prayer's effects on life, to clear the path for the intelligent formulation of the principles of modern spirituality. PRAYER AND GROWTH IN FAITH We cannot think of God except by praying to him. The thought of the non-praying person about God falls between two stools. God for him is the name of an absurd anthropomorphic Hebrew inven tion, or else a remote philosophical notion. But when we address a confident 'thou' in prayer to the person they designate, the name and the notion recall a living presence. There are many, even Christians, who shy away from any mention of God with instinc tive discomfort, either with feelings of rationalistic mistrust, or of boredom, or of a slight mystification. In the person who prays, however, the thought of God ignites a spark of loving recognition : it is not a burden to be carried out of duty, or a Sunday morning matter irrelevant to his present concerns, but a reality which faith has made intrinsic to his concrete experience, and which is even more real to him than the visible world itself. To think of God in prayer means to remember the saving actions through which he revealed himself in history and in our lives. These are all centred in Christ, God's unique and unsur passable revelation of himself to us. Without the mediation of</page><page sequence="3">610 THE FURROW Christ our thought of God would flounder hopelessly among philosophical abstractions belonging to a sphere utterly separated from the visible world about us, or else it would become mythical, anthropomorphic or pantheistic. From this a practical conclusion immediately follows: if we want to bring God into our lives we must personally assimilate in our prayer the Church's communal and traditional understanding of Christ. We must meditate with the Church on the concrete historical events of Christ's life, in which the whole Christian mystery is anchored. We must turn over in our minds the words of the Bible and of the Church's prayer, in an attempt to share as deeply as possible the Church's experience of Christ. This type of prayer is more than ordinary reflection; it is reflection directed to the goal of making the realities of faith vividly present in our lives. The liturgical year most clearly illustrates how the remembrance of past events in prayer teaches us to discover the saving reality they signify as an actual presence in our lives. It seems to me that there are two mistakes we must avoid if our life of faith is not to become unbalanced. (a) The first mistake is committed when we substitute our own subjective and spontaneous sentiments for the language of reve lation. If we dismantle the language of scripture and the Church in favour of existential 'meaningfulness' and 'relevance' our prayer cannot take us beyond the limited horizons of our immediate situation, and it has its firm foothold in the objective 'divine milieu' into which prayer in Christ leads us. Our prayer should be a turning to Christ, a conversion, a raising of heart and mind. The tendency to replace the traditional structures of Christian prayer with idealistic reflections on the human condition causes faith to collapse in a bog of catch words and self-congratulatory sentimen tality. In prayer we struggle against the pull of normal preoccupa tions which tend to distract us from the real, invisible dimension revealed to the eyes of faith. We attempt to pin all our thoughts on Christ, to bind ourselves to him, and this always requires an effort of getting beyond ourselves. It involves a dissatisfaction with life as it is, with its obscurity and unreality, and a thirst for the depth and intelligibility which life can attain in the mystery of Christ. It involves tearing ourselves away from an easy attachment to life's muddled paths. Prayer is a quest for God's wisdom and for his judgment on life. Its opposite is a complacent acceptance of life on its own terms. If we really are bent on attaining a Christian vision of life we</page><page sequence="4">PRAYER AND LIFE 611 will gladly embrace the Church's tradition, which indicates lines of expansion for our prayer, clarifying and universalizing the obscure patterns of our personal experience. By linking our own thoughts, feelings and actual problems with formulae like the 'Our Father', the Psalms, St Thomas's eucharistie prayers, we give our prayer a chance of becoming rich and deep in a way it never could if we were left to discover words for ourselves. (b) The second mistake is committed when our prayer is not adequately linked to our ordinary experience. Prayer should teach us to refer all our experience to God and to find his presence everywhere. It should give a sacramental meaning to all we do or perceive, a meaning not imposed extrinsically but springing up spontaneously at the heart of experience. It should lead us to see, for example, in the beauty of a summer's day a reflection of God's glory: not by giving us a capacity for making pious and edifying remarks (that is a symptom of prayer which is inadequately linked to life) but by sensitizing us to the dimension of mystery in our experience. Prayer makes us conscious of God's omnipresence, which is not a spatial, monolithic mass, but a total, personal, Trinitarian presence which may surprise us anywhere, in any pass ing joy or sorrow. It makes us aware of the theocentric meaning of our experience. For example it shows the march of science towards the truth to be rooted in divine truth, or it reveals the experience of conscience as a personal revelation of God. The man who does not pray 'has the experience but misses the meaning'; the man who does pray should not miss the meaning, since he habitually refers his experiences to the deepest ground of their intelligibility. The person who prays should be incapable of falling into any narrow or materialistic or academic ruts of thought. The thought of God should act like a powerful magnetic influence on his thought-structures and on his perceptions, moulding them, gradu ally but surely, to the truth. It brought Augustine from Neo Platonism to Christianity; it guided Newman's historical researches to Rome; it changed Gabriel Marcel from an idealist into a concrete philosopher. Surely, if the attitudes of faith that we express in prayer are real at all, such a transformation of our thought and experience will inevitably follow. When we pray we pass from the sphere of easily-controlled ideas and autonomous decisions into that of personal involvement in a mystery that sur passes all understanding. But there is often a gap between the terms of our prayer and the narrow modes of thinking that govern our attitudes to life.</page><page sequence="5">612 THE FURROW This inconsistency between prayer and life should be overcome by our creative efforts to achieve a unified vision of life. We should approach the scripture of life with the same attention and concen tration that we bring to a prayerful meditation on the Bible. Just as prayer brings the words of the Bible to life, it should also open our eyes and ears with renewed respect to the world of our experience. Lots of interesting things are going on about us - and they are all revelation : this visible world and we ourselves are part of the mystery of Christ. The things we think about in prayer really have a direct application to our lives : this is not an edifying fiction, but an overwhelming fact whose implications we must explore. Creative prayer snatches opportunistically at every passing mood, at every incident, which offers access to the central mystery of our being. Every moment of life becomes an invitation to prayer and all life is shot through with an inexhaustible density of spiritual meaning. Prayer should be a constant and unfailing source of illumination to us. This word 'illumination' may suggest to some an abstract, impersonal light, invading the soul from above, infused into it like some homogeneous liquid. Such bloodless metaphors only dis courage people from prayer (unless they have special mystical aspirations). Our experience of the illumination prayer brings is more realistically described as a series of personal monitions or intimations of the divine guide and counsellor, who meets us surely, though undetectably, through various words, experiences, ideas that enlighten our path through life. When we pray the Holy Spirit tutors our faltering hearts and tongues, helping us to respond intelligently and adequately to the mystery of Christ and leading us 'into all truth'. The daily growth in wisdom that prayer brings could be explained naturally, without the postulation of any supernatural intervention as in the cases of Augustine, Newman and Marcel above. It is true that prayer does not miraculously give us new ideas: it does not change the modes of thought we have received from our education. But by making the thought of God a vivid reality it can help us to overcome the inadequacy of our intellectual machinery and free us from entanglement in error. The process by which prayer brings light to the mind is complex and intract able, partly natural and partly supernatural. In it we recognize the Holy Spirit at work, acting, as always, invisibly and unpredictably through the concrete events and experiences of life. If we are not to frustrate the Spirit through negligence or timidity</page><page sequence="6">PRAYER AND LIFE 613 we must boldly expose every region of our Uves to God's judgment, in prayer. We must confess our lives to God in penitence and praise. St Ignatius sets out very deliberately to see life in the light of God's truth when he prays thus in the Spiritual Exercises : I will reflect on the nature and attributes of God against whom I have sinned, contrasting them with their opposites in me - his wisdom with my ignorance, his infinite power with my impotence, his justice with my wickedness ... God's judgment is 'the beginning of wisdom'. When our under standing is guided by human judgments, which devalue life, we squander time, content with a passive flow of unquestioned experi ence. We give undue weight to narrow ambitions and shallow satisfactions and are inattentive to the deeper meaning of our life. But when we hold up our life to God's judgment we realize for the first time how far it falls short of its full potential. The word of God has more than the regulative influence of an abstract philoso phical or ethical idea : it is 'living and active' (Heb. 4:12) : it judges life. In prayer we should make a conscious attempt to subject all our thoughts and deeds to its judgment. Our prayer should become God's sustained critique of our life. Familiarity with Christ exposes all the superficiality in our thoughts and attitudes and draws out their deepest theocentric meaning. It demands that life be revalued and recast. If in prayer we search 'the depths of God' (1 Cor. 2:10) we cannot in consis tency continue to live by depthless codes and criteria and to indulge egoistic and worldly habits of thinking and acting. But habit is blinding in these matters and instant self-knowledge is an impossibility. We must co-operate intelligently and patiently with the Holy Spirit in learning to apply the sense of living values and of priorities that prayer gives us, to every region of our existence. In this way one prayer will teach us to 'judge all things' (1 Cor. 2:25). This judgment is not the depreciating stare which destroys all beauty and worth. When the Psalmist speaks of God's watchful eye upon him he does not express a sense of being enslaved by the Sartrean Took' of a cruel task-master. He rejoices in being known by God, whose just but forgiving judgment covers a multitude of sins : O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me Thou knowest when I sit down and when I rise up; Thou discernest my thoughts from afar. The same blend of piercing lucidity and healing sympathy should inform our judgment of ourselves, of others and of the world.</page><page sequence="7">614 THE FURROW Prayer may teach us to cry 'vanity of vanities' or 'all flesh is grass' or 'Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man', but if it leads us to be superior or puritanical in our judgments we cannot have succeeded in bringing our whole life into the light of God's truth, for this reveals first of all the uniqueness and mystery of people : against that background we can feel only compassion for their spiritual needs and limitations. Prayer should not take us into an unreal world of poetic images, the sort of world created by nineteenth-century ecclesiastical decorators. The world of faith must become immense enough and real enough to us in prayer for all our ordinary thoughts and actions to be embraced by it. Any division between religion and life is the mark of an unwholesome inconsistency. The mysteries of religion should interpenetrate bewilderingly with the mysteries of life. All our experiences should be infolded into the mystery of Christ and this should be unfolded to us in our experiences. This two-way process of illumination demands no great intellectual powers on the part of him who prays (though these can of course be helpful). If he 'hears the word of God and keeps it', consistently referring his thoughts to it, he will grow in a simple and powerful wisdom. He will learn 'the language of the cross' (1 Cor. 1:18) which deci phers all the riddles of existence. Conceptual powers are not needed to learn this, but only a solid and irreducible faith in the reality of the unseen God revealed in Jesus Christ, who alone has the 'words of eternal life' (John 6:68). Fidelity to prayer is the greatest safeguard of this faith against the distractions of godless thought. PRAYER AND GROWTH IN HOPE Faith, for all the rich wisdom it brings, is basically a simple and bare thing, a directedness of life to God in Christ. If it does not issue in action, in deeds of hope and love, then our prayers are only a luxury. The great task of prayer is the readjustment of life that it entails: if its light is not to be extinguished we must re fashion the order of our lives in accordance with it. Hence on illumination follows action; on the reversal of values which the thought of God effects follows the struggle to do his will. And prayer becomes an important weapon in this struggle. The range of human activity is not limited to the secular sphere, with its mechanical sys tem of cause and effect, ends and means. The praying Christian knows that all his temporal activities are caught up in a vast provi</page><page sequence="8">PRAYER AND LIFE 615 dential process which underpins all the struggles and hopes of secular history and assumes them into its design. He grasps the mysterious outline of this movement, by which God recalls all things to himself in Christ, and he puts his trust blindly in it, doing what he can to hasten it. He knows that God relies on his free actions, and on his prayers to accomplish his will. He realizes that his prayer is a fruitful and effective work of 'redeeming the time'. Guided by prayer his whole life becomes a pilgrimage, purpose ful though unmapped. He finds that doing the will of God is not conformity (the prayerless Christian's passive or grudging obedi ence) but the highest and most w/7predictable form of human creativity. Struggling in prayer and action to do God's will, he no longer sees time as a monotonous succession. He lives in the continually surprising present of creative hope. His service of God today is inspired by temporal goals only insofar as these are viewed in an eschatological perspective, i.e. the future towards which he struggles has become an image of eternity. Prayer trans forms time. It unifies life by a supernatural theme, which eludes the inexorable register of the calendar just as the soul of music eludes the artificial tick of the metronome. Without prayer we miss the call which is time's true meaning and our life is enslaved by a rigid schedule whose termini are birth and death. In prayer we should promote this transformation of life by referring all our material needs to God and by making of them expressions of our dependence on him. In prayers of petition our strongest weapon is our weakness. The springboard of this prayer is the recognition of need and the more intense our consciousness of need the more dynamic and expansive will our petitions become, and the more effective in catching the ear of God. At first we may feel need only in some particular area, but by presenting this to God in prayer we find that the 'ground of our beseeching' becomes deeper and deeper until finally our thirst is united with the thirst of Christ in the petitions of the 'Our Father'. In prayers of petition we again discover what an extraordinary richness and diversity is contained within the simple act of raising the mind and heart to God. Though he is immediately present to all, our prayer reaches him through a series of mediations, through the saints (both in via and in patria), through Mary, through Christ. It seems to be a law of prayer that it tends to expand in this way, to embrace all heaven and earth. Yet hope, though it has a cosmic extension and though it opens to our prayer the wonderfu? interpersonal richness of intercession is basically a very simple</page><page sequence="9">616 THE FURROW thing, a repeated act of reliance on God. It seems to me that a certain discomfort and tension normally accompanies the most fruitful prayer. We should strain and labour at prayer like St Patrick who used to stir himself up before the sunrise, in spite of rain, frost and snow, in order to implore God's aid : 'neque ulla pigritia erat in me, quia tune Spiritus f ervebat in me'. Prayer can and should become easy and spontaneous, but there is all the difference in the world between the spontaneity of a leisurely mood indulged and the spontaneity of the Holy Spirit, who teaches us to pray only if we clear the paths for him by our efforts. Prayer is not necessarily something that gushes forth unforced from the heart. It is higher than our hearts : it is the Holy Spirit himself who pleads within us. Our words and our thoughts are assumed in a movement of grace which our hearts must sustain, like some precious burden, attentively and untiringly. By patient fidelity to a rhythm of daily prayer we draw God's blessings down on our life. The experience of innumerable witnesses assures us that the manna falls abundantly : all that we are asked to do is to go to the trouble of collecting it. PRAYER AND GROWTH IN CHARITY In prayer life discovers its long forgotten name, its alpha and omega, which is love. We have seen how contemplation of the gospel opens our eyes to the 'divine milieu', a real invisible dimension, which transcends our subjective horizons. We have seen how the prayer of petition transforms our petty needs into active engagement in the salvific activity of providence. Love reveals itself as the ultimate ground of this transformation of mind and will. It was love that originally prompted these movements away from self towards the absolute otherness of God. Prayer is essentially a language of love. It is a sort of poetry, a poetry which effects what it signifies. For this poetry is not content with praising the beauty of people and things. It commends them lovingly into the hands of him from whom they came. Prayer culminates in the sacraments, especially in the Eucharist. Every time we pray with Stephen: 'Lord Jesus, receive my life', or with Christ: 'Father, into thy hands I commend my life', we are contri buting to the great Mass in which all things are united in Christ and offered to the Father through Christ. The effects of prayer in this respect may be concretely illustrated by the role it plays in the area of interpersonal relationships. I will give two mild examples. Suppose we are on cold terms</page><page sequence="10">PRAYER AND LIFE 617 with another person and find it difficult to summon up the sincere warmheartedness needed to heal the breach. If we brood on this, the situation worsens: suspicions and grievances pop up like Hydra's heads; our attitude towards the other person becomes denigratory and contemptuous. We harden in self-righteousness. But if instead of brooding we were to pray for that other person, we could only think loving, positive thoughts about him. As we pray our sympathy and respect for him would increase. We would see him in the context of God's love for us, the only context in which beings reveal their true identity. After praying we would find ourselves ready to meet the other with sincere openness and trust. So prayer puts us at peace with God and with our neighbour. Suppose we met some admirable and gifted person, one 'who hath a daily beauty in his life doth make ours ugly'. If we are unprayerful we may feel the stirrings of envy. We may coldly weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the other in some impersonal scale. But if we pray, envy is disarmed. Instead we give thanks, seeing God's glory reflected in the other person. We welcome him humbly and joyfully without any arriere-pensee of self-seeking. It is not necessary to recall the thousand and one other ways in which prayer deepens and enriches our relationships. If we bring to our neighbour the attitudes of poverty, meekness and patience ?vhich prayer forms in us and if we use the responses our neigh bour arouses in us as part of the language of our prayer (as St Ignatius uses the attitudes of romantic loyalty he had learned from military and court circles). We achieve a magnificent unity and interplay of divine and human loves in our life. This is the greatest triumph of Christian spirituality. If the foregoing remarks are unashamedly in the major key, with no mention of the dark aspects of life, of evil, suffering or death, this is because they are written from within the horizons of youth ful experience. In many ways prayer comes 'naturally' to young people as it does at no other time of life. Their natural optimism takes them to God in easy acceptance; their delight in life is augmented by the enrichment of grace; their ambition harmonizes well with asceticism. When the Bible says : 'Remember thy creator in the days of thy youth ...' more is intended than a killjoy and crabbed admonition against the naturalistic exaltation to which youth is prone. Surely youth is the ideal time to snatch the prize of prayer, and a youth deprived of this crowning blessing is only a half realized, mismanaged thing.</page></plain_text>
