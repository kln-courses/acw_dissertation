Pharos has now come of age and the present issue again focuses on chronologically disparate issues. Marietta Ioannidou, Greek women's magazines in the nineteenth century (p. 1-13), and Nicole van Wees, The September incidents. Anti- Greek riots in Istanbul in 1955 (p. 15-25), deal with modern history but are, in the reviewer's opinion, more anecdotic than true attempts by historians to explain particular features of recent Greek history. In The Temples of Athena Nike on the Acropolis of Athens. Ancient Measurements and Design (p. 27-48), Jos de Waele uses the recently discovered metrological relief from Salamis in which two new foot units (besides the Attic, Doric and Samian feet) are represented, to argue that every building in classical times had its own unit of measurement. The third season at Geraki. An Acropolis Site in Lakonia , by Joost H. Crouwel, Mieke Prent, Jasper</page><page sequence="2">594 COMPTES RENDUS Fiselier and Jos de Waele (p. 49-83) gives a detailed preliminary account of the first test excavations in 1997. Besides confirming the late date for the acropolis wall, the soundings especially revealed an Early Helladic II destruction level with a stone pendant (now published by J. Crouwel in P.P. Betancourt, V. Karageorghis, R. Laffineur &amp; W.-D. Niemeier (eds), Meletemata. Studies in Aegean Archaeology presented to Malcolm H. Wiener ( Aegaeum , 20), Liège &amp; Austin, 1999, p. 149-154) and the remains of a storeroom with, in situ , a pithos containing carbonised seeds and a number of clay fragments with impressions made by at least three different sealstones (now published in Oxford Journal of Archaeology 18, 1999, p. 357-376). Levelling operations during the Classical and Hellenistic periods are responsible for the scarcity of most other Bronze Age and Early Iron Age levels but Protogeometric, Geometric and Archaic sherds were found. Those structural remains not destroyed by Civil War operations mainly date to the Early Hellenistic period, which is also the date of a coin hoard. Separate reports by Fiselier on the geomorphology and de Waele on the presence of spolia in the Byzantine churches are added. Reinder Reinders, Stamatios Floras, Evangelia Karimali, Zo ï Malakasioti, Wietske Prummel, Vaso Rondiri, Ioannis Sgouras and Mies Wijnen, Karats' dhagli. A Neolithic Site in the Almirós plain (Thessaly, Greece ) (p. 85-143) report on the surface investigation in 1992 of an Early Neolithic site, situated in the heartland of Neolithic Thessaly (Achíllio, Pírasos, Sésklo). The site's proximity to the larger site of Magoúla Zerélia also offered interesting possibilities for comparison. Amongst the artefacts discovered are anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, 28 lithic artefacts, pottery and bone tools. It is hoped that future excavations at this or other Thessalian sites may help to corroborate the results of this survey. Jan DRIESSEN</page></plain_text>
