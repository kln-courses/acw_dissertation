<plain_text><page sequence="1">250 November2006 BOOKS IRELAND Hitching rides Alan O'Riordan Ihese days literary novelists like nothing better than embracing the enterprise of walking naked through casting off their cloaks and going in for genre fiction. John Banville might have gotten away with the trick if he hadn't won the Man Booker Prize; but having done so no publisher was going to let Benjamin Black move quietly into the detective fiction market. Not content with Banville's nom de plume being an open secret, Picador have even decided to tell us on the cover flap that "Benjamin Black is the pen name of acclaimed author John Banville." Nevertheless the reader, conscious or not, can suspend modernist formalism and postmodern ideas - that literature is self-reflexive; that language is cut off from the world; that art is consolation not knowledge; that style is the only substance - which make him seem increasingly quaint despite achievements such as his two great trilogies: Dr Copernicus, Kepler and The Newton Letter and The Book of Evidence, Ghosts and Athena. The Book of Evidence took Banville into the crime world too; notoriously it is his imagining of Malcolm Macarthur of c u b u -gate infamy as Freddie Montgomery. But there Banville takes a con-man as the ideal canvas for the practical application of his abiding epistemological doubts and stylistic self-negations. Montgomery "took up the study of science in order to find certainty. No, that's not it. Better to say, I took up science in order to make the lack of certainty more manageable... And [he] was good at it... it helped, to be without convictions as to the nature of reality, truth, ethics, all those big things/' The tone is similar to Nightspawn, Banville's first novel: I am talking about the past, about remembrance. You find no answers, only questions. It is enough, almost enough. That day I thought about the island, and now I think about thinking about the island and tomorrow, tomorrow I shall think about thinking about thinking about the island, and all will be one, however I try, and there will be no separate thoughts, but only one thought, one memory, and I shall still know nothing. And, it must be said, that of TheSea: Work is not a word I would apply to what I do. Work is too large a term, too serious. Workers work. The great ones work. As for us middling men, there is no word sufficiently modest that yet will be adequate to describe what we do and how we do it. Dabble I do not accept. It is amateurs who dabble, while we, the class orgenus of which I speak, are nothing if not professional. Banville's work always runs this risk: that books which tell us over and over "how tedious this is" do not seem self reflexively clever for long. In the end, they just convince us. So one expects a relief from all that with Christine Falls. Of course, there are Banvillesque touches - not least the way his characters are forever noticing smells, even when they Christine Falls.

For the most part, however, Black gives Banville a chance at simplicity. Christine Falb is a straightforward mystery story. A pathologist, Quirke, finds his brother-in-law, a doctor himself, doctoring a file in Quirke's office. It's the file of the eponymous Ms Falls and this chance intelligence leads Quirke into a web (Black even calls it a web) of sinister Catholicism that takes him from abortionists to Magdalene laundries and on to the Irish aristocracy of Boston. The plot has the right tempo - teasing yet exorable. 1950s Dublin is convincing if a tad cliched; in fact, the reader rather misses it when the story shifts to Boston. Quirke even has a drinking buddy modelled on Brendan Behan. Christine Falb is nothing if not generic, and satisfyingly so. They are all here: the heavies; a city hierarchy mysteriously propped up by the underworld; handy malcontents ready to spill the beans; the odd coincidence here and there; a lonely investigator, flawed but appealing. It's an enjoyable but not very compulsive read which leaves one wondering how much notice one would give it were one not aware it was the work of our best novelist.

There he introduced us to ex-NYPD detective Charlie Parker and set about putting his hero through a grisly mill of events starting with the murder of his wife and child. Connolly returned to Parker with his second novel, Deep Hollow. His talent for the grotesque and his almost Biblical sense of evil - no latter-day relativism for him - led him to introduce an element of the supernatural to this violent caper. The book is set in Maine, Stephen King's turf, so perhaps that was a case of "when in Rome.. but Connolly has since gone further. Though remaining in the style of naturalism, his last novel Black Angel involved baroque, Miltonic subject matter - fallen angels as well as fallen women. These twin strands are the source of Connolly's originality. They are also uncomfortable, unlikely bedfellows. The tradition of crime fiction is agnostic and its workings based on rationality. Infusing superstition and religiosity is bold and sometimes responsible for weak and unbelievable moments in Connolly's writing. Those misgivings are avoided with The Book of Lost Things. Here Connolly abandons the crime element to embrace whole-heartedly the mythical and supernatural aspect. He has produced a fable of the end of childhood that draws on C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, T. H. White, Robert Browning, Beowulf, The WizardofOz and even the animated film Shrek. The Book of Lost Things parallels the Narnia books in its premise. The scene is London during the Blitz. David, a young boy whose mother has recently died, moves with his father and step-mother to a house outside London. There he immerses himself in books, as his dead mother taught him to do. But the books in this house have a habit of talking back. David is the only one who can hear them. Connolly is good here - giving books personalities with</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND November20o6 251 pedantic dusty tomes mumbling and novels gushing sentimentally. David soon begins to see "the Crooked Man" - a Rumpelstiltskin figure from the land where stories begin who, for reasons that are never satisfying, needs to lure children into that realm for his continued survival. One night, David wanders into his garden as a German bomber crashes into it. Ducking for cover, he finds himself transported to the Crooked Man's world - with Connolly using the device to allow the rational "it was all a dream" ending to be flagged from the off. David is plunged into a world of anthropomorphic beasts and moving forests; the kind of place where men use the word 'abroad' when describing where 'strange beasts' are. In the Christian tradition of these tales, it is clear from the outset that all is not well in this kingdom and that David the interloper is some kind of reluctant saviour and possibly the next king. He is compelled to seek out the existing king and so begins his race against time across this fabulous landscape, pursued by an army of wolves and occasionally assisted by heroic menfolk. In Connolly's hands David's quest becomes a long Freudian dream. David confronts the psychosexual legacy of his mother, liberalised into a kind of "Childe Roland to the Tower Came" episode in which "he lays his sword by her side" (subtle that), as well as the jealousy he has for his stepsister when he realises the brutal reductio ad absurdum of these childish feelings in the mythical context where all the feelings of his subconscious are writ large in the language of fables. The sexual symbolism of folklore and fairytales is nothing new. Connolly adapts it into a metaphor for the end of childhood's innocent Eden and the beginning of puberty. This is a world where Little Red Riding Hood has sex with the wolf; where David is told by the Seven Dwarfs (who are, in a funny episode that nonetheless rests uneasily with the rest of the book, malcontent Marxists under the thumb of a fat and crude Snow White) that "ran away" means "eaten" and "happily ever after" means "eaten quickly". What's odd here is that an ostensibly grander ambition of The Book of Lost Things is not matched by any great length. Connolly usually gives us big reads of 500 pages or so; here the 300 pages seem almost threadbare. T. H. White saw Le Morte D'Arthur as a "quest for the end of war", but World War Two here is an irrelevant bit of colour - a thematic shotgun over the fireplace that remains unused in Act Three. Similarly, while the idea of a bookworm's intertextual dream is perfectly reasonable, it lends an underdeveloped, second-hand feel to the world Connolly creates. It's as if he's hitching a ride from the writers he's alluding to - using the readers' expectations, derived from their finely tuned, internally coherent worlds, to avoid such chores himself. As a result, the solution of the mystery of the Crooked Man and the abducted child kings answers the plot's "How?" requirement but never the "Why?" and, after all, myths are nothing if not an expression of man's unceasing appetite for answers to the latter question when there clearly are none.D</page></plain_text>
