<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER ANDERS Dark Horse MindSpace.net CAiiA-STAR, University of Plymouth, UK It's been more than twenty years since the com- puter entered the gates of architecture. Acclaimed as a new tool, it was a workhorse to replace the drafting table, save manhours, speed production's plow. Then, as now, exhortations ranged from gush- ing endorsement to outrage decrying the loss of craft. Yet both the rushed embrace and rejection betray a credulous grasp of computation. They pro- ject naive desires and fears, nostalgias for either the future or past. But what is the computer then, this horse wrapped in shadows? Is it a television? A design tool? A model-builder? No, it's a fax, a phone... a typewriter! Its shape changes in the fickle light of our expectations, shrouding its secrets in fading instrumentality - metaphors that lull us into error and misbelief. Indeed, if computation ends up a footnote in architecture's history, it will be in tribute to such complacency. Or, worse, intransigence. For rarely has the profession been so compelled to reassess not only its tools but its values and purpose as well. This issue of JAE will trace the influence of compu- tation in architecture and project it forward with a critical view of its effect. A-WARE, our title, employs a suffix common to now pervasive tools of architecture. While the prefix connotes architecture, artificial, it also negates the instrumentality of ware, hinting at the positions taken in these pages. But, in its totality, A-WARE alerts us. It compels us to actions not taken despite the cries of revolution. With its long silence on the matter, JAE showed stoic reserve. Yes, computers were important tools, but did they affect architec- tural history, design, or theory? This skepticism prevailed during the technology's infancy, but com- putation now clearly affects all that this journal values. New techniques arise from new technolo- gies. They inspire new thoughts, new forms, and so influence the course of events. Who would have thought this dark horse would stimulate a renais- sance of expressionism, brow-furrowing tangles of theory, or anxieties over authorship and agency? The reigning welter of gesture and confusion com- pels JAE to stand back and consider. To provide a synoptic view of trends in design computation and their influence on the profession. To raise awareness. In these fresh pages, we present an arc of computation's history, theory, and speculation. It begins and ends with historical surveys of architec- tural computation. These bracket articles on current trends: critiques of new formalism, autonomy of the design object, cybereal conflations in design, anthropomorphic reference, and a gallery of recent work by designers. This wide-eyed glimpse into the future is brought back to earth with a concluding, darker essay that bursts the bubbles of visionary hubris. We begin with Alfredo Andia's survey of archi- tectural computing. Anticipating Scott Johnson's closing piece, Andia distills a thirty-year evolution into a set of trends by which we can grasp the effect of technology. This taxonomy is handy for sorting out the varied product of design computation today. Conversely, Johnson's essay openly wonders whatever happened to the revolution. His sobering view of three decades of hype shows that not much has changed in practice. Apparently, the revolution was quelled; complacency won the first round. But the pages between Andia and Johnson offer us new hope, unexpected breaches in the wall. Ted Krueger's "Eliminate the Interface" promotes a liberating view of the design object, one that acknowledges the role of cognition on the part of the designer and, significantly, that of the artifact Dark Horse 4 Journal of Architectural Education, pp. 4-5 @ 2002 ACSA, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">as well. His essay obliges us to reconsider architects' responsibility within the extended design process. Can the artifact become a-ware? Cognition is also at stake in Warren Wake and Sally Levine's article, "Complementary Virtual Archi- tecture." Blurring distinctions between physical and cyberspaces, the authors describe architectural hybrids - which I've called cybrids - that partake of both worlds. Their article echoes current research on augmented and mixed reality in cultural technol- ogies. Like Krueger's piece, it opens new vistas for practice and theory. Brian Lonsway's piece is a sharp instrument for gutting formalist pretensions. His essay tar- gets the naive instrumentalization of computers and the errant use of metaphor in spatial represen- tation. He promotes a more robust (mature?) understanding of computational effect by denying the affectations of hyperbole and embracing la- tent but truly revolutionary aspects of computa- tion. Following this critique, a gallery opens onto a selection of projects, providing a palliative to this discourse. Comparing the gallery's themes is instructive - note the emphasis on the body, for instance -as is viewing them in the critical light of this issue. Admittedly, there is much that has been left out of these pages, such as telepresence, rapid prototyping, online communities, and robotics. However, even in its limited scope, A-WARE offers tools for evaluating effect, distinguishing traits, and moving forward. The digital revolution in architecture won't happen so long as computers remain misunder- stood. Yes, "nothing is new, only the instruments have changed." But this instrument is of such nature that it calls into question the very use to which it is put. For what happens when the inscrip- tions of architecture - its symbols, models, and vir- tual realities - supplant the objects of their use? Are we prepared to face the truth of design's agency: that architecture is a medium, not a prod- uct? For the artifacts of architecture are cognitive tools: symbols, metaphors, simulations, text of all kinds. The products of architectural processes, buildings and the like, may in themselves be tools for awareness: libraries, schools, museums, places of worship. This consciousness, this augmented aware- ness thematically underlies our issue. A-WARE refers to consciousness. It's not about information technology per se, but about memory and cognition, human and cultural knowledge. It's about what information undergoes - manipula- tion, spatialization, appreciation- to become knowledge, experience. It is not about technolo- gies - computers, networks, or buildings - it's how we use them to extend ourselves to our world and one another. No, the real revolution hasn't happened. But disciplinary vigilance - for some, paranoia - is war- ranted. Technology threatens those dozing in their complacency: architecture's Trojans; those who con- fuse buildings for architecture, tools for technology; those materialists of space blind to its cognitive worth. It is they who must be alert, poised, aware - for the horse has entered their gates and night falls. Keller Easterling and Peter Anders are coeditors of this special theme issue on digital technology and architecture. 5 ANDERS</page></plain_text>
