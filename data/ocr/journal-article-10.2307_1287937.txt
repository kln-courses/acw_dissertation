THE LESSONS OF EARLY LAW ----- 69 EARLY legislation may excite the condescending interest that Dr. Johnson directed toward a dog walking on its hind legs: "It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all."1 British wild- life law, however, merits more respect. As long ago as the Middle Ages, man's appetite for meat endowed legislators with at least an ambling competence at wildlife management. Nor has the passage of time made their efforts wholly irrelevant. Early methods of con- trolling habitat, for example, may still be appropriate since historical change has not altered the needs of animals as it has those of men. This is not to say that within the bestiary of early British law there does not run many a droll species of regulation, amusing only be- cause of its ludicrous appearance. Indeed, within the following dis- cussion of the goals and methods of those laws, a kind of carnival fever may appear at times to have overtaken the legislators. But such are the parallels between early problems and those faced today that in the end, to a surprising degree, the stock of old laws can still provide exemplary service. * Associate Professor of Law, University of Houston, Bates College of Law.

Birbeck Hill ed. 1921). 49</page><page sequence="2">Michigan Law Review I. GOALS Wildlife law has four major goals, and early British legislation recognized them all. First, laws can facilitate the sustained periodic harvest of wildlife. Wildlife management can be designed with the same balance sheet mentality that characterizes any ranching opera- tion, with adjustments made for the peculiarities of wild stock. Sec- ond, wildlife statutes can be drawn primarily to regulate human be- havior. Because hunting provides one of the few justifications for the use of weapons, laws purportedly enacted to control hunting may actually be designed either to restrict or to encourage the use of weapons. Moreover, hunters themselves may solicit limitations on their freedom to use certain hunting methods, thereby enhancing their sport by increasing the challenge to their skill. Third, wildlife laws can be designed to favor particular groups. Because wild ani- mals are not ordinarily subject to man's control, and control seems the basis for most popular views of ownership, wildlife may be treated as a unique form of wealth. Lawmakers may thus be able to grant hunting privileges to a favored group without exciting the contention that would ensue were privileges granted with respect to other forms of property. Fourth, wildlife regulations can aim to vin- dicate what are supposed to be the desires of the animals themselves. While some assert that rights can belong only to people,2 a curious convergence of both very primitive and very sophisticated law would protect the rights of other than human supplicants.3 Living wild ani- mals have been a congenial vehicle for the manifestation of this doc- trine. A. Sustained Yield The concept that the yearly harvest of a species might be limited so that the remaining numbers can breed and replenish the stock has been the common intellectual property of mankind since the dawn of the pastoral era.4 The numbers and the breeding habits of wild animals, however, are less obvious than those of domestic beasts; techniques to manage wildlife for sustained yield have there- fore been more difficult to develop. 2. See, e.g., Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration, 175 Mass. 71, 76, 55 N.E. 812, 814 (1900) (Holmes, C.J.) ("All proceedings, like all rights, are really against persons"). 3. See C.

BRONOWSKI, THE ASCENT OF MAN 59-89 (1973). 50 [Vol. 74:49</page><page sequence="3">British Wildlife Law The final slaughter of British wolves, said to have been called for by Kings Edgar and Canute,5 proved that intensive hunting could destroy a species. The information necessary to manage a harvest for sustained yield, however, was more complex than that required for extermination. The population dynamics of different species vary widely, and estimation of the resiliency of a species in the face of large breeding stock depletions is no simple task.6 Some early English laws reflect this difficulty. At one time the legislators be- lieved that hares had been "amost utterly destroyed"7 by hunting, an event that Australians might wish to have been more likely. A cor- vine irruption of the sixteenth century was also less susceptible to man's efforts at control than was believed by framers of a bounty measure.8 The lawmakers feared: "[Ilf the said crows, rooks and choughs should be suffered to breed and continue, as they have been in certain years past, they will undoubtedly be the cause of the great destruction and consumption of a great part of the corn and grain which hereafter shall be sown throughout this realm . . ."9 For- tunately, however, the danger to Britain was not nearly so grave. Hunting incentives or restrictions do not significantly affect the total numbers of a species when human pressure simply substitutes for natural causes of mortality and prematurely removes individual animals that would not in any case have affected the breeding pool.10 The arts of weaponry were so poorly developed and the numbers of hunters were generally so limited that early lawmakers did not need to restrict the harvest to the degree presently necessary. But when unusual conditions did endanger a desirable species, British lawmakers acted to preserve the stock. Damming was recognized as an industrial peril to anadromous fish as early as the fourteenth century, and weirs were required in dams to facilitate spawning-runs 5. J. MANWOOD, TREATISE OF THE FOREST LAws 161 (4th ed. W. Nelson 1717). 6.

In a resilient population, severe loss rates may in effect substitute for each other without mounting up excessively high in total. Extraordinary losses through one agency may automatically protect from losses through many other agencies. The death of one individual may mean little more than improving the chances for living of another one. Furthermore, in some species, extraordinary losses may be compensated by accelerated reproduction, more young being pro- duced in consequence of more being destroyed. P. ERRINGTON, OF PREDATION AND LIFE 229 (1967). 51 November 1975]</page><page sequence="4">Michigan Law Review ascending the streams.'1 The legislators also restricted particular methods of taking against which a species was thought defenseless. Hares could not be tracked in the snow;12 nor could herons, vulner- able targets indeed, be taken by firearms.13 The income that can be derived from the sustained yield of wild- life can be both a factor in and an incentive toward management. It has recently been established as such in the United States; from 1955 to 1965 the annual income derived by American landowners from hunting and fishing increased from $3 million to $97 million.'4 In the early nineteenth century the importance of this consideration was emphasized by scholars who advocated changes in the British law. Edward Christian, Professor of Law at Cambridge, asserted that, were occupiers allowed rights to game, "it would soon become a serious and most important problem for the agriculturist to solve, viz. What quantity of Game should be supported and sold upon a given farm, or what proportion it should bear to the vegetable pro- duction, that the sum of both should be the greatest, or would best enable the occupier to pay his rent and maintain his family."5 B. Weapons Control 1. In Earnest Hunting rules can achieve a serious martial goal. Except for tar- get practice and self-defense, hunting provides the only lawful occa- sion for a private citizen to use weapons. And, particularly with the limited arsenal of weapons formerly available, a practiced sportsman might be far superior to an amateur in martial skills. The security of the established rule will therefore be increased if government sup- porters are encouraged to hunt and potential dissidents are prohib- ited from hunting.'6 The British have always been adept at finding a serious purpose 11. 17 Rich. 2, c. 9, ? 1 (1393). 12. 14 &amp; 15 Hen. 8, c. 10 (1522). 13. 19 Hen. 7, c. 11, ? 1 (1503). 14.

Considerably before Wellington saw the earnest goals of youthful sport ("The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton . . ."),17 legislators had proclaimed that unless hunt- ing were wisely practiced, the security of the realm would be endan- gered. Not long after the rout of the French at Agincourt, a law was designed to ensure continued British skill with the long bow. Ac- cording to the legislative prologue, that weapon had "subdued and reduced divers and many regions and countries to their due obeisance, to the great honour, fame and surety of th[e] realm and subjects, and to the terrible dread and fear of all strange nations. .."18 The use of new hunting techniques might have sapped Britain's strength; controls were therefore imposed to prevent the citizenry from relying too heavily on that novelty, the gun.19 While affording supporters of the crown continued practice with arms, British game laws20 also sought to disarm dissidents.21 Black- stone maintained that the earliest game laws were part of feudal pol- icy to exclude the defeated from the use of arms: "[N]othing could do this more effectually than a prohibition of hunting and sporting. . . .22 Although their purpose might be "oftener meant than avowed," subsequent legislators continued to espouse this policy.23 Some propagandist maintained that these covert aims underlay hunt- ing rules imposed after the bloodless revolution: Before these useful laws were made, Each lively youth, each jolly blade Well knew the use of hostile arms, Ready prepared for war's alarms, But since we have a Revolution And alter'd much our Constitution, It is decreed, each Bird-each Beast, Shall have in part Quietum est ....24 17.

"Game" has been a term of art narrowly limned. Professor Christian, for example, observed regarding a statute including as "game" pigeon, fish, and fowl: "Could anyone have supposed this possible in a land of learning and liberty?" E.

November 1975] 53</page><page sequence="6">Michigan Law Review Some early legislators did not conceal their belief that unless un- reliable elements were forbidden the use of weapons, they would become competent with arms and then imperil the safety of the country. Fourteenth century lawmakers had instituted hunting reg- ulations because they had observed that "sometime under such colour [of hunting, groups] make their assemblies, conferences, and conspiracies for to rise and disobey their allegiance ... . 25 Sub- sequent statutes identified even more precisely the danger posed by permitting the poor to use weapons: Tempted to poach, they might experience success and then turn to such graver offenses as burglary and highway robbery.26 Incidents, even in the early nineteenth century, show that the challenge by poachers to civil authority was not insignificant. Testi- mony before the House of Lords Committee on the Game Laws gives an idea of the force poachers could mount: In the middle of November 1826, a large concourse of poachers, to the amounts of about 50, attacked a wood of mine, at about half past eleven in the evening; about 28 of them were armed with guns, about 12 with sticks, the remainder with a stone in each hand, by which they kept making noise by knocking them against each other, for the purpose of keeping the persons in line going through the woods; and on the outside of the wood were two men on horse back, about 50 yards from one another, who had horns, and they directed in which way the line should be carried on. In that way they thor- oughly went through the wood, firing a great number of times, and killed a large quantity of Pheasants. My keepers were there, but finding the force was very large, they were unable to cope with them; and according to the orders I always gave them, not to have any af- fray of that nature, unless they were sure of being successful, they were only able to look on, and not to take any steps for saving the Game.27 25. 13 Rich. 2, c. 13, ? 1 (1389). 26. See, e.g., 4 &amp; 5 W. &amp; M., c. 23, ? 1 (1692). As one commentator observed, "[A]Il the statutes made for the preservation of the game, agree in the character of such men; for they tell us, that they are of the vulgar sort, and of little or no worth; that they are loose, idle, disorderly and dissolute persons; that they ruin themselves and families, and damnify their neighbors; and by neglecting all lawful employment, they commonly turn highwaymen and burglars."

Another taste of the dangers presented by resistance to the game laws is provided by a warning protesting the penalty of transportation for poaching that was sent in 1816 to prominent landown- ers near Bath: [T]he first of our country that this law is inflicted on . .. there shall not one gentleman's seat in our country escape the rage of fire. We are nine in number; and we will burn every gentleman's house of note. The first that impeaches shall be shot. We have sworn not to impeach. You may think it a threat, but 54 [Vol. 74:49</page><page sequence="7">British Wildlife Law These dangers were part of the inspiration for a scheme known generally as the "qualification statutes," which allowed the use of various weapons for hunting only to those with a vested interest in the established rule.28 Thereby did the law both arm the powerful and disarm those whom Blackstone described as the "rustici."29 The caste-like overtones of the scheme were emphasized by enforcement provisions that authorized the qualified to disarm the unqualified.30 2. For Fun Because the qualification statutes ensured that everyone legally interested in game could fill his belly by other means, no great emer- gency required that wildlife be harvested in an effective and efficient manner. A hunter's goal might not be to bag his quarry with maxi- mum dispatch, but rather to delay the pleasure as long as decently possible. Besides being too effective and thereby spoiling good sport, some hunting practices were abhorrent because they were unpleas- ant to a person of sensitivity. Rudimentary firearms, for example, were not elegant. They were loud and smelly. Through the seven- teenth century they were "fired by a match, and [were] thought a mode of killing game not fit to be pursued by a gentleman."31 Their use was restricted.32 Considerations of taste also helped to prohibit a practice now described as "jacklighting,"33 but during the sixteenth century called hunting by "lowbels." Groups would venture forth after dark ringing bells and flashing lights and then easily gather up partridges and pheasants stupefied by the spectacle.34 The comedic overtones of this sport coupled with its lethal efficiency led to its prohibition.35 C. Class Discrimination The third goal of wildlife regulation has been to secure unequal distribution of the right to utilize wildlife. In other areas of the law, they will find it a reality. The Game Laws were too severe before. The Lord of all men sent these animals for the peasant as well as the prince. Quoted in E. CHRISTAN, supra note 15, at 292-94. 28.

Class discriminations were openly embraced from the earliest periods until at least the mid-nineteenth century. Their legacy of ill feelings may still imbue some condemnation of wildlife protectors as "elitists."87 In 1389, the course of wildlife law was confirmed by a reference to "gentlemen's game,"38 and this attitude was elaborated into a comprehensive scheme in the qualification statutes. Until their abo- lition in 1831,39 the qualification statutes allowed only prominent cit- izens to take game, to possess certain weapons, and ultimately, to eat certain animals. Although codes of conduct contemporaneous with early qualifi- cation statutes provided some means for identifying a gentleman, the British legislators generally took a more pragmatic view. Money was the principal touchstone. The earliest qualification statute al- lowed hunting rights only to a lay person who owned lands worth forty shillings annually or to a cleric who held a yearly living of ten pounds.40 The value of the base land was later raised to one hundred pounds.4" Wealth was also a test for the use of hunting gear. One statute, with limited exceptions, denied the use of hand- guns to those with an estate worth less than one hundred pounds.42 Naked figures mean something, of course, only to those savants familiar with the exchange rate between different historical periods. Blackstone's juxtaposition of two different qualifications provides a more vivid perspective on the statutes' effect: "[Flifty times the property [is required] to enable a man to kill a partridge, as to vote for a knight of the shire . .. ."43 Some of the statutes eschewed the reliable monetary test and in- 36.

One limited the use of hailshot (an early form of shotgun) to those of the "degree of a Lord of the Parlia- ment."44 Another reserved the power to appoint gamekeepers to "lords of manors, or other royalties, not under the degree of an es- quire . . ..45 While "the degree of an esquire" clearly did not comprehend every base scrivener, the term was imprecise. One commentator explained that the title belonged to "whomever either by blood, or place in the state, or other eminency, we conceive some higher attribute should be given than that sole title of gentleman. . . ."46 Other views had it that the title belonged to those "whose fortune can enable them to maintain an army of gamekeepers, and whose nerves are sufficiently firm to risk the constant exposure of human life in the protection of a mere amusement."47 Precedent was ample for the gentry's appropriation of the right to hunt,48 but perhaps excepting the Olympian policy regarding am- brosia, no ruling class had ever sought to corer a particular food. Culinary monopoly, however, was a salient goal of the British game laws in their mature form. It had been perceived only gradually as a worthy end for legislation. The various restrictions on hunting had only barred the lower classes from themselves running the animals to earth; they might still buy the meat on the open market. But subsequently, the sale of game was restricted in such a way as to disclose a vigorous intent to preserve game from contact with a base gullet. At first the law restricted the purchase of game only if it were then held for resale; one might patronize a poacher if one intended to eat the meat oneself.49 As with today's de facto law of prostitu- tion, the sale was illegal but the purchase was not. This exception, however, allowed both the qualified and the unqualified to eat game, and that was inconsistent with the socially discriminatory policy be- hind the restrictions. So, while purchase for consumption remained legal, a statutory presumption was established that any unqualified person who possessed game held it for the purpose of resale.5?

With these restrictions protecting the status of game, it attained an "artificial pre-eminence"51 and became the delicacy without which no feast would be complete.52 During the heyday of the re- strictions on sale, for example, the chief official of London cele- brated Lord Mayor's Day with a banquet including seventy dishes of partridge, pheasant, and hare, all animals that legally could not be sold.53 Several rationales might be advanced for this unusual concern with who might taste certain meat, explanations that need not rely on the alchemical eighteenth century critique that "[o]ne would al- most be tempted to think, from the peculiar attention the legislature hath in all ages paid to the preservation of the Game, that there was some sovereign medicinal quality in the blood and juices of these animals . .. . "54 One possible explanation is that, during the earli- est periods of regulation, wildlife was a considerable part of the pro- ductivity of land. This was particularly true when many large tracts had not been subdued to domestic agriculture. Wildlife had in fact been allocated to various feudal vassals, Blackstone asserted, in order to shore-up their power and allegiance.55 This theory is not wholly satisfactory, however, because in subsequent years wildlife became economically less significant and qualification statutes continued to be enacted and enforced. Qualification statutes might have been justified on the theory that they gave the landowner rights to what, after all, was supported by his land.56 This rationale, however, fails to account for two as- 51.

One nineteenth century commentator stated: As to the defence of the landowner against qualified persons, we often read no- tices to the following effect: "Qualified persons are requested not to trespass on these woods, &amp;c.: all trespassers will be prosecuted:" that is to say, a man pur- chases lands, he incurs great expense in turning out, feeding, and watching his 58 [Vol. 74:49</page><page sequence="11">British Wildlife Law pects of the qualification scheme. Under typical statutes, owners of properties worth less than the statutory amount who were equally subject to wildlife depredations were not qualified to kill the damag- ing animals.57 On the other hand, some statutes qualified the so- cially eminent without regard to whether they owned any land at all.58 A fourteenth-century eleemosynary rationale postulated that the system was conceived not to favor the powerful, but to improve the weak: While hunting might concededly be an amusing diversion, the pastime could ensnare those without sufficient responsibility to see where first duties lay. Legislators had in fact observed that "div- ers artificers, labourers, and servants, and grooms" had indulged in hunting even "on the holydays, when good Christian people be at church, hearing divine service .. ."59 The qualification statutes were therefore designed to help these misdirected souls. Further- more, the denial of game to certain groups might be the last spur necessary to encourage them to surmount their lethargy and apply themselves with the degree of effort needed to join the ranks of the elite. As a Member of Parliament from Oxford explained, the qual- ification statutes actually were "inducements to the acquisition of learning and honour, and to the perserverance necessary to attain the stations which conferred them .... [Thus, they were] cheap incentives to exertion."60 Finally, a proto-Marxist approach examined the consequences to productivity if game were available to all. Labor would then fall to short supply, for "it will scarcely be contended that the labourer would prefer continued toil and low wages to occasional indolence and high profits. If the peace or safety of the country was really game, and he humbly requests persons, who are protected by superior property or rank from summary process, not to rob him of that which he has acquired. Should such trespasser be detected, the proprietor has the enviable power of com- paring purses with him, by action at law in our courts, which, like the London Tavern, always open their doors to those who are able to pay.

Wildlife Rights The vindication of the supposed desires of wild animals them- selves is the fourth purpose of wildlife law. That the law can recog- nize nonhuman rights has recently been reemphasized (or, perhaps more accurately, rediscovered) in the United States, notably by Pro- fessor Stone63 and Justice Douglas.64 Early Englishmen perceived the transition from nonhuman to human as a continuum rather than a sharp break;65 the view that animals themselves might possess rights was therefore not preposter- ous to them.66 Indeed, protection of the rights of animals was con- sistent with the widespread practice of holding them for their wrongs67 and required only that a champion be found to assert their interests. That spokesman was the king.

MANWOOD, supra note 5, preface. 60 [Vol. 74:49</page><page sequence="13">British Wildlife Law special doctrines protected wildlife, special officials policed those regulations,69 and special courts balanced the rights of men against the rights of wildlife.70 One might contend that the system was conceived not to vindi- cate wildlife rights, but to foster sport for the king and those to whom he had granted his authority. The brute wards of the jurisdiction did apparently include only those species that provided good hunt- ing. On the other hand, John Manwood, a scholar and judge dur- ing the sixteenth century who attempted to revive the system from desuetude, surmised that hunting sport was not the only end the sys- tem sought to achieve. Rather, he asserted, the king found "[d]elight and [p]leasure" from those animals that might "rest and abide" within the forest, content in his "safe [p]rotection."72 Whatever its basic purpose, the jurisdiction provides a striking example of a sophisticated legal system constructed upon the premise that animals themselves hold rights and that those rights should be vindicated by officials of the state. For example, while tort doctrine outside the forest dealt with wrongs against men, that inside the forest was primarily concerned with wrongs against wildlife. These wrongs were categorized according to the immediacy of their effect on wildlife. "Nocumentum speciale" prohibited those actions most directly injuring wildlife, such as the unauthorized release of hunting dogs within the forest.73 "Nocumentum commune," in contrast, was an act or omission that harmed men within the forest, such as the improper construction of a dam or the failure to keep a bridge in good repair.74 But part of the reason for the prohibition of "nocumentum commune," Manwood explained, was the ultimate ef- fect of such wrongs on wildlife.75 An unrepaired bridge would cause people to detour from pathways and thereby disrupt wildlife 69.

Plants were divided into categories according to their importance to forest animals. The doctrine of "special vert" gave particular pro- tection to the mast- and fruit-bearing plants on which deer fed.76 But appreciation was also manifest for the role of vegetation as shelter for wildlife from predation and weather; "nocumentum generale" re- stricted the cutting of any plants that grew in sufficient density to provide cover.77 That wildlife was fundamental to the jurisdiction is also indicated by Manwood's assertion that when wildlife did not in fact live within an area of the forest, the forest dwellers might with impunity violate the prohibitions of its law.78 E. The Interrelationship of the Goals Because the goals of wildlife law are not invariably consistent with one another, their interrelationships are significant. For exam- ple, while it may be an exercise in anthropomorphism to believe that animals want to live, they certainly dislike pain. Rules that author- ize hunting therefore may contravene the preferences of the hunted animals themselves.79 Hunting laws, however, may be conducive to the health of the hunted species as a whole. Reproductive patterns have evolved to compensate for predation, and where man elim- inates natural predators, as by the extermination of wolves in early Britain,80 the prey species may suffer a population irruption. Its food supply may then be destroyed by overconsumption, which in turn may lead to starvation, disease, and death for much of the pop- ulation.81 In such cases, a sustained-yield policy may paradoxically support a larger number of animals than would survive were all hunt- ing prohibited.82 Moreover, to the extent that wildlife is valued as 76.

The Forest Jurisdiction well demonstrates the benefits that wildlife may derive from an interest in hunting. Policies aimed at a sustained yield of wildlife may also seem in- consistent with sporting rules that restrict the use of effective weapons. These rules, which increase the costs of harvesting wild- life, appear to conflict with the economic model that ranching pro- vides: If "fair play" is not at issue in rounding up cattle, it might be equally inappropriate in harvesting deer. Law enforcement problems, however, may make early British practices defensible as the only practicable method to have ensured a sustained yearly harvest. A limit on the number of animals a hunter may kill might appear to be a more economically efficient way to assure that no species is reduced below the number that can provide a steady yield, but the difficulty of administering such limits might have made them unenforceable. When a large part of Britain was rustic or wild, the police problems involved in establishing that a hunter had exceeded his limit would have been far greater than those involved in estab- lishing that he was hunting at an improper time or with a prohibited apparatus. The qualification statutes also appear to have been an effective, although discriminatory, method to protect wildlife against excessive pressure. But as large numbers of people came to abhor the scheme, the difficulties of enforcement increased. Those who op- posed the qualification statutes were so numerous by the eighteenth century that illegal hunting may have reduced the wildlife population below that which a more acceptable policy would have preserved.83 Resistance to the law was not confined to the unqualified. Qualified landowners might not only ignore poaching, but also per- petrate subterfuges to help the unqualified circumvent the law. Many of the unqualified were fraudulently appointed "gamekeep- ers" and as such authorized to hunt. In 1710, a limitation was im- posed that a manor might have only one gamekeeper,84 but despite this restriction the practice continued.

As a parliamentary committee considering the qualifica- tion statutes observed: [T]hose possessors of land who fall within the statuable disqualifica- tions feel little or no interest in the preservation of Game; . . . they are less active in repressing the baneful practice of poaching, than if they remained entitled to kill and enjoy the Game found upon their own lands. Nor is it unnatural to suppose, that the injury done to the crops in those situations where Game is superabundant, may in- duce the possessors of land, thus circumstanced, rather to encourage than to suppress illegal modes of destroying it.86 II. METHODS Whatever the purposes of wildlife regulations, the methods em- ployed have been divided by ecologists into three categories: re- strictions on the take, habitat improvement, and artificial stocking.87 The former two are germane to British law prior to the American Revolution.88 A. Take Limitations The size of the take was restricted in Britain by four legislative techniques: (1) only limited numbers might hunt (2) during re- stricted periods (3) with controlled apparatus (4) for animals whose value had been reduced. The qualification statutes were the principal means used in Brit- ish law to restrict the number of hunters. They were defended, even during the waning years of the system, as a method to preserve game. As one apologist asserted, "[A]dmit a general right to take wild animals, and one of two things must follow-Game would be utterly destroyed or it would not."89 Although the latter prospect 85. 3 Geo. 1, c. 11, ? 1 (1716). 86.

While stocking was extensively practiced in game parks, the technique was not closely regulated by law. 89. C. LONG, supra note 15, at 31. 64 [Vol. 74:49</page><page sequence="17">British Wildlife Law may have been the more repugnant since it would have freed the rustic proletariat of the need to labor for their employers' benefit, the former was also to be feared, and the qualification statutes were equally intended to forestall this danger. The second legislative technique-limiting the periods for wild- life taking-may in turn have secured several goals. First, it may have reduced the take to an extent that could not be offset by increased hunting during the "open period." British prohibi- tion of hunting on those days when the legislators commended church attendance9? prevented many hunters from simply shifting their take to another time. Since virtually all holidays had some re- ligious significance, only those without ordinary work (typically the rich and the poor) would have the leisure to hunt at other times. Second, this technique was apparently used to restrict taking dur- ing those periods in the life cycle of a species when taking would be unproductive. Periods in a species' life cycle might be distin- guished with respect to the animal's reproductive behavior, ability to evade capture, and value as a commodity. Early British law de- veloped several doctrines to protect game during vulnerable repro- ductive periods. Deer fawning season was the occasion for "fence- month" within the Forest Jurisdiction.9" Forest officials annually convened before this time to devise strategies to make law enforce- ment more effective, thereby to preserve the animals from any dis- turbance.92 Other laws also gave particular attention to breeding animals: gathering the eggs of birds was prohibited,93 and, in the eighteenth century, salmon were protected during their spawning runs so that they might "become very plentiful and common . . . as they were formerly . .. ."94 Physical changes in animals' defensive abilities were also the oc- casion for British regulations. Birds were protected when "the said old fowl be moulted, and not replenished with feathers to fly, nor the young fowl fully feathered perfectly to fly ... ."95 A subse- quent moulting bird statute further exemplifies the technique of lim- iting the take to those periods when the animals would be most valu- able. The season was justified on the basis that the flesh of moult- 90. 13 Geo. 3, c. 80, ? 6 (1773). 91. J. MANWOOD, supra note 5, at 134. 92. Id. at 136-37. 93.

A seventeenth- century law set a minimum size for lobsters.97 Fish fry required ex- press protection because "in divers places they feed swine and dogs with the fry and spawn of fish . . ..98 A sixteenth-century law limiting hunting in fields while grain was in ear99 typifies the last purpose of restrictive hunting periods-mini- mizing interference by hunters with other productive activities. The third legislative method of limiting take-controlling ap- paratus-was embodied in the prohibition of various hunting meth- ods found to be wasteful, excessively successful, or "unsporting." Minimum net sizes protected fish fry,100 jacklighting was restrict- ed,101 and hunters of herons were limited to hawking or the long bow.102 The qualification statutes often prohibited not only the tak- ing of game, but also the possession of hunting apparatus.103 The final legislative technique-decreasing the value of an ani- mal-is an effective means of reducing the harvest. Wildlife is typ- ically taken in areas that pose difficulties to law enforcement. By changing the operative fact for the offense from capture to sale, leg- islators can shift violations of the game laws to a public and social context. Although this technique was recognized by early British lawmakers,'04 it was not found sufficiently politic to employ rigor- ously. Sale and purchase by the unqualified was restricted,'05 but such was the "artificial pre-eminence of Game," "a forbidden 96. 9 Anne, c. 25, ? 4 (1710).

Habitat Development Regulating the takers of wildlife is an obvious method of control- ling animal numbers. But that technique is not the most effective way to deal with diminishing populations. As two distinguished ecologists have asserted: "When game begins to get scarce, people generally think and act in the order [of (1) preservation of breed- ing stock by means of game laws restricting the harvest; (2) artificial stocking; and (3) habitat improvement], which is sometimes unfor- tunate, since the third item is often more important than the first two. If suitable habitat is lacking ... protection or stocking is use- less."109 British legislators at the earliest stage regarded the development of wildlife habitat as essential to wildlife preservation. While the Forest Jurisdiction differed from some present-day wildlife reserves in that the jurisdiction by design included private land holdings that were farmed and developed for other uses,11 the forest law sought to harmonize these uses with the requirements of wildlife habitat. A landowner, for example, might develop his property, but he was required to retain adequate vegetation for wildlife forage and cover.lll Moreover, all land within the forest was subject to an ease- ment for the benefit of wildlife so that during the winter, when browse was scarce, forest officials might enter private land and cut down vegetation and take branches to feed wildlife.l2 106.

The forest law restricted some com- moners to the number of stock that could be fed on their own land during the winter.l14 A "commoner sans number," who by the com- mon law could run stock without limit, by the forest law was required to preserve wildlife forage.115 Shepherding practices were subject to a prohibition against "staff-herding." Herders were prohibited from driving their cattle from pasture to pasture within the forest because the shepherds' presence would deter deer from exercising their equal rights to these productive areas.116 Restrictions limited the possession of other animals that posed dangers to forest wildlife. A license was required to run sheep or goats because those stock "taint the pasture where they feed, that the beasts of the forest will not depasture there; so that they do, as it were, banish them from every place where they are."117 Watch- dogs were potentially even more damaging to wildlife, and Manwood described the draconian measure employed to forestall their aggres- siveness: Three claws of the fore-feet shall be cut off by the Skin: And accord- ingly the same is now used, by setting one of his Fore-feet upon a piece of Wood eight Inches thick, and a Foot square, and then setting a Chisel of two Inches broad upon the three Claws of his Fore-foot, to strike them off at one Blow; and this is the manner of expediting Mastiffs.ll8 Where there was insufficient forage for both game and stock, the grantee of the rights for domestic forage had to reduce his herd.

THE LESSONS OF EARLY LAW Three areas of current concern for those interested in wildlife are the destruction of wildlife habitat for economic development, the relationship between gun control and wildlife law, and the conflict between hunters and those interested in wildlife for other reasons. While early British law may not be binding precedent in these areas,121 the system is a worthwhile counterpoise against which to balance current policies. Although the Second Circuit has observed that cost "in our afflu- ent society . . . is only one of several factors" to be considered in determining whether environmental values should be preserved,"'22 economic crises repeatedly undercut policies that limit economic productivity. From the vantage point of early British law, with its willingness to protect wildlife habitat at the expense of power pro- duction,l23 lumbering,24 and food resources,125 recent restrictions can be viewed not as novel incursions into the "rights" of property owners, but rather as the continuing manifestations of regulations long a part of Anglo-American jurisprudence. Present resistance to the federal statute protecting eagles,l26 for example, appears im- proper in light of the ancient history of raptor preservation. Even in the fifteenth century, landowners were prohibited from disturbing various hawks regardless of "any hurt by them done . . ." Nor did the law countenance indirect measures to eliminate these valued birds: no landowner might "purposely drive them out of their coverts accustomed to breed in, to cause them to go to other coverts to breed . . ." All men were to "suffer them to pass at their liber- 120. Id. at 99. 121. See Van Ness v.

But British wildlife law further shows that landowners subject to wildlife damage have at times been compensated for that cost. The Forest Jurisdiction granted subject landowners special rights of com- mon in the forest.129 This early policy might be considered, for ex- ample, in settling the persistent controversy regarding the historic federal policy permitting landowners in the western United States to pasture stock in adjoining public lands for a charge less than the fair market value of the grazing rights.130 Where base properties are subject to depredations as wildlife move between federal and pri- vate land, one might defend landowner privileges within federal lands on the same basis that John Manwood rationalized those of the forest inhabitants: "[S]ince the deer have fed on their grounds, 'tis reasonable they should have common."131 The demise of the British qualification statutes provides an ex- ample of the difficulty of instituting and enforcing policies that are bitterly disputed by the landowners controlling wildlife habitat. Pro- vision of compensation for wildlife burdens may help make restric- tive laws more palatable. This theme has been emphasized by other commentators on wildlife policy. Professor Christian concluded from the history of wildlife law that, were the land occupier given some right to game, soon he would thoughtfully consider how he might support rather than destroy those animals upon his land.132 Aldo Leopold, a prominent American conservationist, observed: "The only conceivable motive which might activate a sufficient num- ber of non-shooting landholders [to manage for game] is the finan- cial motive."133 This thought finally has been transformed into policy in states such as Texas, where a game department official recently stated: 127. 11 Hen. 7, c. 17, ? 17 (1494). 128.

Six of these old does eat as much as one 750-pound cow, five sheep or five goats. So it has been neces- sary for our Department to approach the ranger who is producing the game on some sort of a basis which he recognizes, and that basis of course, is the dollar bill.134 The lessons of the qualification statutes with regard to both the privilege to use weapons and the privilege to enjoy wildlife are some- what more ambiguous. Blackstone's reprobation of the forest and game laws as owing "their immediate original to slavery"135 provided an impelling spirit for American opposition to gun control. His fervor may have led him to an attitude of vigilant resistance even to apparently necessary regulation.16 Indeed, an American editor of Blackstone observed in 1803 that "[a]n attentive perusal" of Blackstone's commentary establishes that the game laws are among the powerful instruments of state-enginery, for the purpose of retaining the mass of the people in a state of the most abject sub- jection . . . so that the whole nation are completely disarmed, and left at the mercy of the government, under the pretext of preserving the breed of hares and partridges, for the exclusive use of the inde- pendent country gentlemen. In America we may reasonably hope that the people will never cease to regard the right of keeping and bearing arms as the surest pledge of their liberty.'37 Still, the British experience does not conclude the case against weapons control. The qualification statutes in essence functioned to arm a favored class as well as to disarm a potentially dissident one. The system divided society into two groups: a camp of armed bene- ficiaries of the established rule and a disarmed outer circle of those suspected to be dissidents.'38 Both existing and proposed weapons- control legislation in the United States respond to different consider- ations. Social forces rather than statutory design have arguably suc- ceeded in dividing American society into separate armed and dis- armed camps, though ironically the scheme may be the inverse of that the British lawmakers sought to create. Proponents of gun con- trol now seek not to further that division, but rather to achieve some parity within society through generally applicable restrictions. American law has also never sought to segregate wildlife for the taste of a privileged class of hunters. Both the inclination of 134.

As one court asked rhetorically, how could such a scheme "apply to a country which was but one extended forest, in which the liberty of killing a deer, or cutting down a tree, was as unrestrained as the natural rights of the deer to rove, or the tree to grow: and where was the aristocracy whose privileges were to be secured?"140 Indeed, without restrictive laws, the "artificial pre-eminence of Game"141 was so lacking from the American taste that it became necessary to compel sportsmen to retrieve some quarry rather than leave it to rot where it fell.142 However, contention about whether the law should protect the taste of a single group has not disappeared; it has simply changed form. The dispute over whether men should be allowed to kill other animals for pleasure threatens to produce a new qualification test: Each side includes those as eager to have their views alone prevail as were the sporting gentry intent to arrogate to themselves the sole right to game.143 Both hunters and protectors have affected the present govern- ment policies in the United States. Hunters have kept ninety per- cent of federal public lands open to their sport.l44 And their voices have had inordinate weight within state wildlife departments because those agencies have been funded through revenues derived from hunting and fishing.'45 On the other hand, those who condemn 139.

See Hearings on S. 2951, S. 3212 Before the Senate Comm. on Commerce, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, at 83 (1968) (statement of Dr. Alfred Etter): [F]ew game and fish agencies are making a determined effort to obtain broader public support. Hunting and fishing interests want to preserve the special posi- tion they acquire through payment of the lion's share of the costs through license fees. They are also afraid that if the entire public contributed to the support of wildlife activities the hunter's voice would often be drowned out by the per- centage of the population that does not hunt. 72 [Vol. 74:49</page><page sequence="25">British Wildlife Law hunting have secured both state and federal protection for species that only recently were not only hunted, but were subject to bounties."4 Protectors have also succeeded in excluding hunting from many national parks and wildlife reserves.147 Future legisla- tive development should consciously balance the interests of these two groups rather than accede to the demands of either. Moreover, the extremists of both sides might reassess their posi- tions. So malodorous a precedent are the qualification laws that those who would dedicate wildlife to a single interest ought to take stock of the current of history to which they belong. They should consider whether the relationship between humans and animals merits more concern than relationships between people. The con- flict between hunters and protectors benefits neither because it dissi- pates resources needed by both groups to marshal against other his- toric dangers. Destruction of wildlife habitat threatens the interests of both far more than do their internecine disputes.148 To meet this threat of irreversible harm to wildlife, each group needs the other's -support. L. Glasgow, former Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, has stated: The emphasis in the States has been on the bird, animal or fish which the license buyer can kill and take home. And you [state wildlife officials] have most hunters and fishermen in your corer. But you are losing the great ma- jority who neither hunt nor fish. They are anything but a silent majority. You had better do more to enlist them in your cause. (And before the Chair entertains a dozen requests from the floor, I want to hurry to add that I remember where money comes from in States for land purchase, research and management. And I have not forgotten for a minute whose payday is made possible through purchase of hunting and fishing licenses.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the following threatened predators among others have received various forms of protection: northern rocky mountain wolf (protected in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks); eastern timber wolf (having declined because of hunting and trapping pres- sure for bounties, this species is now protected in Michigan, and bounties have been reduced to only a localized basis in Minnesota); grizzly bear (complete protection in Washington, Colorado, and Idaho, as well as federal protection in national parks); and Florida panther (protected by law in Florida since 1966).

Such habitat alteration is usually even more destructive than [direct efforts to kill or capture wildlife] because in addition to being almost impossible to restore affected areas, all animal forms within the ecosystem are affected. Ecosystem alteration is, in fact, the principal cause of the loss of spe- cies.

The king's policy flowed from both his fervor as a hunter and his belief that he was responsible toward more than just his human subjects. Economic threats to wildlife can be sur- mounted by hunters and protectors only if they can join together in a comparable unity of purpose.</page></plain_text>
