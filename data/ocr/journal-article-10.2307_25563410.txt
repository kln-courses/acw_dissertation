It is no longer necessary that artists maintain a commercial link with galleries: artistic activity is decentralising to new spaces and the initiative of different not-for-profit organisations, and institutions are adopting more and more a risk-taking role. In Barcelona, a good part of the annual artistic activity of the city develops out of three cycles entrusted by three institutions to independent commissioners. The Fundacion Miro uses Espai 13 for the programming of six exhibitions dunng the year. The 1998-1999 period was in the hands of Jorge Luis Marzo, who is bringing to conclusion a cycle in which he presents works created using new technologies. The municipal government (Ayuntamiento) disposes over an enormous Romanesque chapel which is dedicated fundamentally to the promotion of artists who work in the city. Luisa Ortinez has taken on this year's four exhibitions with a cycle entitled Nueve Planetas. Finally, the La Caixa foundation has a small room in the Calle Montcada which acts as a forum favouring dialogue between national and international artists. The current cycle, A Distancia, is curated by Mart. Peran. During the months of April and May La Caixa's Sala Montcada is showing the work of Joana Cera, while Luisa Ortihez in La Capella has selected a group show with works by Luis Bisbe, Mart. Cormand and Julia Montilla. The current exhibition by Joana Cera is the culmination of a long process of work by this artist on darkness?darkness as a place in which to take refuge from the saturation of images and objects, a place in which it is possible to obtain a non-image, a kind of bare writing of the space which he gropes his way around. The result is five large-format photos realised through long exposure in the dark, during which the artist drew the space with a lantern; plus two fragile sculptures in glass, made of light transparent filaments which jut precariously from the wall, practically invisible, on the verge of disappearing, of the need to be verified by touch and the impossibility of doing so. But where Cera's work becomes truly strong is in its ability to evade dangers, to move like a tightrope-walker between opposites. Cera's photos and sculptures are full of a preciousness which seduces our look as it exposes our incapacity to fill their void. The scant seven pieces in the show fill the room through their strong auratic power; their weight as image and form, at the same time as they are silent and as they empty the space. The work of Cera functions at formal and conceptual limits where, starting from a questioning of representation in art a discussion opens on our ability to apprehend the world. Luis Bisbe exhibits two pieces in the Capella space. Curiously, his preoccupations are not much distant from Cera's, in that his work takes as its starting point reflection on the same inability to apprehend the world. In the immense and difficult empty nave of La Capella, Bisbe has mounted a drawing in space of an imposing diving board. It raises itself above our heads like a structure which is simultaneously false and real, realised with wires which only prefigure its drawing its three dimensional schema. The whole space is conditioned by the strange irreality of that piece, in which we appear deprived of co ordinates, of reality; like shipwrecked survivors in a swimming pool. At the other extreme of the space a slide is projected which gives the paradoxical impression that nothing is projected. Only by crossing the beam of light do we discover that that which appears on the wall is the same wall photographed. Bisbe underlines a reality which already exists. His work travels from a loss of co-ordinates in which we constantly founder to an attempt to subject and give coherence to a reality, a world which seems to him unsustainable, ungraspable. Bisbe has taken on as art's mission, and that of his own work, to remake and subjugate this world, albeit precariously. Martf Cormand exhibits in the two lateral chapels three large drawings made with charcoal directly onto the walls. In 24 iconos por segundo lightly anthropomorphic figures appear which show a Kafkaesque organism in transformation?three instants of decomposition of the human body, like film frames from a dissected ampler process. The fluorescent illumination of the rooms bestows an even greater irreality to the works, suggesting a sort of laboratory in which to witness a process of human metamorphosis. Finally, Julia Montilla, in the last of La Capella's side spaces, presents her latest work, the video Dynamic Tracking. A woman falls asleep on a sofe, in a white room, a non-place without spatial references, where time has stopped or slowed. The images superimpose themselves in an apparently incoherent manner, showing a space foreign to reality, which falls apart and flows. A place where the self dissolves.
