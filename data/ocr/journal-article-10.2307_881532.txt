<plain_text><page sequence="1">Diisseldorf Picasso Plastiken Picasso Plastiken (formerly at the Nationalgalerie, Berlin; at the Kunst- halle, Dusseldorf until 29th January) provides a welcome opportunity to see a remarkable group of works, the majority of which were until recently inaccessible. Werner Spies has succeeded in reas- sembling nearly all the major sculptures which Picasso kept for himself until his death. During his lifetime, these were shown only in 1966 in the Grand and Petit Palais exhibition, Hommage ai Picasso, and in 1967 in Picasso - sculpture, ceramics and drawings shown in London and New York. Only a selection re-emerged in 1979 at the Dation Picasso show in Paris (which was seen in part in London in 1981) and several more at the Picasso Retrospective in New York in 1980. Picasso Plastiken is thus the most representative sculpture show since the artist's death - inevitably a few pieces are missing (not- ably the 1930 Juan-les-Pins sand reliefs) owing to the restrictions which now limit the travel of works of art. Another merit of this exhibition is its clear chronological arrangement, which follows the catalogue compiled by Spies in collaboration with Christine Piot, enti- tled, Picasso - Das Plastische Werk.* In this, Spies has considerably expanded the text of his The Sculpture of Picasso [1971] and, by providing a considerable amount of new documentary and visual material, begins to elucidate the context of this part of Picasso's euvre. Its most interesting revelation is the very small number of casts Picasso made of his works - several bronzes are tirage unique. My only reservation about an otherwise superb chronology concerns the date 1907 attributed to Figure (S19), which has on its side the remains of a luggage label bearing the words Chemin de fer de l'Ouest - destination Paris, Saint Lazare - exp [edition] bagages. This suggests an associ- ation of the work with Picasso's summer sojourn at La Rue des Bois in 1908, from where he returned to Paris in the autumn of that year. Furthermore, considering the catalogue's monumental effort to bring together all extant and lost works, it is regrettable to find that it chose to omit any reference to the pair to Seated Woman, (S104). This figure, similar but assuming a different posture, is clearly visible in a Brassai photograph of Picasso's studio, published in the first issue of Minotaure in 1933, where both appear either side of a mantelpiece. Unlike its pair, it was never cast in bronze, but seems nevertherless to have survived well into the 'fifties, when it was photographed by David Douglas Duncan see The Private World of Pablo Picasso [1958], p.22). The display in Berlin, where the exhib- ition was first shown, was elegant and sober in its presentation of the sculptures and near perfect in its lighting condi- tions. For instance, Reclining Woman (S109) was cleverly set on a low base, and a plunging line of vision captured a unified impression of this sensual work, which appears ragged and disparate when seen at eye level. However, in hanging Mandoline and clarinet (S54; Fig.86) too high, Spies suppressed the clarity of its construction, obscuring its punning anthropomorphic content of male nudity. The careful and intelligent selection of works enables us to grasp certain features of Picasso's development as a sculptor. Thus the seeds of Femme au jardin (S72) are contained in the 1928 wire Construc- tions (S69) and the folded metal cubist works, of which the 1924 Guitar (S63) is a late yet representative example. What emerges from such comparisons is the extraordinary spontaneity Picasso was able to recover once he had fully worked out the possibilities of a particular tech- nique. They also seem to raise the issue of the nature of Picasso's sculpture in terms of their three dimensionality. Fas- cinating as Femme aujardin's spatial elab- oration may be, when seen from the back it remains tightly constructed but offers no compelling views. Even Man with a lamb (S280) cannot claim to be fully worked up in the round; an early study for the figure illustrated in the catalogue (p.206) indicates that a single plane framework governs this multi-axial figure and lies beneath its elaborate modelling. Seen from the back, the figure reveals how hastily it was brought to completion. However, it is fascinating to see that the ideas contained in that early sketch recur years later in the 1956 Cannes bathers (S503-508) also on show. In concentrating our attention on works which display a 'plastisch' or solid, three dimensional quality, Spies has justified the omission of supportive draw- ings and paintings, in order to establish the 'autonomy' of the sculptures them- selves. The inclusion of the cubist painted constructions makes this point clear, but their isolation within a purely plastic context tends to simplify their highly problematic nature by ignoring their intimate relationship with the two dimensional works. Picasso invested constructions such as Glass, pipe, ace of clubs and die (S45) with the dual role of an attempted solution to a two dimensional problem and an aut- onomous statement in three dimensions. These issues are taken even further in a series whose presence in the show marks a real coup on the part of Spies - the five (one remains untraced) versions of the Absinthe glass (S36), each one deco- rated differently. In the catalogue, he aptly points out the multi-layered imag- ery contained in these works (representa- tion - the modelled glass; reality - the spoon; and imitation - the sugar cube). Light is drawn into this intellectual exer- cise, as the polka dots not only pun on the actual highlights and reflections which a real glass would recieve in actual light, but also on those with which a sculptor would invest his forms through modelling. The exhibition shows how Picasso resolved these seemingly irreconcilable questions. His new approach to tradi- tional sculpture, with his intricate assemblage of found objects, is brought *Picasso - I)as Plastische Werk.

Finally Spies brings us full circle to Picasso's early inventions with the late pieces made of cut and folded sheet metal. Once again we experience the thrill of seeing in the same show the historic 1912 Guitar (S27), a superb minute gem of the 'twen- ties Guitar and table in front of a window (S61c) and the spectacular, effortless arabesques of the 1961 Seated monkey (S578).
