<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FATE OF ANCIENT GREEK NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE MIDDLE AGES: ISLAM AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY EDWARD GRANT JL HE ENDURING impact of ancient Greek science and natural philoso phy on the civilizations of Islam and Latin Christianity is one of the great success stories in the history of the world. The successful trans mission of Greek science into Arabic and then of Greek and Arabic science into Latin compels us to speak of "Greco-Islamic-Latin" sci ence in the Middle Ages. It was Greco-Islamic-Latin science and natu ral philosophy that unquestionably set the stage for the Scientific Rev olution of the seventeenth century, which would otherwise have been impossible. The transmittal of science and natural philosophy from Greek to Arabic and from Greek and Arabic to Latin was largely a one way process, a one-way belt of transmission. There was little, if any, backward movement?that is, there were no meaningful translations from Arabic to Greek and from Latin to Arabic and Greek?and there fore no significant interactions between Western Christianity and Is lam. But if there were no mutual interactions in science and natural philosophy between Latin Christianity and Islam, the two religions on which I shall focus, there were important contrasts in the way each re ligious tradition responded to, and utilized, the scientific heritage it re ceived. Perhaps the differences in their long-term responses to secu lar pagan philosophical and scientific learning were shaped to a lesser or greater extent by the culture and civilization in which each was born and the manner in which each came into being.

Christianity was born inside the Roman Empire and was spread slowly and quietly, but persistently. By comparison with Islam, Chris tianity was disseminated at a snail's pace. Not until 300 years after the birth of Christ was Christianity effectively represented throughout the Roman Empire. Only in 313, by the Edict of Milan, or Edict of Tol eration, was Christianity given full equality with other religions in the Empire. And it was not until 392?almost four centuries after the birth of Christ?that Christianity became the state religion, when the Emperor Theodosius ordered the closing of pagan temples and for bade pagan worship. In striking contrast, Islam was spread over an enormous geo graphical area in a remarkably short time. In less than one hundred years after the death of Muhammad in 632, Islam became the domi nant religion in a vast area stretching from the Straits of Gibraltar in the West to India in the East. Such a rapid spread could only have oc curred by conquest. Where Christianity spread slowly, by proselytiz ing, Islam came from outside the Roman world as an alien intruder, and although its converts were pagans and often former Christians, the mind set of the invaders was one which viewed Greek learning as alien, as is illustrated by the fact that Muslims distinguished two kinds of sciences: the Islamic sciences, based on the Koran and Islamic law and traditions, and the foreign sciences, or "pre-Islamic" sciences, which encompassed Greek science and natural philosophy. We might say that the slow spread of Christianity provided Christians an oppor tunity to adjust to Greek secular learning, whereas Islam's rapid dis semination made its relations with Greek learning much more prob lematic. Another dramatic difference concerns the relationship between church and state. From the outset, Christianity recognized the state as distinct from the church. The separation is encapsulated in these mo mentous words of Jesus: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matt. 22:21). Thus did Jesus acknowledge the state and implicitly urge his followers to be good citizens. Although Church and state were con tending powers throughout the Middle Ages, each acknowledged the independence of the other. They regarded themselves as two swords,</page><page sequence="3">ISLAM AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY 505 although, all too often, they were pointed at each other. Even when the church asserted supremacy over the state, however, it never at tempted to establish a theocracy by appointing bishops and priests who were also to function as secular rulers. The tradition of the Ro man state within which Christianity developed and the absence of ex plicit biblical support for a theocratic state were powerful constraints on unbridled and grandiose papal ambitions and, above all, made the imposition of a theocratic state implausible. In Islam church and state are one. Religion cannot be understood apart from politics, and vice versa.1 "The function of the state was to guarantee the well-being of the Muslim religion, so that all who lived within the state could be good, practicing Muslims."2 Where religion is strong, as it was in medieval Islam, it is likely to dominate secular activities, such as natural philosophy. To avoid this consequence, at least one of the following conditions would be essential: (1) regard natural philosophy as a discipline that is distinct and independent from theology; or (2) a secular state protects natural philosophy; or (3) religious authorities regard natural philosophy favorably. While we shall see that the first and third conditions were met in the Latin West, none of the three conditions was met in medieval Islam. A third significant difference between Islam and the medieval Christian West is organizational and structural. Islam has no overrid ing, central authority to determine its orthodoxy, whereas the Latin West had the papacy to insure adherence to the faith and to combat heresy. In brief, Islam is a kind of democratic religion that relies on consensus, whereas medieval Christendom was a centralized religion, headed by a single individual, the Pope, who, in principle, had su preme authority to determine and shape religious opinion and belief. From such a major structural difference, one might suppose that pa pal-dominated, centralized Christianity would have been far more re strictive and oppressive toward secular Greek learning than consen sus-seeking Islam. The record shows, however, that the Church was favorably disposed toward secular learning, especially Aristotelian natural philosophy. In Islam, however, Aristotelian natural philoso phy and the philosophers who studied it were often treated with 1 See Reynold A. Nicholson, A Literary History of the Arabs (Cam bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953), 182. 2 Edward Grant, The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 183.</page><page sequence="4">506 EDWARD GRANT hostility. As we shall see, it was in Islam, rather than in the Latin West, that secular learning, philosophy, and, the "foreign sciences" in general, were subject to significant constraints and confronted con siderable obstacles and prejudice. Although there are hadiths, or traditions, in Islam that praise the unending quest for knowledge, "implying the endlessness of knowl edge itself,"3 there are others that see a world that is steadily deterio rating. At least two hadiths express this attitude. In the first, the Prophet proclaims that "time has come full circle back to where it was on the day when first the heavens and the earth were created," and in the second he declares that "The best generation is my generation, then the ones who follow and then those who follow them."4 Both ha diths were often cited and commentaries were made upon them. "They suggest a universe running down, an imminent end to man and all his works."5 Such hadiths may have served as powerful elements in Islamic thought and custom. They may have encouraged those who sought to preserve the status quo, or who wished to turn the clock back as far as possible to create a society as close as possible to that which existed in the days of the Prophet Muhammad. It is plausible to suppose that such hadiths exerted an influence on attitudes toward Greek science and natural philosophy, the foreign sciences, which did not exist within Islam when it began. Indeed, the influence of such hadiths may have affected the way Islam responded to the invention of the printing press. Although it takes us beyond the Middle Ages, it is relevant to mention the time and manner in which printing was introduced into Islam. Although the printing press had been in use in the West since around 1460, and its virtues were obvious, it was not introduced into Islam until 1727,6 when Ibrahim M?teferrika, described as "a renegade from the Hungar 3 See Tarif Khalidi, "The Idea of Progress in Classical Islam," Journal of Near Eastern Studies 40 (Oct. 1981), 280. 4 A.J.

Even when introduced, the forces that had always opposed it exacted a price: only secular works could be printed, not sacred texts, including the Koran. In The Otto man Centuries, Lord Kinross declares that With the aid of a committee of twenty-five translators, he [M?teferrika] published a flow of works revealing to his adopted compatriots the mys teries of such objects of study as geography and cartography, in which he himself specialized; physics and astronomy, including a translation of Aristotle with information for the first time on the telescope and micro scope, on magnetism and the compass, on the theories of Galileo; on mathematics in its various branches, with the discussion of the ideas of Descartes; and finally on medicine.8 As an indication that the Ottoman government still did not realize the power of the printing press, M?teferrika's death in 1745 resulted in the cessation of printing until 1783, a hiatus of nearly 40 years.9 There are undoubtedly other significant differences between Is lam and Christianity, but we must now narrow our focus. Although Greek science and natural philosophy may have been regarded as for eign sciences in Islam, most of Greek science and natural philosophy were translated into Arabic and studied over the centuries. Scholars in the Islamic world made significant contributions to science and natu ral philosophy. Indeed, from around 1100 to 1500, sciences such as optics, astronomy, mechanics, mathematics, and medicine reached a higher state in Islam than in the medieval West. In what follows, how ever, I shall ignore the exact sciences, which posed no significant doc trinal problems for Islam or Christianity, and focus rather on natural philosophy, almost exclusively Aristotle's natural philosophy, which did indeed pose major problems for Islam and Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Aristotelian natural philosophy was in herently more important than any single identifiable exact science. In the broadest sense, natural philosophy was the study of change and motion in the physical world. It was one of Aristotle's three subdivi sions of theoretical knowledge, or knowledge for its own sake. As the very name suggests, the domain of natural philosophy was the whole of nature. It did not represent any single science, but could, and did, embrace bits and pieces of all sciences. In this sense, natural philoso 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid., 382. 9 Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">508 EDWARD GRANT phy was "The Mother of All Sciences." But medieval natural philoso phy was far more significant than is indicated by the mere fact that embedded within it were bits and pieces of different modern sciences. In a culture such as that of the Middle Ages, in which the tools for sci entific research and inquiry were largely absent, how could nature be interpreted and analyzed in order to arrive at some understanding of a world that would otherwise be unknowable and inexplicable? The most powerful weapon available was human reason, employed in the manner that Aristotle had used it. The idea was to come to know what things seemed to be?and this could be done by empirical means?and then to determine what made them that way, a process that was largely guided by metaphysical and apriori considerations. In the ancient and medieval worlds, Aristotle's works represented the apotheosis of reason. Without reason, science cannot exist. It is the first indispensable element in the development of science and it was the characteristic feature of medieval natural philosophy. For these reasons, a comparison of the status of natural philosophy in medieval Islam and in the Latin West should tell us much about the potentiality for science within each civilization, and therefore provide some in sight into a perennially perplexing question: why did Islam, which reached a higher state of scientific development in the Middle Ages than the Latin West, fail to continue its development, while the West, which started much later, surpassed Islam by 1600. One major result of any comparison between the relations of these two religions to Ar istotelian natural philosophy will reveal that, in contrast with the West, Aristotelian natural philosophy in Islam had an uneasy and un even existence. Let us see why. II Islam. Throughout the history of medieval Islam, the role of Greek philosophy was problematic. At any particular time, there were those who viewed it favorably, while others, undoubtedly a consider able majority, viewed it, at best, with indifference, and perhaps even with some degree of hostility. Occasionally the attitude of this or that caliph was instrumental in altering attitudes toward natural philoso phy, but more often attitudes toward natural philosophy and Greek thought were governed by Muslim religious leaders, who exercised great influence in particular regions or cities. Not only was Greek phi</page><page sequence="7">ISLAM AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY 509 losophy regarded as a foreign science, but the term philosopher (fay lasufs) was often employed pejoratively. In the intellectual hierarchy of medieval Islamic society, scholars distinguish three levels.10 Because Islam was a nomocracy, the first level was comprised of legal scholars. The religious law and traditions were valued above all else, and, therefore, valued even more than the ology. Next in order came the mutakallimun, scholars who used Greek philosophy to interpret and defend the Muslim religion. The mutakallimun emphasized rational discourse, to which they added the authority of revelation. And, finally, at the bottom, were the falasija, the Islamic philosophers, who followed rational Greek thought, espe cially the thought of Aristotle. Not surprisingly, the philosophers placed greatest reliance on reasoned argument while downplaying revelation. The philosophers sought to develop natural philosophy in an Islamic environment, and, as Abdelhamid I. Sabra has put it, did so, "often in the face of suspicion and opposition from certain quarters in Islamic society."11 Of the three Islamic groups just distinguished, namely legal schol ars, who were almost always traditionalists, the mutakallimun, and philosophers, the traditionalists made no real use of Greek philoso phy, largely because they found it a threat to revealed truth and the Is lamic faith. In their bitter struggle with each other and with the tradi tionalists, the mutakallimun and the philosophers made much use of Greek philosophy. The mutakallimun were primarily concerned with the Kalam, which, according to Sabra, is "an inquiry into God, and into the world as God's creation, and into man as the special creature placed by God in the world under obligation to his creator."12 Thus Kalam is a theology that used Greek philosophical ideas to explicate and defend the Islamic faith. Two groups of mutakallimun have been identified: the Mu'tazi lites, who were the more extreme, and the Ash'arites.13 Both groups shared an attitude "against the passive acceptance of authority in mat ters of faith." It was their intention to replace the "passive acceptance 10 Toby Huff, The Rise of Early Modern Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 69. 11 Abdelhamid I.

In the ninth century, the Mu'tazilites gained the support of caliphs like al Mamun and Mutassim, as well as influential intellectuals. The sup portive caliphs persecuted those who opposed the Mu'tazilite belief that the Koran was created. They implemented a virtual inquisition. Because many thought their rationalism was extreme, the Mu'tazilites were regarded as heretics by many Sunni Muslims.17 Their ascen dancy ended with the rule of the Sunni caliph al-Mutawakkil, who de stroyed their movement.18 The Asharites, who followed the teaching of al-Ash'ari (d. 935), are the second group of mutakallimun. They broke with Mu'tazilism and replaced it as the main representatives of kalam. Ash'arism, how ever, was a complicated movement, with some of its followers empha sizing rationalism, while others argued in the traditionalist mode.19 Although the mutakallimun, both Mutazilites and Asharites, were se vere critics of the philosophers, they were, in turn, themselves re garded as too rational and were bitterly opposed by more conserva tive Muslims, both from the Sunni and Shiite sides. In treating of attitudes toward natural philosophy and science in medieval Islam, it is essential to have a good sense of the relation ships between Muslim traditionalism and Muslim rationalism, which were engaged in an ongoing, and bitter, struggle about the role of Is 14 Sabra, "Science and Philosophy in Medieval Islamic Theology," 9. 15 Toby Huff, The Rise of Early Modern Science,, 111. 16 William Montgomery Watt, Islamic Philosophy and Theology: An Ex tended Survey (Edinburgh: University Press, 1985), 54. 17 Ibid., 55. 18 See Pervez Hoodbhoy, Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality (London: Zed Books Ltd, 1991), 99-100. 19 For a good account, see George Makdisi, "Ash'ari and the Ash'arites in Islamic Religious History," Parts I and II, in Studia Isl?mica, vol. 17 (1962), 37-80; and vol. 18 (1963), 19-39. Reprinted in George Makdisi, Religion, Law and Learning in Classical Islam (Hampshire, Great Britain: Variorum Collected Studies Series; Brookfield, Vermont: Gower Publishing Co., 1991), I.</page><page sequence="9">ISLAM AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY 511 lam in intellectual life. George Makdisi provides a useful way to dis tinguish between Muslim traditionalism and Muslim rationalism by ex plaining that: The traditionalists made use of reason in order to understand what they considered as the legitimate sources of theology: scripture and tradi tion. What they could not understand they left as it stood in the sources; they did not make use of reason to interpret the sources metaphorically. On the other hand, the rationalists advocated the use of reason on scrip ture and tradition; and all that they deemed to contradict the dictates of reason they interpreted metaphorically in order to bring it into harmony with reason.20 The antithetical approaches of the Muslim traditionalists and the Muslim rationalists can be illustrated directly from the mutakallimun themselves, namely from the Mutazilites and Asharites. What was one to make of anthropomorphic statements in the Koran that speak of "the face of Allah, His eyes and hands, His sitting on His throne, and His being seen by the Faithful in Paradise."21 The strong tendency in Islam was to take such statements literally. Thus al-Ash'ari himself, for whom reason in theology was still important, declared that: We confess that God is firmly seated on His throne. ... We confess that God has two hands, without asking how. . . . We confess that God has two eyes, without asking how.... We confess that God has a face... .22 Mutazilites, however, viewed these same statements metaphori cally. God has no bodily parts; He has no parts or divisions; He is not finite. They also say that "He cannot be described by any description which can be applied to creatures, in so far as they are created... The senses do not reach Him, nor can man describe Him by analogy. . . . Eyes do not see Him, sight does not reach Him, phantasy cannot con ceive Him nor can He be heard by ears."23 I am unaware of any analo gous discussion in the Christian West during the Middle Ages. Medi eval Latin theologians regarded anthropomorphic descriptions of God as metaphorical pronouncements. 20 George Makdisi, "Ash'ari and the Ash'arites in Islamic Religious His tory," Part II, in Studia Isl?mica, vol. 18 (1963), 22.

Of the three groups distinguished earlier, the least popular were the philosophers, whom the mutakallimun and conservative Muslims attacked because they used natural philosophy and logic to acquire truth for its own sake, which usually signified that they were ignoring religion. One of the most significant Ash'arite thinkers, the famous al-Ghazali (1058-1111), leveled a devastating at tack against philosophy. He was fearful of the detrimental effects on the Islamic religion of subjects like natural philosophy, theology (ac tually metaphysics), logic, and mathematics. In his famous quasi-au tobiographical treatise, Deliverance from Error, he explained that re ligion does not require the rejection of natural philosophy, but that there are serious objections to it because nature is completely subject to God, and no part of it can act from its own essence. The implica tion is obvious: Aristotelian natural philosophy is unacceptable be cause it assumes that natural objects can act by virtue of their own es sences and natures. That is, Aristotle believed in secondary causation?that physical objects are capable of causing effects in other physical objects. Al-Ghazali found mathematics dangerous be cause it uses clear demonstrations, thus leading the innocent to think that all the philosophical sciences are equally lucid. A man will say to himself, al-Ghazali related, "if religion were true, it would not have es caped the notice of these men [that is, the mathematicians] since they are so precise in this science."24 Ghazali explains further that such a man will be so impressed with what he hears about the techniques and demonstrations of the mathematicians that "he draws the conclu sion that the truth is the denial and rejection of religion. How many have I seen," al-Ghazali continues, "who err from the truth because of this high opinion of the philosophers and without any other basis."25 Although al-Ghazali allowed that the subject matter of mathematics is not directly relevant to religion, he included the mathematical sci ences within the class of philosophical sciences (these are: mathemat ics, logic, natural science, theology or metaphysics, politics, and eth ics) and concluded that a student who studied these sciences would be "infected with the evil and corruption of the philosophers. Few 24 Translated in William Montgomery Watt, The Faith and Practice of al-Ghazali (London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd, 1953), 33. 25 Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">ISLAM AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY 513 there are who devote themselves to this study without being stripped of religion and having the bridle of godly fear removed from their heads."26 In his great philosophical work, The Incoherence of the Philoso phers, al-Ghazali attacked ancient philosophy, especially the views of Aristotle. He did this by describing and criticizing the ideas of al Farabi and Avicenna, two of the most important Islamic philosophical commentators on Aristotle. After criticizing their opinions on twenty philosophical problems, including the eternality of the world, that God knows only universals and not particulars, and that bodies will not be resurrected after death, al-Ghazali declares: All these three theories are in violent opposition to Islam. To believe in them is to accuse the prophets of falsehood, and to consider their teach ings as a hypocritical misrepresentation designed to appeal to the masses. And this is blatant blasphemy to which no Muslim sect would subscribe.27 Al-Ghazali regarded theology and natural philosophy as danger ous to the faith. He had an abiding distrust of philosophers and praised the "unsophisticated masses of men," who "have an instinctive aversion to following the example of misguided genius." Indeed, "their simplicity is nearer to salvation than sterile genius can be."28 As one of the greatest and most respected thinkers in the history of Islam, al-Ghazali's opinions were not taken lightly. In light of al-Ghazali's attack on the philosophers, it is not surpris ing to learn that philosophers were often subject to persecution by re ligious leaders. Many religious scholars regarded philosophy, logic and the foreign Greek sciences generally, as useless, and even un godly, because they were not directly useful to religion. Indeed, they might even make one disrespectful of religion.29 In the thirteenth cen tury, Ibn as-Salah ash-Shahrazuri (d. 1245), a religious leader in the field of tradition (hadith), declared in afatwa that "He who studies or teaches philosophy will be abandoned by God's favor, and Satan will overpower him. What field of learning could be more despicable than 26Ibid., 34. 27 Cf. Al-Ghazali's Tahafut al-Falasifah [Incoherence of the Philoso phers}, trans.

Now the means of access to something bad is also bad."31 Ibn as-Salah was not content to confine his hostility to words alone. In a rather chilling passage, he urges vigorous action against students and teach ers of philosophy and logic, because: Those who think they can occupy themselves with philosophy and logic merely out of personal interest or through belief in its usefulness are be trayed and duped by Satan. It is the duty of the civil authorities to pro tect Muslims against the evil that such people can cause. Persons of this sort must be removed from the schools and punished for their culti vation of these fields. All those who give evidence of pursuing the teachings of philosophy must be confronted with the following alterna tives: either (execution) by the sword or (conversion to) Islam, so that the land may be protected and the traces of those people and their sci ences may be eradicated. May God support and expedite it. However, the most important concern at the moment is to identify all of those who pursue philosophy, those who have written about it, have taught it, and to remove them from their positions insofar as they are employed as teachers in schools.32 Although numerous others shared the attitude of Ibn as-Salah, logic continued to be used as an ancillary subject in scholastic theol ogy (Kalam) and in many orthodox religious schools. But there was enough hostility toward philosophy and logic in Islam to prompt phi losophers to keep a low profile. Those who taught did so privately to students who might have sought them out. Following the translations in the early centuries of Islam, Greek philosophy, primarily Aristotle's, received its strongest support from a number of individuals scattered about the Islamic world. Numbered among the greatest of Islamic nat ural philosophers are al-Kindi (801-873); Al-Razi (ca. 854-925 or 935); Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980-1037); and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126 1198). All were persecuted to some extent. Al-Kindi's case reveals important aspects of intellectual life in Is lam. The first of the Islamic commentators on Aristotle, al-Kindi was at first favorably received by two caliphs (al-Mamun and al-Mu 30Ignaz Goldziher, "The Attitude of Orthodox Islam Toward the 'Ancient Sciences,'" Studies on Islam, ed. and trans.

Swartz (New York: Ox ford University Press, 1981), 205. 31 Ibid. 32Ibid., 206.</page><page sequence="13">ISLAM AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY 515 tassim), but his luck ran out with al-Mutawakkil, the Sunni caliph mentioned earlier. According to Pervez Hoodbhoy, It was not hard for the ulema to convince the ruler that the philosopher had very dangerous beliefs. Mutawakkil soon ordered the confiscation of the scholar's personal library.... But that was not enough. The sixty year old Muslim philosopher also received fifty lashes before a large crowd which had assembled. Observers who recorded the event say the crowd roared approval with each stroke.33 The other four scholars were also subjected to some degree of perse cution and a number of them had to flee for their safety. Persecutions and harassment of those who advocated the use of reason to explicate revelation are unknown in the medieval Latin West after the mid-twelfth century, when Bernard of Clairvaux and other traditional theologians opposed the application of reason to theology. Bernard undoubtedly had much in common with Islamic traditionalist theologians. In his relentless assault on Peter Abelard, Bernard was convinced that Abelard's heresies, as he saw them, were the result of an excessive reliance on reason, as he makes clear in a letter to a Car dinal of the Church. "He has defiled the Church," Bernard declares, [H]e has infected with his own blight the minds of simple people. He tries to explore with his reason what the devout mind grasps at once with a vigorous faith. Faith believes, it does not dispute. But this man, apparently holding God suspect, will not believe anything until he has first examined it with his reason.34 Bernard's hostile attitude lingered on into the first forty years of the thirteenth century, but only at the University of Paris (though not at Oxford), where Church authorities first banned the books of Aristo tle from public or private use, then sought unsuccessfully to censor them. By the 1240's, however, Aristotle's books of natural philosophy were taught and read at the University of Paris. Indeed, they had be come the core of the curriculum in the arts faculty of that great medi eval university.35 After the 1240's, and for the rest of the Middle Ages, attacks on reason would have been regarded as bizarre and 33 See Pervez Hoodbhoy, Islam and Science^ 111. 34 Bernard of Clairvaux, The Life and Letters of St. Bernard of Clair vaux, trans. Bruno Scott James (London: Burns Oates, 1953), letter 249, p. 328. 35 For a brief account of the reaction to Aristotle's works at the Univer sity of Paris, see Grant, The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages, 70-80.</page><page sequence="14">516 EDWARD GRANT unacceptable. Some theologians were opposed to certain of Aristo tle's ideas, but, like St. Bonaventure, they used Aristotelian natural philosophy, and fully recognized that they could not do theology with out it. Scholars were sometimes accused of heresy, and occasionally the Church tried to curb the excessive use of logic and natural philos ophy in theological treatises, but I know of no instance where reli gious authorities sought to prevent the study of natural philosophy be cause it threatened religion. Indeed, as time passed, Aristotelian natural philosophy only became more entrenched in the medieval uni versities. By the time of the Galileo affair in the seventeenth century, the Church went to great lengths to defend and protect Aristotle's nat ural philosophy. How different it was in Islam, if we judge by a question that Aver roes posed in the twelfth century in his treatise On The Harmony of Religion and Philosophy. In this treatise, Averroes seeks to deter mine "whether the study of philosophy and logic is allowed by the [Is lamic] Law, or prohibited, or commanded?either by way of recom mendation or as obligatory."36 In the thirteenth century, Ibn as-Salah ash-Shahrazuri, an expert on the tradition of Islam and whom we have already met, issued a written reply (fatwd) to a question which asked, in Ignaz Goldziher's words, whether, from the point of view of religious law, it was permissible to study or teach philosophy and logic and further, whether it was permis sible to employ the terminology of logic in the elaboration of religious law, and whether political authorities ought to move against a public teacher who used his position to discourse on philosophy and write about it.37 What is remarkable in all this is the fact that in the twelfth cen tury, Averroes, and in the thirteenth century, Ibn as-Salah, were grap pling with the question whether, from the standpoint of the religious law, it was legitimate to study science, logic, and natural philosophy, even though these disciplines had been readily available in Islam since the ninth century. Averroes felt compelled to justify their study, 36 Averroes, On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy, A transla tion with introduction and notes, of Ibn Rushd's Kitabfasl al-maqal, with its appendix (Damima) and an extract from Kitab al-kashf 'an manahij al-adilla, trans.

Despite the enormous ob stacles faced by Islamic natural philosophers and scientists, either in the form of active harassment and even persecution, or simply as in difference, the remarkable feature about medieval Islamic science and natural philosophy was the high level they attained. As I have already mentioned the level of achievement in the sciences between 1100 and 1500 was higher in Islam than in the Christian West. It is more difficult to compare natural philosophy, partly because the Latin West derived some of its ideas from Islamic treatises. In the exploration of Aristo tle's works and in the departures they made from Aristotle's thought, the West may have advanced beyond Muslim scholars. But in other ways, certain Muslim scholars went beyond anything contemplated in the West. This is especially true in the attitudes of some Islamic natu ral philosophers toward theologians and religion. For example, al-Razi (ca. 854-925 or 935), known as Rhazes in the West, was a famous physician whose major medical work was trans lated into Latin. He actually attacked religion, denying miracles attrib uted to the prophets of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity (he is said to have written a treatise titled The Tricks of the Prophets). He refused to accept authority in either religion or science and believed that the sciences continually progressed because scientists build upon the knowledge they inherit from their predecessors. He accepted an atomic theory of matter akin to that of Democritus. Because of his in dependent views, al-Razi was severely criticized by his successors and many of his works have disappeared.38 Avicenna thought, in the words of Shlomo Pines, that al-Razi "should have confined himself to 38 My information about al-Razi is drawn from the article "Al-Razi, Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Zakariya" by Shlomo Pines in the Dictionary of Scien tific Biography (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1970-90), vol. 11, 323-6.</page><page sequence="16">518 EDWARD GRANT dealing with boils, urine, and excrement and should not have dabbled in matters beyond the range of his capacity."39 Averroes (Ibn Rushd) wrote famous commentaries on Aristotle, which are known only in Latin or Hebrew translations. He is unusual because in his treatise On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy, he insisted that only the philosophers are competent to judge Scrip ture, because they use demonstrative arguments. By contrast, the mutakallimun are incompetent to do so because they use dialectical reasoning based on popularly accepted premises.40 The kind of hostil ity that al-Razi and Averroes showed to the theologians, as well as al Razi's attacks on religion, have no counterparts in the medieval West. By contrast, Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) was more like al-Ghazali and defended religion against philosophy and logic. But his great fame does not derive from any defense of religion against the foreign sciences. Rather, it derives from his extraordinary treatise, known as the Muqaddima ("The Introduction"), which consisted of the intro duction and first book of a lengthy world history. According to Franz Rosenthal, "The Muqaddima was indeed the first large-scale attempt to analyze the group relationships that govern human political and so cial organization on the basis of environmental and psychological fac tors."41 Arnold Toynbee spoke in superlative terms about Ibn Khal dun, declaring that in his Muqaddima "he has conceived and formulated a philosophy of history which is undoubtedly the greatest work of its kind that has ever yet been created by any mind in any time or place."42 George Sarton's assessment is more critical, but nonetheless highly laudatory. Sarton did not rate Ibn Khaldun as a great historian, but regarded him as: the greatest theorician of history, the greatest philosopher of man's ex perience, not only of the Middle Ages, but of the whole period extending 39 Ibid., 326. 40 Averroes, On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy, 24. 41 Franz Rosenthal, "Ibn Khaldun," in Dictionary of Scientific Biogra phy, vol. 7 (1973), 321. 42 Toynbee's assessment of Ibn Khaldun is cited in An Arab Philosophy of History: Selections from the Prolegomena of Ibn Khaldun of Tunis (1332-1406), trans, and ed.

Badly composed as the Muqaddama is, with many repetitions, and poorly written sometimes to the point of obscurity, it remains one of the noblest and most impressive monuments of medieval thought. A comparison between Ibn Khaldun and Machiavelli is not to the disadvantage of the earlier writer.43 Although comparisons are difficult, there is no reason to believe that Islamic natural philosophers were inferior to those in the Latin West in the late Middle Ages. But the fate of natural philosophy in Is lam differed radically from that in the West. To gain a proper sense of the difference, we must compare the madrasas in Islam with the uni versities in the West. A madrasa was a charitable trust, which was es tablished freely by an individual Muslim, known as a waqif who en dowed the trust with substantial funds to be used for a public purpose. The founder had great latitude in determining the conditions for the operation of the madrasa he had founded with his own property. "The legal status of the madrasa allowed the founder to retain com plete control over the administrative and instructional staff of the in stitution."44 But the founder of a madrasa had to accept one condi tion: the terms of the foundation could not violate the tenets of Islam.45 The madrasa was essentially a school for the study of the reli gious sciences and subordinate and related subjects. Excluded from its curriculum were the "foreign sciences," that is the philosophical and natural sciences.46 Those who wished to study natural philosophy or the sciences for their own sakes had to either teach themselves, or make arrangements for private instruction with someone knowledge able in such matters.47 Occasionally nonreligious courses were taught in the madrasas on an optional basis. In his splendid book, The Man tle of the Prophet, Roy Mottahedeh explains that 43 George Sarton, Introduction to the History of Science (Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins Company, 1927-1948), vol. 3,1775. 44 Article "Madrasa" in Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. 5, 1128, col. 2. 45 See George Makdisi, The Rise of Colleges: Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1981), 36. 46 Ibid., 77. 47Ibid., 78.</page><page sequence="18">520 EDWARD GRANT Madreseh learning had formerly been a conspectus of higher learning, with its optional courses in Ptolemaic astronomy, Avicennian medicine, and the algebra of Omar Khayyam. But... even the mullahs recognized that their learning really was 'religious' learning, and only a few enthusiasts studied the traditional nonreligious sciences such as the old astronomy in private.48 However, those subjects were only taught which illuminated the Ko ran or the religious law. One such subject was logic, which was found useful in semantics and in avoiding "simple errors of inference," al though philosophical logic, popular in the West, was usually avoided.49 The primary function of the madrasa, however, was "to preserve learning and defend orthodoxy."50 In Iran, the madrasas ex isted into the twentieth century, limping on until the end of World War II. V The Medieval University in the Latin West. Apart from a few works of Aristotle's logic, the Christian West had virtually no knowl edge of Aristotle's natural philosophy for approximately 1100 years af ter the birth of Christianity. It was not until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that it made the bulk of Greek natural philosophy and sci ence a part of its intellectual heritage. Islam began its serious appro priation of Greek science in less than two centuries after its founding and by 1000 had translated into Arabic virtually all that it would re ceive. But if the West took approximately 1100 years to receive Aristo tle's natural philosophy, where Islam acquired it in only two to three hundred years, the West wasted no time in making the most of what it received. By 1200, the new translations facilitated the transition from the Cathedral school system to the university system, represented ini 48 Cf.

Despite some difficulties at the University of Paris, the new universities, and numer ous others that would follow in the course of the next three centu ries?approximately 75 existed by 1500?unhesitatingly chose Aristo tle's logic and natural philosophy to form the curriculum of their arts faculties. In a complete university, we find four faculties: arts, theol ogy, medicine, and law. All students were required to obtain a bache lor's degree in arts. If they wished to enter one of the three higher fac ulties of theology, medicine, and law, they were expected to obtain the Master of Arts degree. This meant that virtually all, if not all, theolo gians, physicians, and lawyers had been thoroughly trained in logic and natural philosophy, as were those who were content to acquire only a master of arts degree and therefore did not enter one of the three higher faculties. A university education in the Middle Ages was in no way intended to teach religion or theology. Theology was only taught in theology faculties to theology students. It was a jealously guarded intellectual preserve.51 Because all theologians were thoroughly trained in logic and Aris totle's natural philosophy, they used these subjects extensively in their theological commentaries, which all theological students were expected to produce. They posed questions that were answerable only by the application of logic and natural philosophy. One of the most powerful logical tools theologians used was the law of noncon tradiction where it was assumed that not even God could perform a contradiction. Richard of Middleton, for example, asks "whether God could do contradictory things simultaneously,"52 and concludes that He cannot. Theologians incessantly inquired whether God could per form this or that act. Their object was to determine whether God could or could not do something by applying the law of noncontradic 51 For a brief description of the medieval university and its faculties and curriculum, see Grant, The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages, ch. 3 ("The Medieval University"), 33-53.

If no contradiction was involved, God could perform the act; if there was a contradiction He could not. For example, Hugolin of Or vieto, in the fourteenth century, applied the law of noncontradiction to determine "Whether God could make the future not to be?"53 and "Whether God could make a creature exist for only an instant?"54 and Gregory of Rimini applied it to a question in which he inquired whether God could make someone sin.55 During the Latin Middle Ages theology became an analytical dis cipline with a heavy emphasis on logic and natural philosophy. In deed, to the extent that medieval theologians increased the analytic content of their theological treatises, they seem simultaneously to have diminished their spiritual content. Medieval theological com mentaries became exercises in natural philosophy and logic. From time to time Church authorities sought to stem the tide by edicts that were intended to curtail, if not prevent, excessive reliance of theology on natural philosophy and logic.56 Their efforts were in vain. Theol ogy had become too dependent on logic and natural philosophy. During the history of medieval Islam, a continual struggle raged among theologians, philosophers, and religious teachers. Only reli gious subjects constituted the curriculum of the madrasas, while the foreign sciences?logic, natural philosophy, and the exact sciences? were either ignored or taught only as ancillary subjects to shed light on religion. The university system in the Christian West was radically different. Universities taught a nonreligious analytic curriculum based on logic, science, and natural philosophy. So great was the surge toward analyticity, that theology was transformed into a large collection of problems that could only be resolved by the use of logic 53 Hugolini de Urbe Veteri OESA Commentarius in Quattuor Libros Sententiarum, edited by Willigis Eckermann O.

This practice continued routinely for four centuries and laid the basis for a rationalistic society. Islam and the West differed not because one civilization taught, studied, and wrote about analytic subjects that the other ignored. Both civilizations taught, studied, and wrote about logic, natural phi losophy, and the sciences. But in contrast with Islam, the West taught, studied, and wrote about these disciplines in universities that fully supported them. This was possible because the university curriculum was enthusiastically approved by church and state. Anyone with a university education had studied, and perhaps even commented on, Aristotle's natural philosophy and done so for its own sake, not for the sake of better understanding or explicating Scripture. In Islam, the foreign sciences, which comprised the analytic subjects derived ulti mately from the Greeks, were rarely taught in religious schools such as the madrasas, which formed the core of Islamic higher education. The analytic subjects were there, though they were marginal. But why were they marginal? Why did they not have equal status with religious and theological subjects? Why did they have to be taught as ancillary subjects, or taught privately and unobtrusively? We have now come full circle, since the answer to these questions requires reiteration of all the arguments and quotations that I have already presented. In light of the obstacles faced by natural philosophy in Islam, the high level of achievement that it attained is quite remarkable. But as long as religious traditionalists opposed or ignored analytic studies, they could not attain the required degree of acceptance to be a potent intel lectual force in Islamic society. I should like to conclude with a hypothetical scenario. Let us as sume that a reassessment of the traditional interpretation of the ma drasas should reveal that Islamic society did embrace analytic stud ies. What if it were shown that the madrasas laid heavy emphasis on rational subjects such as Aristotelian logic, natural philosophy, mathe matics, and astronomy. And let us suppose that this rationalistic cur riculum has been extremely stable since 1300, a period of seven hun dred years! And like the West these rationalistic subjects had as one of their functions the explication of Islamic revelation. In effect, let us assume that Islam's educational system in the madrasas was as ratio nalistic as that which prevailed in the medieval Latin West. If this should prove to be an accurate characterization of Islamic education since 1300, certain fundamental questions arise. Why did Islamic education remain so static for seven centuries, while in the</page><page sequence="22">524 EDWARD GRANT West, the analogous curriculum, based on medieval Aristotelian learn ing, was largely abandoned in the seventeenth century, after approxi mately four centuries, to be replaced by a new approach to science that is associated with the Scientific Revolution? With the implementation of the new science in the West, why did Islamic schol ars not appropriate what they could from the new science? Why did they continue on for centuries with an outmoded curriculum that had been abandoned in the West? Why did Islam not borrow the new sci ence and learning from the West during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, just as the West had borrowed much of their science and natural philosophy from Islam in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries? Were Muslims too proud to borrow from the West? Were they fearful that Western ideas would endanger the faith? Were they simply unin terested? Or did they regard it as unimportant and perhaps even irrel evant? Did they regard the new science as adding little or nothing to the science they already had in the madrasas and beyond, and per haps even viewed Western science as a step backward from that stan dard? This last possibility would make the hypothesis of a rationalistic curriculum in the madrasas seem far-fetched and implausible. And yet Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr is convinced that Islamic science is so radically different from Western science that it could not have profited from it. As Professor Nasr sees it, Islamic science was as im portant for religious and spiritual life, as it was for the acquisition of knowledge about the physical world. Islamic cosmol?gica! sciences not only provided "the necessary background and knowledge for par ticular disciplines of practical import such as medicine and agricul ture," but they had "a direct practical effect upon the inner life of man," because they are directly related to man's real existential problem which is to traverse the perilous caves and valleys of the 'mountains' of the physical and psychic worlds to reach safely the sky of the world of the Spirit.57 Continuing in the same vein, Professor Nasr explains that: The traditional cosmological sciences . . . concern man in an ultimate sense and on a level not to be compared with the modern sciences. The traditional cosmologies are related to man's inner perfection and to his ultimate end. They are inseparable from angelology and eschatology. They provide the background for that process of spiritual maturing 57 Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Science: An Illustrated Study (Wester ham, Kent, England: World of Islam Festival Publishing Co. Ltd., 1976), 236.</page><page sequence="23">ISLAM AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY 525 which enables man to become God's vice-regent in actuality rather than only potentially ...58 For Seyyed Hossein Nasr science and religion merge, and even fuse, to form a vast spiritual enterprise. If his characterization of Islamic sci ence is reasonably accurate, we might conclude that Muslims, satis fied with their own science, would have had no desire, and indeed, no need, to import Western science. Professor Nasr seems to regard Is lamic science as the product of a more holistic approach, in contrast to the narrower, more focused science produced in the West. A recent investigation into cultural differences may offer some support to those who would distinguish between Western and Islamic science along cultural lines. Dr. Richard Nesbitt, a social psychologist at the University of Michigan, and his colleagues challenge the widely held view among Western philosophers and psychologists that "the same basic processes underlie all human thought, whether in the mountains of Tibet or the grasslands of the Serengeti."59 The basic processes that all humans followed were alleged to embrace a devotion to logical reasoning, a penchant for categorization and an urge to understand situations and events in linear terms of cause and ef fect. However, in comparing East Asians and European Americans, Dr. Nesbitt and his colleagues arrived at a radically different assessment. They "found that people who grow up in different cultures do not just think about different things: they think differently." Easterners, they discovered, appear to think more "holistically," paying greater attention to context and relationship, relying more on experience-based knowledge than ab stract logic and showing more tolerance for contradiction. Westerners 58 Ibid., 237. Professor Nasr also believes that modern science, that is Western science, has led to the destruction of nature. By contrast, "... Is lamic metaphysics and cosmology were able to create an extensive science of the physical and of the psychic worlds which far from destroying nature only accented the equilibrium that exists in the cosmic order and emphasized the harmony between man and his environment. While the Islamic sciences taught man a great deal about the world about him and enabled man to rule over this world, they also set limits to his power to destroy the earth and pointed in a thousand ways to the fact that man's end is to journey to a world beyond and not to be satisfied through pride or ignorance with imprisonment within the cosmic crypt which man's forgetfulness has made to appear as his natural state" (Ibid., 239). 59 Erica Goode, "How Culture Molds Habits of Thought," Science Times, New York Times, August 8, 2000.

This is an intriguing analysis and is compatible with Professor Nasr's understanding of Islamic science and certainly fits what we know about Western analyticity. But it would require a great deal more investigation and discussion of medieval Islamic and Western natural philosophy and theology before we can assert with any confi dence that the differences between them derive from cultural differ ences between East and West of the kind described by Dr. Nesbitt and his colleagues. In light of all these uncertainties, it seems proper to conclude that we are as yet unable to answer the most vital questions about the course of science in Islam. Was it the kind of science Professor Nasr has described: as much concerned with the spiritual world as with the physical world; or was it more akin to medieval Western science and natural philosophy, and therefore incorporating a strong current of ra tionalistic thought? If the latter, why did Islam ignore Western sci ence for so long? Answers to such questions would contribute might ily toward a proper understanding of Islamic attitudes toward science and natural philosophy from the Middle Ages to the present.
