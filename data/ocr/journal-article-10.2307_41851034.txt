<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Soldier and His Suitcase: Karl Rossmann's Arrival in and Deliverance from Kafka's Amerika Charles H. Hammond, Jr. University of Tennessee at Martin Abstract: The metaphor of the suitcase and the motif of the soldier play critical, mutually reinforcing roles in Franz Kafka's first novel fragment Der Verschollene. The suitcase that the protagonist receives from his father as he departs for America represents the father' s legacy. Similarly, the motif of the soldier symbolizes idealized masculinity. These two elements intersect when Karl reveals that his suitcase is the same one his father brought with him when he joined the military. Ultimately, Karl is both unable to maintain possession of the suitcase and to realize his initial dream of becoming a soldier. In his Brief an den Vater [Letter to his Father ], Franz Kafka attempts to describe the conditional nature of his father's approval through the use of military imagery: "Ich hätte ein wenig Aufmunterung, ein wenig Freundlichkeit, ein wenig Offenhalten meines Wegs gebraucht, statt dessen verstelltest Du mir ihn, in der guten Absicht freilich, daß ich einen anderen Weg gehen sollte. Aber dazu taugte ich nicht. Du muntertest mich zum Beispiel auf, wenn ich gut salutierte und marschierte, aber ich war kein künftiger Soldat" [I could, have used a bit of encouragement, a bit of friendliness, you could have kept my path open, but instead you blocked it, with the well-meaning intent, of course, that I should follow another path. But I was unfit for it, you encouraged me, for example, when I saluted and marched well, but I zoas no future soldier] (Kafka, Zur Frage 15).1 Hermann Kafka had, of course, completed the compulsory military service that was required of all able-bodied males in Austro-Hungary as a condition of citizenship.2 However, the elder Kafka, who paid for Franz to attend the Gymnasium and study law at the university, certainly did not intend for his son to pursue a career in the army. The reference to the soldier in the Brief an den Vater, therefore, can be read as a metaphor for paternal recognition, as will be seen. To be sure, neither Kafka's diaries, nor his correspondence nor any other non-fictional works (such as the travel narratives) contain any explicit discussion of soldiery as a metaphor for the attainment of paternal recognition.3 Instead, as I seek to demonstrate, the symbolic significance of the soldier is elaborately addressed in Kafka's first novel, Amerika,4 where the soldier-motif stands for an impossible goal which the protagonist, an outcast son, nonetheless strives to achieve: namely, recognition by his father.5 52</page><page sequence="2">A Soldier and His Suitcase 53 In order to appreciate the significance of the soldier motif as a metaphor for paternal recognition, I argue that it is necessary to concomitantly examine a related motif: namely, the exiled hero's suitcase. In its conspicuousness, the suitcase not only represents the last tangible link between father and son, but it is also specifically identified as a soldier's suitcase [Soldatenkoffer] in the text, thereby establishing the link between the soldier as embodiment of the goal and the suitcase as the literal and figurative inheritance from the father. Put simply, the suitcase (paternal legacy) may be seen as the means and the soldier (paternal recognition) as the end. In this essay, I argue that, for Karl, the loss of the former symbolizes the impossibility of the latter. Despite the protagonist's intense longing for paternal acceptance, he is unable to retain the suitcase - much like Kafka himself, who was praised by his father "wenn [er] gut salutierte und marschierte" [saluted and marched well] but in the end was forced to admit to himself and his father that he was "kein künftiger Soldat" [no future soldier]. The opening sentence of the novel encapsulates the plot succinctly: Als der sechzehnjährige Karl Roßmann, der von seinen armen Eltern nach Amerika geschickt worden war, weil ihn ein Dienstmädchen verführt und ein Kind von ihm bekommen hatte, in dem schon langsam gewordenen Schiff in den Hafen von New York einfuhr, erblickte er die schon längst beobachtete Statue der Freiheitsgöttin wie in einem plötzlich stärker gewordenen Sonnenlicht [When the sixteen year-old Karl Rossmann , who had been sent to America by his poor parents because a servant girl had seduced him and become pregnant by him, entered the New York harbor on a ship that was slowly approaching the harbor , he noticed the Statue of Liberty that he had watched for a while suddenly appeared in a more radiant sunlight.] (Kafka, Der Verschollene 9)6 What promises at first to be a kind of modern Bildungsroman- in which the young European immigrant arrives in the United States, begins anew, and pursues the American dream of social and economic mobility - devolves into a nightmare, as Karl is expelled from one family constellation only to enter other ones, each lower in station and more unforgiving than the last. At each turn, he reassumes the filial role only to be deemed unworthy by the father figure and expelled from the ersatz family. In each case, the suitcase and allusions to the military play pivotal roles. The suitcase- which appears and disappears several times, only to be finally lost altogether- represents Karl's inability to carry on his father's legacy. Similarly, the motif of the soldier comes to symbolize a masculine ideal the protagonist longs to achieve, for it is an ideal he imagines would rehabilitate him in the eyes of his father. The pattern commences while Karl is still aboard the ship. Just as he is about to debark, he realizes he has left his umbrella below deck. Before descending into the ship's interior in order to retrieve the umbrella, he asks a</page><page sequence="3">54 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. fellow traveler to mind his suitcase. As Karl navigates the labyrinth of nearly empty corridors, hatches and cabins below deck, he comes across a crewman who, when Karl first sees him, is occupied with a suitcase of his own: "[U]nd [er] hörte nicht auf, an dem Schloß eines kleinen Koffers zu hantieren, den er mit beiden Händen immer wieder zudrückte, um das Einschnappen des Riegels zu behorchen" [And he did not stop plying the lock of a small suitcase, which he closed again and again with both hands in order to listen to the sound of the latch snapping into place] (A 10). The two then enter into a conversation that turns almost immediately to the subject of Karl's suitcase. When Karl suddenly realizes he has forgotten about the suitcase he had left with the acquaintance, the crewman remarks that both have probably disappeared. As Karl attempts to rise from the bunk on which he had been sitting in order to retrieve his piece of luggage the burly man pushes him back onto the bunk. Initially angered, Karl forgets about the suitcase entirely once he discovers that the man he has met is none other than the ship's stoker: "'Sie sind Schiffsheizer', rief Karl freudig, als überstiege das alle Erwartungen, und sah, den Ellbogen aufgestützt, den Mann näher an." [" You're the ship's stoker !" Karl cried out with joy ; as if that superseded all of his expectations and, propped up on his elboius, looked more intently at the man] (A 12). From this point on, Karl becomes drawn to the stoker and even entertains the idea of becoming one himself: '"Jetzt könnte ich auch Heizer werden' sagte Karl, 'meinen Eltern ist es jetzt ganz gleichgiltig [sie] was ich werde'" ["Noia I could become a stoker too," said Karl , "my parents don't care anymore what I become anyway"] (A 13). In addition, Karl feels perfectly and inexplicably content in the cramped cabin: "Er hatte fast das Gefühl davon verloren, daß er auf dem unsichern [sie] Boden eines Schiffes an der Küste eines unbekannten Erdteils war, so heimisch war ihm hier auf dem Bett des Heizers zumute" [He had almost lost the feeling of being on the shifting ground of a vessel sailing along the coast of an unfamiliar part of the world, so at home did he feel on the stoker's bed] (A 14). Only after the stoker sends Karl out of the cabin do Karl's thoughts again turn to his suitcase: Und er fand überhaupt, daß er lieber seinen Koffer hätte holen sollen [...]. Als ihm der Vater den Koffer für immer übergeben hatte, hatte er im Scherz gefragt: Wie lange wirst du ihn haben? und jetzt war dieser teuere Koffer vielleicht schon im Ernst verloren. Der einzige Trost war noch, daß der Vater von seiner jetzigen Lage nicht das allergeringste erfahren konnte, selbst wenn er nachforschen sollte. [And ite thought it would indeed have behooved him to go get his suitcase . . . When his father had handed over his suitcase for good, he had asked jokingly: So how long will you be able to keep it? And now the precious suitcase was perhaps lost in earnest. The only consolation lay in the fact that the father would not discover the slightest detail about his current predicament, even if he were to try to investigate.] (A 14-15)</page><page sequence="4">A Soldier and His Suitcase 55 In the short space of time it takes Karl to get to know the stoker, he twice forgets about his " teuere [n] Koffer" [ precious suitcase]. If I am correct in regarding the suitcase as a tangible symbol of the father's legacy, then Karl's own view of this legacy oscillates between two polar opposites. There is, on the one hand, Karl's desire to prove he is worthy to assume the role of a father (which, biologically speaking, he is), and on the other hand, a resignation to the fact that he is unfit to do so. Hence the idea of losing the suitcase can be seen, at one moment, to fill Karl with dread while at other times it affords him a sense of relief: no longer burdened by his father's unmet expectations, Karl is free to pursue his own dreams, albeit at the expense of paternal love. Each time he remembers the suitcase is missing, however, feelings of guilt and inadequacy return and his thoughts turn to his parents: that they do not care about him anymore or the shame he would feel were his father to know that his half-joking prediction that Karl would lose the suitcase has already come true. The value of the suitcase, therefore, is almost entirely abstract. How little material value the suitcase holds for Karl is underscored by the fact that he has hardly utilized any of its contents since the beginning of his journey (which at the time took about a week). Leid tat es aber Karl, daß er die Sachen im Koffer noch kaum verwendet hatte, trotzdem er es beispielsweise längst nötig gehabt hätte, das Hemd zu wechseln. Da hatte er also am unrichtigen Ort gespart; jetzt, wo er es gerade am Beginn seiner Laufbahn nötig haben würde, rein gekleidet aufzutreten, würde er im schmutzigen Hemd erscheinen müssen. Sonst wäre der Verlust des Koffers nicht gar so arg gewesen, denn der Anzug, den er anhatte, war sogar besser als jener im Koffer. [Karl's only regret was that he had hardly used the contents of the suitcase ; though it was high time, for instance , that he change his shirt. He'd been a bit too frugal; naiv, at the beginning of his career when he achially needed to be cleanly dressed he luould have to appear instead in a dirty shirt. Apart from that, the loss of the suitcase would not have been so tragic since the suit he had on was even better than the one in the suitcase.] (A 15) The potential loss of the suitcase only concerns Karl insofar as its loss would demonstrate he is not prepared for life, that he cannot make it on his own: in short, that he is unprepared to assume the duties of a father and is thus condemned to eternal sonhood. This dilemma informs Karl's mysterious connection to the stoker.7 On the surface, Karl and the stoker could not be more different. In the ship's hierarchy, the stoker occupies the lowest position. Karl, by comparison, is a son of a privileged household who has seen little of the world outside family and school. Rarely would two such figures cross paths, much less establish a personal bond. Yet they do. The link between them is suggested when Karl first encounters the crewman sitting inside his cabin, unlatching</page><page sequence="5">56 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. and latching the lock on his suitcase, over and over again, obsessed with the sound of the lock clicking into place, which, in turn, suggests an obsession with the security of the suitcase- as if it had been lost, stolen or looted previously. In the fourth chapter, it is revealed that Karl had been engaged in a similarly redundant exercise during much of his journey across the Atlantic: "Wieviele Stunden hatte er während der Überfahrt darauf verwendet, den Koffer zu ordnen und wieder neu zu ordnen" [Hoiv many hours he had spent during the voyage arranging and rearranging the contents of the suitcase ] (A 103 - my emphasis).8 Of course, the neurotic behavior exhibited by both Karl and the stoker does not serve any practical purpose; rather, it points to an unconscious fear of loss (locking and unlocking the suitcase) or fear of unpreparedness (rearranging the contents of the suitcase for hours on end). Both fears amount to what one might call filial anxiety : a fear of being unable to live apart from and independently of the father. The stoker's account of his life aboard ship parallels Karl's rejection by his biological father just as it anticipates his future rejection at the hands of other father figures. The stoker begins by revealing that he has served aboard a great number of ships: "Er nannte zwanzig Namen hinter einander als sei es ein Wort, Karl wurde ganz wirr" [He strung huenty ship names together as if they formed a single word, leaving Karl quite confused ] (A 14). The stoker further claims to have been an exemplary worker- "ein Arbeiter nach dem Geschmack meiner Kapitäne" [a crezaman who met the expectations of my captains]- whose service aboard the current vessel has been unfairly maligned: "[H]ier taug ich nichts, [. . .], bin ein Faulpelz, verdiene herausgeworfen zu werden und bekomme meinen Lohn aus Gnade" [Here I amount to nothing, I'm unfit, I deserve to be kicked off the ship and I'm only being paid out of mercy] ( A 14). As a consequence, the stoker is being dismissed from the ship: "Meine Stelle wird frei", sagte der Heizer, steckte im Vollbewußtsein dessen die Hände in die Hosentaschen und warf die Beine [. . .] aufs Bett hin, um sie zu strecken. Karl mußte mehr an die Wand rücken. "Sie verlassen das Schiff?" "Jawohl, wir marschieren heute ab." "Warum denn? Gefällt es Ihnen nicht?" "Ja, das sind so die Verhältnisse, es entscheidet nicht immer, ob es einem gefällt oder nicht." ["My position is going to be open," said the stoker, and, fully conscious of this fact, stuck his hands in his pant pockets and threw his legs onto the bunk in order to stretch them. Karl was forced to scoot even closer to the wall. " You're leaving the ship?" "Yes, sir - we're marching off today." " But why? Don't you like it here?" "Well, that's the way things are, it's not always a matter of whether a guy likes it or not."] (A 13) The flat trajectory of the stoker's life story prefigures Karl's fate both before and after his voyage to America. The stoker has been deemed unfit ("[H]ier taug ich nichts"), a remark that recalls Kafka's comment in the letter to his</page><page sequence="6">A Soldier and His Suitcase 57 father: "Aber dazu taugte ich nicht" [But I was unfit for it]. In the letter, Kafka gives the impression that he is merely repeating his father's verdict (that he is unfit), just as the stoker's remark recapitulates what he has been told by his superiors on ship and is not intended to represent his own opinion ("Hier taug ich nichts"). The term "taugen," which I have defined here as "to be fit (i.e. for a duty)" is the same one used in the German-speaking military to describe a potential recruit's suitability for military service (recruits are classified as "tauglich" or "untauglich,"- either fit or unfit, respectively).9 The term "taugen" as it is used in the letter suggests a hierarchical relationship between the elder and younger Kafka in which obedience to the will of the father is an absolute condition: the role of son consists of carrying out the father7 s will, much like the modus operandi aboard ship, where the orders of the captain are to be followed by all hands (and any notion of disobedience on the part of the lowest-ranking member of the crew- the stoker- is unthinkable). The stoker's service aboard so many vessels suggests the stoker has been hired and fired any number of times. He leads a life in which the repeated opening and closing of his suitcase lock comes to symbolize a life lived in a perpetual state of suspension, in a permanent state of transition, with no place to call home, where each acceptance precedes imminent rejection at the hands of the father- the father figure in this case being the captain of the ship. The name of the ship is completely irrelevant, as the stoker's rapid enumeration of all the ship names "als sei es ein Wort" [as if they formed a single word' makes clear: the experience is invariably the same. When Karl expresses an interest in becoming a stoker, the stoker responds with a Kafkaesque paradox that appears at first to be a piece of advice when in fact it is a prediction of Karl's future: "Sie denken wahrscheinlich nicht mit Entschlossenheit daran Heizer zu werden, aber gerade dann kann man es am leichtesten werden. Ich also rate Ihnen entschieden ab" [You're probably not thinking seriously about becoming a stoker, but it's precisely then that you most easily become one. I would absolutely advise against it] (A 13). The stoker's response renders Karl's intentions inconsequential because, as the stoker explains, to not seek out a career as a stoker is the same as seeking it ("aber gerade dann kann man es am leichtesten werden"- it's precisely then that you most easily become one). Therefore, becoming a "stoker" (read: a rootless individual in a permanent state of transition) is not a decision one makes at all, but a fate. The very reason Karl finds himself aboard a ship bound for a faraway land and an uncertain future is rejection by his father for an incident over which he had no control: Karl, as is later revealed, was raped by his family's maidservant. Again, this occurrence did not result from any decision on his part- it was merely his fate. In short, Karl does not need to aspire to become a "stoker" (read: a fatherless son in a state of permanent transition) at all because he has</page><page sequence="7">58 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. been one from the time he left Europe. This link between Karl's exile to America and his being a "stoker" is evident even in the manner in which the two figures come to meet. As he aimlessly wanders the corridors below deck, nominally in search of his umbrella, Karl hears the stoker before he sees him: In seiner Ratlosigkeit und da er keinen Menschen traf und nur immerfort über sich das Scharren der tausend Menschenfüße hörte und von der Ferne, wie einen Hauch, das letzte Arbeiten der schon eingestellten Maschinen merkte, fing er, ohne zu tiberlegen, an eine beliebige kleine Tür zu schlagen an, bei der er in seinem Herumirren stockte. [In his helplessness, and since Ite encountered no one and heard only the shuffling sound of a thousand human feet and, in the distance, like a faint whisper, the last work being performed on the already docked vessel he began, without thinking, to knock on a random little door which he stumbled upon as he meandered about] (A 10) This passage repeatedly underscores Karl's lack of agency in his initial encounter with the stoker. Karl's path does not follow any logic, much less any plan: he knocks on the hatch of the stoker s cabin randomly, without any forethought or intent whatsoever. His utter cluelessness is emphasized - to the point of redundancy- by the vocabulary, which includes such terms and phrases as Ratlosigkeit (helplessness), ohne zu überlegen (without thinking), beliebig (random), Herumirren (literally: straying) and stockte (literally: stalled, faltered). Karl does not so much decide to pay the stoker a visit as he is led to the stoker by an unconscious desire. That Karl, however improbably, is able to hear the faint sound off in the distance over "das Scharren der tausend Menschenfüße" [the shuffling sound of a thousand human feet] implies a connection between the two that is likewise unconscious. The sound that first leads Karl to the stoker is, of course, the sound of the stoker repeatedly clicking and unclicking the lock of his suitcase (an activity which he continues to perform for some time even after he and Karl begin their conversation). The circumstances of the encounter between Karl and the stoker are the first indication of many that Karl has discovered in the stoker a kindred spirit. In this way, going "below deck" comes to symbolize an internal journey at the subconscious level that reveals that Karl's identity and Karl's destiny are one and the same: the "stoker" is merely an external projection of Karl's fate. The essential difference between the two figures is quite minor: the stoker has more experience than Karl in this perpetual cycle of acceptance and rejection by one father-figure after another. That is, the stoker has more experience in going nowhere at all, a state of affairs that explains his initial reluctance to accept Karl's suggestion that he approach the captain with his grievances - the stoker knows all too well the futility of seeking justice before the father, whose authority is as unquestionable as it is absolute.</page><page sequence="8">A Soldier and His Suitcase 59 The feeling of kinship between Karl and the stoker is instant and mutual. After having only exchanged a few words with the stoker, Karl thinks to himself "Ich sollte mich vielleicht an diesen Mann halten [. . .], wo finde ich gleich einen bessern Freund" [Perhaps I should stick with this man, where could I find a better friend right now?] (A 11). The stoker has the same idea in mind, as suggested by his declaration- without needing to ask Karl's consent- that they will leave the ship together. Before disembarking, however, each intends to aid the other. Karl promises to help the stoker appeal his dismissal before the captain while the stoker promises to help Karl relocate his suitcase. Literally hand in hand,10 the two exit the cabin together, each determined to help the other achieve what he cannot achieve on his own. Predictably, both efforts meet with utter failure. As Karl attempts to argue on behalf of the stoker, one of the dignitaries on the bridge interrupts him and, following some perfunctory questioning, reveals himself to be none other than Karl's Uncle Jakob, a man who had immigrated to America years earlier and is now a successful businessman and senator. Uncle Jakob, it turns out, had already been made aware of the circumstances of Karl's exile and- to Karl's great embarrassment and shame - the uncle proceeds to reveal before everyone present the most intimate details of Karl's separation from his family. Following this episode, Karl loses the ability to express himself, as symbolized by his stillborn attempt to broach the subject of his suitcase : "'Nur meinen Koffer fürchte ich verloren zu Und damit erinnerte er sich an alles, was geschehen war und was noch zu tun übrig blieb, sah sich um und erblickte alle Anwesenden stumm vor Achtung und Staunen auf ihren früheren Plätzen, die Augen auf ihn gerichtet" ["/ just seem to have lost my suitcase ..." and with that he remembered everything that had happened and everything that remained yet to be done, looked around and saiu everyone standing in silent deference and wonder in their former places, eyes set squarely upon him] (A 37). Prior to this event, Karl had encouraged the stoker to stand up for himself before the captain, the "father" of the ship; yet in the presence of his own substitute father (Uncle Jakob), Karl is reduced to- returned to, really- a similar state of helplessness. For this reason, Karl's parting speech to the stoker could just as well be directed at himself: Und er gieng [. . .] zum Heizer, zog dessen rechte Hand aus dem Gürtel und hielt sie spielend in der seinen. "Warum sagst du denn nichts?" fragte er. "Warum läßt du dir das alles gefallen?" Der Heizer legte nur die Stirn in Falten, als suche er den Ausdruck für das was er zu sagen habe. [. . .] "Dir ist ein Unrecht geschehn wie keinem auf dem Schiff, das weiß ich ganz genau." [. . .] "Du mußt Dich aber zur Wehr setzen, ja und nein sagen, sonst haben ja die Leute keine Ahnung von der Wahrheit. Du mußt mir versprechen, daß Du mir folgen wirst, denn ich selbst, das fürchte ich mit vielem Grund, werde Dir gar nicht mehr helfen können. Und nun weinte Karl während er</page><page sequence="9">60 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. die Hand des Heizers küßte und nahm die rissige, fast leblose Hand und drückte sie an seine Wangen, wie einen Schatz, auf den man verzichten muß. [And he went to the stoker, took the tatter's right hand from his belt and held it, playing with it in his own. " Why don't you say anything ?" he asked. " Why do you put up with all of it?" The stoker just furrowed his brow, as if searching for the right words to express what he wanted to say. " You have been wronged like no one else aboard this ship, I know that for a fact é" " But you have to put up a fight, say yes and no, otherwise people have no idea what the truth is. You must promise ine that you'll do what I'm telling you because I have good reason to fear that I won't be able to help you anymore. And now Karl began to weep as he kissed the stoker's hand, took the cracked, almost lifeless hand and pressed it on his cheeks, like a treasure that has to be left behind.] (A 41) Karl asks the stoker why he does not stand up for himself only after Karl cannot bring himself to tell his uncle about the lost suitcase, which suggests that Karl is projecting his own feeling of inadequacy onto the stoker. Karl's inclination to see his own plight reflected in the experience of the stoker also informs Karl's odd claim that the stoker has suffered a greater injustice than anyone else on the ship. Objectively speaking, of course, Karl does not and cannot know the extent of the injustice the stoker has suffered -or whether the stoker has, in fact, suffered any injustice at all. He can only claim to feel so certain because, subjectively, he knows all too well the stoker's feeling of helplessness in the presence of the father figure. Karl knows what the stoker is enduring before the captain because Karl himself, at that very moment, is enduring exactly the same thing before Uncle Jakob: namely, the inability to articulate himself. In his aforementioned speech, Karl addresses the stoker with the familiar Du rather than the polite Sie he had been using up to this point, a sudden shift which has the effect of radically personalizing his speech and further reinforcing the impression that Karl is essentially speaking into the mirror. From the time Karl comes into contact with Uncle Jakob, it is assumed that the uncle will take Karl under his wing and raise him as his own son. This would appear, initially, to be a great stroke of luck for Karl. As the captain remarks to the young man: "Es ist der Staatsrat Edward Jakob, der sich Ihnen als Ihr Onkel zu erkennen gegeben hat. Es erwartet Sie nunmehr, doch wohl ganz gegen Ihre bisherigen Erwartungen eine glänzende Laufbahn" ["None other than the Senator Edward Jakob has just declared he is your uncle. Ncno - probably contrary to all your expectations thus far -a brilliant future career awaits you"] (A 31). As Karl and his uncle descend the stairs to board the boat that will take them to shore, however, Karl breaks down completely: "Der Senator gab Karl gerade eine Ermahnung zu vorsichtigem Hinuntersteigen, als Karl noch auf der obersten Stufe in heftiges Weinen ausbrach. Der Senator legte die</page><page sequence="10">A Soldier and His Suitcase 61 rechte Hand unter Karls Kinn, hielt ihn fest an sich gepreßt und streichelte ihn mit der linken Hand. So giengen sie langsam Stufe für Stufe hinab und traten engverbunden ins Boot" [The senator was reminding Karl to be careful on his way down when - still at the top of the stairs - Karl broke doom in heavy sobs. The senator put his right hand under KarVs chin and held him close while caressing him with his left hand. In this manner they descended, stair by stair, and, joined closely together, boarded the boat ] (A 43). Before he has even left the ship, Karl has been reduced to a state of infant-like dependency which is reflected in Karl's inability to speak. Indeed, he does not say a word for the remainder of the chapter. His tearful departure from the ship in the arms of his uncle is, on one level, a birth metaphor. At the same time, the passage can be read as a re- birth into the oppressive familial sphere in which Karl is forced to cast off the role of immigrant on the verge of starting a new life and, instead, is obliged to reassume the role of dependent son. His (biological) father7 s prediction that Karl would "lose the suitcase" has, despite his son's best efforts to avoid it, already come true and now he leaves the ship, sans suitcase, in the arms (literally and figuratively) of another "father" and to a future that is all too like his past. Under these conditions, is it surprising that Karl should break out in tears? As the uncle had revealed while still on the ship's bridge in the presence of the other dignitaries, his meeting Karl had been no chance encounter. The maidservant who had become pregnant by Karl had sent the uncle a letter which contained a description of Karl along with the name of the ship on which he was travelling. The uncle's presence aboard the ship, therefore, is quite intentional: he had, from the very beginning, every intention of adopting his nephew. At the symbolic center of this plan stands the suitcase, which mysteriously disappears until the uncle decides to make a permanent break with his nephew at the conclusion of the third chapter. Karl learns of his uncle's decision in the form of a letter his uncle has given a friend, Herr Green, to deliver to Karl, along with KarVs suitcase which he has not seen since leaving it aboard ship. In a virtual repetition of what Karl's father had said to him prior to his departure from Europe, the uncle admonishes Karl (via Hen- Green) to mind his suitcase in the future. "'Nun habe ich wenigstens meine alten Sachen wieder', sagte Karl und legte den Schirm auf den Koffer. 'Sie sollen aber besser in Zukunft auf sie achtgeben, läßt Ihnen der Herr Senator sagen', bemerkte Herr Green" ["At least I have my old things back again," said Karl as he laid his umbrella on the suitcase. "The senator said you ought to keep a better eye on them in the future ; " remarked Mr. Green] (A 98). During the time he had spent living with his uncle, Karl's freedom had been rigidly curtailed as Uncle Jakob sought to remake Karl in his own image. Indeed, it is for the high crime of spending the weekend at the estate of one of the uncle's friends, Herr</page><page sequence="11">62 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. Pollunder (at Pollunder's invitation), that Karl is punished so harshly and sent, once again, into exile. It was the uncle, however, who initially sought to find and establish a close relationship with Karl. This fact- alongside the revelation that the uncle was in possession of Karl's suitcase during the entire period Karl was living with him- makes Uncle Jakob's appearance aboard the ship seem less like an expression of familial love and something more like an ambush, an impression which is reinforced by the names of the keepers of the suitcase themselves. Karl originally leaves his suitcase in the care of a man whose first name is Franz. The uncle, who had secretly kept his bag all along, goes by the last name of Jakob- a name which, as Joseph Metz has pointed out, is the etymological root of the family name Kafka.11 The fact that Karl leaves the suitcase with a Franz and receives it back from a Jakob (i.e. Kafka) implies a struggle between son (Franz) and father (Kafka) over the son's fitness to assume the role of a father, a struggle for which the suitcase (more specifically: the ability to retain it) serves as a consistent and recurring metaphor.12 The paternal-filial struggle portrayed in the novel is not one in which a victor emerges. It is, instead, a struggle for recognition by the father. For Karl, the achievement of this status is embodied in the image of the soldier. The suitcase metaphor is soon juxtaposed with the soldier motif to express the longing for and fulfillment of a status which could someday elicit the father's recognition and respect. The soldier motif first appears in the opening chapter as Karl is arguing the stoker's case before the captain. While advocating on behalf of the stoker, Karl imagines how his parents might react if they could only see him at that moment: Karl allerdings fühlte sich so kräftig und bei Verstand, wie er es vielleicht zu hause [sie] niemals gewesen war. Wenn ihn doch seine Eltern sehen könnten, wie er im fremden Land vor angesehenen Persönlichkeiten das Gute verfocht und wenn er es auch noch nicht zum Siege gebracht hatte, so doch zur letzten Eroberung sich vollkommen bereit stellte. Würden sie ihre Meinung über ihn revidieren? [Karl, however, felt more powerful and lucid than he had perhaps ever felt at home. If only his parents could see him, how he was championing the cause of the good in a foreigti land in the presence of digtiitaries and even if he were not yet able to achieve victory he had nonetheless positioned himself for the final conquest. Would they revise their opinion of him?] (A 29 - my emphasis) Here Karl can be seen to indulge in the fantasy that he has already achieved adulthood before he has even stepped off of the ship, a fantasy that derives from the fact that he never stood up to his father at home. In the fantasy, by contrast, he is confident in himself "wie er es vielleicht zu hause niemals gewesen war" [more... than he had perhaps ever felt at home]. By standing up to a father (the captain)- albeit not his father- Karl believes to have demonstrated the requisite courage necessary to elicit his father's respect. The moment the</page><page sequence="12">A Soldier and His Suitcase 63 uncle steps forward and Karl finds himself returned to the role of son, however, he becomes the opposite of "kräftig und bei Verstand" [poiuerftil and lucid'. He is reduced, instead, to a wholly dependent, even infantile state: sobbing so heavily in the arms of his uncle that he is incapable of speech. Yet for a brief moment he entertains the notion that he has attained the status of an adult male, an idea he associates with soldiery and which is expressed in this passage through the metaphors of victory in battle and conquest. Elsewhere, as well, the notion of having reached manhood is expressed through allusions to military service. During Karl's extended stay with his uncle in New York, for example, he plays music on a piano that his uncle has provided him. While seated at the instrument, Karl enjoys playing, more than any other piece, "ein altes Soldatenlied seiner Heimat, das die Soldaten am Abend, wenn sie in den Kasernenfenstern liegen und auf den finstern Platz hinausschauen, von Fenster zu Fenster einander zusingen" [an old soldier's ditty from his native country that the soldiers, in the evening , while lying inside the barracks windows looking out upon the dim parade grounds , would sing to one another from one zuindaiv to the next] (A 50 - my emphasis). Karl is too young to have served in the army himself and so would have presumably learned the origin of the ditty from his father, for he not only knows the melody of the text but also the details of when and where it is sung, esoterica that would only be known to someone with military experience.13 The impression that Karl has learned these details from his father appears confirmed when Herr Pollunder, upon returning the suitcase to Karl, takes the opportunity to ask him: "Was ist das eigentlich für ein merkwürdiger Koffer?" to which Karl proudly responds: "Es ist ein Koffer, mit dem die Soldaten in meiner Heimat zum Militär einrücken, [. . .] es ist der alte Militärkoffer meines Vaters" ["So what kind of strange suitcase is that, anyway ?" . . . "It is a suitcase which the soldiers in my country carry when they enlist . . . it's my father's old military suitcase "] (A 98).14 For Karl, the suitcase is no mere object, but an inheritance, which he, literally and figuratively, carries with him as a burden from one place to another. At the same time, he is terrified of losing it. The suitcase is a source of pride in his own father, just as it is, at times, a source of his own shame, a reminder that he has been rejected by his family, that he has not become that man who is worthy of carrying the suitcase, that he is not- and probably never will be- a "soldier" in the eyes of his father (hence the significance of the father's prediction that Karl would lose it).15 The soldier as a motif that stands for manhood is, as I have shown, one that has its origin in the biography of both the author and his protagonist, Karl. One must also bear in mind, however, that in a society that maintains a draft, military service is regarded not only as a legal requirement but as a rite of passage.16 It is a narrative of masculinity that remains with us to this day: one enters basic training as a boy and emerges as a man. During the</page><page sequence="13">64 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. Grundausbildung, or "boot camp" as it is known in the United States, the recruit is subjected to grueling mental and physical challenges which test his mettle. If he successfully completes the training, he is allowed the privilege- so goes the narrative- of wearing the uniform, a uniform that advertises his successful completion of the rite of passage. In Amerika , the suitcase functions much the same way- except that in the case of Karl, he only carries his father's military legacy (a symbol of his father's transition from boyhood to manhood), but does not and cannot wear it. The night he receives his suitcase from Herr Pollunder, Karl leaves the estate on foot, suitcase in hand, and eventually ends up in a cheap boarding house, where he has to spend the night with two derelicts who, fast asleep, already occupy the darkened room's two beds. Seeing this, Karl fetches a candle, lights it, and as his very first action "wollte seinen Koffer untersuchen um einmal einen Überblick über seine Sachen zu bekommen, an die er sich schon nur undeutlich erinnerte" [wanted to inspect his suitcase in order to get an overviezu of things which he could only vaguely remember] ( A 102). Finding the contents of the suitcase still in order, he is relieved. As his two roommates still lie sleeping, Karl sinks into an armchair, grimly determined to maintain a vigilant watch over his "erst wiedergewonnenen Koffer" [; recently recovered suitcase] (A 102). While fighting to stay awake, he withdraws from the suitcase his most prized possession: a photograph of his parents. Tellingly, he does not merely glance at the picture. In a gesture that is half wish-fulfillment, half plea for help, Karl desperately attempts to look the image of his father in the eye, but finds that he cannot: "Desto genauer sah er die vor ihm liegende [Photographie] an und suchte von verschiedenen Seiten den Blick des Vaters aufzufangen. Aber der Vater wollte, wie er auch den Anblick durch verschiedene Kerzenstellungen änderte, nicht lebendiger werden" [He looked at the photograph that lay before him all the more closely and attempted to catch his father's gaze. However , the father -no matter hmv much he attempted to change the angle of the view by moving the candle - did not want to become any more animate] (A 106). The anthropomorphic shift in narration- "der Vater wollte nicht lebendiger werden" [did not want to become any more animate]- points to Karl's longing for acceptance by a father whom he anticipates he will never see again- who is, for all intents and purposes, dead (a double-entendre suggested by the phrase "wollte nicht lebendiger werden"). Yet Karl still feels unworthy in the imagined presence of his father, a sentiment embodied in his literal inability to look the older man in the eye. Karl's desperate attempts to meet the paternal gaze derive from a feeling of inadequacy that Karl, as he had done aboard ship, immediately measures against his soldier-fantasy: Ebenso gut hätte er damals schwören können, dass er nach zwei Monaten amerikanischen Aufenthaltes General der amerikanischen Miliz sein werde,</page><page sequence="14">A Soldier and His Suitcase 65 während er tatsächlich in einer Dachkammer mit zwei Lumpen beisammen war, in einem Wirthaus vor New-york [sie] und außerdem zugeben mußte, daß er hier wirklich an seinem Platze war. [Back then Ite could just as well have sworn that he would become a getterai iti the American militia within two months of his arrival iti America, while in reality he was in an attic with two ne'er-do-wells in a boarding house near New York and beyond that had to admit that it was here where he really belonged.] (A 10 7)17 Karl's image of himself as a soldier is, as it had been on the ship's bridge while he had sought to defend the stoker, the one that he imagines would vindicate him in the eyes of his absent father. In this passage, the fantasy is writ especially large: Karl is not merely a soldier but a general in the American military, a fantasy that functions as -and stands in inverse proportion to- the crushing guilt he feels in that moment for having not lived up to his father's expectations. The paternal gaze is as emotionally tangible as it is physically absent. While the father does not and cannot know what has become of his son, Karl has internalized the father's judgment and is thus unable to escape it. Even more, he cannot escape his longing for recognition by the father, cannot escape the longing to be, at long last, auf Augenhöhe mit dem Vater [at eye level with his father]. In this way, the paternal gaze encompasses, at once, a pervasive dread as well as a desire that remains ultimately and frustratingly unattainable. The next morning, he sets out with the two men with whom he had shared the room to find work. Predictably, the two vagabonds take advantage of Karl whenever possible, eating his food, insisting he pay for meals and, finally, ransacking the suitcase in Karl's absence, dumping its contents on the ground alongside the road: "[E]r [sah] zu seinem Schrecken seinen Koffer, den er abgesperrt zurückgelassen hatte und dessen Schlüssel er in der Tasche trug, vollständig geöffnet [. . .], während der halbe Inhalt ringsherum im Gras verstreut war" [To his horror , he found his suitcase , which he had left locked and the key to which he carried in his pocket , wide open, while half of its contents lay all around , strewn about the grass] (A 126). As he had done aboard ship, Karl had left his suitcase in the possession of strangers, except this time, he had left it in the care of strangers he knows to be little better than petty thieves (!). Here, as well, Karl goes from obsession with the security of the suitcase to complete neglect of it, a pattern consistent with the extremes of longing (to prove his manhood) and despair (the impression that he deserves his fate) he had felt while staring at the portrait of his parents. This time Karl confronts his erstwhile companions, one of whom bears down on him in a physically threatening manner. Before violence erupts, however, Karl is summoned by an employee from the nearby hotel. The summons diffuses a potential fight that would almost surely have ended badly for him. Before Karl leaves with the</page><page sequence="15">66 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. employee, however, he inspects his suitcase to find that the photograph of his parents has gone missing, which sends him into a near panic. The photo, he explains, "war mir wichtiger, als alles was ich sonst im Koffer habe" [" was dearer to me than anything else I have in the suitcase "] (A 130). When his erstwhile companions claim not to have seen the photograph, the hotel employee suggests Karl search their pockets. First, however, Karl makes them an astonishing offer: "[I]ch muß die Photographie finden. Aber ehe ich die Taschen durchsuche, sage ich noch, daß, wer mir die Photographie freiwillig gibt, den ganzen gefüllten Koffer bekommt" ["/ have to find the photograph. But before I search your pockets , I want to let you knoiv that whoever gives me the photograph voluntarily gets the entire suitcase , fully packed "] (A 131). This sudden crisis sheds light upon Karl's priorities. He does not value any item of clothing or jewelry (or, indeed, even the suitcase itself) as much as he does the photo of his parents. The game he had played with the photograph on the preceding night helps to explain why this is the case: Karl yearns for the day he will earn his father's recognition. This yearning is, as I have sought to show, both a desire and a burden. In this way, Karl's panic at the loss of the photograph demonstrates that the lightest object in the suitcase (the photograph) was, psychologically speaking, also the heaviest. Karl never sees the photograph again.18 The Soldatenmotif reappears in the following chapter as well, as Karl finds a new benefactor in the form of Grete Mitzelbach, the head cook of the Hotel Occidental. The head cook decides to hire Karl in large part because he is also German,19 and the two spend much of what little free time they enjoy speaking in their native tongue and reminiscing about the old country. While alone in her quarters, Karl surveys a number of photographs which the Oberköchin [head cook] has framed or put under glass for display. Unsurprisingly, his gaze falls on the photograph of a soldier: "Unter den Herrenbildern fiel Karl besonders das Bild eines jungen Soldaten auf [. . .] Alle diese Photographien stammten wohl noch aus Europa" [Among the images of men the picture of a soldier stood out to Karl. All of these photographs were probably taken in Europe] (A 138-139). The picture of the soldier can of course be interpreted as again reflecting Karl's dream of achieving the unattainable ideal of manhood but the special attention he pays to the soldier's image also serves as a commentary on and prelude to all of the struggles Karl endures at the hands of one father figure after another.20 The soldier is feared and respected for his ability and willingness to engage in war- which, at its core, is systematized violence and, indeed, the threat of violence marks virtually every one of the father-figures whom Karl encounters. The willingness on the part of these figures to mete out punishment is symbolized by the fact that each wields or carries a sharp or threatening object. The captain of the ship is depicted as wearing "die</page><page sequence="16">A Soldier and His Suitcase 67 Schiffsuniform" [the ship uniform] and playing "mit dem Griff des Degens" [the hilt of a sword] (A 19). Standing alongside the captain of the ship is the uncle, who is carrying "ein dünnes Bambusstöckchen, das, da er beide Hände an den Hüften festhielt, auch wie ein Degen abstand" [a thin bamboo cane that ; since he had both hands on his hips , also stuck out like a dagger] (A 19). Karl's biological father is depicted in the single photograph Karl possesses of him as standing with one hand "zur Faust geballt" [balled into a fist] (A 106). The Oberportier [head porter], who physically abuses Karl and fires him for having left his post for five minutes wears "[e]in[en] glänzende[n] schwarze[n] Schnurrbart, weit in Spitzen ausgezogen so wie ihn Ungarn tragen, [der] sich auch bei der schnellsten Kopfwendung nicht [rührte]" [a shiny black mustache ; twirled into sharp points at its tips as is customary in Hungary , which , even with the quickest turn of the head, did not budge] (A 172). The moustache is described, in other words, as being more akin to steely, sharp spikes than something organically human. One of Karl's vagabond companions, a Frenchman by the name of Delamarche, takes the salami Karl's mother had packed inside the suitcase and cuts it "mit seinem dolchartigen Messer" [with his dagger-like knife] (A 111). The Frenchman's derelict partner, Robinson- who later acts as the enforcer for the prostitute Brunelda and maintains Karl in a state of involuntary servitude - addresses Karl with a dagger in his hand: "'Du bist eben noch ein Kind, Roßmann,' sagte Robinson, zog einen Dolch, den er an einer Halsschnur trug, unter dem Hemd hervor, nahm die Dolchkappe ab und zerschnitt die harte Wurst" [" You're still a child, Rossmann said Robinson, took out a dagger which he wore on a cord around his neck from beneath his shirt and cut the hard sausage] (A 231).21 Each of the father figures is distinguished from Karl by the willingness to mete out psychological and physical punishment; in the case of the father and the uncle, the punishment is psychological, leaving wounds that are more lasting than physical ones, as Karl's obsession with both the suitcase and the photograph inside it attests. Each of the father-figures punishes Karl in an effort to maintain his economic status. As the uncle reveals on the ship's bridge, even the decision to send Karl to America was motivated in part by the father's desire to avoid "Alimentenzahlung" [child support] for Karl's son (34). The inclination to view money as a higher value than love can be seen in Karl's relationship to other father-figures, as well. In his farewell letter to Karl, the uncle alludes to "Principien" [ principles ] which allow him to keep the vaguely defined "allgemeinen Angriff" [general assault] he sees all around him at bay (A 97). Uncle Jakob bases his decision to shun his nephew on the latter's having "gegen meinen Willen dafür entschieden, heute Abend von mir wegzugehen" [decided, against my zoili, to leave me tonight] (A 97). The head porter, a man whose petty authority can hardly compare to that of a senator, nonetheless</page><page sequence="17">68 Charles H . Hammond , Jr. gives a very similar explanation of his decision to fire Karl from the hotel staff: "Es handelt sich um meine Autorität, da steht viel auf dem Spiel, so ein Junge verdirbt mir die ganze Bande. Gerade bei den Liftjungen muß man teuflisch aufpassen" ["It comes down to my authorìty. There's a lot at stake since a boy like this can spoil the entire lot. You have to be especially vigilant when it comes to the lift boys"] (A 180). Later, Robinson punishes Karl in order to maintain his place as Delamarche's servant, just as Delamarche punishes Karl in order to maintain his place as Brunelda's servant, and so on. The primacy of economic status above all things creates a rigid, military-like hierarchy, which demands the willingness to punish any infraction of discipline, real or perceived, on the part of any subordinate, professional or familial. This militaristic hierarchy is one in which Karl- who lacks this willingness- has no place. He is too humane, too decent, too averse to the notion of becoming like those who punish him. Following the stoker's failed attempt to get a hearing before the captain, Uncle Jakob senses Karl's unwillingness to accept the status quo. In an effort to make his nephew aware of the importance of hierarchy and discipline, the uncle tells him "Lerne deine Stellung begreifen" ["Learn to know your position "] (A 41) and explains that discipline is, ultimately, of greater importance than justice: "Mißverstehe die Sachlage nicht [. . .], es handelt sich vielleicht um eine Sache der Gerechtigkeit, aber gleichzeitig um eine Sache der Disciplin. Beides und ganz besonders das letztere unterliegt hier der Beurteilung des Herrn Kapitäns" ["Don't misunderstand the issue . . .it is , perhaps, a matter of justice but at the same time it is a matter of discipline. Both - and in particular the latter -are subject to the judgment of the captain "] (A 40). In the military, the primary importance of discipline is beyond question because without it the hierarchy would fall apart. Indeed, the primacy of discipline is one of the fundamental reasons for which the military has always maintained its own legal system (where the bar for conviction is significantly lower than in its civil counterpart). The novel depicts the world of economic competition among men as one in which, as in the military, the maintenance of discipline take precedence over the dispensation of justice. In his farewell letter to Karl, Uncle Jakob acknowledges that the internalization of discipline in the service of hierarchy has its costs. Yet, for anyone seeking to establish himself economically, the system must be strictly obeyed. He explains: "[Ich bin] ein Mann von Principien. Das ist nicht nur für meine Umgebimg sondern auch für mich sehr unangenehm und traurig, aber ich verdanke meinen Principien alles was ich bin" [" I am a man of principles. Though it is unpleasant and sad , not only for those around me but for myself personally, I oive everything that I am to my principles "] (A 96-97). The "Principien" to which the uncle is referring are precisely those he had attempted to instill in his nephew: the military-like respect for hierarchy and discipline. Karl, however, never</page><page sequence="18">A Soldier and His Suitcase 69 adopts the uncle's principles. Thus, as the novel progresses, Karl is seen to fall from one economic rung to the next in a tragicomic reversal of the American dream.22 Karl does not internalize this system for the simple reason that he lacks the ability to do so. This conclusion sheds light on the protagonist's fantasy of one day becoming a soldier. After all, were he able to embrace the principle of discipline in the service of hierarchy, he could be a son like his father and thus one whom his father - or father -figures whom he encounters in the course of his journey- could accept. Like the author, however, Karl is "kein künftiger Soldat" [no future soldier]. He is no more able to carry on the law of the father than he is able to carry his father's suitcase, a military suitcase he inherits from his father, a suitcase which he knows from the very beginning he will lose despite his best attempts to cling to it. Ultimately, the loss of the suitcase prefigures Karl's inability to survive in his new environment as he travels from one socioeconomic stratum to a lower one, where the surroundings may be different but the principle of discipline in the service of hierarchy always remains the same. Though the novel is incomplete, it is probable that, in the end, Karl was to fall out of society entirely. This ending is not only suggested in Kafka's working title for the novel (Der Verschollene -The Disappeared One), but elsewhere, as well. In a 1915 diary entry, Kafka remarks on the protagonists of Amerika and Der Proceß [The Trial]: "Roßmann und K, der Schuldlose und der Schuldige, schließlich beide unterschiedslos strafweise umgebracht, der Schuldlose mit leichterer Hand, mehr zur Seite geschoben als niedergeschlagen'" [Rossmann and K, the innocent one and the guilty one, ultimately both killed indiscriminately as punishment , the innocent one with a lighter hand, more pushed aside than beaten doom] (Kafka, Tagebücher 101). It is, in my view, profoundly significant that Kafka refers to Karl as "der Schuldlose" [the innocent one], for it lends support to a reading of the novel as the story of a protagonist who is punished repeatedly - and killed, ultimately -for the crime of never losing his humanity. Yet the novel- even in its fragmentary state- does not end there. After not having worked on the novel for approximately two years, Kafka returned to it in October 1914, in order to write the final chapter which he entitled "Das Naturtheater von Oklahoma" [ Nature Theater of Oklahoma]. Within the scope of this essay I can merely draw attention to the fact that the paradisiacal setting of the Naturtheater is conceived as a sanctuary for artists. The placard advertising the Naturtheater which first captures Karl's attention reads, in part: "Wer Künstler werden will, melde sich!" [Whoever desires to become an artist should report !] (A 295) In the Naturtheater, there is no longer any parental pressure to</page><page sequence="19">70 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. become something one is not, an idea that is suggested by the absence of luggage: "Karl bemerkte es erst jetzt - niemand trug ein Gepäckstück" [Karl only noticed it naiu - no one was carrying any luggage] ( A 316). This line, which appears in the penultimate paragraph of the final complete chapter, stands in stark contrast to the first mention of luggage, which appears in the second paragraph of the first chapter: "'So hoch', sagte er sich und wurde, wie er so gar nicht an das Weggehn dachte, von der immer mehr anschwellenden Menge der Gepäckträger, die an ihm vorüberzogen, allmählich bis an das Bordgeländer geschoben" ["So high , " he said to himself and was , as he was not thinking of leaving, pushed up against the railing by the growing number of luggage carriers, who were streaming by him] (A 9). At the outset of the novel, in other words, Karl is almost pushed overboard by the sheer number of luggage carriers, in a foreshadowing of his death at the hands of the father: " mehr zur Seite geschoben als umgebracht" f more pushed aside than beaten down]. Only in the Naturtheater , in this otherworldly place, described as being "fast grenzenlos [. . .] ein altes Teater [sic], aber es wird immerfort vergrößert" [almost limitless . . . it's an old theater, but it is constantly being expanded] (A 300), is he able to find salvation. Ironically, it is only when Karl discovers this ethereal destination- a land of art by, of and for artists- that he arrives, at long last, in the land of the free and the home of the brave.23 Notes 1. This and all subsequent translations are my own. To date, there have been three English translations of the novel (all of which were published under the title Amerika): one by Willa and Edwin Muir, one by Michael Hofmann and a more recent (2008) translation by Mark Harman. While I have found much to admire in all three, there are instances in which the translations, in my view, could be improved even further. For this reason, I have decided to provide my own. 2. See von Hirschhausen 553: " After 1868 citizenship was linked to compulsory military service. The latter had been introduced during the transformation of the neo-absolutist empire into a constitutional dual monarchy and was to bind the armed forces and society much closer together/7 3. To my knowledge, there has been no substantive discussion of the soldier as a motif in Kafka criticism. Other than in the Brief an den Vater, the figure of the soldier is absent in his non-fictional works, and the only fictional work in which a soldier figures prominently is, of course, In der Strafkolonie [In tìie Penal Colony], where an unnamed Offizier [officer] instructs the Reisender [traveler] on the operation of the execution device. 4. Kafka had given his manuscript the working title Der Verschollene [Tìie Disappeared One], which Kafka's friend and literary executor, Max Brod, subsequently published under the title Amerika. I have chosen to use the latter title in this paper because it is the one under which the work is best known in both German as well as most English translations. The title Amerika also underscores, in my view, Karl's exile and displacement rather than his ultimate fate and it is the former with which I am most concerned here.</page><page sequence="20">A Soldier and His Suitcase 71 5. As Heinz Politzer has shown, "Karl Rossmann' s possibilities lie [. . .] in the prospect of his becoming a Mann" (121). As Herbert Lehnert has pointed out, Kafka himself regarded the family as an unattainable ideal: "Das bürgerliche Familienleben wertete er keineswegs ab wie seine 'expressionistischen' Zeitgenossen, im Gegenteil es war ihm ein unerreichbares Ideal" ["By no means did he reject bourgeois family life like his 'expressionist' contemporaries - on the contrary, it was, for him, an unattainable ideal"] (843). 6. Subsequent references to this volume are abbreviated as A. 7. Other critics have commented on the significance of the suitcase. According to Michael P. Ryan, "[t]he suitcase, handed over by the father, could be an early representation of the burden placed on Gregor Samsa in "Die Verwandlung" [The Metamorphosis]. He does not develop this idea further, however. Anne Fuchs has provided the most thorough discussion of the suitcase to this point, an object which she regards as, "[f]irst and foremost, a symbol of Karl's European 'baggage'" in the modern, colloquial sense of the term, further asserting that "it is the very reappearance of Karl's European belongings that keep him from belonging anywhere and turn him into [Julia] Kristeva's stray subject" (197). 8. See also A 105: "[Karl] verschob vorläufig das Packen des Koffers, da er ja dafiir die ganze Nacht noch verwenden konnte " [Karl put off packing his suitcase , since he could still spend the entire night doing that 1 (my emphasis). 9. 1 am indebted here to Friederike von Schwerin-High for pointing out the significance of the term "tauglich" in the military context. 10. "Er faßte Karl bei der Hand, nahm im letzten Augenblick ein Muttergottesbild von der Wand über dem Bett, stopfte es in seine Brusttasche, ergriff seinen Koffer und verließ mit Karl eilig die Kabine" [He took Karl by the hand, at the last second took a picture of the Madonna from the wall above the bed, stuffed it into his breast pocket, grabbed his suitcase and hurriedly exited the cabin with Karl] (A 17). 11. See Metz 654: "Kafka's own name derives from the Hebrew 'Yakov,' 'Jacob.'" Metz regards Kafka's choice of the name as "a signifier for West Jewish isolation and lack of community." 12. In his examination of Kafka's planned trilogy Die Söhne [The Sons], a volume that was to include Das Urteil [The Judgment], Die Verwandlung [The Metamorphosis] and Der Heizer [The Stoker- which later became the first chapter of Amerika], Ryan asserts several such cryptic references. As he explains, "Kafka's tendency to create names of characters that accentuate their biographical nature, names that appear to be cryptograms of his own, suggests that he suffers the tortures in Die Söhne " (77). 13. Kafka's own biography provides a probable source for the army ditty. Max Brod explains that Hermann Kafka's experience as a soldier played an important role in the man he was to become: "Hermann diente drei Jahre als Soldat, sprach auch im Alter gern von seiner Militärzeit, sang Militärlieder [. . .] falls er guter Laune war [Hermann served three years as a soldier, like to speak of his time in the service, sang military songs (Über F.K. 14 - emphasis mine). 14. That the elder Kafka recounted stories from his military service to Franz is also evident in the Brief an den Vater, in which Franz Kafka quotes one of his father's oft-repeated stories: '" Von zuhause bekam ich gar nichts, nicht einmal beim Militär, ich schickte noch Geld nachhause'" (Kafka, Zur Frage 29). Franz Kafka reveals in the letter that he regarded such statements as "Vorwürfe" [accusations] that his father would repeat in order to suggest that his son led a comparably easy life (29).</page><page sequence="21">72 Charles H. Hammond , Jr. 15. Kafka's feelings toward his father were similarly conflicted. As Lehnert has remarked: "Aus dem Brief [an den Vater] spricht eine Haßliebe, in der letzten Endes das Liebesverlangen dominiert" [The Letter to tive Father expresses a love-hate sentiment in which the desire to be loved ultimately dominates] (867). 16. This was particularly true of Austria-Hungary / Austria prior to the horror of the First and Second World Wars, after which the draft was regarded by many, understandably, with considerably more skepticism. See Lahodynsky. According to a poll conducted by the Austrian weekly Profil in January 2011, only 36% of the Austrian population remains in favor of maintaining the draft, while approximately 42% favor an all-volunteer military. I would like to express my gratitude to Professors Thomas Winkelbauer and Karl Vocelka for bringing this recent survey to my attention. 17. As Joseph Vogl has pointed out, the ability of modern figures to observe themselves brings with it a number of potential problems: "Sehen heisst also zugleich gesehen werden, Beobachter sind zugleich Beobachtete und gerade diese Relativität des Blicks stellt Kafkas Figuren auf einen doppelten Boden" [To see is, simultaneously, to be seen, observers are simultaneously observed and it is precisely this relativity of the gaze that places Kafka's figures on a dual ground] (14). The passage from the text makes clear that this dichotomy (seeing / being seen) is particularly evident in the case of Karl, who observes himself both through the lens of his soldier-fantasy as well as through the (imagined) eyes of his parents, who would, he imagines, find that Karl was where he belonged. It is this shifting between two polar opposites (a euphoric fantasy and a fatalistic reality) that informs Karl's schizophrenic relation to his suitcase. 18. Fuchs has suggested that "the loss of the picture upsets [Karl] greatly because it was the only private document apparently authenticating his existence" (199). 19. See A 134. 20. Elizabeth Boa has provided an interpretation of Karl that comes close to blaming Karl for his tragic fate: "For although he travels forwards physically, at each challenge he regresses psychologically. The successive retreats can be seen in the context of changing gender discourse under the impact of modernity. Modern man throws off the shackles of the patriarchal order only to unleash naked competition between men and the sex war between men and women. The New Woman as emergent female subject drives the modernizing project forwards but threatens male dominance, whereas Woman as fleshy object of distracting lust retards Man on his Odyssey to transform the world. Faced with such challenges Karl Rossmann flees and is no closer to manhood at the end than the beginning" (168-169). I would assert just the opposite: a close reading of the text will reveal that Karl becomes, over time, more inclined to stand up for himself and more inclined to resist others' efforts to impose their control on him. 21. While not a father-ñguie, even the Statue of Liberty, which Karl admires as his ship enters New York harbor, is portrayed as holding aloft "ein Schwert" [a sword] rather than a torch (A 9)! As a symbol of America, the statue with the sword (rather than the torch) appears to embody the patriarchal principle upon which the New World- much like the Old World- is organized. This symbolism anticipates his treatment at the hand of various father-figures, who are essentially no different from his biological father back home. 22. Mark Anderson has argued that Max Brod's decision to publish the novel under the title Amerika obscures the fact that "Kafka's texts are rarely located in a geographically or temporally specific landscape" (103), and indeed, Kafka was not interested in America as a geographic phenomenon. The text goes out of its way to show this through its many</page><page sequence="22">A Soldier and His Suitcase 73 inaccuracies: locating San Francisco on the East Coast, conjuring a giant bridge that connects the cities of New York and Boston, replacing Lady Liberty's torch with a sword, and so on. However, America provides a perfect thematic backdrop to the novel, enabling Kafka to tell the story of Karl Roßmann as an American dream that unfolds in reverse. For this reason, I actually find Broďs title to be quite appropriate. 23. See also Brod 260. Brod famously relates his account of what Kafka had intended for Karl Rossmann: "Mit rätselhaften Worten deutete Kafka lächelnd an, daß sein Held in diesem 'fast grenzlosen' Theater Beruf, Freiheit, Rückhalt, ja sogar die Heimat und die Eltern wie durch paradiesischen Zauber wiederfinden werde" [Kafka suggested cryptically, with a smile, that his hero would rediscover in this ' almost limitless ' theater a profession, freedom, support, even the home country and his parents as if by some paradisiacal magic]. With my reading I suggest that there is no necessary contradiction between Brod's account and Kafka's remarks on Karl's fate. For this reason, I think Georg Guntermann's suggestion to be only partially correct when he states: "Karl Rossmann ist unterwegs in Amerika wie Josef K. auf dem Weg zum Gericht in der Stadt und wie K. auf dem Weg zum Schloß. Alle sind unterwegs zu einem Ziel, das sie nicht erreichen werden" [Karl Rossmann is in transit in Amerika like Josef K ori the way to the court iti the city and like K on the way to the castle. All are on their way to a destination they will never reach] (Guntermann 81). I regard this novel to be fundamentally different from the other two in this regard: the protagonist does arrive at his goal (though it is an imagined place). Works Cited Anderson, Mark M.
