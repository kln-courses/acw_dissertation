Susan Williams NASA Langley Research Center Hampton, VA ABSTRACT This report summarizes the experimental research conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center on general aviation seat and occupant crash response and discusses seat design considerations. Included are typical floor acceleration pulses from general aviation airplane crash tests, the performance of typical general aviation seats in a simulated crash environment, and the performance of prototype energy absorbing (EA) seat designs. Static and dynamic seat testing procedures and test facilities are discussed. Also presented are results from a series of dynamic tests of typi- cal general aviation seats and prototype EA seats. IN 1973, A GENERAL-AVIATION crash-test program (ref. 1) was initiated jointly by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Studies were directed toward those crashes in which the airplane structure retains sufficient cabin volume and integrity for occupant survivability. As part of this program, the NASA Langley Research Center conducted a series of crash tests to obtain information on crashes of general-aviation airplanes under controlled free-flight conditions (refs. 2-10). The objec- tives were to determine the dynamic response of the airplane structure, seats, and occupants during a crash; to determine the effects of flight parameters at impact on the magnitude and pattern of structural damage; and to determine the loads imposed upon the occupants. This information is essential for predicting struc- tural collapse and for designing safer seats, safer occupant-restraint systems, and safer cabin structures. During the full-scale general aviation crash tests, various types of seat failures were observed. Failures were noticed in seat pans, seat legs, seat attachments to the floor track, welds, rivets, lap belts, and shoulder harness inertia reels. Also, it was noted that a seat that passed a static test might fail an "equivalent" dynamic test. Therefore, we undertook an examination of various seat designs and their performance during static and dynamic seat tests. The results of the various static and dynamic seat tests are discussed and seat design considera- tions are presented. Since the crushable material in the sub- floor of general aviation aircraft is minimal and since the seated human body can tolerate less acceleration along the spine, the accelera- tion in the vertical direction deserves close attention. Consequently, this paper will con- centrate on the vertical direction; the horizontal case can be considered analogously. CRASHWORTHY SEAT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS Previously, crashworthy seat design may not have received the attention that it deserved. Perhaps in the past, weight, comfort, looks, and other factors may have been considered first when designing a new seat. However, a survey of recent literature shows that crashworthy seat design is now receiving considerable attention. Design of aircraft seats for crash safety is a formidable task. Crashworthy seat design must be based on an understanding of seat stiff- ness (and natural frequency) in each primary direction, seat maximum strength, and the ability of the seat to absorb energy beyond the elastic limit (refs. Tl-13). In addition, a range of survivable airplane crash pulses must be considered each with velocity changes, dura- tions, deceleration rise times, and peak and average decelerations. Human occupants having different weight, height, body structure, resonances, age, and sex must be considered. Human seated acceleration tolerances (figure 1) depend on the direction of the deceleration, 4.438 0096-736X/86/9404-0438$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">850855 200p loo- &gt;j' ' Area of ' severe injury """rea"o7""^^^ in_ Area of voluntary human exposures A il i I I .001 .01 .1 1 Duration, sec (a) Vertical acceleration in headward direction. 2o°r 100- Area"of' m red or Area °f m red or Ss^ severe moderate injury injury Area of voluntary Acc G human exP°sure io- li 1 I 1 .001 .01 .1 1 Duration, sec (b) Longitudinal acceleration in rearward direction.

Reference 15 showed that human response resonances vary with position (figure 2), eg., whether sitting straight or slumped over. In addition to the intricacies of structural seat design, it is expected that the restraint system should be designed with lap belt and shoulder harnesses in the proper positions for effective restraint and with inertia reels for comfort and mobility. PROPOSED CRITERIA - A recent proposal to the FAA from the General Aviation Safety Panel (GASP) is to require dynamic testing of general aviation seats with input velocities ranging from 30 to 42 ft/s depending on the seat orien- tation with respect to the crash force vector and with peak accelerations from 19 to 26 G's reaching the peak value within .05 to .10 seconds. The proposed criteria for seat accept- ance includes the following: maximum pelvic lumbar load does not exceed 1500 lbs, the loads 2.5 r i2.Hz Amplification 1.5 - /' I ' (I""" ratio ' I ' 4 squared 1.0- 'l ' ļ Ol 1 1- l-U - ■ ■ v&gt;r - . 0 2 6 10 60 80 200 Frequency, Hz 'Í A ÈL S,ira,ion i-o- J' A i squared ' f 0I 1 - ■ i • i VNI ■ i ■ i 0 2 6 10 40 80 200 Frequency, Hz Fig. 2 - Variation of human resonance with seated position. in the individual restraining straps do not exceed 1700 lbs, the occupant's head does not exceed a HIC (Head Injury Criterion) of 1000 (ref. 16), and that upper torso restraint be used for all seats. This panel considers head impact to be the primary cause of death and estimates that the addition of shoulder har- nesses could reduce fatalities by 15 to 20 percent . AIRPLANE CRASH VERTICAL FLOOR ACCELERATION PULSES - Crash pulse data obtained from a series of general aviation crash tests performed at NASA Langley over the past 10 years (ref. 17) is available to the seat designer. Vertical floor accelerations from these general aviation crash tests are shown in figure 3. These crash pulses were selected from the results of crash tests at various impact parameters to investigate the effect of impact velocity on peak floor acceleration. A quadratic least squares curve was fitted through zero and the data (solid line) and shows that the peak acceleration is a function of the impact velocity squared. This curve is used to select a pulse within a desired velocity range for dynamic seat tests. Acceleration pulses from sled tests are usually triangular or half sine wave pulses. Their peak acceleration is readily defined. However, the acceleration time histories re- corded during airplane crash tests are more complex. They have multiple peaks and many high frequency vibrations superimposed on the traces. 4.439</page><page sequence="3">50 r ✓ o o/ ✓ 40- / ° ° / Peak 30- Cuadratic Accel, least squares fit G 20 - O 10- O ' I 1 I 1 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 AV, ft/ sec Fig. 3 - Relation between vertical acceleration and velocity change for general aviation crash tests. To be able to compare airplane crash tests with each other and with sled tests, a reduction of the data is necessary. For instance reference 17 formed the pulse data in figure 3 by digi- tally filtering the airplane floor accelerometer data to obtain the low frequency response (generally below 20Hz) , averaging over different floor locations, and by approximating the resulting pulse as triangular with respect to time. Another technique used in this report to interpret acceleration data is to compute the change in velocity over the duration of the main impact by integrating the acceleration trace. The average acceleration can then be computed by dividing the change in velocity by the pulse duration. Assuming a triangular pulse, the equivalent peak acceleration was obtained by multiplying the average acceleration by a factor of two. In most cases, digital filtering of the traces using a low pass filter of 20 Hz gave comparable peak values to computing the peak acceleration from twice the average acceleration . VERTICAL SEAT STIFFNESS AND NATURAL FREQUENCIES - The seated human resonances to vertical input (figure 2) fall very closely to the experimental vertical crash pulse frequencies. Figure 4 shows a plot of the vertical floor pulse frequency versus duration with the range of NASA crash test frequencies and the three seated human resonance frequencies shown on the curve. The 8 Hz resonance for a human in a braced (crash position) falls directly within the range. Since the seat is between the aircraft floor and the occupant, the seat's stiffness and natural frequency of response is very critical and should be tailored to minimize any high vertical loads and acceleration amplification. For a single half sine (or triangular) input acceleration pulse, theoretically the maximum amplification factor is less than two.

In figure 5, the ratio of the seat natural frequency to the airplane crash pulse frequency is plotted along the abscissa and the maximum amplification factor of the seat response (output) acceleration to the airplane (input) acceleration is plotted along the ordinate. Damping in the seat system decreases the amplification factor. In contrast, the dotted line indicates that the amplification can approach infinity for zero damping and multiple pulses. ENERGY ABSORBING SEAT CONCEPTS - This simplified analysis might lead one to design a seat with a lower natural frequency than the airplane crash pulse frequency to achieve an amplification factor less than one. However, this works only for very mild crashes. An initial low frequency (and thus stiffness) would require a very long stroking distance which is not readily available. A more practical ap- proach is to design a seat with a bilinear stiffness with the initial stiffness high (and with the seat to airplane frequency ratio high) 4.440</page><page sequence="4">850855 40 p 30 ~ ^^OÍAseat Seat ^ natural ~ frequency, Hz 20- Cfsheet metal seat i ■ » ■ i I I i I 0 40 80 120 160 200 Stiffness, K lb/ft Fig. 6 - Seat natural frequency vs. stiffness.

Figure 6 shows the relation of seat natural frequency to stiffness. Two points shown on the curve are the initial stiffness of a typical general aviation passenger seat with a sheet metal structure and the initial stiffness of a prototype energy absorbing seat. To calcu- late the seat natural frequency, 80 percent of the mass of a 50 percentile occupant (weight 165 lbs) is assumed to be associated with the seat in addition to the seat mass. Figure 7 illustrates properties of a typi- cal general aviation seat (left column) and an ideal EA seat (right column) . In a typical seat, the initial stiffness is low from a soft cushion in combination with a soft rubber or spring-fabric seat pan. In such a seat, the seat acceleration lags the floor acceleration until the occupant bottoms out the soft part of the seat and starts loading the metal structure; then the seat stiffness increases dramatically (as does the occupant acceleration) until the Fig. 8 - Seat specimens used in CAMI sled tests. structure fails. In contrast, an EA seat starts out with a high stiffness and essentially fol- lows the input airplane floor acceleration until the acceleration level exceeds a level within human tolerance (typically around 11 Gfs for the vertical direction) at which time the seat begins stroking holding the seat acceleration at a constant value (see, second figure on right). The velocity curves of the airplane and the seat for the two different cases are shown at the bottom of figure 7. The relative velocity between the typical seat and occupant becomes very large shortly after impact; whereas, for the EA seat the relative velocity is zero until the seat starts stroking. SEAT SPECIMENS Figure 8 illustrates seven seat specimens that were statically tested to failure at NASA Langley and then (identical seats) dynamically tested at the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) . The series of 7 general aviation aircraft seats included: (figure 8a) research- type energy absorbing passenger seat (NASA EA seat), 8b) private organization's EA seat (JAARS crew), 8c) private organization's seat (JAARS foam), 8d) commercially available seat con- structed of welded, hollow, round tubular material (round tubular), 8e) commercially available seat constructed of rectangular cross- section, hollow tubular material (rectangular tubular), 8f) commercial seat constructed of fiberglass/kevlar (composite), and 8g) commer- cial seat formed from cast aluminum alloy (cast). To identify each seat, the phrase or word in parentheses will be used for brevity. The NASA EA seat is composed of two four- bar linkages in parallel. The floor is the fixed bar, the seat pan is the top bar, and the front and rear legs are the other two bars forming the parallelogram (figure 9a). An energy absorber was attached on each side diagonally between the seat pan-rear leg joint 4.441</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 9 - Energy absorbing seat and wire bending energy absorber. and the floor-front leg joint. The energy absorber illustrated in figure 9b absorbs energy by bending a wire over rollers in a trolley. The trolley was attached to the pin at the intersection of the rear leg and the seat pan. During seat stroking, the wire loop was forced through three rollers in the trolley to provide a near constant force. Figure 10 shows six different types of seats that were used in the NASA full-scale crash tests. The A-frame type seat shown in figure 10a was used in the pilot and copilot positions for NASA test 15. The "sheet metal" construction seat in figure 10b was located in the first passenger position for NASA15 and NASA16, and in the 3rd passenger position for ŅASA8. The tubular construction seat in figure 10c was used in the pilot's position for tests NASA11, 12, and 13. Figure lOd shows a commer- cial "S-leg" seat (which absorbs energy by compressing the "s-shaped" legs) that was used in the copilot's position for tests NASA12 and 13. Figure 10e illustrates a seat with no rear legs that is supported by the main spar. This type of seat was used in the pilot's position for NASA tests 18, 19, and 21 and in the copilot's position for tests NASA18, 19, and 20. The seat in figure lOf was used in all passenger positions for NASA tests 18, 19, 20, and 21. Fig. 10 - Seat specimens used in general avia- tion crash tests. TEST METHODS STATIC TESTING - The static seat testing apparatus (figure 11) used at NASA Langley Research Center consists of an I-beam frame and two hydraulic rams which load the seat assembly through a wooden body block in either the horizontal or vertical directions. The hydraulic rams are attached to a horizontal bar that passes through the center of gravity of the body block. A constant load path is maintained by trolleys that ride on vertical and horizontal beams. The trolleys support the hydraulic rams and track the displacement of the seat assembly during seat stroking. Each ram is instrumented with a load cell to obtain a continuous record- ing of the applied load. To measure floor reaction forces, 6-axis load cells (3 moments plus triaxial forces) can be mounted under each seat leg. During testing the seat is mounted in tracks attached to the 6-axis load cells. The seat belt is tightened around the wooden body block and a hydraulic ram is activated to pull at a slow rate in the horizontal or vertical direction. To load the seat at an angle, a wedge floor under the load cells is used. A seat is normally tested to failure to determine its stiffness from its load-deflection curve. Weak components are readily identified in the static test. DYNAMIC TESTING - Data from three dynamic testing methods was used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of general aviation seats. Part of the data presented in this paper was obtained at the FAA's Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City. CAMI util- izes a sled propelled by the force of a dropping mass to achieve the desired velocity (ref. 18). The sled is arrested by wires stretched over rollers to produce the desired deceleration pulse. The CAMI method employs closely control- 4.442</page><page sequence="6">850855 Fig. 11 - Static seat testing apparatus. Fig. 12 - Cylinder drop test device.

The other two test methods, drop testing and full-scale aircraft crash tests, were employed at Langley Research Center. The drop test method (figure 12) used a heavy steel cylinder that was raised to a predetermined height to produce the desired impact velocity. The cylinder was dropped into a box filled with uniform microglass beads that resembled sand. Wedges were attached beneath the cylinder. Honeycomb blocks were positioned between the wedges and the cylinder and this combination, when impacted with the "sand" shaped the desired acceleration pulse. In the full-scale crash tests, the seats were installed in the general aviation airplanes which were crash tested (ref. 1) at predetermined impact conditions (Table 1). This "real world" test procedure is the best functional test of the seats; however, it is the most expensive and the most difficult to control and repeat. TEST RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS STATIC TESTS - Before dynamic testing of the series of 7 different general aviation seats at CAMI, the seats were statically tested to failure at NASA Langley with horizontal, verti- cal, and combined forces being applied. Figure 13 shows a typical failure of the seat leg, track attachment during a static test of the seat shown in figure 8e. Although useful infor- mation about weak components is obtained from static testing, static tests often produce confusing results due to interactions with the testing apparatus that do not occur with an impulsively loaded structure. Consequently, when setting up a static test one must consider the conditions that may occur in a dynamic impact where inertia plays a large role in aligning the structure along the direction of the acceleration vector. 4.443</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 13 - Failure of leg-track attachment for seat 8e in static test under horizontal load. 6000 1- f ' /-Experimental AA Jv ' sheet metal seat 4M0- ^Calculated EASe" / V Vertical 4M0- ft/ EASe" / load-Ib A i ' Aj /-Experimental 2000 " _0 / Energy absorber °0l~~2 3~ 4 5 6 7 Vertical disp-in. Fig. 14 - Static vertical load results for an EA seat and a general aviation seat of sheet metal construction. Static tests were found to be particularly useful in designing EA seats in which the seat is designed to collapse in a known, predictable manner. Figure 14 shows static test data for the NASA EA seat loaded in the vertical direc- tion along with calculated values for comparison. The calculated value of the load in each energy absorber (fig. 9b) is also plotted in figure 14. In addition, the experimental curve for a sheet metal construction general aviation seat (fig 10b) loaded vertically is also shown. Note that the sheet metal seat loads slowly at first and then reaches high force values before failure. In an actual dynamic test with a dummy occupant, the sheet metal seat would fail earlier due to rupture of the seat pan. In this static test, the seat was loaded evenly around the frame to prevent early seat pan failure. CAMI DYNAMIC TESTS - The dynamic sled pulse used for seat testing at CAMI represented a vertical impact with -34 degrees pitch and had a sled impact velocity of 42 ft/s, peak sled acceleration of 29 G , and a duration of .09 seconds. This test condition was selected based on the full-scale vertical crash pulse data of figure 3. The 42 ft/s vertical velocity change for present aircraft configurations is con- sidered to be a practical upper limit for general aviation seats. This test condition is more severe than the recommended General Aviation Safety Panel's dynamic vertical seat test pulse. For those seats with the lap belt normally attached to the aircraft floor, tests were run with the standard lap belt configura- tion and also run with the belt anchor position moved to the rear of the seat pan. Figure 15 shows CAMI post test damage. Some of the damage was severe with weld and brittle material failures causing the seats (illustrated in figure 15g-j) to completely separate from the track. The NASA EA, JAARS foam, and the JAARS crew seat showed no significant damage (figure 15b, c,e) . The NASA EA seat stroked well; however, the pelvis acceleration was higher than expected. Some interference may have occurred because the dummy's feet were taped in position. Also the force level was too high when the energy absorb- er stroked. The wire for this test was from a different manufacturer and had unexpected higher stiffness properties than the wire used in previous tests. The seat performed with better attenuation in several drop and full-scale crash tests conducted at NASA Langley (see Table II). To compare dummy responses from tests using the same dynamic pulse, various criteria have been developed. They include: measured anthropomorphic dummy peak accelerations, average accelerations, Dynamic Response Index (DRI) (ref. 19), Head Injury Criteria (HIC) (ref. 16), maximum belt loads, peak lumbar loads, and Severity Index (SI) (ref. 20). For the series of seat tests presented in Table II conducted at CAMI for NASA Langley, the peak pelvis acceleration, average pelvis accelera- 4.444</page><page sequence="8">850855 Fig. 15 - Damage to seats in CAMI sled tests. tion, peak lumbar load, ratio of average pelvis acceleration to the average input acceleration, and DRI were all computed. The peak pelvis acceleration was found to be a poor indicator of seat response and did not correlate well with other indicators. If the peak pelvis accelera- tion is very sharp (a few milliseconds duration), its effect may not be damaging due to its low energy and high frequency to which the seat and occupant may not respond. (This does not apply to the head which has low mass and is very sensitive to sharp accelerations) . The DRI model is intended to represent a seated occupant subject to a deceleration pulse and has been correlated by the Air Force to probability of spinal injury from ejection seat operational data (figure 16). The DRI is the maximum response acceleration of a damped, forced oscillator with approximately 8 Hz 4.445</page><page sequence="9">Table II - Summary of Vertical Floor Pulses and Dummy Response for CAMI Tests FLOOR FLOOR TWICE AVE TWICE AVE ACC VELOCITY PULSE PEAK PELVIS FLOOR PELVIS RATIO CHANGE FREQUENCY LUMBAR LOAD TEST SEAT PEAK ACC ACC ACC PEL/FLR DRI FT/S HZ LBF G G G CAMI A82-022 NASA-EA 45.00 28.80 34.40 1.19 30.80 36.00 6.30 1240.00 CAMI A83-004 JAARS CREW 36.00 26.00 32.80 1.26 34.10 36.00 6.00 1450.00 CAMI A8 3-006 JAARS FOAM 54.00 26.00 37.20 1.43 44.03 36.00 6.00 1780.00 CAMI A82-023 RND TUBE-BELT SEAT 68.00 26.10 42.76 1.64 43.40 36.00 6.00 2040.00 CAMI A83-002 RECT TUBE-BELT FLOOR 52.00 26.00 42.80 1.65 41.72 36.00 6.00 2350.00 CAMI A8 3-001 RND TUBE-BELT FLOOR 136.00 26.00 45.60 1.75 52.00 36.00 6.00 3000.00 CAMI A-83-003 CAST-BELT FLOOR 100.00 26.00 47.20 1.82 47.72 36.00 6.00 4000.00 CAMI A83-007 JAARS PASSENGER 51.00 26.00 47.60 1.83 50.12 36.00 6.00 2400.00 CAMI A82-024 RECT TUBE-BELT SEAT 65.00 26.00 48.10 1.85 42.80 36.00 6.00 2480.00 CAMI A82-026 COMPOSITE 51.00 24.20 49.00 2.02 48.20 36.00 6.00 3120.00 CAMI A8 2-025 CAST-BELT SEAT 98.00 26.20 56.20 2.15 56.80 36.00 6.00 3680.00 50 r / / / / 30 ~ / / / / Spinal 10 " / / injury - / f rate, 2 _ / / percent 2 _ / / / / 7 / / Operational data Cadaver data 0 . i « i « i « 10 14 18 22 Dynamic response index Fig, 16 - Probability of spinal injury vs. the Dynamic Response Index (reference 13) . natural frequency. The peak pelvis acceleration does not correlate well with the DRI (Table II). However, twice the average pelvis acceleration correlates reasonably well (See figure 17a). The peak lumbar load is presently con- sidered to be a very good indicator of the severity of the impact on the spinal column. Based on the lumbar load measurements, the NASA EA seat performed best by limiting the peak lumbar load to 1240 lbs. The cast seat had the highest peak lumbar loads which ranged from 3000 to 4000 lbs for the pulse studied. Only two of the seats tested had loads below the maximum suggested limit of 1500 pounds proposed by the GASP panel- the NASA EA seat and the JAARS crew seat.

Both round tubular seats failed completely at the welds, the rectangular tubular failed at the attachment claws, and the cast seat with the belt attached to the floor failed in the seat frame. These seat failures should be kept in mind when inter- preting peak lumbar load data. Considering the simplicity of the JAARS foam seat (structural foam with a plate of sheet metal covering it for load distribution), it did remarkably well based on the peak lumbar load. The DRI (figure 17b) correlated reasonably well with the peak lumbar load for these tests as a criterion for judging seat performance. However, the average pelvis acceleration and the amplification ratio of average pelvis accelera- tion to average floor acceleration (figure 18) correlated slightly better. Using the amplification ratio as the criteria for com- parison, the seats ranked about the same as they did using lumbar load. The exception was the cast seat test (CAMI A83-003) which rank lower when using peak lumbar load as the criteria. 2,4 r 2 o ~ n _°S-- - - Ēf'" 1.6- ^ Least squares fit Amplification ^ ■ - ^ ratio 1.2 - □ D 0.8- 0.4- » i i i i i 0 1600 2400 3200 4000 Peak lumbar load , ft/ sec Fig. 18 - Pelvis to floor acceleration ratio vs. lumbar load in CAMI tests. NASA FULL SCALE CRASH TESTS - NASA Langley has conducted a series of full-scale crash tests utilizing general aviation aircraft (Table I). In these tests many types of seat failures have been observed. Serious failures have occurred at the seat tracks and seat leg, track attach- ment for high combined loading conditions of vertical and horizontal accelerations. Also seat legs have "punched through" the track where there is weak supporting structure beneath the track (see figure 19a). This type of failure would not be observed in a CAMI test where a strong floor is used. Also, when restraints such as the shoulder harness are attached to the fuselage structure (or the lap belts are at- tached to the floor), care must be exercised to assure that very little relative motion will occur between the attachment point and the seat. Otherwise if the seat crushes or the fuselage at the attachment point deforms, the occupant which Fig. 19 - Damage to seats in general aviation crash tests. is restrained between the two will be subjected to either very high belt loads or slack in the belts (see figure 19b). The problem can be avoided by having all restraints attached to the seat structure. Many seat pan failures have been observed for crashes with moderate vertical deceleration (see figure 19c). The upholstery and rubber pan was found to fail prematurely, allowing the occupant pelvis to break through and strike the inner seat frame members. In addition rubber diaphragms and foams have been noted to show deterioration with time. A simple modification was made by replacing the rubber diaphragm seat pan with .032 aluminum sheet. These modified seats were tested and were found to perform well with the lower structure crushing but remaining intact (figure 19d). Figure 19e shows a lap belt buckle that opened during a crash test that had previously passed stringent static testing. Also noticed during the analysis of interior crash movies was a failure of the inertia reel latch to catch which allowed the occupant's head to impact the instrument panel.

However, in the crash test the front legs deformed allowing the seat to move forward, which is undesirable for a crew seat. Lumbar load cells were not available for the NASA full-scale crash tests. Consequently, to compare vertical dummy response only peak and average acceleration values plus the computed DRI values are considered (Table III) . Since the vertical velocity change is a critical parameter, the DRI and average pelvis accelera- tion for the pilots was plotted versus the vertical velocity change in figure 20. In figure 21, the DRI and pelvis acceleration for all occupants were plotted versus velocity change.

NASA CYLINDER DROP TESTS - The NASA steel cylinder was used for initial dynamic testing of the NASA EA seat. The cylinder was raised to a height of approximately 27 feet to achieve a 42 ft/s impact velocity into a box containing sand (microglass beads) . The wire bending energy absorbers in the seat were tuned to begin strok- ing when each reached a force level of approximately 900 pounds. Table III and Figure 22 show results from one test conducted at 42 ft/s impact velocity with 0 degree pitch. The top photograph shows the set-up before the test and the lower post test photograph shows the seat partially stroked. The unfiltered vertical floor accelerations and the digitally filtered floor accelerations using a 20 Hz low pass filter are shown in the first plot at the top right of the figure. The floor acceleration (20 Hz filter) peaked at 37 Głs with a pulse dura- tion of .07 seconds. The seat vertical acceleration measured at the seat pan and fil- tered at 20 Hz peaked at less than half the Fig. 22 - Cylinder drop test of NASA energy absorbing seat and resulting accelerations. input peak (about 17 Gfs), is fairly flat and extends the deceleration duration to .10 seconds. The seat pulse superimposed on the floor pulse is shown in the third plot. The relative magnitude and duration of the pulses can readily be seen. The ratio of amplification factor (ratio of average pelvis acceleration to the average floor acceleration) is only .52 for this moderately severe impact. The DRI was computed to be 22.5 which corresponds from air force ejection data to approximately a 35 per cent chance of some spinal injury (figure 16). CONCLUDING REMARKS Designing aircraft seats for crash safety is a formidable task. However, information from research programs and developing criteria is now available. Static testing is important for finding weak components of a seating system, but dynamic testing should be used to simulate the real crash environment. NASA general aircraft crash testing has given the designer a data base of operational crash acceleration pulses for various airplanes under various survivable crash conditions. Adequate upper torso restraints should be used to protect occupants against head strike, a major cause of injury and death. Deformation of the seat or fuselage structure to which the belts are anchored can cause the restraint to lose effectiveness. If possible, all restraints should be attached to the seat using proper geometry to secure the occupant in place and to avoid compressive loading of the spine. The vertical crash deceleration is impor- tant to general aviation seat designers as it can often be the highest acceleration and the dictating factor in seat design. In addition the situation is aggravated by seated human vertical resonances which fall within the verti- cal crash pulse envelope determined at NASA 4.449</page><page sequence="13">Langley, and by the fact that the spine is more vulnerable to loading in the vertical than in the longitudinal direction. New designs which allow the seat to deform vertically in a con- trolled manner could help lower the vertical acceleration experienced by an occupant in a crash situation. Some features found in older seats that affect crash behavior should be avoided. For example, weak seat pans composed of springs, fabric, or rubber diaphragms should be replaced in newer designs with sheet metal or other structural material strong enough to withstand the crash load. Cushions should be comfortable, but should allow very little additional vertical movement beyond the comfort zone. Additional stiffness beyond the comfort zone of the seat should be large, to prevent the occupant from building up velocity with respect to the seat in the event of a crash and should be constructed of materials that do not deteriorate with time. Seat legs, claws, and tracks should be strengthened and the floor beneath the track should be adequately supported to retain the seat on the floor and to prevent vertical ac- celeration from pushing the legs through the track. Brittle and cast materials should be avoided particularly in the legs and other high load carrying members. Welds should be prevented from weakening the structure. Energy absorbing legs or structure capable of controlled load deformation should be used whenever possible. Deformation well beyond the elastic limit is needed to absorb a maximum of the crash energy. Materials that readily deteriorate or require frequent maintenance should be avoided. To compare dummy response and assess seat performance, lumbar load cells should be used in crash dummies when possible as they provide a direct peak load measurement that is relatively easy to interpret. Multiple peak accelerations are often confusing and must be filtered and analyzed with caution. Twice the average pelvis acceleration of the main pelvis acceleration pulse has been found to correlate well with the DRI for many cases. Also, the ratio of the average pelvis acceleration to the average floor pulse acceleration has been found to be a good indicator of seat performance. REFERENCES 1.
