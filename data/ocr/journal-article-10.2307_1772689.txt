<plain_text><page sequence="1">Interpretations: Data or Goals? Jonathan Culler Comparative Literature, Cornell One way to think about intellectual activities and disciplines is to in- quire about the organization of knowledge, to ask what counts as knowledge in a particular domain-and indeed the history of disci- plines is in large measure a history of the organization of knowledge, as Michel Foucault's archeology suggests. From this perspective, it seems evident that there have been significant changes in the field of literary criticism in the twentieth century in the United States. In the earlier part of the century one might have distinguished a realm of taste and a realm of knowledge: the first the domain of public critics; the second that of scholars in the university, where knowledge con- sisted of historical and philological information of various sorts. In the 1930s and 1940s, as the New Criticism began to invade the universi- ties, the single most common argument against its approach was that what the New Critics wrote did not count as knowledge but was simply an exercise of ingenuity at the expense of authors and their works. In his famous MLA Presidential address of 1948, "The New Criticism: Some Old-Fashioned Queries," Douglas Bush accused New Critics of inventing "unhistorical theories" and reading "modern attitudes and ideas into the past": "when complexity and ambiguity have become a fetish, there seems to be no check on interpretive irresponsibility ex- cept the limits of the critic's fancy"(1949: 138-150). Arthur Mizener, a New Critic fired by Yale in 1940, reports a senior colleague asking "Do you think that a scholar, who is committed to the ideal of objec- Poetics Today 9:2 (1988).

(Kunitz 1955: 679) The success of the New Criticism, however-first as a pedagogi- cal technique, second as a way of talking about refractory modern- ist poetry-brought a shift in what counted as knowledge. Formerly the distinction between scholarship and criticism had divided genuine knowledge from subjective evaluation or ingenious interpretation but this began to change as supporters of the New Criticism such as Rene Wellek, deeply versed in literary history and scholarship, sought to persuade their colleagues that, on the contrary, the products of schol- arly inquiry counted as genuine knowledge of literature only when they contributed to the task of interpretation.' Chapter six of Wellek and Warren's Theory of Literature, entitled "The Ordering and Estab- lishment of Evidence," illustrates vividly the transformation of literary studies that was underway. "One of the first tasks of scholarship," Wellek begins, is the assembly of its materials, the careful undoing of the effects of time, the examination as to authorship, authenticity, and date. Enormous acu- men and diligence have gone into the solution of these problems; yet the literary student will have to realize that these labours are preliminary to the ultimate task of scholarship. Often the importance of these operations is particularly great, since without them critical analysis and historical under- standing would be hopelessly handicapped. This is true in the case of a half-buried literary tradition such as that of Anglo-Saxon literature; but for the student of most modern literatures, concerned with the literary mean- ing of the works, the importance of these studies should not be overrated. (1956: 57) Although in theory these "Preliminary Operations," as the title of Theory of Literature's Part Two calls them, are preliminary both to criti- cal analysis and to historical explanation, Wellek's formulations here suggest that concern with the meaning of works is the appropriate fo- cus of the student of literature and that historical and textual scholar- ship is important insofar as it contributes to critical understanding. The concessions to "extrinsic approaches to the study of literature" are frequently framed in these terms: "Nobody can deny that much light has been thrown on literature by a proper knowledge of the conditions under which it has been produced," Wellek and Warren declare; "the exegetical value of such a study seems indubitable. Yet it is clear that 1. The conflicts between scholarship and criticism can be followed in MLA presi- dential addresses, published annually in PMLA. Two early instances occur in the addresses of 1929 and 1930 (PMLA 44 &amp; 45). For useful discussion, see Grant Webster, The Republic of Letters (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979), especially pp. 113-19; and Gerald Graff, Professing Literature: An Institutional His- tory (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), chapters 8-11.</page><page sequence="3">Culler * Data or Goals? 277 causal study can never dispose of problems of description, analysis, and evaluation of an object such as a work of literary art" (1956: 93). On the one hand, extrinsic approaches are supposed to have a special purpose of their own, causal explanation; but on the other hand when extrinsic scholarship is praised for its indubitable exegetical value, the game seems to have been given to interpretation. Extrinsic approaches are seen as providing mere information, which becomes knowledge only when relevant to the interpretation of the work itself. More spe- cifically, for example, proscription of the intentional fallacy did not in itself make biographical investigation a marginal activity; that happens when the principle that questions about meaning are not resolved by investigation of the author is joined to the presumption that elucida- tion of the meaning of a work is the goal of critical activity. With this shift, interpretation-one's own interpretations of literary works and familiarity with prior interpretations-became the central concern of literary studies. In effect, the New Criticism created a new type of knowledge: to produce interpretations of poems is to make a con- tribution to knowledge; and periodicals such as The Explicator were founded precisely to record this knowledge. The scholar could even be attacked precisely for lacking the relevant knowledge, as in Cleanth Brooks's complaint that the scholar "has little or no knowledge of the inner structure of a poem or drama ... he is ignorant of its architec- ture; in short, he often does not know how to read" (1940: 405). Since the 1950's, one might say, the test of scholarly endeavors seems to have become their contribution to critical interpretation.2 Indeed, here is where the New Criticism's greatest triumph oc- curred. The most widespread legacy of the New Criticism is the assumption, which to a considerable extent still holds sway, that the test of any critical activity-including textual criticism and historical scholarship-is whether it helps us to produce richer, more compel- ling interpretations of particular literary works. We are now beginning to see some changes in this configuration of knowledge. In particu- lar, during the last few years understanding of a range of difficult theoretical discourses has come to count as knowledge in the domain of criticism. Literature departments increasingly expect such knowl- edge of new Ph.D.s they hire. But for the most part, these theoretical 2. The result, however, seems to have been a curious overlay. While scholarship is deemed relevant to the extent that it contributes to criticism, nevertheless the field of literary studies remains organized, for the most part, according to the his- torical periods identified by traditional scholarship. These persistent institutional arrangements exert considerable pressure on criticism, encouraging teachers to engage in historical projects and substantially modifying the triumph of the New Criticism, which nevertheless persists in the assumption that interpretations are the goals of literary study and literary research.</page><page sequence="4">278 Poetics Today 9:2 discourses are seen as critical approaches and thus as methods of inter- pretation, so that the notion of interpretation or interpretations as the goal of literary studies remains very strong. And post-structuralist theory, maintaining that theoretical frameworks or metalinguistic dis- courses are simply further interpretations, has if anything strength- ened the presumption that interpretations are what we seek to pro- duce. Deconstruction, precisely because it can be taken as a method of interpretation, has succeeded in America in ways that structuralism and Marxism, which urged other sorts of critical projects, never did.3 This state of affairs seems peculiar to literary studies and we might well expect, in a conference on interpretation and knowledge, that comparisons with other disciplines would illuminate its situation. The practitioners of other disciplines in the humanities interpret, of course, but frequently they are interpreting data to explain something else: anthropologists interpret information about the behavior of a group to work out the system of categories through which it makes sense of the world; historians interpret documents and other information to reconstruct the political forces of a period and determine why things happened as they did. Now one could say straight away that one would not wish literary criticism to adopt this model-at least as I have de- scribed it: one of the signal virtues of literary criticism is that it does not deem its texts to be simply data about something else. If we study literature, it is because literary works and their complexities are of in- terest in themselves. The question of whether interpretation is, then, necessarily the goal seems to me to have been raised in a pertinent way by the mutual incomprehension that arises when linguists and literary critics seek to cooperate, as they frequently did in the 1960s and 1970s, when the generic dialogue ran something like this: Critic: So how can linguistics help us with this poem? Linguist: What do you want to do? Critic: To understand it. Linguists find it hard to help because linguistics does not provide new interpretations of English sentences. Rather the interpretations of na- tive speakers are data it seeks to explain. This, of course, is the model of a poetics or semiotics seeking to understand the processes of literary signification, but in American literary studies at least, the interpretive teleology has been so strong that any attempt at poetics is immedi- ately treated as a method of interpretation. Northrop Frye's ambitious Anatomy was scarcely ignored but led to-what?-myth criticism. The justification most frequently offered when one criticizes this result is 3. For further discussion of these issues see the opening chapter, optimistically entitled "Beyond Interpretation," of Jonathan Culler, The Pursuit of Signs (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1981).</page><page sequence="5">Culler * Data or Goals? 279 that to describe works at all is to interpret them, so that any incipient poetics becomes a practice of interpretation, especially as it attends to how works outplay the categories and conventions to which one seeks to attribute their meaning. In the past I have sought to challenge the primacy of interpretation without much success-particularly in an essay optimistically entitled "Beyond Interpretation"-by discussing the issue theoretically. Here I would like to attempt another approach, exploring the possible rela- tionships between making interpretations one's data and interpreta- tion one's goal by engaging interpretation and interpretations directly. Can one interpret a poem without making interpretation the over- riding goal? My text is a poem much interpreted in discussions of Baudelaire and the modern poetic tradition-a poem whose conflicting interpre- tations provide data for reflecting on the stakes of literary interpre- tation and the conceptions of poetic language and poetic structure on which conceptions of literary history and the practice of reading rely. Baudelaire's "Correspondances" has frequently been treated as a central document for the study of his poetics. Jean Pommier used it as the key to La Mystique de Baudelaire. Cherix's Commentaire des Fleurs du Mal identifies it as "la piece maitresse de la doctrine esthetique de Baudelaire" and Lloyd Austin's L'Univers poetique de Baudelaire "takes as its point of departure the doctrine of correspondences. The best Baudelairiens have not failed to grant a capital importance to the set of theories that Baudelaire constituted around this word" (1956: 51). Correspondances La Nature est un temple oi de vivants piliers Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles; L'homme y passe a travers de forets de symboles Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers. Comme de longs echos qui de loin se confondent Dans une tenebreuse et profonde unite Vaste comme la nuit et comme la clarte, Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se repondent. II est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants, Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies, -Et d'autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants, Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies, Comme l'ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens, Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens. [Nature is a temple where living pillars Sometimes let emerge confused words; Man passes there through forests of symbols Which observe him with familiar looks.</page><page sequence="6">280 Poetics Today 9:2 Like long echoes which from far merge In a shadowy and profound unity, As vast as night and as luminosity, Smells, colors, and sounds answer each other. There are smells which are fresh like babies' skin, Soft like oboes, green like meadows, -And others, corrupt, rich, triumphant, With the expansion of things infinite, Like amber, musk, benjamin, incense, Which sing the transports of the mind and senses.] In undertaking a reading of this poem, I am interested in eluci- dating the stakes of readings, the assumptions and investments of the multifarious discussions of this poem and the methodological issues they raise. The two ground rules I set myself are, first, not to hold back from interpretation but to propose alternative readings as corrections or supplements to the interpretations of others-providing the best interpretations I can-and second, to take my own interpretations as data as well, even though structurally I cannot account for them. A good deal of the scholarly energy devoted to this poem has worked to constitute an intertextual space for it that includes passages from Swedenborg, Schelling, Mme de Stael, Hoffmann, Balzac, Es- quiros, Sainte-Beuve, Constant, and Gautier, not to mention Hugo and Lamartine. The first quatrain in particular, is seen as echoing a romantic topos: the visible forms of the universe are signs of an invisible spiritual reality. Citing texts which Baudelaire might have seen prior to 1846, Antoine Adam concludes, with a declaration in which he no doubt failed to see the humor, that "Le poete des Fleurs du Mal ne pouvait donc ignorer, des cette epoque, l'idee qui forme le premier movement de son sonnet" (1961: 271). [The poet of the Fleurs du Mal therefore could not have been ignorant at this time of the idea that forms the first movement of his sonnet.] This is the idea of vertical correspondence: relations between material signifiers and spiritual signifieds or what Baudelaire calls "cet admirable, cet immor- tel instinct du Beau qui nous fait considerer la terre et ses spectacles comme un aper;u, comme une correspondance du Ciel" (1975: II, 334) [this admirable, immortal instinct of beauty, which makes us con- sider the earth and its spectacles as a glimpse or correspondence of heaven]. Interpretations adduce parallels to the poem's opening statement, "La nature est un temple," from Hugo and Lamartine for instance. Here is Hugo: C'est Dieu qui remplit tout. Le monde, c'est son temple. Oeuvre vivante, oiu tout l'ecoute et le contemple! Tout lui parle et le chante. (1972: 345)</page><page sequence="7">Culler * Data or Goals? 281 Here is Lamartine: Dieu cache, disais tu, la, nature est ton temple! L'esprit te voit partout quand notre oeil la contemple. (1968: 20) And again: L'univers est le temple, et la terre est l'autel. Mais ce temple est sans voix. Ou sont les saints concerts? Tout se tait: mon coeur seul parle dans ce silence. La voix de l'univers, c'est mon intelligence. (1968: 68-69) Correspondances echoes these passages but there is a question about the meaning of such echoes or correspondences, which can be taken as reiteration and affirmation or as ironic repetition. In Baudelaire's tem- ple, living pillars-are these people or trees?-"laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles." It is as though in compromising between Hugo's version, in which everything speaks and sings, and Lamartine's ver- sion, where "Tout se tait," Baudelaire had let things speak sometimes, giving us, if not a compromise that parodies the alternatives, at least an undermining of the continuous, authoritative signifying relation that seemed the basis of any doctrine of correspondences. The symbolic relation is confused and intermittent, and while com- mentators identify here as the underlying image Chateaubriand's com- parison of the forest to a cathedral, it is not clear that we are in fact in a forest: we are told that man passes not through forests that are sym- bolic but through "des forets de symboles," forests of symbols. "Forest" may be a figure not of spirituality but of enumeration and confu- sion (in the "Salon de 1859" Baudelaire evokes the possibility of being "perdu dans une foret d'originalites" [lost in a forest of originalities]) (1975: II, 608). Interpretations focusing on the first stanza have generally empha- sized the forceful articulation of a doctrine of vertical correspon- dences, though the intermittent symbolic relation raises enough ques- tions to suggest that this reading may owe a good deal to the premise of continuity that sustains source-hunting. In recent years, however, readings of the sonnet have shifted attention from the vertical corre- spondences to the so-called horizontal correspondences of the remain- ing quatrain and tercets. Leo Bersani's Baudelaire and Freud provides a vigorous example. Readers of this poem have frequently been misled by the reference to Na- ture as containing "forests of symbols" in the first stanza. This presumably refers to a system of vertical correspondences: the "temple" of Nature is replete with symbols of spiritual reality. In fact, the metaphysical sugges- tiveness of the first four verses is simply dropped in the second and third</page><page sequence="8">282 Poetics Today 9:2 stanzas. We move from vertical transcendence to horizontal "unity." "Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se repondent": that is, stimuli ordinarily associated with one of our senses can produce sensations "belonging" to another sense. Baudelaire asserts, and in the third stanza illustrates, the reality of these analogies (certain perfumes, for example, are "green as fields"). "Correspondances" does present itself as a doctrinaire poem (thus the countless critical efforts to extract the doctrine, to find its sources in nineteenth-century esthetics, philosophy, and psychology), and the doctrine which the poem espouses and vaguely outlines has much less to do with symbolism in Nature than with a metaphorical unity within Nature. Com- parisons using the word comme occur six times in the two middle stanzas, and we might think of this as a stylistic demonstration of those "echoes" of a distant likeness which the poet asks us to hear in each of our experiences. (1977: 32) Baudelaire's notion of a "keyboard of correspondences" suggests that the poet's task might be to construct melodies out of the meta- phorical equivalents between sensations of various sorts. The last four lines move from tropes that relate one sensory experience to another to the more general claim that certain sensations effect a spiritualiza- tion, that they explicitly thematize the movement beyond sense sug- gested by synesthesias: they "chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens. We have here, it seems, a notable poetic adumbration of a symbolist aesthetics but such a reading of this "doctrinaire poem" depends on an understanding of another set of intertextual relations, correspon- dences between the verse text and various prose texts which it echoes: the theoretical statements about analogies, correspondences, colors, smells and sounds, etc. Here a problem arises. Antoine Adam writes, I1 est notable, pourtant, que s'il existe un texte de Baudelaire qui offre des analogies de pensee et d'expression avec le sonnet, c'est bien moins le Salon de 1846 que l'article sur L'Exposition Universelle de 1855. Le mot de correspondance s'y trouve, et dans une phrase qui est comme le commentaire du sonnet: le professeur d'esthetique est un barbare "qui a oublie la couleur du ciel, la forme du vegetal, le mouvement et l'odeur de l'animalite, et dont les doigts crispes, paralyses par la plume, ne peuvent plus courir avec agilite sur l'immense clavier des correspondances." (1961: 272) [It is striking, though, that if there exists a text by Baudelaire that offers analogies of thought and expression with the sonnet, it is less the Salon de 1846 than the article on the Exposition Universelle de 1855. The word correspondance appears there and in a sentence that is like a commentary on the sonnet: the professor of aesthetics is a barbarian "who has forgotten the color of the sky, the form of the vegetal, the movement and scent of animality and whose clenched fingers, paralyzed by the pen, can no longer play with agility on the immense keyboard of correspondences."] One might note the initial complication that the passage of aesthetic writing which Adam calls "comme le commentaire du sonnet" is about</page><page sequence="9">Culler * Data or Goals? 283 the inability of a professeur d'esthetique to play with and appreciate correspondences. When the piece of aesthetic writing that offers the best "analogie de pensee et d'expression avec le sonnet" concerns the incompatibility of works of art and aesthetic doctrine, this at least raises a question about the relation of correspondence critics must take for granted in discussing a doctrine of correspondences. The prose text continues more explicitly to address this question. Tout le monde concoit sans peine que si les hommes charges d'exprimer le beau se conformaient aux regles des professeurs-jures, le beau lui-meme disparaitrait de la terre, puisque tous les types, toutes les idees, toutes les sensations se confondraient dans une vaste unite, monotone et imperson- nelle, immense comme l'ennui et le neant. (1975: 578) [Everyone easily conceives that if the men charged with expressing the beautiful obeyed the rules of the professor-judges, beauty itself would dis- appear from the earth, since all types, all ideas, all sensations, would blend in a vast unity, monotonous and impersonal, as immense as boredom and nothingness.] There are striking echoes here. Prose Poem Se confondrait se confondent, dans une vaste unite dans une tenebreuse et profonde unite vaste unite, immense unite vaste comme la nuit comme l'ennui There is an exchange of letters involved (I'ennui, la nuit), if not a cor- respondence. Antoine Adam declares categorically that "la tenebreuse et profonde unite of which the sonnet speaks is unrelated to (sans rapport avec) the monotone et impersonnelle unity of which the article on the Exposition universelle speaks" (1961: 276). The critic's position here is not an altogether comfortable one. At stake for Adam is the doctrine of correspondences, which he seeks to maintain by denying the correspondence between these passages: "He believes in the metaphysical reality of correspondences in the firmest way, and it is inconceivable that one could maintain the contrary" (Ibid.: 275). One could, however, maintain the inconceivable posi- tion, contesting the absolute firmness of Baudelaire's commitment to the metaphysical doctrine, by exploiting the correspondence between these texts, insisting on the relevance to one another of the echoing descriptions of unity. In both Baudelaire's prose text and his poem, for instance, unity results from the failure to distinguish: professors have forgotten the distinctiveness of each thing and thus everything is confused in this vast monotonous unity. In the poem, echoes heard from afar blend into a unity-vaste comme la nuit et comme la clart--a nuit, perhaps, ou</page><page sequence="10">284 Poetics Today 9:2 tous les chats sont noir (night and luminosity share the property of mak- ing it difficult to distinguish). Nor are these texts exceptional. "De la couleur" in the Salon of 1846, which cites Hoffmann on correspon- dences and celebrates vibration of color, describes the unity of nature like this: "et comme la vapeur de la saison,-hiver ou ete,-baigne, adoucit, ou engloutit les contours, la nature ressemble a un tonton qui, mu par une vitesse acceleree, nous apparait gris, bien qu'il resume en lui toutes les couleurs" (1975: II, 423). [And since the vapor of the season-winter or summer-bathes, softens or engulfs all contours, nature resembles a top which, spinning swiftly, appears to us gray, although it has all the colors on it.] Unity is the result of confusion, the effacement of difference. Generally, every description of unity is based on tropes that suppress difference and this creates a certain am- bivalence, as the alternation of values between these corresponding texts shows. A reading treating unity as a tropological product would doubtless go on to examine what is asserted in the tercets: first, the ability of cer- tain stimuli to evoke sensations belonging to other senses and second the indeterminate signifying possibilities of certain "parfums." The poem links synthesia with verbal art by asserting links between sensa- tions that seem to rely on verbal echoes or relays, whether semantic or phonological: chairs connects with doux by a pun that is close to the surface in chairs d'enfants ("cheres enfants"); the bois of hautbois helps to justify verts, in verts comme des prairies, where verts itself is echoed in the first syllable of prairies. I1 est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants, Doux comme les hautbois, verts commes les prairies.... But the tercets also distinguish the regular, specifiable relations be- tween sweet or innocent smells and the corresponding sounds and colors from the indeterminate signifying possibilities of corrupt, rich and triumphant smells. Why smells, one wants to know? If the point is, as Leo Bersani claimed in the passage I quoted earlier, to assert the metaphorical unity of the universe, to present a stylistic demonstration of "the echoes of a distant likeness which the poet asks us to hear in each of our experiences," why should smells have been selected as the case in point? The answer might be that of all sensations smells are the most inextricably linked with tropological, specifically metonymical opera- tions. Other sensations may have literal names. Smells mnemonically generate chains of metonymical associations: to name a smell is to metonymially describe its cause or the circumstances in which one first smelled it (unlike colors, which have names of their own), so that smells hold the attention to reorient it toward what surrounds them,</page><page sequence="11">Culler * Data or Goals? 285 in the poetic (discursive and descriptive) movement evoked in Baude- laire's "Parfum exotique" or "La Chevelure" or the prose poem, "Une hemisphere dans une chevelure." Smell is the sensation where il n'y a pas de propre and which joins the mnemonic power of recognition to the discursive exfoliation of a metonymical imagination. I have here outlined two kinds of intertextual explorations whose methodological compatibility should not be taken for granted but which do, taken together, generate a plausible reading of the poem. The first placed the sonnet in the intertextual space of possible sources, a persistent prior discourse about nature and temples, and sought to treat the poem either as an affirmation or as an ironic repetition or transformation of this language. If one feels no loyalty to the doctrine of vertical correspondences and thinks that lyric poetry can better be explained and justified in other ways, then one will no doubt find the second, ironic possibility more attractive and productive, since taking the poem to undermine the transcendental claims it cites and modifies prepares the way for the second quatrain. The second approach (for the second quatrain), emphasizing verbal echoes or repetitions within the Baudelairian corpus, sought to make the so-called doctrine of horizontal correspondences more textual and tropological. Bringing thematically distinct texts closer to each other, suggesting that in their repetition they infect one another, showing that unity might be viewed as a tropological effect, foregrounding the ambiguity of "se confondent," one reinstated "Correspondance" as an art poetique. Combining these procedures, which seem to work in different direc- tions and on different principles, nevertheless generates a reading of the poem, according to which the ironic treatment of doctrines in the first two quatrains sets the stage for the assertion of tropological rela- tions in the tercets. These assertions are cast in terms that suggest, on the one hand, that supposedly natural or inherent equivalences of sensory qualities may depend on verbal links and second, that what is most valued is the process (epitomized by smell) of metonymical ex- trapolation from sensation-quite literal "transports de l'esprit et des sens." "Correspondances," often thought to declare that the natural is a sign of the divine, by this reading in fact celebrates the poetic process whereby the smell of hair evokes or generates a hemisphere. Briefly and schematically, the various interpretations suggest that "Correspondances" has been an important poem for three reasons. First, because its definition of our encounter with the world as a pas- sage through "des forets de symboles" has seemed aesthetically pro- ductive: the world as a forest of signs accessible to poets and vision- aries. "Correspondances" seems to be the economical enunciation of principles of aesthetic signification at work in Baudelaire's oeuvre, as</page><page sequence="12">286 Poetics Today 9:2 it explores correspondences between le mal and la beaute or la boue et I'or, for example. Second, the poem is important because it echoes numerous state- ments of Baudelaire's prose writings-about correspondances, analogie universelle-and in so doing works to confirm the possibility of a corre- spondence between poems and prose accounts of aesthetic principles. If critics make much of "Correspondances," it is partly because criti- cism relies on the possibility of a correspondence between poems and poetics. As a poem based on what Lloyd Austin calls the "doctrine of correspondences," "Correspondances" confirms the vital possibility of a close, signifying relation between poems and critical statements. Third, "Correspondances" is essential to any attempt to situate Baudelaire in a story of modern poetry because of its echoes of a range of romantic sources, not to speak of the echoes of it in the later poetic tradition. Marcel Raymond, for example, makes it the point of departure for the trajectory summed up by his title, De Baudelaire au surrealisme. More recently, in an essay entitled "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, Paul de Man declares of "Correspondances" that "it, and it alone, contains, implies, produces, generates, permits (or whatever aberrant verbal metaphor one wishes to choose) the entire possibility of the lyric" (1984: 261-2). What seems to be at stake in all these interpretive possibilities is the preservation of "Correspondances" as a key, doctrinal poem: both a Baudelairian art poetique and a key poem for any literary history that wants to integrate Baudelaire in a story of post-Enlightenment poetry. Even contradictory interpretations seem to leave intact the no- tion of "Correspondances" as at once the culmination of the Romantic doctrine of vertical correspondences, the adumbration of a symbolist aesthetic, and the point of departure for surrealism. The poem, that is, brings about a change of direction, echoing romantic doctrine but, with an ironic twist, sending things off in a new direction; through its ironic repetition, making correspondence no longer a one-to-one divinely sanctioned relation but rather a metonymical exfoliation such as is set off by the recognition of a smell. The romantic line runs into this poem; the modernist line runs out of it. The change from one line to another takes place at the Baudelaire correspondence. These interpretive convergences, the very plausibility of a synthetic interpretive overview that transcends major disagreements-about the presence or absence of irony, the value of unity, whether we are in a forest or in the city-may tell us a good deal about our conceptions of lyric and demands on lyric. To encourage the project of treating our interpretations as data to be explained, I should like to note a couple of objections to this satisfying convergence-objections which might</page><page sequence="13">Culler * Data or Goals? 287 encourage us to see it as the product of conventional and generic demands. The first bears on the notion that this poem is a Baudelairian art poetique. As Sandro Genovali observes in Baudelaire, 0 della dissonanza, there are actually very few synesthesias in Baudelaire-"des parfums verts" is not a familiar kind of image in Baudelaire but, on the con- trary, very rare (1971: 137-147). There are poems that talk about synesthesia--"j'aime a la fureur/ Les choses oiu le son se mele a la lumiere" (Les Bijoux)-but it is not a major poetic technique. So an initial problem is that if "Correspondances" is about poetry, it is not describing what this poetry does. Still, one might answer this valid objection by conceding that Baude- laire is not interested in synesthesia, as the first tercet suggests, so much as in sensations as stimuli to reverie, memory, imagination: the other smells corrompus, riches, et triomphants Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies, ... Qui chantent les transports de lesprit et des sens. This exfoliation is both the subject of poetry and the process of poetic production, and in taking "Correspondances" as an art poetique one can bracket the first two lines of the tercets while concentrating on the last four. This defense, however, only increases the pertinence of the second objection, which bears on the interpretation of the tercets as glorifying tropological relations-specifically on such claims as Leo Bersani's that comparisons using the word comme demonstrate the relations we are invited to perceive in nature. Paul de Man notes of the final comme in the poem ("Et d'autres, comme l'ombre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens"), "Ce comme n'est pas un 'comme' comme les autres." It is not compara- tive, bringing together different sorts of sensations, bridging gaps in a metaphorical transfer of properties or fusion involving analogy ("des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants"). It is a comme of enumera- tion-smells such as a, b, c-opening a list which can go on without getting us anywhere else. De Man writes, Considered from the perspective of the "thesis" or of the symbolist ideology of the text, such a use of "comme" is aberrant. For although the burden of totalizing expansion seems to be attributed to these particular scents rather than the others, the logic of "comme" restricts the semantic field of "par- fums" and confines it to a tautology: "II est des parfums ... / Comme (des parfums)." Instead of analogy, we have enumeration, and an enumeration which never moves beyond the confines of a set of particulars: . . . the enumeration could be continued at will without ceasing to be a repetition, without ceasing to be an obsession rather than a metamorphosis, let alone</page><page sequence="14">288 Poetics Today 9:2 a rebirth. One wonders if the evil connotations of these corrupt scents do not stem from the syntax rather than from the Turkish bath or black mass atmosphere one would otherwise have to conjure up. For what could be more perverse or corruptive for a metaphor aspiring to transcendental to- tality than remaining stuck in an enumeration that never goes anywhere? . . . Enumerative repetition disrupts the chain of tropological substitution at the crucial moment when the poem promises, by way of these very sub- stitutions, to reconcile the pleasures of the mind with those of the senses and to unite aesthetics with epistemology. That the very word on which these substitutions depend would just then lose its syntactical and semantic univocity is too striking a coincidence not to be, like pure chance, beyond the control of author and reader. (1984: 249-250) This shift to a comme of enumeration does rather disrupt the synthe- sis that takes the tercets as a celebration of the tropological produc- tivity of poetic imagination and memory (poetry as the exploitation of a clavier de correspondances). The question, then, is what does one do with this significant textual detail, whose very flatness and negativity make it extremely seductive. The hermeneutic imperative, which seeks to transmute negatives into positives, tempts us to make this the basis for a new interpretation of the poem. There would be a strong temptation, then, to make a further interpretive move and take the poem to be about the disruption of tropological substitution and its totalizing goals by the sheer materiality of language and thus ultimately to read "Correspondances" as a poem that demystifies lyric. Such moves are tempting because of our assumption that to produce a new interpretation of a major literary work is the goal of the critical endeavor but I wish to resist it and to ask whether resistance makes any difference. Would it make any difference, that is, to think that instead of working at a new reading of the poem one were in fact at- tempting to move toward an elucidation of the interpretive processes associated with lyric? De Man remarks, suggestively, that "The lyric is not a genre but one name among several to designate a defensive motion of understanding, the possibility of a future hermeneutics" (Ibid.: 261). The lyric seems to consist of patterns of anthropomor- phism and naturalization that guarantee the intelligibility of tropes. Here, in readings of a poem that has long been taken as exemplary not of the lyric but of a poetics of the lyric, we have observed among other things the use of the notion of intertextuality as a fundamentally recuperative strategy, ultimately a strategy for making sense of sheer repetition. My two approaches to Baudelairian intertextuality in effect recuperated intertextual echoes as a potential attitude of conscious- ness-what at the thematic or psychological level we call "irony." Study of the interpretive moves illustrated in both the tradition and our re- sponse to that tradition would show how genres, such as lyric, are sets</page><page sequence="15">Culler * Data or Goals? 289 of reading strategies for making sense of language, ways of convinc- ing ourselves not only that language is meaningful, that it will give rise to an intuition or understanding, as would be amply illustrated by our interpretive examples, but also that this is an understanding of the world. To take interpretations as data rather than goals does not mean an end to interpretation but rather a displacement of our present goal: the production of new interpretations of literary texts as the aim and the test of literary study. Encouraging an understanding of language and genre, which now often have to be achieved by interpreting works as allegories of reading rather than by interpreting readings them- selves, this would give us a more capacious, differently articulated domain of knowledge and might also discourage the impression so many of our colleagues in other fields seem to have gained, that what we in literary studies think of as knowledge is in fact just an endless series of ingenious interpretations.
