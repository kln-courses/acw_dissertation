Toynbee, Director of Studies in the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Research Professor of International History in the University of London. Volumes VII-X. [Issued under the Auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs.] (New York: Oxford University Press. I954. PP. xxx, 772; ix, 732; vii, 759; vi, 422. $35.oo.) MR. Toynbee is at once a historian of profound insight and a most painstak- ing empiricist. But he is also a mystic, prophesying. His new volumes contain additions to the edifice of doctrine set up in the first six; they contain, more pro- fusely than the first six volumes, minor essays in the comparative interpretation of history which are not necessarily related to the main doctrine; and they con- tain a host of secondary researches designed to enlighten the darker corners of history where conventional historians rarely have the courage to intrude. Some critical readers will probably think the minor adventures-for they are mostly adventures-the most valuable material in the volumes. There are, for example, comparative studies of imperial communications (VII, 8o-io8), legal systems (VII, 255-93), armies (VII, 3I8-44), and civil services (VII, 344-72) which throw much light on the character and quality of the main institutions which any large, composite state must have. The more special study of imperial frontiers and of barbarians living beyond the frontiers and eventually breaking through them (VIII, i-8i) takes Chadwick's work of forty years ago and cor- relates it with the work of Lattimore on the frontiers of China and with a survey of the careers of the primitive Muslim Arabs and of other transfrontier barbarians. Another very valuable passage is that about renaissances (IX, i-i66). Compari- sons of unquestionably analogous phenomena of this kind are long overdue, and Toynbee's suggestion that some societies proved able to ingest and dominate their rediscoveries, while others were stultified by them, is at least worthy of serious consideration. There are many other instructive comparative passages. The essential Toyn- bee, however, is the Toynbee of the rise and fall of civilizations, of "universal states," "universal churches," and the like. In approaching the additions in the new volumes to this doctrine we must take note that Toynbee sees in history "a vision . . . of God revealing Himself in action to souls that were sincerely seeking Him" (X, 2). In face of this, it is the business of the reviewer who does not find God in history to judge by results. One result was that Toynbee undertook his gigantic work. The work is, in fact, a theodicy, and we might never have had it if Toynbee had not been powerfully moved by religious yearning. The 849</page><page sequence="2">8So Reviews of Books new volumes reveal this fully and with the utmost frankness, which the old ones did not. In view of Mr. Toynbee's opinions, therefore, we need not be greatly sur- prised to meet in Volume VII the suggestion that universal churches, such as the medieval Roman Church, are a higher species of human society than civiliza- tions and are possibly destined to replace civilizations as the frame of human society in the future (pp. 420-49). The new volumes complete Toynbee's main scheme of history, placing all the "higher religions," which are embodied in universal churches, in between the "secondary" and "tertiary" civilizations. The tertiary civilizations are those existing today, our own "Western," the "Orthodox Christian in Russia," the "Hindu," etc., and the secondary are the "Babylonic," "Indic," "Hellenic," etc. The higher religions were created by the "internal pro- letariat" of some of the secondary civilizations, the internal proletariat being the masses, including peoples of alien civilization brought under political subjection to the society by conquest. The churches served as means for "apparentation and affiliation" as between secondary and tertiary civilizations. The "primary" civiliza- tions, "Egyptiac," "Sumeric," "Minoan," and two in the New World, are now conmpleted for India and China by the "Indus Culture" and the "Shang Culture" -which, T believe, is sound, but will surely gravel the Sinologists. The pri- mary civilizations were related (not apparented) to the secondary civilizations through religions, but not higher religions. These earlier cases of relationship occurred through religions of the "dominant minority" or of the "external pro- letariat." The dominant minority means the ruling clique of a civilized society in the society's later centuries when it creates little which is new; the religion in question is, in fact, the old religion of the society. The external proletariat is the barbarian invaders who overrun declining civilized societies and bring with them their own religion of anthropomorphic deities, such as the Greek Olym- piad. In the new volumes the functions of these two kinds of religion are made completely clear (VII, 392-409, Table IV ad fin. and passim). This interpretation of history is made in the light of Bergson's theory of "dynamic religion," a theory which is effectively sustained for primitive societies by the work of such anthropologists as Wilson Wallis, and Philleo Nash. I be- lieve that the theory is equally applicable to civilized societies, but that a number of the distinctions and characterizations Toynbee makes in so applying it are either oversimplified or misconceived in the interests of his own religious preoccupation. Anybody who thinks, however, that Toynbee can for this reason be dismissed as a serious historian makes a superficial judgment. Toynbee's main thesis is, for all its rather gross inaccuracies, a matter of vast importance. In fact, it is, in my opinion, an approach to the dominating process in the history of civilized societies as those societies have developed since their first appearance in the fourth or fifth millennium B.C. Spengler's theory was an approach also, but a more distanit one, narred by far greater error than Toynbee's. There is, currently, one other versioin of the process, Sorokin's, but this is ex-</page><page sequence="3">Tovnbee: A Study of History 85I pressed in a forbidding conceptual apparatus, and most historians have never heard of it. Since Toynbee's theory is so important, then, it is worth attempting here a brief (and thus inevitably dogmatic) summary of its distortions, now that the theory is completely developed. There is no warrant for calling some civilized religions higher and thereby distinguishing them from others. Nor is any religion created by the internal proletariat. Here Toynbee has had some sort of aberration, but, as usual when he goes wrong, he nevertheless discerns something of great importance: the masses, the internal proletariat, do not create religion, but every new or recon- stituted religion is created for them; it is indeed invariably brought down to their level and is not effective until it is so vulgarized. It is a reasonable guess that the re-animation of the masses with hope is the essential means whereby religion brings about the revival of a disintegrating society. There is truth in Toynbee's opinion that conquering barbarians contribute a different kind of religion from that previously established in a civilized society; it is also true that large elements in a new religious conglomeration are sometimes taken from alien civilized sources. But always the total conglomeration is a mixture, in vary- ing proportions in different cases, from all three sources. If the later religions on the whole show less than the earlier of the barbarian element and more borrow- ing from other societies, that is nothing like sufficient ground for distinguishing them as higher and as producing churches; there were formidable churches in Egypt and Mesopotamia. As to who creates religions, it is always small groups of great leaders, and, if they are not already priests, as in Toynbee's cases of crea- tion by the dominant minority, they are likely soon to become so though there are variations in the extent to which ecclesiastical leadership becomes differ- entiated from secular. How, incidentally, can Toynbee possibly contend that Hinduism-according to his own doctrine-was created by any but the dominant minority? It is of lesser importance that Toynbee has several strange ideas about par- ticular morphological developments, about both Russia and Japan for instance, and an astounding idea about the Arab caliphate being a continuation after iooo years interval of the Achaemenian Empire. There is an infuriating passage (IX, 682-92) in which Toynbee sees his own earlier error in discerning the morphologi- cal development of Egypt, but then returns to his error on the ground that the "Old Kingdom" cannot have been a universal state because its dominant min- ority created a new architecture (the pyramids) and dominant minorities are not creative. It is, no doubt, true that usually there is little new creation in times of universal states, but a hard and fast dogma that there can be none is utterly unhistorical. There are, unfortunately, many other false quantities besides these. But the new volumes contain many things of value not yet mentioned. There is an excellently well-balanced discussion of the prospects of Western civiliza- tion (IX, 406-644). The discussion of freedom and determinism in history (IX, I67-405) is abreast of the best contemporary opinion on the subject. The largely</page><page sequence="4">852 Reviews of Books autobiographical matter in Volume X has its use in helping the assiduous reader to understand the author. Mr. Toynbee was never a stylist, and in these four volumes his style is notably worse than it was in the first six. It is hideously overburdened with Bibli- cal and classical allusions, and the syntax is constantly tortured beyond all reason to force it to carry the burden. This is a serious obstacle for any reader: reading these volumes is a task. In spite of the frightful style, the strange distortions in the theodicean interest, and a general propensity to exaggerate some differences, this remains a great work.
