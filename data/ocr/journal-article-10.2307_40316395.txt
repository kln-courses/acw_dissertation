In 1909, an expedition to the Polar Urals led by D. T. Yanovich investigated some 358 above-ground and shallow pit burials at cemetery sites in the Obdorsk (now Salekhard) region - an important center of trade. Most of the artifacts come from the Khalas-Pugor ("Island of the Dead") cemetery on the Little Ob River. The resulting ma- terial culture collection, housed at the Museum of Anthropology of Moscow State Uni- versity, languished for decades. Its accompanying pictorial documentation and field notes were lost. Only in 1994, with the discovery of a field diary kept by Yanovich's de- scendants, was it known that the materials came from more than one site. This article summarizes recent studies of the collection. Descriptive analysis of the artifacts, to- gether with certain archival references, indicates that most of the graves date to the early to middle nineteenth century. Ethnic affiliation of the graves could not be deter- mined based on the limited surviving skeletal material, but statistical analysis of the grave goods demonstrates some separation into groups that coincide with "Khanty" and "Nenets" burial practices, as known ethnographically. On a larger scale, the grave goods, which are mostly imported, illustrate a wide-spread trade network linking Euro- pean Russia with the "ethnographic hinterland," and at the same time fostering a high degree of interaction between the various ethnic and linguistic groups who were at- tracted to the annual Obdorsk Fair. Introduction "The Ostyak" collection (N 281) from the Museum of Anthropology at Moscow State University, col- lected by D. T. Yanovich in 1909, is probably the most extensive collection of skeletal remains and material culture of the indigenous people of the Lower Ob region in the nineteenth and early twen- tieth centuries. The collection numbers 5159 items. Most of the materials are from excavations conducted at the large Khalas-Pugor cemetery. Ad- ditionally, there are items from a number of ceme- teries along the Bolshaya and Malaya Ob Rivers and the Longot- Yugan River (Fig. 1).

The ar- chaeological expedition of 1909 was headed by Yanovich, who had been a participant of the Rus- sian Royal Academy of Sciences expedition to the Polar Urals that was sponsored by the Kuznetsov brothers (an industrialist family) under the leader- ship of O. O. Baklund (Baklund 1911). The materials collected by Yanovich present an opportunity to compare a typical archaeological collection with textual data from the same time period. Almost all decades of the nineteenth cen- tury have been marked by expeditions to the Lower Ob regions. Some of the individuals buried at the cemeteries excavated in 1909 were indeed among those observed and described in the 1844 ethnographic studies by Alexander Castren (Cas- tren 1853), and also by Finsch and Brem in 1876 (Finsch 1879), by Stephan Sommier in 1880 (Som- mier 1885), etc. The Lower Ob region holds much current in- terest for the history of material culture. This terri- tory was traditionally attractive to travelers. The region around Obdorsk (now the city of Salekhard) used to be a remote border zone that attracted southern and western cultures. These cultures left behind abundant archaeological records character- ized by an extensive scale of movement of material objects. The Scandinavian-made, oval-shaped fibula of the tenth century stored at Salekhard Mu- seum and English-made tin plates of the nine- teenth century discovered by Finsch in the Yondyr nomad tents clearly attest to this fact. In relatively recent historic times, the Khanty people and then the Komi advanced into the lower reaches of the Ob River area. The painstaking ef- fort of numerous travelers to reach Obdorsk in the nineteenth century illustrates this paradoxical at- traction to the "edge of civilization." From the descriptions of nineteenth century Tavelers and scientists, we know that the most sig- lificant event at the time - the climax, so to speak, dì the annual cycle- was the Obdorsk Fair. The Yanovich archaeological collection is a microcosm )r a reflection of that fair. To be precise, this col- ection offers only half of the image. Looking into his reflection, we can imagine ourselves in the ¡leds of the Ostyak (Khanty) or Samoyed (Nenets) eturning home from Obdorsk in the later days of anuary. It is important to emphasize that the study of :ultural heritage of the nineteenth century is valu- ible not only as a retrospective view of the past, but lIso for understanding modern material culture pro- :esses. Many of the craft items of the late nine- eenth century continue to be used today and re- nain as objects of study. (Metal ornaments for belts, oickles, knives and their sheaths, and decorations dt women's hats are examples of craft continuity.) Archaeological and ethnographic studies of the more recent burials in the Lower Ob area can be considered as an interesting cultural phe- nomenon, per se. "Ethnographic exotica" and the juxtaposition of the two cultures - "the European civilization" and the traditional way of life of the indigenous people - had been explicitly perceived in Obdorsk of the nineteenth century. Local cemeteries with surface burials surrounded by abandoned sleds, and with remains of ceremonial sacrificial feasts and complete sets of burial utensils, played a sig- nificant part in the "ethnographic exotica" percep- tion of the region. As early as 1946, Chernetsov studied such cemeteries in the immediate vicinity of the city of Salekhard (Talitskaya 1953: 246). From the beginning of the seventeenth cen- tury, when Russian settlers penetrated the Lower Ob area, mass cemetery robberies came into play (the local populations had also been involved), which resulted in the Czar's Decree of 1610 that prohibited desecration of Ostyak graves (Russian Historical Library 1875:216). Nineteenth century scientists were under- standably tempted to delve into the above-ground caskets (miniature ethnographical and anthropo- logical museums) that were in everyone's view - boxes with remains of the Ostyaks and the Samoy- eds buried in them. They found that many of the things discovered in the graves were imported; however, European scientists did not think of these objects as "their own," but saw them as eth- nographic objects that were worth collecting. The collection compiled by Yanovich was no excep- tion, as confirmed by numerous examples, since a considerable number of the objects were items that had recently crossed the Ural ridge. Transportation of the same objects back and forth across the Urals- first as trade items and later as scientific specimens - attests to a more complex interaction between the "central" and the "provincial" culture than at first apparent. It is reasonable to suggest that one cannot completely comprehend the culture of the "center" without the study of what seems at first to be a strictly "ethnographic province." Understanding this in- terrelationship contributes to the significance of the collection under consideration. The 1909 studies reported in Yanovich's1 diary in- dicate that at least 11 sites were investigated. A total of 358 burials were studied. The excavations in the vicinity of Khalas- Pugor (in Khanty it means the "island of the dead") in the Malaya Ob region were conducted on the most substantial scale. Eleven nomad tents and 154 burials (nos. 20-173) were excavated</page><page sequence="4">40 Arctic Anthropology 33:1 there. The burials were first described by a partici- pant of the Bremen Expedition to West Siberia, O. Finsch, who excavated four of them (Finsch 1879:499, 546). Craniological studies were con- ducted by Rudolf Virkhovoy. The total number of burials was about 50, as estimated by Finsch. This number included both well-pronounced surface burials in wooden caskets and below-ground buri- als in shallow pits with walls or coverts made of wooden planks. After having dated the trees grow- ing on the graves, it was determined that the buri- als were about 40 years old. S. Sommier once visited Khalas-Pugor, but never conducted any excavations at the request of the Russian Obdor citizen P. N. Roslyakov, who leased the place for fishing and was afraid to be held responsible for the desecration of graves. There is no general description of the ceme- tery in Yanovich's diary. It was located several hundred meters from the chooms [nomad tents] and was, judging by the evidence, an active ceme- tery. By virtue of circumstances, the fieldwork (more precisely, disassembling of the graves) did not encompass recent burials. In most cases, old half-rotten kholmers (grave constructions) were in- vestigated, but the memory of some of the buried people was still alive. (For example, Yanovich be- came aware of the fact that burial no. 1732 belonged to the Ostyak woman called Neodyu who could perform shaman ceremonies and who was married to a Samoyed of the Yadope family.) This attests to the fact that some, at least, of the burials were rela- tively recent. To collect additional evidence on the site, in- vestigations were initiated in 1991 and 1992, when it was discovered that remains of the "old ceme- tery" still exist in the vicinity of the modern settle- ment of Khalas-Pugor, the location of which has shifted somewhat to the south of the original set- tlement (Fig. 2). According to local people - the Komi, the Nenets and the Khanty - (A. M. Rochev, G. D. Filippov, D. S. Syaddai, V. G. Krouptinsky), the old cemetery has not been used since the 1940s because an administrative decree prohibit- ing surface burials had been imposed. The topography of the Khalas-Pugor area fea- tures the left bank of the Malaya Ob River that is elevated 4 to 5 m above the river level and extends about 500 m from north to south and 200 m from east to west. During floods, the elevated part of the bank becomes an island. Studies of exposures along the steep riverbank show that on the north end of the "island," where a settlement dating to the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth cen- turies was located, there was also a medieval set- tlement. Ceramic fragments collected on the bank suggest that the approximate age of this settlement goes back to the end of the 1st millenium-begin- ning of the 2nd millenium B.P. (Fig. 3). The old cemetery site is located on a small el- evation (up to 1.5 m), thickly covered with dwarf birch, wild rosemary, and bilberry; there are sev- eral birch trees that have grown to 4 m high. Remains of surface and other types of burial constructions are located in a 2000 m2 area. The total number of observable burials does not exceed 40-60, but there are reasons to believe that there are more. On the cemetery site, among the shrubs, several well-preserved rectangular grave houses with dimensions of about 2 m long and 0.8 m wide were found. The height of the structures is approx- imately 0.5 to 0.8 m, depending on the degree of preservation. They are made of wooden planks and constructed with nails with round cross-sec- tions. In all probability, they were made in the first decades of the twentieth century. The wooden covers of these grave houses have fallen through, exposing boat-shaped coffins inside. The bows and sterns are severed and fixed with planks (Figs. 4, 5). In most cases, remains of the deceased were not found in the coffins, but occasionally there were weathered white skulls and burial utensils (bronze chains, bells, and china dishes). The bod- ies were oriented with their heads toward the southeast. Bronze and iron pots were placed at their feet inside the caskets. Some of the dead seemed to be buried in pits. Such graves resem- bled small oval mounds surrounded by remains of wooden constructions. "Ugly and way too explicit" (Baklund 1911:112) traces of the 1909 excavations are now completely lost in time; modern inhabi- tants of the settlement remember them rather vaguely. Burial utensils, along with scientific observa- tions, have allowed scientists to date the graves. For example, in burial no. 89, there was found a five-kopeck coin of 1766 together with two-kopeck copper coins of 1800 and 1801, which were struck at the Ekaterinburg mint. In burial no. 88, a coin pendant made in the form of provincial coins with a blessing inscrip- tion in Arabic was found. According to the script, it dated to the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries (de- termined by Ye. A. Davidovich and confirmed by Professor G. A. Fyodorov-Davydov). Similar coins were observed in northwest Siberia around the turn of the twentieth century. They were observed, for example, on the Khanty ornaments acquired by Sirelius in the vicinity of the Vasyugan River in 1898 (Sirelius 1983:258). Bronze shaft-bow bells cast by Vasiliy Mak- ushin in the city of Slobodskoy of the Vyatka dis- trict in 1817 were found in burial no. 133 (similar to those in Fig. 6.4). It should be noted that similar bells were found among other ethnographic collec- tions made by Yanovich. In 1966, Gracheva found a bell made in 1806 in a modern Nenets burial on the Yamal Peninsula (Gracheva 1971:253).</page><page sequence="5">Murashko &amp; Krenke: Burials of the Lower Ob 41 Figure 2.

In burials no. 139 and no. 150 were found to- kens made by Ernest Laurer, who worked in Nur- enberg from 1791 to 1797 (Fig. 7.6, 7), depicting King Louis XVI (Spasskiy 1951:137). It goes with- out saying that the tokens give us only terminus post quern. The tokens have perforations in them, since they were used as decorations. It is quite possible that they were used for a prolonged pe- riod of time and that the burials they were associ- ated with date back not to the eighteenth, but to the nineteenth century. Some burials contained flat round snuffboxes made of bronze with a round center stamp. In one case, the Empress Catherine II(?) is depicted and in another, a man with a beard (Fig. 7:9). The snuff- boxes exhibit skillful workmanship: they were made on a lathe with a cast image stamped on a gilded background. They seem to have been manu- factured in one of the central cities of Russia. The time of production is probably the end of the eigh- teenth and the beginning of the nineteenth cen- turies. Burial no. 203 of Tar-Vanui Khalait (Fig. 1, no. 7), also excavated by Yanovich, had a similar snuffbox, with an image of Ekaterina II, that was placed next to a china cup made in Gzhel in the second half of the nineteenth century. Burial no. 56 included a china cup (Fig. 6:3) with cobalt painting made at the G. A. Markov plant located in the Bronnitsky District in the vicinity of Moscow (founded in 1830). According to the features on the stamp, this cup could be dated between the 1860s and 1890s (determined by T. D. Koryakina). Besides china, glass utensils were also found in the burials. A wine glass found in burial no. 54 was dated between the 1830s and 1840s because of its stylistic features. In the burial at the Tchaya River in the Tomsk region, a similar glass cup was found along with coins of 1828-1836 (Ozheredov 1989). A tin doll in burial no. 74 was dressed in the fashion of the first half of the nineteenth century (Fig. 8:4).</page><page sequence="8">44 Arctic Anthropology 33:1 Figure 5.

Some wooden utensils still preserve traces of varnish and paint. According to Gubarev, wooden spoons were popular items at the Obdorsk Fair; the Ostyak and the Samoyeds gladly purchased them (Gubarev 1863:225). Frag- ments of a bronze candlestick found in burial no. 121 also belonged to the nineteenth century (Fig. 7:4). A large collection of buttons, including one that features a warrior in early nineteenth century dress, unquestionably belongs to that century (such buttons were found in several burials excavated in 1909; these are burial nos. 50, 203, 264, and 351. See Fig. 7:5). In burial no. 80, a knife was found with a bone handle and a stamp featuring ("PAVLA") on the blade. It was probably made in the shops of the Pavlovo village at the Oka River in the Nizhny Novgorod District, which was famous for its knife production in nineteenth century Russia. Snuffboxes (powder flasks?) constructed of cow's horn and inlaid with tin were found in burial nos. 28, 126, and 128 (Fig. 8:1). Zuyev noted in 1771 that the Ostyak living in the lower Ob area widely used horns filled with tobacco (Zuyev 1947:41). Kovalsky, who spent the winter of 1848 in Obdorsk, mentioned a horn with tobacco in it as a burial item the Ostyak people put in their graves (Kovalsky 1853:26). Rudenko, who traveled with Yanovich to the Lower Ob River area, noted that he had never observed similar snuffboxes as household items of the Ostyak people he studied. However, in several graves at the Obdorsk ceme- tery that he was able to date to the 1840s-1850s, he found similar snuffboxes (Rudenko 1914a:10). Ivanov, who studied one of the snuffboxes found at Khalas-Pugor (burial no. 128) without inlaid or- namentation, but with a carving, noted that its cir- cular ornamentation is characteristic for Russian ivory carving of the eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries. He suggested that these snuff- boxes had been acquired from the Russians and were examples of Russian workmanship (Ivanov 1963:65). Some types of items that were found in the collection from Khalas-Pugor also occur in ethno- graphic collections dating to the end of the nine- teenth and the beginning of the twentieth cen- turies. They include a copper comb (burial no. 24) with paired horse's heads, probably manufactured in Russia. Similar decorative patterns can be found in the festive clothing of the Khanty living in the Berezovsky District (Museum of Tobolsk, in- ventory N 1999/1624) and in the clothing of the Mordva-Moksha in the Central Volga River region (Kalashnikov and Pluzhnikova 1990:99). Another example is the massive, round openwork buckles made of iron or copper fashioned into women's belts and worn over the outer clothing which were found in burial nos. 121, 126, and others (similar to those in Fig. 9:3). These items were described by Zuyev (1947:28) and Belyavskiy (1833:57). Finsch wrote that the buckles were manufactured by the Zyryans (the Komi) and sold to the Samoyeds for high prices (Finsch 1879:535). In Pauly's album, such a buckle was featured on the belt of a "Mezen Samoyed woman" (Pauly 1862). We observed a similar buckle on the belt of an Ostyak woman from Obdorsk in the picture by Sommier (Fig. 10). Negative evidence can be used to support the burial dates. For example, among the many finger rings at Khalas-Pugor, none were of the types found in West Siberian burials of the seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth century (Molodin 1979). The absence of rings of these ear- lier types indicates that none of the burials at Kha- las-Pugor is older than the eighteenth century. Most of the excavated Khalas-Pugor burials, judging by associated funerary objects, date from the early to middle nineteenth century; the latest are from the end of that century. In support of this conclusion, we present one more piece of indirect evidence. A letter from the Director of the expedi- tion, O. O. Baklund, to Professor D. N. Anuchin, dated the 14th of October, 1910 (archives of the Anthropological Museum of Moscow State Univer- sity), states that the excavations by Yanovich re- sulted in conflict with the local population and a threat of litigation. This is very important because it could indicate that recent burials had been de- stroyed. After the work at Khalas-Pugor, the expedi- tion of 1909 moved into the Bolshaya Ob area, where excavations were undertaken at several large burial sites (nos. 4-10, Fig. 1). More than 40 burials (nos. 209-253) were excavated in the clan cemetery of the Yadopchu clan. Yanovich was able to obtain detailed information on this site because two representatives of the clan were members of his excavation crew. Here is an excerpt of his diary: On a small dry sandy hill that is thickly covered with birch trees, willows, ash trees, wild rose- mary, mosses, and lichens, lie remains of the khol- mers (burial constructions). Many of the kholmers, some still standing, are covered by trees growing from the middle of the burial site. None of the kholmers are completely intact or recently con- structed. The Yadopchu Clan does not bury its dead here any longer; the last burial took place about 48 years ago [i.e., about I860]. According to the genealogy of the Yadopchu Clan compiled by Yanovich, the excavated burials date from the end of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century. The burial goods and a major part of the utensils belonging to the</page><page sequence="12">48 Arctic Anthropology 33:1 Figure 8.

The Obdorsk Ostyak (by Sommier, 1885). nineteenth century, along with earlier artifacts, confirm this hypothesis. For example, in burial no. 245 there was a brass cup, perhaps used for vodka. The cup is decorated with chasing and engraving and its style suggests that it belongs to the second half of the eighteenth century. At the same burial site was an even earlier item, a silver earring with beads, decorated with filigree and dated approxi- mately between the eleventh and thirteenth cen- turies. Neither the cup nor the earring can be used to determine the age of the burial under considera- tion, in which ornaments characteristic of the nine- teenth century were also found (Figs. 11:6, 8, and 12:1). A copper plate with a hunting scene motif is of special interest for dating (Fig. 8:3). It was found</page><page sequence="15">Murashko &amp; Krenke: Burials of the Lower Ob 51 Figure 11.

On the edge of the plate there are perforations for hanging, which suggest its use for cultic purposes. About ten plates with similar patterns are known according to descrip- tions and finds in the Lower Ob area near Obdorsk. As Prytkova suggested, they were commonly man- ufactured at the same place (Prytkova 1949:46). Some plates are marked with the date of 1834. Similar plates were common for households before the twentieth century. The Museum of Tobolsk ac- quired one of these plates in 1903 (N 3890/1694). The last excavations undertaken by Yanovich in the Bolshaya Ob area were in the vicinity of Pai- Khatu (Kazym-Paikhatskiye yurtas), where at three sites there was a concentration of 200 kholmers. According to Yanovich's diary, the excavations took place at the "new cemetery," where about 20 burials were investigated, including some contain- ing two bodies (Fig. 13). It is not inconceivable that older burials were mixed in among more re-</page><page sequence="17">Murashko &amp; Krenke: Burials of the Lower Obs 53 Figure 13. Burial no. 270 of the 1909 excavations.

For example, there are no good reasons to conclude that burial no. 292 could not have be- longed to the second half of the eighteenth cen- tury. Only two items were found in it - a fragment of a wooden cup and a copper comb. The latter, in all probability, was exported from Russia. A simi- lar comb occurred in burials dating to the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries at the Martynovsky site in Chouvashiya (Kakhovsky and Kakhovsky 1992:129). The 1909 excavations of burial nos. 298-358 took place at the cemetery Yumbarada Khalmeer at the mouth of the Shchuchya River in the vicinity of Lake Yumbar-to (Fig. 1, no. 11). Yanovich de- scribed this place as follows: The cemetery is located on the northwest sandy slope elevated abruptly 4 arshins (284 cm) above the lake level. There are approximately 100 graves, which are oriented along the northwest ridge of a watershed. This is connected to the bank of an- other lake containing clean and tasty water, which lies at the west end of the cemetery. In the last decade the wife of the great landowner, Yumbar Samoyed Khonant, was buried there. There are also two small larches, lonely among the tundra vegetation . . . The kholmers constitute boxes with two slop- ing surfaces forming a roof; among them there was a communal grave, with impressive dimensions (Fig. 14). To the north of each grave there were many abandoned sleds. The excavated burials were fairly recent, mostly belonging to the second half of the nineteenth century. Good preservation of organic remains and burial utensils support this interpretation. Bells dating to 1817 were found in burials no. 308 and no. 351. In burial no. 340, was a cup man- ufactured at the M. V. Dunashov plant and dated at 1850 to 1870. In burial no. 316, a saucer manufac- tured by M. S. Kuznetsov and dating after 1892 was found. In the same burial, a body cross was found (Fig. 7:1). The harness ornamentation (Fig. 7:2) from burial nos. 320 and 350 is characteristic of the type widely spread throughout nineteenth century Russia. Another distinctive item is a man's belt with a buckle and a knife in the sheath. (Fig. 11:7). The</page><page sequence="18">54 Arctic Anthropology 33:1 Figure 14. Communal burial at the Yumbarada-Khalmeer cemetery, incorporating burial nos. 350-355. earliest evidence of such types of artifacts belongs to the 1870s (one from the Museum of Tobolsk is pictured by Finsch). Khondazhayevsky acquired a similar belt in 1879 from the Nenets, who pur- chased it from the Zyryan (Tomilov 1986:180, 285). A similar belt was acquired in 1878 by Nor- denskiold from the Nenets in the Khabarovo vil- lage, Yugor Peninsula (Nordenskiold 1882:80). Belts of this type are common among the modern Khanty and Nenets; they are also common among the modern-day Khalas-Pugor inhabitants. Reindeer harnesses with copper parts (Fig. 12:2, 3) were widespread in the nineteenth cen- tury. (Zuyev had not mentioned copper parts, though he described in detail the reindeer har- ness.) These items were manufactured in the shops owned by Stepanov of Tobolsk (Dunin- Gorkavich 1911:125) by the Zyryans. Finsch men- tioned a Zyryan craftsman who lived in Obdorsk (Finsch 1879:455). Copper decorative plates and pendants (Fig. 9:1, 2) that decorated women's hats and were used as amulets were one of the most common items re- covered in the burials of the Lower Ob area. They were found in 162 grave assemblages. The collec- tion contains 90 types and a total of 580 speci- mens (Murashko and Krenke 1985). The Russians started to export prototypes of such decorative plates as early as the seventeenth century (Oklad- nikov 1950). Numerous shops continued to cast</page><page sequence="19">Burial Customs Murashko &amp; Krenke: Burials of the Lower Ob 55 this old style of decorative plates during the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries in West Siberia (in particular, in Tobolsk, Berezovo, Obdorsk, etc.) and in the Arkhangelsk region. Among the specimens mentioned above, only one very old item was found in a grave (burial no. 337) at Yumbarada Khalmeer; it was an engraved wine glass with the stem cut off, made in Russia in the mid eighteenth century. The alteration perhaps suggests that the specimen was used for a long time before being placed as grave goods. One can gather information about the burial prac- tices from drawings and written field notes made by Yanovich during the 1909 excavations of these cemeteries. A total of 286 descriptions and draw- ings of the burials have survived.3 The largest of the sites excavated, Khalas- Pugor, is noted for its uniformity of burial cere- mony. Only two out of 154 burials took place in pits; the rest were surface burials. When describ- ing funeral constructions (grave houses), Yanovich used the terms "upper kholmer," "kholmer," and a kholmer supported by two or three posts. Inside the kholmer, there was a coffin that was made of half of a boat. Adults were buried in the half-boats with their feet oriented to the bow; children's buri- als, as a rule, took place in box caskets. Sometimes a half-boat coffin was covered with the other half of the boat, or with sled planks, or birch bark re- moved from the chooms (tents). All the burials, except for two, were oriented to the south, southwest, or southeast; i.e., with the feet oriented downstream. Similar orientation pre- vailed in all the cemeteries excavated in the Bol- shaya Ob area. In the burials excavated along the Longot-Yugan River, the dead were oriented to the north, northeast, and northwest with their feet to- wards the river. Certain features of surface burials studied at the Longot-Yugan River lead to the conclusion that some of them had no grave constructions or coffins; the dead were simply placed on a wooden floor and covered with logs. The Vodye-Nyal cemetery in the Bolshaya Ob area is different from all the others in its compara- tively large number of pit burials. At the same time, half-boats served as coffins. The graves were covered with larch trees. In the clan burial of the Yadopchu family on Kheya Island, the deceased, both children and adults, and especially women, were placed in cas- ket boxes, a characteristic feature for this type. Al- most half of the women interred at this cemetery were placed in casket boxes. This peculiarity bridges the gap between the cemetery on Kheya Is- land and the Yumbarada Khalmeer cemetery, which is the northernmost site excavated by Yanovich at the mouth of the Shchuchya River. Human remains at the Yumbarada site were placed in box kholmers without half-boat coffins. The dead were oriented with their heads toward the northwest. Some of the burials hint at Chris- tian customs. For example, the grave pits were rel- atively deep, up to 0.7 m, with the heads oriented toward the west. A unique feature of this site was that it could have been a family cemetery. A characteristic feature of all the burials is an extended, supine position of the body. There are only a few burials that do not fit this pattern. The most common practice for all sexes and age groups was the extended, supine position with arms posi- tioned along the body (Fig. 15:1, 2). There are some cases with different positions of the arms. One of the hands (Fig. 15:3) or both (Fig. 16:2; Fig. 17:3) are placed on the pelvic area. There is certainly ceremonial significance in the placement of the hands on the pelvic area (Fig. 15:4). This position is common for men and women. There were several cases observed where the hands were placed on the belly area. One could suggest that this was inspired by Christian ceremo- nial practices. Additional features of other, similar graves confirm this suggestion. For example, in burial no. 316 at the Yumbarada Khalmeer site, a body cross was found (one of only two found on the cemetery). There were several cases where the dead were placed with their faces down. The body posi- tion, including arrangement of the arms and legs, was also different. In some cases, the body was ex- tended with arms placed under the belly. In oth- ers, the legs and arms were slightly bent, and occa- sionally the hands were tied up (Fig. 14, the upper row). This seems to be the shaman burial style. In the description of burial no. 192 (the Vode- nyal cemetery), Yanovich wrote that the shamans were buried face down, with arms along the bod- ies and tied up with rope. River cobble stones were placed on the back and waist area. A grave of this type was known to be that of a shaman buried at the end of the 1880s and considered a saint by the oras-yakh (a clan name among the local popu- lation). It seems that not all shaman burials were per- formed with these rites. For example, in burial no. 130 at the Khalas-Pugor site, defined by Yanovich as a shaman burial (probably based on local tradi- tion), the body was extended, lying on its back, and only the waist line was tied up with a tight knot. In his comments on burial no. 166, Yanovich noted that men did not have knots tied at their waist lines, but that women and shamans did. Burial no. 173, mentioned before, at the Kha- las-Pugor site, belonged to the Ostyak shaman</page><page sequence="20">56 Arctic Anthropology 33:1 Figure 15. Burial plans, 1909 ex- cavations.

In this case, the body was placed in the grave pit in a half-boat coffin, extended and positioned on the back with arms stretched along the body. The most common tradition for dressing the deceased was to cover the face with a piece of cloth, using buttons for eyes. Burials in a shroud were rare; sometimes one could observe the re- mains of outer clothing, a leather belt or a fur hat. In some cases the head of the person was covered with a cauldron, perhaps for isolation purposes. The burial goods were placed both inside the coffin (whether a casket or a boat) and in the va- cant space between the coffin and the outer box or kholmer. More than half of the grave assemblages in the collection number less than 10 items.4 There are a few burials containing 50 or more items. The most abundant grave goods were in burial no. 133, which belonged to a teenager and contained 92 items. Almost all the male and female burials con- tained domestic utensils, mostly made of wood. The women's burials contained a wider variety of such utensils. The dishes were usually placed near the head and occasionally near the body. Domestic utensils also were often placed at the feet. In some burials, chests containing tea dishes were found (Fig. 15:1). Knives were common in the burials of both sexes. There were also axes, parts of reindeer har- nesses, and snuffboxes. Sometimes there were two or three knives in the same burial. They were usu- ally placed at the hips, but in some cases, they were attached to the belt on the left side. The axes were usually placed at the right hand. The men's burials were distinguished by a special set of grave goods: they contained tools for woodworking (drills and braces), hunting weaponry (a bow, arrows, and powder flasks), and khoreis (a pole to control a harnessed reindeer). In women's burials, a specific set of utensils could be found. It consisted of tools to process skins (scrapers and special boards on which to stretch the hides), sticks</page><page sequence="22">5&amp; Arctic Anthropology 33:1 Figure 17.

Children's burials contained toys. As a rule, in men's burials the "men's" objects were placed to the right. In wom- en's burials, items were placed either to the left or in the middle. Miniature wooden anthropomorphic figur- ines were a common element in the inventory of all burials studied, except for those at Yumbarada Kholmeer. These figurines (Fig. 18) were clothed and instead of faces, tin plaques were used. In his descriptions, Yanovich called them by their Ostyak name - "sidyryan" or "sonchat. " These small idols were manufactured in memory of the deceased as temporary dwelling places for his or her soul. They were placed by the head, near the dishes. Ethnographic Interpretations In an attempt to make an ethnographic interpreta- tion of the archaeological materials in this collec- tion, the history of archaeological and anthropo- logical materials excavated by Yanovich has been studied. Comparative and statistical analysis, as well as studies of the historical context of the buri- als themselves and of excavations have been made. The first attempt at making an ethnographic</page><page sequence="24">60 Arctic Anthropology 33:1 identification of the population which left burial sites in the lower Ob area was done by Finsch; the craniological studies were done by Virkhov. Finsch placed at Virkhov's disposal 17 skulls from the "pagan burials" to study. These had been obtained from the place where, 33 years later, Yanovich collected his materials, including four skulls from the Khalas-Pugor cemetery. In his in- terpretation of the results of the study by Virkhov, Finsch wrote: The skulls from the Lower Ob area (Khalispagor) allow us to suggest that there was "a great mix of tribes" since among 4 skulls found there was one with a narrow nose bridge, another with a medium bridge, the third one with a flat bridge, and the fourth one with an unusually wide bridge at the nose . . . From what follows, I am inclined to sug- gest that the skulls A and B from Khalispagor be- long to the Samoyed people; but I have reason to believe, that these are Ostyak skulls, whereas the skulls with the Finnish pattern (No 6, for exam- ple), are evidently of Samoyed origin (Finsch 1879:499). As the polemic text by Finsch indicates, he was unhappy with the results of Virkhov's study, since it contradicted his own conclusions. But it is not clear from his text what convinced Finsch that his own ethnographic interpretations were correct and what evidence they had been based on. Proba- bly, Finsch had some conclusive information on the population of Khalas-Pugor which allowed him to be firm in his opinion. It is highly doubtful that Finsch's definition was based on the burial customs, since he had stated that in the "area dis- cussed both people live together and their burial ceremonies are quite similar" (Finsch 1879:499). In connection with this, it is of interest to re- call a remark made by Sommier. At Khalas-Pugor he met a Russian, called P. N. Roslyakov, who clearly remembered the visit of Finsch and Bremm to Khalas-Pugor. Roslyakov assured Sommier "that almost all the graves belonged to the Ostyak" (Sommier 1885:431). It is quite possible that the opinions of Roslyakov, which were recalled by Sommier, also convinced Finsch, who remarked that he was indebted to Roslyakov for obtaining valuable information. In 1941, Levin published the results of his study on the skulls from Khalas-Pugor. This publi- cation was a brief summary of craniological stud- ies from a series of skulls from northwest Siberia. Regarding the skulls with which we were con- cerned, it was only mentioned that they had come from the Khalas-Pugor cemetery, "which, accord- ing to the existing data, could belong to the Ostyak, with only a small part of the population being Nenets" (Levin 1941:27). In the Scientific Archive at the Museum of Anthropology at Moscow State University, a letter written by B. F. Adler in 1936 in answer to a re- quest by M. G. Levin was found. In his letter, Ad- ler wrote that Khalas-Pugor "is a big, old cemetery belonging to the Ostyaks and a small number of the Samoyeds." These "data" seem to have been used by Levin in his brief report. Adler, during his sojourn in Salekhard, could not freely leave the town, so his data could have only been obtained by interviewing the local population. Debets used Levin's results when he com- piled his classification of the Mongoloid types. In presenting his craniological materials, Debets used ethnic principles and modern ethnic terminology. The section on the Khanty was represented by a craniological series from Khalas-Pugor, and the section on the Nenets, along with other less nu- merous series, also included six skulls from Kha- las-Pugor. Yanovich assigned these burials to the "Samoyed" (Debets 1951:257-258). In 1942, Ales Hrdlicka used materials from Khalas-Pugor in his comparative analysis terming them the "Ostyak" collection (Hrdlicka 1942). In 1973, Dremov studied the results of mea- surements published by Debets, and came to the conclusion that, according to some features, the skulls from Khalas-Pugor resemble "the Nenets skulls, which apparently reflects the reality that the Nenets and the Khanty intermingled racially in the lower reaches of the Ob River." Dremov con- cluded, that "the Khanty of Khalas-Pugor and Surgut constitute a group that resulted from the commingling of the Ob Ugrians with local ethnic groups" (Dremov 1973:101-102). In two works on the culture published in 1950 and 1964, the archaeologists used the materi- als from this collection, interpreting them as being "Ostyak" or "Khanty" (Okladnikov 1950; Mogil- nikov 1964). It is stated in the scientific documentation of the collection that ethnologic attributes of the col- lection belong to the Khanty and the Nenets. In the 1909 "Report by D. T. Yanovich" it is stated: During the current year, the Kuznetsovs, Mr. N. and Mr. G., were the organizers of the expeditions to the Northern Urals in 1909. They donated an ethnographic collection to the Anthropological Museum, compiled by D. T. Yanovich. The collec- tion of artifacts was gathered in the locality be- tween the city of Obdorsk and the Shchuchya River, which was inhabited by the OSTYAKS and the OSTYAK SAMOYEDS. It is essential to note that 1930 museum de- scriptions of burials no. 20 through no. 360 con- sidered them to be from the same site, Khalas- Pugor. Only in 1994, after coming across a diary by Yanovich, was it clear that beginning with burial no. 174, other sites were involved. Before this in- formation became available, the authors made an</page><page sequence="25">Murashko &amp; Krenke: Burials of the Lower Ob 61 attempt to evaluate many of the ethnologic identi- fications in the collection using comparative and statistical methods. First, we attempted to conduct a comprehen- sive statistical analysis; i.e., to identify certain uni- form features by linkages between the attributes and to determine whether the similarities were correlated. In the process, some traits inevitably dropped out of the study due to low frequencies of occurrence, and the "complexes" revealed eluded ethnic interpretation. The study of production and dissemination of certain types of artifacts found in the collection has shown that for the Siberian people of the eighteenth through the beginning of the twentieth centuries, the objects of trade were not only metal ornaments, but also knives, axes, drills, scrapers, replicas of metal reindeer harnesses, snuffboxes of wood, horn, glass, or metal, beads, etc. Ethnographic literature and descriptions of material culture collections in museums provide this inventory. Out of an abundance of items found in the Yanovich collection, only anthropomorphic effi- gies and women's round belt buckles could be considered (hypothetically) as "ethnic markers." The anthropomorphic effigies were considered to be of "Khanty" origin and the round buckles of "Nenets" origin. Studies have established that only the Ostyak people practiced the rite of inter- ring effigies of the deceased in the graves (Castren 1860; Roslyakov 1895; Startsev 1928). Anthropo- morphic effigies were found in 78 burials. Ring-shaped women's belt buckles (similar to those in Fig. 9:3) of the eighteenth century were observed by Zuyev only among Nenets women (Zuyev 1947:28). Yanovich wrote that these buck- les were "Samoyed" in origin. However, other re- searchers of the nineteenth and twentieth centur- ies observed similar buckles among the Khanty and Zyryan women. There were 44 cases of similar buckles in the collection, most of them from the Yumbarada-Khalmeer site. Chi-square analysis to determine associations between the anthropomorphic effigies and the ring- shaped buckles showed a negative correlation in women's graves [i.e., separating the "Khanty" and the "Nenets" groups]. An additional point to emphasize is that some ceremonial customs seem to have definite ethnological associations. Chernetsov wrote about a custom among the Khanty people to place plaques on the chests of the deceased for religious pur- poses (Chernetsov 1959). There is no evidence in ethnographic literature that this custom existed among the Nenets people. According to the ethnographic studies, the custom of using a boat as a coffin is more common among the Khanty than among the Nenets (Zuyev 1947; Gondatti 1888; Bartenev 1895; Roslyakov 1895; Khomich 1966; Sokolova 1971; Gracheva 1971). The chi-square test established a positive sta- tistical correlation between the presence of anthro- pomorphic effigies in women's burials and place- ment of a plaque on the chest in men's burials [i.e., an alignment of two "Khanty" traits]. A trend also exists to combine the "Khanty" ethnic mark- ers with boat burials, and the "Nenets" markers with the use of box "caskets." Hence, three groups of burials were identi- fied: those with "Khanty" features, those of the "Nenets" tradition, and those with neither of these features. It was later discovered, when the diaries by Yanovich surfaced, that the statistical division of burials into two traditions - the Khanty and the Nenets - coincided precisely with the division of the materials by site. One group included all the burial sites located in the Bolshaya Ob area and Khalas-Pugor; another coincided with the Yum- barada-Khalmeer site at the mouth of the Shchu- chya River. However, the problem of ethnic identi- fications for the entire material culture collection is not solved. The written evidence of the eighteenth cen- tury indicates not only coexistence of the Ostyaks and Samoyeds in the lower reaches of the Ob River, but also the existence of populations of mixed origin. Zuyev, who visited Obdorsk in 1771, wrote: The Samoyed people living at the mouth of the Ob' River are the essence of the two peoples, since they have ways and customs of both the Ostyaks and the Samoyeds; with the Samoyeds they be- have in the Samoyed ways, with the Ostyaks - in the Ostyak ways. However, the mixture of the two peoples is evident in every way except for lan- guage. The Samoyed men marry Ostyak women and Ostyak men marry Samoyed women and have little difficulty in doing so (Zuyev 1947:21-22). Census results of the eighteenth century sup- port numerous intermarriages between the Ob- dorsk Ostyaks and Samoyeds (Babakov 1976; Vasi- lyev 1979; Sokolova 1983). According to Vasilyev, the results of census IV (1782) showed that 43% of the Ostyak males from the city of Obdorsk were married to "Samoyed women," and 38% of the Samoyeds of the Obdorsk region were married to "Ostyak women" (Vasilyev 1979:125-126). Ac- cording to census IV, 12% of the total number of marriages occurred between the Ostyak and the Samoyed people at Voitvazhsky yurtas (Khalas- Pugor) (Babakov 1976:103). According to the cen- sus of 1795, 40.5% of the marriages that had oc- curred in six "Ostyak towns," in the vicinity of the city of Obdorsk, were "with Samoyed women" (Sokolova 1983:123).</page><page sequence="26">Conclusion 62 Arctic Anthropology 33:1 Kushelevskiy, who studied land transporta- tion patterns between the Yenisei and the Ob Rivers in 1862, wrote in his "Travel Notes": I would like to separate the Ostyak and the Samoyed people, since the tribes differ distinctly in language and customs; however, the marital connections united their ways and customs so strongly, that at the present time they have very much in common. Independence of their original customs has not been totally lost; however, Rus- sian traders and entrepreneurs, the Zyryans and the Pustozers immensely influenced it. Conse- quently, when I describe the Samoyeds of the ter- ritory, I should abandon the attempt to describe them as a separate group, since without sufficient data I could not precisely determine the origin of their mingled ways and customs by their ethnic background (Kushelevskiy 1868:3). Alexander Castren, who visited Obdorsk in 1844, wrote: According to their ways of life, the Obdorsk Ostyaks could be divided into two categories: fish- ermen and hunters. The former live in the vicinity of the rivers, primarily along the Ob and Narym Rivers, the latter are nomads. At least for part of the year, they spend time in the tundra and are in constant contact with the Samoyed tribe. The number of the Ostyaks that are engaged in rein- deer breeding is relatively small and annually de- creasing due to the commingling with the large Samoyed tribe population. The Samoyed influ- ence was so strong that the Ostyak reindeer breed- ers not only adopted the religion, customs, and ways of life of their neighbors, but they also spoke the Samoyed language more freely than their own. That is why those who wanted to study the Ostyak ways of life should look to the Ostyak fishermen. But even the fishermen had different lifestyles: some of them only fished, others both fished and bred reindeer. The latter, at least in summer, had two households: some remained at the rivers, while others followed the reindeer on their migra- tions. . . Roaming with their reindeer along the coast of the Arctic Sea, the Ostyaks, much like the Russians and the Samoyeds, fished, hunted wal- rus, seal, polar bear, etc. . . The Samoyeds and the Ostyaks, whose only occupation was to breed rein- deer, used to go to the sea coast in early spring; those who left part of their families at the rivers were not in a hurry, since they would not be able to reach the remote sea coast anyway. They lived in permanent dwellings, called yurtas, in the forests, whereas some Samoyeds and nomad Ostyaks did not have this type of dwelling. By the end of December, all these roaming hordes used to show up at the Obdorsk Fair (Castren 1860:192- 193). This lengthy quotation not only accurately reflects the system of land-use of the indigenous people of the Obdorsk North, who had synthesized all traditional ways of using the natural resources in the region, but also illustrates the impossibility of ethnic differentiation among this population using administrative ethnographic stereotypes such as "the Ostyak - fisherman - yurta" or "the Samoyed - reindeer - choom." Among the Obdorsk Ostyaks, the investiga- tors of the nineteenth century mentioned a large number of linguistic borrowings from the Sa- moyed and Zyryan languages (Abramov 1857:332). Modern taxonomy of the Obdorsk Ostyak language has not been determined, and in the work of one of the authors it is mentioned both as "an Obdorsk dialect" and "an Obdorsk version of the western dialect of the Khanty language" (Tereshkin 1966). "The Nenets of the southern part of the Yamal Peninsula" have numerous lexical borrowings from the "Khanty language" (Tereshchenko 1966: 393). Khaidu mentioned lexical borrowings in the northern Khanty dialects from the Komi and Nenets languages and wide-spread bilingual and multilin- gual occurrences (Khaidu 1985:48). Judging from the local and dialectical subdi- visions of the Samodayan and Ob-Ugrian lan- guages, from local identification of the indigenous people (i.e., wide-spread self-identification accord- ing to the place of habitation), and from numerous descriptions of local subethnic and interethnic versions of material culture among people living in northwest Siberia, the linguistic, cultural, and economic synthesis of the "Obdorsk Ostyaks and Samoyeds" was the rule, rather than an exception. Ethnocultural and ethnolinguistic trends de- scribed by Zuyev in the last third of the eighteenth century and by the authors of the nineteenth cen- tury fit into the picture of ethnic continuity, which is characterized by vague linguistic and ethno- graphic boundaries and by the many commonali- ties observed. Theoretical analysis of similar phe- nomena was represented in the works of Alekseyev (1979) and Kryukov (1989). Hence, it is evident that the burial sites we have been discussing were located in a region where prolonged and close contacts between all three branches of the Ural languages (Khanty, Nenets, and Komi) are suggested to have taken place. This region has also been noted for the in- termingling of every kind of traditional arctic land-use, and for the direct influence of trade rela- tionships with Russia at the Obdorsk Fair that was held by the Obdorsk people for two months out of every year. Having embraced the task "to determine the ethnic affiliation" of the nineteenth century materials from burials excavated in the early twentieth cen- tury and reposited in the Museum of Anthropol-</page><page sequence="27">End Notes Murashko &amp; Krenke: Burials of the Lower Ob 63 ogy collections, we made a typical mistake. We failed to determine not only "the ethnic affilia- tion," but also whose "ethnic background" we wished to determine. That of the people whose burials were excavated by Yanovich in 1909, or that of the producers of the goods that were found in their graves? Nor could we differentiate ethno- cultural traditions in the techniques of manufac- ture of the objects that have come down to us. Results of the study of human skeletal re- mains show only some local physical types, which probably resulted from a long history of intermar- riages between Ob Ugrians, Samodayans, and probably other ethnic groups as well. The ethnocultural study of the collection showed that the grave goods consist of items whose origins resulted from cultural interaction of traditions taking place at different times and among different ethnic groups, and from trade re- lationships between local groups of indigenous people. These people were ancestors of the mod- ern Khanty and Nenets and also represented new- comers - the Zyryans, Russians, Tatars, and others. Therefore, the study of burial goods and skeletal remains that are in the Museum collection does not allow one to make definite conclusions on the "ethnic backgrounds" of the population that left behind these burials. A totally new turn in ethnographic evidence was presented in the field diaries of Yanovich. His descriptions of burial constructions and the infor- mation accompanying them show that some of the burials he excavated belonged to different "clans" or kinship -territorial groups. These clans evi- dently had some cultural characteristics that were reflected in the form of burial constructions. One-fifth of the burials described in the diary define the "ethnic background" of the deceased in terms that corresponded to the official ethno- nymics of the day; for example, "the Ostyak," "the Samoyed," "the Ostyak(ish) Samoyed/Samoyed(ish) Ostyak." In the comments about the burials at Kheya Island, there is an interesting explanation that sheds light on the meaning of the ethnic terms: . . . "the deceased of the Yadopchu Pok- hron-yakh clan who had Samoyed wives from the Yamal still speak to each other in Samoyed, [being] the Samoyed Ostyaks." According to the diaries, it is impossible to establish whether the defini- tions of the ethnic background of the burials were word-for-word translations of the information ob- tained from local aboriginals, or interpretations by Yanovich. In both cases, we could not establish definite correlation of the terminology of official ethnic identification in the aboriginal population of the Lower Ob area in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The terminology that was used by the indigenous population of the nineteenth century to express their ethnic identity was adequate to their own self-awareness. That is why we can con- sider the aggregate of archaeological materials that have come down to us preserved in this collection as a late colonial version of the "Obdorsk Aborigi- nal" culture. The culture of the Obdorsk aboriginals of the nineteenth century was, on the one hand, subdi- vided into numerous factions that preserved local clan peculiarities of certain groups of Samodayan and Ugrian people in the Lower Ob region within a single type of traditional economy and land-use. On the other hand, this culture experienced strong influences from the outside that later were in- cluded in the structure of close trade connections, especially in the nineteenth century. 1. The fate of the Ostyak collection of the Museum of Anthropology was a reflection of controversy in the history of twentieth century Russia. The study of museum materials and preparation for publica- tion was begun by Yanovich, with Professor D. N. Anuchin as scientific advisor, but had not been finished by 1914 and was interrupted for two decades. In the 1930s, Yanovich was subject to re- pression and died in exile. Vasilyev was also ex- iled in the 1930s. As of the mid 1930s, only a small part of the collection documentation was preserved, which resulted in numerous and seri- ous mistakes in the provenance documents. The primary mistake was to associate all the burials with the same site - Khalas-Pugor. Only in 1994 did the authors manage to find the descendants of Yanovich, who had preserved a part of his archives, including a field diary of the 1909 expedition that shed light on the unknown history of some of the collection artifacts. 2. For all the burials, Yanovich applied continuous numbering. 3. In addition to the Archives of Illustrations at the Museum of Anthropology and the archives of the descendants of Yanovich, there is a series of site plans made in 1912-1913, edited by Yanovich.
