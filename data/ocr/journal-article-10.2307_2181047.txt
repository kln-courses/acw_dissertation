<plain_text><page sequence="1">DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES La philosophic de la nature, I. Identit' du monde et de la connaissance. II. Le primat du phenomene dans la connaissance. Par GEORGES MATISSE. Paris, Felix Alcan, i938. Pp. iV, 256; iv, 280. These two volumes, which are designed, when put together, to form a systematic 'philosophy of nature', provide another example of the current trend toward phenomenalism and positivism. "In the beginning was sensa- tion. All knowledge has its source in it" (ii). Every problem whose solu- tion cannot be formulated in representations derived from what is given in sense is a false problem (iii). From this starting-point the author seeks in the first volume to work out his psychology, and in the second his philosophy of science. With the order and clarity that is so characteristic of the better French writing, he considers one by one those conscious states that might be conceived to offer difficulty for his sensationalism-memory, concepts, in- tuition, the a priori, mystic insight-and fits them all triumphantly into his scheme. In the second volume he turns to the ways in which "we tend spontaneously to class or organize the sensible representations whose collec- tion constitutes for us the inner and outer world". Conspicuous among these are space and time, to which he devotes much attention. That they are not a priori and necessary is proved, he thinks, by the discovery of non- Euclidean spaces; neverthless they are "instruments of thought" or "sys- tems of classification", by which the mind gives order to its sensations. In three well-informed chapters he applies his theory ingeniously to the con- cepts of matter and energy. On the whole, the second volume seems more impressive than the first. For the real difficulties with a sensationalism of this type lie in its metaphysical foundations; and M. Matisse, writing with little attention to the historical criticisms of the position, takes them too lightly in his stride. BRAND BLANSHARD SWARTHMORE COLLEGE Le problme de la substance. Par HPLMENE KNOCZEWSKA. Paris, J. Vrin, I937. PP. iv, 300. This book is written from the standpoint of objective idealism. The author follows the development of the idea of substance from its crude common- sense form to the refined form which it has found in modern physics. The refinement of the conception of substance runs parallel with a refinement of the instrument of knowledge. Thought (pensee) always was and remains the chief instrument of knowledge. Just as thought is necessary to compare, to correct, and to evaluate the crude data furnished by our senses, it remains the guiding factor also in the most refined methods of modern experimenta- tion. Thought, though controlling experience and experiment, is not in- dependent; it is immanent in experience, forming and transforming itself with experience, (pensee immanente a 1'experience qui se forme et se transformed avec elle). PETER EPP OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 232</page><page sequence="2">DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 233 Die Einheit des Erkenntnisproblems. VON KARL BOLDT. Neue philosophische Forschungen, Heft I. Leipzig, 0. R. Reisland, I937. PP. i64. Beginning with what promises to be a f resh critical attack upon the problem of the classification of the sciences, the author arrives at a neo- Leibnizian construction on a Kantian basis. The basic concepts for the classification of the sciences, super-, sub- and coordination, prove to be aspects of monads; and the subject-object correlationship of objectivity turns out to be grounded in the unity of consciousness. The author has read widely on the philosophy of science, but he makes little use of the technique of logic that is necessary really to show the structure and the interrelations of the sciences. His belief that he has provided a more presuppositionless point of departure for philosophy than has heretofore been achieved is not justified. MARVIN FARBER UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO Contingence, liberty et la personnalite humaine. Par HtLENE KONCZEWSKA. Paris, J. Vrin, I937. PP. ii, I92. The author starts her study with a discussion of the principle of indeterminacy in modern physics. She rejects the opinion frequently ex- pressed that the physical facts on which the principle of indeterminacy is based may be used as an argument for the philosophic theory of inde- terminism. The principle of indeterminacy, according to the author, means only that a physicist cannot accurately measure position and velocity of a particle at the same time. This, however, is merely a limitation of measure- ment; a perfectly objective and accurate measurement of both the position and the velocity of a particle becomes impossible by the fact that a physicist through his measurement introduces a disturbing factor. The disturbance does not result from the particle itself; it cannot be said that a particle itself behaves arbitrarily as if it were endowed with a free will. As far as the non-human world is concerned, the author believes that determinism is still valid; no comfort can be derived from modern physical theories for the belief in human freedom. It is determinism in the non-human world which makes human freedom possible and meaningful. Human freedom is synonymous with activity. Man is free means that he is a centre of action. In the non-human world events occur or do not occur; there are no "possible" events. In the human world it is different; a human being endowed with memory and anticipation can conceive, at any particular time, of several "possible" courses of action. The factor which transforms one of these possible actions into a real action lies in the human being itself, in his choice. This is all that the idea of human freedom really means. PETER Epp OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Metaphysik der Biologie von heute. Die Fragen des Lebensprinzips und der Lebensentwicklung und die neuere Fdrschung. Von ALOYS WENZL. Leipzig, Felix Meiner, 1937. PP. 58. This book holds that organic activity exhibits itself as "end-seeking" and therefore must be regarded under the aspect of final causation, but that</page><page sequence="3">234 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVIII. the concept of entelechy does not contradict the evolutionary hypothesis. The author considers the ascending gradations of reality from protons and electrons to atoms, living cells, plants, animals and finally man, so that the lawfulness of life appears not as a specifically developed field within the ordered domain of physics; but conversely physical events appear as the simplest manifestations of an organic totality. However, man is differen- tiated from the other organic forms in that the environing conditions of his essential nature are not the material ones of the spatio-temporal world, but are rather the intelligible realm of ends and values. The net result of this excellent book is to indicate that man's modern attempt to obey the Socratic dictum at present falls short of even the Stoic level of attainment. LEWIS M. HAMMOND UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Paroles d'un sage. Choix de pensees d'African Spir. Nouvelle edition. Par HtLENE CLAPAREDE-SPIR. Paris, Felix Alcan, i938. Pp. 74. This little book is a collection of aphorisms dealing with problems of ethics, religion, war and peace. The short aphorisms are not logically connected. There are, however, a few ideas which run through most of them. What our civilization lacks, African Spir says, is a soul, a spiritual unity, a true foundation. Our great material achievements are nothing but an artificial facade. Knowing the laws of nature man has externally become a master of the forces of nature; internally, however, he has remained a slave. But the author is not without hope. Humanity has produced men like Napoleon who were willing to plunge half of the globe into fire and blood merely to gratify their own sense of power; but humanity has also produced truly divine individuals, "vraiment divins". These divine spirits prove the presence of the absolute in the bosom of humanity. PETER Epp OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Histoire de la logique et de la philosophte scientifique. Actes du congress international de philosophic scientifique. Sorbonne, Paris, I935. Vol. VIII. Herman &amp; Cie, i936. Pp. ii, 96. Volume VIII of the transactions of this Congress is devoted to historical articles on Logic and Empiricism. The analogies which Mlle. Reymond finds between Stoic logic and Russell's are highly interesting, although the danger of representing discoveries of ancient philosophies by modern symbolism renders such analogies not a little remote. Of great importance, however, is the account of the scientific remains of Gottlob Frege. Among the articles on the history of Empiricism, special attention should be given to the little known works of the Scandinavian philosophers, of which a good account is given by J6rgen Jorgensen. Professor Phillip Frank's article about the relations between empiricism and dialectical ma- terialism is too brief to give the reader a clear idea of the nature of the official philosophy of Soviet Russia, although he calls attention to the im- portant differences between that system and dialectical idealism on the one hand, and to the striking analogies between it and empiricism on the other. JULIUS RUDOLPH WEINBERG OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY</page><page sequence="4">No. 2.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 235 Kierkegaard. Con una scelta di passi nuovamente tradotti, una bibliografia, e due tavole fuori testo. Per FRANCO LOMBARDI. Firenze, "La Nuova Italia" Editrice, I936. PP. 328. This book gives a concise and at the same time vivid exposition, for the Italian reader, of the spiritual development of Kierkegaard. For Kierkegaard philosophy was not merely a matter of knowledge. He himself says that he longed for a principle of life, for a truth and an idea for which he could live and die. What else can truth be if it is not to live for an idea, "il vivre per una idea"? This truth he found in his experience of the union with the divine. Kierkegaard tells us that he remembers the day, even the hour, when in his soul the indescribable joy of renewed communion with the divinity broke forth, when he felt again rooted in the divine, "radicato nel divino". Mr. Lombardi has a warm appreciation of the personality of Kierkegaard. This fact makes the reading of his book a great pleasure. PETER EPP OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Edmond Goblot, 1858-I935: La vie, l'ceuvre. PAR JEAN KERGOMARD, PIERRE SALZI, FRANgoIs GOBLOT. Paris, Felix Alcan, I937. Pp. viii, 2i6. Over I50 pages of this book are devoted to the life of Edmond Goblot. The two short essays that follow, "Le logicien et ses decouvertes" by Pierre Salzi, and "Le philosophe" by Frangois Goblot, give a sketch of Goblot's position and situate him clearly with respect to Kant and Comte. A critical estimate of the value of this logical positivism, as compared, for example, with the philosophy of Cournot or Boutroux, is noticeably lacking. A vivid picture of the life of a university professor in provincial France is conveyed, and the important influence Goblot exercised on the national school system, particularly through his musical activities, is fully described. ROBERT JAQUES TORONTO, CANADA Metodi compiti e limiti delta psicologia nello studio e nella prevenzione delta delinquenza. Per AGOSTINO GEMELLI. Milano, Societa Editrice "Vita e pensiero", I936. Pp. xiv, 156. The author has gathered together in one volume four essays having the same aim and purpose: to show the superiority of the Catholic attitude on criminology to that of either the Positive or Classical School. The Catholic attitude is based on an attempt to rehabilitate human liberty, while the Positive School occupies itself with judicial entities to the exclusion of the criminal, and the Classical School or Anthropological Criminology is deter- ministic, postulating that the criminal has a different structure, and affirm- ing that crime is always the expression of a morbid condition or a manifes- tation of an inherited degenerative state. The four essays are entitled: (I) The Prevention of Crime According to Anthropological Criminology, (2) The Italian Penal Code of Rocco and the Postulates of his Anthropo- logical Criminology, (3) The Application of Differential Psychology to the Study of Crime, (4) The Task of Psychology in the Study of Crime.

Pp. Vi, 204. This slight work does not concern itself with the role imagination plays in literature and philosophy; it presents a compilation of psychological facts largely drawn from the works of Ribot, Dugas, Queyrat, and Binet. The material, which is not new, may be found in many other sources. The author emphasizes the importance of kinaesthetic, auditory, and visual images in the creation of music, painting, and the sciences, which may induce us to recall the following: Imagination, which dost often steal The outer world from us, and not a shrill Is heard, tho' close a thousand trumpets peal, Who wakes thee if the senses all are still? ROBERT JAQUES TORONTO, CANADA La pedagogia di Antonio Rosmini e le sue basic filosofiche. Per MARIO CASOTTI. Milano, Societat Editrice "Vita e Pensiero", 1937. Pp. viii, 192. This book gives an account of Rosmini's theory of education, showing his relation to scholastic and Kantian philosophy, and how he combines the educational theories of the Church, especially the Ignatian, with those of the moderns. Rosmini's theory of education is ethical and religious in nature, and this treatment divides it into its aim, content, and method. The essential object of education is to love and understand God. The arts and sciences are not ends in themselves but ancillary studies, and only those subjects should be taught that contribute to the main purpose of education. The correct method is to start the child with the most universal concepts and gradually have them become precise and particular. SALVATORE Russo AUBURN, NEW YoRx Dictionnaire de spirituality. Fascicule VII. Paris, Gabriel Beauchesne et ses fils, 1937. PP. 240. Section VII of this important Dictionnaire, which treats primarily of asceticism and mysticism, and which is under the editorship of Marcel Viller, S.J., covers subjects from "Cabasilas" to "Cassien". It happens that this section does not contain articles of peculiar importance for persons interested in Philosophy. The article on Character is perhaps the most important one from the point of view of ethics and philosophy. It is written by Gustave Thibon, who is author of a book on Character-La science du caractere. He is well versed in the German writers in this field, but he is not acquainted with English and American writers on the subject. The other important article is on Calvin et Calvinisme. It is written by Joseph Dedieu and occupies twenty-seven columns. It is marked by fairness of judgment and extensive research but, quite naturally, contrasts Calvin's doctrine unfavorably with that of Catholicism. RUFUS M. JONES HAVERFORD COLLEGE</page><page sequence="6">No. 2.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 237 Philosophie de la religion. Par PAUL ORTEGAT, S. J. Bruxelles, L'edition universelle, S. A., I938. PP. 480. This is an ambitious and on the whole well-written work which aims to give a fairly complete historical and critical survey of the basic problems of the philosophy of religion from a Roman Catholic viewpoint. Professor Ortegat believes that religion is both social and individual and that it con- cerns the entire make-up of man, his reason, emotions, and will. He believes also that in the long run it must form the basis of any morality worthy of its name, and that all our thinking must suffer if its ontological implications are forgotten or neglected. The different chapters are of very unequal merit. Some, like the one on Kant, are quite good; others, like those on William James and the in- tuitionists, strike me as quite the reverse. The chapter on Nietzsche shows an understanding and a sympathy which not everyone might expect from an author with Professor Ortegat's background. The author is a firm believer in an ontological proof for the existence of God; this being the case, it is perhaps not surprising that his treatment of the problem of evil suffers from all the major weaknesses of the Hegelian "solution" which Professor Ortegat criticizes severely and, as I think, quite justly. Anyone who, like myself, considers the problem of evil the major problem of the philosophy of religion will probably take a rather critical view of Professor Ortegat's achievements in this particular work. SVEN NILSoN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT Naturalism in American Education. By GEOFFREY O'CONNELL. New York, Benziger Bros., i938. Pp. 286. The author has made a searching examination of the growth of naturalism for the past four hundred years, culminating in a marked trend in Ameri- can education of the present, and concludes that naturalism, as a monistic philosophy, is determining the trend of education in both our public schools and our teacher-training institutions. He favors a dualism in education, allowing for both the natural and the supernatural. To him, "supernatural" evidently means the orthodox position of the Roman Catholic Church. For those who are not likely to accept this extreme position, there remains con- siderable value in his trenchant criticism, especially of the leaders of educa- tional thought in Teachers College of Columbia University. R. H. JORDAN CORNELL UNIVERSITY Towards An Objective Ethics. By GEORGE R. GEIGER. Yellow Springs, The Antioch Press, 1938. PP. x, 88. In the moral anarchy of our time Mr. Geiger sees the need of a more objective ethics to provide authoritative standards for all. These standards are to be objective not in the sense of a metaphysical absolute, but of con- crete social needs. Ethics becomes objective by directing attention to social problems and social reconstruction. Objective ethics is critical, employing reflective deliberation and choice; it is overt, translating ideas into action;</page><page sequence="7">238 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL.

Of these four militant Catholic works in the field of social and political thought, only the first is a serious historical study; the other three are cam- paigning material. Father Jarlot gives a well-documented survey of the early history of French corporativism from i88o or i885 under the influ- ence of Le Play and La Tour du Pin, to the beginnings of the Semaines sociales in 1904. Of the critical years of the War and its aftermath he has surprisingly little to say, but he plainly regards the centralizing tendencies of the present as preparing the way for the corporative regime of the future, which is to be hierarchical yet "decentralized". Individualism and "the sovereignty of numbers" are to be denied in favor of the essentially mediaeval professional association, culminating in a national council of corporations. Except for minor details, all this seems to fit into Fascism rather than into French democracy and individualism. HAROLD A. LARRABEE UNION COLLEGE Diderot, Interpreter of Nature. Selected Writings. Translated by JEAN STEWART and JONATHAN KEMP. Edited, with an Introduction, by JONA- THAN KEMP. New York, International Publishers, 1938. PP. viii, 358. Diderot is in the Communist canon; his Nihil obstat is signed by Marx, his Imprimatur by Lenin. "Modern dialectical materialism and the new humanism of Marxism is the spiritual heir of Diderot", says our editor; and "the study of his work is essential for the proper understanding of dialectical materialism". The selections in this book are therefore chosen primarily for the instruction of the faithful. But unbelievers should not be deterred from reading these often unfamiliar bits of Diderot, in deft and tripping translation. That rare mind! That volcano of ideas, in perpetual eruption!

He had a destructive significance for the metaphysics of volition comparable to that which Kant had for the meta- physics of reason. His essential contribution resides in the extension of criticism into the moral and cultural sphere. The present work not only bears witness to the painstaking industry of the author, but will occupy a distinctive place in the Nietzsche literature. Exhaustive proof is offered that in Zarathustra not only the language is poetical, but that it has a care- fully weighted architectonic structure, and that form and content mutually condition and illuminate each other. The aesthetic form of the work serves as a key to open its didactic content. It is closely related to the musical technique of Nietzsche's erstwhile friend, Richard Wagner. HERMAN HAUSHEER LAMONI, IOWA A Vision. By W. B. YEATS. New York, The Macmillan Company, I938. PP. viii, 306. This is a very remarkable book which, in the quality of some of its prose and in its use of symbolism, can be compared to nothing in English literature except perhaps to the shorter works of Sir Thomas Browne. It is the work of a consummate literary artist, a man of unusual clarity of mind, and a poet, yet it is based on communications from the author's wife through automatic writing and by speech in sleep and trance. To express the phases of human personality and human history, it makes use of a symbolism as formal and remote as that which descended by devious routes from the early Greek philosophers to the mages of the Renaissance, yet, for all its formalism, the logic is that of poetry rather than of philosophy, and the symbolism has a validity, if only because it has provided a mould for the thought of one of the most sensitive minds of modern times.

The book gives parallel Latin and French texts of the Tractatus de in- tellectus emendatione.

BAUER, ABEL REY. Sixieme semaine international de synthese. Paris, Felix Alcan, I938. Pp. i88. A number of scientists and philosophers gather together to contribute such ideas as will have bearing on the meaning of the term "progress". Hubert is convinced that the term is meaningless apart from some concep- tion of improvement; Ferrero finds this factor in the gradual elimination of fear; Le Roy thinks of progress as being essentially a matter of intellectual advance, hence he attempts to formulate a logic of discovery; others search the realms of abnormal psychology, biology, and physics. Abel Rey, to whom is assigned the task of summarizing the discussion, is unable to find in the notion of progress anything but an anthropomorphic subjectivism which views all advancement from the perspective of a privileged axis. This axis for M. Rey himself is "the dignity of thought and the dignity of love, of which the dignity of man is made". A.
