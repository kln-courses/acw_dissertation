Of these manifestations, the failure of father-son relationships is that which most clear- ly symbolizes as well as indicates and, to a large extent, precipitates man's isolation from God. Alienation-from-the-self, which partially results from man's abandonment of the idea of God, is also closely related to these father- son ruptures, and these are the two types of alienation that stem most im- mediately from loss of faith and the recognition of the absurd that such a loss is both a result of and entails. The father, like a king or star, is a secular emblem of God, particularly to a child, over whom the father's power, like God's, is seemingly absolute. And in the fiction of Dostoyevsky, Faulkner, and Camus, for example, the feeling that one has been abandoned by the father often parallels the feeling of having been abandoned by God, the absence of the father usually corresponds to the absence of any sense of or faith in God, and indifference to or rejection of the father is mirrored in a character's indifference to or rejection of the idea of God. Thinking of his father, Camus' Meursault recalls in The Stranger , "I never set eyes on him. Perhaps the only things I really knew about him were what mother had told me." Meursault had been abandoned by his father in his infancy; after he murders the arab, he reveals his complete lack of faith and total indifference to the idea of God to an absolutely incredulous magistrate and to a chiding prison chaplain: "I said I saw no point in troubling my head about the matter; whether I believed or didn't was, to my mind, a question of so little importance," he recollects. Significantly, the prosecutor concludes his case against Meursault by telling the jury, "I am convinced [. . .] that you will not find I am exaggerating the case against the prisoner when I say that he is also guilty of the murder to be tried tomorrow in this court," which is "that most odi- ous of crimes, the murder of a father by his son." Meursault has long since slain God, to whom he is as indifferent as he is to the memory of his father, in his 56</page><page sequence="2">heart; while it is logically and practically absurd, the prosecutor's summation, as Rhein notes, reveals this aspect of Meursault's trial's symbolic meaning.1 Tarrou, an avowed atheist who rediscovers in Camus' The Plague that "It is in the thick of calamity that one gets hardened to the truth - in other words, to [God's] silence,"2 is disillusioned in his father, who must supervise the ex- ecution of criminals in his capacity of prosecuting attorney, when, as a child, he goes to court and hears his father demand the death penalty for an offender. Nearly a year later Tarrou leaves home on the eve of a prospective execution, rejecting his father as he will later reject that God whom he feels condemns all men to death. Ever since his disillusionment, as Friedman notes, "Tarrou's chief aim in life has been to side with the 'victims' rather than the 'executioners,' "3 and he thus fights on the losing side in the Spanish Civil War, i.e., against God and the king. In Faulkner's works, fathers who are estranged from their atheistic or doubt- ing sons, most notably Sutpen and McEachern, are suggestively portrayed as God-like figures or self-styled representatives of the divinity. Dostoyevsky also indicates that alienation from the father is reciprocally related to rejection of the idea of God. Just as Meursault has been abandoned by his father, Sutpen refuses to recognize Charles (and is, as a consequence, estranged from Henry), and Charles in turn refuses to acknowledge his son; Mr. Compson is cynically detached from Quentin and Jason; Hightower is kept at a distance by his father; Stepan Verhovensky abandons Pyotr; and Fyodor Karamazov refuses to recognize Smerdyakov while he ignores and mistreats Dmitri, Ivan, and Alyosha. Somewhat similarly, Stavrogin, the Underground Man, and Raskol- nikov, like Christmas, appear to have been partially orphaned by their father's deaths. Just as Meursault is symbolically guilty of patricide, Ivan desires to, Dmitri attempts to, and Smerdyakov does kill Fyodor, while Christmas, and Joanna Burden's father and grandfather, like Tarrou, are adolescent runaways. All Charles Bon requires of Sutpen is the slightest hint of recognition, "a sheet, a scrap of paper with the word 'Charles' in his hand [. . .] or a lock of his hair or a pairing of his fingernails" or for one of Charles' love letters to Judith to be intercepted and returned unopened. Yet Charles receives no positive material sign from Sutpen, just as he and Henry receive in the course of the war no hint from God that would signify His existence or His recogni- tion of the justice of the South's cause. When it is clear that the war is lost, Charles predicts, "It won't be much longer now and then there won't be anything left (...) not God; evidently we have done without Him for four years, only He just didn't notify us," and Henry later agrees that "God quit us four years ago only He never thought it necessary to tell us." Sutpen literally takes on the aspect of a God in Quentin's, Rosa's, and Wash's eyes; and Faulkner thus directly connects the loss of faith suffered by both his sons, Charles and Henry, to their conflicts with their father. Listening to Rosa's tale, Quentin envisions the construction of Sutpen's plantation in terms that echo Genesis: "out of the soundless Nothing (...) creating the 57</page><page sequence="3">Sutpen's Hundred, the Be Sutpen's Hundred like the oldentime Be Light." Mr. Compson suggests that Wash, regarding Sutpen's proud visage, muses "if God Himself were to come down and ride the natural earth , that's what He would aim to look like." And Quentin imagines that Rosa as a child "doubtless used to watch (Sutpen) from window or door as he passed unaware of her as she would have looked at God probably."4 While Charles is abandoned by Sutpen in his infancy because he is part black, Henry, the recognized son, repudiates his father twenty y?ars later because of his idealized friendship to Charles and his inability, in his ignorance of Charles' identity, to understand Sutpen's objection to Charles' and Judith's engagement. And just as Sutpen's crucial mistake in refusing to recognize his first-born son is repeated in the next generation in Charles' failure to fulfill a father's role vis-a-vis Charles Etienne, so too can Sutpen's own indifference to God (Rosa describes him as "a man who to my certain knowledge was never in a Jefferson church but three times in his life - the once when he first saw Ellen, the once when they rehearsed the wedding, the once when they performed it."5), like that of his sons, be traced back to his having severed relations with his father, a widower and a drunkard, in having run away from home at the age of thirteen. Quentin, who tells Sutpen's tale to Shreve and who, in The Sound and the Fury , recollects his father's remark "that Christ was not crucified: he was worn away by the minute clicking of little wheels" and later equates in his mind "Jesus walking on Galilee and Washington not telling lies," also suggests a hazy equation of his own father with the God in whom he doesn't believe in thinking, "I will am my fathers Progenitive I invented him created I him." And Mr. Compson clearly fails to act adequately as a father, preferring rather to retreat into the solace of his cynically stoic outlook and absurdist philosophy - which fatally infect his son - and the contents of his well-stocked side- board. Jason also bears the stamp of his father's cynical despair; he is "logical rational contained and even a philosopher in the old stoic tradition: thinking nothing whatever of God one way or the other." Benjy, of course, is incapable of conceptualizing the idea of God.6 "Calvin Burden was the son of a minister named Nathaniel Burrington. The youngest of ten children, he ran away from home at the age of twelve." The fact that Joanna's grandfather's father was a minister, particularly in the con- text of Light in August as a whole, suggests that Calvin's escape from his fami- ly is, like Tarrou's, also a rejection of God. Hightower's father is both a preacher and a doctor, and in his youth Hightower "would lie rigid, not even trembling, in his dark bed while the man who was his father and his only re- maining relative, and between whom and himself there was so much of dis- tance in time that not even the decades of years could measure, that there was not even any physical resemblance, slept walls and floors away." And High- tower - abandoned by his congregation and the hierarchy of his church and thus, symbolically, by God - with a reciprocal symbolism expresses his will to lose his faith through a loss of confidence in that church and those who 58</page><page sequence="4">govern it. "It seems to him that he has seen it all the while; that that which is destroying the Church is not the outward groping of those within it nor the in- ward groping of those without, but the professionals who control it and who have removed the bells from its steeples. He seems to see them, endless, with- out order, empty, symbolical, bleak, skypointed not with ecstasy or passion but in adjuration, threat, and doom." The emptiness of the steeples symbolizes for Hightower (who preaches in "the empty church" after his congregation for- sakes him) the emptiness of heaven; that they are in disorder also indicates the absence of God, the unifying and ordering principle. Finally, however, rather than abandon the concept of God completely, Hightower comes to recognize the vastness of the gulf between God and man (like that between himself and his father) when he sees "the supreme Face Itself," the face of God, as being "cold, terrible because of Its omniscient detachment."7 For Christmas, while under McEachern's care, "God had only occurred on Sunday. And then - save for the concomitant ordeal of cleanliness - it was music that pleased the ear and words that did not bother the ear at all - on the whole, pleasant if a little tiresome." However, Christmas' attitude towards re- ligion goes beyond indifference to rejection and hatred. He obstinately refuses to learn his catechism lessons as a child and likewise refuses to pray with Joanna Burden immediately before he murders her and curses God in a Negro church almost immediately afterwards. Christmas, who has never known his biologi- cal father, actually also murders his foster father, McEachern, a strict Calvinist who unsuccessfully tries to beat Christianity into his resistant charge. This quasi-patricide is doubly satisfying; for it is not only simultaneously an expres- sion of and the actual attainment of that freedom that the rejection of God im- plies, but it is also, and perhaps more importantly, the symbolic and final re- jection of the idea of God itself, as McEachern represents to Christmas that Calvinistic ethic against which he spontaneously and continuously rebels. At the moment when Christmas kills him, in fact, McEachern, in his outrage at finding his foster son at a barn dance, toward which "he believed that he had been guided (. . .) by some militant Michael Himself," feels himself to be "the actual representation of the wrathful and retributive Throne." Similarly, Christmas' grandfather, Doc Hines, another religious fanatic, believes that he is in communion with God and is doing God's work, that he is "the instrument of His will" in his dealings with both the infant Christmas, whom he kidnaps, and the adult Christmas, whom he feels should be lynched.8 Patricide is, of course, the primary plot concern in The Brothers Karamazov, and it is clearly related to the novel's philosophical center, the question of the death of God in the modern age. As Rysten points out, Camus followed Dostoyevsky in The Stranger when he had Meursault say: "All normal people had more or less desired the death of those they loved, at some time or another." Ivan Karamazov is more specific yet when he accuses everyone: "They all desire the death of their fathers." Those who do cannot adjust to the world's in- 59</page><page sequence="5">justice for which they hold a father figure responsible. In particular the theological aspect of patricide is stated and evaluated in the work of both authors. It is God, the Father, the Creator, who is responsible for a world in which children suffer and die. Ivan's refusal to accept the torture of innocent creatures as part of an In- spired and Harmonious Design is a central thought to The Plague (. . .)9 Friedman agrees that "to reject God the creator is to reject the Father, and for Ivan (...) this rejection may be linked with the fact that he hates his own father and consciously desires his death."10 And Slonim concurs that "Ivan's loathing of his father goes hand in hand with his rebellion against God."11 Ivan expressly comes to his ambivalent apostasy through contemplating the injustice of life and the senselessness of the suffering that men - and specifical- ly innocent children - endure. He has compiled a collection of stories concerning atrocities committed against Russian children that he recounts to Alyosha, as he states, "only to make my case clearer," and it is tempting to surmise that he is subconsciously so obsessed with the suffering of children, and uses this as his most compelling evidence in his argument against the ex- istence of God, because of the suffering and neglect he and his brothers en- dured as children at Fy odor's hands. When Ivan, while somewhat ambivalent, asserts that "there is no God," Fyodor, who "himself was far from being religious; he had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint," concurs that "it's more likely Ivan's right." Smerdyakov likewise uncritically accepts Ivan's precept that God doesn't exist: and, significantly, in this idea he finds the liberation from moral restraint that justifies his act of patricide.12 Fyodor had been a poor father to all his sons, having abandoned them all in their youth and contending with most of them in their maturity. Smerdyakov, the illegitimate son, is brought up as an orphan by Grigory and Marfa and takes the place of a servant in his own father's house. He is somewhat like Faulkner's Charles Bon in that Fyodor refuses to recognize him. While Fyodor was "turning his house into a sink of debauchery" after his first wife, Adelaida, had deserted him, "Grigory took the three-year-old Mitya into his care. If he hadn't looked after him there would have been no one even to change the baby's little shirt." Pyotr Alexandrovi tch, who had lodged a law suit against Fyodor over Adelaida's forest property, "used long afterward to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not understand what child he was talk- ing about, and even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house." Later, Dmitri is raised by his mother's relatives. "He saw and knew his father (...) for the first time on coming of age," when he had visited him to see about his mother's property, and "seems not to have liked his father, and made haste to get away." Dmitri is at loggerheads with Fyodor, who is cheating him, over both his inheritance and the affections of Grushenka. He asks at the gathering with Zossima, "Why is such a man alive? 60</page><page sequence="6">(. . .) Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth?" And he is termed a "parricide" by the buffoonish Fyodor on that occasion. After the death of Fyodor's second wife, Sophia, Ivan and Alyosha, like Dmitri before them, "were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father" and were raised by Grigory until another relative had arrived to take charge of them. Ivan "was in great straits for the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was studying. It must be noted that he did not even at- tempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt of him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that from such a father he would get no real assistance." Ivan later indicates to Alyosha that he, like Dmitri, "wishes" Fyodor's death. For all the sons save Alyosha, who finds a substitute father in the monk Zossima, the early rejection by their father results in their eventual rejection or doubt of the idea of God.13 The atheism of Stavrogin and Pyotr in The Possessed also coincides with their early abandonment by their fathers. Nicolay, who admits his atheism when pressed by Shatov, had been raised without a father; the only thing we are told about General Stavrogin is that he had separated from Varvara Petrovna in 1851 and had died four years later. Pyotr's mother was also living apart from her husband, Stepan, at the time of her death, when Pyotr was five years old and had been living alone with her in Paris for three years. "The child had, from the first, been sent back to Russia, where he was brought up in the charge of distant cousins in some remote region. (...) As for Stephen Trofimovitch's son, he had only seen him twice in his life, the first time when he was born and the second time lately in Petersburg, where the young man was preparing to enter the university." As does the Peter of Camus stage adaption of The Possessed , Dostoyevsky's Pyotr - whom the convict Fedka asserts "hasn't a ha'p'orth of belief in the Heavenly Creator, Who made us out of earthly clay; but says it's all the work of nature even to the last beast" - takes every opportunity to avenge himself cruelly on the father he feels had abandoned him in his infancy. Anton, the narrator, reveals that Stepan "had certainly been deeply wounded at his first meeting with Petrusha, by the way he had embraced him. It was a deep and genuine grief; at least in his eyes and to his heart." Pyotr further embarasses Stepan by divulging the delicate con- tents of his private letters before those whom they most intimately concern. He also shows certain confidential letters to Varvara Petrovna and boasts of hav- ing exposed Stepan to his platonie mistress and benefactress. He calls his father, "a parasite" and "a voluntary flunkey too lazy to work," and he laughs at the love letters Varvara has shown him, terming them "shameful and disgusting." Pyotr continues to goad Stepan until he succeeds in finally receiv- ing his outraged father's curse.14 And neither the Underground Man nor Raskolnikov have fathers. Ap- parently an orphan, the Underground Man complains to Liza, "If I had had a home from childhood, I shouldn't be what I am now. (...) However bad it may be at home, anyway there are your father and mother, and not enemies, strangers." Having had a typical Dostoyevskian up-bringing, he writes, "I was sent to the school by distant relations, upon whom I was dependent and of 61</page><page sequence="7">whom I have heard nothing since." And now, as he composes his Notes , the Underground Man has abandoned any hope of finding God, but observes, rather, that "every primary cause draws after itself another still more primary, and so on to infinity."15 Although Raskolnikov has a mother and a sister, he has no father; his fami- ly's desperate financial situation, which had forced Dounia to take a morally questionable post in Svidrigailov's house, suggests that the family has been without a male head for at least several years. And although he infrequently evinces a tenuous inclination to believe, Raskolnikov's atheism, while dual- iste, is clear. The philosophical rationalizations that underlie his crime are in themselves totally at odds with belief in a Christian God, as his wonderfully ironic remark, "if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no do- ing anything,"16 indicates. Church argues that, instead of a biological father, Raskolnikov relates "to the authoritarian world of the father figure (. . . Who) is threatening, cruel, and austere. For Raskolnikov he is represented by the nameless men who exploit Sonia, by Svidrigailov, who has insulted Dounia, by the man who is following the drunken girl, by Luzhin, whose motives in proposing to Dounia are purely selfish, and later by the police. All these figures are summed up in Raskolnikov's dream of the man who beats the mare to death."17 Thus Raskolnikov's associations with father figures are as negative as are his attitudes towards the authoritarian God of Russian Orthodoxy. Moreover, particularly in the Underground Man, Raskolnikov, Stavrogin, Ivan and Dmitri Karamazov, Quentin and Jason Compson, and Christmas, the failure of the father-son relationship combines with the initial sense of God's absence to contribute to yet another mode of alientation, alienation- from-the-self . Friedman argues that "the father is the first and often the most lasting image of man for the son. It not infrequently happens, however, that the father is not really present for the son, either because he is dead or absent or inattentive, or because he is in no sense a father, or because he is too weak or despicable for a son to be able to emulate him." In those cases where the father is a physical, even a perversely dominant presence, however, the son in- evitably receives from him a share of his personality; and the son is estranged from and rejects a part of himself to the extent that he is estranged from and re- jects the father. Also, "the inner division which results from the alienation be- tween fathers and sons is as much a commentary on the absence of a modern image of man as on the breakdown of the specific father-son relationship. At the heart of this breakdown, in fact, is the inability of the father to give his son a direction-giving image of meaningful and authentic human existence." To a large extent, man's image of his ideal self and his anthropomorphic image of God coincide. The rejection of this image of God inevitably erodes the con- comitant image of man, and the father cannot provide his son with a direction- giving image of man if, having abandoned his idea of God, as Fyodor, Sutpen, and Mr. Compson have, he has no coherent image of man himself. In modern existentialist fiction, then, as the works of these authors illustrate, the problem of alienation, a crisis of identity, is seen in terms of a larger, religious crisis; 62</page><page sequence="8">and the relationship between fathers and sons is the focal point where these two crises most clearly connect, both causally and symbolically.18 Notes 'Albert Camus, The Stranger, trans, by Stuart Gilbert, Vintange Books (New York: Alfred A.
