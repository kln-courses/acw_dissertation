Some acknowledge a similarity to its use in Hel- lenistic theology; the analogue, frequently, is Philo.1 There is general agreement that, although the propriety of God's action in Christ is not explained clearly in the letter, it refers to the divine nature; the sense is that God's action in Christ was appropriate because it was right for God to do this.2 1 C.

They interpret npénsiv with a view to human necessity rather than divine.3 Harold Attridge, for example, writes: The use of the term in this context is a rather bold move, since in Greek and Greco- Jewish theology it would not have been thought "proper" to associate God with the world of suffering. Propriety here is not a consequence of God's nature, but of human needs and the salvifìc action that meets them.4 This analysis shows well how attempts to capture the correct sense of Tipénsiv have struggled to account for its peculiar usage without sacrificing serious attention to the author's wider thought- world. As attractive as this interpretation is for its balance, it does not account for other statements about God's passion in the letter (3:11; 4:3; 10:30-31; 12:29). Presumably these would have been as offensive to Greek or Greco- Jewish theology.5 Also, such an explanation is better suited to the use of Ttpéneiv in 7:26. At Heb 2:10 npénsiv describes God's participation in Jesus' passion and death. The purpose of Jesus' perfection through suffering was not simply justice or moral rectitude, so the writer does not merely state what was right. This does not deny any relationship to God's justice. Rather it stresses how the author conceived this salvific action in a wider context. The propriety of God's action in Jesus serves another purpose: to help the readers appreciate the decisive significance of his death. ílpénsiv in 2:10 functions within the letter's passion apologetic.6 The present study argues that the composer of Hebrews was influenced by the notion of propriety in rhetoric, when noting how fitting it was for God to perfect Jesus through suffering. Because the rhetorical concept of xò rtpéttov is concerned with what is appropriate to the speaker and the audi- ence alike, it can accommodate both of the main emphases previous inter- pretations have had to choose between. Also, with respect to audience 3 B. F.

R. Williamson ( Jews in the Hellenistic World [Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1989] 79) points out: "For Philo there is only one thing worse than anthropomorphism and that is anthropopathism." Actually, the author of Hebrews moves away from this tradition, and comes closer to the notion of God's involvement in suffering represented in the paideia tradition (see 12:4-13). For a Jewish appropriation of that tradition see 2 Macc 6:12-17. For the involvement of gods in human suffering in Greek theology see Sam K.

As Hebrews links unfaithfulness with an inability to be persuaded, the propriety of God's role in Jesus' perfection argues for a more persuasive object of faith. Showing God to have been suitably close to Jesus' suffering and stressing the superiority of Jesus' mediation function to provide a more convincing argument for the salvific character of his death. Furthermore, as commentators have recognized the rhetorical aspects of the letter for some time and continue to do so, it is well to consider how rhetoric may not have been confined to the author's style alone, but may have affected the theology of the letter, too.7 To my knowlege, the rhetorical sense of xò npénov has not been studied in relation to this verse.8 I. Propriety in Rhetoric Treatises on ancient rhetoric stress the need for propriety in speech, and students of rhetoric generally agree on its meaning and function. Tò npércov connotes a harmonious balance among three things: the speaker, the audi- ence, and the speech.9 This virtue of style eludes exact definition because of the variables involved. It seems to require as much aesthetic intuition as 7 On the author's rhetorical skill see B.

Regarding the relation of rhetoric and thought, there is a parallel in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, whose rhetorical training carried over to his writing of history. W. Kendrick Pritchett ( Dionysius of Halicarnassus: On Thucydides. English TYanslation Based on the Greek Text of Usener- Rademacher, with Commentary [Berkeley/ Los Angeles/ London: University of California, 1975] xxviii) claims, "Dionysius did not put his rhetoric and his history into separate com- partments; he is remarkably consistent. Dionysius composed his own history, the Roman An- tiquities, according to patterns of thinking which were natural to a rhetor and grammaticus. . . . A training in rhetoric might be expected to produce a rhetorical mind.** See also E. Auerbach, Mimesis (Princeton: Princeton University, 1953) 33-40, and J. W. Duff, Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age (London: T. J. Unwin, 1960) 20-33. 8 Moffatt ( Epistle to the Hebrews, 29) comes close to it when he cites Eth. Nic. 4.2.2 (1 122a): xò Jtpénov Bý' aùxóv, Kai êv &lt;J&gt;, Kai nepi õ, a text which shows how the doctrine of the mean even affected Aristotle's understanding of rhetorical propriety. Moffatt applies the text to the moral nature of God, but does not make the connection to rhetoric. On the mean and propriety in Aristotle's Rhetoric see J. F.

Plato refers to it frequently, yet scholars credit Aristotle for making propriety prominent among the virtues of style.10 From Aristotle to Quin- tilian it grows in importance to the extent that C. O. Brink believes the discussion of style, from the Hellenistic period on, was largely shaped by the rhetorical criterion of propriety. 11 For our purposes it will be enough to examine the basic notion in Aristotle and to highlight certain aspects of subsequent treatments. Aristotle does not define propriety as much as he describes how to achieve it: Propriety of speech (xò npénov) will be obtained by the expression of emotion and character, and by proportion to the subject matter. . . . Appropriate style also makes the fact appear credible; for the mind of the hearer is imposed upon under the impression that the speaker is speaking the truth, because in such circumstances, his feelings are the same, so that he thinks (even if it is not the case as the speaker puts it) that things are as he represents them; and the hearer always sympathizes with one who speaks emotionally, even though he really says nothing.12 Careful attention to the key elements of fjôoç, náGoç, and áv&amp;koyov produces the proper syle.13 A speaker who conveys moral authority and expresses emotion achieves propriety when both dispose the listeners to a 10 Plato: Apol. 17C; Gorg. 485B; Parm. 136D; Prot. 312B; Charm. 158C; Ale. 135C; Aristotle: Eud.

Equally important to portray is the speaker's character, for the way it can disclose moral purpose.15 When these things are attended to, another function of appropriate style is guaranteed: it makes facts credible.16 Thus, the speech is more persuasive and effective.17 Found in the proper use of metaphor and in the suitable contraction and amplification of a subject, propriety should be natural and not strained.18 Furthermore, Aristotle suggests, it is best accomplished when it goes unnoticed. That way the style of the speaker or writer fulfills its function unobtrusively.19 Cicero clarifies the meaning of propriety when he distinguishes between "right" and "appropriate." The place of the former is philosophy, whereas the latter is at home in rhetoric. "Right" concerns itself with universal obliga- tions, "appropriate" with particular dispositions. The former is governed by moral dictates, which guide the individual conscience, whereas the latter is exercised by a wider sense of justice which enjoys more latitude in articu- lating what is agreeable or fit at a particular moment. "Right" is more con- cerned with the agent, whereas "appropriate" encompasses both speaker and audience alike. Decorum aims at achieving balance, harmony, and proportionality so that what the speaker says resonates with the listeners, leading them to a judgment of propriety.20 The significance of the distinction lies in the dif- ference between intellectual assent and genuine persuasion. To judge what one hears as "right" requires less personal involvement than a judgment that something is "appropriate." Thus, for Cicero, propriety encompasses not only words but actions as well. Whereas "right" indicates "duty," something 14 E. M. Cope, An Introduction to Aristoie's Rhetoric (repr. Dubuque, I A: Brown, n.d.) 298. 15 Rhet. 3.16.8 (1417a). Elsewhere, Aristotle claims that persuasive speech renders the speaker dÇiónioToç, and that the moral character of the speaker is "the most effective means of proof" {Rhet. 1.2.4 [1356a]). 16 Although the example is negative, it shows the influence propriety has: through artifice, sympathetic feelings can be elicited from an audience even fallaciously, if the listeners believe the words of the speaker are authoritative and accurately represent what they feel or would feel in the situation being described. 17 See F.

Therefore, by fo- cusing on what a person says or does in relation to others at a given moment, propriety attends more specifically to an individual's character and moral purpose as suited to a given situation.21 For Quintilian, achieving propriety {decorum, aptum , proprietas) in speech is not only a matter of selecting an appropriate style. Whereas pre- vious discussions of suitable style dealt with the creation of an impression through carefully crafted words, Quintilian believes well presented facts can create even greater impression than verbal artifice alone.22 By well presented facts he means more than what is expedient. When a speaker is a wordsmith, capable of artfully rendering the particulars of the situation, propriety of style is observed. The listeners affirm what is said with more than just their minds, for the speaker has elicited an emotional response that confirms the truth of what they hear. The difference in Quintiliano understanding of propriety is, in part, the result of how he understands the person of the orator. The veracity of the speaker's words is enhanced when Vi0oç is in- volved, "For a man's character is generally revealed and the secrets of his heart are laid bare by his manner of speaking. . . ."23 Propriety, then, helps rhetoric to fulfill its function in Quintilian's view: to produce a vir bonus dicendi peritus, for the character of the speaker plays an important role in the effectiveness of speech.24 Now this must be examined more in detail. Propriety and Persuasion In the midst of his discussion of propriety, Aristotle notes that an appro- priate style renders facts more credible.25 Even though he speaks negatively about orators who are able to draw their listeners into false conclusions, his point illustrates the power of propriety in speech.26 Ironically, propriety governs both the proper and improper use of rhetoric.27 Still, it is evident 21 Or. 22.1 A.

In an- other place he lists xò niGavòv èie xoö npénovxoç, persuasiveness resulting from propriety, among those things which enhance style.28 The link between the two derives from the nature and function of rhetoric. Every rhetorical venture seeks to persuade the audience on the basis of something more than mere logic.29 From the time of Plato's Górgias , rhet- oricians have valued the import of a speaker's character (ijOoę) as well as the ability to convey emotion (ná 0oç) in moving an audience to a particular conclusion.30 Understood in this way, rhetoric elicits conviction differently from dialectic; rhetoric operates with a wider scope. Thus the speaker is persuasive not because the logic of ideas has been demonstrated, but rather because in the meeting between speaker and audience there is a recognition of truth, compelling as much for the way the speaker articulates it as for what is said. Rendering the listeners sympathetic depends on propriety to guar- antee a qualitative intersubjective meeting between speaker and audience.31 Regardless of the facts, without propriety in style and expression, their value is diminished if the audience has not been convinced. Demonstrating proof (rtícmç) effectively requires propriety. As the function of rcíaxiç in rhetoric is deliberative, proofs address probabilities rather than certainties.32 They are also aimed at the whole 28 Rhet. 3.12.6 (1414a). Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentions how propriety aids in per- suasiveness in De Lys. 9, 13; De Isoc. 2.

Paul Ricoeur ( The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language [Toronto: University of Toronto, 1975] 29) locates the difference between rhetoric and dialectic in rhetoric's intersubjective quality. That prevents it from becoming purely argumen- tative or logical, because it deals with the character of the speaker and the mood of the audience, as well as the logic of the argument. Who is speaking is as important as what is being said, and the manner of the speaker is equally critical (Aristotle, Rhet. 3.1.2.). On this basis, Ricoeur argues for a connection between style (Xéqiç) and proof (rcíaxiç) (ibid., 31). For the meaning of rtíoxiç in Aristotle see Grimaldi, Rhetoric I, 349-56. 30 Gorg. 458E-461 A; Aristotle, Rhet. 1.2.3 (1356a), 9.1-2 (1366a); 2.1.2 (1377b); 3.17.12 (1418b). 31 See Bryant, "Rhetoric," 404-15; idem, "The Rhetorical Tradition II: Emotion, Style, and Literary Association," Quarterly Journal of Speech 36 (1950) 326-28; Grimaldi, Rhetoric I, 350. 32 Aristotle, Rhet. 1.2.1 (1355b); Quintilian, Inst.

One can argue, then, for a link between style (XéÇiç) and proof (niaxiç) on the basis of propriety (xò npénov).34 Both share a common purpose in bringing an audience to judgment, for, when style is fitted to i"i0oç, ná 0oç, and Xóyoç, those three methods of proof have been attended to as well.35 II. ripénsiv in Hebrews 2:10 The use of npéneiv in Heb 2:10 fits the pattern found in classical Greek. Regularly, the finite verb form is used impersonally, sometimes taking an infinitive clause as its subject and an indirect object.36 The object is the person or thing to whom propriety is attributed, and the subject attests to the action described as fitting. Here, the subject of Snpsnev is tòv àpxtjyòv xfjç a(DTT|píaç aòxcov 8ià rcaôimáxíúv xsXsuõaai and the indirect object is ctòxq). A subordinate clause, 8ť ôv xà náv ta Kai 6ť oö xà rtávxa, qualifies the 33 The moxeiç intrinsic to rhetoric are three: logical, ethical, and emotional ( Rhet . 1.2.3 [1356a]). See Grimaldi, Rhetoric I, 351-52; Kennedy, The Art of Persuasion , 90-103; Kinneavy, Greek Rhetorical Origins , 46. While kíoxiç in Aristotle may resist a univoca] meaning, later rhetoricians agree that the níoxeiç čvre^voi are concerned with the logical, ethical, and emotional. Dionysius of Hali- carnassus, for example, mentions them in De Lys. 19, as do Quintilian (Inst. Orat. 1 1.3. 154) and Cicero (De Orat. 2.27.1 15). Both nícrxiç and propriety share common interests, for these same authors, as we have seen above, relate the three elements to propriety as well. Solmsen ("Ar- istotelian Tradition," 43) claims that propriety itself is subdivided in accordance with the three níoxeiç. When defining the three níoxeiç, Aristotle uses Xóyoç for the logical (Rhet. 1.2.3 [1356a]), but when describing the objects of propriety he substitutes npayna for it (Rhet. 3.7.1 [1408a]). That the forms of the níaxeiç and the objects of xò nptnov were somehow connected is evident in the way Dionysius of Halicarnassus transposes the Aristotelian logical category for xò npénov in his discussion of the three níoxeiç: xò npãy^a Kai xò JiáGoç Kai xò 10oç (De Lys. 19).

The antecedent of the relatives is Osóç in v 9.37 The other qualifying clause, noXXovq oíoòç się SóÇav áyayóvxa, is circumstantial rather than final.38 The question is, then, why in these circumstances was it fitting for God to perfect Jesus through suffering? Within the first seven chapters of the letter the author establishes a basis for the core of the letter's christological argument, beginning in 8:1 and running to 10: 18.39 Many of the themes and scriptural proofs of the first seven chapters are focused in the next section of the letter; so one cannot under- estimate the value of the preparation made in the earlier chapters.40 It is understandable, then, that the writer would try to establish the propriety of God's part in Jesus* passion and death before the exposition of the essence of the christology beginning in chap. 8. If there were a special need in the community to argue for the suitability of God's involvement in Jesus' suffering and death, then there is further reason to use npénsiv in 2:10. Because propriety and persuasion are linked in rhetoric, when the composer of He- brews uses this verb he is not only referring to what is seemly and appropriate, but also to what is more effective and persuasive. Since he perceived the perfection of Christ both to be fitting and qualifying for his mediation, making him a better high priest, it is reasonable to assume that his view of the propriety of that event also involved its persuasiveness. From a rhetorical perspective, that should be based on how it discloses the i^Ooç of God and appeal to the nà Ooç of the letter's recipients. A. The Need for Rhetoric in Hebrews Barnabas Lindars's interpretation of Hebrews exploits the power of its rhetorical structure for resolving a critical issue within the community it addresses.41 As a well crafted piece of deliberative rhetoric, Hebrews has a dramatically persuasive effect on its readers. They are recently converted Hellenistic Jews who have lost confidence in the efficacy of the sacrificial death of Christ. Some of their number may even have returned to the syn- agogue of their origin. Faced with this crisis, the leaders of the community called upon an author, known for rhetorical skill, to win back the diffident among them. In Lindars's estimation this author did an exceptional job in shaping a document that succeeded, through the grace and art of its lan- guage, in restoring the confidence of those who had strayed.42 37 Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 82. 38 Ibid., 82; cf. Michel, Hebräer, 41. 39 Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 216. 40 Ibid., 217. 41 "The Rhetorical Structure of Hebrews," 351-78. 42 Ibid., 390.</page><page sequence="10">690 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 54, 1992 At the heart of the controversy is a lack of confidence some community members exhibited about the power of Jesus' atoning death. According to Lindars, they had a crisis of conscience over sin that drove them back to their Jewish roots. If they were not actually offering sacrifice for sins, they were at least expressing "solidarity with the covenant people and the temple at its heart, and so [providing] assurance of the reconciliation with God which they need."43 The author of Hebrews mustered his rhetorical skill to win them back by showing that Jesus' death met all the requirements for atone- ment according to the Jewish law. Atonement requires the ministry of the high priest: Jesus is a high priest. Atone- ment requires the death of the sacrificial victim to release the blood: Jesus died. Atonement requires the sprinkling of blood: Jesus* blood was shed. Atonement requires the entry of the high priest through the veil into the holy of holies: Jesus passed through the veil of his flesh to enter into the presence of God in heaven. The author simply selects details which the readers are certain to respect as central to Jewish understanding of atonement and which can readily be applied to the death of Jesus.44 Lindars's argument is intriguing for the way it demonstrates how the rhetorical structure of the letter persuades its readers to assume the author's position. He has convincingly elucidated a concrete problem in the commu- nity, and has argued well for the author's skill at resolving it. Yet his analysis raises an interesting question. If the point was to show how Jesus' death fulfilled the basic requirements of atonement, why would that alone be suf- ficient to retain the conscience-stricken community members? The argument suggests parity between Jewish atoning sacrifices and the death of Jesus. What is decisive about the latter that would ultimately persuade the readers to return with confidence to the primitive kerygma? The obvious answer is the permanence of Jesus' sacrifice; it does not require repetition.45 Lindars locates the center of the argument at 10:19- 12:29, where the author proves the lasting quality of Jesus' death by con- trasting it with the ritual requirements for the Day of Atonement. Those sacrifices cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper (9:9), but Jesus' sacrifice can (9:14-28). Whereas the writer points to the effects of Christ's death, he does not explain how the sacrifice works. According to Lindars, it is enough to know that, by their effects, Jesus' suffering and death are the means to reconciliation with God.46 43 Ibid., 404. 44 Ibid., 403. 45 Ibid., 395. 46 Lindars sees this kind of a fortiori argument as typifying the writer's rhetorical style, for it need not attend to the strict rules of logic: "It enables a writer to jump over a series of</page><page sequence="11">HEBREWS 2:10 691 Lindars is right that chap. 9 does not explain, despite an extensive comparison of the sacrifices on the Day of Atonement with the death of Jesus, why the writer saw his death as more efficacious than Jewish sacrifice. But there is a clue in 2:10-18, a text which Lindars treats only summarily.47 A frequently overlooked feature of Jesus' death, as the author of Hebrews describes it, is the propriety of God's role in it, something alien to the Greco- Jewish milieu of the community. This propriety adds a qualitative difference to Jesus' sacrifice. Whereas Jesus' death satisfies the requirements of atone- ment according to the Jewish law, the added benefit of his death comes from his relationship to God, whose fidelity is revealed in an action that otherwise would be offensive to Jewish readers. The completeness of Jesus' sacrifice goes beyond the temporal "once for all" character of it.48 The teleology of his death is based on his relationship to both God and humans, which renders a substantially different mediation than that of the Jewish high priest - hence, the stress on the propriety of God's perfecting Jesus through suffering. B. God as Persuasive Speaker The portrayal of God as a speaker is clear in Hebrews, and it is not unreasonable to think that the notion of rhetorical propriety helped the author express the effectiveness of God's speech in Christ. That the function of God's salvific action in Christ is meant to be persuasive, on the analogy of a speech act, is partly reflected in the letter's concern that its recipients listen effectively and appropriate its message. The midrash on Ps 95:7-8 in 4:7, af||ispov èàv xfļ&lt;; (pcovfjç auxoö áKoúat|t8, aicXTjpí&gt;VT|TS xàç KapSíaç ů^uov, for example, exhorts the audience to accept the word spoken.

Al- though neither Xóyoç nor ć&gt;%a is directly predicated of Jesus in Hebrews, the author's perception of him in terms of speech is evident from the opening of the letter: èn' èaxáxou tcdv f||isp(5v toótíov è'á'r]Gzv f||iîv èv uícp (1:2).49 logical steps to reach the desired conclusion without much ado" (ibid., 399). It is precisely this kind of logical vacuum that rhetoric distinctively tries to fill. Therein lies some of its persuasive power. 47 Ibid., 391-92. 48 See Peterson, Hebrews and Perfection, 126-30. 49 Lindars, "The Rhetorical Structure of Hebrews," 387; E.

The contrast between w 1 and 2 suggests that God's speech through the prophets was less complete.51 Attridge, for example, has noted that, as later in the letter, the one atoning sacrifice of Jesus as high priest will be contrasted to the many sacrifices of the old dispensation, so too here the singularity and finality of God's speech in Jesus is contrasted with the multiplicity and diversity of divine speech in the past.52 Thus, the opening argument anticipates the later exposition of Jesus' decisive sacrifice. For a community that may be wavering on the salvific value of Jesus' sacrifice, the need for a persuasive argument is self-evident. What could be more persuasive than appealing to the unique status of the mediator as Son, heir of all things, agent of creation, reflection of God's glory, and stamp of God's character, the one who makes purification for sin and is exalted at the right hand of God (1:2-3)? This shorthand summary of the author's view of the Christ event stresses the unity and solidarity of the Son with the divine and human order. This perceived unity, harmony be- tween the divine and human order, cannot help but inform the author's understanding of the propriety of God's perfecting Jesus through suffering. The ensuing arguments, which try to demonstrate this, function to articulate how appropriate it was for God to be so involved in Jesus' suffering and death. Paul Minear highlighted the aspect of proclamation in Jesus' mediation in his analysis of how the author envisioned it in 2:5-3:6.53 He sees there a triangular conversation among God, Jesus, and humans and posits a creative vision, a christophany, which served as a prelude to the author's exposition of Ps 22:22 and Isa 8:17-18 cited there. The author, he says, envisions Jesus in the midst of the community proclaiming God's name to his brothers and sisters. 50 See Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 37-38; Hughes, Hebrews, 35-38; Michel, Hebräer, 93; Vanhoye, Situation, 55. L. T. Johnson (The Writings of the New Testament: An Interpretation [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1986] 418-19) notes that the message of the letter rests on a sustained argument a minore ad mains, which relies heavily on analogy. Since every analogy requires an element of similarity and an element of dissimilarity, the point of the comparison is to establish something greater, and not merely to highlight a likeness. 51 Recent commentators have taken TcoXo^iepófr; and TioXuxpóncix; as indicators of the fragmentary nature of God's speech through the prophets instead of as hendiadys for different manners of speaking. See M. M. Bourke, "Hebrews," NJBC, 922 ; H. W. Attridge, "Hebrews," HBC, 1260. 52 Attridge ( The Epistle to the Hebrews, 95) claims: "However the multiplicity of God's speech of old is to be conceived, Hebrews' basic affirmation is that such diversity contrasts with the singularity and finality of God's eschatological speech in the Son." See also Hughes, He- brews, 36. 53 "An Early Christian Theopoetic?," Semeia 12 (1978) 201-13.</page><page sequence="13">HEBREWS 2:10 693 Minear's appreciation of the author's perception of reality makes sense. This author's thought-world consists of three important points: God, Christ, and humans. Because Jesus has the status of mediator, God's action in him is revelatory, like speech between a speaker and an audience. That the con- versation is ongoing is evident in chap. 3. At 3:5 the contrasting example of Moses' fidelity points to things that would be spoken later, the final word which is a major theme of this letter.54 The persuasiveness of God's speech in Christ is especially highlighted in the contrast drawn between the Israelites, who heard it from of old, and the believers the letter is addressed to. They are reminded that those to whom the word was previously spoken had not received it because they were not per- suaded by it. The exhortation in 3:7-19 stresses how the letter's recipients should differ from their Jewish forebears on this matter.55 At 4:6 and 1 1 the Israelites' inability to be persuaded (ánsíGsia) is mentioned again, right be- fore the concluding section recalling how God's word is living and active (4:12-13), penetrating the thoughts and intentions of the believers, who now are held to greater accountability (npòç ôv i|^ïv ó Xóyoç).56 While the author may hold the ancient Israelites responsible for their hardness of heart, he seems willing to mitigate their offense.57 As he well knows (see 5:11-14), every speaker faces the problem of persuading some listeners while not convincing others. There is a cloud of witnesses, those who were persuaded, whom the author brings forth as exemplary (chap. 1 1). But the reader also has the sense that the author is more lenient towards those unfaithful Israelites, who were "disobedient" because they did not have the advantage of a more persuasive word. When comparing their Israelite an- cestors to the addressees in 4:2, the author mentions, áXX' ouk dxpéXriasv ó Xòyoq xfjç áicofíç èiceívouç 'ii' auyKeKspaa^évoix; xfj tcíoxei toíç àKoúaaaiv. The reason they did not benefit from the word they received is that they were not united in faith with those who listened, i.e., the recipients of the letter to whom was given a more persuasive word. This notion is similar to what is said in 1 1 :40 about those faithful recipients of the word of old, who could not be perfected apart from the believers.58 Thus, the community members who "today" hear the word have an advantage over the people of the OT who 54 Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 111. 55 Attridge (ibid., 121) notes the important relationship of persuasion and faith in this verse: " 'Disobedience' (áneíOeia) is in fact the failure to be persuaded, a failure to come to 'faith* (tûîotiç).m 56 Ibid., 133, 136: "To him is our account directed."

They also have a greater responsibility. If the faithlessness of the Israelites was based on their inability to be persuaded by what they heard, that of the present generation will not be excused, for their faith is predicated on a response to a word that is better able to persuade (1 1:39-40).59 Despite the various responses of previous generations, God continues faithfully to try to bring humans to salvation.60 Throughout the first seven chapters of the letter, the author portrays God as steadfast in attempting to communicate meaningfully in this regard. These attempts are bound up with God's nature as beginning and end of all things (see 1:1,10; 2:3; 4:1,8-11; 6:12,13-20; 7:21). The motivation, as stated in 6:17, is compatible with the rhetorical enterprise: "to show more convincingly the unchangeable charac- ter of his promise" (ÄSK). And so, what makes God's part in Jesus' suffering both fitting and persuasive is how it discloses the character of God (íjôoç) and appeals to human emotions (rcáOoç) when highlighting the continual divine initiative.61 The development of the argument, between 2:5 and 7:28, for the process of God's perfecting Jesus through suffering will help explain this.62 C. A More Persuasive God- 2:5-18 The author's application of npénsiv to God in 2:10 attends to the dis- closure of the divine fjÔoç, while eliciting rcáOoç from the readers. The God of creation is the God of redemption, i.e., is effectively involved in bringing creation to its destined end. This was not only right for God to do but was, more importantly, appropriate. God's role in Jesus' perfection fits with past attempts at bringing salvation but also goes beyond them. The effects of Christ's perfection for all of creation present a more persuasive attempt on God's part. Thus the propriety of God's role in Jesus' perfection is twofold: it shows who God is and illustrates why God's final and most complete attempt should be convincing. The first mention of Christ's perfection through suffering in 2:10 is cen- tral to the whole argument of 2:5-18.63 The yáp in v 10 links it with what 59 Käsemann, The Wandering People, 57; Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 351-52. G. A. Kennedy ( New Testament Interpretation through Rhetorical Criticism [Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina, 1984] 158-59) identifies the rhetorical goal of the Bible as pur- poseful speech between God and humans, or at least between biblical writers and their readers. The Bible achieves its goal by its attention to logical, ethical, and emotional concerns, the way rhetoric does. 60 Käsemann ( The Wandering People, 64) understands this continuity under the rubric of "divine witness which continually creates new objects for its concretization." 61 See Peterson, Hebrews and Perfection, 55. 62 Ibid., 49-125. 63 See Hughes, Hebrews, 97-98. Peterson ( Hebrews and Perfection, 49) has noted the centrality of this verse and also that 2:5-18 gathers many of the themes that will concern the author throughout the rest of the letter.</page><page sequence="15">HEBREWS 2:10 695 precedes, showing that the propriety stems, in part, from the integration of Christ's perfection with the circumstances which occasioned it: in bringing many to glory. God's description as 81' öv xà rcávxa Kai 8i' oö xà návxa, the origin and end of all things, and the argument of the previous verses (w 5-9), proposing the fulfillment of the human in Christ, make a close link between creation and redemption.64 This recalls the opening of the letter, where a similar relative clause, 8i' oö Kai ēnoirļasv xoúç alawaç (1:2), discloses Christ's role in creation, while anticipating his part in redemption.65 In order for salvation, the final completion of humans and their proximity to God, to be effective, God chose to perfect Christ, the representative human, through suffering.66 Because the author understands the Son to be the reflection of God's glory carrying the stamp of the divine nature (1:3), the involvement of God in the Son's perfection has revelatory value.67 The application of Psalm 8 to Jesus in 2:9 helps explain how he com- pletes the divine plan in this regard: the glory that God promised to humans reaches its fulfillment in him.68 When the psalm inquires what business God has with humans, it anticipates the mention of divine involvement in w 9 and 10. There the incarnation demonstrates the true relationship between God and humans: in Christ, the link between creation and redemption is ex- pressed, and the process of perfection effected in him demonstrates the sig- nificance of the link. As the representative human, Jesus is the forerunner (6:20) of human destiny in relation to God.69 That the perfection mentioned in v 10 rendered Jesus a more appropriate mediator in this regard is expected in the argument between w 5 and 9.

It may not be possible to see auxco xa návxa ônoxexaynéva (v 8), but what can be seen is what the psalm foretold about process of glorification (v 7), as that was accomplished for all humans in Jesus. For the time being, the readers must be content with this manifestation of God's purpose, all the while they are being asked to ponder who God is and what God has done in Jesus on their behalf. In answer to the question raised in the psalm, this is how God is with humans, remembers and cares for them, by bringing them to their destiny as was promised in the various ways God spoke of old (1:1). And this was achieved in the perfection of the ápxriyòç xfjç a&lt;oxr|piaę. The writer sees a desire for persuasion too, as the remainder of the argument addresses the divine intention to act more decisively in Jesus. Through the grace of God, Jesus accomplished something the human high priest did not do. His death involves God in human suffering, while con- vincingly demonstrating the superiority of his sacrifice. Three things estab- lish him as better than the high priest in this regard. First, he shares solidarity with humans, which derives from a common origin (2:11-13). Second, the only way to overcome the power of death effectively and deliver humans from it was to experience it himself (2:14-16). Third, he could qualify in this way as a merciful and faithful high priest, who knows the struggle of the people whose sins he expiates (2:17-18).74 The stress on Jesus as the fulfillment of human destiny, and the scrip- tural arguments to support it ground the unique character of his mediation. He is a better representative because of his solidarity both with the human and the divine. The message expressed in Christ is, therefore, more persua- sive, because it discloses the fjGoç of the speaker and elicits náôoç from the audience in a way God's previous speech seemed not to.75 The success, then, 71 Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 75. 72 Commentators have labored over the structure of this verse and the placement of the final clause. According to Michel {Hebräer, 139) it seems out of sequence since there has already been mention of his crowning. Yet if the structure of v 9 is designed to show how Jesus* suffering fulfills Psalm 8, then "crowned with glory and honor" relates more to what precedes it than to what follows (Vanhoye, Situation, 295). Attridge (The Epistle to the Hebrews, 76) and Peterson ( Hebrews and Perfection, 55) believe that the last clause modifies the whole previous part of the verse, and not just what immediately precedes it. 73 Hughes, Hebrews, 92; Vanhoye, Situation, 299-300. 74 Peterson, Hebrews and Perfection, 55. 75 Ibid., 129.</page><page sequence="17">HEBREWS 2:10 697 of what God achieved in Christ, rendering him a more effective mediator, is essential to the author's understanding of propriety in this text. D. A More Persuasive Mediator - 4:14-5:10 The example of Jesus' priesthood in 4:14-5:10 is parenetic, urging the readers: Kpaxtojisv xfjç ó|ioXoyíaç.76 For this to succeed there must be an appeal to what makes his priestly work more convincing. The appeal is based on the surety of God's promise manifest in Jesus and the superiority of his sacrifice to those of former high priests. Jesus' priesthood is firmly estab- lished as he was appointed by God (5:5,10). Not only does divine authority stand behind Jesus' qualification to be a high priest. Scripture, too, identifies him as Son. The echo of the opening verses of chap. 1 is inescapable here. Thus, the writer stresses the superiority of Jesus' mediation when claim- ing he is not only priest but also Son, ëxovxsç oöv àpxiepéa ^léyav . . . Irļaouv tòv uíòv xoõ OeoO (4:14). The comparison with the old high priests emphasizes the greater value of his mediation, both from the human and divine sides. But it is not only the exercise of the office that is being com- pared, as the appropriateness of the individuals serving in that role is also being evaluated. Propriety is presupposed as a criterion for persuasiveness. Jesus, however similar to the high priest in humanity and function, does not merely deal gently with fellow humans; he sympathizes with them be- cause he knows their trials (4:15). This makes him quite different from a human priest. True, the human high priest is qualified to offer sacrifices for sin because he has sinned. But his weakness only enables him to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward (5:2). And he does this exclusively from the human side, having been drawn from the ranks of humanity. The contrast of aunnaGfjaai (4:15) and nsxpiorcaOsïv (5:2) suggests that Jesus' mediation is substantially better from the human side. Zu|inaOf|oai connotes a close re- lationship between Jesus and humans, whereas iiexpioraOew (to measure one's anger) suggests distance and aloofness on the part of the human high priest.77 Because Jesus is not only priest but also Son, there is a better me- diation from the divine side. Being perfected as Son, he becomes "the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him" (5:9), as earlier he was "the pioneer of salvation" (2:10). So there is a closeness from God's side that the human high priest could not guarantee. The priesthood of the old dispensation was fitting for two reasons: first, the weakness of the priest enabled him to deal gently with (measure his anger against) the ignorant and the wayward (5:2-3); second, the priest was 76 Ibid., 75-81. 77 E.

Contrasted with that, Jesus' priesthood is more appropriate still: first, because, from his incarnation he is able to sympathize with humans; second, because as Son and high priest his suffering rendered him the "source of eternal salvation for all who obey him" (5:9). While there is similarity between the two, the author makes clear that Jesus' priesthood is superior. He sympathizes with the hu- man condition, being closer to it than the priests of old. But as Son he is also closer to God and is the true link between God and humans.78 Remarkable in all this is the inclusion of the graphic description of Jesus' suffering in 5:7. The author deemed this appropriate for God's involvement, when perfecting him. The prayers and supplications, accompanied by loud cries and tears, were made to the one who could save him from death. These God heard.79 Even though he was Son, intimately linked with God, he was made to endure that suffering, which was not merely incidental to his priest- hood but was constitutive of it.80 What stronger appeal to audience náôoç can be made than this vivid description of Jesus' share in the human condition? Within the context of the comparison of his priesthood with that of the former high priests, the per- suasiveness of God's action in Christ grows. The listeners can identify more easily with the one who knows suffering as they do. Just as it was fitting, then, for God to perfect Christ through suffering, in bringing others to salvation in 2: 10, so also is it proper for God to teach him obedience through suffering so that he might become the source of salvation for all who obey (5:9).81 Both expressions articulate a solidarity between the human and the divine which could only be achieved by Jesus. 78 On the relationship of Jesus' priesthood and sonship, see Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 137-54, esp. pp. 146-47; A. Vanhoye, Our Priest is Christ: The Doctrine of the Epistle to the Hebrews (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1977) 23-39; C. Spicq, L'Epîtreaux Hébreux (SB; Paris: Gabalda, 1977) 98-100. 79 Despite the passive, eloaicoóeiv means more than simply to hear. Rather it means to hear effectively and act on what is heard. Frequently in the LXX, it signals God's response to prayers or characterizes an earnest supplication (see G. Kittell, TDNT, 1. 221-22). In Deut 30:10, 20 it marks the response one should make to God. An interesting use occurs in Ps 22:24 (21:25), Kai èv T$ KEKpayévai he n pòç aùxòv elaf|Kouoév ^oo, the same psalm quoted in 2:12. In the psalm the supplicant will proclaim God's name to his brethren and praise God in the midst of the congregation, and the congregation is exhorted to do likewise, because (òxt) God did not despise, abhor, or hide his face from him, but heard him when he cried out. This argues for a fuller sense of eioaicoóeiv, one which renders God more sympathetic to human suffering. The sense of eloaicoúeiv here is perhaps closer to that of Exod 2:24-25 and 22:27. 80 Spicq, LEpître aux Hébreux, 2. 117; Peterson, Hebrews and Perfection, 95. 81 Michel ( Hebräer ; 229) notes the formal similarity between aïxioç ocûtripiaç ataviou in 5:9 and ápx^YÒÇ aû)ir)piaç in 2:10.</page><page sequence="19">HEBREWS 2:10 699 E. A More Persuasive Mediation - 7.š20-28 Important themes from previous chapters are recapitulated in these last verses of chap. 7, which can be easily divided into two segments. The first segment (7:20-23) recalls the fidelity of God under the metaphor of the oath, already mentioned at 6:13. Remembering the oath functions in two ways: it discloses again a feature of the divine i^ôoç, the irrevocable nature of God's word, and it grounds the completeness of Jesus' priesthood, discussed in the remaining verses.82 The oath establishing the confirmation of Jesus' status as eternal high priest marks the final attempt of God to bring salvation to humans. It is not just a formality, but goes to the heart of Jesus' priesthood.83 Here is a sign of the fact that God has not gone back on the promises of old; the divine mind did not change, as the citation from Ps 110:4 recalls. When viewed together with what was said in 6: 17-18, the desire for persuasiveness on God's part emerges. Within the context of Jesus' perfection in these chapters, it relates to the propriety of God's role in that perfection. The recurrence of npénsiv in 7:26 supports this interpretation. For the kind of priest Jesus is (toioutoç ápxiepsúç) encompasses more than the adjectives of that verse merely state. In the process of his perfection, there is a revelation of the God who is instrumental in the salvation of humans. God's i*ļ0o&lt;; is uncovered in this very process and is shown to be one which features constancy, fidelity, veracity, and determination to make a persuasive case for humans to appropriate. Here is a God who "desired to show more convinc- ingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose . . ." (6:17). The remaining verses drive that point home by demonstrating Jesus' priesthood in terms that relate it to the human situation. Attridge has noted the ambiguity of etç xò navxsXèç in v 25, which may be construed modally to mean "completely," or temporally as a synonym for návTOie, "for all time."84 So the author seems not to be interested simply in the temporal side of the question. Both senses contribute to the meaning of propriety in v 26. The complete and eternal mediation joins the human and divine spheres and makes possible a harmony between God and humans. Again the comparison between the old priests and the Son is noted to heighten the appeal of Jesus' mediation. Humans are genuinely able to ap- preciate Jesus' priesthood because of the fullness of his intercession, which uniquely joins them to God. This renders his atonement more persuasive than what the old priesthood could accomplish. 82 Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 206-7. 83 Ibid., 207. 84 Ibid., 210. Attridge also mentions the writer's exploitation of ambiguity at 2:5-9; 2:10- 18; and 3:1-6. In n. 61 he cites authors who believe both senses are present in the expression.</page><page sequence="20">700 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 54, 1992 At 7:26, the author proclaims Jesus an appropriate high priest for hu- mans. The use of npéneiv differs from its use in 2:10. There propriety was mentioned in relation to God; here it focuses on what was appropriate for humans in Jesus' perfection through suffering.85 The untypical use of npénsiv is intriguing. Unlike the earlier use, it is not impersonal; the subject is xoioC- Toç ápxiepeúç.86 The emphasis lies not on the speaker's style but rather on the suitability of what was said for the listeners. Audience reception is the focus, perhaps a wondering about how the listeners will respond. Although the writer declares this high priest fit for the readers, the placement of this verse suggests he is seeking confirmation for the arguments developed from 2:5. While affirming it, he wants to know if the audience agrees with his assessment of the suitability of God's involvement in Jesus' suffering and death, if what he understood to be the disclosure of the divine f10oç and the appeal to audience náOoç has been effective. The mention of propriety here asks the audience to assess for themselves the previous demonstration of divine propriety in the perfection of Jesus. He seeks this assessment as an assurance that the audience is with him before beginning the next phase of the argument in 8:1. When making this transition, the writer also summarizes his main points. Jesus as high priest is an appropriate expression of the divine inten- tion because of how he fits the needs of humans in that role. Therefore, he is capable of eliciting the desired emotional response from the audience, evidence of an attempt at persuasiveness. It is not accidental, then, that in a kind of inclusio the use of rcpénsiv in 7:26 hearkens back to 2:10, for the discussion since the early part of the letter has been directed towards what is more appealing about his priesthood. God's role in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus was fitting for the way it proclaimed the divine fjôoç and appealed to human náOoç. On this basis confidence in a better mediation can be secured. III. Conclusion The value of interpreting rcpénsiv in Hebrews from the perspective of rhetoric lies in a fuller appreciation of the "conversation" between God and Peterson ( Hebrews and Perfection, 115-16) stresses how the toioõtoç of 7:26 helps bridge the description of Christ as high priest in v 25 and the discussion of his priesthood in w 27-28. This makes the identification of Jesus with humans more complete, in his estimation, enhancing its propriety. See also Michel, Hebräer, 278-86, and Attridge, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 212-13. The verse should be translated: "Such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, sepa- rated from sinners, exalted above the heavens was fit for us." Cf. NEB and REB. Still some translators treat is as though it were impersonal by supplying an infinitive "to have** which virtually renders xoioOxoç ápxiepeúç its subject. Hence the usual translation "It was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens (RSV).

That exchange of communication, on the analogy of a well-crafted speech, attends to the disclosure of God's i'0oç while addressing the auditors' náôoç, achieving the function of rhetorical propriety. Seeing npénsiv this way ties the use of the verb in 2:10 more closely to its use in 7:26 and underscores the element of persuasion that is at the heart of this writer's task. The rhetorical concept of propriety speaks to God's constant efforts at communicating effectively with humans, which culminate in the suffering and death of Jesus. This is im- portant to the author's purpose because he has been given the task of win- ning back some diffident community members who questioned the ultimate value of Jesus' sacrificial death. The author's project, facilitated by extraor- dinary rhetorical skill, shows how his art partly informed his theology: how in trying to make a persuasive argument for the superiority of Jesus' medi- ation between the divine and the human, he has understood God to have done that first.</page></plain_text>
