WASTIAU. 2001 EXITCONGOMUSEUM A Century of Art with/without Papers Musee Royal de l'Afriqlue Centrale Tervuren, Belgium Nozvember 24, 2000- Junte 24, 2001 Reviewed by Marie-Therese Brincard The fame of the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale resides in its vast holdings of approx- imately 160,000 objects from central Africa, of which only about 1,600 are on display, and in its 90,000 archival photographs. The extent of this fame, however, is primarily confined to scholars, anthropologists, ethnologists, art his- torians, collectors, and dealers in African art who go to the museum to view some of the greatest Congo artworks, to pursue research in the reserve collections, and to make use of the extraordinary wealth of documents. The Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale was built to "promote" the Belgian colony, a mandate that continued until the Belgian Congo's independence. Ambitious in its un- dertaking, the provocative and thoughtful 76 exhibition "ExitCongoMuseum: A Century of Art with/without Papers" challenged the spe- cialist and engaged the general public by shedding new light on the 125 pieces consid- ered to be the masterpieces of the Tervuren collection. It aimed not only to provide for the first time a critical reflection on the history of these holdings but to start an open-ended debate on the museum's role in the future, and consequently on what kind of museology should replace the colonial presentation of the permanent collection. The dramatic opening suggested these intentions: the first object en- countered was an anthropomorphic Ngata coffin, presented diagonally within a large rectangular case. It acted as a metaphor for entombment, interpretable both as a reference to the depletion of material culture from the African continent and as an expression of the curator's view of a museum stagnating in its mission and old-fashioned museology. The title of the exhibition provided the basis for its organization. The first section, "Exit Congo" (Fig. 1), traced the ways in which these pieces left central Africa during the colo- nial period through military and ethnographic campaigns, trade, missionaries, collectors, and museum curators. The second, "Ex-Congo- Museum-'Congoworld,'" examined the vari- ous new functions or "lives" of the objects once they entered the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Cen- trale (Fig. 2). The exhibition's curator, Boris Wastiau, adjunct curator in the museum's de- partment of ethnography, explains in the accompanying catalogue that "initially the objects were used as colonial propaganda, later became mediators in the formation of a popu- lar image of the Congo and its inhabitants," and then were used to illustrate "Primitivism," "authenticity," and style (ExitCongoMuseum, p. 37). He underlines the flaws in each of these functions, flaws which derive from colonial domination and Eurocentricism. The latter is reflected, for example, in "the rejection of cultural hybridisation and transformation," developments that occur in the making of objects over the course of time. This historical point of view, however, has already begun to be addressed in both scholarship and exhibi- tions, precisely so that "the casting of objects in molds that suggest static identities"-a pre- vailing approach in the past-is indeed giving way to an understanding of the "fluid nature of regional interaction and exchange sys- tems."1 The third and final section, "Exit Museum, The Contact Zone," opened a debate that aims to establish an interaction between african arts * winter 2001 . . . . %.w . %. . ., . .

How were these concepts articulated visu- ally? Almost all of the 125 objects presented in the first two sections, ingeniously displayed in red wedge-shaped wooden modules (diag- onally bisected cubes) two meters tall, illus- trated and connected subthemes of the three major section themes. These connections, however, were not easy to understand except in the case of the subthemes that related directly to the histories of the various owners of these works-"Soldiers and Trophies," "Missionaries and Fetishes," "Administrators and Borders." Other secondary themes, such as "Arbiters of Authenticity" and "Preservers of the Primitive," required the viewer to read the extensive documentation accompanying the objects in order to even understand the reason for the grouping. The last section pre- sented a series of commissioned pieces by contemporary artists that spilled over into the museum's permanent galleries. Each module in the first two sections dis- played objects below eye level-often one had to bend to see them-as crowded, poorly lit ensembles. In some instances, such as the cluster of works relating to the theme of "col- lector," the presentation prompted the visitor to disregard the object and only read the pan- els and labels or look at the slides projected on the side walls alongside maps and drawings. Wastiau clearly stated his intent about the role of the works in this exhibition, writing in the catalogue that the show did not "concentrate on the objects' 'universal' aesthetic qualities, but on their 'moving' history, their displace- ments, the actual and intangible borders they [had] crossed and the social and cultural interactions in which they [had] played a part, frequently the role of mediator" (p. 9). One the art and the ideological content of the exhi- bition. This provocative presentation certainly made its point, in the second section, particu- larly in connection with the theme of the anonymity of the African artist, but what was the rationale for its presence in the first? The extensive historical documentation took the form of written texts, 18 maps and drawings, and 148 slides of archival photos. These slides, projected on the walls in the- matic groups of ten to sixteen, visually rein- forced the stories of the objects' complex journeys. The graphic beauty of many of the historical documents added an unexpected aesthetic dimension to the otherwise straight- forward display. Three striking examples come to mind. At the entrance one saw a pho- tograph of the port of Antwerp, taken at the turn of the last century; the image, depicting boats leaving for the Congo, was enlarged to a monumental scale and projected onto a floating white cloth that sent visitors off on their own exhibition journey. Another effec- tive document was the delicate and intricate cross-section drawing (1907) by the muse- um's architect, Charles Giraud, illustrating the arrangement of the galleries with the panoply of weapons. Finally, a monumental Congo map (1928) painted on canvas by Allard L'Olivier-a commission for the rail- must ask, however, whether it was necessary to diminish the objects in making these points.

This map symbol- ically takes up the theme illustrated in the photograph opening the exhibition by visu- ally reinforcing the theme of the voyage, the movement and displacement of human beings and objects. Whereas the ten modules in the first two sections provided visual coherence, the dis- play in the final section-of contemporary works contrasting in scale, media, and con- cept-challenged the visitor (Figs. 2, 3). The curator of this final section, the Congolese artist Toma Muteba Luntumbue, invited seven other artists to work with him: Edith Dekyndt, Luc Tuymans, Johan Muyle, and Philip Aguirre y Otegui of Belgium; David Hammons of the United States; Audry Liseron- Monfils of Guadeloupe; and Barthelemy Toguo of Cameroon. All their pieces except for David Hammons's were commissioned for this display. To pursue the investigation of the museum's possible new role, contemporary works were scattered throughout the perma- nent galleries. Could one view this section as a rupture with the historical past? As a new interpreta- tion of this past? As a stimulus to each visitor to imagine new museological orientations for the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale? Indeed, the presence of these contemporary works was no- necessarily conceived to arouse aesthetic feeling but rather to allow various audiences and communities to bring to the museum "a wide range of historical experiences and political agendas."2 As noted in the website for this exhibition, in this way "unlimited and contradictory points of view" were offered to the visitor so that the museum became a "space for critical expression." I was drawn to two contemporary works: Luntumbue's Le Musee de Gilberte, an experi- ment in practical criticism,3 and David Ham- mons's breathtaking Chasing the Blue Train. Both pieces in their own ways echoed issues presented in the first two sections, as they addressed indifference and the displacement of peoples and raw materials. If "ExitCongoMuseum" intended to pre- sent many hidden stories of Tervuren's 125 masterpieces in a provocative deconstruction- ist discourse in which the object was ap- proached from a sociological and economic point of view, it definitely succeeded. It also succeeded in thwarting some of the visitor's expectations by occluding the "traditional" Congo object as a formal sculptural work and by including provocative contemporary pieces in order to open up the debate on the muse- um's new orientation. The exhibition did break old molds, and its curator can be recog- nized for challenging conventions. Success- fully critical, did "ExitCongoMuseum" offer constructive alternatives? Did its discourse of "otherness," new to the Musee Royal de l'Af- rique Centrale, add to the already fertile post- colonialist interrogations?

FODE CAMARA Many Colors, Much Meaning Contemporary African Art Gallery New York, New York April 18-October 15, 2001 Reviewed by Joanna Grabski Art enthusiasts will certainly remember Sen- egalese artist Fode Camara's stunning paint- ings from such exhibitions as "Africa Explores" and "Revolution Franqaise sous les Tropiques" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. While Camara has shown widely in Europe and Africa since that time, this exhibition at New York's Con- temporary African Art Gallery marked his first solo show at an American venue. Gallery owner Bill Karg, a long-time admirer of Camara's work, selected ten recent acrylic-on- canvas pieces both for their compelling beauty and the set of social issues they address. Even with the gallery's relatively modest space, the paintings were adequately lit and thoughtfully arranged according to theme, color, and composition. Without a doubt, the colorful virtuoso painting for which Camara is so well known has become increasingly robust, expressive, and intense in the last decade. The artist's expertise in painting, interior design, and dec- oration synthesizes in the exhibited pieces. Compared with his earlier work, these recent canvases are more intensive explorations of the formal elements of painting and interior design, especially space, color, and volume. While his works are tightly composed with strong, vertical axes, his compositions chal- lenge conventional spatial schemes. Camara engages the canvas as a particular kind of space in which background and foreground are deconstructed and rearticulated as con- verging planes, ambiguous tracts, and swirling bands of bold color. Indeed, as the artist him- self has explained, his practice is concerned with "the act of doing and exploring the pos- sibilities of technique" (taped interview with the author, June 4, 1999). Camara rarely paints on an easel, preferring instead to move his canvas to the floor, where he interacts with it, taking into account and reacting to each pre- ceding gesture in the development of his composition. In this, the canvas is both the support for representation and a space to explore the performative aspects of painting.

HASSAN &amp; OGUIBE: Notes, from page 75 [This article was accepted for publication in September 2001.] 1. The Venice Biennale was initiated at a time when most African 96 countries were under European colonial rule. Since the 1960s, the acquisition of a pavilion in Venice has become too expensive for most African countries to pursue. Egypt is an exception because of the cose relations between the Egyptian monarchy and Italy prior to the revolution led by Jamal Abdul Nasser in 1953, espe- cially during the reign of King Fouad and King Farouk, who died in exile in Rome. Nasser's regime paid attention to the importance of culture in the interational arena and continued its support for Egyptian representation Venice through its Department of Culture, a policy upheld by the regimes of Sadat and Mubarak. 2. The Forum presently includes among its members: El Anatsui, Ghanaian artist and professor at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka; Ibrahim El Salahi, Sudanese artist; Koyo Kouoh, inde- pendent art consultant and cultural activist, Goree Institute, Senegal; Marilyn Martin, Director of the South African National Gallery; Tumelo Mosaka, South African curator; Florence Alexis, Director of Visual Arts, Afrique en Creations in Paris; Obiora Udechukwu, Nigerian artist and Distinguished Professor at St. Lawrence University, Canton; Okwui Enwezor, Nigerian art critic, curator, and Director of Documenta XI; Gilane Tawadros, Director of the Institute for International Visual Art, London; as well as the present authors. 3. In his One and Three Chairs (1965), American artist Joseph Kosuth combined many of these elements, integrating a "real chair" in the manner of Duchamp's readymades, and employing text and language through which the work was made to reflect not only on the question of the nature and meaning of art but also on the indeterminacy of the "real" within its own components. 4. In this regard the recent anthology edited by Alexander Alberro and Blake Stimson (1999) provides a glimpse of these diverse positions. 5.

In the early 1970s, several students at Khartoum's College of Fine and Applied Art established "Cultural Caravans," which traveled to rural areas and poor neighborhoods bringing art exhibitions, mobile cinema, and theatrical performance to the "people." In 1988 at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, an out- door exhibition was staged on the main thoroughfare of the uni- versity, but was ultimately vandalized (see Oguibe &amp; Odu 1988). 8. Authentic/Ex-Centric includes twelve essays by prominent authors, eight of which were commissioned specifically for the book. They offer a fresh look at conceptualism from an African standpoint, and at issues of cross-cultural and transnational aes- thetics. All the essays emphasize the importance of examining the reciprocal traffic of influences between Africa and the rest of the world. References cited Alberro, Alexander. 1999.
