Frier and Marius Locke Faculty of Physical Education and Health, University of Toronto, 55 Harbord Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2W6, Canada Abstract Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are molecular chaperones that aid in protein synthesis and trafficking and have been shown to protect cells/tissues from various protein damaging stressors. To determine the extent to which a single heat stress and the concurrent accumulation of Hsps influences the early events of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, Sprague-Dawley rats were heat stressed (42°C, 15 minutes) 24 hours prior to overloading 1 plantaris muscle by surgical removal of the gastrocnemius muscle. The contralateral plantaris muscles served as controls. Heat-stressed and/or overloaded plantaris muscles were assessed for muscle mass, total muscle protein, muscle protein concentration, Type I myosin heavy chain (Type I MHC) content, as well as Hsp72 and Hsp25 content over the course of 7 days following removal of the gastrocnemius muscle. As expected, in non-heat-stressed animals, muscle mass, total muscle protein and MHC I content were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) following overload. In addition, Hsp25 and Hsp72 increased significantly after 2 and 3 days of overload, respectively. A prior heat stress-elevated Hsp25 content to levels similar to those measured following overload alone, but heat stress-induced Hsp72 content was increased significantly greater than was elicited by overload alone. Moreover, overloaded muscles from animals that experienced a prior heat stress showed a lower muscle mass increase at 5 and 7 days; a reduced total muscle protein elevation at 3, 5, and 7 days; reduced protein concentration; and a diminished Type I MHC content accumulation at 3, 5, and 7 days relative to non- heat-stressed animals. These data suggest that a prior heat stress and/or the consequent accumulation of Hsps may inhibit increases in muscle mass, total muscle protein content, and Type I MHC in muscles undergoing hypertrophy. INTRODUCTION Cells respond to protein damaging stressors by initiating a response termed the "heat shock" or "stress" response, which involves the rapid and transient increase in a spe- cific set of proteins known as heat shock proteins (Hsps). Since the cellular content of Hsps is elevated during and following stressful conditions, Hsps may facilitate the ability of cells/tissues to restore homeostasis and hence allow a successful adaptation to the stressor. Indeed, nu- merous studies have shown cells with elevated Hsp levels to be resistant against potentially lethal stressors (Kar- mazyn et al 1990, Li et al 1991, Currie et al 1993). For example, heat stress appears to preserve muscle activity and also increases action potential duration, even during normally lethal temperatures (Wu et al 2001). In addition to allowing cells to survive extreme physical and/or bio- chemical stressors, such as that faced by skeletal muscles Correspondence to: Marius Locke, Tel: 416 978 7055; Fax: 416 946 5310; E-mail: marius.lockeQutoronto.ca.

When skeletal muscle is forced to continually contract against a load greater than it is normally accustomed (an overload), the muscle adapts by undergoing hypertrophy (an increase in structural and contractile protein content) as well as by altering myosin heavy chain (MHC) ex- pression to allow for a more energetically favorable con- traction. A work-induced hypertrophy model, employing the removal of the synergists involved in plantar flexion (synergistic ablation) of the rat hindlimb, is well estab- lished; previous studies have documented the biochemi- cal and anthropomorphic changes to the rat plantaris muscle following ablation-induced overload (Noble et al 1983, Locke et al 1994, Plyley et al 1998, Macpherson et al 1999). In particular, these studies consistently reported increased Type I myosin heavy chain (Type I MHC) con- tent in chronically overloaded rat plantaris muscles. Pre- vious studies have also demonstrated that a sham-oper- ated contralateral control limb does not demonstrate hy- 132</page><page sequence="2">Heat stress and hypertrophy 133 pertrophy or alter its protein expression following syn- ergistic ablation (Thomson and Gordon 2005, Sun et al 2006), indicating that the control limb is not favored and experiences normal loading following the surgical pro- cedure. Furthermore, the effect of overload on hypertro- phy is similar when either a unilateral or a bilateral syn- ergistic ablation model is employed (Soltow et al 2006). The hypertrophic process has been suggested to be preceded by muscle-damaging stress (Bischoff 1994), in- dicating that overload may be considered stressful and may initiate the stress response. Given that Hsps act as molecular chaperones that facilitate various aspects of protein synthesis and function, muscles may elevate Hsp content during functional overload in order to adapt to the imposed stress, thereby facilitating hypertrophy. However, the effect of functional overload on the bio- chemical and anthropomorphic changes in a cellular en- vironment with pre-elevated levels of Hsps has not been examined. Because cells with an elevated Hsp content via a single bout of heat stress demonstrate greater resilience to the deleterious effects of subsequent and varied stress- ors, the cellular response to the stress of overload may also be altered following a single heat stress. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to delineate the rela- tionship between the expression of Hsps and the hyper- trophic response to an imposed functional overload in the rat plantaris muscle. It was hypothesized that elevating Hsp content within the plantaris muscle via a single heat stress, prior to subjecting the plantaris muscle to overload by surgical removal of synergistic muscles, would ame- liorate any acute stress effects and thus lead to greater hypertrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study used a total of 50 male Sprague-Daw- ley rats ( 350 g). All animals were maintained on a 12- hour light-dark cycle at 20 + 1°C, with an ambient rela- tive humidity of 50%. Food and water were provided ad libitum. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Toronto. Animals received either a heat stress prior to overload (OL+HS+, n = 25) or no heat stress (OL+HS-; n = 25) prior to overload. In both groups, the contralateral plan- taris muscles served as controls. sion into the skin from the popliteal fossa to the Achilles' tendon on the midline of the lower leg. Medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle were separated and freed from the plantaris muscle using a blunt probe. Both heads were transected, and the gastrocnemius muscle was removed, carefully avoiding disruption to nerve and blood supply at the proximal end. The skin was sutured with 7-8 stitches of sterile 3.0 silk, and a postoperative analgesic (buprenorphine HCL) was administered (0.1 ml/100 g body wt). All procedures were performed un- der sterile conditions. After a selected number of days (1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days; n = 50), the animals were again anes- thetized with isoflurane (2-5% with 1 L O2/min), and the plantaris muscles from the overloaded and contralateral limbs (OL+ and OL-, respectively) were removed. A to- tal of 25 animals were subjected to only overload (OL+HS-). Another 25 animals were treated with a sin- gle, whole-body heat stress (see below) 24 hours prior to undergoing removal of the gastrocnemius muscle in one leg (OL + HS + ). Following synergistic ablation and recov- ery of consciousness, animals were returned to the ani- mal care facility to resume normal comportment. Plan- taris muscles were removed and weighed (following des- ignated experimental incubation periods for each group) while under isoflurane anesthetic (2-5% with 1 L °2/ min) and subsequently euthanized by cardiac excision. Whole-animal heat stress Twenty-five animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2-5% with 1 L O2/min) and received a subcutaneous injection of saline solution (5 ml) to minimize dehydra- tion. Animals were placed on a covered heating pad set at 55°C until core temperature reached 42°C. The heating pad temperature was reduced to 25°C, and core tem- perature was maintained at 42°C for 15 minutes. Rectal temperature was measured before and during the heat stress using a lubricated TSD 102CA Thermistor placed 4 cm into the rectum. The Thermistor was connected to a Biopac data acquisition system (Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Following heat stress, another saline injection (5 ml) was administered; the animals were moved to a recovery cage and provided water ad libitum and appeared to walk normally. Muscle protein concentration and content Muscle portions of 50 mg (cross sections from the mid belly) were homogenized in 20x volume of 600 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris pH 7.5, and protein concentration was determined by the method described by Lowry et al (1951) using BSA as a standard. Total protein content was determined to reveal the extent to which overload in- duced increased muscle mass was represented by in- Cell Stress &amp; Chaperones (2007) 12 (2), 132-141 Hypertrophy Fifty animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2-5% with 1 L 02/min). Hair on the left hindlimb was removed by shaving. The gastrocnemius muscle was surgically re- moved using the procedure described by Ianuzzo and Chen (1979).

Briefly, the weight of the tissue sample used for homogenization (-50 mg) was added to the volume of homogenization buffer to obtain a total vol- ume (ml). The volume was multiplied by the protein con- centration to obtain the total amount of protein (pg) with- in the homogenized muscle portion. This value was di- vided by the mass of the homogenized muscle portion (mg) to yield a protein-to-mass ratio ([ig/mg wet wt). The ratio was then multiplied by the total mass of the entire plantaris muscle to obtain total protein content. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was prepared according to the meth- od described by Laemmli (1970), except that the separat- ing gel (0.15 x 4.5 x 8 cm) consisted of a 5-15% poly- acrylamide gradient. Prestained standards were used as markers (catalog 161-0324, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Samples were then electrophoresed using a Bio- Rad Power Pac 1000 (Bio-Rad) at 55 V for --30 minutes followed by 120 V for -1 hour or until the dye arrived at the bottom of the separating gel. Following electrophoretic separation, gels were equili- brated in Transfer Buffer solution (1x running buffer with 20% methanol [pH 8.3]) for 10 minutes. Following equilibration, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.22-jm pore size, Bio-Rad) as described by Towbin et al (1979) using the Bio-Rad mini-protean II gel transfer system at a voltage of 55 V for 3 hours. The trans- fer buffer was cooled by 2 changes of ice each hour. Fol- lowing protein transfer, nitrocellulose paper was blocked in Blotto (5% nonfat skim milk powder in Tris Buffer Sa- line (TBS: 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5) for 1 hour to overnight. Nitrocellulose membranes were rinsed in 2 washes of TTBS (TBS plus 0.05% Tween-20) followed by incubation with a polyclonal antibody specific for Hsp25 (SPA-801, StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), inducible Hsp70 (Hsp72; SPA-812, StressGen), or a monoclonal antibody specific for anti-skeletal myosin Type I (slow) (M8421 Sigma, Mississauga, Ontario, Can- ada) diluted 1:2000 in TTBS with 2% Blotto (Locke et al 1995). Recombinant Hsp72 (SPP-758, StressGen), recom- binant Hsp25 (SPP-710, StressGen), and control plantaris homogenate were run on each gel to allow standardizing of band intensities positive for Hsp72, Hsp25, and Type I MHC, respectively. Immunoblots were visualized by re- acting an AP-conjugated secondary antibody with a BCIP/NBT solution. Immunoblots were scanned using an Agfa Arcus II scanner, and quantification of bands from the immunoblots was performed using Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT, USA). Hsp25, Hsp72, and Type I MHC content were determined by analyzing the intensities of bands on Western blots. Standard curves were construct- ed to assess linearity. Type I MHC protein quantification Band intensities obtained via Western blotting are pro- portional the amount of protein within the loaded sample of muscle homogenate. However, this convention assumes that the protein of interest is the only protein changing within the cellular environment. Since this study em- ployed heat stress, which is known to significantly elevate Hsps, it is possible that a muscle receiving a prior heat stress would demonstrate a lower percentage of Type I MHC per volume of muscle relative to non-heat-stressed muscles. This could result in significantly decreased band intensity for Type I MHC compared to a non-heatstres- sed muscle, even though Type I MHC protein content remained similar between the two muscles. Hence, the presentation of Type I MHC blots within this report may not provide an accurate indication regarding the effect of overload on plantaris muscle hypertrophy between heat- stressed and non-heat-stressed animals. Therefore, quan- tification of Type I MHC content within plantaris muscles was determined by correlating a given Type I MHC band intensity with Type I MHC content from a standard curve (r = 0.9853), constructed from the band intensities of a standard of control plantaris homogenate. Type I MHC content was then derived from values of total pro- tein within the muscle; total Type I MHC within a given plantaris muscle was determined by employing the equa- tion y = mx + b, where y = band intensity and x = content. Hence, X = y - b/m. The ratio of Type I MHC content to loaded protein volume was divided by the amount of loaded protein to obtain Type I MHC quantity ([g) per jig of protein. Total protein, determined from the product of muscle mass and protein content (ipg/mg), was multiplied by the Type I MHC quantity per jg of protein to yield a final quantity of Type I MHC (jig) and expressed as arbitrary units. Statistical analysis A 3-way analysis of variance (SigmaStat, San Jose, CA, USA) was performed using overload, heat stress, and time as conditions for each experimental group. Tukey's post hoc comparisons were used to assess significant dif- ferences between individual treatments at each time point. Differences between groups were considered sta- tistically significant at a level of P - 0.05.

Heat stress and hypertrophy 135 mass for non-heat-stressed overloaded animals on all days combined was 340 + 4 g, while the mean body mass for heat-stressed overloaded animals for all days com- bined was 346 + 6 g. No significant difference in body mass was observed between these groups, and thus any differences found among the experimental muscle groups after standardizing muscle mass to body mass were at- tributed to changes in plantaris muscle mass. A significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in plantaris mass, up to a maximum increase of 86% on day 7, was observed for non-heat-stressed overloaded muscles at all time points (1-7 days) examined when compared to contra- lateral control muscles. Plantaris muscles from the ani- mals that received a heat stress prior to overload also demonstrated a significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) plantaris mass than their respective contralateral control muscles at all time points (1-7 days) examined, with day 5 mea- suring a 60% increase. However, overloaded muscles that received a prior heat stress did not continue to show sig- nificant increases in muscle mass beyond day 1 and there- after when compared to the non-heat-stressed overload- ed plantaris muscles. Overloaded plantaris muscles dem- onstrated an increased mass over the first 3 days with or without a prior heat stress. However, only the non-heat- stressed overloaded plantaris muscles demonstrated con- tinuing increased mass after day 3. Following 1 week of overload, there was a significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) mass from the heat-stressed plantaris muscles compared with the non-heat-stressed plantaris muscles. Therefore, the results appear to reflect an initial increase in muscle mass in both heat-stressed and non-heat-stressed animals with a distinguishing pattern of mass change identifying an attenuating effect of heat stress after 3 days of overload. Rectal temperature responses The thermal responses of heat-stressed animals demon- strated a mean heat stress temperature between 42.1 + 0.0°C and 42.2 + 0.2°C for all animals on all days. Prior to heat stress, no significant differences in rectal temper- ature (or muscle temperature; data not shown) were ob- served between groups. By design, the animals subjected to the 15-minute 42°C heat stress demonstrated a signif- icantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) mean rectal temperature than prior to heat stress, indicating the heat-stressed animals experienced a significant elevation in core temperature stress. There were no significant differences in rectal tem- peratures between any groups of animals during the heat stress treatment, nor were there any differences in the rate of heating (0.3°C/min), suggesting that all animals ex- perienced a similar temperature stress. Hsp72 accumulation following overload and heat stress Western blot analysis and quantification of Hsp72 from heat-stressed and non-heat-stressed muscles is shown in Figure 1. Non-heat-stressed contralateral control plantar- is muscles demonstrated no significant alteration in Hsp72 content at any time following overload. In contrast, overloaded plantaris muscles from animals not subjected to heat stress demonstrated a significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) Hsp72 content on the third day. Furthermore, with overload (no heat stress), Hsp72 content remained ele- vated throughout the experiment when compared to con- tralateral control muscles.

The effects of heat stress on protein concentration with and without overload are shown in Figure 4.

Type I MHC content Since plantaris overload causes both an increased muscle mass as well as increased Type I MHC expression (Noble et al 1983, Locke et al 1994, Plyley et al 1998, Macpherson et al 1999), it was necessary to consider changes in Type I MHC in context to changes in muscle mass. After 1 day of overload, plantaris muscle Type I MHC content re- mained unchanged frona their respective contralateral controls, regardless of whether animals experienced a prior heat stress (no significant differences were ob- served).

In contrast to overload alone, when a prior heat stress was experienced, it effectively attenuated the accumula- tion of Type I MHC at days 1, 5, and 7 of overload. DISCUSSION Muscle contractions of a specific intensity and duration are transduced into the necessary biochemical signals that lead to an increased muscle mass (hypertrophy). Thus, an increased muscle mass may be considered a pro- tective response to functional overload. Since Hsps confer protection against protein damaging stresses, ascertain- ing whether a prior induction of Hsps via heat stress would alter the response of the plantaris muscle to func- tional overload was examined.

There are several important findings in the present study. First, plantaris Hsp72 content from non-heat- stressed animals was elevated -2-fold after 3 days of overload compared to contralateral controls but remained below the -4-fold increase over respective controls from heat-stressed muscles. Second, Hsp25 was elevated after 2 days in muscles from non-heat-stressed overloaded an- imals and was indistinguishable from overloaded mus- cles or contralateral (control) plantaris muscles that re- ceived a prior heat stress. Third, heat stress-attenuated plantaris muscle hypertrophy over the 7 days of function- al overload was examined. Although heat-stressed and non-heat-stressed muscles demonstrated similar initial gains in mass, only the non-heat-stressed overloaded plantaris wet weight continued to increase with time and was significantly greater (P &amp;lt; 0.05) than heat-stressed plantaris mass after 5 and 7 days of overload. Fourth, when compared to muscles from non-heat-stressed ani- mals, heat stress tended to lower muscle protein concen- tration (Vig/mg) at all time points examined. The pres- ence or absence of overload did not alter protein concen- tration. Fifth, although total muscle protein content was greater in the overloaded muscles regardless of heat stress, a prior heat stress reduced total muscle protein content. Lastly, the accumulation of Type I MHC was at- tenuated in overloaded muscles subjected to a prior heat stress. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy The overload model employed in this study is well estab- lished and results in increased muscle mass (Hubbard et al 1975, lanuzzo and Chen 1979, Locke et al 1994). There- fore, it is not surprising that overload alone was sufficient to increase plantaris muscle mass with or without heat Cell Stress &amp; Chaperones (2007) 12 (2), 132-141</page><page sequence="8">Heat stress and hypertrophy 139 stress, while the ratio of contralateral control muscle to body mass remained unchanged indicating that any al- tered gate from the surgery did not effect baseline values. However, the magnitude of increased mass is dependent on heat stress; that is, heat stress was able to prevent the overloaded plantaris muscle from elevating total mass past the initial increase observed on day 1. An early ob- servation regarding the cellular stress response was that protein-damaging stresses that induced Hsp72 were as- sociated with a reduced or arrested synthesis of many other cellular proteins (Welch 1987). Functional overload but not heat stress caused an im- mediate increase in wet weight (-50%). However, over- load, with and without heat stress, elevated muscle mass over contralateral control muscles; therefore, the stress of functional overload led to increased mass independent of heat stress. Nonetheless, the possibility that heat stress alters the effects of functional overload on the plantaris muscle is supported. In particular, heat-stressed over- loaded muscles did not increase mass beyond the first day, whereas mass continued to increase in overloaded muscles not receiving a prior heat stress. Hence, the typ- ical pattern of compensatory hypertrophy reflected by a sequential continuity of increasing mass was attenuated by heat stress. A previous study has indicated that heat stress may enhance hypertrophy in avian species (Halevy et al 2001); however, this effect followed a mild heat stress (37'C vs -42'C in the present study) and was limited to very young animals. Additionally, a more recent study has demonstrated an increased soleus muscle mass in rats fol- lowing a 41'C heat stress (Uehara et al 2004). However, these animals were not subjected to overload, and the elevated mass was observed only at day 7 but remained unchanged at all other time points. Hsps and skeletal muscle hypertrophy The mechanism(s) by which heat stress attenuated the typical pattern of compensatory hypertrophy may be dis- cerned from the Hsp expression pattern. Both Hsp25 and Hsp72 demonstrated an increased expression following overload and heat stress; both were significantly elevated (P &amp;lt; 0.05) 24 hours following heat stress and following overload without heat stress were significantly elevated (P &amp;lt; 0.05) at 2 and 3 days, respectively. Cellular Hsp levels are thought to reflect a general degree of stress within a tissue or for the entire organism (Krebs and Fed- er 1997). In this case, significantly increased Hsps follow- ing overload suggests the protein stress associated with functional overload was sufficient to activate the cellular stress response. Although the consequence of heat stress was to attenuate hypertrophy, Hsp25 and Hsp72 dem- onstrated different patterns of accumulation. Thus, it re- mains possible that the role(s) of Hsp25 and Hsp72 in both heat stress and functional overload are independent of each other. Compensatory hypertrophy and Hsp72 The finding that Hsp72 content was increased in over- loaded muscles that did not receive a prior heat stress suggests a role for Hsp72 in the hypertrophic process. Hsp72 has been shown to be expressed in a muscle-spe- cific manner and thus may also be important during mus- cle adaptation (Locke et al 1994). It may suggest a unique quality and quantity of stress associated with functional overload; that is, the amount of stress applied to the plan- taris muscle following overload led to an increased Hsp72 content and also led to hypertrophy. Hsp72 is typically observed to increase rapidly following stress, such as af- ter a 15-minute 42TC heat stress. However, the stress of overload resulted in a significantly lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) amount of Hsp72 than following heat stress. Therefore, if the amount of stress and homeostatic disruption is a mea- sure of Hsp72 elicitation, then overload may be consid- ered a less stressful condition than heat stress. Nonethe- less, Hsp72 content was significantly increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05), indicating that functional overload caused a significant stress to the plantaris muscle. Moreover, Hsp72 may be elicited in an intensity-dependent fashion (Milne and No- ble 2002), and its accumulation after overload reflects the magnitude of strain to the plantaris. In support, Mac- pherson et al (1999) attributed decreases in maximum te- tanic force production within the first week following overload to muscle fiber degeneration. Hence, the ob- served increase in Hsp72 within the first week may re- flect muscle fiber degeneration, but the expression signal generated is sufficient to elicit only a fraction of the max- imum amount of Hsp72 observed following heat stress. Alternatively, overload-induced Hsp72 may indicate an increased requirement for the chaperoning duties of Hsp72. Compensatory hypertrophy and Hsp25 There were similar increases in Hsp25 content following both overload and heat stress, such that when compared to contralateral controls, a significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) elevation in Hsp25 content was observed after 2 days. Furthermore, the amount of Hsp25 was indistinguishable from that ob- served in overloaded plantaris muscles that received heat stress. The finding that Hsp25 was similarly increased in the overloaded plantaris from both the heat-stressed and the non-heat-stressed muscles suggests that the stress as- sociated with functional overload and heat stress may be of a similar quality in terms of the ability to elicit Hsp25. Therefore, Hsp25 may have a role in stabilization, remod- Cell Stress &amp; Chaperones (2007) 12 (2), 132-141</page><page sequence="9">140 Frier and Locke eling, and/or maintenance of the cytoskeleton and skel- etal muscle filaments during various stresses. The accu- mulation of Hsp25 within the first 2 days of sustained overload without further significant increases may indi- cate that the strain to the plantaris muscle did not accu- mulate and may have been attenuated by the increased expression of Hsp25. Alternatively, it may indicate that the stress of functional overload is capable of eliciting maximal expression of Hsp25. Protein concentration Although both functional overload and heat stress inde- pendently increased Hsp content, these stresses can be distinguished by their effect on protein concentration. Heat stress but not overload reduced the muscle protein concentration. There are several factors that may have contributed to the lowered protein concentration with heat stress, including an increased mass via increased water retention (edema) and/or a net loss of cellular pro- teins. Given that both protein concentration and the ratio of muscle mass to body mass of heat-stressed animals was lower than non-heat-stressed animals, it suggests that heat stress may facilitate the loss of cellular proteins. Type I MHC content It is well known that increased muscle fiber size and in- creased protein content occur following overload (Hub- bard et al 1975, Plyley et al 1998, Macpherson et al 1999). During the process of muscle hypertrophy, muscle fibers adapt by increasing the number of sarcomeres, mostly in parallel (peripheral accumulation of sarcomeres) and, to a much lesser extent, in series (elongation of existing fi- bers). In addition, depending on the nature of the con- tractile stimulus, the expression of the MHC isoforms may also be altered. Following overload, there is an in- creased expression of the slow or Type I MHC and a reduction in the percentage of the fast or Type II MHC (Locke et al 1994). Thus, it was not surprising that results from the present study showed that overload alone led to an elevation in muscle mass, total muscle protein, and Type I MHC content relative to respective contralateral controls. However, a surprising finding was that when a single heat stress was provided prior to overload, there was a diminished accruement of plantaris muscle mass, total muscle protein content, and Type I MHC. While the mechanism for these results remains unclear, several possibilities are tenable. A prior increase in Hsps may have afforded some protection to muscle fibers dur- ing the initial stages of overload such that the stress ex- perienced during overload may have been diminished. If the stress to a muscle fiber is minimized via Hsps, the fibers with an elevated Hsp content may be better able to cope with the stress associated with overload. Thus, if fewer fibers were strained, there may have been a re- duced requirement to increase various hypertrophic pa- rameters. Overload-induced Type I MHC accumulation was attenuated by heat stress and may also be related to an impaired cellular protein production (Krebs and Feder 1997). Regardless, the present study suggests there may be a mechanistic interaction between heat stress and func- tional overload over 1 week. In conclusion, although overload increased mass with and without heat stress, diminished protein concentration and attenuated total protein and Type I MHC accrual suggests a pseudohypertrophy with heat stress. Overload was ultimately able to increase muscle contents of Hsp25 to the same degree as heat stress alone, suggesting a sim- ilar ability of either heat stress or overload to regulate Hsp25 expression. In contrast, heat stress with or without overload resulted in an increase of -4-fold in Hsp72, whereas overload alone was able to significantly elevate (P &amp;lt; 0.05) Hsp72 quantities only to half the levels ob- tained via heat stress. The lack of expressive uniformity between Hsp25 and Hsp72 exposes an adapted ability to respond specifically to a host of unique and specific stim- uli. Moreover, attenuation of overload-induced hypertro- phy via heat stress likewise underscores the cell's voli- tional ability to override powerful and overt signals when challenged by exceptional circumstances.
