<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER SMITH University of Wisconsin, Madison, W1537o6 IMAGES OF DIVINE KINGS FROM THE MUKTESVARA TEMPLE, BHUBANESWAR* T he Muktesvara temple at Bhubaneswar, Orissa was built ca. 950-975 A.D. (fig. i).1 It is dedicated to Siva, as are virtually all the temples at this site. While modest in size (its iikhara or shrine tower rises only to a height of about 34 feet), the temple is a masterpiece in its proportional refinement, its high degree of finish and detail, and its many-faceted iconographical program. This paper will discuss two aspects of this program. Of primary concern are three relief carvings that may be identified as depictions of kings, prominently placed on the temple's iikhara. I shall discuss the basis for this identification, and the significance of the images' location. Essentially, they depict kings as gods, and illustrate the nature of divine kingship in tenth-century Orissa. The images refer not to a cult where the king himself is worshipped as a high god, but to a conception of the king as a "deputy" of the major divinity, namely Siva, the king's reign being legitimized through his close relationship to the deity. Another concern of this paper involves the architectural application of the symbolism of the pancamukhalinga, an image of Siva as absolute godhead. I suggest that this symbolism is integrated with, and provides a support for, the temple's presentation of divinized kings. The Royal Images The images under discussion are placed at the lowest level of elaborate relief carvings, heraldic in their overall effect, set on all four sides of the iikhara (fig. 2). This heraldic device, or candraadld, almost resembling a coat of arms, is essentially an elaborate arched window motif. Dominating the middle section of the superstruc- ture, the candraiald is made up of swirling vegetal elements emitted from the mouth of the monster-head (kirtimukha) at its apex. All of this is supported, or displayed, by two demonic dwarf figures (ganas, spirit- attendants of Siva). A separate image, above this, carved in high relief, shows Siva as Natesa, lord of dance. At the center of the candraidld design is a smaller window-form which houses the small image of a face. Below this is one of the sculptures under discussion. The candraiald on the south (fig. 3) shows a seated male figure with three attendants. The scale is hieratic, the seated figure being twice as large as the others. He sits on the ground in a relaxed and easy pose; his right foot is crossed over his left thigh, and he appears to be holding a sword in the right hand. His figure is ample, even rotund, and his hair is pulled into an elaborate bun. Though not carved in minute detail, various pieces of jewelry are evident, a necklace, arm bands, and bracelets. One attendant figure squats before him, while behind stand two men, one holding what is perhaps a spear with a banner attached to it. This and the two associated reliefs (figs. 4 and 5) have previously been identified as depictions of ascetic gurus giving instructions to their disciples,2 a group that is indeed found many times on the Mukteivara (fig. 6), and on other Orissan temples. In those examples, the gurus, and their disciples as well, are * I would like to thank Professor Sheldon Pollock, University of Chicago, for criticism of an earlier form of this paper. 1 This is the date upon which most scholars concur, mainly on the basis of stylistic analysis. See K. C. Panigrahi, Archaeological Remains at Bhubaneswar (Calcutta, i96i); Krishna Deva, Temples of North India (New Delhi, 1969); Walter Smith, "The Mukteivara Temple at Bhubaneswar: a Contextual Study of its Architecture and Sculptural Program" (Ph. D. thesis, University of Iowa, 1984); and Thomas E. Donaldson, Hindu Temple Art of Orissa (Leiden, 1985-86). 2 Alice Boner and S. R. Sarma, trans, The kilpa Prakaia (Leiden, 1966), pp. 44-45; Thomas Donaldson, "Development of the Vajra-Mastaka on Orissan Temples," East and West, 26.3-4 (0976), pp. 427-28. More recently, in Hindu Temple Art, Donaldson identifies the Mukteivara reliefs and similar examples as depictions of kings, but does not give a detailed explanation for his identification. He states briefly the possibility that images of kings, by their prominent placement, seem to indicate divine status, but he does not attempt to interpret the function and meaning of the images as part of the iconographical programs of the temples to which they are attached.

An early iconographical treatise, the Visnudharmottara (ca. seventh century), describes the way such figures are to be depicted. "The sages are to be adorned with bundled-up locks of hair...and though physically weak, are full of spiritual lustre (tejas)."3 The benign expressions of both guru and disciples convey well this idea of inner spiritual radiance, but it is the textual emphasis on the "physical weakness" of the ascetics, portrayed by almost skeletal figures, that is important here, for it is a physical description in complete contrast to the Mukteivara reliefs. Those robust figures are much more analogous to textual descriptions of the ideal king, who is most strongly characterized by his strength and physical well-being. He is also often likened to the great heroes of epic and legend, as wellas to warrior-deities like Indra, king of the gods.4 The overall compositional layout of the ascetic panel, specifically the emphasis on hieratic scale, however, is quite similar to that of the royal reliefs, and helps to explain how the latter could be taken as depictions of ascetic sages.5 That the Muktesvara panels indeed depict kings may be ascertained through comparison with sculptures that we know with certainty are depictions of royal figures. Of the many images of king Narasirhihadeva I, the thirteenth-century monarch who built the Sun temple at Konarak, we may look at an example carved on the base of the large image-pedestal placed within the Sun temple's sanctum (fig. 7, see also fig. 10).6 Larger than all surrounding figures, he greets the man seated before him while the other figures offer obeisance. The physical build of the king, his hair style, ornaments, and weapons, are all strikingly similar to those of the main figures of the Mukteivara reliefs. The reliefs of the east and north candraidld of the Mukteivara echo the general composition of the image on the southern side. The eastern relief (fig. 4) shows the royal figure flanked by a spear-bearer and a woman holding a cauri (fly-whisk). He is of the same physical type as the figure in the southern relief, and has a knife strapped to his belt. On the north side (fig. 5) the king sits on a low dais, rather than on the ground, and is flanked by two female cauri-bearers. In the window design above is an image of Siva as Natesa. In all three cases, the horizontal strips flanking the central relief, at the lowest edge of the large candraidld, also bear imagery relating to royalty. In figure 2 we see an elephant caravan. Another relief from Konarak again shows Narasirhihadeva, this time mounted on an elephant, with a caravan led by soldiers depicted below.7 Another activity closely associated with royalty is that of the hunt, as seen throughout Epic and Pura.nic literature, and in all periods of Indian art.' This is the subject matter of the relief bands flanking the southern relief, just visible in figure 3. Delineated briefly above, then, is the theme of kings in Indian art. They are shown as robust, full-bodied figures, adorned with jewelry, bearing weapons, and attended by courtiers, and often are surrounded by 3 C. Sivaramamurti, Chitrasutra of the Vishnudharmottara (New Delhi, 1978), pp. 185. 4 See Jan Gonda, Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View (Leiden, 1966), p. 35, where abundant references from epic literature are cited, such as Rdmayana 1. 1.8 ff., where Rama is described as broad-shouldered and long-armed, a description given to various other rulers, such as Nala (Mahbbhdrata 3.53.II, also Mdrkandaya Purdna 74-5i). It should be noted also that the epithet mahibdhu, "having great arms," is also given to Visnu, the prototype for the protective role of the king (Mahabharata 5.70.9). The ideal of the cakravartin of course also immediately comes to mind. s The controversial architectural treatise, kilpa Prakdia, p. 44, refers to such scenes as iiksaddna, "imparting instruction." 6 For additional images of Narasirhihadeva I see Donaldson, Hindu Temple Art, figs. 1359, 4212, and 4225. 7 Ibid., fig. 4241. 8 To give a brief overview here, we may cite the various jdtaka stories in which the Bodhisattva, in an animal incarnation, is the subject of a king's hunt [Rurujitaka (E. B. Cowell, ed., TheJatakas or Stories of the Buddha's Former Births (London, 1957), vol. 4, P. 163; and Sdmajdtaka (ibid., vol. 6, p. 43)]. At the beginning of the tale of Sakuntala in the Mahabharata [J. A. B. van Buitenen, trans, The Mahabhdrata, vol. I: The Book of the Beginning (Chicago, 1973), pp. 156-6o], and in the opening scenes of Kaalidisa's play [A. W. Ryder, Shakuntala and Other Writings by Kalidasa (New York, 1959), pp. 5-6], the story begins by describing King Dusyanta pursuing deer into the sacred hermitage of Kanva. Depictions of royal hunts (illustrating the jdtakas mentioned above) are found at Ajanta, Caves io (Sdmajdtaka), and 17 (Rurujataka). See M. Singh, Ajanta (New York, 1965), fig. 3, pls. 17 and i9. For the Ruruj'taka at Bharhut see H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia (New York, i96o), fig. 3-a. Other published examples of royal hunting scenes are from the Rini Gumpa, Udayagiri, Orissa (Zimmer, ibid., pl. 57), and the Laksmana temple, Khajuraho (E. Zannas and J. Auboyer, Khajuraho, S-Gravenhage, i96o), p. 64]. 91</page><page sequence="3">references to the hunt and the battle. This is the iconographical scheme used in the three reliefs from the Mukteivara temple, which, as depictions of kings at court, are distinguished from representations of gurus with their disciples. As stated above, the depictions of kings on the Muktesvara temple show the royal figures not simply as earthly rulers, but through their placement and other iconographical associations, are presented in a way that affirms their own divinity and their close relationship with Siva. First, however, it is necessary to set the stage for an interpretation of the Mukteivara reliefs as images of divine kings, discussing, first, the idea of divine kingship in ancient India in general and in Orissa in particular, showing the conceptual context out of which the images arise; and second, the conception of the temple itself as a divine image, an architectural parallel of an image presenting Siva as the absolute, supreme, all-encompassing totality, the pafncamukhalinga (linga with five faces). Divine Kingship in the Brahmanical and Orissan Traditions On many levels, symbolic, metaphorical, and at times even literal, the Indian king is considered to be divine.' This divinity is instilled in him during the ceremony of consecration, the mahabhis.eka, a ritual bath which constitutes a reenactment of the consecration of Indra, endowing the king with divine power and prosperity (sri).10 A painting from Ajanta illustrating the abhiseka of Prince Mahajanaka (fig. 8) shows the royal figure flanked on either side by attendants who literally shower him with water poured from huge pots. The overall composition, with the symmetrical arrangement and the hieratic scale of the prince, closely resembles the standard image of Gajalaksmi, the goddess of fortune, also called Sri, being lustrated by elephants, which in Orissa particularly is often depicted on the lintels of temple entrances (fig. 9)." This analogy suggests that the king is being not only consecrated, but worshiped through lustration, as is the goddess. The parallel also suggests that the king, like Gajalaksmi, is seen as a god of prosperity, whose presence endows the kingdom with good fortune, peace, abundance, and so forth.' In India, the king was not identified with the highest, absolute form of divinity, as he may have been in the devardja cult of southeast Asia.13 Instead, he was seen more on the level of the Vedic gods, who during the post- Vedic period are minor figures, but who embody traits and virtues to be valued in a king, particularly physical strength and prowess. Numerous passages in the Mahabharata refer to the strength of the king, to the might of his arms, and such an ideal king is often called rajendra, "Indra among kings" (Indra being king of the gods)." 9 Fundamental studies of Indian kingship are E. W. Hopkins, "The Divinity of Kings,"Journal of the American Oriental Society (1931), pp. 309- 316; and John W. Spellman, Political Theory of Ancient India (Oxford, 1964). Enlightening recent studies are Jan Gonda, Ancient Indian Kingship; and Sheldon Pollock, "The Divine King in the Indian Epic," Journal of the American Oriental Society 1o4.3 (1984), pp. 5o50- 528. That the question of the Indian king's literal divinity is controversial can be seen in two papers published in The Sacral Kingship: Contributions to the Central Theme of the VIIIth International Contress for the History of Religions (Leiden, 1959). A. Basu in "Hindu Doctrine of Divine Kingship," pp. 167- 71, considers that it was Indian kingship and not the person of the king himself that bore divine status. Jan Gonda in "The Sacred Character of Ancient Indian Kingship," pp. 172-1 8o, states emphatically that the Indian king was indeed a god, specifically a deva, having within his being the essence of the lokapalas, the guardians of the universe. In "The Divine King," Pollock provides numerous references to the king's divinity, particularly from the epics (pp. 5 52 ff. ). Considering the negativity toward the notion of the king's god-hood in the dharmasastras, Pollock rightly states that "even if these denials are contemporary with [the epics], the fact that they at the same time imply a widespread belief is something we should not ignore" (p. 523)- '0 See Gonda, Indian Kingship, pp. 8o, 81. The main text Gonda cites is the Aitareya Brahmana, specifically 7.20.5 ff., and 8.14.4. 1 For an illustration and discussion of a god's abhiseka, see J. Williams, The Art of Gupta India (Princeton, 1983), P. 72 and pl. 76, a fifth-century image from Mathura where Kumara is "anointed" as the general of the gods by Siva and Brahma, both holding jars. 2 Various references suggest a subtle conceptual interrelation between Laksmi/Sri and the prosperity (iri) of the king. Gonda has shown how parts of the king's throne are to be identified with sri[Aspects of Early Visnuism (Delhi, 1954), pp. 188 ff. ]. The Visnu Smrti states that Laksmi (Sri) resides in the white sunshade of State (99.12), as well as in the royal consecration (abhiseka)itself (99.16). See Gonda, Indian Kingship, p. 37. 13 This is the classic interpretation given by G. Coedes in such works as "Le culte de la royaute divinisee, source d'inspiration de grands monuments du Cambodge ancien," Serie Orientale Roma, vol. I (1952), pp. 1-23. An extensive challenge to Coedis' ideas is H. Kulke, "Der Devaraja-Kult. Legitimation und Herrscherapotheose im Angkor Reich," Saeculum 25 (1974). Trans. and reprint 95, Southeast Asia Data Program Paper, no. 118, Ithaca, 1978. A full list of Coed s' writings on the subject may be found in Kulke's bibliography. 14 See note 4. 92</page><page sequence="4">Kings are said to embody the essences of the lokapdlas, the guardians of the directions, Vedic dieties who oversee the limits of creation." Sharing the essence of these gods who oversee and protect the entire world, the king is first and foremost a protector, a preserver of order, or dharma. His existence is thought to preserve order, and a land without a king is a land in complete chaos.16 The role of the king as protector par excellence apparently gave rise to an identification of the Indian king with Visnu, the supreme protector, the preserver of the universe, by the early Puranic period. Texts like the Vayu Purdna (52.72), show the nature of this identification: "Every emperor...is born with a portion of Visnu within him."l1 This identification was made not only within theoretical religious texts, but also with historical kings. At the end of Visakadatha's Mudrardksasa, the author refers to his royal patron (possibly Candragupta), as Visnu.18 More relevant to the present study is an inscription of the ninth-century Orissan king Sivagupta Bilirjuna, who is described as an aspect of Visnu. Sivagupta, like most kings of both the early and later Somavambi dynasties, was a devotee of Siva [the usual epithet describing them is paramamaheivara, "having Siva (Maheivara) as one's chief aim"], and it is interesting in this light that the inscription also gives expression to the ideas of Visnu's subservience to Siva.19 A mythological parallel is seen in the myth of Lifigodbhava, where Siva reveals himself as the essence of a fiery shaft, or lihga, of which neither Visnu nor Brahma could find the source, so that they were compelled to worship Siva as the supreme lord. We have just seen two apparently contradictory aspects of divine kingship in India; namely, that while the king is a deva, or an aspect of Visnu, he is still a worshipper (albeit the chief one) of the supreme deity. This leads to the important point that the role of the king as a divine worshipper, while superficially contradictory, is really essential to his function. This has been pointed out by Jan Gonda. A consideration of the Vedic gods shows that they themselves perform sacrifices in order to gain victory, possessions, and to insure universal order.20 The gods, then, perform rituals and acts of worship for many of the reasons that mortals do. In the Orissan tradition (particularly before the twelfth century) the king is consistently referred to as paramamahe'- vara. The role of the king as chief worshipper is also seen in the cult of Jagananaitha, which began to achieve great prominence in the twelfth century with the building of the great Jagannitha temple at Puri. By the thirteenth century a true royal cult is fully observable, with the king as the chief worshipper and a kind of deputy, or even earthly reflection, of the great god.21 Two more images of the thirteenth-century king Narasirmhadeva clearly show the king's role as both god and worshipper. One stele shows the king worshipping a triad consisting of the goddess Durga, Purusottama (later known as Jagannitha), and a livalihga.22 The king is of regal bearing and heroic proportions, but he is nevertheless shown in the subservient role. An altogether different conception is seen in another stele showing Narasirniha enthroned on a swing (fig. io). The format is frankly iconic, with the king in a frontal pose, and flanked symmetrically by worshipping attendants. The arch of the swing that frames the king is very similar to the arches surrounding Durga and Purusottama in the stele of Narasirhiha worshipping. In both cases, it acts as ' Gonda, Indian Kingship, pp. 9 and i6 (citing Mdnava Dharmaiatra 7.3 and 5.97), and 36 (citing BhAgavata Pur na 4.I3.23). For a definition of lokapila as a guardian of one of the four cardinal directions (as opposed to all eight, as Gonda takes the term), see Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple (Calcutta, 1946, reprint New Delhi, 1977) p. 9L. 16 Pollock, "Divine King," p. 526, citing the Ahirbudhnya Sambitd I6.14-19. 7 Ibid., p. 526 18 Ibid., citing Mudrdriksasa 7. ig. 19 S. N. Rajaguru, Inscriptions of Orissa (Bhubaneswar, 1966), vol. 4, PP. 48- 5I. Several other inscriptions from the Somavamsi period make allusions to royal godhood. See ibid., pp. 63, 76, 223 (referring to minor kings who worship the king's feet); 227, where Yayati II is referred to as the son (jdta) of Madhus udana. A predecessor of the Pindava king Bharatabala is called "a deity and a supreme divinity (adhidaivatd)," ibid., pp. 1o, 15, while his consort is called "of'divine origin," ibid., pp. 9, 16. 20 Gonda, Indian Kingship, p. 15, citing Rdmdyana 2.xx3.23; and Mahbbhbrata 1.74.129, 3.293.2. 21 H. Kulke, "Early Royal Patronage of the Jagannatha Cult," in A. Eschmann, et al., eds., The Cult ofJagannath and the Regional Tradition of Orissa (New Delhi, 1978), pp. I5I-153; H. Kulke, "Jagannatha as the State Deity under the Gajapatis of Orissa," ibid., pp. 2oo, 20I. The usurper kings of the early Su-ryavamsi dynasty tried to set themselves up as Jagannitha's deputies in the mid-fifteenth century, necessary in a kingdom that had been dedicated to the god two centuries earlier. See Kulke, pp. 204-205. 22 Donaldson, Hindu Temple Art, fig. 3843. 93</page><page sequence="5">an enclosing shrine.23 A devotional attitude is seen particularly in the figures below, who worship the foot of the king as it extends down toward them. As Hermann Kulke points out, this motif of worshipping feet is a standard feature of many icons, as several examples clearly show.24 Narasirihha's conceptions of himself as a deity corresponds with the status of the king of Puri today, Puri being the center of the Jagannatha cult. We know, first of all, that the king of Puri is known as calanti Visnu, "mobile Visnu," in other words, a living incarnation.25 In line with this, the audience he gives to pilgrims is called darsana, "vision," a term which usually refers to the viewing of a god. Also, many rituals usually thought of as belonging to gods (or images of gods), are performed for the king (ritual waking up, bathing, offering of food, and so forth.)26 As pointed out above, this had occurred in earlier periods, and in ancient India the king also gave dariana to his subjects,27 hence the practices at Puri are nothing new. However, they do show a firmly documented occurrence of worshipful veneration of kings in Orissa. It should be pointed out too, that the king of Puri also acts as the chief ritual functionary of Lord Jaganna-tha, a role that seems inextricable from his own divine status. There are no historical records to indicate whether the earlier temples at Bhubaneswar were expressions of a royal cult of the same magnitude that appears at Puri. But we can see with particular clarity in the Muktesvara temple an expression of the king as both a divine being and the chief worshipper of the supreme lord. As stated earlier, the candraidld designs which bear the relief depictions of kings are placed on all four sides of the superstructure of the Muktesvara temple. There are only three reliefs depicting kings, however, because the candraidld above the entrance way, hidden as it is by the pyramidal roof of the forehall, is unfinished. But conceptually, there are four candraidlas, and by extension, four images of kings. The fourfold candraidlds embody a complex iconography, whereby they can be seen as constituent parts of an abstract image of Siva, specifically, the panicamukalihga, the "lihga with five faces" (fig. i i). Relating the temple to the symbolism of thepan-camukhalinga is complementary to what has become the classic interpretation of the Hindu temple, the temple as an image of the cosmic purusa, having at its base the symbolic plan of the vastupurusamandala.2 The directional, celestial, and cosmic symbolism of the vastupurusamandala strongly parallels that of the pafn- camukhalinga. In its turn, the symbolism of the lihga provides a specifically Saivite perspective in interpreting temples dedicated to that god. The relevance of this symbolism to the Mukteivara's royal images will, I hope, become clear in the following pages. The Mukteivara Temple as Panicamukhalihga Observations on the similarities of north Indian iikharas in general to the livalihga, specifically the panicamukhalihga, have been made previously by Stella Kramrisch. Referring to the Siddhesvara temple at Bhubaneswar, she states that the central rathas (vertical offsets, pilasters, buttresses) of the iikhara "are akin to the form of a four-faced Siva-Lifiga," adding that the lihga is, in anthropomorphic imagery, analogous to the architectural symbolism of the temple buttresses facing the four directions.29 What Kramrisch alludes to is that just as the faces of Siva seem to emerge from the surface of the lihga, so too do the rathas, or offsets seem to project out from the iikhara's core. This analogy can be taken much further, particularly when temples with 23 In Indian imagery the arches behind image-pedestals and thrones generally bear similar symbols, a makara at the top, vydlas (leogryphs) at the sides, and elephants at the base, these referring to the celestial, intermediate, and terrestrial realms respectively. In the context of the throne, these symbols may refer to the king being a universal monarch who rules over the three worlds. See J. Auboyer, "Le caracte're royal et divin du trone dan l'Inde ancienne," Sacral Kingship, pp. 18 5-186; also see Le Tr6ne et son symbolisme dans l'Inde ancienne, Paris, 1949, pp. 105- 18 5. 24 Kulke, "State Deity," p. 203.

It will be shown here how the elaborate imagery of the candraidld, taken together with the configuration of the sikhara itself, leads to an interpretation of the Muktesvara, and various other temples as well, as architectural analogues to the pancamukhalihga. The pancamukhalihga represents Siva as Sadifiva, "eternal and immanent ?iva," the supreme embodiment of all existence. Each of the five different faces or aspects represents some facet of this totality, on a variety of levels. Briefly,30 each aspect is associated with one of the five directions, one of the five elements, and with one of the five ontological principles of Simkhya philosophy. Each is also assigned a iakti, or female power. Sadisiva-Isina, the face of the zenith, is the aspect of Siva beyond manifestation, and is the god in complete transcendency. In sculpture he is rarely depicted anthropomorphically, but is understood to exist at the curved summit of the linga. In accordance with his rarified nature, he is associated with the element dkila, "ether" or "space." His iakti is Paridakti, transcendental consciousness. The progressive tangible aspects of existence are embodied in the four directional faces below; Mahideva-Tatpurusa, Bhairava-Aghora, Umi-Vamadeva, and Nandin-Sadyojita. This whole complex scheme is known as the pancabrahmans, or the "five mantras" of Siva. Its overall meaning is summed up in a passage from the Pancabrahman Upanisad: With the knowing of the fivefold Brahmans...one should know that all this phenomenal world is Parabrahman, Siva...whatever is seen or heard or falls within or lives beyond the range of his inner or outer senses, (one should know) as Siva of the character of the fivefold Brahmans alone.31 The paficamukhalihga, then, is a symbolic representation of God as totality, and the phenomenal universe is but part of his body. Now to return to the suggestion that the Muktesvara temple has a conceptual basis similar to that of the paficamukhalihga. First, the formal similarities pointed out by Kramrisch are strongly evident, with the central offsets of the iikhara projecting into space just as the faces of the lihga do (compare figs. i and i1) In addition, the lower levels of the iikhara on the north, south, and east sides contain elaborate networks of imagery in the large candraidld devices described earlier, superimposed upon the central offsets, with the west one, obscured by the roof of the forehall, left unfinished. At the center of the large window is another, much smaller candraidld. It projects out from the surface of the larger design and has within it a small face resembling that of a Buddha image which, I would argue, is a representation of Siva. Behind this candraidld, and largely hidden by it, is an image of a closed lotus, well known as a symbol of the Goddess (fig. 2). Each element of these compositions bears some sort of Saivite reference, analogous in their fourfold repetition to the faces of Siva on the panicamukhalinga. The kirtimukha above each large window is the first of these references. While seen in conjunction with many gods of the Hindu pantheon besides Siva, its origins are discussed in purinic myths specifically within a Saivite context.3' The kirtimukha is born from the wrath of Siva, in some myths being emitted from the god's third eye. In the Padma Purdna, Siva assigns the self- devouring monster a place of honor on his temples, and requires worshippers to acknowledge its presence. The kirtimukha, originating from Siva's wrathful side, presents to the viewer a theophany of Siva and Sakti, and is a constituent part of it. On the north side of the likhara, the small candraidld bears an image of Siva Na~tefa, Lord of Dance, and so the entire window here is unproblematic as a presentation of Siva. The small faces within the south and east windows, however, have no iconographical features identifying them specifically with Siva, at least at first glance. As mentioned earlier, they resemble Buddha-heads, and it can be noted that one particular aspect of Siva, one seen over and over in Orissa, that of Lakullia, is closely related to the Buddha image and obviously is 30 See Kramrisch, The Presence of $iva (Princeton, i981) pp. 178-189. 31 Pancabrahman Upanisad 26, cited in Kramrisch, Presence, p. 187. 321See Kramrisch, Hindu Temple, vol. 2, pp. 322-331; and V. S. Agrawala, Studies in Indian Art (Varanasi, 1965), pp. 234, 237-240. IOI</page><page sequence="13">derived from it.33 Images of Lakulisa based on Buddha images take on the seated meditative posture (perhaps the original raison d'etre for the adaptation, as both Buddha and Lakulia were yogin-ascetics), the snail-curls or smooth skull, the cranial extension (sometimes omitted), and distended ear lobes. The Lakulia images are instantly distinguishable, however, because of the attribute of the club and the lack of monastic garb.34 Figures or heads of deities within candraidld windows, particularly on Buddhist monuments, may be cited from all over northern India,35 and it seems that from the Gupta period on, many of these images depict gods or celestials, not simply anonymous, decorative portraits. The general similarity between a figure of Lakulia on the Mukte'vara's enclosure wall and the faces within the candraidids of the same temple, is clearly evident (cf. figs. 3 and 12). That the candraidld images superimposed upon lotuses represent the conjunction of ?iva and Sakti may be ascertained through comparisons with other Orissan monuments. On the west side of the Para urimeivara temple's iikhara there are two superimposed candraids placed directly above the entrance to the shrine, each bearing an image of Siva (fig. 13). The bottom one depicts Giva and Parvati on Mount Kailisa, with the demon Rivana below (Rivaninugrahamiirti). The candraidld above holds an image of Sive Natesa, and above this is a figure of Lakuisa. On the Muktesvara temple, the upper candradald is eliminated, and an unframed relief of Nate a is attached to the surface. The lower emblem is also simplified, with Siva represented as a face, and the Goddess as a closed lotus behind it. The emblematic function of this lotus motif is seen more clearly on the iikhara of a temple dedicated to the Goddess herself, the Gauri temple at Bhubaneswar, which is contemporary with the Mukte vara.36 Here the face of Siva is excluded, and the dwarf figures display only the symbolic image of the Goddess. The Mukte*vara, however, shows Siva and the Goddess in conjunction. The mythological associations of the Parasurameivara's candraidlds are eliminated, replaced with emblems of a more abstract nature. But aside from this, the Siva-Sakti images, repeated on each directional face of the Muktesvara, suggest that the Saktis of the paicabrahmans have been represented along with the faces of Siva. The Saivite identification of the candraidld faces of the Muktesvara can be further strengthened by comparison with other temples. A candraidld from a niche on the Parasurimeivara temple bears the typical third eye and matted hair of Siva (fig. 14). Another candraidld from the same temple shows a three-headed image of MaheSam irti (fig. 15). The three-faced MaheSamitrti has been interpreted by Kramrisch as identical with the five-faced deity of the pancamukhalinga, the rear face being hidden from view, and the top one invisible.3' This image, along with the linga in figure i i, clearly shows that the concept of the pancabrahmans was well known in early medieval Orissa,38 thus indicating its all-Indian importance. Another MaheSamiirti image is found on the western side of the Para urameivara's sikhara, near the summit of the central ratha, capping the sequence of Rivaninugrahamu-rti, Naiefa, and Lakullia (just visible at the top of figure 13). The placement of the images is significant in that the profile heads and the "hidden" rear one can be related conceptually to the remaining sides of the iikhara. In this it bears great similarity to several temples further north, specifically in the Himalayan regions. The Maheia shrine at Jagatsukh (Himachal Pradesh), for 33 For examples see Donaldson, Hindu Temple Art, figs.-3471-3481, and passim. 3 Buddha images from various Orissan sites, notably Ratnagiri, must have served as the prototypes of the Lakui'a images. See Debala Mitra, "Ratnagiri, 1958-61," Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India 90 (i98 -83), pp. 216-224 passim. 35 Figures or heads of deities within candraGids, particularly on Buddhist monuments, occur with great frequency, and it seems that from the Gupta period on, many of these images depict gods or celestials, not simply anonymous, decorative portraits. See for example Ellora, Cave 9 [O. Viennot, Temples de l'Inde centrale et occidentale (Paris, 1976), p. io]; votive sti-pas at Nalanda (R. Craven, A Concise History of Indian Art (New York, 1976, fig. 124); and most importantly, Ratnagiri, Monastery I, third shrine facade, showing details of large candraald devices with smaller candraalds bearing seated Buddhas. See R. Brown, "The Four Stone Facades of Monastery I at Ratnagiri," Artibus Asiae, 40.1 (1978), figs. 17, 25. These can be compared iconographi- cally (as Brown does stylistically), with the large candrasals of the Muktesvara, the Buddha figures corresponding to what I identify as the heads of Siva (see ibid., fig. 24). Hindu examples from Orissa are cited in the text below, and in figs. 14, 15. 3 For an illustration and comparison with the Muketeivara's candrasal, see W.

Thomas Maxwell has taken steps toward interpreting this temple as a pancamukhalihga. Since, however, he could discern no representation of isina-Siva, the face of the zenith, he did not adopt this view, stating instead that the temple or the iikhara itself represents si'na, surrounded by the manifest aspects of Siva.40 This most rarified aspect of Siva, however, is non-manifest and beyond form, while the temple, interpreted as Purusa, the body of God, as well as four visible faces of Siva, relates to God's manifestation on the phenomenal plane. Further, the relevant texts never state, to my knowledge, that the lihga itself is li na-rather, the lihga is the totality, and bears the images that emanate from it. I ina, associated with the element dkdia, would be more appropriately represented by the temple's capping elements, the amalaka stone, the karpara ("skull," the curved surface above the amalaka), and the finial. Again the standard interpretation of the temple's capping elements lends credence to their identification in a Saivite context, with the uppermost face of the pancamukhalihga. It is easy to make analogies between this most subtle aspect of Siva, associated with the element dkdsa-ether or space-and the uppermost parts of the temple. By their very position, the capping elements symbolize the celestial world. Kramrisch discusses amalaka in particular as a symbol of passage, of exit from the world and of entry into heaven.41 And remembering how texts like the Agni Purdna (ca. ninth century) and the Samaringanasutradhdra (mid-eleventh century) describe the parts of the temple as parts of the human body, with the area above the iikhara being likened to the head, the name for the curved area above the amalaka, karpara or skull, is most suggestive.42 But the capping element with which the most intriguing analogies with the i9ana-face of Siva can be formed is the finial, the amrta kalaia, the vase of the nectar of immortality. These analogies are made in light of the existence of another type of finial, discovered by M. A. Dhaky, called the dk "alihga finial.43 The dkdialihga finial is described in various texts, such as the Samaranganasu-tradhdra, and the Laksanasamuccya (ca. thirteenth century). Temples with akdaalihga finials are found on several Orissan sites dating from the seventh to tenth centuries, for example, the Para urameivara at Bhubaneswar, the Kutai Tundi at Khiching, and the Siddhe'vara at Gandharadi. Other similarly dated examples are found in Andhra Pradesh and in the Himalayan regions.44 The term akdsalihga can be translated variously as "the lihga open to space," the "lihga consisting of space," or as the "lihga consisting of ether, Akdsa." This latter reading indicates that the lihga represents Sadisiva-liana, associated with the subtle element akdsa. The term dka'alihga alone suggests the finial's identification with the fifth, invisible head at the summit of the pancamukhalihga. This is further suggested by the Agni Purdna, which refers to another finial, the ia"Cuda, the finial of isa, or iana, which is defined as "having its upper part in lihga form." Dhaky suggests the possibility that many, if not all early medieval Siva temples from Orissa and Andhra were originally crowned with lihga-finials, since most of these temples have lost their original crowning elements. If so, then the four candraidla reliefs, along with the akdialihga finial, would have presented a powerful architectural expression of the conception of the five faces of Siva. The amrta kalaia, the more usual temple finial, seems however itself to have a conceptual affinity with the dkdialifiga. Keeping in mind the idea of the temple as the body of God, Saivite myths often describe arnrta, the " Illustrated in A. de Lippe, Indian Medieval Sculpture (New York and Amsterdam, 1978), figs. 4V, 44. 4?T.

In the context of yoga, the meaning of amrta takes on a much broader scope. It becomes a subtle element, flowing from the sahasrdra cakra (located at the top of the skull), during the highest state of meditation.47 At this time it becomes all-pervasive, permeating the being of the enlightened devotee. Here amrta takes on a subtle, expansive charactive, similar to that of akdia-ether. The similarity of dkdia and amrta is further indicated in the Yogatattva Upanisad, which described yogic physiognomy.48 In the subtle, or spiritual body, dkiA a is located at the region from the middle of the eyebrows to the top of the head, that is, at the sahasrdra cakra, which another text, the giva Sambird (ca. tenth century), calls the Akiia pankaja, the ,kiia-lotus, or cakra. Reference to the sahasrdra cakra is relevant in terms of the temple's symbolism both as the body of Purusa and as pancamukhalinga, since amrta, symbolized by the amrtakalaia, is housed within the same portion of the spiritual body as is dkasa.49 A parallel meaning for the two elements akdia and amrta is suggested architecturally by the finial of the Svargabrahma temple, Alamapur (Andhra Pradesh),"o where an amrta kalaia is placed above an akdialihga. That the summit of the temple can be taken specifically as the crown of Siva's head is again suggested textually in the Visnudharmottara, where another finial, the amalasdraka, is described. Here a cylindrical shaft (dkdialihga) is crowned with the Saivite crescent moon, the vessel of amrta and akdia. Conclusion: Kings as Gods on the Mukteivara Temple A detailed discussion of the symbolism of the Muktesvara temple's iikhara is of great relevance to the central topic of this paper, the meaning of the royal images located practically at the center of each directional side of the sikhara. As a support for the royal images, the likhara serves several functions. First, as an image of Purusa, who embodies the entire cosmos,51 the iikhara lends a kind of cosmic, celestial setting for the images, placing them in the "heavenly sphere," which strongly suggests the kings' divinized status.52 Also, regarding the directional symbolism of the temple-set forth in the iconography of the vastupurusamandala as well as in the directionally oriented pancamukhalihga-the kings can be seen as embodiments of the lokapalas, the guardians of the four cardinal directions. The formal layout of the candraidlds suggests further a close proximity between the king and Siva, with the royal images placed directly below the faces of Siva, the whole candrasald device itself being a manifestation of an aspect of Giva's being. The king can also be perceived as being in a worshipful attitude, looking upward at the image within the candraidld. Various comparisons may again be made. Similar in conception is the image of the Cola king Rajendra I from the eleventh century Brhadisvara temple at Gangaikondacolapuram, where the ruler, in worshipful obeisance, receives a garland of victory from Siva and Pirvati, a more pictorial version of the abstract representation on the Muktesvara.53 In Orissan art, the image-pedestal from the Su-rya temple 46 Bha-ravi, Kiratdrjuniya 5.44; and Somadeva, Kathisaritsagara 74.1"1: "The tasteful water of the Ganges, which seemed to be impregnated with the nectar of the moon, from dwelling on Siva's head."

See H. P. L'Orange, Studies on the Iconography of Cosmic Kingship in the Ancient World (New Rochelle, New York, 1982), especially p. 97 and figs. 69, 72, 73, 89. 53 George Michell, The Hindu Temple: an Introduction to its Meaning and Forms (New York, 1977), fig. 7. J. M. Somasundaram Pillai, The Great Temple at Tanjore (Tanjore, 1958), p.

Io4</page><page sequence="16">(fig. 7) perhaps served a similar function, with the king, while receiving obeisance from his retinue, being seated at the feet (the worshipful attitude par excellence) of the Sun god. If we accept the interpretation of the Mukteivara reliefs as images of divine kings, the question which remains is, "why are such images placed so prominently on this particular temple?" Nothing has been mentioned so far as to who exactly the kings depicted on the Muktesvara temple might be. With a date of ca. 950-975, based primarily on stylistic considerations and comparisons with roughly datable temples like the Parasurimeivara (ca. 635-650), Vaital Deul (ca. 8oo), and Brahmeivara (ca. 1o5o), the Mukteivara was built during the first century of the "later" Somavamfi dynasty, which most likely reigned either from ca. 882-IIIO54 or from ca. 929-1118.55 By around the middle of the tenth century, the Somavamris (literally, "whose lineage is from Soma," the moon, but also one of the lokapdlas) appear to have become firmly established on coastal Orissa.56 According to Orissan tradition,57 the Muktesvara temple was built by Yayati I Mahisivagupta, the second Somavamri king, who probably ruled either from ca. 922-95 5, or as late as ca. 963-991.5' The tradition seems authentic, since Yayati's dates correspond closely to the date of the temple, arrived at through stylistic analysis. The site of Bhubaneswar, near the eastern coast, had been a pilgrimage site sacred to Siva from at least the early seventh century.59 It is possible that Yayaiti built the small but elaborate Mukteivara temple as a symbol, not only of the dynasty's growing supremacy, but of the divine legitimacy of its royal power as well. Hermann Kulke discusses how royal patronage at pilgrimage sites "had great significance for the legitimation of royal power... The tirthas (places of pilgrimage) became centers of a multicentered royal network which united the different nuclear areas religiously and even economically."-6 And so, even though Bhubaneswar was not their political capital, the Somavamfis' declaration of affiliation with Siva at this important pilgrimage site and religious center was crucial to their establishment of divine legitimacy. As examples of this "royal temple policy," Kulke cites, among others, the Brhad-ivara temple at Tanjore (eleventh century), the Kandariya Mahadeva at Khajuraho (eleventh century), the Lifigardja at Bhubaneswar (eleventh century), and the Jagannitha temple at Puri (twelfth century).61 As "royal temples," these works are most notable for their extreme monumentality, in contrast to the tenth-century Muktesvara temple, which is of the same modest proportion as most of its predecessors, being built at a time before the trend toward grandiose size became established. In spite of this, the Mukteivara fits well into Kulke's scheme in that it was built after a long hiatus of architectural activity in Bhubaneswar, the Mukteivara's immediate predecessors being the Vaital Deul and Sifiresvara temples, both dating to ca. 8oo, and possibly sponsored by the Somavamfis' predecessors, the early kings of the Bhauma Kara dynasty (ca. 736-923). Most politically powerful during their first century, the dynasty began a decline that steadily increased during the first quarter of the ninth century.62 The Muktesvara temple, then, was possibly built as a declaration of Somavamsi legitimacy as the Bhauma Karas' successors, showing the dynasty's kings (Yayati himself, and/or his predeces- sors?) literally at the center of a newly formed royal cult dedicated to Siva. The reliefs on the candraidlds of the Muktesvara temple, placed in close proximity to a symbolic and visually powerful representation of Siva, give form to the idea of the king as a deputy of the supreme lord, who himself 54 K.

Sarma's chronology, while based on amore critical assessment of various records than Panigrahi's-particularly those of dynasties like the Kalacuris and Colas, with whom the Somavamsis were in conflict-fails to relate the probable beginning of the previous Bhauma Kara dynasty (736 A.D.) to her chronological sequence (Sarma, ibid., p. 15), which would give the Somavams1 dynasty an earlier beginning than she allows. 56 N.

If such a cult existed, it strongly parallels the cult of Jagannatha (which is much more clearly documented and observable, due mainly to the fact that it is a living tradition), and was an important precedent for it. 106</page></plain_text>
