On showing these to the smith with whom I was apprenticed, he peered at the photos and appeared to recognize something familiar in what he saw. "Ahhh!" he said looking at a black and white cow mask, "imina na" (ox mask), and similarly of a rabbit mask, "imina ?on" (hare mask). One image of a masked female sitting in a tent caused confusion at first, until I explained that her home was portable. "Ah yes . . . imina pulloyana" (Fulani woman mask) he said at once with conviction. . . . On a later field trip to the Dogon region I took with me an assortment of plastic character masks that I'd carefully selected from a local novelty store. After some thought, my final choice consisted of a lurid rendition of "Bugs Bunny/' a devil mask, and "Eh-Oh," a character from the children's show "Teletubbies" (complete with a triangular superstructure above his head). Perhaps, I thought, one of these would also strike a familiar chord and might even be danced at the next Dogon funerary rite. But no. Instead, my purchases provoked only hilarity from my Dogon friends: "These are not real masks . . . these are just games for children/ they retorted, and the objects in question were quickly cast off to a gang of young boys who put them on and promptly rampaged through the village with glee. So if these weren't "real" masks, then what kind of reality I thought did Dogon masks in fact present?
