<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEROES OF SUMER A New Heroic Age in World History and Literature SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER Associate Curator in the Babylonian Section, University Museum, University of Pennsylvania (Read April 20, 1946) FROM time to time in the course of the history of civilization, and from place to place, we come upon a social phenomenon known as the Heroic Age. To take only three of the more ancient and better known examples, there is the Teu- tonic Heroic Age which dominated much of northern Europe from the fourth to the sixth century A.D., the Greek Heroic Age which flour- ished on the mainland of Greece toward the very end of the second millennium B.C., and finally the Heroic Age of India which probably dates only a century or so later than that of Greece.' All three heroic ages reveal a marked and signi- ficant resemblance in social structure, govern- mental organization, religious concepts, and aesthetic expression; it is obvious that they owe their origin and being to very similar social, political, and psychic factors. The Sumerian poem, whose extant text is made available for the first time in the present study, is one of a group of heroic narrative poems which will intro- duce a new Heroic Age, that of the Sumerians, to world history and literature. Although it probably had its floruit no later than the first quarter of the third millennium B.C., and there- fore precedes by more than a millennium and a half even the oldest of the three Indo-European Heroic Ages, that of the Greeks, it follows with remarkable closeness the culture pattern typical for those lonLr known epochs.2 The Greek, Indian, and Teutonic Heroic Ages, to judge from the relevant literary records, are essentially barbaric periods which show a number of salient characteristics in common. The politi- cal unit consists of a petty kingdom ruled by a king or prince who obtains and holds his rule through military prowess. His mainstay in power consists of the comitatus, a retinue of armed, loyal followers, who are prepared to do his bidding without question, no matter how foolhardy and dangerous the undertaking. There may, be an assembly, but it is convened at the ruler's pleasure and serves only in an advisory and confirmatory capacity. The ruling kings and princes of the separate principalities carry on among themselves a lively and at times friendly and even intimate intercourse; they thus tend to develop into what may be termed an international aristocratic caste whose thoughts and acts have little in common with those of their subjects. On the religious side we find our three Indo-European Heroic Ages characterized by a worship of anthropomorphic deities which to a large extent seem to be rec- ognized everywhere throughout the various states and principalities. These gods form or- ganized communities in a specially chosen local- ity, though in addition each god has a special abode of his own. There are few traces of chthonic or spirit worship; at death the soul travels to some distant locality which is con- ceived as a universal home and is not reserved for members of any particular community.3 Some of the heroes are conceived as springing from the gods, but there is no trace of heroic worship or hero cults. All these features com- mon to the Heroic Ages of Greece, India, and Northern Europe, are shared by that of Sumer, as the sketch of the contents of the Sumerian epic material about to follow, will reveal. But the parallelism between our four Heroic 1 The statements and summations concerning the Greek, Indian, and Teutonic Heroic Ages here presented are based primarily on the analyses and conclusions of H. Munro Chadwick in his The Heroic Age (Cambridge, 1912), and of H. Munro and N. Kershaw Chadwick, in their monumental three-volume work, The growth of literature (Cambridge, 1932-1940). For the Heroic Age of India, cf. N. K. Sidhanta's The Heroic Age of India (London, 1929). It is no insignificant index of the value and reli- ability of these works to note their effective utilization to give meaning and form to an hitherto practically unknown cultural stage in the history of ancient Mesopotamia. 2 The implications of the uncovering of the existence of a flourishing Sumerian Heroic Age for the archaeology and history of southern Mesopotamia will be discussed in special study now in preparation, "A new Heroic Age and its archaeological implications." 3 Note however that in the matter of the heroic con- ception of an after-life, the notion of a warrior's paradise is characteristic of the Teutonic and Indian peoples, but not of the Sumerians, nor of the Homeric Greeks. PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 90, NO. 2, MAY, 1946 120</page><page sequence="2">HEROES OF SUMER 121 Ages extends even further; indeed it is particu- larly instructive and revealing on the aesthetic plane, especially in the field of literature. For one of the more notable achievements of all four of our Heroic Ages consisted of the creation of an oral group of heroic narrative tales in poetic form which reflect and illuminate the spirit of the age and its temper. Impelled by the thirst for fame and name so characteristic of the ruling caste during the Heroic Age, the bards and minstrels attached to the court were moved to improvise and compose narrative poems or lays celebrating the adventures and achievements of those kings and princes whose experiences lent themselves to imaginative and sympathetic treatment; these epic lays whose object was primarily to provide entertainment at the frequent courtly banquets and feasts were recited no doubt to the accompaniment of the harp, lyre, or lute. Now, obviously enough, none of these early heroic lays have come down to us in their original form, since their first composition took place during the Heroic Age itself, when writing was either altogether unknown, or, if known, was of little concern to the illiterate minstrel. The written epics relating to the Greek, Indian, and Teu- tonic Heroic Ages, as we have them, date of course from much later days, and consist of highly complex literary redactions in which only a selected number of the earlier lays are im- bedded, and these in a highly modified and ex- panded form. In Sumer there is good reason to believe that at least some of the early heroic lays were first inscribed on clay some five to six hundred years following the close of the Heroic Age, and then only after they had undergone very considerable transformation at the hands of the priests and scribes.4 However, it is to be carefully noted that the copies of the epic texts which we actually have at present date almost entirely from the first half of the second millen- nium B.C.5 Now, as is well known, the written epics relat- ing to the three Indo-European Heroic Ages show a number of striking similarities in form and content. In the first place, the poems are all concerned primarily with individuals; it is the deeds and exploits of the individual hero which are the prime concern of the poet, not the fate or glory of the state or the community. More- over, while there is little doubt that some of the experiences and adventures celebrated in the poems have a historical basis, the poet does not hesitate to introduce everywhere certain un- historical motifs and conventions, such as ex- aggerated notions of the hero's powers, ominous dreams, and the presence of divine beings. Stylistically the epic poems are found to abound in static epithets, lengthy repetitions, and re- current formulas, while certain types of descrip- tions tend to be over-leisurely and unusually detailed. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that all the epics devote very considerable space to speeches. In all these respects the Sumerian heroic poetry follows closely the pattern of the Greek, Indian, and Teutonic epic material.6 And since it is hardly likely that a literary genre so individual in style and technique as narrative poetry was created and developed independently and at different time intervals in Sumer, Greece, India, and Northern Europe, and since that of the Sumerians is by all odds the oldest of the four, it is perhaps not unreasonable to conclude that it is in Sumer that we may look for the origin of epic poetry as a whole.7 4 For the indications that there was considerable Sum- erian written literature in existence in the second half of the third millennium B.C., cf. my Sumerian mythology (Mem. Amer. Philos. Soc. 21: 18-19, 1944). I That is, if we use the new low chronology of Smith and Albright, cf. Bull. Amer. Schools Orient. Res. 88: 28 ff., 1942, and Amer. Jour. Arch. 49: 18 ff., 1945. 6 Of the more outstanding differences between the Sumerian epic material and that of the Greeks, Indians, and Teutons, we may note the following: (a) The Sumerian epic poems revolving about a given hero consist of individ- ual, disconnected tales of varying length, each of which is restricted to a single episode; there is no attempt to articulate and integrate these episodes into a larger epic unit. This was first achieved by the Accadian poets, particularly in their epic of Gilgamesh, who borrowed, modified, and molded the relatively brief and episodic Sumerian sources; of. "The epic of Gilgamesh and its Sumerian sources," in the Jour. Amer. Orient. Soc. 64: 7-23, 1944. (b) There is relatively little characterization and psychological penetration in the Sumerian material; the heroes tend to be broad and more or less undifferenti- ated types, rather than highly personalized individuals. Moreover the incidents and plot motifs are related in a rather static and highly conventional style; there is little of that expressive, plastic movement which characterizes such poems as the Iliad and Odyssey. (c) Women play no role in the Sumerian epic material, while they have a very prominent part in the Indo-European epics. (d) In the matter of technique the Sumerian poets depend for their rhythmic effect solely on the variations in the repetition patterns; they make no use of meter or uniform line which is so characteristic of the Indo-European epics. 7 It is very interesting to note that one of the two authors of The growth of literature (ef. note 1) had already come to the conclusion that Mesopotamia was the birthplace of narrative or epic poetry and that it had spread from there in different directions; cf. vol. III: 725, note 2. The paper there promised in support of this thesis has, as far as I</page><page sequence="3">122 SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER Let us turn now to the contents of the extant Sumerian epic poems. At present we can iden- tify nine epic tales varying in length from a little over one hundred to very probably more than five hundred lines. Two of these revolve about the hero Enmerkar; two about the hero Lugal- banda, although in one of these Enmerkar, too, plays a considerable role; five center about the most famous of the three heroes, Gilgamesh. All three are known from the Sumerian king list, a document which like our epic material has been found inscribed on tablets dating from the first half of the second millennium B.C. and which again, as in the case of our epic material, was probably composed in the last quarter of the third millennium B.C.8 Here, that is in the king list, they are stated to be the second, third, and fifth rulers of the first dynasty of Erech which, according to the Sumerian scribes, followed the first dynasty of Kish which in turn followed immediately upon the flood. But, although all three of our heroes are listed in the same dynasty, all our evidence seems to point to the conclusion that they were actually unrelated to each other.9 The first of the two Enmerkar epic tales, to judge from the available texts, probably con- sisted of over five hundred lines; at present, how- ever, only slightly over four hundred can be accounted for, and of these less than two hun- dred are well preserved.10 Obviously, therefore, the following sketch of its contents is quite tentative in character, to be filled out and cor- rected as new material is uncovered. The action of the poem centers about Enmerkar's successful efforts to obtain submission and allegiance from a "lord" of Aratta1l who remains unnamed throughout the poem. To achieve his end, Enmerkar wins the favor of the great god Enki with the promise that, if Aratta submits to Erech, he will have the inhabitants of Aratta transport stones from the mountains to build a great shrine for him, and that in numerous other ways he will exalt the god, his shrines, and his decrees. He then dispatches a herald to the "lord" of Aratta with instructions to prevail upon him to recognize Enmerkar as his overlord; this he is to achieve by extolling the latter as the favorite of Enki, and particularly by reciting to him the "spell" of Enki.12 The herald, after a long journey involving the crossing of the seven mountains, finally arrives at Aratta, and, as instructed, repeats Enmerkar's demands to its "lord." The latter at first refuses since such action would result in a loss of prestige for his goddess Inanna whose protege he seems to be. But the herald overcomes his reluctance with the promise that his patron deity Inanna will be made queen of the temple Eanna in Erecb. Whereupon the "lord" of Aratta is ready to yield. This is not the end of the poem, however. After a considerable break in the text we find the "lord" of Aratta addressing his own herald and instructing him to go to Enmerkar and invite him to visit Aratta. For before actually bowing down to Enmerkar as his overlord, he would first meet him face to face that they might debate the issue between them. And so En- merkar starts on the long journey, accompanied by a considerable retinue. Before his actual arrival, however, Enmerkar once again dis- patches his herald to the "lord" of Aratta with a message which seems to consist of a eulogy of his (Enmerkar's) scepter and rule. The herald returns from Aratta with a reply whose import is obscure. Here the text breaks off altogether, with the end of the poem not yet in sight. The second Enmerkar tale is also concerned with the submission of a "lord" of Aratta to Enmerkar.13 However, in this poem it is not Enmerkar who makes the first demands on his rival, the "lord" of Aratta, but rather the latter who first issues the challenge which leads to his own discomfiture. Moreover, since throughout our second Enmerkar poem the "lord" of Aratta is referred to by his actual namne, Ensukushsir- anna, it is not quite certain whether he is to be identified with the "lord" of Aratta who remains unnamed throughout the first Ennierkar poem. As for the available contents of this second Enmerkar tale-at present we have only ap- proximately one hundred well preserved lines at the very beginning of the poem, and very probably some twenty-five well-preserved lines toward the end-thev run as follows: know, not yet appeared; it probably rests largely on the significant fact that the Accadian epic of Gilgamesh (cf. under (a) in the preceding note) was current all over the Near East in the second millennium B.C. Needless to say, the Sumerian epic material now being made available to the scholar tends to confirm the correctness of this view. 8 Cf. SS (= Supplementary Study of the Bull. Amer.

SS No. 3, note 3i.</page><page sequence="4">HEROES OF SUMER 123 Ensukushsiranna, the "lord" of Aratta, having decided to issue a challenge to Enmerkar, the lord of Erech and Kullab, dispatched a herald to him with a demand that the latter submit to his overlordship and "carry the basket for him." If he does so, the herald is to continue-the riddle-like phrases are largely obscure-he will be allowed to dwell with the goddess Inanna and lie with her on a fruitful couch; also he may eat of the kurku-bird with the other ishakku's who have recognized Ensukushsiranna as suzerain. The herald delivers his message to Enmerkar who promptly returns the challenge and contemptu- ously rejects the promised rewards. Upon hear- ing this, Ensukushsiranna gathers his council and informs them of Enmerkar's insolent atti- tude. The rest of the poem is practically en- tirely destroyed except probably for the very end of the poem where, for some unknown reason, Ensukushsiranna is only too ready to take second place to Enmerkar whom he extolls as the beloved of Inanna and as a great lord who knows no rival. We turn now to the two epic tales in which the hero Lugalbanda plays the leading role. The first, which may be entitled "Lugalbanda and Enmerkar," is a poem of more than four hundred lines, the great majority of which are excellently preserved.14 Nevertheless, in spite of the rela- tively few breaks in the text, the sense of many passages is far from clear, and the following sketch of the more intelligible parts of its con- tents, based on numerous repeated efforts in the course of the past several years to get at the meaning of the poem, must still be considered highly tentative in character. Lugalbanda, perhaps because he has set his heart on journey- ing to the far-distant city Aratta, is determined first to win the friendship of the Zu-bird who decrees the fates and utters the word which none may transgress. While the Zu-bird is away, therefore, he goes to his nest and presents his young with fat, honey, and bread, paints their faces, and places the shugurra crown upon their heads. The Zu-bird, upon returning to his nest, is most gratified with this god-like treatment of his young, and proclaims himself as ready to bestow friendship and favor upon whatever god or man had done this gracious deed. Where- upon Lugalbanda steps up to receive his reward. Accordingly, the Zu-bird, in a highly eulogistic passage replete with blessings, bids him go head high probably to Aratta. Upon Lugalbanda's request, he decrees for him a favorable journey, and adds some pertinent advice which he is to repeat to no one, not even his closest followers. The Zu-bird now reenters his nest, while Lugal- banda returns to his friends and informs them of his imminent journey. They try to dissuade him; it is a journey from which none return since it involves the crossing of high mountains as well as the dreaded river of Kur. However, Lugal- banda is adamant, and eagerly awaits his op- portunity. Now in Erech, Lugalbanda's lord, Enmerkar, the son of the sun-god, Utu, is in great distress. For many years past the Semitic Martu have been ravaging both Sumer and Accad. Now they are laying siege to Erech itself. Enmerkar finds that he must get through a call for help to his sister, the goddess Inanna of Aratta. But try as he will, he can find no one to undertake the dangerous journey to Aratta to deliver his message. This, then, seems to be Lugalbanda's moment. He steps up to his king and bravely volunteers for the task; moreover upon Enmerkar's insistence, he swears that he will make the journey all alone, unaccompanied by any of his followers. After receiving from Enmerkar the exact words of his message to Inanna of Aratta, Lugalbanda hastens to his friends and followers and informs them of his imminent journey. Again they try to dissuade him, but to no avail. He takes up his weapons, crosses the seven mountains that reach from one end of Anshan to the other, and finally arrives with joyful step at his destination. There, in Aratta, he is given a warm welcome by Inanna. Upon her query as to what brought him all alone from Erech to Aratta, Lugalbanda repeats verbatim Enmerkar's message and call for help. Inanna's answer, which marks the end of our poem, is most obscure; it seems to involve a river and its rather unusual fish which Enmerkar is perhaps to catch; also certain water- vessels which he is to fashion, and finally workers of metal and stone whom he is to settle in his city. But just how all this will remove the threat of the Martu from Sumer and Accad, or lift the siege from Erech, is far from clear. The second Lugalbanda tale, which may be tentatively entitled "Lugalbanda and Mt. Hur- rum," probably also ran well over four hundred lines; at present, however, with both the begin- ning and end of the poem missing, we can account for some three hundred and fifty lines of text of which about half are in excellent condition.15 14 Cf. SS No. 3, note 3k. 15 Cf. SS No. 3, note 3v.</page><page sequence="5">124 SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER Its available contents, as far as they can be re- constructed from the fragmentary and difficult text, may be tentatively sketched as follows: In the course of a journey from Kullab of Erech to the far distant Aratta, Lugalbanda and his followers arrive at Mt. Hurrum. There Lugal- banda falls ill. His companions, believing that he is soon to die, decide to proceed without him, planning to pick up his dead body upon their return from Aratta, and to carry it back to Kullab. To take care of his immediate wants, however, they leave with him a considerable quantity of food, water, and strong drink, as well as his weapons. Alone, ill, and forsaken, Lugalbanda utters a prayer to the sun-god, Utu, who sees to it that his health is restored by means of the "food of life," and the "water of life." Upon regaining his health, Lugalbanda seems to wander all alone over the highland steppe, living by hunting its wild life and gather- ing its uncultivated plants. Once, falling asleep, he dreams that he is commanded, perhaps by the sun-god, Utu, to take up his weapons, hunt and kill a wild bull, and present its fat to the rising Utu; also to slaughter a kid and pour out its blood in a ditch, and its fat on the plain. Upon awaking, Lugalbanda does exactly as bidden. In addition, he prepares food and strong drink for An, Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursag, the four leading deities of the Sumerian pantheon. The approximately last hundred lines of the extant text seem to contain a eulogy of seven heavenly lights who help Nanna, the moon-god, Utu, the sun-god, and Inanna, the planet Venus, to give light to the cosmos. So much for the Enmerkar and Lugalbanda epic material now available. Turning to the most renowned of our trio, the hero Gilgamesh, we can at present identify five epic tales con- cerned with his adventures and achievements. The texts of two of these, "Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven," and "The Death of Gilga- mesh," are in a very fragmentary condition; one, "Gilgamesh and Agga of Kish," consists of one hundred and fifteen lines almost perfectly pre- served, although its text presents as yet so many difficulties to the translator that much of its meaning still eludes us; the fourth, "Gilgamesh and the Nether World," is a well preserved poem of over two hundred and fifty lines whose intro- ductory passage is particularly significant for the analysis of the Sumerian cosmogonic con- cepts; the fifth, "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living," is the epic tale whose entire available text, its first one hundred and seventy-four lines, is presented in this study."6 First, then, "Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven"; its fragmentary contents, poorly pre- served as they are, may be sketched as follows: Inanna, the goddess of love and war, the Sumer- ian counterpart of the Semitic Ishtar, makes love proposals to the hero Gilgamesh upon whom she is prepared to shower gifts and favors without stint. But Gilgamesh spurns her offers. Where- upon Inanna turns to An, the heaven god, and asks him to present her with the bull of heaven. An at first refuses, but Inanna threatens to take the matter up with all the great gods of the uni- verse. Terrified, An grants her request. In- anna then sends the bull of heaven down against Erech where it proceeds to ravage the city. From here on, the available text which concludes with an address by Enkidu, Gilgamesh's loyal follower and constant companion, to Gilgamesh, becomes unintelligible. The end of the poem, which described no doubt Gilgamesh's victorious struggle with the bull of heaven, is missing alto- gether. From the meager extant portion of our second Gilgamesh tale, "The Death of Gilgamesh," only the following contents are recognizable. Gilga- mesh, who is seeking immortality, is informed that eternal life is not for him; kingship, promin- ence, heroism in battle-all these have been decreed for him, but not immortality. Follows the death of Gilgamesh and a long poetic des- cription of the ensuing mourning. After a break of unknown size, we find that Gilgamesh's spirit has probably descended to the nether world to become its king. Here he first presents gifts and offerings to the numerous deities and priests of the nether world for his family and retinue- his wives, children, musicians, chief valet, and attendants. Our poem concludes with a special tribute to the glory and memorv of Gilgamesh. Our third Gilgamesh epic tale, "Gilgamesh and Agga of Kish," with its small but well-nigh perfectly preserved text, is of no little historical and political interest; its contents run approxi- mately as follows: Agga, king of Kish, who ac- cording to our poem had at one time been a 16 For the scientific edition of this text, including auto- graph copies of the unpublished material, transliteration, and commentary, cf. the forthcoming SS No. 3.

Orient. Soc. 64: 7-23, 1944.</page><page sequence="6">HEROES OF SUMER 125 satellite of Gilgamesh, has now become powerful enough to demand that Erech become subservi- ent to Kish. He therefore sends heralds to Gilgamesh with words to that effect. The latter gathers a council of the elders of Erech who, at the urging of Gilgamesh, commit themselves to take up arms rather than to submit to "the house of Kish." Not yet satisfied, Gilgamesh convokes a second council, this time of all the fighting men of Erech, and repeats his entreaties not to submit to "the house of Kish." This council, too, solemnly resolves to fight rather than yield; moreover it pronounces Gilgamesh as the king and hero of their city. In spite of their brave words and heroic resolutions, how- ever, the people of Erech are terrified by the thought of Agga's approach. Only Gilgamesh, though sadly troubled by the rather cowardly reactions of the Erechites, remains confident; he ends up an address to his faithful follower Enkidu with the lines: When he (Agga) shall have come, my great fear will overwhelm him, His judgment will be confounded, his counsel will be dissipated. In a very short time, however, Agga seems to have succeeded in seizing the outskirts of the city, and the Erechites were dumbfounded. Gilgamesh then addresses the heroes of Erech, and asks for a volunteer to go before Agga. He finds one in Birhurturri who seems convinced that he can confound the judgment and counsel of the king of Kish. No sooner does Birhurturri pass through the gate, however, than he seems to be seized, beaten, and brought before Agga. He begins to address Agga, but, before he has finished, another hero-his name is only partly preserved-ascends the walls of Erech, perhaps to observe what is going on. Follows a conversa- tion between Agga and Birhurturri whose mean- ing it is as yet impossible to penetrate although the text is in perfect condition. It is reasonably clear, however, that Birhurturri fails to come to terms with Agga, and once again he is beaten by Agga's men. Gilgamesh himself then as- cends the walls of Erech. The Erechites, young and old, are now overcome with fright, while the fighting men clutch their weapons. Whereupon Enkidu goes out through the gate and seems to persuade Agga to withdraw his forces and leave Erech in peace. Gilgamesh then thanks Agga whom he describes as his "overseer," "super- visor," and "captain of the host," for sparing his life. Moreover he pronounces Agga as the king and hero of Erech in the identical words which the Erechite council had used when honoring Gilgamesh with the very same titles. Our fourth Gilgamesh poem begins with what may be described as an introduction of twenty- seven lines whose contents have nothing to do with the story of the poem; their cosmogonic contents merely serve as a preface to it. The story itself runs as follows: Once upon a time a huluppu-tree, perhaps a willow, planted on the bank of the Euphrates and nurtured by its waters, was attacked violently by the South Wind and flooded by the waters of the Euphra- tes. The goddess Inanna, walking by, takes the tree in her hand and brings it to her city Erech where she plants it in her holy garden. There she tends it most carefully. For, when the tree grows big, she plans to make of its wood a chair for herself and a couch. Years pass; the tree matures and grows big. But Inanna finds herself unable to cut down the tree. For at its base the snake who "knows no charm" has built its nest. In its crown the Zu- bird has placed its young. In its middle Lilith has built her house. And so Inanna, the light- hearted and ever joyful maid, sheds bitter tears. As the dawn breaks, and her brother, the sun- god Utu, comes forth from his sleeping chamber, she repeats to him tearfully all that has befallen her huluppu-tree. Thereupon Gilgamesh chiv- alrously comes to her aid. He dons his armor weighing fifty minas, and with his ax of the road, seven talents and seven minas in weight, he slays the snake who "knows no charm" at the base of the tree. Seeing which, the Zu-bird flees with its young to the mountain, while Lilith tears down her house and flees to the desolate places. Gilgamesh and the men of Erech who accompanied him now cut down the tree and give it to Inanna for her chair and couch. Either Gilgamesh or Inanna then fashions of the base of the tree a pukku, probably a "drum," and of its crown, a mikku, probably a "drumstick." Fol- lows a passage of twelve lines which describes Gilgamesh's activity in Erech with this pukku and mikku, with this "drum" and "drumstick." Despite the fact that the text is in perfect con- dition, it is still impossible to penetrate its mean- ing. It is not impossible, however, that it describes in some detail certain overbearing and tyrranical acts which brought woe to the in- habitants of Erech. When the story becomes intelligible once again, it continues with the</page><page sequence="7">126 SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER statement that, "because of the outcry of the young maidens," the pukku and the mikku fell into the nether world. Gilgamesh puts in his hand as well as his foot to retrieve them, but is unable to reach them. And so he seats himself at the gate of the nether world and laments: "O my pukku, 0 my mikku, My pukku whose lutstiness was irresistable, My mikku whose pulsations cozuld not be drowned ouit, In those days whent verily my pukku was with me in the house of the carpenter, (When) verily the wife of the carpenter was with me like the mother who gave birth to me, (When) verily the daughter of the carpenter was with me like my younger sister, My pukku, who will bring it up from the nether world, My mikku, who will bring it up from the 'face' of the nether world?" His servant Enkidu thereupon volunteers to descend to the nether world and bring them up for him, saying: "O my master, why dost thou cry, why is they heart sick? Thy pukku, lo, I will now bring it up from the nether world, Thy mikku, I will bring it up from the 'face' of the nether world." Hearing his servant's generous offer, Gilga- mesh warns him of a number of the nether world tabus which he is to guard against; the passage reads: Gilgamesh says to Enkidu: "If now thou wilt descend to the nether world, A word I speak to thee, take my word, Instruction I offer thee, take my instruction. Do not put on clean clothes, Lest like an enemy they will mark thee; Do not anoint thyself with the good oil of the burnt- vessel, Lest at its smell they will crowd about thee. Do not throw the throw-stick in the nether world, Lest they who were struck by the throw-stick will surround thee; Do not carry a staff in thy hand, Lest the shades will flutter all about thee. Do not put sandals on thy feet, In the nether world make no cry; Kiss not thy beloved wife, Strike not thy hated wife, Kiss not thy beloved son, Strike not thy hated son. Lest the outcry of Kur will seize thee; (The outcry) to her who is lying, to her who is lying, To the mother of Ninazu who is lying, Whose holy body no garment covers, WVhose holy breast no cloth wraps." But Enkidu heeds not the instructions of his master and commits all those very acts against which Gilgamesh has warned him. And so he is seized by Kur and is unable to reascend to the earth. Thereupon Gilgamesh proceeds to Nip- pur and weeps before Enlil: "O father Enlil, my pukku fell into the nether world, My mikku fell into the 'face' of the nether world; I sent Enkidu to bring them up, Kur has seized him. Namtar has not seized him, Asig has not seized him, Kur has seized him. Nergal's ambusher, who spares no one, has not seized him, Kur has seized him. In battle, the place of manliness, he has not fallen, Kur has seized him." But Enlil refuses to stand by Gilgamesh who then proceeds to Eridu and repeats his plea before Enki. The latter orders the sun-god, Utu, to open a hole in the nether world and to allow the shade of Enkidu to ascend to the earth. Utu does as bidden, and the shade of Enkidu appears before Gilgamesh. Master and servant embrace, and Gilgamesh questions Enkidu about what he saw in the nether world. The first seven questions concern the treatment in the nether world of those who were fathers of from one to seven sons respectively. The remaining text of our poem is poorly preserved, but we still have parts of the Gilgamesh-Enkidu col- loquyT concerning the treatment in the nether world of the palace servant, of the birth-giving woman, of him who falls in battle, of him whose shade has no one to care for it, and of him whose body lies unburied in the plain. Turning now to the fifth and last of our Gilga- mesh poems, the one whose full available text is about to follow, we find its contents to run as follows: The "lord" Gilgamesh, realizing that, like all mortals, he too must die sooner or later, is determined at least to raise up a name for him- self before he meets his destined end. He there- fore sets his heart on journeying to the far dis- tant land of the living, also known as a cedar land, with the probable intention of felling its cedars and bringing them to Erech. He in- forms his servant Enkidu of his proposed under- taking, and the latter advises him first to ac-</page><page sequence="8">HEROES OF SUMER 127 quaint the sun-god, Utu, with his plan, for it is Utu who has charge of the cedar land. Acting upon his advice, Gilgamesh brings offerings to Utu and pleads for his support of the contem- plated journey to the land of the living. Utu at first seems rather skeptical of Gilgamesh's qualifications. But Gilgamesh only repeats his plea in more persuasive language. Utu takes pity on him and decides to help him probably by immobilizing in some way the seven vicious demons personifying those destructive weather phenomena that might menace Gilgamesh in the course of his journey across the mountains situated between Erech and the land of the living. Overjoyed, Gilgamesh gathers fifty volunteers from Erech, unattached men who have neither "house" nor "mother" and who are ready to follow him wherever he goes and to do whatever he does. After having weapons of bronze and wood prepared for himself and his companions, they cross with the help of Utu the seven moun- tains lying between Erech and the land of the living. Just what happens immediately upon crossing the last of the seven mountains is not clear since the relevant passage is poorly pre- served. When the text becomes intelligible again, we find that Gilgamesh has fallen into a heavy sleep from which he is awakened only after considerable time and effort. Thoroughly aroused by this unexpected delay he swears by his mother Ninsun and by his father Lugalbanda that he will enter the land of the living and brook no interference from its guardian, be he man or god. Enkidu pleads with him to turn back, for it is Huwawa who guards the cedars, a monster whose destructive attack none may withstand. But Gilgamesh will have none of this caution. Convinced that with Enkidu's help no harm will fall to either of them, he bids him put away fear and go forward with him. Spying from his cedar house, however, is the monster Huwawa who seems to make frantic but vain efforts to drive off Gilgamesh and his adventurous band. Following a break of some lines, we learn that after cutting down seven trees Gilgamesh had probably come to Huwawa's inner chamber. Strangely enough, at the very first, and seemingly very light, attack on the part of Gilgamesh, Huwawa is overcome with fright, and begs for mercy and protection. Gilgamesh would like to act the generous victor, and in riddle-like phrases suggests to Enkidu that Huwawa be set free. But Enkidu, fearful of the consequences, advises against such unwise action. Following Hu- wawa s indignant criticism of Enkidu's ungener- ous attitude, our two heroes seem to bring Hu- wawa before the great gods Enlil and Ninlil. So ends the extant portion of our poem, con- sisting of one hundred and seventy-four lines. At the moment there is no way of judging its full length, but it may well have run on for several hundred lines more. The preceding paragraph sketches the plot and action of our epic tale "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living," in prosaic and literal lan- guage which utterly fails to convey those quali- ties and characteristics that mark this composi- tion as one of the finest of Sumerian poetic creations. It will, therefore, be advisable to present a brief summation of our poem's aesthetic relevance. In the first place, its motivating theme, man's anxiety about death and its sub- limation in the notion of an immortal name, has a universal significance which lends it high poetic coloring. On the technical side, our poet makes use of uncommonly varied groups of repetition and parallelism patterns whose total rhythmic effect is in full consonance with the poignant mood of the poem's theme. Similarly, from the point of view of content and substance, the poet is careful to select those essential details of the underlying incidents and ideas whose composite effect is to create the heroic tone and super- human atmosphere which characterize our epic tale. It is this superb blending of its three fundamental ingredients, the significant motivat- ing theme, the effective rhythmic technique, and the imaginative selection of contextual detail, which stamps our composition as a great poem, one which must have made a profound emo- tional and aesthetic appeal to its credulous and highly sympathetic audience. Indeed, even the modern reader whose mind and temper can no longer accept the rather immature ideas and child-like concepts underlying the far-fetched and incredible episodes, will not remain wholly unmoved by this epic tale, which, like all true poetry, consists essentially of rhythmic language that stirs the imagination. Following, then, is a literal rendering of the available text of the poem "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living" :17 17 Italics indicate doubtful translations. Words be- tween parentheses are not in the Sumerian text but are added- for purposes of clarification. Words between brackets are broken away and lost from the original, and are supplied by the author. Words between quotation marks represent literal translations of Sumerian words whose fuller implications are too uncertain to permit a more idiomatic rendering.</page><page sequence="9">128 SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER The lord, toward the land of the living set his mind, The lord Gilgamesh, toward the land of the living set his mind, He says to his servant Enkidu: "O Enkidu, not yet have the brick and stamp brought forth the fated end; I would enter the 'land,' I would set up my name, In its places where the names (of the gods) have been raised up, I would raise up my name, In its places where the names have not been raised up, I would raise up the names of the gods.
