<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jack Spicer's Poetry of Absence: An Introduction "Poor bastards, trying to get through hell in a hurry." Pray for them bastards who are not patient enough to listen. The flying leaves of a moving tree, a bleeding tree. In a crowd of imaginary images.... They go through life till the next morning. As we all do. But constantly. As if the shimmering before them were not hell but the reach of something. - "A Textbook of Poetry" The poetry of Jack Spicer is virtually unknown in the academic community. This, no doubt, is partially because he and, after his death in 1965, those he influenced on the West Coast guarded it jealously from contamination by the literary establishment. But there is another and, from my point of view, more significant and telling reason for this neglect. Spicer's poetry emerged at a time when the prevailing academic interpretive and critical theory of closure precluded understanding of his post-Modern poetics of dis-closure. With the emergence in the 1970's of a phenomenology of absence and a literary thinking that appropriates the anti-metaphysical or anti-logocentric formal and rhetorical imperatives of Heidegger, of Merleau-Ponty, of Jacques Derrida, Jack Spicer's non-sense has begun not only to make sense, but to assume considerable importance in America. This, I think, explains the timely publication of Spicer's Collected Books by Black Sparrow Press (1975) and the important essay by his literary executor and editor, Robin Blaser, "The Practice of Outside," which locates the poetry in the context of this thinking about language. It also explains this special issue of boundary 2. The postmodernism of Jack Spicer's poetry is a complex phenomenon, not easily defined or categorized. It should, for example, be ultimately distinguished from, say, Charles Olson's or Robert Creeley's in that he commits language to the freeplay of writing (somewhat in the manner of Derrida's notion of dcriture), whereas Olson and Creeley commit language to the occasion of oral expression (in the manner of Heidegger's understanding of Rede). But Spicer's poetry shares with Olson's and Creeley's the essential impulse of the postmodern imagination: to call into question the metaphysical or logocentric forms that have dominated the poetry - and above all the hermeneutics - of the Western literary tradition from Sophocles to Yeats and Eliot, from Aristotle to Brooks and Wimsatt and, even more recently, the Structuralists. More specifically, Spicer's poetry of dictation, the poetry that, as Blaser puts it, is "received" by way of the generous "practice of outside," A</page><page sequence="2">gg', po: : - -:- :: . .... :Iq . . . .. .. . . A KS SI E</page><page sequence="3">is postmodern in the sense that it deconstructs the coercive rhetoric of the ego-centrism, the anthropomorphism, of the Western tradition. And he does this, as Blaser observes, in order to bring near "something other than ourselves" - the "being," perhaps, that an egocentric language closes off, hardens, and alienates in the name, on the author-ity, of the abiding logos, the Word as presence. "A reopened language," Blaser continues, "lets the unknown, the Other, the outside in again as a voice in the language. Thus, the reversal is not a reduction, but an openness. The safety of a closed language is gone and its tendency to reduce thought to a reasonableness and definiteness is disturbed." In Spicer's characteristically pop-art version of this phenomenological rhetoric, his "Martian" poetry brings the traditional - the transcendental and thus distanced - logos low, i.e., allows it to come into the region of immediacy as the "low-ghost," in order, as Michael Davidson says, to " 'spook' words into new contexts for which the [traditional] criteria of truthfulness [are] not at issue." The contemporary impulse to dis-cover or dis-close what a logocentric rhetoric of presence - a coercive naming, as it were - covers over or closes off and forgets, this impulse to reactivate the astonishment of original perception, reminds us, of course, of the anti-nomianism that, according to Roy Harvey Pearce, constitutes the forgotten origins of the American poetic tradition in poets like Walt Whitman. In so doing, it also suggests that Spicer's "received" poetry of dictation, like Heidegger's "destructive" project, in which, paradoxically, the es gibt becomes primal, constitutes a repetition, a retrieval of "our historical-spiritual existence, in order to transform it into a new beginning.. . with all the strangeness, darkness, insecurity that attend a true beginning." In this antinomian effort at retrieval of beginnings - and despite his tendency towards a neo-Gnosticism - Spicer takes a significant, if not identical, place in the post-Modern project initiated by Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and continued by Olson, Creeley, Duncan, Snyder, Rothenberg, Antin, and others to "make it new" - to re-new the tradition, i.e., open up new possibilities, by remembering origins. In keeping with their content, these prefatorial remarks are not intended as a vicious re-view of the essays gathered in this special issue on Jack Spicer's poetry. Despite the fact that this introduction was the last to be written, it is intended precisely as a pre-face. The essays themselves, I think it will be seen, play freely around it, always interrogating its assertions. As such it is part of a whole that intends not to inform but to interest where Spicer's poetry is unknown. It is, "finally," a matter of the hermeneutic - the "open" - circle. W. V.
