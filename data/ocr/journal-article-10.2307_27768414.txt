In fact, these sites have been heavily exploited for shell mining pur poses from the first european coastal settlements until very recently, as the lime from the shells have been used for building purposes and to pave road ways, and many sites are known to have been throughly destroyed. Most of the colonial occupation has been developed along the extense oceanic fa?ade of the country, where big towns as Salvador and Rio de Janeiro have ex panded in areas formerly occupied by the sambaquis. In fact, many of them have disappeared without leaving any trace (Figure 2).1 For a quick description, these sites consist of shellmounds of various sizes, from small two-meter high heaps or shell-covered sandy dunes to four hun dred meters long and thirty meters high, overwhelmingly impressive mounds containing stone and bone artifacts, hearths and burials, disposed in a rather complex sequence of layers with quite different composition and thickness (Figure 3). In fact, sites larger than two thousand cubic meters are known in the southern shores, where their monumental characteristics make them im portant visual references through the open coastal landscape (Figure 4).These sites display a tendency to aggregate around bay and lagunar ecotones, and are related to a late Archaic occupation that have spread through most of the Brazilian south atlantic coast between 6,000 and 1,000 years BP approxi mately (for a lenghty description and discussion of the general characteristics of these sites see Prous 1992). Although scientifically investigated since the late nineteenth century, the main features of the social systems that produced them still remain rather obscure. At the start the main focus of interest was whether they had human origin or were natural phenomena, but some prospective researchers have advanced interesting ideas about site formation, chronology and subsistence (e.g. Wiener 1876; Loefgren 1893; Krone 1914) and physical and racial charac teristics of its population (Ladislao Netto 1882; Lacerda 1885; Roquette Pinto 1925). 1 Systematic destruction have decreased only in the 60's, thanks to the efforts of some outstanding early archaeologists like Paulo Duarte, Luis de Castro Faria, Jos? Loureiro Fernandes and Pe. Jo?o Alfredo Rohr, who have fought steadily against systematical loothing of the sambaquis, and have passed the first federal law on protection of archaeo logical sites in 1961. Nevertheless, the intense residential and touristic development althrough the brazilian shoreline from the 70's on is still leading to the recurrent disappear ance of many sambaquis.</page><page sequence="4">78 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 15 Salgado "'S ' / y ' BRASIL Bah?a .. y-y Rio de Janeiro 'f Cananeia/Joinville - yS Imarui/Camacho Vi/ Figure 1.

The main contributions of this research for the archaeological perspective are the first interpretations on the evolution of the coastal landscapes through the Holocene, and a series of radiocarbon dates that, although poorly contextualized archaeologically, allowed for a chro nological setting for this middle-late Holocene occupation. The first modern archaeological research started around the fifties, with the studies of Emperaire (1955) and Emperaire &amp; Laming (1956), soon followed by others like Castro Faha (1955) and Loureiro Fernandes (1955), including north american archaeologists like Alan Bryan (1977,1993) and Wesley Hurt (1974). Joseph Emperaire &amp; Annette Laming-Emperaire were among the pioneers on the establishment of the scientific archaeological research in Brasil, bringing the first C14 datings for these sambaqui sites and the first comprehensive archaeological analysis on the brazilian shellmounds. In the sixties the first systematic interpretive schemes were developed, with a strong influence on the general thought regarding the sambaquis that has remained alive to the day. Archaeologists, impressed with the huge amounts of accumulated shell, frequently disposed in very flat and regular layers of variable composition and thickness, have generally taken these layers as debris of successive episodes of occupation related to very mobile and simple bands of gatherer-fishers, considering the shellfish as their main subsistence basis (e.g. Rauth 1968; Beck 1972; Kneip 1977; Garcia 1972; Prous &amp; Piazza 1977; Heredia &amp; Beltr?o 1980; Garcia &amp; Uchoa 1980). Wherever it has been possible throughout the bibliography, the closer ex amination of the sequence of dates against the stratigraphical sequence strongly suggests that the building-up of the site has alternated fast accumu lation episodes with longer occupation levels.The first ones are typically com posed by thick and soft layers of a rather homogeneous composition (frequently a single hard-shell species like anomalocardia brasiliana), while the others usually display smaller layers composed by heterogeneous materials includ ing clay, sand and a mix of broken soft-shell species (like mussels), some times including artifacts, sometimes very dark and hard, intermixed with many thiny charcoal lenses related to open fires (Emperaire &amp; Laming 1956; Piazza 1966; Prous 1992; Afonso &amp; De Blasis 1994, among others).</page><page sequence="9">Some References for the Discussion of Complexity Among. 83 Many of the sambaquis from the southern shores display an overall dark layer, quite thick in some sites, with low shell contents, but rich in stone and bone artifacts, as well as burials, patterned very much the same way as the lower layers. With more recent datings (around a thousand years ago), these dark upper layers sometimes produce reasonable amounts of pottery sherds, related to the late ceramic occupations known asTupiguarani and Itarar?Tradi tions (Brochado 1984; Schmitz 1988). Small and shallow sites containing ex clusively this darken upper component of the sambaquis also appear, being designated as "shellfish gathering camps" by some authors (see Prous 1992:267-305 for a comprehensive description and discussion of these sites). The variability of the artifactual and shellfish content in these layers pro vided, together with the variation of the sea level and the progressive shift of the coastal shorelines, the basic argument for claiming high degree of mobil ity, to which was also added, sometimes, a supposed ?very poorly docu mented, it must be said? cultural diversity between lithic and bone artifact styles through successive layers (or episodes) of occupation. Cultural "phases" based in this "content variability" of the sambaquis, especially the contrast between the shellmound proper and its darker upper layer, very common in the southern shores sites, have been proposed (Beck 1972; Piazza 1974; Dias 1972; Mendon?a de Souza 1981), and it is no surprise that no one has ever been able to use them to produce any comprehensible analysis of the global characteristics of the sambaqui society and its development through time. These mound-builders remained thought of as technologically "primitive" and dependent on the distribution and productivity of the shellfish banks, in spite of an expressive variety of bone artifacts strongly suggesting an effi cient fishing technology, as well as some relatively rare ?and not so easy to explain? sophisticated artifacts and sculptures finely carved on hard stone and whale "earbone" (bula timp?nica', Tiburtius, Leprevost &amp; Bigarella 1949; Prous 1977).This rather simplistic and reductionist perspective has been very influential throughout the sixties and seventies, and remained essentially the same until very recently (see, for example, Schmitz 1987 and Lima 1991). The abundant human skeletal remains generated by the archaeological ex cavations on sambaquis were another matter of research and discussion since the end of the eighteenth century (e.g. Ladislao Netto 1882; Lacerda 1885). After a great deal of discussion about "racial characteristics" of the "man from sambaqui," the main contributions can be summarized in two kinds of analy sis. In one hand, there are quite a few references about physical completion and anathomycal characteristics of the sambaqui people, considering their robustness as related to a canoe and sea adaptation (an argument reinforced by the presence of sambaqui sites in islands, sometimes considerably far from the shoreline), as well as the habit of diving for shellfish gathering and, possibly, big fish hunting (Mello e Alvim 1993; Mendon?a de Souza 1995).</page><page sequence="10">84 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 15 On the other hand, some studies deal with genetic diversity, migration and contact with other populations, based upon paleogenetical analysis of the sambaqui skeletal remains (Neves 1988; Neves &amp; Cocilovo 1989). Consider ing the genetical flow evidence gathered through the study of the museums collections, these authors argue that it must have been considerable amount of relationships among the sambaqui and other populations, an argument which account as well for the claimed cultural diversity among the sambaqui people (Neves 1988). Few studies have allowed for demographic inferences, and in these differ ent approaches have been used, such as volume estimates of food remains (Krone 1902; Orssich 1977; Hurt &amp; Blasi 1960; Rauth 1968), households size and area (Orssich 1954, Hurt &amp; Blasi 1960; Rauth 1968; Barbosa, Gaspar &amp; Barbosa 1994), site area (Posse 1984; Gaspar 1991 ), ratio of number of buri als vs. site volume (Fish et aliiin press) and the table of life estimate (Machado 1992; Uch?a, Mello e Alvim &amp; Gomes 1989). Although very much exploratory, these demographic inferences display considerable divergence, which allows us to think that, at least, significative differences in site size and function, as well as regional variability, should be present throughout these coastal mounds. More recently a new trend in sambaqui studies have appeared, focusing in dietary and zooarchaeological studies (Garcia 1972; Lima 1991 ; Figuti 1992 e 1993; Bandeira 1992). Basically, they take the faunal remains of the mounds as direct evidence of the sambaqui people's diet. Interpretations so far seem to shift slowly from the simplistic perspective of an evolution from shellfish gathering to a growing reliance on fishing subsistence, to a more elaborate approach taking the sambaqui contents from a moundbuilding perspective (e.g. Figuti &amp; Klokler 1996), with more criterious methods of sampling and labora tory analysis, which seem to point to a systematic predominance of fishing activities throughout the settlements occupation. Besides the recent zooarchaeological analyses mentioned above, the many nicely shaped bone artifacts usually found into the shellmounds (Figure 5) seem also to be related to a well developed fishing technology, a point of view largely overlooked until now (for exceptions see Heredia et a///1982 and also Gaspar 1991). These artifacts account for different fishing techniques and strategies with the use of hooks, harpoons and nets, as well as net weaving. Although the range of activities related to the lithic industries found in the shellmounds is still unclear, it seems clear that some of these artifacts are also related to fishing and fish processing. A variety of small quartz and quartz ite flakes are present, as well as bigger flakes and scrapers made from other hard rocks like basalt, and a fairly large amount of ground stone like metates and manos strongly suggest plant processing. In fact, there is a study on a skeletal collection from the Corond? site in Rio de Janeiro considering dental wear evidence (Turner II &amp; Machado 1983; Machado 1992), which argue that the frequency of caries and the wear patterns indicate a strong reliance on</page><page sequence="11">Some References for the Discussion of Complexity Among.. 85 Figure 5. Bone artifacts from Pia?aguera sambaqui, state of S?o Paulo (from Garcia &amp; Uchoa 1980:50).</page><page sequence="12">86 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 15 carbohydrates, which might mean wether the presence of intensive harvesting of wild plants or even, in some areas, an incipient management of cultivated foodstuffs as manioc (see also Neves, Scaramuzza &amp; Unger 1984 andTenorio 1991). It must be said that these southern coastal sites have never been exam ined in terms of settlement system studies (see Gaspar 1991 for an excep tion), neither have one of these structures been analysed as a whole entity, as the excavations have always exposed only small portions of them. The com plex building-up stratigraphical characteristics of these sites were taken rather roughly, with no considerations regarding the formation processes (in the sense of Schiffer 1987) involved in its development. It could be said that interpreta tion so far reflected a rather "normative" view of the archaeological record. It might be interesting to examine the reasons for this "normative" perspec tive. Surely one of them was the absence of an adequate ecological, geo and zooarchaeological approach, in order to have a more "realistic" (in opposition to the "impressionistic" dominant view) approach of the meaning of the subsis tence of that population as recorded in the mound contents.These gaps have been greatly funfilled with the zooarchaeological studies already cited, which revealed a general pro?minence of fishing instead of shellfish collecting as a subsistence strategy. Together with the closer analysis of the rather different formation processes that have taken place through the successive layers along the sometimes slower, sometimes faster building-up of the mound, these new perspectives are surely bringing much less simplistic readings of the archaeological record and, as a consequence, brighter insights into the sambaqui moundbuilders ways of life. Another reason seems to be the general lack of anthropological perspec tive in the archaeological research in the country. Most of the archaeological research until the eighties was conducted by professionals with a strong prac tical training and empirical knowledge, but very little theoretical background. So, they lacked the anthropological perspective that could make a better jump from the artifact to the people who made it, or better saying in this case, from the shell to the guys who have eaten it. This scenery is slowly changing in the last years, with some new perspec tives coming to the scene. Besides the already cited zooarchaeological stud ies of Figuti, Gaspar &amp; De Blasis (1992) have claimed for a intentional mound-building approach in dealing with these sites, and have used it in their current research, trying to investigate the presence of built-up structural fea tures like flat shell platforms and clay floors, and what would be their func tional meaning (Barbosa, Gaspar &amp; Barbosa 1994; Afonso &amp; De Blasis 1994). All these studies are beginning to change the "bands of nomadic shellfish gatherers" old picture and point to a more complex archaeological context, a potential situation for the occurrence of what has been called "complex hunter</page><page sequence="13">Some References for the Discussion of Complexity Among.. 87 gatherers" (Koyama &amp; Thomas 1982; Price &amp; Brown 1985; Arnold 1996). So, the main objective of this paper is to review a few examples of clues to this alleged complexity in the bibliography, as well as open a discussion on what kind of complexity the data available thus far really points to. A closer review at the bibliography shows quite a few clues that we are dealing with a more complex archaeological context. In order to review this data, we will organize it into four basic themes: (1) settlement function and lifespan and cultural continuity; (2) settlement patterns and demography; (3) social organization and inequality, and (4) territorial circumscription vs. extra regional relationships. Site Function and Cultural Continuity First of all, some of these sites have good chronological sequences, upon which the span of site (and region) occupation can be framed. In performing this task Gaspar (1995) has found that many sites have been continuously occupied for long periods without evidence of abandonment.This perspective is strongly reinforced by the study of Bryan (1993), which stands up for cul tural continuity throughout the occupation span of the site he has excavated in the early sixties at the northern shore of Santa Catarina. In fact, the artifactual variation he has found in lithic and bone tools, as well as in the features and layers content, speak more of diverse functional and contextual circumstances than of actual clearly different cultural patterns. Even after the introduction of pottery in the upper layers of the sambaqui, most of the other current techno logical patterns still remain the same throughout the 4,000 years of site occu pation. More evidence is provided in a very interesting report by Tiburtius (1966), who has been very fortunate in recording the main features of a large sambaqui which has been progressively (it has taken around ten years) and completely excavated for commercial purposes. He not only reported features that seem to have served for habitational purposes, within a central surface formed by successive flat layers encircled by a huge ditch with no clear stratigraphie pattern, but also propose a basic sequence on how the site has been progres sively built, with some fireplaces that endured for the most of the lifespan of the settlement, unfortunately never dated. In the darker layers frequently found in the middle or top of the sambaquis evidences of habitat structures have been occasionally reported (Orssich 1977; Carvalho 1984; Kneip et a///1992). In some cases, habitat structures seem to have been built with thick clay floors (Barbosa, Gaspar &amp; Barbosa 1994) or concretionated flat surfaces, while in others huge shell platforms seem to have been built for settlement purposes (Afonso &amp; De Blasis 1994). Definitely, it seems clear that at least some of these sambaquis have served as perma nent (or semi-permanent) residential settlements (or villages, as some display</page><page sequence="14">88 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 15 a considerable size), at least for a good while throughout the settlement life time. Another very interesting perspective has been advanced by Paulo Duarte (1968), after conducting research (in the beginning with Joseph Emperaire) in four sambaquis situated at the lagunar areas on the shore of the state of S?o Paulo. Excavating almost exclusively on the basal portions of the sites, as they were already largely destroyed by mining, he examined mostly the thick lower basal layers finding almost no artifacts, but dozens of burials. He con cluded that there was no evidence for habitation in these sites, and that they were a kind of early form ("neolithic") of pyramids, or mastabas, built for cerimonial funerary purposes, thus observing correctly that not all the mounds have been residential sites. Prous (1992:216-217) shows that sambaquis dif fer a great deal not only in size, but also in the amount of burials present, also suggesting functional differences. Curiously, Wiener (1876) has refered to the big sambaquis of the southern shores as "monuments". This perspective has been reinforced by recent excavations at the Jaboticabeira II site near Jaguaruna, Santa Catarina, where about 125 linear meters of profiles have been cleared in the very middle of the site, taking advantage of the nearly vertical faces of the cuts left behind by mining activi ties, complemented by a combination of hand-excavated and backhoe tests in different locations of the site (Fish et aliiin press). In the many meters of mapped profiles and ancillary exposures, the same set of features have ap peared again and again.This set consisted of burial pits, hearths, and postholes originating on the surfaces of successive sambaqui stages, providing evi dence for both exclusive funerary function, and incremental building-up of the mound (Fish et alii in press). In fact, as we are realizing now, quite a few of these sites seem to have been used as cemeteries, perhaps in some cases before acquiring other settlement functions in later times. Evidently, these sites seem to display different functional roles into the settlement system, which seem to have also changed through time, what makes the archaeologist's task of investigating these mounds not an easy one. To conclude this item, it seems that there is more evidence for cultural continuity than for the "technological and economical/dietary descontinuities" claimed by some researchers (e.g. Beck 1972; Dias 1972; Lima 1991 ). If vari ability has been noticed, and in fact it does occur, it seems to be according pretty well to the sites' functional diversity, the large regional and ecological range of the sambaqui occurrences, as well as along the reasonably long (about four thousand years) duration of such a coastal cultural tradition. Even the genetic diversity claimed (Neves 1988) seems reasonable in this case, as it is well known that population, language and culture (particularly material culture) do not necessarily overlap with the sharpness and clarity that some archaeologists would like them to do. Although cultures must be thought of as dynamic and ever-changing entities, many social groups are known to have</page><page sequence="15">Some References for the Discussion of Complexity Among.., 89 kept in contact with other groups through marriage, exchange, war and other kinds of relationships without necessarily changing their own structural and cultural patterns in a rather significant way. Settlement Patterns and Demographic Expansion As has already been said, there is a large number of sambaquis, and they cluster in certain areas such as protected and environmentally rich and diver sified bay-estuarine systems like Guanabara, Cananeia-lguape, Paranagua and Joinville, or lagunar and open-beach resorts like the Camacho and Imarui lagoon area, in the southern coast of Santa Catarina, or the Araruama and Cabo Frio region in the state of Rio de Janeiro. These aggregates are com posed by sites of different size, morphology and relative contents as artifacts, different species of shellfish and burials, as well as they differ in location in terms of proximity to strategical environmental spots, protection against pre vailing cold or strong winds or next to canals and other strategic places. In some studied areas they also seem to "behave" in relation to each other, displaying regular spacing and distribution. In these areas we seem to have sites with different sizes and functions apparently working as an integrated settlement system, although it has never been clearly documented. For ex ample, in the northern shore of the Rio de Janeiro coast, Gaspar (1991 ) shows some contemporary sites, similar in size and contents, distributed very evenly through the rather homogeneous flat and dumpy paleobeachridges that con form the Una river basin, and among them a few bigger sites, positioned in strategic loci in the landscape. As can be seen in Figure 8, these sites con form to a larger regional configuration including sites all through the lakes area near south (Kneip et aim 994), and these locational and relational characteris tics speak not only of an integrated settlement system, but also suggest an hierarquical organization of the communities throughout the region. These shellmound aggregates occur in many other favourable areas along the southern brazilian coast, and it seems that they were present in the north ern shores as well, where they have already almost disappeared.The colonial town of Salvador, Bahia, has been built with the materials from the sambaquis of that bay, which are reported as huge and numerous by chroniclers from the seventeenth century. Although these northern sites have never been studied in a systematic way, it seems that they share many basic features with their southern counterparts, what makes some archaeologists think of a general and very widespread "sambaqui tradition" all over the brazilian coast (for an example, see Willey 1971). Many of these sites, usually the bigger ones, display a long-term regular occupation and evidence of cultural continuity.The growth of the sites, as can be seen in their expansion in terms of the area occupied, as well as in their height, and also the large number of sites within these aggregates, strongly</page><page sequence="16">90 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 15 suggest a steadily demographic intensification. There is also skeletal data suggesting a steady population growth through time but, again, this is another badly documented issue, with scanty and difficult to compare information. Data from Rio de Janeiro, S?o Paulo and Paran? sites provide modest esti mates around a hundred persons living in each site (Uchoa, Mello e Alvim &amp; Gomes 1989; Posse 1984; Carvalho 1984; Gaspar 1991 ). On the other hand, in our already cited study at the cemetery site of Jaboticabeira II on the lagunar area of southern Santa Catarina, preliminary estimates based on the ratio of the number of burials found in the exposed areas by the overall site volume suggest that astonishing figures around forty thousand people were incorpo rated during the time lapse of the construction of the mound, radiocarbon dated between 2,880 and 1,800 years BP. These estimates are reinforced by an earlier study of Castro Faria (1952) at a nearby site of Cabe?uda, where the ratio of burials by the site volume provides similar figures. The estimates above seem to be exaggerated (some too small, others so much large!) but the problem is that, unfortunately, until now excavations have never been large enough to permit a more reliable populational/demographical approach, whether in site or regional level. However, even if these demographic parameters are still approximative and in most cases have no adequate chronological control, they are useful in suggesting that populations of consid erable size are involved in this moundbuilding occupation, and that some ar eas, like the lagunar resorts of Imarui and the Joinville areas at the southern shores along the Santa Catarina state, with a sedentary way of life on the same territory for a long period of time, might have had an expressive demo graphic intensification throughout the timespan of the sambaqui culture, what would certainly undermine the still prevailing view that they were very simple and shellfish-dependent shifting bands. Sedentariness and demographic increase might have led to a negative ef fect as they expanded upon the available resources. However, anthropological studies with the traditional fishing communities of the Paran? and Santa Catarina coast (Diegues 1989), and also the recent ethno-archaeological reconnais sance by Maria Dulce Gaspar at the Camacho lagunar area strongly suggest that the lagoon could act as a kind of "storage facility", producing pretty large amounts of food even in the "bad times", it is to say, when the main fishing resources are not fully available, as it usually happens in winter times. There fore, the resource base for this population probably have never become criti cal, judging by the contemporary traditional fishing societies that still remain in these areas, as well as their exceptional productivity. To conclude, besides the general lack of data regarding the spatial pattern ing of the settlement systems, as well as their apparent expansion, it seems clear that this growth occurred into specific areas and that, around 3,000 years ago, a population of considerable size was concentrated upon the southern shores of the brazilian coast.</page><page sequence="17">Some References for the Discussion of Complexity Among.. 91 Territoriality and Cultural Integration Although there is no available data about political integration at regional and supra-regional level, the typological homogeneity from the lithic and bone in dustries (in spite of arguments in contrary, as can be seen in Beck 1972; Piazza 1974; Dias 1972; Prous 1992), as well as the structural characteristics of the sites themselves, argue for a great cultural homogeneity in time and space. It also might be said about the variety of bone and shell adornments, which include shark-teeth and olivella necklaces, as well as teeth of terrestrial fauna from surrounding forest environments (like monkeys, peccariand oth ers). The most common bone artifacts include a variety of types such as hooks, needles, harpoons and elongated points, clearly reflecting a well developed fishing technology, related to the systematic exploitation of the diversified aquatic resources, which probably has intensified through time. The abun dance of fish and shellfish remains, as well as the scarcity of evidence regard ing the use of other foodstuffs (besides growing evidence of the presence of vegetal items), clearly points to a society turned to the aquatic resources, due to both its productivity and reliability. The intensification of such an economy pressuposes locational stability, and in fact there is no evidence of mobility, or transhumance, regarding other and more distant ecological settings, a per spective reinforced by the scarcity of items with exogenous provenience. In sum, the reliance upon sea and lagunar resources might have led these societies to a higher degree of territorial circumscription, and it might be that some of the bigger mounds have also the basic function to display such situ ation, spatial and cultural landmarks ("monuments", as put by Wiener in the late 1800's), as they can be seen from far away (specially from the sea and lagoon off-shores) and are pretty evenly spaced, as demonstrated in some of these coastal regions like the northern shores of Rio de Janeiro (Figure 6) and the Camacho area in Santa Catarina (Figure 7). Evidence of another nature is provided by the peculiar and rare stone sculp tures (sometimes also carved on bone) that are occasionally found in these shellmounds, but exclusively in the southern shores from Cananeia-lguape to Rio Grande do Sul.These pieces have been collected over the years due their impressive aesthetic value, and Prous (1977) have studied about 250 of them, providing an excellent stylistic analysis.They display geometric motifs as well as naturalistic representations of animals, mainly fishes and birds, but occa sional anthropomorphic figures might appear. Themes like reproduction and fertility appear occasionally, but most of the pieces depict isolated animal images, carved with high degree of technical skill and realistic accuracy (Figure 8). Most of them bear a central cavity in the ventral side which, to gether with their peculiar and elegant design, speak of ritual and particular uses.</page><page sequence="18">_ 42?30 42 0 CD -,-,- ^ ) rW / OCEANO ATL?NTICO SILVA JAROIM / ( \ ^' ?RIO BONITO ^^^V^ ?

In fact, the familiarity of this canoe-bound population to the aquatic environment certainly provides the ideal situation for an intense circulation of information (and goods) althrough the coast, an argument that reinforces social and cul tural integration, also useful for explaining the migratory populational move ments up and/or down the coast, with no much contact with the planaltic hinterland until the appearance of pottery around 2,000 years ago. Social Organization and Inequality This is for sure the most "touchy" problem to deal with when the emergence of more complex patterns of organization is on discussion, regarding the fishers collectors-hunters society of the sambaquis. Evidence is scanty, and usually provenient from poorly documented situations. Let us focus on three aspects which seem to point more directly to more complex patterns of social organi zation, as well as to the existence of social inequality among the sambaqui moundbuilders society. These aspects are concerned with communal organi zation of labour, funerary ritual regarding communal cemeteries and special treatment to the dead. They are still very fragile evidence, but anyway seem to point to some kind of progressive complexification of the social relations among the sambaqui people. The building up of some sites, specially in Santa Catarina where the bigger mounds are present, might have involved intensive labour efforts.The flat and large shell platforms upon which some of the sites stand, some with more than 80,000 square meters and about two meters thick, seem to have been built rather quickly, using basically a single shellfish species (Alfonso &amp; De Blasis 1994). In Rio de Janeiro some sites have floors built with burnt clay (Barbosa, Gaspar &amp; Barbosa 1994), although in this case the areas covered are much smaller, resembling a few houses'floors. These evidences suggest organized supra-kin labour, although it is still unclear how many people are involved and what are the leadership characteristics that control these com munal moundbuilding efforts. It is important to bear in mind that some of these mounds are more than 30 meters high, with basal areas bigger than 150,000 sq. meters. Even if with think in gradual and progressive building through many generations, proportions are very impressive. Another kind of evidence is provided by the existence of the communal cemeteries discussed above (Duarte 1968, Fish etalihn press). In spite of the many burials that can be found into almost every mound, some of them seem</page><page sequence="22">96 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 15 to have been built specifically as cemeteries. In fact, the analysis of about 125 linear meters of profiles in the Jaboticabeira II sambaqui near Camacho lake, in the southern shores of Santa Catarina, leaves little doubt that the overall moundbuilding process is related to the construction of a sequence of smaller burial mounds, followed by "flattening" of the place in a higher level, when the process starts again. Many of these burial mounds are frequently associated with aggregates of food remains that might be interpreted as feast ing as a part of the funerary ritual, to which seem to be related peculiar struc tures depicted by open fires and postholes. The burials themselves provide what might be considered the strongest evidence of social inequality among the sambaqui people. While some people are enterred on the place they have been living before death, frequently below the house floor (e.g. Barbosa, Gaspar &amp; Barbosa 1994), others are ritually buried in the cemetery. While some of them are simply buried, others display rich and diversified accompaniements, sometimes even the beautiful stone sculptures we have already seen. Unfortunately, there are not excavations large enough to allow the analysis of the spatial and contextual relationship among the many burials within a single shellmound, whether a cemetery or a "regular" site. Anyway, altogether, these evidences strongly suggest social inequality among sambaqui people, although it must be stressed that our cur rent readings of this rather complex archaeological record seem to be very simplistic and even, possibly, somewhat naive. These evidences for differences of status among the funerary accompani ements in the burials have led Paulo Duarte and others (e.g. Beck 1972; Orssich 1977) to suggest the existence of "chiefs" in the sambaqui society, a point of view still very difficult to sustain. But the mere observation of the funerary rituals involved in the moundbuilding sequences of some of these sites, as well as the extremely elaborate funerary structures depicted in the literature (see Prous 1992:216-223 for a comprehensive synthesis), makes clear that they involve a great deal of ritual investment, including the funerary "architec ture" itself. The extensive profiling of Jaboticabeira II (Fish et alii in press) indicates that these cemetery mounds have a variety of spacial marks (as poles, stones, etc) for the already existing burials, but there is also some evidence of "recycling" older human parts in new burials, as well as some mani pulation of human bones into artifacts and other obscure contexts, occasion ally interpreted as evidence for cannibalism. To finish this topic, it seems clear that some kind of social inequality is present among the sambaqui people but, due to the lack of systematic and problem-solving oriented research, it is still too difficult to produce any consis tent interpretation of these scattered evidences. Anyway, the existence of some kind of "principals" in the sambaqui society seems very likely, and it is not unreasonable to think that the wide territorial spread of the stone sculp tures, sometimes associated with very elaborated and ritualized burials, might</page><page sequence="23">Some References for the Discussion of Complexity Among.. 97 have something to do with the manifestation of some kind of incipient supra communal religious or political pattern of social organization. Conclusion All these evidences seem to support the claims for a complex-hunter-gatherer society, possibly in some areas (as it seems to happen in the Rio de Janeiro coast) acquiring some experience in gardening manioc and other small crops at the end of the period, between ten and fifteen centuries ago (Tenorio 1991 ). So, as we have seen, the basic conditions for growing social complexity seem to be present, but, what are the concrete evidences for that claim? When we put together all this data, including our own new evidence (Fish et alii in press), it is very clear that the sambaqui society (or societies) do not seem to be simple bands of shellfish-dependent fellows moving across the coastal landscape after the shellfish banks, trying to escape from starvation and bad nutrition, "suffering in paradise" if we consider the extraordinary pro ductivity and richness of resources that can observed in these tropical and sub-tropical lagunar resorts. Many, if not all, of the characteristics described above have been used for arguing for degrees of complexity (e.g. Renfrew 1973; Testart 1982; Keeley 1988; McGuire &amp; Paynter 1991 among others). Koyama &amp;Thomas (1982) and Price &amp; Brown (1985), in very influential volumes, have shown a variety of worldwide situations of emergent hunter-gatherers (and, of course, fishers), but no specific parameter, or threshold, has been clearly established for defin ing them. Following Jeanne Arnold (1996), by itself, none of these clues dis cussed above is strong enough to support such a claim for complexity, which should be based solely upon undisputable evidences of supra-kin social orga nization patterns, and the existence of regular mechanisms (chiefdom) to con trol labour forces. So, what is the real meaning of the evidences above discussed? The spe cific research targets regarding the sambaquis can be summarized in a few objective questions, which seem to relate to a bundle of research problems. They are, basically: What are exactly the processes going on in moundbuilding growth? How many people are involved? What is exactly the economical ac tivities documented in the bone and stone industries? On a larger scale, what is the size of a regular settlement system? How many communities, or groups, are integrated in regular exchange networks? Are they also related politically? Do the regional distribution of some types of artifacts (e.g. the stone sculp tures) have some relationship with regional political or religious systems? The main problem with the sambaquis of the brazilian coast is the fact that these sites (and their problems) have never been studied in a sistematic way, with regular field research addressing specifically the questions outlined above, among other also interesting and related issues. It seems to us that, more</page><page sequence="24">98 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 15 than to simply say that they seem to be complex, give them a new label, what we need is good long-term archaeological research projects for the investiga tion of these mounds, in order to examine systematically their formation char acteristics as well as their overall regional context, in such a way that the conditions for this alleged complexity might be verified and documented. We have scattered data and pretty interesting clues about a supposed social com plexity of these fishing societies, but only a systematic treatment on a re gional level of the whole bunch of questions all tied together and hidden in the layers of the mounds will bring some light on the lifeways of that people. One of the basic steps towards a more comprehensive perspective would be start to look to the mounds not as kitchen middens but as built artifacts, thus not only reflecting subsistence and everyday life (and death) behavior but also as visible and strategical loci in the surrounding landscape, landmarks socially and culturally meaningful to the people who has made these struc tures grow up through the centuries, generation after generation. In fact, al though some monumental structures or phases in moundbuilding might be the result of a single sustained building episode, the final form of many others is the result of incremental events that produced successive stages. When these events maintained a common theme throughout subsequent episodes, the encoded message was repeated and reinforced. As the out come of cumulative reiteration by many participants over time, the ultimate magnitude of a monumental mound built in this way probably transmitted a more forceful message than its constituent stages. The key to the understand ing of such a monumental mound, then, is the reconstruction of the format and cultural context of the incremental events. If there is any kind of "complexity" related to these moundbuilders ?and actually there are quite a few clues that point in this direction?, surely it is here where we have to look for it. Consequently, to articulate the necessary and still missing regional per spective on the evolution of the settlement patterns, together with the study of the social and "architectural" processes that have taken place throughout the moundbuilding sequences, is one of the main targets of the sambaqui archae ology today.The first results of our own experience in performing this task has been presented elsewhere (Fish et alii in press), showing some of the new data available and how it has been obtained. In fact, the effort necessary to create the ultimately massive mounds up to 30 meters in height and several hundred meters in diameter is unlikely to have been incidental or without com pelling purpose. The concept of the huge sambaquis as landmarks and inten tional constructions, as articulated by Gaspar &amp; De Blasis (1992), was fundamental to these recent investigations at the Camacho lake region near Jaguaruna, Santa Catarina (figure 10), coordinated by the authors of this paper. Nevertheless, there is still much more to be done.Talking about emergence of complexity among sambaqui people is too easy. In order to follow, as Paul Fish and others have said, the specific "pathways to complexity" that have</page><page sequence="25">Some References for the Discussion of Complexity Among.. 99 been trekked by the sambaqui moundbuilders, we have to develop long-term regional research projects, and we hope that many other archaeologists and quaternary researchers might come to join our deep interest in these misterious shellmounds in the next years.
