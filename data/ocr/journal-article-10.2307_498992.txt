TSCHAN, Pennsylvania State University GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Archaeological Research in Rumania. - In ILN. June 17, 1939, pp. 1123-1125, Dr. RADU VULPE, Professor of Archaeology at Bucharest University, reports briefly on recent archaeologi- cal discoveries in Rumania. The center of Neo- lithic civilization was in Moldavia. This culture is known as the " Cucuteni" culture, from the site where it was first found. It is characterized by painted pottery with spiral motifs in two or three colors, and terracotta idols representing a female deity. In recent excavations conducted by the author at Izvoare an earlier layer was found be- low the first Cucuteni stratum, the first evidence of a prehistoric civilization in Moldavia. It has been called "Izvoare I." Its characteristic pottery is ornamented with lines of dots, which were pressed into the soft clay with a toothed comb before the vase was baked. Female and animal idols were also found. This prehistoric civilization was closely connected with the later Cucuteni culture. Excavations during the past season proved the existence of an intermediate layer, with pottery in a clearly transitional style. The origin of this Rumanian Neolithic civilization is still a problem, to be solved after further excava- tions and study of the results. It can be stated, however, that both the Izvoare and Cucuteni cul- tures have strong connections with the East, Mesopotamia, Central Asia and China. It is thought also that the original inhabitants were not Indo-Europeans. There is evidence of violent destruction at all the Cucuteni sites and a com- plete disappearance of the culture. This is attrib- uted to the first invasion of the Indo-Europeans at the beginning of the Bronze Age. Langobards, Bajuwars, Slavs.- In Mitteil. Anth. Ges. Wien, lxix, 1939, pp. 41 ff., E. KLEBEL at- tempts to bring forth some presumably new light, allegedly gathered in hitherto overlooked sources, on the movements and succession of the three stated ethnic groups. The Langobards are said to have been in the Danube valley from 506 until their departure for Italy in 568. The Bajuwars are supposed to have followed the Marcomani about the middle of the sixth century. As for the Slavs, the reader may judge the author's iniqui- tous thesis from the following quotation (p. 103): "Vor 567 hat kein Slave die Karpathen ueber- schritten oder in Boehmen siedeln koennen. Man kann es gegen tschechische Anmassung nicht oft genug wiederholen." The listed references confirm the suspicion that the author is not acquainted with standard works on Slavic antiquities many of which, incidentally, have been written in English, French, and German. Stone Circles in Northern Ireland. -In Ulster Jour. of Arch., 3rd ser., 1939, pp. 2 ff., O. DAVIES records ninety-one stone circles of various types hitherto unknown in literature. " The Ulster circles are nearly always composed of low stones, often not more than a few inches high and set on edge, normally not, contiguous. . . . The usual diam- eter is rather less than fifty feet. . . . Nearly all are above the 500 ft. contour . . . " (p. 2). The typological grouping is logically devised, the au- thor evidently having devoted ample time to field studies. There is no definite evidence con- cerning the purpose of the circles, although burial structures are said to have been found in several cases. The question of dating is likewise an open one. The author points out that they antedate the formation of the present peat which occurred some 2000 years ago. A possible relationship to the Mega- lithic monuments is suggested. Excavations at Clogherny.-In Ulster Jour. of Arch. 1939, pp. 36 ff., O. DAVIES describes his excavation and finds in two stone monuments. One was a megalithic chamber capped by a single stone, with a circular cairn, and surrounded by a ring of uprights; no pottery was found, but the</page><page sequence="3">674 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY author feels that the barbed arrow head of flint, found in the chamber, indicates the Bronze Age. The other site was a stone ring which failed to reveal any definite evidence of its original purpose. Davies opines that some circles may have been graves and that peat acid would conceivably dissolve cremated bones without stone covering. Chillham, Kent.-In AJ. xix, pp. 260-~81, R. F. JESSUP describes the excavation of the barrow at Julliberrie's Grave. Like most non- chambered long barrows this is dated late in the English Neolithic. Of particular interest is a flint axe of thin-butted Scandinavian type, providing evidence of the cultural connection with the megalithic graves of Holland and the Baltic. In the ditch of the barrow are Roman burials of the first century. Badbury Barrow, Dorset.-In AJ. xix, pp. 291-299, STUART PIGGOTT describes a carved stone discovered in 1845 in a barrow, now de- stroyed, located near Winborne. The stone bears carvings of daggers and axes. While representa- tions of axes are commonly found carved on mega- lithic monuments, representations of daggers are so far unknown in Brittany or elsewhere in Brit- ain, although found in Germany and in southern Europe. The date of this particular carving is the early Bronze Age. Dorset.-In Antiq. xiii, pp. 138-158, STUART and C. M. PIGGOTT publish for the first time a complete set of plans and descriptions of Dorset stone and earth circles. Several new sites are added to those listed in the 0. S. Map of Neo- lithic Wessex. Castor, Northants. -In Antiq. xiii, pp. 178-190, C. HAWKES describes the Roman camp site near Castor on the Nene. Three camps, first discovered in 1930, are described from air photos. These are perhaps datable to the earliest occupation of the site under Aulus Plautius; two seem to be tempo- rary marching camps, while the third seems to have been used under Ostorius. Roman Roads.-In Antiq. xiii, pp. 191-206, F. G. ROE discusses the lack of relationship be- tween the present winding roads of England and the Roman road system, basing his conclusions upon his observation of the way roads were de- veloped in Alberta some forty years ago. EGYPT Semitic Influences on Egyptian Civilization.-- B. HROZN- in Archiv Orientdlni Dec., 1938, on the basis of the words for cereals, hoe, plough, beer, and brewers' vat, comes to the conclusion that the Egyptians borrowed them from the Baby- lonians and Sumerians long before the Pyramid Age. He maintains that the Semitic Akkadians were in Babylonia with the Sumerians in the first half of the fourth millennium B.C. He believes that the Semites invaded or filtered into Egypt from Amurru during the second prehistoric Egyptian civilization and that the Semitic in- fluence upon the Egyptian language extended over a long time. Latest Discoveries at Hermopolis.-Dr. SAMI GABRA reports in ILN. May 13, 1939, pp. 838-840, on the results of the last season's excavation at Hermopolis, the sacred city of Thoth. Work is be- ing continued in the subterranean galleries. The galleries excavated this year had not been plun- dered. The contents had not been disturbed since the doors were sealed by the priests about 600 B.C. The rooms were filled with thousands of jars. Some contained mummified cynocephali and ibises, sacred animals of Thoth. Other jars con- tained ex-votos, statuettes, wooden and falence objects. One bronze statue represents a priest kneeling with the offering between his hands. Most frequent are statues of ibises. A large de- motic papyrus was discovered in the archives office. It contains "a corpus of laws defining the relations between landlords and tenants, as well as rules of inheritance." MESOPOTAMIA Mari.-In Syria xx, pp. 1-22, ANDREf PARROT describes the ziggurat and the Ur III palace ex- cavated during his fifth campaign at Mari. On the site of the ziggurat at least seven periods of con- struction were discovered, ranging from pre- Sargonic days (before 2500 B.C.) to tombs that may be as late as the Sassanian period. The zig- gurat itself belongs to the class of small stage- towers. A little chamber near the northeast cor- ner contained a curious collection of seventy stone eyes, some still in their bronze casing. Artistically the best find of the season is a small bust of a man carrying a sacrificial kid. This piece, of Ur III date, has a wealth of detail. Parrot makes every reasonable effort to reconstruct the ancient scene from the excavated ruins-particu- larly in the field of religion.- In PEQ. July, 1939, emphasis is laid on the fact that the tablets found here shed light upon the fourth Lachish letter, which has a reference to signal-stations and sig-</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 675 nals. According to the Mari tablets signalling was done by lighted torches. A tribe of Benjaminites, settled on the Euphrates between Mari and Terqa, passed the news from one village to another by means of lifted torches; this method served both military and civil purposes. Oldest Extant Boundary Stone. - ANDRE PAR- ROT publishes the oldest kudurru (i.e., boundary stone) ever discovered (AfO. xii, pp. 319-324). The monument, which comes from Larsa and depicts seven interesting human figures, can be as early as the Jemdet Nasr period, but in no case postdates the Early Dynastic age. The kudurru bears a lengthy and well-preserved inscription, which Parrot does not interpret, but which deserves a thorough study. UnpublishedAssyrianReliefs. - ERNST F.WEID- NER concludes his valuable survey of hitherto unpublished Assyrian reliefs, with photographs and descriptions of eight more monuments in English museums (AfO. xii, pp. 325-341). The interest of this survey is enhanced by the fact that good pictures and drawings of some already known pieces are included for comparison. Turkish and Mesopotamian Ploughs. -In ZfE. lxx, 1939, pp. 343 ff., E. WVERTH discusses the typology and distribution of the plough in Anatolia and the Near East. He recognizes three fundamental types, which appear to be character- istic of as many geographic zones, and traces each type historically. The work is based on field and museum studies. Werth also correlates the major varieties of cereals and live stocks with each type. He includes a brief mention of the history of the plough in Mongolia and its relationship to Europe. Inscription from Kythera.- The inscription from Kythera discussed by H. Thomas in JHS. lviii, 1938, p. 256, is shown by ERNST F. WEIDNER in JHS. lix, 1939, pp. 137-138, to be an early Babylonian cuneiform inscription which has long been an object of study by Assyriologists. Dating perhaps around 1950 B.c. it reads as follows: "To the deity .... [......] ...... [.......]. Naram- Sin, [King of Egnunna], son of Ibiq-Ad[ad, King of E'nunna] for his life [dedicated (this)]." The Kythera inscription, early Babylonian seal cylinders found in Crete, and early oriental rec- ords raise the question whether in the first two centuries of the second millennium B.C. there were not trade relations, even if limited, between western Asia and the Mediterranean area as far as Greece. ASIA MINOR Cilicia.- J. GARSTANG has devoted two winter seasons (1937-38) to excavating an ancient mound inland from the port of Mersin; the place is called Souk Su Hilytik (Cold Water Hill), and com- manded a narrow pass between the Mediterranean and the range of the Taurus. The main trade route between the Troad and Mesopotamia by way of Carchemish ran past the mound. Here are Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures with marked Mesopotamian relations. A subsequent transi- tional phase suggests contacts with Troy and Les- bos, as well as with Early Bronze Age sites on the plateau. The higher levels (2100-1500 B.C.) reveal a period of continuous occupation by a people whose relationships extended to the Ana- tolian plateau and Northern Syria. These were crowned by a Hittite fortress of the Early Imperial Age. The uppermost levels show traces of inter- rupted periods of settlements in Early Greek, Byzantine, and Mediaeval Arab times (PEQ. July, 1939). Hittite Hieroglyph.- R. DEMANGEL, in BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 180-193, constructs a series of hypothetical relations between the Hittite hiero- glyph for "god" and various scattered prehistoric and Greek motifs. PALESTINE AND SYRIA Palestine "Neolithic." - As the result of his last excavation at Jericho, Garstang announced the discovery of a Neolithic culture, resemblances to which were to be found in Thessaly, rather than in the Orient. Level VIII was labelled "Recent Neolithic," level IX "Middle Neolithic," and levels X-XVII "Ancient Neolithic." Beneath the latter was a Mesolithic culture represented by microliths of Natufian III-IV types. The Ancient Neolithic was characterized by an absence of pottery and worked metal, its chief positive fea- ture being a certain type of house construction. Pottery made its first appearance in Middle Neo- lithic (level IX) and we are told that in this pottery "we have, no doubt, the very beginnings of pottery in Palestine." At no other site in Palestine has a Neolithic stage been found, the Mesolithic being followed directly by the Chalcolithic. The Jericho finds, as interpreted by Garstang, thus provide a strik- ing exception to the general rule. But PIRE VIN- CENT (RB. xlvii, pp. 561-589; xlviii, pp. 91-107) maintains that they should really be classed as</page><page sequence="5">676 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY " Chalcolithic." He draws attention to the dis- agreement between Garstang and his technical collaborators as to the Neolithic character of the pottery and flints of level VIII. Ben Dor had labelled the pottery from this level "Chalco- lithic," but Garstang changed the label to "Re- cent Neolithic." It is true that Ben Dor regards the pottery of level IX as Neolithic, but Pere Vincent says that the difference between the pottery of levels VIII and IX is so slight and the stratigraphy so uncertain that there is no justifica- tion for pushing that of IX back into the Neo- lithic. He agrees with Miss Crowfoot that the flint industry of Jericho is a local variety of Tahunian II, but he points out that, according to Neuville, Tahunian is not a Mesolithic or Neolithic culture as Buzy, its discoverer thought, but a Chalco- lithic. The case for an affinity between the sup- posed Neolithic of Jericho and the Neolithic of Thessaly gains little support from the cautious pronouncements of Droop. As for the style of building in levels X-XVII, Pere Vincent main- tains that it has parallels in the Chalcolithic levels of Ghassul, Fara', Megiddo, and 'Affuleh. The comparison of house 208 with the megara of Thessaly is pointless, for the latter cannot be earlier than the first half, or the middle, of the third millennium. The absence of metal must not be stressed too much in a country like Palestine; it does not even appear in levels which Garstang himself assigns to Early Bronze. The absence of pottery in the early levels is no more surprising than its absence in Stage VII of Megiddo, or in level V of Ras Shamra (assigned by Schaeffer to the Chalcolithic era). The conditions of life had not yet imposed the need for it. When it appears in level IX it is already in too developed a form to represent the product of a nascent industry, and must be due to the intrusion of an outside influence. We must be on our guard against assuming the same succession of prehistoric cultures every- where. The failure to find a Neolithic stage in Palestine creates only an apparent hiatus. The succession at Jericho as elsewhere in Palestine is Mesolithic-Chalcolithic-Early Bronze. There even seems to be a racial unity between Mesolithic and Chalcolithic. The Lachish Letters.- An important contribu- tion to the interpretation of the first six letters is made by PiRE DE VAUX in RB. xlviii, pp. 181- 206. He vigorously assails the theory which re- gards the letters as a group dealing with the same subject. The palace was not rebuilt following its destruction in 597. The fortified complex at the principal entrance of the city where the letters were found marks the seat of the administration from 597 to 588. The letters recovered represent a scanty survival from its archives and have no necessary relation to each other. The supposed reference to Jeremiah is declared incapable of proof. Temple at Brak. -In IL N. 1939, pp. 882-884 (one color-plate), M. E. L. MALLOWAN describes the latest discoveries at Brak. During the fall of 1938 the earliest temple yet discovered in Eastern Syria was excavated. The building was of mud brick, buttressed on the north and west with massive blocks of limestone and basalt. The south wall was decorated with a mosaic of clay cones, stuck into plaster, and a frieze of rosettes with petals made of black shale and white marble and centers of red limestone. Somewhat similar orna- ment has been found at the Sumerian city of Uruk. It dates at the end of the Jemdet Nasr period. The temple rested on a great platform of mud brick. Thousands of votive offerings were thrown in with the bricks when the foundation was dedi- cated. The most characteristic dedication was a magic eye, made chiefly of alabaster. Owing to the great number found in the building, it has been called by the excavators the "Temple of a Thou- sand Eyes." Though the temple had been de- stroyed and the majority of its treasures stolen, many remarkable objects were recovered. The walls of the central shrine room were covered with copper panels stamped with the design of a magic eye. A base against the south wall of the shrine must once have supported a statue of the god. The three exposed faces of this base were origi- nally decorated with a frieze. A great part of this frieze was found. Each panel is a little over three feet long and eight inches wide. It is made up of blocks of blue limestone, white marble and green shale with gold borders. It was fastened on a wooden backing. The gold borders are fastened with gold-headed silver nails. The frieze is thought to show religious symbolism, the materials and design representing those used on the exterior of the temple walls. Many beautiful amulets were also found among the objects dedicated in the platform. They are exquisitely carved in various animal forms. Hebrew Language.-A. M. HONEYMAN in the PEQ. April, 1939, discusses the pottery vessels of the Old Testament.</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 677 Negeb. -E. EPSTEIN, in the PEQ. April, 1939, considers the Bedou the father rather than the son of the desert. By raiding settled areas and harrying cultivators, the Bedou has helped the desert to encroach upon the sown and to expand beyond its natural borders. Such a struggle is apparent in the Gaza-Aqaba-Dead Sea Triangle. One reason why the Negeb Bedouin do not have high social standing is that they do not devote all their time to camel breeding, but occasionally do some desultory cultivation. The competition of the train, the motor car, and the aeroplane has caused a drop in the prices of camels and horses, and in consequence the social life of the Bedouin has gone through a period of confusion and disintegration. Palestine Stirrup Vase from Gett. -In Mitteil. Anth. Ges. Wien lxix, 1939, pp. 39 ff., A. JIRKU describes a stirrup vase found by a peasant, pre- sumably in a grave, at Gett. The author considers the vessel a local copy, datable to the Late Bronze Age. The small size of the specimen (height 11 cm., base diameter 4.5 cm., maximum diameter 7.5 cm.) is taken by him to indicate a funerary rather than a domestic purpose. Especially note- worthy is the painted decoration, which consists of parallel vertical stripes between two horizontal bands placed respectively on the neck and on the belly. The author considers the decoration, exe- cuted in reddish-brown on a dark-brown ground, an original and unique phenomenon. TRANSJORDANIA Petra.-In QDAP. viii, pp. 87-115, plates xliii-lvi, MR. AND MRS. HORSFIELD present the second instalment of their report on the excava- tions conducted at Petra from 1929 on (cf. AJA. xlii, p. 565). The pottery sequence was established by four cuts, the largest being made in the Katfite dump. Three strata were discerned. Stratum I is assigned mainly to the late second century A.D., Stratum II mainly to the first century B.C.-A.D. There is some overlapping between the strata, owing to the fact that the spot excavated was a dump. For this reason, in Stratum III the pottery was classified as coming from the front, middle, and inside of the cut. That on the inside would be the earliest. The front yielded coarse pottery with fragments of sigillata of the second century B.C., while the inside yielded dated jar handles of the late third and first half of the second centuries B.C. and imported Attic ware of ca. 300 B.c. A large number of tombs were then examined and classified according to the established pottery sequence. Many, of course, were completely empty. Only two (E3 and E4 on the Mu'eisra Ridge) contained pottery of the early Stratum III type. Both were shaft tombs. The bodies had evi- dently been burnt outside the tomb and the bones then placed within, together with a few bronze treasures and common pots. The pottery of the majority of the tombs belongs to the types from Strata I, 2 and II, 1 (1st cent. B.C.-A.D.). The Pal- ace Tomb, the Khazne, the Tomb of the Urn, and the Tomb of the Roman Soldier were cleared in 1936, but all had been rifled. In the latter a sar- cophagus base was found which indicates that the niches in these tombs were designed to receive sarcophagi. The tomb of Sextus Florentinus yielded only a few fragments of alabaster vases, found in the central and most elaborately carved recess in the back wall, which doubtless marks the burial place of the legate. The Tomb of the Triple Dushara contains three graves orientated to three baetyls of Dushara, a unique arrangement at Petra. On carefully scraping off the red sand from the top of grave No. 2, "a layer of quicklime ap- peared down the centre of the grave, roughly the shape of a human figure in outline. .... When broken into, this disclosed a layer of black dust, about 0.10 m. thick, extending its whole length and beneath was another layer of lime." In the other two graves the same method of cremation had been employed. Sayce thought this discovery proved the Edomite use of lime for burial and the corruption of the text of Amos 2, 1, since the curse should fall on Edom rather than on Moab. But is not the evidence so far against regarding it as an Edomite or Nabataean custom? The pinnacle known as Ez-Zantfir was subjected to a careful surface examination and the outlines of a large fortress discerned. The excavators be- lieve it to have been the residence of the Naba- taean kings. The eastern face was scarped, but on the west four levels can be traced: an upper platform crowned by a tower, and below it three terraces, each about 20 m. wide. There is evidence that it was occupied as early as 300 B.C. Nabataean Statues.- PARE DE VAUX reports the discovery at Ma'in of two headless busts of Nabataean divinities. One has a strap over the right shoulder, like Ares, and may possibly be an image of Shai' el-Qaum. The other bust is that of a goddess. The statues probably come from the middle of the first century A.D. Their presence at MA'in shows that the Nabataean frontier ex-</page><page sequence="7">678 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY tended this far north (RB. xlviii, 1939, pp. 78- 86). Minaean Jar. - The South Arabic inscription on the jar discovered by Glueck at Tell el-Kheleifeh is discussed by M. RYCKMANS in RB. xlviii, pp. 247-249. He believes the signs are monograms, such as appear occasionally on South Arabic monuments. The elements of the monograms are drawn from the North Minaean writing. Since the jar comes from a stratum which Glueck dates to the eighth century B.C., Ryckmans believes this is evidence that the North Minaean inscriptions are not later than the eighth century. Coins of Transjordania.- A. S. KIRKBRIDE (in PEQ. July, 1939) classifies in a general manner approximately 5000 ancient coins found in Trans- jordania between the years 1928 and 1937. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Greek Archaeology.-In REG. lii, 1939, pp. 70-205, is presented the annual Archaeological Bulletin, a thorough summary, from the impor- tant learned periodicals of Europe and America, of the preceding year's work in (I) Prehellenic pe- riod, to p. 86 (P. DEMARGNE); (III) Sculpture, statuary, to p. 175 (CH. PICARD); (IV) Ceramics, painting, mosaic, to p. 205 (J. AUDIAT). Part II- Architecture, Topography, will appear in the April- June issue; Part V-Numismatics, is postponed to next year. -P. LEMERLE in BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 441-476 discusses archaeological discoveries in Greece with numerous illustrations. New Discoveries at Delphi.- A brief report of some remarkable finds made recently at Delphi by the French School at Athens appears in ILN. July 29, 1939, pp. 202-203. Excavations were re- sumed at Delphi in 1938. It was discovered that the pavement of the Sacred Way consisted of reused material. Some of these stones were raised opposite the Stoa of the Athenians. Objects of gold, ivory and bronze were found buried in a ditch beneath the pavement. Parts of three life- sized and five smaller chryselephantine statues were found. The ivory is badly eroded but the gold is perfectly preserved. One ivory head can be identi- fied quite clearly as Ionian sculpture of the first half of the sixth century B.C. Two superb gold plaques were found. They were originally at- tached to the legs of a statue and represented the embroidery on the bottom of the dress. They are adorned with reliefs. The Eastern motifs, griffins, sphinxes, gorgons, lions, deer and other animals are in the Ionian style and of the same date as the ivories. In addition to the remains of chrysele- phantine statues, a great many ivory figurines were found. They seem to have formed part of a battle scene and may have decorated the arms of a throne. A number of archaic bronzes has also been recovered. Philippi. -In BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 1-3, R. DEMANGEL publishes a plan of the site, based on the excavations of 1914-1937 and on air photo- graphs, of which one is published on pl. 2. These photographs revealed several structures invisible from the ground, but DEMANGEL does not specify which ones. H. Ducoux and P. LEMERLE (op. cit., pp. 4-19) publish with elaborate plans the walls on the slopes, which are Greek (soon after 358 B.C.), repaired twice in Byzantine times, and the walls of the acropolis, where the Greek walls seem to have been thoroughly destroyed; but the By- zantine fortifications of 963-969 still stand. Not a block of the entire circuit is attributable to the Roman period. J. ROGER (op. cit., pp. 20-37),with more good plans, and a better knowledge of Greek forts and walls (though not of Corinth), publishes the walls in the plain, with three remarkable gates of the Greek period. J. CouPRY (op. cit., pp. 42- 50) publishes a semicircular Ionic portico of reused (?) materials, situated west of the Forum. The Mussel in Ancient Art.-In the Bull. de l'Inst. Arch. Bulgare xii, pp. 1-131, MARIA BRATSCHKOVA reviews the uses of the mussel in antique art and lists the recorded examples. She shows that the oldest use was in connection with the birth of Aphrodite, but that the use is highly extended as an architectural member, where it is confused by the Romans with the baldacchino as an imago clipeata, as a vessel of various materials and shapes, and as a mere ornament. She traces the various uses from the Cretan period to the thirteenth century A.D., although it was most common between the second century B.C. and the second century A.D. Origin of Hera Cult.- In Athenaeum xvii, 1939, pp. 105-137, U. PESTALOZZA examines the Argive myth of o10 and the Greek and Oriental figures of cow goddesses and bull gods, particularly Anahit and Mithra, in an attempt to prove the Minoan- Mycenaean origin of Hera. He concludes that Hera was originally one of the manifestations of the great Mediterranean and eastern female goddess. Armor in Tyrtaeus.-RR NIERHAUS in JdI. 1938, pp. 90-113, discusses the implications of</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 679 Tyrtaeus vi-vii, 25. Wilamowitz, in arguing against DUimmler that the passage was not evi- dence of the custom of castrating a fallen enemy, failed to prove his case. But by the monuments he might have proved it. The body armor of the Tyrtaean phalanx was a metal cuirass, as the art of that time shows us. To stab above or below the cuirass was the only way of wounding an enemy so protected; here Tyrtaeus is describing not muti- lation, but a wound in the exposed groin. Inci- dental contributions of this paper: proof that the great shields of Geometric art correspond well enough to the Homeric tower shield, and that the latter did not survive into the time of Tyrtaeus; lists of seventh-century cuirasses and of vases illustrating the offensive tactics necessitated by the defensive armor of the phalanx; argument that a well known "Melian" vase-painting need not be interpreted as the duel of Achilles with Memnon. A Sybarite Himation. - D. S. ROBERTSON takes issue in JHS. lix, 1939, p. 136, with P. Jacobsthal's interpretation of a Sybarite himation, published in JHS. Iviii, 1938, pp. 205-216, and argues that with the proper text corrections in Pseudo- Aristotle, de miris auscult., 96,838a, a less puzzling design on the himation would be easily understood as showing in the center six Greek gods, along the top a frieze of "Scythians," along the bottom a frieze of "Persians," at one end Alkisthenes, at the other end Sybaris. Such a himation might have been made before 510 B.c. Athenian Topography.-In BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 55-59, A. OUTREY publishes two drawings by Fauvel of the Pnyx region, with notes on Chateau- briand and Lykabettos. Papyri.--REG. li, 1938, pp. 502-539, presents the usual excellent papyrological bulletin by PAUL COLLART. The present list, No. VII, contains the material for 1937. AEGEAN CIVILIZATION Excavations at Krisa.-In BCH. lxi, 19387, pp. 299-326, J. JANNORAY and H. VAN EFFENTERRE present the archaeological evidence, which proves most notably (see BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 33-43) that the only ancient occupation at Krisa was a Middle Helladic settlement destroyed by a fire and soon rebuilt, in Late Helladic I-II; in Late Helladic III the citadel was walled. Pottery from Krisa.--In BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 110-147, J. JANNORAY and H. VAN EFFENTERRE continue the publication of the campaign of 1937. L.H. pottery, gray Minyan, yellow Minyan, dec- orated styles were found (this classification is a modification of the usual groupings). There is no break when L.H. begins; no distinction between L.H. I and II; and no break at L.H. III. Minoan Hieroglyphic Inscription. - Found by a peasant at Mallia, a triangular stone, cut to form a "libation table" on top, has an inscription of 15 characters running vertically down the side - the longest extant hieroglyphic text on stone. Date M.M. III, since the characters are consid- erably stylized (F. CHAPOUTHIER, BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 104-109). ARCHITECTURE Temple of Apollo at Corinth.- SAUL WEINBERG, in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 191-199, presents an ac- count of the pottery which he recovered from the undisturbed fill under the north pteroma of the temple and from debris dumped on the temple hill. Both deposits seem to date to the period of construction of the temple, and the evidence for both is in agreement. The pottery belongs to the early third quarter of the sixth century B.C., and indicates that the temple was constructed at that time. The old belief that the builder was the ty- rant Periander must be abandoned. Column Bases of Rhoikos. - The temple of Hera at Samos, built by Rhoikos, and excavated by Wiegand and Buschor (AM. 55, 1930, pp. 72 ff.), the earliest great Ionic dipterous of the archaic period had 134 columns. Of these 102 cylindrical bases and tori of equal height (ca. 27 cm.) have been recovered, mostly found built into the foundations of the more recent temple. HEINZ JOHANNES in AM. 62, 1937, pp. 13-37, gives an exact account of all bases, their original position, diameter, height and turning. The fact that the bases are turned like wood in a process described by Pliny xxxvi, 90, is their outstanding feature. Different profiles in delicate carving are used for the different groups of columns employed in dif- ferent parts of the temple. This technique had no future, but it is characteristic of the spirit of adventure of the sixth century B.C. Triglyphs.-In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 421-438, R. DEMANGEL considers the Doric frieze not a living or fossilized element of the order, but as one of the most sacred Dorian religious sym- bols. Material from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Crete, Sparta, Corinth, etc., is cited. The Mausoleum.- H. W. LAW in JHS. lix, 1939, pp. 92-109, re-examines the evidence for</page><page sequence="9">680 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the tomb of Mausolus, in the opinion that only the restorations of Cockerell and Stevenson ex- plain in any way the reputation of the monument in antiquity, especially for lightness and beauty. He presents a new restoration in accordance with the "small-plan" type. This kind of plan allows an orderly progression from summit to base, Law believes, an important feature of which is the pyra- mid of 24 steps below the pteron, equal in height (24 ft., 6 in.) to that pyramid which surmounted the pteron, each pyramid having a base below it. This small-plan type likewise allows a restoration of columns on the pteron in a double row, twenty- two in the outer range, and fourteen in the inner. In the center of the pteron, which Law restores without a cella, he places a colossal statue of Zeus Labraundos. The long sides of the pteron allow six intercolumniations, measuring in all 61 ft., the fronts, five with a length of 54 ft., the whole base being approximately square, ca. 107 ft. in English measure on a side, and the monument some 118 ft. high, with the quadriga ca. 20 ft. more. The frieze representing an amazonomachy is located on the podium of the pteron; the frieze of a centauromachy on the base beneath the lower pyramid. The figures of Mausolus and Ar- temisia stand on the platform at the foot of the lower pyramid. The peribolos was probably ap- proached from below by a series of terraces from the agora, and by steps on the east and west, as well as by a staircase which Law believes existed on the north. NUMISMATICS Athenian Coins with Magistrates' Names.- Continuing his studies, the expert M. L. KAM- BANIS publishes in BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 60-84, a new tetradrachm, which establishes the series Dionysios-Demostratos. This series is one of a series of 19 to be dated after 83 B.c.; they are the last of the New Style coins of Athens. Greek Federal Coinage.- MARGARET THOMP- SON, in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 116-154, publishes a hoard of silver coins, buried in some place not certainly ascertained, shortly before 146 B.c., consisting mainly of triobola of the Achaean League, along with a number belonging to the Aetolian League, and earlier non-league coins, explained as circulated by the Aetolians. The au- thor devotes considerable space to the problem of the ascription of coin types to the various Achaean League cities, notably Troezen, Dyme, Megalo- polis, and Messene. SCULPTURE Herakles and Triton.- OSCAR BRONEER, in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 91-100, publishes an early archaic head from the excavations of the North Slope of the Acropolis. It fits the body of Herakles of the well-known Triton group, and faces for- ward, a fact which alters the conjectural restora- tions previously offered. Since the rest of the pedi- mental group was found in the "Tyrannenschutt" south and east of the Parthenon, the question is again raised whether "Tyrannenschutt " and "Per- serschutt" may not be one and the same thing. Attic Statue Bases.-In Bull. de l'Inst. Arch. Bulgare xii, pp. 132-181, ANTON RAUBITSCHEK discusses the technique and forms of the early Attic statue bases. He considers the methods by which the early bronze and marble statues were affixed to the bases, and the various types of blocks, pillars, and columns that were developed in order to elevate the statue and attract for it greater attention. Melian Reliefs.-P. JACOBSTHAL in JHS. lix, 1939, pp. 65-70, discusses the list of "Melian" reliefs, some twenty in all, that are strictly Melian, i.e., of known Melian provenience, and includes in this discussion two new Oxford reliefs recently presented to the Ashmolean Museum by J. D. Beazley. One represents a third known rep- lica of the lyristria with the lover, the other, a most important addition to the group, gives the upper half of the incomplete Niobid scene from Berlin, showing a paidagogos and a maiden be- longing to a pre-Pheidian cycle of the Niobids, undoubtedly ranking with the Choephoroi plaques in Berlin and Paris as a copy of a priceless paint- ing. These reliefs owe their essencc to the Choe- phoroi and Niobe of Aeschylus, and the Niobid group is a work of the earliest part of the decade 460-450 B.C. Funerary Stele from Delphi.-In ECH. lxii, 1938, pp. 97-103, C. KAROUZOS examines the stele which was not, he shows, first published in BCH. lx, 1936, pp. 364 ff. The date should be ca. 470; the style is simple and severe, not archaic. "Poseidon" of Artemision.-The grandiose bronze found in 1928 in the sea near the promon- tory Artemision off the island of Euboea has been considered by some scholars as a statue of Zeus, by others of Poseidon. (Cf. BEYEN, La Statue d'Artimision, 1930; KARUZOU, Deltion 13, 1930/1, pp. 44 fF.; NOACK, Antike 5, 1929, pp. 214 ff.) J. JUTHNER in AM. 62, 1937, pp. 136-148, refutes</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 681 both interpretations, because the position of the fingers of the right hand is in his opinion adapted neither to the holding of a thunderbolt or of a trident. The index finger is removed from the others in such a way, that according to JtTHNER, only the leather strap of a spear, fitted into the hand, can have been wound around the index and the middle finger (cf. fig. 1). Thus, in his opinion, the bronze represents an athlete beginning the movement of rushing forward before throwing the spear, which he holds with the help of the tense knot of the strap. The heroic scale (2.10 m.) he considers no hindrance to this interpretation, as he finds the Doryphoros of Polykleitos of about the same height (2.12 m.). He forgets, however, that the "canon" is standing upright, while the "Poseidon " is striding forward and thus the actual height is larger. The Parthenon Master. -B. SCHWEITZER (Jdl. liii, 1938, pp. 1-89) argues that while analytical connoisseurship has shown that there are many styles in the sculptures of the Parthenon, it has rather illuminated than obscured the unity of de- sign. There is variety, and there is development, which culminates in the almost anachronistic il- lusionism of the west pediment. But the more exactly we understand the process of execution- the means used and the order followed - the more clearly we perceive that the variety is controlled, and that the development corresponds to the ex- perience and growth of a personality, the Parthe- non Master. Study of the Parthenon from this point of view must begin not with the metopes, its earliest sculpture, but with the cella frieze; for here, in the correlated work of regular teams of sculptors, is the clearest revelation of elaborate planning; here too we pick up the chronological thread. Its earliest sections are the western and eastern, the former designed before the latter, but both executed at the same time, on the ground; next, the northern, executed in situ during the work on the concretely "objective" east pediment (for the epigraphic evidence does not really con- flict with this); later, also carved in situ, the south frieze, before the completion of which the west pediment must have been begun. Where is the designer's own style most evidently discernible? Most palpably, though not most significantly, in the metopes, especially where poor execution does but reveal the very conception that it has marred, or anticipations of a later manner are set off by an old-fashioned context. But for essential faithful- ness to the Master's prescription we may look especially to the east pediment, the climax of his technique of control. The west pediment, though he set its content and manner, lacked his super- vision in the last stage of its execution, like the west half of the south frieze. In seeking to recover the Parthenon Master's method of designing, we must recognize that his energy and his time were limited. Sketches for each division of the sculp- tures he must have made, and in the north and part of the south frieze these were traced on the stone itself. But the plastic models, indispensable for metopes, short friezes and pediments, were not, at least in their final and decisive form, his work. Was the Parthenon Master Pheidias? That is a question which must await the sequel to this preliminary study. Boy's Head from Parthenon Metope.- Our knowledge of the Parthenon metopes is frag- mentary. We therefore may hope that more frag- ments and particularly some of the many missing heads might turn up occasionally. WALTER MjLLER, director of the Albertinum, the museum of sculpture in Dresden, publishes a youthful male head in private possession in Dresden, which has been broken from a high relief (AM. 62, 1937, pp. 52 ff., pls. 29-30). The style is similar to the heads from the earlier Parthenon metopes (cf. Collignon, Le Parthenon, pls. 36-37; Smith, Sculptures of the Parthenon, pls. 23, 2 and 24, 1), which continue the style of Kritios. The scale is a little smaller than the heads of the Lapiths and therefore could only represent a boy from some otherwise lost metope. Attic Three-Figure Reliefs. -Amelung in 80 Berlin Winckelmannsprogram, 1923 has added the relief of Herakles with the Hesperids to the three well-known reliefs of Orpheus, Eurydice and Hermes; Theseus, Peirithoos and Herakles; and Medea with the Peliads, which since Reisch (Griechische Weihgeschenke, pp. 130 if.) have al- ways been considered a unit of the same type, period and artistic school. HEINZ GOTZE, in RM. 53, 1938, pp. 189-280, pls. 32-38, corroborates this general opinion by collecting all replicas of the four reliefs, discussing their restorations, style, artistic value, date of the copies, their execution and relationship to each other, in order to en- visage the originals as closely as possible. He pub- lishes a little known fragment of the Theseus- Peirithoos relief in Paris (pl. 35, 2) and an excel- lent unpublished fragment from the Herakles- Hesperids relief in the Metropolitan Museum of Art at New York (pl. 37, 2), which looks like part</page><page sequence="11">682 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY of the same copy as the one in Leningrad (pp. 225-7, pl. 36, 2 = Amelung pl. I). GOTZE assumes one master and two helpers, each of whom exe- cuted two of the reliefs, the one the Orpheus and the Theseus-Peirithoos relief, the other the Peliads and Hesperids reliefs (pp. 235-239, figs. 3-6). He decides for a date shortly after 420 B.C., the reliefs being in style intermediate between the Parthenon frieze and the Nike temple parapet (pp. 239-245). He would like to follow Bruno Schrider in making Alkamenes the master of the reliefs (Schrider, Alkamenesstudien, p. 9). The use as voting offerings is certain, but it is impos- sible to determine the ancient setting. In his last chapter (pp. 251 ff.) GOTZE refutes the opinions of different scholars who believed that various other reliefs reconstructed from vases and sarcoph- agi belong to the same class as the three-figure reliefs, such as the sacrifice of Iphigenia on the Ara of Kleomenes, Iphigenia with Orestes and Pylades in Tauris, Pelias and the Peliads and others, which, however, though related, are not identical in their composition. Lastly G6TZE sketches the earlier story of the development of the three-figure-composition from Corinthian bronze reliefs, Attic vases, and the Eleusinian relief to the harmonious and tense compositions of the four great classic Three-Figure Reliefs. Dedication of Leagros.- A. E. RAUBITSCHEK, in HIesp. viii, 1939, pp. 155-164, argues that the base in the Athenian Agora bearing the dedication of Leagros to the Twelve Gods was made for a statue of Leagros as victor in the pentathlon, and interprets a red-figured cup in Baltimore as show- ing Leagros looking at that statue. He would date both the base and the cup in the neighborhood of 490 B.c. The Sleeping Ariadne.- The Hellenistic figure of Ariadne sleeping in a restless position on rocks is known best by the replica in the Vatican (Amelung, Sculpt. Vat. Mus. ii, pp. 636 ff.; Galleria delle Statue No. 414, pl. 57; BrBr. pl. 167). Beside the copies in Florence (BrBr. pl. 168) and in Madrid (EA. 1552) there exists a cast in several German museums, which it has been considered was taken either from the copy in the Vatican or the one in Madrid, before these were restored by artists of the eighteenth century. But WALTER MUfLLER in RM. 53, 1938, pp. 164 ff. has proved that the cast (fig. 1) is taken from a bronze cast made by Primaticcio for Francis I of France in 1540 (fig. 3), i.e., before the statue in Rome was laid with the upper part in almost a sitting position on a rocky ground. The artist's conception of the original position of the statue must be accounted for in case the statue were lifted from the modern rock bed and reconstructed in its original condition. Hellenistic Heads. -RUDOLF HORN in RM. 52, 1937, pp. 140-163, pls. 33-43 and 53; 1938, pp. 70-90, pls. 9-21 has published two instalments of research on Hellenistic heads, which have grown out of a paper inspired by Professor Arnold von Salis at Heidelberg. They are a continuation of the studies of Kramer. RM. 46, 1931, pp. 144 ff. and in Nach. Gitt. Ges. N. F. I, 1936, pp. 217 ff. The first part gives an analysis of the heads in the smaller monument of Gauls, giants, Amazons and Persians, dedicated by the Attalids. Most scholars have dated these groups at the end of the third century, a date defended recently by B. Schweitzer in Sitz. Leipz. Akad. 43, 1936, pp. 97 ff., but the excellent investigations of HORN have now definitely proved that these groups belong in the period of Attalus II (159- 138 B.C.; cf. also Schober in JOAI. xxviii, 1933, pp. 1092 ff.). They are separated from the larger group by a development of style which leads beyond the heads of the great altar, with its new method of movement of the muscles and of the single features. HORN also proves impossi- ble the attempt of Zschietzschmann, RE. xix, pp. 1255 ff. and Ant. Kunst 112, pp. 43 ff., who tries to date the great frieze of the altar in the period 220-200, together with the large Gauls, because the altar clearly belongs in the first half of the second century, the period of Eumenes II (197- 159 B.C.). The smaller monument belongs shortly after the altar. The sequence thus is: large figures of Gauls, altar, small groups, Laocodn. Cf. also recently: V. K. Muller in Art Bull. xx, 1938, pp. 395; 397 f.; 403 f. He dates the large Gauls after the end of the wars in 228; the Gigantomachy, in the "balanced stage of the balanced period" and the smaller groups of Gauls in the time of Attalos II. The strong Hellenistic tradition continuing in the east in the imperial period shows in a head from a relief, which HORN (p. 162 f., fig. 7, pl. 38, 2) wrongly places between the groups of Attalos II and the Laocoon. It is the fragment of a sarcophagus from Adalia, similar in type to the Achilles sarcophagus in Madrid (Robert ii, pp. 68 ft., No. 692, pl. 65; cf. Rodenwaldt, AA. 53, 1938, pp. 389 ff.). It is an Attic work of the second century A.D.</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 683 The second part deals with female heads, the date of which is based on coins (pls. 9-10), idealis- tic heads of Persephone, Demeter, Artemis on the one side, portraits of Ptolemaic queens on the other side, continuing and supplementing the studies of Pfuhl, JdI. 45, 1930, pp. 38 ff. The development in the third century B.C. goes from definite forms to softer ones, with toned-down transitions. In the first half of the second century a new way of rendering the hair with lively curves wound into each other develops. A turning point is reached about 130 B.C. on the coins of Cleopatra Thea, pl. 10, 12, with its dry and harsh execution, which continues into the first century B.C. (Cap- tion of pl. 10 reads by mistake second and third, instead of second and first centuries). With the help of this investigation a head from Egypt, now in Berlin, is dated in the beginning of the first century B.C. (pp. 78 ff., pls. 22, 11 and 17, 2), between the Aphrodite of Melos (pls. 15, 1 and 16, 2) and the Baebia of Magnesia (pl. 18, 2). To the same period belongs the Pudicitia from the Prytaneion of Magnesia (pl. 15, 2) and the relief of Lakrateides (pl. 19). To the third quarter of the second century be- longs a female head (p. 89 f., pl. 20) which prob- ably has been sold in Rome to America. It is a Roman copy of an original of the period a little later than the great altar frieze and similar to the Polyhymnia, pl. 21, 2. Marble Heads from Anatolia.-In Anatolian Studies Presented to William Hepburn Buckler, pp. 249-268, DAVID M. ROBINSON publishes three marble heads in his own collection in Baltimore, two of which are said to come from Dorylaeum, and the other from Rhodes. The first of these heads is that of a woman; it was in modern times sawn into two pieces, but is otherwise intact. The technique and marble indicate local Asia Minor workmanship, and the writer believes it to be a copy of a bronze statue, perhaps of Demeter, of the fifth century B.C., made in the reign of Tiberius, and adapted to become the portrait of a local noble lady, possibly a portrait funeral statue. It was not intended to be seen from the rear. An unusual feature is that the ears are pierced for earrings. The writer notices a number of other heads that show similar features. The second head is from Rhodes, and is an original of the fourth, or, more probably, the third century B.C. It is of a very coarse-grained Parian marble and, barring a few nicks, is intact. It is part of a statue of a youthful athlete, probably a wrestler, wearing a victor's wreath. The technique is eclectic, showing strong Praxitelean influence, but with suggestions of Scopas and Lysippus as well. The closest parallels are a head in the Fogg Museum, and one in the possession of Prof. T. Leslie Shear (AJA. xx, 1916, pp. 283-298); in fact, it is believed that this head and the Shear head are by the same hand. The third head is that of a young woman and is a life-sized Roman por- trait. It is of Asia Minor marble, well preserved, and of great beauty. The hair is dressed in the so- called "melon" style, and this coiffure tends to date the head in the first century B.C. VASES AND PAINTING Terracottas and Vases in Athens.-In BCH. 1xi, 1937, pp. 349-363, S. PAPASPYRIDI-KAROUZOU publishes objects in the National Museum hitherto neglected, recently acquired, or recently cleaned: (1) a woman's head in terracotta from Argos, first half of seventh century; (2) a woman's head in terracotta relief, "daedalic", third quarter of seventh century; (3) a man's head in terracotta, first century B.C.; (4) a fragment of a Melian relief; (5) a Protocorinthian vase in the form of a pomegranate, technically one of the best Protocorinthian vases; (6) a unique three- alabastra-on-a-cylindrical-askos, Corinthian; (7) a fine Attic aryballos; a red-figured rhyton in the form of a sheep's head, Villa Giulia painter; (8) a pelike of ca. 460-450 showing Phrixos; (9) a Boeotian terracotta citharist of ca. 500-490, with coloring; (10) a terracotta head of a woman with Boeotian coiffure, ca. 490-480, with much color; (11) a Boeotian terracotta female figure, seated, likewise coiffured and colored. Sophilos. - SEMNI PAPASPYRIDI-KAROUZOU has published in AM. 62, 1937, pp. 111-135, pls. 43- 66, a monograph on Sophilos. Up to date rela- tively few vases had been added to the signed lebetes from the Acropolis (pl. 51, Graef, i, 26, 587; Pfuhl, MuZ. fig. 202), Pharsalos and Menidi (pl. 53; Bequignon, MonPiot 33, 1933, pp. 43 ff., figs. 1-7 and fig. 12, pl. VI). Mrs. Karouzou adds tomb pinakes in the Vlastos col- lection at Athens, belonging to the earliest sixth century (pls. 48-50, 1) and about forty other vases. The list of works is given on pp. 139-4. The oldest belong to a period of Corinthianizing style, the middle ones to the high watermark or "severe style" and the latest to a decadent pe- riod, when Sophilos partly returned to his older preference of rows of animals. Thus the "Vourva"</page><page sequence="13">684 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY vases were painted by him, partly in his first period (pls. 43-44, from Vari), partly in his floruit (pl. 45, from Vourva) and partly in his old age (pls. 59-62), one of which, perhaps considered to be a valuable heirloom, was buried in the tomb monument of Marathon (AM. 18, 1893, pl. II; CVA. Athenes, Nat. Mus. III, pl. 13, 1-2). The latest vases are monotonous and poor, in contrast to the pleasant polychromy, fine engraving and narrative style of his best period. Mrs. Karouzou adds to his earliest period also the works of the Gorgon painter (Payne, NC., p. 192; Pottier, Vases ant. du Louvre ii, pp. 81 ff., pl. 60), which she enriches with the fine plate in the Walters Art Gallery at Baltimore (pl. 65). Sophilos emerges from this study as the most important, perhaps the only important painter of his period. He introduces mythological subject matter in Attic vase-painting, his preference being the story of Achilles. Red-figured Vases from Al Mina, Sueidia.- J. D. BEAZLEY publishes in JHS. lix, 1939, pp. 1-44, the red-figured vases found in the excava- tions conducted by Sir Leonard Woolley at Al Mina, Sueidia. The ware is all Attic. It does not become plentiful until well in the third quarter of the fifth century, and in the fourth century its importation increases. The most important vase discovered is a large calyx-krater, of yellowish clay, 61 cm. high and 55 cm. across, the finest in Beazley's opinion of all late Attic vases. Much is missing, including the handles. It appears earlier in date than the late Kertch calyxes. Below the scenes represented occurs a pattern that is unique, an alternation of flowers, anthemia rising from an acanthus calyx, and bucrania. The scenes show on the obverse the contest between Apollo and Marsyas, with attendant divinities, and on the reverse a four-horse chariot with Athena and Nike, both facing front, and again with other divinities present. The Kleophrades painter. - J. DEN TEX (AM. 62, 1937, pp. 38-40, pls. 23-24) adds an amphora in Vienna, Austria, to the known works of the Kleophrades painter (Beazley, Bilder griech. Vasen vi, Der Kleophradesmaler, pp. 23-29). It has been attributed to Epiktetos, as a conse- quence of the wrong reading of a badly preserved inscription. This begins with an E, but has only five to six, not nine letters. The vase belongs to the early period of Kleophrades, when his work was close in style to that of Euthymides (cf. Beazley, p. 16). But the interesting enlarged photo of the head (pl. 24) shows clearly that he cannot be identical with Euthymides. Teisias.-In AA. 1938, cols. 68-77, J. F. CROME publishes two kantharos handles belong- ing to Gbttingen University, remarkable for finger rests in the form of silens' heads, the beards of which serve the purpose of the normal spurs. Attribution to Teisias, Athenian potter resident in Boeotia, is permitted by the fine curves of the handle arch, such as are characteristic of Teisias' signed kantharoi (listed). Teisias is a not uninter- esting figure. On the one hand, his inscriptions, less and less staunchly Attic, tell rather quaintly a story of acclimatization; on the other, his spirited transformation of a Boeotian shape shows him as a determined missionary of Attic taste. Two timid Boeotian imitations of the present plastic device are known. About 500 B.c., and not earlier, is Teisias' date. Columnar Monument of Herakles. - There ex- ist more than a dozen representations of a monu- ment consisting of four columns erected on a base of three to four steps. They have been collect- ed by Frickenhaus (AM. 36, 1911, pp. 113 if.) and they are now revised and supplemented by O. WALTER (AM. 62, 1937, pp. 41 ff., pls. 95-28). The most characteristic features are the facts that the epistyle does not sustain a roof and that there are no side walls. Thus it is a kind of pergola or arbor. On a vase in Athens, it is cov- ered with olive twigs, and serves as an open-air triclinium or lectisternium to the feasting Herakles, who is served by satyrs (pls. 25 and 27). It is thus a shadowy skias or pavilion. On the same vase, as well as on the relief in Boston (Frickenhaus, pp. 121 ff., pl. 2; Caskey, Cat. of Sculpture, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, pp. 102 ff., no. 47), a large vase in the shape of a dinos on a pedestal is another conspicuous feature. This may be the oinisteria (olMaTi'ptlc), the big wine pot brought in by the ephebes to Herakles according to Athenaeus xi, pp. 88 p., 494 f. Tondo Composition in Archaic and Classical Greek Art. -T. B. L. WEBSTER makes a study of Greek tondos over a period of four centuries, from the reign of Gyges to the era just before the accession of Alexander the Great, in JHS. lix, 1939, pp. 103-123. With the exception of the Strangford shield most of the tondos are of small size, varying from a foot to a quarter of an inch in diameter, on cups, plates, mirrors, and coins. The work is often of first quality and the tondos reflect the style and ideas of the period in which</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 685 they were created. Since permanence as well as change in decoration are to be found equally, the division of the circle by diameters and lateral symmetry extend straight down from the geo- metric age, and the various types of composition used repeatedly, such as the heraldic pair, the Union Jack, the triangle in a circle, are all based on these geometric principles. Hellenistic Relief Ceramics.- OTFRIED DEUB- NER (RM. 52, 1937, pp. 245-255) publishes a medallion of terracotta with brown glaze, which he bought in Rome and which is a replica of a medallion from the same mould at Munich (pl. 53). Both represent Eos seizing the hunter Kephalos. The same motive reappears on an engraved mirror from Palestrina in Brussels (fig. 2). The original for the scene belongs to the time of Alexander the Great, while the mould for the reliefs, used as an emblema in bowls, prob- ably comes from a Campanian workshop of the third century B.C. A similar style is found in a medallion from a black-glazed Calenian guttus (fig. 3) and in a silver-plated round bronze relief at Munich. They represent Dionysos fighting a giant, while another roundel of the same set at Munich represents Athena and Zeus, each fighting a giant (pl. 54). Similar round bronze reliefs, also silvered over, have been found in Southern Russia (fig. 4) and have been rightly interpreted as phalerae from horse trappings. This is true for the Munich pieces also. The date is fixed by the South Russian tomb as the period of Alexander the Great. The original invention of the design is put by DEUBNER ca. 400 B.C. Epigrams of Antiphilos and Painting.- BERN- HARD NEUTSCH in RM. 53, 1938, pp. 175-188, investigates the relationship of three epigrams of Antiphilos of Byzantium to actual Greek painting. The one relating to a picture of Leda is of no value, but the two others can be used for the Medea of Timomachos and the Andromeda of Nikias, preserved for us in wall paintings from Herculaneum and Pompeii (figs. 2-3). Curtius (Wandmalerei, p. 306) and Horn (Stehende weib- liche Gewandstatuen, p. 2, supplement to RM. p. 14) have recently tried to separate the standing Medea (Hermann-Br., pls. 7 and 130; Pfuhl, MuZ., figs. 660-1) from the Timomachos attested by Pliny xxxv, 136, for the period of Caesar, dating it in the early Hellenistic period. NEUTSCH (p. 180 f.) tries to solve the problem by doubting Pliny and putting Timomachos into the same early period and thus restoring to him the stand- ing Medea. He rightly refutes the attempt of Bulle (Untersuchungen an griech. Theatern, p. 323) and Lippold (RE. vi A, 1294) to give to Timo- machos the seated Medea (fig. 1; Hermann-Br., pls. 73-74), which he dates in the second half of the fourth century. This date and the relation- ship of the seated Medea to Aristolas of Sikyon is however absolutely unprovable. Bieber (Review of Religion 2, 1937, pp. 4 ff.) believes the standing Medea belongs with Timomachos in the time of Caesar, together with the frescoes of Boscoreale and the Villa Item, in a period which is the height of republican Roman Hellenism in Italy. Mosaic in Malta.-E. PFUHL in RM. 52, 1937, p. 275, relates some observations made before the original. The colors in JRS. 5, 1915, pp. 35 ff., 79 f., pl. 3, are to be corrected in so far as they are purer and lighter. The mosaic is a late Hellenistic copy of a painting belonging to the height of the Hellenistic period and represents a satyr attacked by nymphs. Mosaics of the Seven Sages. - GEORGE ELDER- KIN in RM. 52, 1937, pp. 223-6, defends the thesis which he presented in AJA. xxxix, 1935, pp. 92 ff., pl. XXII, against Brendel, who had attacked it in RM. 51, 1936, pp. 1 ff., figs. 1-2, pls. 1-5. Furt- wiingler (in Gemmen iii, p. 166), discussing a replica of the scene on a gem (Gemmen i, no. 35, pl. 35), was the first to give the generally accepted interpretation of the two mosaics from Pompeii in Naples and from Sarsina in the Villa Albani as the seven sages of tradition. Brendel, believing the content to be more important than the artistic form, interprets the single figures with Thales as the leader discussing the celestial sphere at the court of Periander of Corinth. Elderkin recog- nizes the citadel in the background as being the Acropolis of Athens and in the person to the left with the royal fillet Demetrius of Phalerum, sur- rounded by Menander, Theophrastus, Aristotle, Heraclides of Pontos and two other peripatetic scholars of his philosophical circle, represented in the terms of the old seven sages. He considers the grofiping of the persons and their position in the near foreground as similar to the mosaic of Antioch with the judgment of Paris (pl. 49; cf. Morey, The Mosaics of Antioch, p. 28 f., pl. I), which also goes back to a late fourth-century Greek painting. The recently discovered pictures of the seven sages at Ostia (Guido Calza, Anticke 15, 1939, pp. 99 ff., figs. 1-5), which are attested by inscriptions, do not agree with the types on the mosaic (Calza, op. cit., p. 105 f., fig. 16), thus also</page><page sequence="15">686 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY testify against the old interpretation of the latter as being the seven old sages. INSCRIPTIONS Omega in Sixth-century Inscriptions.- L. H. JEFFERY points out in JHS. lix, 1939, p. 139, that the form 8, found in an inscription (at Phlius in 1924) and published by Scranton for the American School (Hesp. v, 1936, pp. 235 ff.) and interpreted as rl is to be compared with a similar form occurring in an inscription from Aspr6- kampo, near Perachora, namely 8, so copied by L. Ross (Arch. Aufs. ii, p. 661) and is to be re- garded as an co. These peculiar forms are perhaps the invention of one stone-cutter, who was responsible for both inscriptions. Archaic Inscription from Dreros.-In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 333-348, P. DEMARGNE and H. VAN EFFENTERRE publish for the first time the oldest complete Cretan law yet discovered. Its 40 words form a decree prohibiting anyone from being kosmos more than once in a period of ten years, with a list of magistracies whose holders are to swear to observe the decree, namely the kosmoi, the damioi, and "the twenty of the city." Com- mentary on syntax (notably close to classical Attic), grammar, substance; no photograph. Rectification, BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 194-195. The Oath of the Drerians against Lyttos.- In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 327-332, H. VAN EFFENTERRE shows that this famous inscription is not a copy of an early boustrophedon text, as had been uni- versally supposed, but an original document of ca. 200 B.C. Epigram from Argive Heraion.-L. W. DALY, in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 165-169, publishes a Doric capital unearthed near the Argive Heraion, bear- ing a sepulchral epigram in the Argive alphabet, dated by its letter-forms and profile to the early years of the fifth century before Christ. The buried man, Hyssematas, died in a war, which the author proposes to identify as the invasion of the Ar- golis by Kleomenes, and which he dates about 494 B.C. Notes on Attic Inscriptions.- Among five in- scriptions discussed by EUGENE SCHWEIGERT in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 170-176, two are of special interest. A section of the treaty of 433/2 between Athens and Philip is restored by comparing IG. i2, 53 with IG. i2, 87. Another inscription, IG. ii2, 4892, is restored to form part of a decree authoriz- ing repairs to the statue of Athena Parthenos. The decree is dated in 304/3 B.c., and may refer to the restoration of the Gorgoneion to the shield of the goddess, whence it had been removed. Administration of Delos.-In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 364-379, J. COUPRY publishes two preambles, one of 410/9 (Tod, GHI., no. 85) and one of 408/7 ("new," found in 1886), which show Athenian amphiktyones in charge of funds, without any collaborators in 410/9, but with Delian episkopoi or epitropoi in 408/7. Amphictyonic Accounts from Delos.- In BCH. lxii, pp. 85-96, J. COUPRY presents new readings and restorations, mainly of chronological import, of BCH. xxxv, 1911, p. 5, no. 1. Public Lands at Thespiae. In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 217-235, M. FEYEL re-edits AEh-r. xiv, 1931-2, p. 26, no. III, which contains (1) a decree of the third century B.C. ordering the lands to be rented, (2) the names of the magistrates in charge, (3) regulations. A second section establishes the values of acrophonic numerals for Thespiae (two systems), Orchomenos, and Akraiphia. Dedications by the Thespians.-In BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 149-166, N. PLATON and M. FEYEL pub- lish with full commentary a well preserved text of ca. 395-380 B.C. Objects are listed as being mostly "in the Heraion," a few "in Siphai," and a few "in Kreisus." Honorary Decree from Eleusis. - JoHN THREP- SIADES, in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 177-180, combines IG. ii2, 1974 and 1194, and an unpublished frag- ment in Eleusis to form a single decree. The man honored can now be identified as Euthy- demos, son of Moirokles, a member of a dis- tinguished Eleusinian family, the stemma of which is presented. Thessalian Goddess Enodia.- By correcting the published text of a Thessalian dedication, P. A. CLEMENT, in Hesp. viii, 1939, p. 200, recovers the name Ennodia Pheraia. This establishes the "Goddess of Pherai" as Enodia, a deity of the Hekate type, later assimilated as Artemis Enodia. Orchard of Herakles.-In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 380-409, M. LAUNEY publishes a contract for the rental of an orchard at Thasos (and other parcels of land?), with commentary on the preamble, on the land and its irrigation, on the disposal of refuse, on sacrifices and military participation, on buildings, on payments and guarantees. Inscription from Abdera.- In BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 51-54, J. BOUSQUET publishes a late inscrip- tion dedicating a pcxyapov - the word appears here for the first time in a Greek inscription- to "god Dionysos." Full commentary.</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 687 Olbian Inscription CIG. 2080. -In the Museum of the Society of Friends in Wilno occurs an in- scription engraved in seven lines on marble, measuring .22 m. x .26 m., a dedication to Achilles, which reads as follows: 'Ayaefit TOXip.

The new readings correct the earlier er- roneous copies, and the inscription is to be dated in the second century. ITALY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Prehistoric Finds near Amiata. -A list of spo- radic finds, chiefly stone and bronze implements and vases from sixteen places in the province of Grosseto. Vases of the Chalcolithic Period come from the Necropolis of Botro del Pelagone, from a tomb near Corano and from one near Poggio Formica. There is a pressing need for a systematic examination of the tombs of Corano and Poggia Formica, which doubtless will yield material for the study of the Chalcolithic Period in Etruria (A. MINTO, BPI. ii, 1938, pp. 29-43). Prehistoric Figurine from Jesi.- The author discusses a terracotta figurine, twenty-three cm. high, of pronounced ithyphallic type. It has a short, cylindrical body, protruding knobs for arms, facial features crudely represented, and lower limbs missing. It is somewhat akin to the figurine from Hagia Triada and to that of Tsangli. There is a remarkable scarcity of these male figurines as compared with the steatopygous fe- male type. They may have had some religious significance, as symbols of divine nature or merely as deities of fertility. This is a native product, not an importation (E. GALLI, BPI. ii, 1938, pp. 68-73). Culture of Isnello.- The material from two caves, Fico and Chiusella, excavated in 1891 and 1896, is regarded by Collini as belonging to Per. I (of Orsi), as late neolithic or transitional by Peet, while Cafici considers it transitional but belonging to a different group from that of Eastern Sicily and different from that of Western Sicily as represented in the finds from the Necropolis of Palermo. The Isnello material consists of bronze implements and four classes of sherds, large enough to indicate shapes. The author concludes that this culture is Chalcolithic and closely re- lated to northwestern Sicily, but has some affinity to eastern Sicily. These two distinct phases correspond to the two areas, NW and SE Sicily, and support the tradition of two ethnic groups in the island. The southeastern material shows east- ern Mediterranean influence, but the northwest- ern region was cut off by mountain barriers (A. Bovio MARCONI, BPI. ii, 1938, pp. 44-56). Terracotta Pyramids. - There are several terra- cotta pyramids in the Museum at Palermo, but two large ones, of unknown provenance, are of interest. They have an elaborate incised and stamped design (wavy lines, concentric circles, squares, etc.) which differs slightly on each of the four sides of the pyramid. The small holes in these heavy objects would not permit of sus- pension; nor are they like the usual type of weights. The author dates them between the eighth and the sixth century B.c. Three other small pyramids may have served as bases into which was set some slender object, possibly of bronze and of religious significance (I. BovIo MARCONI, BPI. ii, 1938, pp. 74-82). Location of Dripsinum.--The ancient Roman city of Dripsinum is probably to be located on the site of modern Trissino, northwest of Vicenza. Some of the epigraphical evidence which supports this identification is discussed by P. FRACCARO in Athenaeum xvii, 1939, pp. 171-177. Related Sicilian and Etruscan Monuments.-- GUIDo LIBERTINI (Rev. del R. Istit. d'Archeol. e Stor. dell' Arte vi, 1937, pp. 20-31) describes four small terracottas found at Centuripe, Sicily, which he dates IV-II B.C.: a funerary group of two seated figures analogous to a contemporary pair in relief from Viterbo; two busts similar to a female bust from the "Grotto of Isis" near Vulci (VII-VI B.C.); a standing figure comparable to another from Vulci. This last and the busts are closely related to Syro-Phoenician works. Hence he sees further evidence here of Syrian origins for Sicilian and Etruscan art, and of sub- sequent diffusion from that source through slave movements and Phoenician trading. Excavations at Apamaea.-In L'Ant. Class. viii, 1939, pp. 01-11, F. MAYENCE makes a</page><page sequence="17">688 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY provisional report on the 1937 campaign at Apamaea in Syria. In this, their sixth campaign, the Belgian archaeologists continued the work of clearing several buildings previously discovered, and commenced an examination of the cemetery. The rich architectural remains, late Roman in date, include a great basilica, a synagogue, and a theater. Numerous mosaics were uncovered. Palmyrene Boundary Inscriptions.-M. DAN- IEL SCHLUMBERGER'S discovery and study of three Palmyrene boundary inscriptions constitute a welcome addition to our knowledge of Pal- myrene-Roman relations (Syria xx, pp. 43-73). The boundary was fixed at Khirbet el-Bilaas (where two of the texts were found) between 11-17 A.D. and re-established there in 102 and again in December, 153. The boundary stone at Qasr el-Heir was erected under Hadrian or one of his successors. Tertullian on Costume.- The passages in Tertullian's De pallio, which refer to costume, are examined by C. ALBIZZATI in Athenaeum xvii, 1939, pp. 138-149. He discusses particularly those which throw light on the terminology used in connection with the toga, and those which are concerned with the manner of draping it. ARCHITECTURE Large Propylaea at Eleusis. - The entrance hall to the Eleusinian sanctuary has been attributed to the emperor Hadrian by Frazer (Pausanias ii, 105 f.) and Hekler (JOAI. 19/20, 1919, p. 232, no. 10; cf. pp. 229 ff.), or to Antoninus Pius by Dinsmoor (AJA. xiv, 1910, p. 155, note 1), Noack (Eleusis, p. 222), Kourouniotis (Guide to Eleusis 1934, pp. 24 and 31) and others. Dinsmoor and Kourouniotis saw already that the propylon had been finished by Marcus Aurelius, whose name appears in' the dedicatory inscription. OTFRIED DEUBNER (AM. 62, 1937, pp. 73-81, pls. 39-42) has recognized the fact that the whole building must be attributed to him. Although Hadrian and Antoninus were interested in the mysteries, the relationship of Marcus to Eleusis is a much closer one, as he was himself initiated into the mysteries, together with Commodus, under the assistance of his friend and teacher, Herodes Atticus. Moreover, the large medallion in the pediment of the entrance hall represents indeed Marcus, as DEUBNER has proved. An important detail is the giant on the shoulder strap, which recurs also on the bust of Marcus in the Louvre (pl. 492). This symbolizes his enemies, the bar- barian Marcomani, whom he defeated in 172/3. Marcus himself, with the head of Gorgo on his breast, is likened to Jupiter, who destroys the giants. The features of the face of the bust agree much more with Marcus than with Antoninus or Hadrian. We know already that Marcus had rebuilt the temple when it was destroyed in 170 A.D. by the Sarmatians. We know now that he also rebuilt the great propylaea. His portrait on a shield was put in the center of the entrance hall instead of apotropaic heads of Medusa, or shields with votive inscriptions or emblems, combining both in the imago clipeata. Such medallions were first used for the heads of gods and in the later imperial period for important personalities also. Lighthouse of Ostia.-Hermann Thiersch, Pharos, 1909, investigated the celebrated light- house of Alexandria, using all material available. Some of this and other reliefs on coins, architec- tural slabs, tombstones, sarcophagi, mosaics and lamps have been used by G. STUHLFAUTH (RM. 53, 1938, pp. 139-163, figs. 1-15, pl. 31) in order to reconstruct conclusively the monumental light- house erected by the emperor Claudius (41-54 A.D.) at Ostia. The lighthouse had four stories, built of large square stones. The three lower stories are square, the uppermost rounded. Each story recedes considerably against each lower one and each is lower than the one below it. A large vaulted entrance led into the lowest story, the two following had windows, while the upper- most was closed, because from it there issued the big fire to lighten up the entrance to the harbor at night. Thus Ostia had the first genuine lighthouse in the world, the three-storied pharos of Alex- andria being originally only a landmark in day- time. Though Alexandria gave the model for Ostia, a burning fire for night use was given to the pharos only after the one in Ostia had been erected. SCULPTURE Bona Dea.--A. GREIFENHAGEN in RM. 52, 1937, pp. 227-244, figs. 1-8, pls. 50-52, gives a list of representations of Bona Dea in statuettes and altars of the first and second century A.D. The name is given by inscriptions on a lost statuette and a lost fragment (no. 1, fig. 6 and no. 10). The type is that of a seated matron with a horn of plenty on her left arm, a snake around her right arm and a bowl from which the snake is fed in her right hand. Her temple was on the slope of the Aventine hill and she was venerated as a goddess of healing and of fertility</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 689 (Wissowa, Religion und Kultus der Rdmer, 2, pp. 216 ff.). This explains why she combines the attributes of the Greek Hygeia and Agathe Thea ('Ayaei1' e6&amp; or EE65, pl. 50, 2) or Agathe Tyche. The artistic model may have been Bona Fortuna (Agathe Tyche) by Praxiteles, on the Capitoline hill (Pliny 36, 23). This statue stood, together with the Bonus Eventus (Agathos Daimon) of the same artist, which may have been the model for the genius, represented together with Bona Dea on the altar in Naples, pl. 51. Statuette of a Pantheress.-R. HEIDENREICH in RM. 52, 1937, pp. 266-274, pl. 39, discusses a pantheress published by Curtius in Pantheon 1936, pp. 147 ff., now in the Bliss Collection at Washington (Masterbronzes from Collections in America, no. 97). HEIDENREICH dates the original ca. 400 B.c. and assumes the bronze is a copy from a group on a column over the tomb of the courtesan Lais at Corinth, represented on coins (p. 269, figs. 1-5). This would account for the peculiar movement of the legs, as on the tomb- stone a ram is harassed by the animal. Pausanias ii, 2, 4 describes the animal on the tomb of Lais as a lioness, but the coins are in favor of the interpretation of HEIDENREICH as a pantheress. A Roman "Trimalchio" had the queer idea to have a copy of the tombstone of a courtesan made into a gargoyle for pouring wine. Portraits of Roman Boys. - GOFFREDO RICCI in RM. 52, 1937, pp. 256-60, publishes three heads of children discovered at Ostia, the harbor town of Rome. One (figs. 1-2) is the head of a sickly infant of the Julio-Claudian period. The second (pl. 55) is the statuette of a robust baby of the Trajan period. The third (pl. 56) is the head of a young boy from the fourth century A.D. Each is a masterpiece of its period and of Roman art in portraying children. Venus from Aenona. - In Athenaeum xvii, 1939, pp. 50-53, E. GALLI describes a statue of Venus found at Nin, the ancient Aenona, in Dalmatia. It is a Roman copy of a common Hellenistic type, with the lower part of the figure draped and a small Silen standing by the left leg. An inscrip- tion of the second-third centuries A.D., found with the group identifies it as a dedication to Venus Ansotica. The epithet, hitherto unre- corded, is probably a local Illyrian one. Spurious "Trajanic" Relief.- The relief from Terracina, thought to represent the building of a lighthouse by Trajan, is not antique, according to W. H. GRoss (AA. 1938, cols. 148-155). Signs of spuriousness: the touch of anachronistic carica- ture in the workmen, the flabby drapery, the feeble repetition of types, the namby-pamby attitudes of certain bystanders, the "high renais- sance" posturing of Trajan, a solecism in his costume. Fragment from Column of Marcus Aurelius. - The base of the Aurelian column has been mu- tilated and denuded of its outer casing. Drawings of the Renaissance show, however, on the fourth course above the entrance side the homage of two vanquished Germans to the emperor. H. FUHRMANN in RM. 52, 1937, pp. 261-65 has recognized in a fragment in the Museo Nazionale Romano the left-hand part with the head of the last and the shoulder of the first chief, against shields in the background, which belong to the soldiers guarding the kneeling chiefs, all agreeing with the prints of Piranesi and Enea Vica (pls. 57-58). Art of the Age of Diocletian.- This period is dealt with in two articles in RM. 53, 1938, by L'ORANGE, pp. 1-34 and by FUHRMANN, pp. 35-45. The most important monument of Diocletianic sculpture is the base in the Roman Forum, commemorating the triumph of Diocletian and his colleagues in 303/4 A.D. It is called the Decennalia basis, from the inscription on its rear side: Caesarum decennalia feliciter (CIL. vi, 1204; L'ORANGE, fig. 1 and pl. I), on a shield carried by two victories and surrounded by pris- oners and trophies. The front side (figs. 3 and 6, pl. 3) represents a sacrifice of an emperor, crowned by Victory and the genius of the senate, attended by a flute-player, a priest and a camillus. Present are Mars and Roma, who is unveiling herself from a cloak, the folds of which reveal the head of Sol-Mithras, thus representing the sky. According to L'ORANGE, the sacrifice is performed by Con- stantius Chlorus. It is taking place on the Campus Martius and was combined with the lustratio, indicated by the animals of the suovetaurilia on the left side (fig. 2 and pl. 2) and the procession of four togati, accompanied by a boy and four officers carrying signa with clipei votivi (figs. 4 and 7, pl. 4). These are the Caesares of the triarchy, who celebrated the vicennalia Augustorum and the decennalia Caesarum in 303. The signa relate to the formations of the emperors Diocletian, Max- imianus and of the Caesares Galerius and Con- stantius Chlorus. This base was one of five, of which two more have been discovered in previous times (pp. 20 if.), one with the inscription Augus-</page><page sequence="19">690 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY torum vicennalia, the other with the inscription vicennalia Imperatorum (fig. 8). This must have been the one in the center, while the two others must have had lost counterparts for the other emperor and the other Ceasar. Such a monument of five Corinthian columns, with the statue of Jupiter in the center, the statues of the emperors and Caesars on the others is represented as a back- ground to the "oratio of Constantine on the rostra," in the relief on the arch of Constantine (fig. 9; cf. L'ORANGE, Der spdtantike Bildschmuck des Konstantinsbogens, pp. 81 ff., pls. 5 a, 14 b, 15 a, 91 c and d). The statue of Jupiter reappears on contemporary coins (pl. 8, 4). Thus L'ORANGE sketches a reconstruction of the entire monument (fig. 12), with Jupiter on the central column, the two emperors on the columns at the sides and the two Caesares on the columns to the extreme right and left. The importance of the monument for the history of art L'ORANGE has already pointed out in his former study: Der spdtantike Bild- schmuck des Konstantinsbogens, pp. 207 ff. To his bibliography, p. 1, note 1, there is to be added: E. Strong, Art in Ancient Rome ii, p. 178. FUHRMANN discusses the portraits of Diocletian. We have definite likenesses on his coins (pl. 8, no. I and 6), in an imago clipeata in his mausoleum at Spalato and two porphyry reliefs in the Vatican and at San Marco in Venice (L'ORANGE, Studien zur Geschichte des spdtantiken Portrdits, pp. 16 ff., figs. 32-35 and 39. Delbriick, Ant. Porphyrwerke, pls. 32-36). A togatus in Villa Doria Pamphili has been identified as Diocletian by L'ORANGE (RM. 44, 1929, pp. 180 ff., pls. 37-39). This is now justified by a newly identified portrait on a herm, formerly in the possession of the Danish sculptor Jerichau (figs. 1-9), which is similar to the head of a statue in the Villa Doria Pamphili (fig. 3). Both are very massive and square, in the style of the period ca. 300 A.D. The head once owned by Jerichau is combined in a double herm with a head of Kronos-Saturnus (fig. 4). This combina- tion alludes to the golden age, which Diocletian - as before him Augustus and other emperors- were supposed to bring to the Roman empire. Late Roman Portrait.- A. M. SCHNEIDER pub- lishes a marble bust exhibited in the entrance hall of the Byzantine Museum at Athens, in AM. 692, 1937, pp. 70-72, pl. 38. It represents ICBAPDIA, a peculiar name which is neither Greek nor Semitic. It is a half bust, in the style of the fourth century A.D., neglecting the body in favor of the dress. The mantle is drawn over the head, and on top of it is a kind of torque and still above this an olive wreath. The bust is said to have been found at Smyrna. It may be the portrait of a priestess of one of the many mystery cults in this city. INSCRIPTIONS Epigraphical Evidence on C. Marius.-In an attempt to throw light on the career of Gaius Marius, A. PASSERINI (Athenaeum xvii, 1939, pp. 54-77) makes a detailed examination of the fol- lowing inscriptions: CIL. i2, XVII and XVIII; SEG. iii, 378, p. 78; Inscriptiones Italiae xiii, 3, 7; CIL. iii, 7941; IG. xiv, 1997. Official Rescript from Corinth. - OSCAR BRON- EER, in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 181-190, publishes a fragment of a rescript, apparently from a Gov- ernor of Achaea of the first century A.D. By com- parison with an inscription from the Isthmia, IG. iv, 203, this fragment is shown to refer to the plan of P. Licinius Priscus, a local aedile, to erect buildings at the Isthmia in fulfilment of campaign promises. The prescript gives him permission to buy sacred land on which to build. The Priests of Panamara. -In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 936-998, A. LAUMONIER lists in order 172 priests with complete details, including extensive genealogical tables. All but seven priesthoods date from the period of the Roman Empire. Com- plementary notes, BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 167-179. Latin Inscriptions from Philippi. - In BCH. lxi, 1937, pp. 410-420, P. LEMERLE publishes 16 new texts; index of names. Dedication of 202 A.D. from Philippi.-A pentapolis, hitherto unknown, Hadrianopolis, (B)e(r)ga, Skimbertos, Gazaros, and ( ------- ), commemorate a sacrifice to the imperial house. Hadrianopolis and Skimbertos are cities new to us (J. ROGER in BCH. lxii, 1938, pp. 37-41). NUMISMATICS Dura.- The eighth and ninth Dura hoards are studied by A. R. BELLINGER in NNM. 85. Though found at different times, they belong together and are so treated. The hoard seems to have been assembled about 909 A.D., but contains several much worn pieces of an earlier date, and runs to about 250 A.D. There is a wide diversity of mints, from cities of Pontus in the north to Cyprus and Syro-Phoenicia in the west. Impor- tant types are the Tyche of Antioch, the pyre of Amasia, and the tetrastyle temple of Neo-Caes- area. There are 396 bronze pieces mostly of the large size.</page><page sequence="20">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 691 Roman Tetradrachms. -HENRI SEYRIG (Syria xx, pp. 39-49) shows that a group of tetra- drachms from the reigns of Tiberius and Nero comes from Latakia and that the abbreviation IAN, found on some of them, stands for Sandan, a magistrate whose name is based on that of the chief god of the city. Another group of tetra- drachms, characterized by a crab and crescent, comes from Gabala, because one such coin (p. 41) has the additional symbol of the date-palm, which, according to Seyrig, is appropriate to Gabala. EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE Abbey of St. Mary.- While digging a trench down the Kidron Valley for a new Jerusalem sewer, two superimposed pavements were brought to light a short distance to the west of the Church of the Tomb of the Virgin. The lower mosaic pavement can be dated by a tombstone to the sixth century A.D. and probably belonged to a Byzantine monastery. The upper pavement is definitely Crusader work, as is proved by the dressing of the stones and other architectural details. The mosaic border is of a mixed composi- tion, such as is found in the neighboring Cru- sader church at Gethsemane and in the north arm of the crypt of the Church of the Tomb of the Virgin. Evidently the Crusaders made use of materials from an earlier Byzantine structure. The position of the recently discovered upper pavement and its date make it practically cer- tain that it is a part of the great Abbey of St. Mary in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which we know was erected by the Crusaders in the twelfth century beside the Church of the Tomb of the Virgin. Combining the scanty material evidence with a respect for the limitations imposed by the topography of the site, C. N. JOHNS presents us with a conjectural restoration of the plan of the abbey (QDAP. viii, pp. 117-136). The Sarcophagus of Sidamara. - G. W. ELDER- KIN, in Hesp. viii, 1939, pp. 105-115, traces the type to an Athenian original of the fourth century B.C. The figures on the front represent the de- ceased person, the Spartan underworld triad of Helen and the Dioscuri, and Artemis, who is associated with them. The original may have been ordered from Athens by a person of Spartan descent living in southern Asia Minor. Churches at Bosra and Samaria-Sebaste.- J. W. CROWFOOT in JHS. lix, 1939, p. 139, cor- rects an error made by the reviewer, J. M. R. Cormack in JHS. Iviii, 1938, p. 287, of Crow- foot's book dealing with churches at Bosra and Samaria-Sebaste, to the effect that at Bosra there was no trace of any composite pier, the base of which Butler was said to have found in 1909. Byzantine Pottery.-D. TALBOT RICE calls attention in JHS. lix, 1939, pp. 138-139, to an article in A rs Islamica v, pp. 55-86, 1938, by Miss du Platt Taylor on "Mediaeval Graves in Cyprus," in which a large quantity of late Byzan- tine pottery is published, dating in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. MEDIAEVAL Eleventh-Century French Sculpture.--HENRI FOCILLON (BullMon. 97, 1938, pp. 49-79) briefly surveys eleventh-century sculpture in northern France, emphasizing the importance of the schools of the Loire Valley and Normandy. The style- peak of this period, represented here by the rond- point capitals of Morienval, arose from roots in Spain and Ottonian Germany and developed in such centers as Dijon, Paris, Orleans, Angers, Lavardan and Le Mans. Norman and Catalan influences he considers as inseparable problems, but he does not discuss them here. RENAISSANCE Lost Painting by Hans Baldung.- A collection of woodcuts of famous men by Bernhard Jobin (Strassburg, 1587) includes a portrait of Jacob Sturm, a leading figure in Strassburg. CARL KOCH (MJb. xiii, 1938-39, pp. 107-13) regards this, and a portrait by a Strassburg master done after Sturm's death, as based on a lost painting by Hans Baldung. Both works show characteristics of Baldung's style. Le Nain Forge of Vulcan.-In the Chateau d'Effiat is a painting of the Forge of Vulcan, traditionally attributed to Mathieu and Louis Le Nain, but not previously mentioned in literature on the Le Nain. This attribution seems actually to be correct on the basis of comparison with a sim- ilar subject in the Rheims Museum. PIERRE DU COLOMBIER, in GBA. 1939, pp. 30-38, concludes with a discussion of the iconography of the scene and its representation in art. Michelangelo's Descent from the Cross.-In Dawna Sztuka ii, pp. 111-120, KAROLINA LANCK- ORONSKA discusses the Descent from the Cross of Michelangelo. This group was made between 1547 and 1555 and shows that influence of mediaeval Italian art, which was so often felt in the later</page><page sequence="21">692 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY works of the artist. The sculptor underwent certain religious moods, which are reflected in the work. It is especially to be noted that Nicodemus has the features of the sculptor and this tradition was continued later by Caravaggio, who gave to Nicodemus in the Laying in the Coffin the features of Michelangelo. Tadeusz Kuntze.-In Dawna Sztuka ii, pp. 191-130, MACIEJ LORET discusses the ability of Tadeusz Kuntze in Rome. He adds to the pictures hitherto known the panels in the Hall of Do- miniquin in the Gallery Borghese, in one of which the artist represented two Polish musicians. It is very probable that panels in other halls are also his work, but this cannot be decided definitely. The Work of Giacomo Amato.-LUIGI BIAGI (L'Arte, N.S. 10, 1939, pp. 29-48) reviews six- teenth-century architecture at Palermo, to clarify the local influences which tempered Giacomo Amato's work. The architect's work at Rome and Palermo is historically and aesthetically criticized. FAR EAST Musulman or Iranian Art.-In Rev. des Arts Asiat. xii, pp. 20-31, EUSTACHE DE LOREY takes issue with the theory of Ivan Stouchine concern- ing the origins of and the influences on Abbassid painting in Iran. De Lorey claims that the style is not completely homogeneous and not mainly dependent upon Sassanian art. He shows the im- portance of Islamic culture and points to stylistic affinities between the art of Central Asia and that of Iran under the Abbassids. Afghanistan.-In Rev. des Arts Asiat. xii, pp. 2-11, J. HACKIN summarizes the activities of the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan for the season September 1936-August 1937. Work was mainly done at Begran, the ancient Kaptsi, and in the district of Chakansur, ancient Seistan. The more important monuments dis- covered are described and dated with reference to existing material. Painting in East Turkestan.-In Ostasiat. Zeitschr. 14, 1939, p. 83, DENES SINoR makes a comparison of various features of paintings from Turfan, now in the Museum fiir Vdlkerkunde, Berlin, with literary sources and seeks to date the paintings in the Mongolian period, i.e., after 1209, and thus prove his contention that the period of Buddhistic painting in East Turkestan extended considerably beyond the chronological limits now accepted. He arrives at his conclusion by a com- parison of clothing, coiffure, and proportions of the figures, with descriptions of Mongolians given by two travellers, Johann de Piano Carpini and Wilhelm von Rubruk, who visited Mongolia be- tween 1245 and 1255. Chinese Sculpture.-In Ostasiat. Zeitschr. 14, 1939, p. 65, LUDWIG BACHHOFER seeks to throw some light upon the history of Chinese sculpture from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries. Owing to the extreme scarcity of dated monu- ments, this period has always presented many problems. Attention is called to the chief ques- tions involved, a few of them are studied in detail, and some attempt is made to show an orderly development of style. In particular the author discusses five wooden seated figures brought to Japan from China in 847 and now in Toji, Kyoto. U.S.S.R. Archaeology in 1938.-The Institute of the History of Material Culture of the Academy of Sciences, U.S.S.R., publishes in its first Report a survey of archaeological explorations made in 1938 in the U.S.S.R. The most important results are: studies of the cities of the Crimean Bosporus before the Greek settlements in the sixth century, B.c., studies of a Central Asian culture perhaps centering at Khoresm, which seems widespread and distinct from the Iranian culture, and studies of the three settlements which were later com- bined to form the city of Kiev. Sovietskaya Arkheologiya.- The first archaeo- logical journal of post-tsarist Russia began with its very promising No. i, 1936, 305 pp., and was followed in due time by No. ii, 1937, 243 pp., which shows a material improvement over the initial volume. The "Soviet Archaeology" is published by the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, Institute for Anthropology, Archaeology, and Ethnography. Both volumes open with extensive editorials on aims, tasks, and statements of policy. While a great deal of what is said on behalf of tasks and aims and in the way of criticism con- cerning past and present methods in Russia and elsewhere is justified, there is much to be taken cum grano salis. To blame bourgeois methods for atrocities committed on kurgans will hardly im- press those who are aware of the existing deplora- ble field procedure of some archaeologists in Russia. Especially striking, if not obnoxious, is the insistence (II: 1-15 sic!) on a scrupulous ap- plication of and obedience to "the Marxist-Lenin- istic method." Apparently, it should be consid-</page><page sequence="22">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 693 ered either treason or sacrilege for a "scientist" in Russia not to respect and revere this "method" which, incidentally, is not even explained. Yet it' seems that the editors are not without an objec- tive appreciation of the scope of archaeology as a historical discipline. Above all, however, the reader finds relief from the obviously tinted edi- torials in the individual original contributions, reports, the extensive chronicles listing current field work and discoveries, and reviews. It will please many, no doubt, to find a French resume accompanying all original contributions and materialia. (Incidentally, it is only these two categories of articles that are summarized here on this occasion. The chronicles contain appall- ing numbers of events which could not very well be abstracted without taking undue space.) The paper, so often a discouraging feature in recent Russian publications, is good, and so are the il- lustrations, which have improved with the second volume. Rock Drawings At Lake Onyega. - In ibid. pp. 9 ff., V. I. RAVDONIKAs describes the long known, but hitherto very little published rock drawings found in North Russia. They were executed with stone tools, by a technique combining initial pecking followed by furrowing, and date from the Neolithic period, as suggested by settlement sites explored in the immediate vicinity. The drawings include figures of birds, quadrupeds, man, and also certain presumably symbolic representations. They serve as an aid in reconstructing the ecologic, economic, and social conditions of their original makers. The variety of composition induces the author to think that the drawings represent differ- ent periods of "social thinking" and he concludes that an analysis of such periods, or "palaeontol- ogy of thinking" (p. 46), will open the way for a proper study and evaluation of rock drawings. Pottery Making Technique. -In ibid. pp. 51 ff., M. E. VOEVODSKIJ, despite a cumbrous title, offers a valuable treatise, quite objectively moti- vated, on a subject heretofore sadly neglected not only in Russia, but in the Old World in gen- eral. The author's chief concern centers on the so- called "pitted and combed" pottery (a misnomer) which has a wide distribution in the northerly zone of Russia in Europe, in Siberia, and also in the woodland area of North America (as yet, however, unknown in Alaska and in the Macken- zie region). Inasmuch as the true state of relation- ship and the question of chronology regarding the many links in this vast geographic span are very little known thus far, a technical study contribut- ing reliable, objectively determined tectonic and other technologic details is, of course, most wel- come. Voevodskij has done very well indeed in his approach to the subject by dealing only with the Neolithic material. He recognizes only one tech- nique of construction as commonly and con- stantly typical. This implies segmental construc- tion on the course of a continuous spiral which depended on tectonic components in the shape of fillets-in the case under review 6 cm. to 9 cm. long. The described and illustrated criteria are convincing enough to establish the practice of true coiling at the various sites which supplied the author's study sherds. It will be interesting to know whether or not the annular variants (cir- cuit, ring) or the laminated moulding construc- tion identified in America (cf. Amer. Antiq. iii, 1937, pp. 143 ff.) also existed in the Old World. Especially instructive are the so-called "combs" of stone and bone-in reality stamping tools- used for the execution of the impressed decora- tion. In America only one such tool, of stone, has been recorded (cf. Amer. Antiq., ibid.). The Treasure of Podcharema.-In Sov. Arkh. ii, 1937, pp. 113 ff., V. A. GORODTSOV describes a treasure accidentally discovered by a geology student in 1929, in the far northeastern corner of European Russia. The find, comprising some seventy well preserved specimens, is now in the Hermitage Museum. The author divides the ma- terial into two categories: domestic and cult ob- jects. The first group comprises chiefly articles of adornment and general utility; the cult objects consist of animal figures, plaques with portrayals of mythical creatures, symbolic presentations, etc. Local as well as Persian elements are obvious in the motifs; Sassanian details are particularly striking. Gorodtsov dates the treasure as of the beginning of the 4th century, approximately cor- responding with the reign of the Sassanian king Hormusdas, i.e., 303-309. Kurgans at Kuznetsovka (Moscow Region). - In Sov. Arkh. i, 1936, pp. 247 ff., S. V. KISELEV describes his excavations in ten tumuli situated northward of Moscow. The earthen accumulation varied in height from 0.5 m. to 1 m., and in basal diameter from 6 m. to 9.5 m. The graves contained skeletal burials, placed in elongated pits and ac- companied by ceramic and metal furniture. The constant orientation of the skeleton from east to west, the funerary arrangement, as well as the furniture, clearly bespeak a Slavic provenience.</page><page sequence="23">694 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY The author suggests the Krivitchi and Viatitchi, who are recorded to have occupied this area during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Microlithic Station at Urtuya.-In ibid. pp. 105 ff., V. A. GORODTSOV gives a brief report on the discovery of a site in the Amur River Basin and the results of its initial exploration. The lithic finds comprise a series of thumb and blade scrap- ers, triangular projectile points, knives and grav- ers of blades, as well as core pieces. On the whole, the various types are closely reminiscent of the more or less standard Western European types characteristic of the Microlithic industry. The Cemetery at Likhatchevo. -In Sov. Arkh. ii, 1937, pp. 19 ff., O. N. BADER discusses the finds from the "gorodishte" and cemetery of Likhatchevo, region Kalinin (old Tver), origi- nally obtained by Makarenko in 1903. The ceme- tery was located within the roughly oval strong- hold surrounded by two embankments and two ditches. Makarenko opened six graves. A re-ex- amination of his finds, which were inadequately published by him in 1904, has enabled Bader to reach several interesting deductions. The site be- longs to the Fatiyanovo phase of the Bronze Age. The material remains furnish important light on the economic status of the aborigines, who had agriculture and domesticated animals, and who apparently added to their food supply by hunting reindeer. The physical environment had changed from forest to grass land, and thus facilitated the establishment of a sedentary economy which did not develop fully until the Bronze Age proper (i.e. the Fatiyanovo phase). Neolithic Fish Weirs. - In ibid. pp. 61 ff., V. V. FEDOROV re-examines the finds of wooden posts, originally made by Polyakov in 1878 (published 1882). The posts are said to have been found partially in their aboriginal position, apparently forming a circle. Polyakov also found fish bones within the circle and concluded that the contrap- tion was originally used as a fish weir. Kiselev upholds this view, and having further studied the terrain, where he found traces of a Neolithic set- tlement, and having done some inductive experi- ments in dressing wooden posts with stone tools, assigns the weir definitely to the New Stone Age. He adds several germane comparisons of fish trap and weir construction still practiced among contemporary aborigines in various parts of the world. Western Volga Region in First Millennium A. D. -In ibid. pp. 39 fF., P. P. EFIMENKO publishes a brief summary of his large work, now in prog- ress, dealing with the area between the Volga, Don, and Oka. In the present article, his chief emphasis is on cemeteries. During the first half of the millennium, the author envisions a pastoral rather than an agricultural economic basis. The latter half, in his opinion, marks the presence of strictly agricultural settlers. Definite Slavic occupation of the area is not documented until the eleventh century. Crimean Expedition, 1935.-In Sov. Arkh. i, 1936, pp. 195 ff., C. N. RIBIKOV deals with the exploration of the rock shelter of Shai-Koba, situated in the Baidar river valley, Crimea. Three cultural niveaus were found: (I) The top layer with humus, containing Bronze Age mate- rial with typical pottery; (II) Levels 2 and 3, forming a complex, and characterized by Tar- denoisian flint industry; (III) Levels 4, 5, and 6, again a distinct complex, with either ancient Tardenoisian or Azilian flint industry. The nature of the several depositional horizons was such as to permit precise following of the individual levels. In addition to a large number of representative flint and bone specimens, which help to recon- struct the activities of the aborigines, the site yielded valuable ecologic and economic evidence in large quantities of snail shells (Helix vulgaris) which were used for food. Date of Scythian Tumuli. -In ibid. pp. 79 ff., B. RABINOVITCH re-examines the evidence which originally induced Rostovtzeff to date the tumuli in the Middle Dnieper region in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. The author, basing his deductions on the mode of the funerary customs, and espe- cially on types of mirrors and other furniture, comes to the conclusion that at least some of the sepulchral kurgans of the Scythian period on the Middle Dnieper go as far back as the sixth century B.C. Cemetery on Kuban River.-In ibid. pp. 159 ff., M. V. POKROVSKIJ reports the chance finds made in the process of clay cutting for the manu- facture of bricks. The Pashkovskaya material consists of brooches, a mirror, a bracelet, a neck- lace, individual beads, and pottery. Most of these specimens suggest a close affinity with Gothic grave finds in the Crimea, and the author dates them into the 5th and 6th centuries. It appears that a settlement may have existed at the site during the first and second centuries. Pokrovskij intends to investigate the locality further in order to be able to reach more conclusive deductions.</page><page sequence="24">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 695 Excavations at Ielizavetinskaya, 1935. - In ibid. pp. 171 ff., V. A. GORODTSOV gives a preliminary report of the explorations of the "gorodichte" and cemetery of lelizavetinskaya, near Krasnodar, which began in 1934. The stronghold contains well preserved fortification features and remnants of habitations which attest the former existence of rectangular houses (dimensions about 5.5 m. by 7 m. in ground plan). The deposits are rich in arti- facts of metals, bone, stone, and pottery, as well as in animal bones. The artifacts represent articles of personal adornment, agricultural and industrial implements, and weapons; twenty-two Panti- capaean coins are reported to have been found. Particularly interesting are the remnants of baking ovens, originally constructed of clay, which apparently have been so well preserved as to permit detailed reconstruction. In the ceme- tery, ninety-five burials have been excavated thus far. They are invariably skeletal, and con- tain chiefly metal and ceramic furniture. No de- tails are given in the preliminary report. A chariot burial of a warrior had with it a Panathenaic amphora which the author dates about 425 B.C. Ethnically, the Sarmatians are suggested; indeed, Gorodtsov deduces this stock from the skeletal remains alone. Excavations in the Tumulus Field at "Three Brothers."-In ibid. pp. 115 ff., P. S. RIKOV de- scribes the work and finds of the 1933 and 1934 excavations at "Three Brothers," at which time two of the four groups of tumuli were explored. The individual mounds varied in size from small rises to as much as a height of 5 m. and even 7 m., and in base diameter they attained an extreme of 65 m. They represented several periods of culture history. The oldest dated from the Bronze Age and contained well preserved pottery analogous with the Khvalinsk ware. The Sarmatian graves of the 2nd and 3rd centuries have yielded espe- cially instructive material regarding distant trade contacts. In addition to sundry burials of the nomads of the 11th and 12th centuries, there were also interments of 14th century Mongols. It appears that the Kalmik steppe region may be expected to reveal a very interesting archaeologi- cal history. Cemetery at Ananino (Tatar Republic). -In Sov. Arkh. ii, 1937, pp. 95 ff., A. V. ZBRUEVA re- ports the results of his recent excavations in the well known cemetery which first commanded the attention of archaeologists as early as 1858. The site is situated upon a dune which has suffered much seasonal erosion by the Kama river. Zbrueva found one intact grave with a male skeletal burial in an elongated pit; the furniture included a socketed bronze celt (hexagonal), a lance head and a knife blade of iron, a bronze spiral, a bronze torque, and two femurs of a horse. This grave belongs to the so-called Ananino phase of the Middle Iron Age, which Tallgren dates between the seventh and second centuries B.C. Zbrueva also found a hitherto unnoticed deposit containing sherds which suggest the possibility of an earlier, perhaps Neolithic, settlement. Fish Images of Stone.--In Soy. Arkh. i, 1936, pp. 215 ff., A. P. OKLADNIKOv describes the recent archaeological investigations in Neolithic sites of Eastern Siberia and the Baikal region. This work resulted in the collecting of many stone figurines, both anthropomorphic and theriomor- phic, among which the fish is particularly numer- ous. The individual specimens, 18 cm. to 95 cm. long, are quite realistically executed, and repre- sent the local varieties of fish. The author con- siders various possibilities in so far as their origi- nal function is concerned, and concludes that they were most likely used in actual fishing, as is still the case with some contemporary aborigines of Siberia. Tumuli at Sida and Tesi, Minusinsk. - In Soy. Arkh. ii, 1937, pp. 71 ff., S. V. KISELEv describes his recent finds in twelve sepulchral tumuli on the middle Yenisei river. They represent the so- called Afanasievo phase of the Bronze Age, which the author dates in the third millennium. The individual graves contained from one to eight skeletons, invariably contracted; their covering heaps had a diameter of 7 m. to II m., and a height of 0.5 m. to 0.8 m. The funerary furniture was rather poor, except for pottery, of which a fine series of representative specimens was ob- tained. The author sees close analogies for his finds in the Altai area and also in Kazakstan. V. J. FEWKES</page><page sequence="25">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS In these days when wartime restrictions will undoubtedly cause a lessening, if not a complete cessation of archaeological activities in Greece, it is encouraging to look back over this past year with its unusually rich succession of important finds from all regions of the country. Beginning with the stunning bronzes of the autumn cam- paign at Olympia,' followed by the 620 inscribed tablets found in Nestor's Palace at Pylos in the early spring,2 came the sensational discoveries made by the French School at Delphi the follow- ing month, which were succeeded again by the Swedish Expedition's opening of an undisturbed Royal Chamber Tomb at Dendra and the clearing of another rich Mycenaean tomb,3 this time in Athens itself, by the excavators of the Athenian Agora. This latter proved to be a chamber tomb of the fourteenth century, cut in the rock of the Areopagus, with much of its contents intact be- cause of an early collapse of the roof. Later in the summer a renewal of the excavations at Mycenae by the British School after many years, brought to light much new information about the Treasury of Atreus and also produced some very fine carved ivories. The cleaning of the gold and ivory objects found at Delphi is being carried out in Athens,4 and as a result more detailed descriptions may now be given of the finds. Among them were the remains of three life-sized chryselephantine statues and five smaller ones. The heads, hands and feet were of ivory and although damaged by fire and its long burial in the earth, the ivory is well enough preserved to show the fine workmanship and to enable the excavators to assign one of the bigger heads to the Ionian School of sculpture of the first half of the sixth century. The ornaments of the statues were of pure gold and thus are perfectly preserved. There are long locks of wavy hair, diadems, earrings, girdles and rosettes, and two plaques, 35 cm. high, which were fastened to the front of the dress to represent the embroidered panels. These are divided into eight reliefs with 1 See AJA. xliii, pp. 336-340. 2 See ibid., p. 340; pp. 557 if. 3Ibid., pp. 577 ff. 4 This work was begun by Gillibron, but was still unfinished at the time of his sudden death late in the summer. Eastern motifs, such as griffins, sphinxes, lions, deer, wild goats, gorgons and Pegasus. Like the ivory heads, they are of Ionian style, and of the same period. In addition to these, there is an abundant collection of little ivory figurines, decorations for a small coffer or, perhaps, the arms of a throne. The figures apparently belong to battle scenes. Among these works of the archaic period were bronzes dating from 480 to 450, notably a perfume-burner supported by a statuette of a woman wearing a peplos, one of the finest examples of classical sculpture before Phidias. This is the first instance of the finding of chryselephantine statues and its importance cannot be overestimated. At Dendra during May and June the Swedish Expedition cleared five chamber tombs. The first of these to be opened had been plundered in antiquity, but its central cist was untouched and from it was recovered a fine collection of bronzes. In the second tomb a skeleton was found in its original position in the centre of the chamber, with remains of its wooden coffin, or bier, around it. At the foot was a bronze helmet, the first Mycenaean one so far recovered; beside the dead man was a fine gold-mounted dagger and a sealstone and Palace Style jars stood nearby. The third tomb had been completely plundered, but in the fifth some beautiful pottery was found. The fourth tomb, however, proved to be the largest chamber tomb of its period thus far excavated, and because of the early collapse of the roof it had remained unplundered. It lies very near the Royal Tomb excavated in 1926 and Professor Persson calls this the Queen's Tomb, as no weap- ons were found in it and a great abundance of gold jewellery was recovered. In two small pits near the rear wall there were quantities of ashes and charred matter. The smaller one contained a beautiful gold cup, with a band of interlocking heart-shaped leaves, executed in repouss6 around the circumference. The rim of the cup is scal- loped and decorated with beading, as is the curved loop handle. Other finds included a gold signet ring with a sacrificial scene showing an altar and two female figures; eight large gold rosettes, 2Y8 in. in diameter, which evidently decorated a leather belt; two large circular pendants with a central disc swung on a gold 696 THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA</page><page sequence="26">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 697 wire; more than two hundred gold necklace ornaments; more than a thousand beads of glass paste and one hundred of amber. There were also objects of ivory which have not yet been cleaned and two fine sealstones. The second pit appeared to be wholly reserved for burial gifts and contained five silver vases, two of which showed gold inlay on the rim, a third contained a silver spoon, another a small silver box, while the fifth was a crater in shape and measured 104 in. in diameter. There was also a shallow ivory bowl lined with gold leaf. The pottery found in this tomb appears to make it earlier in time than the King's Tomb found in 1926, perhaps 1400 B.c. in date. "The excavations at Mycenae in 1939 were directed principally to four points, the ruins of the Greek temple on the summit and a large Mycenaean house on the east side of the Acro- polis, an area outside the Lion Gate, and the Treas- ury of Atreus. "The foundations of the Greek temple were cleared, surveyed, and studied in detail. As they survive today they are certainly of the Hellenistic period and it is clear that neither the Hellenistic sanctuary nor any earlier temple that preceded it had a peristyle. Blocks from earlier structures had been built into the foundations and all round a great variety of tiles from early archaic to Hel- lenistic times was found. Pottery found below the surface of the northern terrace of the temple area shows that a sanctuary had existed throughout "Geometric" times and the tiles and architec- tural fragments indicate that it was succeeded by an early archaic shrine. The temple, with the massive substructures which supported it on the north, lies south and north and it is possible that it owes this abnormal orientation to the fact that it overlies the shrine of the Mycenaean palace which faced south. It now seems that the early archaic sculpture in relief previously found did not belong to a temple, but since it was all found in the southern part of the temple area, may have belonged to some structure, perhaps an altar, which stood before the south front of the sanctuary. "At the foot of the north terrace, which is over three metres high, a ledge on the brink of the steep rock was cleared. Here on the very edge is part of a thick wall which, since it is connected with a deep M.H. deposit, is probably the remains of the earlier fortification wall of the acropolis which preceded the L.H. cyclopean walls. Above the M.H. stratum were the ruins of two Mycenaean rooms and in these was found a rich series of ob- jects, which included fragments of stucco altars and terracotta figurines and may have come from the Mycenaean shrine above. Foremost is a unique group carved in ivory completely in the round, representing two sitting women with a child standing before them at its mother's knee (fig. 1). This group is the best Mycenaean ivory yet found and in style, in preservation, and in artistic and archaeological value has no rival. Other notable pieces are the head of a statuette in painted plaster, several gold ornaments, a cylinder seal, perhaps Hurrian, and many beads in glass and faience, including a lantern bead. "The House of Columns on a broad terrace on the east side of the citadel, which was excavated by Tsountas in 1895 but never published, was re-cleared and planned. The centre is occupied by a colonnaded court with a cement pavement. In the northern part is a megaron, opening on the court by a porch with two large column-bases. The southern part was built above an extensive basement approached by a descending ramp. In one basement room was a series of pithoi, large and small, and in another the fragments of many large stirrup jars, two of which are inscribed. The house is remarkably well built, with massive walls and thresholds of conglomerate and is architec- turally most interesting as being the only large Mycenaean house not a palace yet found. It is probably contemporary with the large megaron and court at Tiryns and was apparently inhabited right up to the burning of Mycenae in the twelfth century. "To the west of the Lion Gate, outside the cy- clopean walls and just north of the Grave Circle, the Granary, and adjoining buildings within the walls, an area which Tsountas had partly cleared was completely excavated. Here in a compara- tively small space were found fifteen graves ranging in date from M.H. to L.H.II. They lie in groups of five, four, or three, and several were graves of children. Some are cist graves of the usual M.H. type, others shallow rock-cut pits, and there is one definite shaft grave smaller than the Royal Graves found by Schliemann but of the same form. In this were seven unbroken vases of late L.H.I style and five gold buttons. The discovery of these graves so near the Royal Shaft Graves and the shaft grave below the Granary shows that the prehistoric cemetery of Mycenae of M.H. and L.H.I-II times was cut</page><page sequence="27">FIG. .-- MYCENAE.

Further excavation in this region should make still clearer the connection between this part of the cemetery and that within the walls, the Grave Circle and the graves beneath the Granary and the houses (Ramp, Warrior Vase, and South Houses). This is of essential importance for the history of the Lion Gate and Grave Circle and Royal Shaft Graves themselves. "At the Treasury of Atreus the construction of the dromos walls was analysed in detail. They are constructed with an ashlar facing of large conglomerate blocks, well bonded with a backing of undressed limestone set with yellow clay and finally a solid support of crude brick of yellow clay which would render the backs of the walls water-tight. The walls are built directly against the rock and so the dromos can never have been any wider. At a point ten metres from the facade of the tomb on both the north and south sides of the dromos, in a hollow in the rock making a kind of large bothros, an enormous deposit of broken pottery, stucco fragments, terracotta figurines, animal bones, shells, and other domestic refuse was found. The character of the pottery, much of which consists of cooking and similar domestic vessels and of the animal bones (mostly domestic animals) which are split for the extraction of the marrow, indicates that this deposit is probably a dump of refuse thrown down the hill from houses above. Trial trenches in search of its origin re- vealed on the top of the ridge above the tomb the foundations of Mycenaean houses, apparently large and well equipped and showed that an important residential quarter had once crowned the hill above the tomb. The bothros deposit was obviously cut through by the builders when they dug into the hillside to construct the tomb, and consequently runs under the north and south walls of the dromos. It thus without doubt antedates the tomb and since the bulk of the pottery in the bothros is late L.H.II or early L.H.III, the Treasury of Atreus cannot be earlier than 1350 B.c. Above this bothros deposit runs a layer of chipped and powdered rock which, since it also contains chips of conglomerate, is ob- viously the material hewn out by the builders of the tomb when they excavated the hillside for the dromos and the dome. This layer of powdered rock surrounds the foot of the dome and stops against a retaining wall, which runs obliquely up the hill from the back of the dromos walls both north and south from a point about ten metres from the facade. This retaining wall was ap- parently designed to hold up the mass of earth over the top of the dome, to protect it and to weight it. At the foot of the retaining wall lay about fifty blocks of poros, tumbled down in disorder, as if the builders of the tomb had cleared them away and thrown them over the edge of the wall to get them out of the way as useless material. The poros blocks from their shapes and size seem to have belonged to some monumental building, perhaps the wall of a large court or terrace, which was removed to make room for the Treas- ury. This material, poros, was popular at Mycenae in the fifteenth century and its use preceded that of the hard conglomerate of which the tomb is built. A poros building would thus have been the natural predecessor of the conglomerate Treasury of Atreus built in the fourteenth century. Two poros blocks found at the foot of the wall which supports the terrace in front of the entrance to the dromos bear mason's marks in a form of the Minoan script, the first time that such marks have been found on the Mainland. "The main results of this year's work, the deter- mination of the date of the temple foundations, the study of the architecture of the House of Columns, the tracing of the prehistoric cemetery outside the Lion Gate, and the knowledge gained of the construction and date of the Treasury of Atreus are all factors of the first importance for the history and culture of Mycenae. Further work, however, remains to be done on all four points and there are other areas at Mycenae which urgently demand investigation." 1 At Thermopylae large-scale excavations were undertaken by the Director of Antiquities of Greece, Mr. Marinatos, with funds provided by an American donor. The chief aim of these ex- plorations was to clear up many topographical problems connected with the battle of 480 B.C. On the east side of the Pass, Mt. Kallidromos ends in a relatively low spur, about 45 m. above the plain, which runs east and west. On this hill various explorations had placed, from time to time and at different places, the Wall of the Phocians, mentioned by Herodotus as that which the Greek forces under Leonidas had repaired and used as the base of their operations. Mr. Mari- natos cleared the whole of this wall, which runs from east to west following the contour of the hill. It is preserved in a fairly good state and is 1 For this report I am indebted to Mr. Wace.</page><page sequence="29">700 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY built in a zigzag line with a square tower at its western end, which is separated from the wall by a narrow passage in the form of a small gate (fig. 2). The remains of this tower were always visible and had been excavated over and over again, since the tower was long considered to be the Polyan- drion of the Three Hundred. It is very probable that the wall terminated in a similar tower at its eastern end; but this section is now badly de- stroyed. Herodotus asserts that in an earlier period the wall had several gates, two of which have been brought to light by this year's excava- tions, one of them being contemporary with the wall as it now stands. The original fortification wall was constructed of large, hard stones in a somewhat archaic style, which in some places resembles the "Cyclopean." Later, repairs were undertaken and for this purpose use was made of a soft stone of salt-formation, produced by the action of the Hot Springs. Perhaps the three ascending stairways behind the wall on the north may belong to this period of reconstruc- tion. The description of Herodotus leaves no doubt that the "Kolonos," the hill on which the Greeks took refuge and where they fell fighting to the last man after the death of Leonidas, was not the same hill on which was built the Phocian Wall. Mr. Marinatos, therefore, investigated another neighboring hill usually marked No. 2 on the older plans. This had previously been excavated and was thought to contain only Byzantine tombs and not to be worth further investigation. The new excavations, however, showed that the summit of the hill had been built over many times from ancient days down to modern times, but from the slopes of the hill great numbers of bronze and iron arrowheads were recovered, proving that this had been the site of a great battle. The arrowheads are of various types (fig. 3) but practically all belong to the fifth century, as may be proved by comparing them with those found at Marathon, from the Acropolis of Athens and from many wells excavated in the Agora at Athens containing fifth-century deposits. There seems then no doubt that these Thermopylae arrowheads came from the battle of 480 B.c. The quantity of these arrow- heads shows that Herodotus' description of the cloud of arrows which the Persians loosed against the Greeks was not exaggerated. Only one iron javelin or spearhead was found, probably Persian. Fortifications occupied the eastern height of "Kolonos" and extend to the flanks of the hill in all directions. The eastern fortification is made of dressed poros blocks, the rest of irregular hard stones. It is obvious that these forts do not constitute a single unified system but were built from time to time and are undoubtedly Hellenistic in date (fig. 4). From the same period come quantities of pottery and masses of coins. It appears that the Kolonos hill was used in that time also as a harbor, since the inner part of the Malian Gulf towards the west had become silted up. In the Roman and Byzantine periods the Kolonos was used for dwelling houses, as is shown by the remains of buildings, abundant tiles and numerous tombs. This development, according to Mr. Marinatos, explains the disappearance of the memorial monument set up to Leonidas and his heroes. Herodotus reports that they were buried where they fell, but after him no one mentions having seen the lion or the inscription set up over the dead. No remains of their bones, even, were found, but there is a little hope that when the lower slopes of the hill are investigated, some traces of the heroes may be found. Unfortunately, however, not only is this area covered by a thick layer of stony formation deposited by the Hot Springs, but water is encountered at a very high level, making it almost impossible to reach the strata of the fifth century.'
