<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT BY R. N. DANDEKAR It is now generally agreed that man is "basically a religious creature. As a finite being, he instinctively yearns for the infinite. Actually he seeks in the Infinite the solace and support for his own finite life. As the Chàndo- gya-Upanisad (Vil. 23.1) says : yo vai bhttmã tat sukham, nã 'lpě sukham asti. It is, indeed, the potential infinity in his finite personality - his instinctive urge to transcend the finitude from which he suffers - that produces in man what may be called a religious feeling. And the most basic factor in this religious feeling may be said to be a vague sense of some power which permeates and directs man and the uni- verse. The doctrine relating to this power is represented by the historians of religion under various names, such as animism, manaism, numenism, dyna- mism, and theism. An extension of this doctrine, which has evoked perhaps the largest consensus, is the claim that the belief in god constitutes the pri- mary principle of all religions. But can such a claim be said to hold good in respect of Hinduism ? It must be confessed, at the very outset, that it is not possible to make any statement which may be generally applicable to Hinduism as a whole. For, Hinduism is by no means a homogeneous entity. Sectarianism is the very essence of Hinduism, and, when any generr.l statement regarding Hindu- ism is made, one or the other of its sects is bound to prove an exception to that statement. This is, indeed, quite understandable in respect of a religion which has arisen and developed without Prophet, without Book, and without Church. Hinduism is not made ; it has grown. It is well and truly said that Hinduism is a jungle and not a deliberately laid out park or garden. Whate- ver could grow in it did actually grow in it. The doctrines and practices of Hinduism can, accordingly, ill lend themselves to any cute generalization. All that one may seek to do is to view the entire situation historically and synoptically. For our present purpose, the history of Hinduism may be conveniently divided into four periods, namely, ( 1 ) the period of the pre-Vedic non- Aryan religious complex, which is basically different from Vedism but whose affilia- li A part of this paper constituted the first Prof. H.

DANDEKAB tions with the classical or historical Hinduism are beyond doubt and essen- tially organic and thus establish à line of direct development with it, and which may, therefore, be justifiably characterised as proto-historical Hinduism; (2) the period of Vedic interlude with its distinct mythology, magic, ritualism, and spiritualism ; ( 3 ) the period of classical or historical Hinduism in its stages of consolidation and proliferation ; and (4) the period of the stagnation of Hinduism and its subsequent confrontation with modernity. The sources of our knowledge of proto-historical Hinduism are neces- sarily limited. We do not possess any literature or popular tradition directly relating to that period ; and all that we have to draw upon consists of archaeo- logical finds and other similar antiquities. It is, however, possible to sketch in broad outline the salient features of the religious situation prevailing in the pre-Vedic non- Aryan period of India's history with the help of the archaeolo- gical and allied evidence as also with the help of the literary reflexes of that situation seen in the later Vedic and other texts. The principal god of that period was represented variously in different parts of the country - as Pasu- pati-Yogîsvara of the Indus people, as the red god Si van of the Pro to-Dra vi- dians, as Šarva of the eastern people, and as Bhava of the Vàhikas or Bàhli- kas. He was the supreme male god associated with the cult of the Mother- Goddess or the " Mothers " who presumably personified that god's power of procreation and sustenance. The proto-historical Hinduism was an idolatrous religion, the god having been worshipped in the form of an image or a carved figure or some other concrete symbol. The existence of public places of wor- ship also cannot be discountenanced. The worship took the form of puja, which basically consisted of anointing the figure òr the symbol of the god normally with the blood of the animal offered to him or otherwise with some suitable substitute. The offering to the god, which often formed part of a communal sacrifice, was usually raw and was made over to the divinity dire- ctly - that is to say, it was of the nature of báli and not of the nature of homa wherein the oblation was usually cooked and was offered to the divinity through sacral fire. On account of the pouring of blood over the figure or the symbol of the god, the god looked red and was, in some parts of the country, áctually called Šiva meaning "red god. " Even the worshippers of that god put sacramental blood on their bodies, or otherwise painted their bodies red or wore fed robes. Yoga, penance and austerities, wandering mendicancy, ecstatic conditions engendered through special medicaments, control and peculiar operation of the virile power, etc., constituted some of the main factors of the proto-historical Hindu religious practice. These factors very markedly diffe- rentiated the pre-Vedic non-Aryan religious culture of the munis and yatis from the Vedic Aryan religious culture of the rsis. But fairly distinct echoes of the former can be heard in some Vediç hymns like the Munisukta ( RV</page><page sequence="3">GOD IN HINDÚ THOUGHT 435 X. 136), the Brahmacari-sukta (AV XI. 5), and the Vraty a-sùktas ÇA V XV ). In view of the fact that most of the significant features of this proto- historical Hinduism are seen to have been preserved, consolidated, and deve- loped in the later Šiva-religion, the former may very well be characterised as the religion of proto-éiva. Vedic Rudra is but an Aryan version of that god. This reconstruction of the proto-historical Hinduism, which was bound to be but cursory, cannot, however, be said sufficiently to enlighten us on the total conception of godhead in that period. All that we are entitled to presume is that, if we visualized the later Siva-religion as an essentially monotheistic religion we might obtain a fairly suggestive glimpse in the proto- hi&amp;torical Hindu theology. With Vedism, a new religious ideology, which is exotic and basically distinct from the proto-historical Hindu religious ideology, makes its appear- ance on the indian scene. Fortunately, from this period onwards, we have a rich and almost unbroken tradition of religious literature, which enables us to study more specifically the topics which are pertinent to our present inquiry, such as the nature of the deity, the relation of the deity to the world, and the relation of the deity to the finite self in its three principal states, namely, th&amp; pTe-samsàra state, the embodied state, and the emancipated state. To begin with the Rgveda, one may say that that Veda is primarily occupied with mythology rather than with theology. To put it in other words, most of the Rgvedic gods appear to have been created for the myths, and not the myths created for the gods. The Rgvedic religion is directly depen- dent on myths. The myth is the primary and unique mode of apprehending reality ; it is thus expressive of the primitive man's experience of reality. The myth, indeed, is the thing, while the divinities seem to have been thought of as mere actors in the mythological drama. In the course of the exuberant growth of mythology - and mythology, it should be remembered, is an essen- tially growing phenomenon - many incidental and sometimes even irrelevant details are added to its nucleus. It is in view of this tendency that my thology is said to be telling " many little lies in the interest of one great truth. " It is generally accepted that Vedic gods are not amenable to being reduced to any kind of system. The character of the Vedic gods, as imagined by the Vedic poets in different contexts, is too fluid and intangible. And this their feature gets more and more confirmed on account of the absence of any attempt, during that period, to represent them in a concrete manner. A sculpture or a painting certainly tends to invest a god with a kind of definite characterisation. Strictly speaking, a Vedic divinity is generally not a god in the spiritual, moral, or mystical sense. He is verily a bundle of epithets and functions. But even in this respect we do not find any logical consistency.</page><page sequence="4">436 R. N. DANDEKAB Whatever theism there is in the Veda is little more than glorified anthropo» morphism, which latter, again, is highly variable. Vedic divinities would seem to defy any classification - whether regional, ritualistic, or functional. They are too vague and impersonal for such classification. In this connection, Barnett actually went to the extent of saying that the Vedic people whose imagination created Vedic deities had never felt any deep interest in them and that the Vedic poet-priests had not been able to cover them with the flesh and blood of living personality.1 Notwithstanding all this, attempts have been made to discover some norm or derive some system by means of an analysis of Vedic mythology. The Nirukta of Yãska refers to the theories of scholiasts like the Nairuktas, the Aitihãsikas, and the Yãjnikas. The etymological-naturalistic interpreta- tion of Vedic mythology, sponsored by Yãska, found a large following among the modern Vedists. They were content to look upon myths «s a kind of paraphrase of natural phenomena; for them, Vedic mythology was little more than " a plastic and popular physics and astronomy. " It is hardly nece- ssary to emphasize the inherent inadequacy of such a view. Suffice it to point •out that it was but inevitable that the religious thinking of the Vedic people, who lived in immediate contact with nature, should have been profoundly influenced by naturalistic concepts, but those concepts cannot be said to have constituted the basic foundation of their religious thinking. Natural pheno- mena generally do not create myths and legends; the similarity with a natural phenomenon may only help mythologically to reinforce a story which often has a real historical happening for its basis. Some scholars have gone a little deeper into the question of the signi- ficance of Vedic religion and mythology.2 A reference may be made here to some of the typical views in this connection. Max Müller, for instance, begins with certain basic assumptions. According to him, all religions have some common basic elements, such as the realisation of the Divine in the actual, the feeling of human weakness and dependence, the faith in the divine ordering of the world, the consciousness of good and bad, and the hope for a higher and better life. Again, all religions, howsoevermuch they may differ in other respects, agree in one point, namely, that their evidence is not entirely supplied by sensuous perception. In connection with this latter, Max Müller thinks that, s» far as the Vedic religion is concerned, two factors must have been operative : ( 1 ) some kind of external revelation as is suggested by the-word sruti and ( 2 ) a kind of religious instinct, which 1. L. D. Barnett, Hindu Gods and Heroes , p. 13. 2. For a detailed statement, see : Daxdkkar, " Vedic Religion and Mythology", JUPBSZl, 1-53.</page><page sequence="5">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 437 only man, among all living creatures, possesses. He then goes on to point out that, by a simple psychological analysis, we can discover three classes of things , which we can perceive with our senses, but which leave in us three very distinct kinds of impression of reality : ( 1 ) tangible objects, such as stones, shells, and bones, which are supposed to have been the earliest ob- jects of religious worship by the religion-historians who hold fetishism to be the first beginnings of all religion ; ( 2 ) semi-tangible objects, such as trees, mountains, rivers, the sea, and the earth; and ( 3 ) intangible objects, such as the sky, the stars, the sun, the dawn, and the moon. The testimony of the Veda, Max Müller further points out, shows that, out of the three fore- going classes of objects, the first is hardly represented at all among the so- called deities of the Rgveda. As for the semi-tangible objects, each one of them can be met with among the deities of the Veda. Max Müller characte- rises these deities as semi-deities. In the intangible objects can be discovered the germs of what may be called full-deities. Max Muller's conception of Vedic mythology is naturalistic, and in his naturalistic conception he seems always to stress the solar aspect. Here it is neither possible nor necessary to subject Max Müller's views to any critical examination ; it may only be pointed out that the facts of Vedic mythology as stated by him are often correct, but his interpretation oí them is not always convincing. The starting point of Bergaigne is the assumption of the rigorous inter- dependence of Vedic mythology and Vedic cult. The sacrificial ritual is, according to him, the true reproduction on earth of the cosmic phenomena. These phenomena are of two kinds : ( 1 ) those which accompany the rising of the sun ( solar phenomena ) ; and ( 2 ) those which accompany the falling of rain after a long drought (meteorological phenomena). In both these kinds of phenomena, Vedic mythology distinguishes between male and female ele- ments ; and these different elements are represented differently in the frame- work of mythological anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. From this bare sketch of Bergaigne' s theory it would be seen that, though Bergaigne started with a view to presenting Vedic religion and mythology as a simple system consisting of a few easily intelligible formulas, he actually ended by produ- cing only a complicated and essentially schematic pattern. Rudolf Otto approaches the Veda not from the point of view of philo- logy or Indology, but from the point of view of psychology and history of religion. He believes that the genesis of the Vedic gods ( indeed, of any gods ) cannot be traced back to the effects produced on man's mind by the great phenomena of nature, such as the sun, the sky, the storm, the winds, etc., but that, at the bottom of all consciousness of divinity, there is the specific and a priori faculty of apperception of a power which may best be termed as a</page><page sequence="6">438 B. N. DANDEKAR 'numen'. It will, however, be easily agreed that Vedic mythology is too com- prehensive and variegated to be squeezed into the narrow frame of the numinous. In recent years, Dumézil has developed a new comparative mythology . Following the lead of Durkheim, who insisted on a functional relationship between social and sacred phenomena, Dumízil arrives at his tripartite divi- sion of Indo-European social organization into priests, warriors, and food- producers ( that is, peasants and artisans") as a keystone of a common religio- mythological ideology. He then goes on to point out that, so far as the Vedic religion and mythology are concerned, the two antithetical yet complementary divine rulers Mitra and Varuna are the representatives of the class of priests, Indra ( or Vãyu ) of that of warriors, and Asvins of that of food-producers. Dumézil is rightly critisised for being " carried away by his own hypotheses, constructions, and subjective interpretations. " My own view is that Vedic mythology is essentially an evolutionary mythology. Its general character has changed in accordance with the vicis- situdes in the cultural life of the Vedic people. For instance, it would be seen that a certain specific god was regarded as having been sovereign and supreme in a certain specific period. The reason for this was that the character and personality of that god were in full conformity with the ethos of that period. This is one aspect of the evolutionary mythology. The other aspect of it is that, though the basic character of a divinity was determined by the peculiar environments in which it had come into being, that character did not remain static and stagnant throughout. It underwent various modifications in accor- dance with the changing conditions of life of the Vedic Aryans. In the course of its evolution, many new features gradually accumulated round that divinity so that the total personality which it finally presented was highly complex. I, however, believe that it is not altogether impossible to analyse the complex character and personality of a Vedic god, generally isolate from one another the various elements in that character, and then broadly mark out, with the help of comparative philology, comparative mythology, anthropology, and the cultural history of the Vedic Aryans, the different stages in the evolution of that god. I should like to characterize the primary and the most basic religious concept in the early Vedic period as Orendism or Asuism. The Vedic man believed in a magic potence - and he often thought of it in terms of some- thing like " soul-stuff " - which permeated through nature and human world and thereby constituted the essential basis of their existence and functioning. This magic potence was shared alike by gods, human beings, animals, trees, -etc. - of course in varying proportions. It was on account of this that the</page><page sequence="7">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 439 Vcdic man made no sharp distinction between spirit and matter, living and lifeless, person and thing, abstract and concrete, substance and attributes, etc. The concept of a somatic magic potence such as this was, indeed, common to the religious ideologies of many primitive peoples, The name for this potence, which is particularly popular with the anthropologists, is Mana or Orenda, and its Vedic counterpart, in my view, is asu . It is from these names that I have coined the terms Orendism and Asuism. The Vedic man further believed that, through his mantra and cultic action, new asu could be created and the existing asu either enhanced or reduced or transferred from one entity to another. The essential nature of the Vedic gods is that they are asuras or special possessors of the ú^w-potence. Varuna is asura par excellence and is often celebrated, in the Rgveda , as the samràt, who, by virtue of his power of bondage arising from his asuratva, establishes the cos- mic order rta in this vast and complex universe. This may be said to be the norm of the cosmic myth which is presented in the Veda in varying forms and with different gods in different contexts. The Vedic poet-priest speaks of several other aspects of this essential magic potence, to whose operation man is believed to be subjected either positively or negatively. The Vedic poet-priest further emphasizes the fact that, while man is dependent for his existence and functioning on the bearers of the magic ¿ww-potence ( asuras ), the latter too are dependent for their proper functioning on man's mantra and cultic action. This sense of mutual interdependence may, indeed, be said to be at the very root of the cosmic ethics of ancient Indians. To recapitulate: So far as the primary conception of godhead of the early Vedic poet-priests is concerned, three points need to be specially stres- sed, namely, ( 1 ) that the Vedic gods are generally conceived as being sub- servient to an all-pervading magic potence ; ( 2 ) that, since they participate in this magic potence together with all other categories of existence-, they cannot be said to be essentially distinct from the latter ( the ' potence * being more basic and more important than the ' person ' or ' thing ' in which it inheres ); and ( 3 ) that all these categories, including gods, are dependent on one another for their proper functioning. This, in brief, is the only theology that one can derive from the Rgveda. Everything else is mythology. Apart from the primary cosmic myth, which has been referred to above, the most significant of the factors which have become operative in the process of the evolution and growth of Vedic mythology are mythologisation of history mainly through the superimposition of naturalistic-cosmic elements ( as repre- sented in the Indra-legends ) and hiérarchisation of popular religious cults, wherein solarization has played a particularly prominent role, ( as, for ins- tance, seen in the evolution of the mythology relating to Visnu and POsan).</page><page sequence="8">440 B. N. DANDBKAB Theologically, the religion of the Rgveda may be characterised as " pan-asuism ", if I am permitted to coin such a word to denote the religious doctrine according to which the universe conceived as a whole is asu. But, mythologically, that religion is certainly polytheistic. It is a polytheism of anthropomorphic character. A few pertinent points need to be taken into account in this context. The anthropomorphism of the Vedic gods, it will be seen, is itself highly variable. Again, properly speaking, there is no hierarchy among these gods. There are no clear and well-defined functions in the world-process and world-rule assigned to the various members of the Vedic pantheon. As a matter of fact, one may hardly speak of a pantheon of Vedic gods in the strictest sense of the term. They do not have any recognised un- disputed leader like Zeus or Jupiter, and they present a picture of " inter- minable variety of ranks and confusing interchange of characters. " In view of these facts, the Rgvedic polytheism must be said to be a diffuse polytheism. It is suggested that one may discover in the Rgveda a distinct trend towards its polytheism gradually making way to monotheism. For one thing, there is noticeable an increasing tendency to identify the gods oné with another, which Max Müller calls syncretism. The frequent grouping of gods also points in the same direction. Then there are suggestions that all Vedic divi- nities are participants in the same divine essence. Further, the Vis've Devãh are regarded as embodying the concept of collective godhead, and a few pas- sages from the Rgveda are believed to reflect a kind of " integral multiplicity " in the divine world. In spite of all such indications, it must be clearly stated that monotheism in the sense of a single ethical god who, while being intima- tely involved in the world-process, is yet transcendental in character had not developed in the Vedic period. Indeed, such monotheism cannot be said to have developed in any period of the history of Hinduism, except perhaps in the proto-historical period. Whatever indications there are in the Veda point to monism rather than to monotheism. For instance, the oft-quoted Rgvedic passage (I. 164. 46), ekam sad viprã bahudhã vadami, cannot be said to imply monotheism. The neuter ekam and the fact that the manifold forms, of that one principle are stated to have been accepted as an established fact would go against such an interpretation. In the creative process of the universe, the 'many' issues out of the 'one'; in the thinking process of man, on the other hand, he seeks to reduce the ' many ' to the ' one It is this latter trait which is often misrepresented as suggesting monotheism. In his treatment of Vedic religion. Max Müller has emphasized one significant tendency of the Vedic poets, namely, to celebrate individual gods successively as the highest. To this successive belief in single supreme gods he has given the name of henotheism or kathenotheism.1 To identify Indra, 1, See : Dandbkar, op. cit.</page><page sequence="9">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 441 Agni, and Varuna is one thing; it is syncretism. To address either Indra or Agni or Varuna as, for the time being, the only god in existence with an entire forgetfulness of all other gods is quite another. According to Max Müller, it is this latter tendency, the henotheistic tendency, which is fully developed and predominantly reflected in the hymns of the Rgveda. Max Müller further adds that henotheism marks a stage between the original polytheism and the later monotheism of the Rgveda. Oldenberg characterizes henotheism as an appearance rather than a reality, for, as he seeks to point out, such successive glorification of the Vedic gods has a reference to different sacrificial contexts and thus has little theological value. Bloomfield also explains the phenomenon of henotheism on ritualistic grounds and adds that henotheism is '* polytheism grown cold in service, and unnice in its distinctions, leading to an opportunist mono- theism in which every god takes hold of the sceptre and none keeps it. " The protagonists of Urmonotheism ( that is, of the doctrine that belief in one single god is primary in all-religions ) are inclined to regard henotheism as deteriorated monotheism. According to Rudolf Otto, the so-called heno- theism only indicates that certain Vedic tribes worshipped certain gods as their special gods and placed them above others. It is just a case of tribal ( or, as Hillebrandt would put it, regional ) monolatry. It is also sugges- ted by some scholars that the same mental attitude as inspired the dànastutis ( or eulogies of patrons ) also inspired henotheistic hymns. That is to say, blatant flattery was at the bottom of those hymns. It may, first of all, be pointed out that the tendency observed by Max Müller is an indisputable fact of Vedic mythology. His suggestion that the Vedic religious thought has developed from polytheism through henothe- ism to monotheism is also probable; but it actually did not happen that way, for, the Vedic religion never became monotheistic. To speak, in the context of henotheism, of ' various ' monotheisms or of monotheisms with changing gods is theologically unsound. The conception of Urmonotheism does not seem to be valid at least so far as the Vedic religion is concerned. The Vedic tendency, as mentioned earlier, is to go from the ' many ' to the 'one' and not vice versa. Henotheism cannot, therefore, be explained as the last remem- brance and relic of the original monotheism. Similarly, there is no evidence to support the assumption that henotheism is either a ritualistic device or a tribal trait. To compare henotheistic passages with dànastutis amounts to a gross misconception of both. Henotheism is certainly not intended merely for the practical purpose of flattering certain gods with a view to gaining trea- sures from them. Henotheism represents a distinct religious attitude, namely, that of eclecticism (as against absolutism or exclusjvism) which has çharacte- 4BORI 56</page><page sequence="10">442 R. N. dandekab rised Hinduism almost throughout its histoiy. Its further development may be traced to the concept of istadevatä which implies a complete freedom of choosing one's special god and mode of worship, without, however, allowing that freedom to become in any way detrimental to other gods and other forms of worship. Monotheism is essentially exclusive in character. Accordingly, henotheism is not only not a stage leading towards monotheism, but, in a sense, it implies an opposition to it. One could claim that one's god was supreme, but one must not claim that that god was unique. It may be inci- dentally added that it is the two doctrines, namely, of adhikãra ( spiritual com- petence) and of istadevatä (freedom of worship), which have helped to bring about a kind of religious adjustment among the various peoples and cults which have gone to make up the unity that is Hinduism. Two main tendencies are noticeable in what may be presumed to be the last stages in the evolution of Rgvedic religion. A feeling seems to have been gradually taking root in the minds of the Rgvedic poet-priests that the mythological gods were quite inadequate to satisfy their religious instinct. They were, as it were, groping for a real god, and, therefore, asked in great anguish : kasmai demy a havisä vidhema (RVX. 121 ). The other tendency, as shown earlier, was to reduce the perplexing multiplicity in the divine world to some kind of unity. There is very little of mythology in the Atharvaveda, for, mythopoetic activity and magic do not normally go well together. The gods as represent- ed in that Veda are but subservient to magic which is the central theme of that Veda. And the basic foundation of the Atharvanic magic is none other than the " panasuism " of the Rgveda. This latter is also at the root of the Vedic ritual such as has been developed in the Bràhmanas. The Brãhmanas seem to give some prominence to the new god Prajâpati, which fact has per- suaded some scholars to discover a kind of monotheism in it. But Prajâpati is by no means a mythological or a theological deity. He does not possess any individuality ; he mostly appears as the central figure in the ritual of creative self-immolation. The Vedic ritual is conceived as an autonomous phenomenon and as operating automatically, that is, independently of god or man. In the ideology of the Vedic ritual, gods do not play any important role. The Bràhmana-texts, which set great store by the correct performance of an inordinately complex system of sacrifices, may be said to have actually ous- ted god from the centre of the religious stage ( if he had at all occupied that centre any time ! ). Indeed, it was sacrifice which was believed to have best- owed godhead on gods. Sacrifice was intended to coerce gods rather than to propitiate them. If the Brahmanic ritualism had divested the mythological gods of their individualities an&lt;J functions, the Upanisadic spiritualism completely negatived</page><page sequence="11">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 443 their importance and influence in connection with the world-process. The early Upanisads taught the doctrine of the ultimate identity between the brah- man, the universe, and the individual self. This utter monism allowed no scope whatsoever for theism. It was, however, obviously not possible that such a rigorous metaphysical position could be maintained for long. Popular religious sentiment is not satisfied with an abstract impersonal entity ; it craves for a personal deity. Besides, there must have been pressures both of a positive and of a negative character - from the non-Vedic religious ideologies. Consequently there began to appear, in the Upanisads , more or less clear-cut theistic tendencies which are seen to have reached their culmi- nation in the Svetä'svatara-Upanisad. Already in the Chàndogya- Upan i sad (III. 14), éàndilya speaks of the àtman in terms which are reminiscent of a personal god. The antaryàmin-àoQix'mt of the Brhadaranyaka- U pani sad ( III. 7, 8) and that Upani$aďs characterisation of Ûitmahàn âtmâas sarvasya vasi , sarvasya ìsànah, sarvasya adhipatih, sarvesvarah , bhutädhipatih , bhûtapàlah, etc. ( IV. 4.22 ), may also be regarded as a step in the theistic direction. The Brhadär any aka-U pani sad 4. 7) seems to think of ihe supreme being as something external to the world. But a distinct intimation of the transition from monism to theism becomes available from the Mundaka-U panisad and more particularly from the Svetä'svatara-Upanisad . The Svetàsvalara-Upanisad (I. 12) unequivocally distinguishes bhokta (the individual self), bhogya ( the phenomenal world ), and preritã ( the god ) from one another, and then speaks of those three forming trividham brahma. The supreme being is referred to (IV. 11-13) by terms denoting a personal god, such as isãna , varada , idya deva , vi'svàdhipa, devänäm adhipa, etc. He is the source and origin of the gods, the ruler of all, Rudra. The lord is the supporter of all this which is a combination of mutable and immutable. He is not identical with the individual self, but pervades it without sharing in its imperfections and ac- tions. There is also a suggestion in that Upanisad of a bhaktiA ike personal relationship between the supreme being and the individual self. The god in his immanent aspect is to be known through yoga ; the god in his transcen- dent aspect is to be worshipped with loving devotion. Further, the Svetà - svatara-U panisad emphasizes the necessity of moral conduct and the possibi- lity of the grace of god. The Svetä'svatara-Upanisad may thus be regarded as presenting perhaps the earliest full-fledged theistic statement in historical Hinduism. And the fact that the great god according to that statement is Rudra is historically very significant, for, it may have been a direct result of the influence of the proto-historical Hindu monotheism centering round proto-éiva.</page><page sequence="12">444 ft. N. ĎAÍfĎBKAfi The history of classical Hinduism presents a strange phenomenon. While, on the one hand, Hinduism sought to substitute the impersonal absolute of the Upanisads1 with a personal god, the various philosophical systems, which it adopted as its own, were, by and large, basically atheistic. The Sàmkhya system, for instance, whose beginnings, incidentally, must be traced back to the pre-Vedic non-Aryan thought-complex, had originally no place for god in its metaphysics. The process of the evolution of the material and the psychological world from the Prakrti was believed to be autonomous. It was only at a later stage in the development of the Sämkhya doctrine that god came to be posited as being instrumental in bringing Prakrti and Purusa into contact with each other and thereby initiating the world-process. The Hinduism of the epics and the Purànas has mostly sponsored this latter kind of Sämkhya, namely, the se'svara Sàmkhya. The Yoga system, which con- cerns itself essentially with mental and spiritual discipline but which has generally adopted the Sàmkhya doctrine as its metaphysical basis, does accept god. God, according to that system, is after all a Purusa or soul ; but he is a distinctive kind of soul. He is different from other souls not so much be- cause he is eternal and transcends the limitations of time, but because, unlike other Purusas, he ever remains unaffected by the ramifications of Prakrti. He is also said to be responsible for the maintenance of the cosmic order, but he is never specifically represented as the cause of the universe, He is thus red- eemed of any liability for the inequality and cruelty in the world. Not only this, but he is said to be positively compassionate. There is further an indi- cation in the Yoga system of a kind of an ontological argument such as that, since we have an idea of a Perfect Supreme Being, such a Being must be in existence. But the most outstanding feature of god's personality which the Yoga system seems to emphasise is that he is the ideal object of contempla- tion. Yogic concentration, it is suggested, is facilitated through devotion to god. The Yoga system may, accordingly, be said to reflect the beginnings of the theistic ideal of religio-ethical godhead. The Vais'esikas, like the Sämkhyas, generally seem to hold that the world-process is in no way dependent on god, though, it may be added, the Vaiiesika-Stitras proper do not contain any direct passage bearing on the creation and the dissolution of the universe. The Vaisesika system maintains that reason cannot prove the existence of god. However, the attitude of that systeni towards god cannot be said to be as uncompromising as that of the original Sàmkhya. The later Vaisesika theory such as is, for instance, developed in the bhàsya of Pras'astapäda, presumably under the growing thei- stic influence, speaks of god as being actively instrumentai in the evolution and dissolution of the universe. TheNyãya system represents not so much</page><page sequence="13">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 445 a philosophical system as a logical methodology. Its metaphysical basis is derived largely from the Vaisesika atomism. It mentions god mainly as the sentient administrator of the law of Karma. It is god who ensures that that law does not operate promiscuously. Some Naiyãyikas, like Vacaspati and Udayana, offer logical proof for the existence of a primal cause possessing intelligence of the highest order. God is believed to initiate the creative pro- cess. He is the operative cause of the universe, but he does not get liimself involved in the workings of the universe. It, however, needs to be underlined that the god of the Nyãya system is hardly comparable to the personal god of the proper theistic ideology. The Pûrvamïmàmsà treats god with scant respect. For, according to it, the Vedic ritual, which is its chief concern, operates automatically and autonomously. God is subservient to the ritual performance and is often regarded as even superfluous. Indeed, for the POrvamímãmsã, which essen- tially deals with the technique of interpreting the Vedic texts, the subject of god is almost irrelevant. It, therefore, often ignores god. It has been well said that, according to Mímãmsã, gods can be regarded only as hypo- thetical entities which one has to assume because they are essential for the ritual act. In the eyes of the Mlmàmsakas, * Veda ' is far more vital and important than ' deva Incidentally, the Vedic ritual does not also' seem to bother about the moralness of the character of the sacrificer and the offici- ating priests or of the purpose of the sacrificial act. A characteristic feature of the Vedànta as represented by áamkara is the assumption of two main levels of reality - transcendental or absolute and phenomenal or empirical. The ultimate and the only reality is, no doubt, the brahman in its transcendental aspect. Naturally enough, this immutable brahman cannot be made liable for any kind of activity like that of creating the universe. . The universe may have. only relative reality, but its creation had nonetheless to be explained. It is in this context that god is posited by áamkara. In other words, god is real on the same level as the individual self and the universe. The conception of god is, after all, a hypothesis which right knowledge eventually discards. But, as long as that right philosophical knowledge does not dawn upon a person, he has to accept god seriously and with adequate zeal. Thus éamkara does not deny the existence of god on the empirical level. However, on this level, the individual self is not to be identified with god. For, the ways in which the maya operates with reference to god on the one hand and to the individual self on the other are essentially different. Of course, when the maya ceases to operate, there is neither god nor individual self.</page><page sequence="14">446 ìt. N. DANDEKAR A brief mention may now be made of the attitude of some of the avo- wedly theistic schools. The Bhagavadgitä seems to oscillate between panthei- stic monism on the one hand and fervent theism relating to a personal god on the other. It sometimes represents god as an aspect of the brahman - as a personalized version of the brahman -it being thus suggested that the brahman is the supreme being, but it ultimately proclaims as its guhyatama - most esoteric - teaching that, beyond the undifferentiated unity of the brahman , there is the god, who is the Supreme Person characterised by num- berless perfections, who is the ethical lord, who is actively involved in the world-process but who nevertheless remains eternally changeless in his essence, and who, above all, bears deep affection and love for his devotees. The teaching of the Bhagavadgitä regarding the nature of god continues to dominate the later religio-philosophical texts of the Bhâgavatas, such as the Näräyaniya and the Anugità in the Mahàbhãrata, the Visnu-Puräna , the P ari- car ätra-Samhitäs, and the Bhägavata-Puräna. The only noteworthy modifi- cation in the basic teaching of the Bhagavadgitä is the doctrine of vyuhas, which is adumbrated in the Naräyaniya and fully developed in the Pàhcarãtra • Samhitäs. According to this doctrine, the true nature of Vasudeva, the sup- reme god, is constituted of the sãdgunya or six qualities, namely, jmna or absolute consciousness with its five characteristics, sakti (which enables Vãsudeva to become the material cause of the universe), aisvarya ( or indi- pendent spontaneous power of action), baia (or inexhaustible power of sustaining the world), virya (or the ability to remain unchanged despite being the material cause ), and tejas ( or prestige and authority with which he brings forth the universe without any extraneous help ). These six gunas are represented, on the one hand, as forming Vasudeva's body, and, on ths other, as serving, through the three vyuhas - Samkarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha - in each of these vyuhas only two out of the six gunas being spe- cially attested, as the instruments of his creative activity. Madhva may be said to be teaching a sort of an almost undiluted monotheism. He unequivocally recognizes the dualism between god and the creation, both of which are real, though he does not fail to add that god alone is absolute and independent. Madhva emphasizes the fivefold difference, namely, between god and soul, between god and matter, between soul and matter, between one soul and another, and between one atom of matter and another. Indeed, he is so uncompromising in this respect that he is not un- often seen to be twisting the patently pantheistic texts to yield monotheistic- dualistic sense. As for the theism of Vallabha and Caitanya it may be pointed out that emotional, passionate -almost erotic -love for a personal god is its most outstanding feature.</page><page sequence="15">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 447 But by far the ablest statement of what may be called philosophical theism we owe to Ràmànuja. Ràmànuja' s personality often betrays an inner conflict between a philosopher and a theologian - the latter usually having the upper hand. Ràmànuja was not only a metaphysician, he was also -and perhaps more essentially -a foutíder of a religious sect. According to him, the existence of god cannot be established by means of logic. For instance, one cannot argue, as on the empirical plane, that just as a living body presupposes the existence of the soul or intelligent agent, even so does the world-process presuppose the existence of an intelligent motive principle like god. For, the analogy here is not perfect, the soul not being ever assumed as the creator of the body. Nor can the analogy of potter-clay-pitcher be regarded as compel- ling enough to establish in connection with the universe the existence of god as the agent possessing the knowledge of the material cause. For, as Ràmànuja seems to suggest, even a lesser being than god as he has conceived of him would be quite adequate for the purpose. On the other hand^ though the scriptures constitute for Ràmànuja the only authoritative source for the knowledge of god, his peculiar attitude towards the Upanisads tends to show that he has realised that the Upanisads do not support the doctrine sponsored by him. God, according to Ràmànuja, has for his attributes the six gunas , namely, jnàrta, etc., mentioned by the Pàncaràtra texts. He is characterised by all perfections. He is the supreme divinity which creates this world of manifold experience which is essentially real. The world, consisting of souls and matter, is dependent on god ; it is, indeed, god's body. Ràmànuja further points out that the world is related to god as modes or attributes are related to substance. This would bring out the appropriateness of his teaching being designated as vikista advaita. Incidentally it may be noted that, according to Ràmànuja, god exists in five different modes - as Para or the entire supreme spirit, as the four vyuhas , as an avatära like Ràma or Krsna, as the antaryämin, and as a duly consecrated image. Various views have been put forth regarding the nature of god and the ultimate reality in modern Hindu thoiight. The Arya Samaj, for instance, seems to sponsor a kind of monotheism as against Vedàntic monism. It believes in three fundamental realities, namely, god, soul, and the universe^ On the other hand, Šri Aurobindo speaks of integral advaitism-of one Brahman with positive and negative aspects. But the general trend in Neo - Hinduism may be said to be towards some kind of reconciliation between the absolute and the god. Swami Vivekananda regards god as the dynamic aspect of the highest reality. Tagore thinks of the reality as being both im- personal and personal, as changeless and evolving, as being and becoming. And according to Radhakrishnan, the god is the absolute from the cosmic point of view and the absolute represents the precosmic nature of god.</page><page sequence="16">448 R. N. DANDBKAB It may be specially pointed out here that, in whatever forms theism developed in classical Hinduism and Neo-Hinduism, it always had a panthei- stic tinge. Hindu temperament and Hindu logic must be said to be parti- cularly conducive to a pantheistic religion. Indeed, India, as a whole, has come to be recognised as the classic land of pantheism, and the various Indian religions are regarded as representing but different stages of pantheism. There is, however, often perceptible a tendency to suggest that even pantheism is not the ultimate truth. Actually Hindu thought is not inclined to make any sharp distinction between philosophical monism and religious pantheism. It is, therefore, not infrequently that this monism-pantheism tends to be repre- sented ( or, rather, misrepresented ) either as acosmism or as polite atheism. The two main questions relating to god and the world-process are : ( i ) How did god create the world ? and ( ii ) why did god create the world ? Various views have been expressed in connection with the first question. To begin with, there are some schools of Hindu thought which do not at all re- gard the world as the handiwork of god. Indeed, Hinduism is said to repre- sent a peculiar religious phenomenon in which god does not necessarily figure as the creator nor does his will constitute the moral law. One extreme view is that the phenomenal world is basically an illusion, a false presentment of god or the ultimate reality, an imagined transformation of the supreme being. The usual analogy in this respect is that of the rope which, under certain circumstances, appears as serpent. It is pointed out that so long as the world appears it is in the Brahman which is the only reality. This does not, how- ever, affect the transcendent character of the ultimate reality, Brahman, in the same way as the essential " ropeness " of the rope is in no way affected by its transient appearance as serpent. From the ultimate point of view, there does not exist any god as such apart from the impersonal, absolute Brahman. How- ever, in view of the essential immutability of Brahman, the existence of god may be temporarily posited as a kind of connecting link between the immu- table Brahman and the temporary illusion of the world. For, as long as the illusion of the world is not recognized as an illusion, it does possess what may be called relative reality. So, god, according to this view, stands on the §ame level of reality as the world and the individual self. The Brãhmanas and the early Upanisads often mention a cosmological theory according to which creation amounts to some kind of emenation or rather discharge ( sfsti ) which is not dependent either on the will or the activity of a divine person. In other words, creation is there represented .»s a purely materialistic process. Another cosmological theory, which is athei- stic and materialistic, presupposes the time-less co-existence of two essentially contradictory and mutually independent entities, namely, prakrti or the un- differentiated matter, which, however, possesses the potentiality of evolving.</page><page sequence="17">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 449 and purusa or the multiplicity of souls which is capable of seeing but incapa- ble of acting. These two come into a relation with each other - one cannot say how -and the process of the evolution of the cosmological and psychologi- cal world is thereby started. The Vaisesika cosmology, which involves a specific kind of conglomeration of eternally existing atoms, is, like the original Sàmkhya prakrti-purusa cosmology, also atheistic. Side by side with such atheistic - materialistic theories of creation, there have developed in Indian thought, even from very early times, different kinds of personalistic-theistic theories of creation. The descriptions of Vedic gods as having been responsible for the creation and sustenance of the universe have to be understood rather as poetical exercises intended to emphasize the power and greatness of those gods than as any deliberate cosmological speculations. But a reference must be made in this connection to the view suggested in the Purusasùkta ( RV X. 90 ) that the universe is the result of the ritual self-im- molation of a hermaphrodite man-god. Some Upanisadic accounts, however, represent cosmology with a more specific personalistic bias. For instance, the Pra'sna-Upaniscid (1. 3-13) tells us that, at the beginning of creation, Prajàpati the creator, having become desirous of creation, practised penance, and, after having practised penance, produced the pristine couple, rayi and prána , who eventually created all existence. Elsewhere ( Taittirìya-Up . II.6 ), Prajàpati is said to have become tired of his solitude and, by way of a relief from that solitude, to have emitted whatever existed. The ideas underlying these two theories seem to have merged together to give rise to a third theory. Ätman, who alone existed in the beginning of things in the form of man, with a view to getting rid of his loneliness, divided himself into two halves -one male and another female -and then procreated the various species in the organic world ( Brhadàranyaka Up . 1.4.1-4). These and similar other theories are no doubt more or less personalistic ( in contrast to the purely impersonalistic-materia- listic theories referred to above ), but they can by no means be characterized as theistic in the strictest sense of the term. A mention has already been made of the inclusion of god in sòme cos- mological theories as a demiurge or a secondary creator. It may be added that the demiurge is sometimes represented also as the power ( maya , iakti) or the manifestation ( vyïiha ) of the ultimate reality which alone must be re- garded as the absolute substratum and source of the universe. In this context must be mentioned also the imagery of the golden embryo, in which the first personal creative being is represented as having himself proceeded from ä material substratum. In the mythical form, this being is called Hiranyagarbha or Nàràyana.1 Such cosmological ideologies, however, are basically pantheistic 1. Cf. ?KX. 121; also Ch.-Up. IIT. 19. 1-3; Nrsimhatãpanipa^Up. I, 1, 57</page><page sequence="18">450 R. N. DANDBKAB and seem to have later developed in the direction of a pale and shallow theism which Hinduism is said to have often " confessed with lips but which has never won the homage of its heart." 1 In a more distinctly theistic theory, the creation is represented as a process of manifestation or evolution starting from god. The world-process is, indeed, regarded as a rhythmic movement consisting of alternate emissions and reabsorptions of the world by the supreme being. It is this form of cosmology which usually figures in the Purànic Hin- duism. Another cosmological theory which is popular with the Puranas is a modification of the original Sàmkhya doctrine. At a later stage in the deve- lopment of the Sàmkhya doctrine, god came to be superimposed on the pra- krti -purusa dualism (pluralism ?) as having been responsible for bringing prakrti and purusa into contact with each other and thereby initiating the world-process. Prakrti and purusa came to be regarded as just the two aspects of the supreme lord who, through his guiding and controlling will, gave the first impulse to prakrti to shake off its equilibrium. It may be added that, like this theistic Sàmkhya doctrine, we also have a theistic Vaisesika doctrine which postulates a god who is responsible for switching on the process of the con- glomeration of the eternally existing atoms. Thus, by and large, the role of god in Hindu cosmological speculations may be said to have been thought of only secondarily, and its scope to have been regarded as very much limited. Assuming that god created the world, one might feel naturally inclined to ask oneself as to what could have been god's motive for doing so. This motive cannot have been ' love ', for, love normally implies the craving for sympathy and fellowship from an entity other than oneself and god is believed to transcend all kinds of craving. Nor can it have been the impulse to 'work', for, work normally aims at getting one's needs satisfied or one's insufficiencies recouped and god is regarded as being free from all needs and insufficiencies. Similarly, the world cannot have been created by god for his own benefit, because god is perfect ; it cannot have also been created for the benefit of man, because it is characterized by innate inequality and cruelty. Again, in creating the universe, god cannot be said to have felt urged to execute any Specific plan. Indeed, in connection with god's relation to the world, Hindu thinkers have hardly ever thought in terms of the design, plan, or object of the wòrld. It is sometimes suggested that god created the world because he was moved by some reproductive impulse, by an instinctive urge to multiply himself ; or that it was j ust a passing whim of god. But this would seem to go against the rationality of god. Another assumption is that god himself, as much as man, is subject to some universal law which constrains him to create the world. Obviously, such an assumption would negate the omni- 1, Cf. Barth, The Religions of India , 69,</page><page sequence="19">OOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 451 potence of god. According to still another view, god has created the world with a view to affording man the opportunity to redeem himself of his liabi- lities under the moral law of Karma ( though, it must be added, the law of Karma is believed to be operating independently of god and god in no way predestinates the conditions of man's life ). This would, on the one hand, account for the inequality and cruelty in the world without making the crea- tor responsible for them, and would, on the other, emphasize god's solicitude for man in hastening his journey on the road to moksa. In a sense, god is keen on facilitating the divinization of man. For, god is said to desire union with the soul as fervently as the soul desires union with god. Hinduism, it may be pointed out, does not stop with affording only a one-way road, namely, from the soul to god; it provides for a two-way communication bet- ween the two. But the theory which seems to have been found generally acceptable by various schools of thought is that the world-process is but the sport -/í/â - of god. This Vilã, which provides an outlet for the exuberant . spirit of god, is to be thought of just as play for the sake of play. Essentially it amounts to the release of energy for the sake of release of energy.1 The assumption of lilã alone can explain why one who is perfect and self-sufficient does do anything. Actually to impute any motive to god's activity would mean deny- ing his very god-head. Lilà constitutes a motive which is indeed no motive at all. The assumption of lilà is significant from yet another point of view. Metaphorically, the word lilà would very well bring out the sense of the mira- cle of the ' one ' appearing as ' many '. It would further suggest the tempo- ral character of the world whose reality is not to be taken with absolute seri- ousness. Again, the concept of lilã, in its sexual connotation, may be related to the concept of god and his consort ňakli being responsible for the creation of the universe. It is also not unlikely that the later Hindu love-mysticism has something to do with this imagery of god's lilã. Of course, it must be conceded that the concept of l'Uà doss not explain away all the difficulties in connection with the question of god's motive for the creation of the world. For instance, it fails to rationalize the inequality and cruelty in the world. It would seem as if god's sportive instinct was governed by the universal moral law of Karma. At any rate, the concept of lilà cannot be said to con- stitute any serious philosophical doctrine ; it only serves as a fairly satisfactory analogy. Unlike many other religions, Hinduism is hardly ever represented as a system of ethics. Indeed, ethics occupies but a minor place in Hindu religious 1. Presumably^ it is in this sense that Taooue speaks of the similarity between the cosmic creation and the artistic création.</page><page sequence="20">452 ». ft. ĎANOEKltí ideology. By and large, Hindu thought does not make any sharp distinction between spirit and matter ; it thereby discards the very basis of morality. The pantheistic overtone of Hinduism must also be said to have been responsible for its amoralism. In this connection it is pertinently asked how a tide can sin against the sea. In Hindu thought, god is rarely conceived as a moral lord and governor. Hindu morality, accordingly, does not mean obedience to the will of god. Profound speculativeness is a distinctive mark of Hindu temperament, and this is reflected in the fact that Hindu religio-philosophical ideology has raised knowledge to a higher .pedestäl than either morality or devotional worship of god. Virtue is, no doubt desirable, but without true knowledge it is rendered futile. For a Hindu thinker the real sin is ignorance ; it is man's understanding which is involved in it and not his will. As has been very tellingly put, the badness of bad conduct lies in that it darkens the vision of truth. Socrates says that an enlightened person would generally do no wrong. The Hindu thinker seems to assert that a truly enlightened person is always right. According to the Hindu thought, salvation does not mean deliverance from sin against god ; it rather means freedom from avidyã. The consciousness of moral guilt becomes manifest relatively seldom, and the prayer is usually intended for vision rather than for pardon. The attitude of Hinduism in respect of morality is essentially polar. On the one hand, morality as such is believed to be in no way related either to religion oř to god. An immoral act, for instance, is not regarded as being necessarily irreligious. Even the Thugs could claim that their nefarious acti- vities were a part of their religion. A saint may be morally extravagant but he is nevertheless religiously much esteemed. For, it is through his rigorous asceticism, which may not be necessarily compatible with the conventional code of moral conduct, that the saint is believed to attain a direct insight into the divine mystery. Similarly, as has been already pointed out, morality, according to Hindu thought, does not amount to the conforming of one's conduct to the will of god. Nor does it imply obedience to a categorical imperative. At best, morality may be looked upon as an instrument of social adjustment. At the same time, Hinduism is seen to have gone to the other extreme m that it has elevated the doctrine of Karma, which is intensely ethi- cal, to the position of an irrefragable cosmic law. Though most of the Hindu gods have been invested with particular attributes and vehicles, their basic nature continues to be vague and imper- sonal. The individual gods cannot, accordingly, be sharply distinguished from one another. Nor can the mutual relationship among the various gods be said to be clearly defined. It may be further pointed out that the nature of individual gods is often submerged and lost in the exuberant mythology which</page><page sequence="21">öob In hîndu thought 453 has grown round them. Unlike the gods of same other religions, the charac- ter of a Hindu god as the creator of man and the universe is but little empha- sised. So far as Hinduism is concerned, it may be more apt to say that, instead of god having created man, man has created gods - and that too after his own image. Therefore, while, in one sense, the Hindu gods are vague and imper- sonal, in another sense, they tend to become almost identical with men. Many of man's special characteristics are seen also in gods. For one thing, gods, like men, are by no means wholly free and independent. They are not unoften represented as being subject to the law of Karman. Gods, like men, have their own peculiar religion to which they have to be loyal. Indeed, a Hindu god's nature is a curious mixture of the human, the mythological, and the philosophical. In the course of the development of various views regarding the gods of Hinduism, some landmarks are clearly noticeable. As has been already pointed out, in the early Vedic period, people celebrated many gods or devas - most of them anthropomorphic in character and most of them embodying the "asuistic" ideology - but no one god in the monotheistic sense. In the Upani- sads, the supreme being, which was emphatically asserted to be one and without a second, was more or less completely impersonalised. The classical Hinduism, which must be said to have largely inherited the religious ideology and prac- tice of the proto-historical Hinduism, manifested itself, in its initial stages, in the form of the two major sects, namely, Vaisnavism and Šaivism. These sects were almost monotheistic in character - they represented a kind of modified monotheism. Visnu and Siva were regarded as having, as it were, transcended the hierarchy of mythological gods, who were quite numerous, and were hea- ded by Indra, the king of gods, and his regents, the dikpãlas. Besides Vaisna- vism and Šaivism, there also emerged sects centering round other divinities like áakti, Sûrya, and Ganeša - each of them again representing a kind of modi- fied monotheism. It must, however, be stressed that these sects, howsoevermuch they differed from one another in respect of their strength and the extent of their influence, hardly ever sought to extinguish one another. On the other hand, in course of time and in conformity with the usual trend of development in Hinduism, the five cults, respectively centering round Sûrya, Ganesa, Visnu, Šiva, and áakti, instead of each of them having been regarded as absolute and independent, came to be regarded as constituting the five steps in a single religious echelon. In connection with the bhakti- cult in the Dravidian region, four gods are specially mentioned, namely, " the red one with blue throat " ( that is, Siva ), *' the white one of the ploughshare and the palmyra flag " ( that is Baladeva ), " the blue one with the eagle flag " ( that is, Krsna ), and " the</page><page sequence="22">454 ř. N. dandekab rider on the elephant with the peacock-flag " ( that is, Subrahmanya ). A re- ference may also be made here to gods like Brahma, Vàyu, Agni, Varuna, etc., who had no clearcut sectarian affiliations. Incidentally, some Buddhist sources speak of three classes of divinities, namely, ( i ) kings and holy men or pro- phets, ( ii ) deified heroes like Vãsudeva and Baladeva, and ( iii ) popular folk- divinities like sun, moon, fire, etc. A brief note on the female divinities in Hinduism would be quite apro- pos at this stage. So far as the proto-historical Hinduism is concerned, it is overwhelmingly dominated by the three-headed horned male god proto- éiva. But, as pointed out elsewhere, the worship of " mothers " also seems to have constituted a significant feature of that religion. As against this, in the hieratic Vedic religion, not much importance is attached to female divini- ties. Aditi in the Rgveda, for instance, is hardly ever invested with the per- sonality and character of the Mother-Goddess as such, while the character of Usas - as also of Prthivî - has been conceived by the Vedic poets as being little more than transparently naturalistic. Some of the other female divinities in the Veda are either mere colourless female counterparts or wives of male gods, or otherwise they represent the later deification of some abstract concepts. It would, indeed, seem that the distinctive religious ideology centering round the female divinities was essentially indigenous and that it forced itself into the Vedic ideology - though not to any large extent - as the inevitable result of the contact of the Vedic Aryans with the indigenous population of India. Two aspects of this ideology deserve to be specially noticed here. For one thing, these female divinities are mainly worshipped by the common folk. A men- tion may be made in this context of the grämcidevätäs - the mothers - like Mariamman and Kottavai of the Tamil country as also of the divinities like áitalà and Manasã. They are regarded specifically as " negative " divini- ties in the sense that they are prayed to not so much that they may bestow any positive good on the worshipper as that they may forestall the evils which are likely to befall him. Nirrti, Sinïvâlî, Kuhü, and Guñgü are presumably the Vedic reflections of some of such indigenous female divinities. It would also be seen that, in the Atharvaveda, spirits with feminine names were usually associated with diseases and disasters. Such " negative " female divinities are, indeed, quite numerous in popular Hinduism. The second aspect of the religious ideology relating to the female divi- nities is far more significant from the theological point of view. In this context, one may speak of one goddess rather than of many female divinities. This goddess usually represents the personification of the ''power" of the great god and is often regarded as his consort. The great god is, indeed, the self- sufficient, static aspect of the ultimate,, but he is believed to have a consort,</page><page sequence="23">GOD IK HINDU THOUGHT 455 who is both one with and subordinate to him and who alone Serves as the motive force behind the world-process. It is only through her that the sup- reme being becomcs involved in the cosmic activity. Such goddess, for instance, is Čakti. On the one hand, she personifies the creative as well as the destructive power of the great god &amp;iva, while, on the other, she is the great goddess - the mother goddess - in her own right and has an independent religious cult developed round her. In the Pãfícarãtra texts and the Purãnas, Laksmi is sometimes represented as the ¿aA-//-both from the formal and the material points of view - of Nãrâyana. It is through her that Nãrâyana passes from his transcendental and undifferentiated form to a form characterised by the six qualities of ai'svarya. The proto-historical counterpart of Šakti is not as distinctly represented as that of íiva, but the extent of her influence, even in the pre-Vcdic times, may very well be judged from such of her reflections in the Vedic literature as Vãk ( JtV X. 125 ) and Uma ( Kena-Upanlsad 25 ). Incidentally, it may be added that the two aspects of the religious ideology concerning the female divinities, which have been referred to above, are some- times seen to mingle with each other in a loose manner. In Hindu religious thought, the concept of Satan or Devil or Prince of Darkness as such hardly ever occurs with any prominence. A figure like that of the Buddhist Mara is absent in Hindu mythology. The sharp duality of superhuman powers with opposite moral qualities - the duality, that is to say, of powers of light and powers of darkness - as, for instance, in the Zoro- astrian ditheism, has never been the basis of Hindu religious ideology. The character of Vrtra or Ahi of the Rgveda whom Indra vanquishes is essen- tially different from that of the Devil. He can by no means be said to repre- sent evil personified in a single figure. The same thing may be said of Râvana, the adversary of Rãma in the Rämäyana. Indeed, Rãvana is often represented as a pious and learned Brãhmana. Many demoniac antagonists of divine powers have, no doubt, been mentioned in the Purànas. But they are often shown to possess several good features of character, and they are either quickly overpowered by the gods or actually become the worshippers of gods. Many of them have originally been great and noble persons, who, for some minor lapses, are cursed to be temporarily transformed into demons. The existence of evil is generally said to be the reason for the existence of religion. But this dictum does not seem to hold good in respect of Hinduism. The doctrine of avatàra or descent of god on the earth marks a new and fairly well-defined phase in the development of Hinduism. It may, how- ever, be pointed out at the very outset that the avatàra- theory has to be essen- tially differentiated from the primitive motif of a god descending to the earth. According to the Hindu conception, god actually appears on this earth íq</page><page sequence="24">456 R. N. DANDEKAR various forms at various times to fulfil certain specific purposes. Of course, in his incarnations, god does not appear in his highest form, which is indeed incomprehensible to the mortal eye. He assumes a mortal form ( either human or animal ), but, even in that form, his transcendental power becomes unmis- takably manifest. The avatãra is not to be understood merely as a transitory manifestation of the deity; it represents a mystic but real presence of the supreme being in a mortal body. The anthropomorphism ( or, in a few cases, the zoomorphism ) is complete in every respect, but there becomes clearly evident a union of infinite divinity on the one hand and finite individuality on the other. The avatàras must be said to be a special characteristic of Vaisnavism. However, the classical theory in this respect does not seem to have been for- mulated in the epic period. The Mahãbhãrata, for instance, does not contain any systematic account of the avatàras . It is in the Purãnas that the scheme of the ten avatàras is fully developed. Indeed, the treatment of this subject in some Purànic passages is quite diversified and they give lists of avatàras other than the classical ten. The ten incarnations, in which Visnu is, accord- ing to the normal classical tradition, believed to have appeared on this earth, are : Fish ( Matsya ), Tortoise { Kùrma ), Boar ( Varãha ), Man-Lion ( Nara - simha ), Vamana, Parasuràma, Rama, Krsna, the Buddha, and Kalki. Rama is sometimes regarded as only a partial avatàra - one half of the divinity haying been divided among his brothers. Two other points in connection with Rama are noteworthy : firstly, there is no Purãna exclusively dedicated to Ráma ( presumably because Ràma-worship did not offer much scope for Purànic sectarianism); and, secondly, the divine personality of Ráma had been so conceived that it could be conveniently combined with any other god, even with Šiva ( as has been testified by the figure of Ràmesvara ). As against Ráma, Krsna is celebrated as a full incarnation or pûrnàvatàra. As a matter of fact, in some accounts, Balaràma ( Krsna's elder brother ) is substituted for Krsna as avatãra , for, the latter is believed to be god himself and not his avatàra . In some other avflfãra-lists, Krsna is mentioned after Balaràma or in the place of Balaràma or in the place of the Buddha. In the Buddha-incarnation, Visnu is supposed to have been born as the " Deluder " in order to mislead the demons with false doctrine and thereby bring about their undoing. That avatàra may also be regarded as being in- tended for recognizing the personal greatness of the Buddha while, at the same time, deprecating his teachings. The tenth and last avatãra , namely, Kalki, is to appear at the end of the present Kali-epoch. Riding a horse called Devadatta, Kalki will overrun the earth, put an end to all evil powers, and re-establish moral order.</page><page sequence="25">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 457 The germs of some of the avatãras of Visnu, such as Matsya, Kürma, Varàha, and Vãmana, may be discovered in the Vedic legends. In some cases, the forms which the Prajãpati of Vedism is seen to have assumed on different occasions have been transferred to the Visnu of Hinduism. It is, however, not improbable that Vedism itself had borrowed those ideas from the proto- Indian religious thought-complex. We also find that several peculiar features of Vedic Visnu's personality and character are reflected in his classical Hindu avatar as. Incidentally, it may be pointed out that the Avestan Verethragna is also said to have appeared in ten incarnations and that some scholars like Charpentier and Benveniste are inclined to connect these incarnations with the avatãras of Visnu. Further, it is not unlikely that the Hindu avatãra - theory, the Jaina tradition of the Tirthamkaras, and the Buddhist concep- tion of the Buddha's many births have some genetical relationship. The Hindu theory of avatãras is significant from various points of view. Tò begin with, it is always asserted that the main purpose for which Visnu appeared in his various incarnations was to establish moral order in a world which had become spiritually dissolute. As the Bhagavadgitã (IV. 7 ) says: Whenever righteousness languishes and unrighteousness thrives, then does god incarnate himself. This moral aspect of the avatãra - theory is empha- sized in another way as well, namely, by suggesting that god, appearing in his avatãra , placed before man a norm which might help the latter in properly orienting his spiritual quest. God is believed to have come to man in order that man might become god by following his example. The descent of the Divine is regarded as having been intended for promoting the ascent of the individual. In this context, Ráma was often represented as the absolute ideal for all humanity, for, the Rãmãyana seems to have portrayed Râma as a man who became god rather than as god who had incarnated himself as man. The avatãra- theory also facilitated the transcendent being brought into direct relation with the phenomenal world. It is suggested that, from his eternal existence as an incomprehensible undivided unity god descended into the existence characterised by time and history and thereby invested with some meaning the otherwise meaningless cycles of time. The avatãra-thtoty was a grand attempt by the religionist to personalize the impersonal reality of the philosopher, not only conceptually but also empirically. It afforded the unique experience of the One co-existing with the Many, and thereby helped the consolidation of the doctrine of bhakti. For, the motive for the avatãras , which was stressed as strongly and as often as the establishment of Dharma, was god's desire to show grace and do good to those who were devoted to him and whom he loved. Psychologically, a single god manifest- ing himself in various forms must have adequately met the fancies of different ▲pom 58</page><page sequence="26">458 E. N. DAN DUE AB kinds of people. The tfvtitöra-theory also served, from time to time, as an assurance, which was perhaps psychologically much needed, that god did not remain merely an indiffèrent and uninterested spectator of the world-process but that he duly recognized his role of responsible involvement in it. From the point of view of the history of Hinduism the avatãra-thzory may be regarded as a major factor in the religious synthesis brought about by that religion. Originally, the different divinities like Ráma, Krsna, Parasu- ràma, etc., seem to have been the gods of different religious cults. When, in the course of thé religious history of India, these cults federated themselves to form what came to be known as Hinduism, some kind of unity of godhead was sought to be achieved by those gods being represented as the incarnations of one single god Visnu. On the other hand, this also helped to elevate the status of the objects of worship of certain primitive cults. It may be further noted that the avatàra- theory generally tended to supersede the philosophi- ¿al pantheism and to promote some kind of theology approaching monothei- sm or at least polytheism organized under a single god. Incidentally, a refer- ence may also be irçade here to the supposition that the sequence of the ten àvatàras reflects the various stages in the evolution of man himself. Among other concepts, which are in some way related to the concept of avatàra but which must needs be essentially differentiated from it, may be mentioned those of pràdurbhàva wherein god manifests himself while remain- ing transcendent in his true form ; tanùs or appearances in certain specific aspects which latter may be co-existent ( this concept having been developed more particularly in Šaivism) ; àveba or entering into and getting possession of some pratika ; vibhùtis or special manifestations in eminent entities ; vyîihas or cosmological and psychological emanations of the supreme being; vibhava or incarnate form which god, in his grace, assumes, from time to time, in order to be accessible to his devotees ; antaryamin or god as the inner self of man ; and urea or the idol-form of god. One of the striking features of popular Hinduism, as against Vedism which may, in a sense, be said to have culminated in Upanisadic spiritualism* is that it seeks to substitute a religion as contemplation by a religion as pra- ctice. It is in this context that a study of the Hindu concept of worship becomes relevant. The Vedic Aryan religious practice was mainly of the nature of homa, that is, of the offering of oblations to gods, who were not clirectly present before the sacrificer in the form of idols or images, on the sacred fires in the accompaniment of Vedic mantras. With the advent of historical Hinduism, Vedic homa or ritual came to be more or less superseded by a form of worship popularly known as puja. The centre of the entire procedure of pujawas the idol or the image or some other concrete symbol of</page><page sequence="27">Cl OD IN HINDU THOUGHT 459 the divinity, which was ceremonially bathed and anointed with sandalwood- paste or coloured powder and to which offerings of flowers, food, milk", sweets, etc., were made in the accompaniment of the recital of mantras and prayers, the ringing of bells and the burning of lights and incense. Actually the pre-Vedic non-Aryan religion-that is to say, proto- historical Hinduism- also seems to have been characterised by some kind of jeligious practice ak- in to puja. Naturally enough, during the Vedic interlude, homa or Vedic ritual came to be generally recognized as the representative religious practice. But in classical Hinduism pujä was again revived in a highly developed and complex form. A third kind of religious practice which may be referred to here consisted of Tãntric ritual and worship. A distinctive characteristic of Hindu pujä is that, in essence, it is à personal activity rather than a congregational or communal performance. For a Hindu, pujä is an individual experience ; it is an act of private devo- tion. Temple-worship is, of course, not uncommon, but it cannot be said to be an essential constituent of Hindu religious practice. The piety of a Hindu is by no means dependent on his visiting a temple and offering worship there. Indeed, many devout Hindus prefer home-worship to temple-worship. It may, however, be noted that the basic pattern õf temple-worship is more or less the same as the one indicated above. Naturally enough, in temple-wor- ship, the devotees have usually to be content with being mere spectators of rather than active participants in the procedure of worship.' Even in the case of home-worship it is only one member of the family who offers worship for the whole family. Thus, in the ultimate analysis, the individual's part in worship is limited mainly to his own contemplation of and prayer to the divi- nity. In this connection a special mention must be made of japa or the repeated murmuring of the name of god which is believed to possess deep religio-magical significance. As for prayer, the religious man seeks to esta- blish, by means of it, a living communion with god conceived as personal and present in experience. It implies, on the one hand, an unflinching faith in god's grace, and, on the other, one's complete surrender to his mercy. Such individual worship is perhaps of greater spiritual value; but there is no doubt that the absence of any obligatory worship of a congregational type has, to a certain extent, adversely affected the religio-social cohesion and integration among the Hindus. Hinduism certainly provides for such religious affairs of a communal nature as the recital and exposition of epic and Purã- nic texts and works of religio-philosophical import, seasonal festivals, and pilgrimages to sacred places. But these can by no means be said to constitute the essentials of religious practice. Nor are they, in any sense, obligatory.</page><page sequence="28">460 it. It. ďanďekáb Though, as has been pointed •¿mt above, the basic pattern of Hindu worship is more or less fixed, there are often made in it numerous and minut? variations in accordance with the different cults, different divinities, and diffe- rent occasions. Indeed, one often wonders whether the diversity of Hindu Worship does not actually exceed the diversity of Hindu doctrine. A reference to the ritual and worship sponsored by the Tantra schools would.be quite relevant in this context. The Tantric ritual and worship are more rigorously organized than the normal Hindu ritual and worship. The Tantras do not make any distinction in the matter of religious practice on the basis of caste and sex. Their ritual is essentially of an esoteric character and its knowledge is usually transmitted and preserved through a strict teacher-pupil tradition. It comprises of various sexual, orgiastic, and bloody rites. One of the basic assumptions of the Tantras relates to the almost organic correspondence bet- ween man and the universe ; and, on the strength of this assumption, the prac- titioner of Tantric rites seeks to control the universe through the control of his own body. The Tantras also emphasise the religio-magical potence of such items of worship as mantra , yantra, bija , etc. Indeed, the Tantras believe in .magically compelling the divine powers rather than religiously propitiating them. It has been stated elsewhere that, from the strict philosophical point of view, god is only relatively real; that is to say, he is real only on the pheno- menal plane. Worship of god cannot, accordingly, be regarded as of ultimate spiritual value. The Brhadàranyaka-Upanisad (1.4.10), for instance, says: " Whoever worships another divinity ( than his self ) thinking that he (=god) is one and he himself another, he knows not. " Actually the same Upanisadic passage further suggests that gods do not like that men should know the ulti- mate truth of transcendental Unity, for, then they would know gods to hold but a subordinate position and so cease offering worship to them. Notwith- standing this predominating philosophical attitude which tends to look upon all rules, rites, and creeds as being part of a lower and temporal order of things, the Hindu is normally not half-hearted in respect of his worldly obli- gations. His devotion to god and his zeal and earnestness in the matter of worship cannot brook being called in question. The worship of god reflects his genuine response to the supreme reality as conceived on the empirical plane - a response of fear, hope, love, and trust. Hindu worship is also regarded as an efficacious means of moral disci- pline and spiritual fortification which human life so badly needs. Indeed, Hindu worship has a very wide connotation. It does not necessarily imply some deliberate act of devotion. As the Bhagavadgitã proclaims, one who per- forms his- prescribed duties exclusively for the sake of lokasamgraha and with-</page><page sequence="29">ÖÖO IN HINDU THOUGH* 461 out being selfishly attached to their fruits must be deemed to be offering the most devout and the most agreeable worship to god. Whatever one does in the spirit of true anãsakti-yoga is in essence an act of worship. The doctrine of grace must, indeed, be regarded as an essential consti- tuent of theistic ideology. Some intimation of this doctrine may be discover- ed in such R.gvedic references as that Varuna chose Vasistha for his exclusive companionship and, through his majesty, made him a true seer ( VII. 88.4 ) . But it makes its appearance in a fairly developed form, for the first time, only in the later religiously oriented Upanisads. Already in the Katha-Upanisad ( I. 2.23 ) we are told that this supreme self ' cannot be attained by instruc- tion, nor by intellectual power, nor even through much hearing. He is to be attained only by the one whom he chooses. ' The Mundcika-Upanisad (III.2.3) repeats the same view. But the Évetàsvatara-Upanisad is perhaps more expli- cit on this point. At one place ( 1.6 ), for instance, it says that the self bless- ed by the Lord, the Mover (preritã), gains life eternal, while, at another ( III.20 ), it actually speaks of dhàtuh prasãda or the grace of the creator. The doctrine of grace forms an integral part of the teaching of the Bhagavadgitã. One of the principal attributes of god in the Bhagavadgitã is love for his devotee. Indeed, god is said to be the friend of all beings ( V.29 ) and to be actively helping man in freeing himself from the samsara. Several times in the poem is Lord Krsria seen to have assured Arjuna that ' for whomsoever attains to him there does not remain any re-birth' ( VII. 16 ). Mainly through god's grace does one win the eternal immutable realm. So, almost by way of his final precept, Krsna urges Arjuna to relinquish all the religious duties and betake himself only to him. He alone shall deliver him from all sins whatsoever ( XVI1I.66 ). In the epics, and more particularly in the Puränas , divine grace is a frequently occurring religious motif. God is said to have assumed finite forms for the sake of love for his worshippers and in order to free them from the shackles of this worldly existence. In the Pañcaratra scriptures, this function of freeing the devotee from samsara is ascribed to the sudarsana portion, of Laksmï, the transcendent character af the supreme lord himself being thereby scrupulously maintained. The sudarsana is represented as operating like god's grace and as gradually leading the self on the way to moksa or deli- verance. Incidentally, however, it may be pointed out that, just as god is endowed with the attribute of anugraha or grace, he is also endowed with the attribute of nigraha or the power of obstruction by means of which he keeps man bound down to samsara. In the course of the further development of Vaisnava theism, the doctrine of grace became so basic a theme of its teaching that it came to be unequivocally claimed, as, for instance; in the Nãrãyaníya</page><page sequence="30">462 fi. N. DANDEKAB ( 349.75,76 ), that one could attain religious enlightenment not through penance or knowledge or the like, but only as the result of the compassion of Nãrãyana. The Bhãgavata-Purãna glorifies the grace of god as the very crown and consummation of religion. God is god by nature, but man, who is man by nature, can become god by nature through the grace of god. The Âlvars sing of god as being condescendingly merciful even to the lowliest among men and bestowing on him his grace. Rãraànuja, who seeks to give a philosophical foundation to the theistic ideology, has to encounter the problem of the co-ordination of the two con- cepts, namely, the grace of god and the law of Karma. With reference to the statement in the Kausitaki-U pani sad (III.8) that ' this one (that is, the supreme being ), truly, causes him, whom hewishes to lead up from these worlds, to perform good actions; this one, indeed, also causes him, whom he wishes to lead downward, to perform bad action, ' he seems to suggest that god's grace does not operate arbitrarily but that it does so in accordance with the law of Karma. This does not, however, imply that the law of Karma is something external to or independent of god. It is itself the expression of god's mode of action. God is the source and substratum of both grace and law of Karma. There is, therefore, no question of one of these two being subservient to the other. Gód often employs the law of Karma as a kind of testing exercise for one to whom grace is to be ultimately shown. As hinted at in the Bhagavad- gïtà ( VI.41-43 ), the samsara, which is the inevitable consequence of the law" of Karma, is intended to afford to man an opportunity to qualify himself for god's grace, for moksa. In other words, man is subjected to the law of Karma because of god's desire to show him grace and not in spite of it. A reference may be made, iù this very context, to the two major schools of the Vaisnava theology propounded by Ràmãnuja. The southern school or the Tengalais in- sisted that prapatti or complete surrender by the self to god was the only way for obtaining god's grace. This school is credited with having explained the devotee's relationship with god in this connection by the mãrjãranyàya or the cab-analogy. Just as the kitten remained passive and self-surrendering while its mother carried it about in her mouth, in the same way the devotee was re- quired to do nothing for his salvation except completely giving himself up to the mercy of god. The northern school or the Vadgalais, on the other hand, took recourse to the markaíanyãya or the monkey-analogy in order to explain the relationship between the worshipper and god. The young one of a monkey had to exert itself- to some extent to stay clinging to its mother while being carried about. Likewise the devotee could not depend on mere passive sub- mission to god for his emancipation, but was required to resort also to Other ways of salvation prescribed by the scriptures.</page><page sequence="31">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 463 Incidentally, it may be added that, even in the Šaiva theism, the great- est attribute of éiva is believed to be love, and the soul (pasu) is said to be dependent for its liberation from the threefold fetter (pãsa ) of maya , karman , and aitava entirely on the grace of áiva. While speaking of liberation ( moksa ) one must clearly realise the dis- tinction between its theistic concept and its metaphysical concept. From the strictly advaitic point of "view, moksa does not imply any new state of being to be attained by the soul. Indeed, it denotes its original state of being - the state of what is catchingly called the " pťe-biographical unity " - which it tem- porarily forfeits as the result of ignorance but which it is entitled to regain through true knowledge. In tbis state, the soul transcends time, space, and causality, which characterise the phenomenal world. It fuses into the absolute and is thus freed from any further possibility of rebirth. Moksa , in this sense, has hardly anything to do with god. But religious theism does not counte- nance the illusion of the individual self implied by advaitic absolutism. Moksa , according to theism, represents a specific kind of relationship between god and the soul. The world-process, as has been already pointed out, is an uuending cycle of emanations and reabsorptions, and the aim of religion is some kind of union or clo$e association of the soul with god beyond that cycle. It is also suggested that, through deep contemplation of god, one actually becomes either god or like god. But, generally, in Hindu theism, moksa is not under- stood either as union with or fusion into or identification with god. It rather means isolation - the isolation of the self from all other things such as the world and the other selves. It is, indeed, the isolation of the soul in its es- sence. This kind of liberation is believed to be more desirable than either the annihilation of the soul or its absorption into the vaster spirituality of Brah- man. The soul is eternal ; it has its true being beyond time and space. It is just in this sense that the soul is said to participate in divine nature. And, thus participating in divine nature, it ' persists 9 even in the state of liberation. Freed from evil of all kind and having attained all desires, through the grace of god, the soul becomes isolated from the associations of the manifested world, and yet continues to experience the unending and ever- increasing love of god. All Hindu mysticism aims at the transcendence of personality by the soul, either through the realisation of complete unity with the universal spiri- tuality or through the total isolation of the eternal in the soul from the tem- poral in it. There has, however, been often mentioned still another type of mysticism, namely, loving communion with god even during the state of embodied existence. It is in view of this that one speaks of ' impersonal ' mysticism and ' personal • mysticism. But, in the ultimate analysis, the ç*-</page><page sequence="32">464 R. N. DANDBKAB perience of mysticism is essentially uniform, though that experience is expre- ssed in different ways, such as, through silence or negation or contradiction or superlation. Hindu mysticism transcends the tyranny of words usually encouraged by philosophical dogmas or religious doctrines. It is, indeed, from its mysticism that Hinduism has derived its unique attitude of tolerance. In the history of Hinduism, man's attitude towards god has undergone many changes. However, three principal landmarks may be specially noted in this connection. In the early Vcdic period, man sought to exert on gods a kind of magically compulsive influence by means of his word ( brahman or mantra ) and action ( yajña or ritual). In the Upanisadic period, knowledge of god - or, to be more precise, of the supreme being - came to be regarded as the only source of salvation and eternal bliss - though, incidentally, even then, the magic potence of knowledge was duly emphasised. To know was to attain - indeed, to know was to become. Desire for knowledge, respect for knowledge, and trust in the practical rcligio-philosophical efficacy of knowledge - these continued to be the distinctive features of Hinduism throughout its history. This knowledge-partial attitude of the Hindu was often carried to such an extreme that he not unoftcn posited and logically sub- stantiated a religion without a god, and persisted in regarding ignorance as a more grievous sin than even the most serious moral lapse. It is, indeed, on account of this that Hinduism is frequently - though not always justi- fiably - characterised as ' wisdom ' rather than ' spirituality .' With popular Hinduism, bhakti or passionate devotion to god became the watchword of religion. Bhakti necessarily presupposes the './¿lief in a personal god, who is often a divinity of a popular cult elevated to the status of the supreme being. Before this personal god, man experiences the feeling of moral inferiority, spiritual imperfection, helplessness, and humility. He, however, has unquestioned faith in the grace of. god, and, therefore, surren- ders before him in a completely self-oblivious manner, hoping thereby to achieve a direct mystic communion with him, which, for a bhakta, constitutes the ultimate spiritual goal. Some traces of this emotional theism may be discovered in a few hymns of the Rgveda ¡ particularly those addressed by Vasistha to Varuna, but it is in the S veta s vat ara- U pani sad that it seems to have been first formulated into a religious doctrine. The rise of various Hindu sects gave a fillip to the growth of bhakti', and the Purãnic tradition that bhakti was bom in the Dravidian country gets historical confirmation from the fact that the two principal and more or less parallel currents of early medieval theism, namely. Va ispavism and Šaivism, had their main spring in southern India.</page><page sequence="33">GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 465 The religion of bhakti generally substituted theology for mythology, but its most outstanding achievement was that it sought to establish the equa- lity of all persons, irrespective of caste, creed, and sex, in the sight of god. Of course, both mythology and social distinctions proved too tenacious to be so easily stifled. The role of bhakti in the history of Hinduism may be said to have been self-contradictory. On the one hand, the doctrine of bhakti served as a unifying force among the Hindu masses who were rallied together, under the banner of religious equality and brotherhood, to counteract the exclusivism of Vedism-Brahmanism, while, on the other hand, the various sects which sponsored that doctrine, each in its own way, tended, in course of time, to consolidate themselves into different castes and thereby encourage the fissi- parous trends in the Hindu society. And now to revert to the question with which we started, namely, whe- ther the belief in god can be generally said to constitute the primary principle of Hinduism. Hindu thinkers, as will have been seen, do not start with the certainty of god. They seem to accept god only as a hypothesis which is not unworkable. The historical process of the phenomenal world and man are not dependent on god ; on the contrary, gods themselves are believed to be sub- ject to some universal law like the law of Karma. The concept of god is thus by no means central to Hinduism. The Hindu thinker begins with the ex- perience which is most immediate to him, namely, the self. He construes god and the phenomenal world with reference to the self - though, it must be emphasized, his Weltanschauung has not thereby become ant hropocen trie. The German philosopher Feuerbach says : " God is my first thought, the world my next, and man my third and last. " In his religious quest, the Hindu thinker must be said to have proceeded the other way round.</page></plain_text>
