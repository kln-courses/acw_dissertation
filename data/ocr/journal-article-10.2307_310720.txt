<plain_text><page sequence="1">FATE, GOOD, AND EVIL, IN EARLY GREEK POETRY BY WILLIAM CHASE GREENE THAT this is on the whole a good world, and that man is on the whole happy, we are generally agreed; at least man struggles to prolong his life on the assumption that life is worth living. Yet he is confronted also by pain and sorrow and vice, and their origins are often obscure; even good is sometimes turned to evil; even evil seems some- times mysteriously to contain elements of good. We assume that everything must have its cause, and we ordinarily push the ultimate cause of all things back to God. Yet this very assumption results in making God responsible for evil as well as for good, and at least raises the question whether man is responsible for his actions, good or evil. Shall we suppose that God is imperfectly good, or that He is good but not omnipotent? Shall we set Fate above God? Shall we suppose that God is still developing, or is manifesting Himself only gradually? Shall we break the world apart, and recognize a Devil as well as a God? Shall we, in order to preserve the freedom of the human will and its goodness, dispense with divinity, and recognize only a mate- rial universe in which moral values are of purely human origin and relevance? These are not new questions. They troubled the Greeks,' and have lifted their heads in almost every succeeding age, to the confusion of philosophy, theology, and practical affairs. But the problem is per- haps simpler in the world of the Greeks, and often more concrete. Why is it, we may ask with Butcher,2 that the Greeks, on the whole a healthy, cheerful, successful people, were nevertheless constantly 1 E. Renan strangely failed to perceive this; cf. his Les ApOtres (Paris, 1899), PP. 324; 328; 339; and J. Girard, Le Sentiment religieux en Grice2 (Paris, 1879), p. 6. 2 S. H.

On the other hand, why does their tragic drama, dealing largely with suffering and evil, give pleasure? How do their thinkers contrive to explain the persistence of evil in an orderly, rational universe? Or do they, indeed, explain it? The problem, thus simplified, is at least intelligible. Yet it is not wholly simple, for the various phases of the problem arise at different times and in different ways. The instinct of the Greeks, as of all men, would be to dwell on the goodness and activity of Nature and of what- ever powers there be in the world, rather than to stress the evil, thwarting powers and the oppressiveness of Law; we think more easily in positive than in negative terms. It would be only after the general goodness and rationality of the prevailing power had been already accepted and was perceived to be vitiated by the existence of evil that a problem of evil could arise; and it would be only persistent suffering that would arouse a suspicion that there may be some evil power at work. Injustice would not be imputed to the gods if justice had not generally been taken for granted. Moreover there could be no question of the freedom of the will if there were not already an idea of law or causality, a determinism against which freedom could be measured or contrasted. Whether this standard was identified with the will of the gods, as usually by the poets, or with law or power of a less personal sort, as by the philosophers, or with Fate, as by men generally, it provided a background against which the strength of men's wills and their sense of their own deserts might be set forth, as the conception of human personality and the value of human objec- tives were being defined in the process of living. Thus the moral struggles of life, and their counterpart on the tragic stage and in the pages of the philosophers and historians, were made possible. Pres- ently, as faith in the existence of an external moral order was abated, man assumed for a time the helm of his destiny. At a later period, Chance, a creature with little moral character, came to hold a greater sway in his imaginings. Finally, in the decay of the ancient world, recourse was had once more to the simpler forms of religious faith, or to a philosophic interpretation of Fate. It is with the whole conception of Fate and its relation to Good and Evil, and of Physis to Themis and Nomos, so far as Greek thought is concerned, that any adequate study of the problem must attempt</page><page sequence="3">Fate, Good, and Evil, in Early Greek Poetry 3 to deal. With the gods it must necessarily concern itself, from time to time, but only as they are involved in the conception of Fate, of what must be. In the present study the field is limited to the poets from Homer through Theognis; the philosophers, the Orphic move- ment, the beginnings of drama, Simonides, Pindar, and Bacchylides all lie outside of this consideration. Yet it will be seen that enough remains to give a fair impression of the continuous stream of ideas that dominated the ordinary attitude of the Greeks almost to the beginning of the fifth century B.C., and that influenced all later Greek literature. Of pre-Homeric experience it must suffice here if we recognize in the Homeric poems faint traces, as we recognize in ritual survivals of the historic period clear tokens, of a dependence on the powers of Nature, the universal Mother, a daimon dispensing food and warmth and shelter, hardship and suffering, a force wonderful in her variety, a force neither wholly good nor wholly evil. She continued through the cycle of days and months and years, and her way was the way of Dike.' As Mother Earth, she received the rites that were supposed to bring food; and offshoots of divinity were felt in the baleful Keres and the vengeful Erinyes and other daimones. Even when Zeus and the Olympians had dethroned the older daimones and done battle with the Titans, even after Themis, the new divine counterpart of hu- man ideals of conduct, had been wedded to Zeus and eclipsed Dike, the Way of Things, the new dynasty found themselves compelled to as- sume, along with their r6le as anthropomorphic beings, something of the r6le of the older nature-gods. The new dynasty, to be sure, had also once been for the most part nature-gods, but were trying to forget their earlier functions and become gods of the social order. That the older daimones, representing the divine life-force, the power of Physis, could well afford to bide their time till the days of the Orphic move- ment, when the inadequacy of the Olympians should have become apparent, is not of immediate concern to us. What is to our purpose is to observe that it was precisely the dual role of the Olympians, or more particularly of Zeus, that first made acute the problem of evil. 1 Cf. R. Hirzel, Themis, Dike und Verwandles (Leipzig, 1907), pp. 56-64; 210o- 227; J. E. Harrison, Themis (Cambridge, 1912), pp. 516-518.</page><page sequence="4">4 William Chase Greene We may waive the moral inadequacy of the gods, their lack of true affection for men, their failure to maintain justice in this world or in another world, the polytheistic system or lack of system; these blemishes the Greeks could in time recognize, and in the course of centuries they did to some extent purify their theology. But the dual r61e of Zeus, who besides pretending to hold the sceptre of law and justice over his own r6gime, which is a "succession monarchy" founded on the debris of a great war, has perforce to assume the liabilities of his predecessors, makes him both arbiter of justice and weather god. And this ascription to Zeus of responsibility for the proc- esses of nature, apparently so obvious and so religious a point of view (does not Job's Jehovah speak "out of the whirlwind?" 1), is really charged with a dangerous explosive power. To the extent to which the Olympic gods take over the nature religion and express it in anthropomorphic form, to that extent they are unmoral, if not posi- tively vicious. The rain falls alike upon the just and upon the unjust; the thunder and the lightning strike the good and the evil alike. Let this remain a matter of blind Nature's power, which knows nothing of human distinctions, and no harm is done to our moral sense; Nature knows no better. But give this same power to gods in our own form, recognizing our standards of good and evil, and we are confronted by gods who are arbitrary and capricious when they are not passionate and cruel. Translate into human terms the various fertility-cults that are supposed to prosper the crops, and we shall have polygamous gods, fickle gods, gods of whose powers we shall often have reason to be sceptical. For like political parties that claim the credit for a period of prosperity, the human gods of Homer must also assume the blame for catastrophes and periods of depression. Monarchs who reign but do not rule, delegating their authority to ministers, evade having imputed to them the responsibility for all imperfections, as does the divine creator in Plato's Timaeus. Homer's less calculated solution is perhaps polytheism and divided responsibility, and an occasional re- course to Moira. Some imputation of evil, moreover, Zeus escapes by not being the creator of the kosmos; he uses the materials provided by his predecessors. 1 Job, 38, I.</page><page sequence="5">Fate, Good, and Evil, in Early Greek Poetry 5 Even after the gods have been differentiated, the idea of power lingering in the vaguer daimon often provides an easier explanation of the divine cause of things than could some more departmentalized god in human form, and thus comes near to standing for the idea of Fate; in particular it emphasizes what is external to a man's will, what he does in passion or infatuation. And since it is in times of mis- fortune, rather than of normal prosperity, that men are most apt to suppose that higher powers have actually interfered,' the tendency in Greek literature from Homer down is to attribute to "the daimon," or to some unnamed god, or to the gods collectively, whatever arises to thwart the will or hopes of men, as well as whatever sudden inspira- tion occurs to them. Already the daimon seems to have gone far on the path from the r6le of divinity to the r6le of devil (the later demon). In Homer, however, the problem of evil is not solved by a simple re- course to a dualistic separation between powers of light and powers of darkness, as in various oriental religions. In only one passage does Homer seem to adopt so drastic a solution: "a hateful daimon at- tacked him . . . but the gods delivered him from evil." 2 Even here, however, the daimon does only what an angry god might elsewhere do. Homer's daimon, like his Moira, is inscrutable, and at times hos- tile; his gods have human failings. But Homer has no absolutely evil god, no devil, unless it be Ate; and her r6le is, after all, a minor one.3 Beyond the carrying out of momentary purposes, have Homer's gods any more far-reaching purpose? There is, of course, the Dios Boule; 4 and it has been observed that when the gods act collectively they show "a certain gravity, a sense of duty, and consciousness of moral responsibility for the use of their power over men." 5 And there stands behind the gods a shadowy power, at times just, at times dread- ful and oppressive, the power of Moira. If Dike, in the pre-Homeric world, stands for a rhythm in the time-flow of things, Moira suggests their orderly division in space - men's lands and just portions, the r6les and prerogatives of men and gods.6 It is almost equivalent to 1 Cf.

Mutzbauer), noting first</page><page sequence="6">6 William Chase Greene Physis; as Hermes shows Odysseus the physis of the plant moly,' so Penelope remarks to him that men cannot keep awake indefinitely, "since the immortals have made for mortals a moira for each thing," 2 which is as much as to say that "you can't fight against Nature." The exact color of the word moira depends, of course, on its context in each case; sometimes neutral, sometimes suggesting what must be and therefore should be, it often tends, particularly when it refers to the one lot that all must accept, the poZpa 0av~rov, to acquire, like daimon, an unfavorable meaning, and is given uncomplimentary epi- thets.3 Thus in a polytheistic world Moira keeps order and assigns limits; she is just, or at least not capricious; not yet has the word tyche come into use. So far the idea of Fate has ethical possibilities; but is Moira fundamentally good? And how is she related to the gods? Is she identical with their will? The question, like others of a metaphysical character, is largely verbal; yet it cannot be evaded. The fundamental task of assembling passages that bear on the question was done by Naigelsbach; 4 and although he forced on Homer a greater degree of logical consistency than is to be expected of the poet, whose attitude is one of religious the definition of the Etymologicum Magnum, and the abundant Homeric examples; see also s.vv. p6pos and Eiiapguv'n. The stems of these words, as is universally recog- nized, are derived from the verb puepouaa, "receive one's portion." F. M. Corn- ford, and Mauss and Durkheim (cited by G. Murray, The Rise of the Greek Epic2 (Oxford, 1911), Appendix D, p. 337) trace uoZpa to the special divisions or portions of primitive tribes, and the shares of land, etc. that they held. (N6uos, "law," is similarly akin to voli", "pasture.") For Aisa, often equivalent to Moira, see Ebel- ing, s.v. ataa (by B. Giseke), connecting the stem with 'krn, "equal," i.e., "a just share." See further s.v. wrb'ros (Giseke), cognate of 7rirrco "befal" (cf. Latin casus); i.e., a "chance," or "doom," never of good luck; and s.v. rerpwoEi'vov (Giseke), from stem 7rop-, "give," "bestow"; hence "what is accomplished, predestined." Cf. also C.

Both express the cause of events which man is powerless to alter, and it is only the demand of the story that determines whether the more abstract or the more vividly personified agent shall be in- voked on a given occasion. Sometimes a traditional formula, express- ing the r6le of fate or of a god respectively, and ready to hand, may determine in a given line which turn of expression is the more con- venient for the exigency of an oral versifier. But at the critical mo- ments of the poems the will of Zeus tends to be connected with Moira or with other impersonal agencies, probably pre-Homeric, and among them the Keres and Erinyes of primitive faith, now partly moralized as upholders of the natural and the social orders. It seems likely that the figure of the Jars, in the great speech of Achilles,1 in which evils outnumber blessings two to one, is a tradi- tional one, and is the germ of the single Jar of Pandora, containing only evils, by which Hesiod was to account in part for the evil in the world.2 Traditional, too, in all probability, is the other principal figure by which Zeus is represented as the chief dispenser of good and evil, the "golden scales." 3 Nilsson calls it "a worn and old idea" drawn from Mycenaean times, and illustrates it by reference to a Mycenaean vase-painting which he dates about 1300 B.c.4 The poet, and perhaps the painter of the vase, is not suggesting that Zeus is in doubt as to the issue and is leaving the decision to something ex- ternal; for the fate of Hector, at any rate, was already settled,5 and the scales serve but to dramatize the turn in the tide of battle. Nor are the scales symbolic, like the "Scales of Justice," of any specially moral purpose; emphasizing tragic events which are essential to the story, they suggest, like the Jars and the spinning of the Fates 1 I1. 24, 525-533. 2 See below, pp. 15 f. 3 II. 8, 69-72; 22, 209-213; cf. 16, 658; 19, 223 f.; Hornm.

Other symbols of the power of Zeus and Moira are to be found not only in the fully individualized gods who often act as their agents but also in vaguer powers and attitudes. To the gods is imputed the human attitude that resents hybris, the feeling of nemesis, just indig- nation against sin.2 Yet there lingers also among them a trace of the more primitive anger of the gods, - vindictive rage, jealousy of prosperity, niggardliness, - that was to appear in later times as the 066vog r-ov OECop,3 and that explains much of the typical Greek attitude of moderation, scrupulous care not to offend the gods, as well as mel- ancholy or resignation. Nevertheless men are guilty of hybris and there must be a reason. In fact Homer recognizes two reasons: the abuse of the human free- dom of the will, resulting in a hardened character, which is atasthalie; and something so terrible, so blinding, that men would fain disown it and impute it to the gods, the heaven-sent power of evil, which is Ate. Here, at last, is something satanic, a very Devil, who beguiles at times even the gods; and Zeus in turn would fain disown her,4 though he employs her for ends beyond men's understanding. However much the r61e of Ate in men's moral downfall was to be justified and regular- ized by later poets in a sequence,' there is no moral justification for Homer's Ate. It is not the result of man's own freedom to sin (that is atasthalie); it is always external. Agamemnon pleads that not he him- self was to blame for his share in the quarrel with Achilles, "but Zeus and Moira and Erinys, who cast angry Ate in his mind"; 6 and if it be urged that Agamemnon is merely seeking to excuse himself, let it be remembered that elsewhere Zeus is represented by the poet as wil- fully deceptive.' If Homer had been content to leave Ate a child of Physis (which she is), instead of making her a daughter of Zeus, much moral confusion might have been avoided. 1 I1. 20, 127 f.; 24, 209 f.; 24, 525; Od.

The double answer appears clearly in the words of Odysseus, over the dead bodies of the suitors: "These men hath the Moira of the gods overcome and their own cruel deeds. ... Wherefore they have met with an unseemly doom through their deeds of atasthalie." 1 Against any one-sided answer, and particularly against imputing every evil to the gods, Zeus himself protests in what may be called the locus classicus for this problem in Homer, in the council of the gods at the beginning of the Odyssey. "Lo, how vainly do mortals blame the gods! For from us do they say that evils come, whereas they them- selves through their deeds of atasthalie bring sorrows beyond what is ordained," 2 - that is, beyond the ills that are common to the condi- tion of mortals, provoking the vengeance of the gods for attempting to disturb the moral equilibrium, and in the case of Aegisthus, to which Zeus refers, despite the express warning of the gods. There is no pre- destination here; rather an opportunity offered and refused. Although the Homeric poems are above all else poems of heroic action, they contain incidentally a surprising amount of reflection on human life and destiny, sometimes in the form of brief gnomic utter- ances, traditional in character, and not especially appropriate to the speakers, sometimes developed into the rhesis. Such utterances, like that of Zeus, just mentioned, the accepted maxims and ideas of the epoch, were destined to be developed further by the elegiac poets; and they provide a running commentary on the action almost comparable to the lyric choruses of full-grown tragedy. Since the ideas of the Homeric world were far from systematic or even consistent with regard to the relation of Fate and the gods to Good and Evil, there were gnomai to several different effects which Homer's characters could cite as occasion arose. It would be hard to find in Homer an ascription to Zeus or to the gods of human happiness unmingled with suffering. What appears at first to be such an ascrip- tion proves to be a consolation for hardship - the remark of Nausicaa to shipwrecked Odysseus.3 That the gods bestow on men a diversity 1 Od. 22, 413-416. 2 l7rep 6poV, Od. I, 34. SOd. 6, 188-I90.</page><page sequence="10">I0 William Chase Greene of gifts is the theme of Odysseus himself, taunted by Euryalus for his unathletic appearance; and he develops the theme by antitheses, pass- ing back and forth from one side of the matter to the other, in a style that was to be characteristic of the elegy.' That the gods are all- powerful is another commonplace, from which is deduced moreover a reflection on the grudging nature of gods who do so much less for man than they might.2 Still more pointed is the reproach addressed to Zeus himself by Menelaus, exasperated by the Trojans, who, not content with having wantonly carried off his wife, are now insatiate of battle, apparently with the connivance of Zeus. "0 father Zeus, they say that thou dost excel in wisdom all others, both men and gods; and all these things are from thee. How wondrously art thou favoring men of violence (hybris), even the Trojans!" etc.3 Here is the germ of the reproach, now bitter, now brooding, that later poets were to take up.4 Other Homeric gnomai crowd upon the memory. "By the event is even a fool made wise" is a saying with which both Menelaus and Achilles conclude speeches.5 The feebleness of man,' man who is "even as the generations of leaves," 7 and the inevitability of death 8 (a thought which does not deter Hector from battle, and which actually heightens the resolution of Sarpedon) - these are familiar common- places. Rare is the deeper note of pessimism and the incipient philoso- phy of history that meets us in the words of Athene, who, in the guise of Mentor, stirs up Telemachus with the idea of the progressive de- generacy of mankind: if he be indeed his father's son, he will act; if not, there is no hope. "For few children, to be sure, are like their father; the most are worse, yet a few are better than their sire." 9 1 Od. 8, 166-185. Cf. J. T. Stickney, Les Sentences dans la Poesie grecque (Paris, 1903), Pp. 28-34; 94-96. 2 Od. 10, 306; cf. II. 13, 632; 16, 687-691; 19, go. II1. 13, 631-639.

Note the antithetical gnomic form of expression; it was not</page><page sequence="11">Fate, Good, and Evil, in Early Greek Poetry ii In two striking speeches put into the mouths of the two principal heroes of the respective poems, and throwing light on their characters, the philosophy of Fate, Good, and Evil is developed systematically and with an application to the special situation. In the last book of the Iliad, the "Ransoming of Hector," Priam and Achilles are brought together. Contrasted as strongly as possible, - Trojan with Greek, aged king with youthful warrior, weakness with fiery pride, - they are at last made equal by sorrow. To the moving appeal of Priam, Achilles in pity speaks his winged words: Ah hapless man, many evils hast thou endured in thy heart. . ... But come now, sit upon a seat, and we will let our sorrows lie in our hearts, grieved though we be, for nothing availeth chill lament. For thus did the gods spin the lot for wretched mortals, that they should live in pain; but they themselves are sorrowless. For upon the floor of Zeus stand two Jars (71rioL) of the evil gifts that he giveth, and another of blessings. To whom- soever Zeus, whose joy is in the lightning, giveth a mingled lot, he chanceth now on evil, now on good; but to whomsoever he giveth only of the evil, him he bringeth to outrage, and evil hunger driveth him over the goodly earth, and he is a wanderer honored neither of gods nor of men.' And Achilles continues with a personal application of this thesis, first to the case of his own father, and then to the lot of Priam. "Endure," he concludes, "and lament not overmuch in thy heart; for nought wilt thou avail by grieving for thy son, nor wilt thou bring him to life ere thou suffer some new evil." 2 What is the kernel of this hard- earned philosophy of Achilles? Acceptance of the good, resignation before the evil, that the gods bestow, and at last a pity born of fellow- suffering. In the course of his response to the kindly words of the half-decent suitor Amphinomus, Odysseus remarks: Nothing feebler than man doth the earth nurture, of all the creatures that breathe and move upon the face of the earth. Lo, he thinketh that never shall he suffer evil in time to come, while the gods give him prosperity, and his limbs move easily. But when the blessed gods bring to pass evil things, really to the point to mention an improvement of son over sire. The decline of suc- cessive generations will meet us again in Hesiod's Myth of the Ages of Men. See below, pp. 17-19. 1 II. 24, 518-533. 2 II. 24, 549-551.</page><page sequence="12">12 William Chase Greene these too he bears, though reluctantly, with steadfast heart. For the spirit of mortals is of the selfsame sort as the fortune ('yap) unto which the father of men and gods leadeth them. I, too, was once like to have been prosperous among men, but many a deed of atasthalie did I do, in hardihood and bold- ness of spirit, trusting in my father and my brethren. Wherefore let no man ever be lawless any more, but let him keep quietly the gifts of the gods, whatsoever they may give.1 And the unknown Odysseus continues with an application of this general principle to the presumption of the suitors, who will surely be punished when Odysseus returns, and prays, too late as it proves,2 that some daimon may withdraw Amphinomus from this encounter. Good and evil, it appears in this speech, are alike the gift of the gods; but man's own folly aggravates the evil or nullifies the good. Most striking is the mention of the "enduring spirit of man," commensurate with the fortunes that the gods bestow. This quality, whether it be a "grace" divinely vouchsafed or a moral good of human origin, is destined to play a great part in later Greek thought; good and evil, Odysseus suggests, are not merely objective "things" but are also attitudes of the mind. But neither Homer nor any other Greek will go so far as to say that "there is nothing either good or bad, but think- ing makes it so"; evil is evil, but may be minimized by a manly en- durance that rises to the occasion, and this is a good. And in the counsel to "keep quietly the gifts of the gods" Odysseus characteris- tically supplies the other half of his philosophy, the prudent acceptance of good in such a way as not to tempt Providence. The philosophy of the quiet life begins thus early, and comes well from one who has experienced the strenuous life.3 Homer's world is complete. If it preserves stubborn inconsistencies, of Nature and Law, of Fate and Free Will, of the things that are and the things that should be, of pessimism and courage, they are incon- sistencies naively or frankly accepted, as eternal mysteries. If Homer looks back on ancient wars in heaven and the emergence of a new order, the wars are long past and the results accepted; certainly he entertains no hopes of a better order to come, and little fear of a worse. 1 Od.

The sense of movement is all-important. The Theogony seeks to explain how the existing order of divinities came to be; the Works and Days, finding toil and injustice in the world, seeks to account for their genesis, and then to show how to make the best of a weary world. We may well accept the Theogony not as by Hesiod but as Hesiodic, in the sense that it continues the Boeotian didactic tradition and is to be dated not long after Hesiod; 1 much of the matter is earlier, borrowing from ancient religious poetry, hymns and myths, Homeric or even pre-Homeric. In its attempt to classify the divine powers and define their relationships, it proceeds on two main principles. One is the idea of generation, or Physis, the struggle of the powers of Nature and the birth of successive daimones. Here there is little suggestion of good or evil; the poet is content to narrate. The other idea is that of progress, from anarchy and violence to order, with a climax in the triumph of Zeus over the Titans and the establishment of his reign.2 And here, it is to be noted, it is definitely good that has triumphed over evil. Not that the poet is wholly consistent either with Homeric tradition or with himself. We note in particular the double pedigree of Moira: first the Moirai are described as daughters of Night, along with Moros, the Keres, and Nemesis and other powers; 3 they are birth- goddesses, "Klotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, who give men at their birth both evil and good to have," though they also punish the transgres- sions of men and of gods.4 Later, in the new r6gime, the Moirai appear, along with the Horai and Eunomia and Dike and Eirene, as the hon- ored daughters of Zeus and Themis, dispensing evil and good.5 But they have nothing to do with the philosophy of history of the Theogony, such as it is.6 The truth of the matter is that the poet is but slightly concerned with justice and human good and evil. Even the myth of Prometheus, as he tells it, is partly aetiological,7 and partly told to 1 For a brief defence of Hesiodic authorship of the Theogony cf. P.

' The poet is a priest. Hesiod, on the other hand, the author of the Works and Days, is a prophet.2 He, too, knows his Homer, and the Boeotian traditional didactic poetry, and the oracles that are coming from Delphi on the further side of Parnassus,3 as well as the proverbial sayings and fables that one might hear in winter at the crowded lesche of the smithy.4 But he is smarting under the sense of social and personal injustices, and his whole poem is, among other things, a protest against hybris and a plea for dike. He wishes to believe that the just flourish,5 and that the gods punish injustice;6 indeed he contrasts Nature, "red of tooth and claw," with man, whose distinguishing mark is justice.7 But it is hard to believe; so often, in his Iron Age, do the facts belie his faith. "The earth is full of evils and the sea is full." 8 Disease stalks silently abroad; 9 Zeus himself, for all his power and justice,1' oft punishes a whole city for the sin of one evil man." And the alter- native to injustice is, for most men, back-breaking toil. How can Hesiod reconcile all this ? To be honest, he cannot reconcile it wholly. He can repeat tradi- tional sentiments, but despite his attempts at a systematic "didac- tic and admonitory epistle" 12 his gift is not consistency, skill in 1 Id. 613. 2 Cf. T. A.

These are the first gnomic expressions in Greek literature of the theory of vicarious atonement by one person or by a people for the wickedness of another, and are given as proof of the justice and power of Zeus, which are not questioned by Hesiod. Narratives illustrating such vicarious atonement are, of course, abundant; cf. II. I, 9-12; Hes. Op. 47-49. Probably the notion, as found in Homer and Hesiod, is rooted in the primitive feeling that the prosperity of a people depends on the magical powers of their king or (later) on his righteousness; cf. Od. 19, 109-114, and Nilsson, Homer and Mycenae, p. 220. For the punishment of the innocent children of the guilty, cf.

But he does stubbornly attempt to explain the genesis of evil and toil, in two famous myths; and he attempts also to suggest to Perses what can be done to make a virtue of necessity by finding a good in toil. We are not likely to understand Hesiod's use of the story of Prome- theus 2 unless we constantly remember that it is introduced wholly in order to account for the origin of toil, and that toil is, in the myth, regarded as wholly evil. Toil was not always necessary; 3 it is part of the penalty inflicted by Zeus in his anger at the original deception of Prometheus in the matter of the sacrifice.4 After Zeus had hidden men's means of livelihood 5 and fire,6 and Prometheus had retaliated by stealing fire back again,7 Zeus in reprisal8 sent Pandora, from whose pithos issued all the evils of men.9 The unnamed woman in the myth of the Theogony is represented by the misogynist author, somewhat in the vein of Semonides of Amorgus, as herself evil and as the source of evil; 10 Pandora in the Works and Days is the innocent but baleful 1 Cf. Stickney, Sentences, pp. 58; 65. 2 Clearly a traditional story; from it Hesiod appropriates in an allusive style only what he needs for his purpose, as does the author of the Theogony. Hesiod, for example, but not the Theogony, omits the story of the final punishment of Pro- metheus. Originally the myth doubtless grew out of the hostility of the Titan Prometheus to the Olympians, and his attempt to upset the equilibrium (moira) of Zeus. With this is combined the conflict between the native Prometheus, a culture-hero, and his rival the oriental, but naturalized, Hephaestus. Cf. L. Malten, P. W., s. v. Hephaistos. 3 Hes.

Why does Hope remain in the pithos? Because it is a good, or because it is an evil? Because it is available to man, or because it is denied to man? I agree with T. A. Sinclair I that it is not to the purpose to collect passages from Greek literature proving that Hope is sometimes a good, sometimes an evil; but I do not accept his contention that Hope is imprisoned because she is denied to man, whose condition is "hopeless." Better is the suggestion of S. M. Adams 2 that Hesiod "is drawing a distinction between those evils for which man is at least partially responsible and those others which assail him for no ascertainable cause." The vindictiveness of Zeus, and the plight of mankind, at all points worse off than before, are the two essential elements in this myth of degeneration, which ends, as does the myth of the Theogony, with the moral that there is no way to escape from the will of Zeus.3 Here is indeed matter for tragedy, if not for irony, in the spectacle of the good intentions of Prometheus frustrated. Or is it rather satire on the sup- posed blessings of civilization, the attempt of techne to supplant physis?4 Or are we, with W. Headlam,5 to see in Prometheus, not the benefactor of man, the culture-hero, but the serpent who caused man to leave the Garden of Eden? The suggestion is tempting; but it is only from the point of view of Zeus that Prometheus is evil; and the Zeus of Hesiod's myth is himself anything but kindly. We must read neither Aeschylus nor Shelley into Hesiod.6 Nor should we identify the toil of the myth, which is an evil, with the noble kind of strife mentioned early in the Works and Days.' The two are cleverly fused, to be sure, by Virgil,8 and developed in the gospel of toil, which is 1 Sinclair, Hesiod, p. I3. 2 "Hesiod's Pandora," C. R. XLVI (1932), pp. 193-196.

Virgilian labor, however, is not Hesiodic 7r6pos.1 Degeneration and the inevitability of toil are the themes also of the Myth of the Ages, which immediately follows. Instead of the dynastic sequence of the Theogony, moving from chaos to order, it presents a dissolving view of steady physical and moral decline. The Golden Age, the "dream of a tired peasant," as M. Croiset well called it,2 the age of primitive innocence, of the "good old days," is painted with a 1 See below, pp. 18 f. 2 Hist. de la Litt. grecque3 (Paris, 1910), I, p. 506. Cf. J. R. Lowell, Literary Es- says, II (Boston, 1892), p. 98: "From the days of the first grandfather, everybody has remembered a golden age behind him. No doubt Adam depreciated the apple which the little Cain on his knee was crunching, by comparison with those he him- self had tasted in Eden." By this reasoning, the first grandfather, or perhaps Adam himself, was the first laudator temporis acti. There are surprisingly few traces of such an attitude in Homer; it begins in earnest in Hesiod. On the Ages generally and especially on the Golden Age and on the later tradition of the idea, among mystics, philosophers, and poets, Greek and Roman, see further: H. T. Buckle, Hist. of Civilization in England, I (New York, 1858), p. 96 (on the idea of the Golden Age as a phase of an irrational and erroneous "indulgence of a poetic sentiment in favour of the remote and unknown"); E.

(For several of these references I am indebted to the kindness of Professor A. S. Pease.) Of the ideas found in later elaborations of the Golden Age, several, though not all, are implicit in Hesiod: the rule of Kronos (Saturn), not of Zeus (Jupiter); blessings that come of their own accord, without toil; piety; communism; vegetarianism; the simple life, according to nature, without the arts and sciences, and without navigation, trade, or war. That man's fall came through his restless invention of these dangerous devices, is a later notion. With the contrary idea of the progress of man (cf. Aesch. P. V. 440- 455; Lucret. 5, 925-1457), and with the idea that the Golden Age may return</page><page sequence="18">18 William Chase Greene nostalgic longing. Kronos, not the brutal Titan of the Theogony, but the kindly earth-daimon of the lingering ritual of the Kronia, gives place to Zeus, one infers, at the end of the Golden Age; kindly physis and the sweet disorder of the 'pxaos flos 1 to the nomos and tolerated hybris of later ages; union with the gods 2 to enmity and the appear- ance of intermediate daimones; ease and abundance to toil; good to evil. In his masterly analysis of the sequence of the ages, E. Meyer 3 calls attention to the inevitable moral decline that accompanies the natural degeneration from gold to silver (a pair of fantasy pictures), and from bronze to iron (pictures based on some understanding of history).4 The idleness of the Golden Age leads to the enervation and the presumption of the Silver Age; the physical violence of the bronze men leads to the impiety and intellectual craftiness of the iron men. A tribute to Homer may be read in the Age of Heroes that interrupts the scheme; their violence is tempered by their justice.5 And this momentary halt in the hitherto steady degeneration of the ages may suggest that Hesiod sees a ray of hope for better days to follow him.6 The Myth of the Ages is more than a philosophy of history; it has its moral for Perses. Even a Utopia of idleness cannot last, but leads to degeneration; nor can the resort to intellect, a stronger tool than brute force, survive if it leads to mere craftiness and injustice. The moral is, then, that Perses had better not trust to Utopian dreams of wealth easily to be won, or to injustice; he had better be upright, and work.7 The point is helped by the apparent freedom of will granted (cf. Plato, Polit. 269c; Virg. Buc. 4) we are not here concerned; Hesiod's interest is in explaining how evil entered the world. 1 Cf. Od. 9, 106-115. 2 Hes.

To be sure, the stage is set and the story manipulated more mechanically than in Plato's account of the progressive decline of society in the Republic;' and each race lives up to the quality bestowed by its creator, and is "in character." Yet the illusion exists that each race could act otherwise if it willed so to do; certainly to each race except the men of gold and the heroes blame is attached for its conduct, and the men of silver and of iron definitely incur the anger of their creator,2 whereas the men of gold and the heroes earn a kind of blessed immortality.3 Perses had better be warned betimes. As in the Myth of Prometheus, so in the Myth of the Ages the anger of Zeus has brought on man the necessity of toil. But a virtue may be made of this necessity; a peasant may attain to a philosophy of hardship and manly endurance as noble in its way as that of Achilles or Odysseus. If "the gods have placed between us and goodness the sweat of our brows," * and a long, steep way, the way becomes easier through resolution.5 This is the noble kind of Eris, appointed by Zeus, which is good for men.6 Note that Hesiod does not say that Zeus appointed it for man's good; it is man's discovery, despite the niggardliness of the gods, that toil brings courage, intelligence, and satisfaction, as well as wealth to offset what Zeus concealed from man.' What is more, men who deal justly with their fellows find that something like the Golden Age returns among men, and "with merry- making they tend the fields which are all their care." 8 The leaven of Homer and of Hesiod was at work in the seventh and sixth centuries, in which elegiac and iambic verse made familiar to 1 Books VIII and IX. 2 Hes.

Whatever view be taken of the origin and use of the elegy during the earlier part of its career, it is clear at least that it is accretional, full of phrases and commonplaces echoed from epic and from earlier elegy, sometimes twisted into new uses; that it is full of antitheses, and lacking in con- sistency and systematic structure; and that it tends ordinarily to pre- serve a gnomic character, addressing itself to a definite listener or reader, or, in a special social setting, to a group.1 Homeric diction 2 and Homeric ideas naturally color the elegies of Callinus and Tyrtaeus, and even of Mimnermus. That death, the polpa OavdrTov, is inevitable, but that if it be met in a manly fashion it is glorious, is a recurrent theme in the more martial poets.3 In Mim- nermus, of course, it is the negative aspect that prevails: man's life like the leaves, the woes that Zeus bestows, the hatefulness of old age.4 In his passionate conviction that after youth has passed life is not worth living, Mimnermus almost anticipates the even more over- whelmingly pessimistic commonplace, first phrased by Theognis, that it were best never to have been born;5 yet Mimnermus clutches at the fleeting joys of youth, less wise than Epicurus and Horace, or even than Archilochus. The pessimism of Semonides of Amorgus extends beyond his mi- sogyny to a vast distrust of Zeus and all his works. In a poem pre- served by Stobaeus in the long section entitled "That life is short, of little account, and full of cares," Semonides ascribes to Zeus om- nipotence, to man a stupid gullibility, and proceeds to show how all man's hopes are cheated by age or by death: " So true is it that nothing is without ills; nay ten thousand are the dooms of men and their woes and sorrows past reckoning." 6 I Stickney, Sentences, pp. 79-102; R.

But Archilochus, be it noted, does not stress, as do Solon and even Theognis, the worth of virtue and piety in attaining to peace of mind.

Though it is impossible to arrange with certainty all the fragments, we shall not do violence to the probable development of his thought if we suppose that the longest poem, the "Prayer to the Muses," 1 comes fairly early in his life, before his political activity, and expresses the inherited and tested creed of an Athenian gentleman who has engaged in trade.2 Throughout the first part of the poem (11. 1-32), the emphasis is on justice, the security of wealth justly won with the approval of the gods, and the retribution that attends injustice 3 - if not immediately, at any rate in the end, perhaps striking the innocent children of those guilty persons who have themselves escaped the 8ew^v yo^pa. (Solon accepts this doctrine with- out criticism, and without any suggestion of Orphic beliefs of punish- ment in another world.) So far Solon's attitude is one of conservative piety; the gods are just, ate follows hybris, and meets with retribution (TiLLS); Zeus oversees all, and his vengeance is as sure, though per- haps not as swift, as the clearing away of the clouds in spring by the wind. That is, moral law is as certain as Physis. Both a deep-seated moral conviction of the power of justice and observation of the world of affairs impel Solon to dread ill-gotten gains and to proclaim that justice is the best policy. Observation, however, has taught Solon also something about the vicissitudes of life. The second part of the poem (11. 33-76) therefore emphasizes the uncertainty of man's lot and his various undertakings and the deceptiveness of his hopes; both good and evil come from Moira,4 and the gifts of the gods may not be refused; 5 so inscrutable is their will that they often afflict with great and sore ate him who strives to act nobly,6 and to another who is acting ill God gives good fortune and a release from his folly.'

Yet if we are right in sup- posing that Solon, for all his conventional reference to Moira, believed that men have a full measure of responsibility for their careers, and if moreover we may agree with F. Wehrli 2 in taking abrwVT 0 (1. 75) as referring to the men themselves, as the source of ate, rather than to the KEp3Ea (1. 74) bestowed by the gods, we shall conclude with Solon that though wealth is the root of all evil, it is not wealth alone but the greed that it so often engenders that works ruin. And Solon ends the poem, as he all but begins it, on the note of retribution.3 Unex- plained, and perhaps unexplainable, is the affliction with ate of even him who is striving to do nobly; * here is the stubborn residuum of evil that every philosophy finds it difficult to justify on purely moral grounds. Solon accepts it in the spirit of faith, and returns to his convictions. Not absolute consistency, then, but a faith maintained in spite of misgivings,5 is the achievement of this poem. Nor is it perfectly con- structed as a work of art, despite the attempts of H. Weil and others to discover in it a strophic structure; 6 it is still "paragraph poetry," loosely composed of elegiac couplets, and breaking into two main parts. Nevertheless it traces with something like a system for the first 1 Sem. Amorg. i; cf. 29. See above, p. 20. 2 Wehrli, AAOE BIU2MA2M, p. 12, n. i. K. Reinhardt, R. M. LXXI (1916), p. 132, though not quite explicit, seems to take the words in the same sense. Linforth, Solon, pp. 241 f., rejects a similar suggestion by Kynaston, and consequently has to hold (p. iio) that "this time [i.e., at the end of the poem] there is no distinction between honest and dishonest riches." Wilamowitz, Sappho und Simonides (Berlin, 1913), pp. 263; 267, also retains the older interpretation. Cf. Od. I, 32; W. Jaeger, Sitzber. preuss. Akad. Wiss.

This is of the essence of tragedy, though it provides no theory of the nature of the tragic aiaprTa. 6 Linforth, Solon, p. iii, calls it "the normal attitude of pious perplexity."

This generalized creed Solon proceeds in another poem 1 to apply to the grievous plight of Athens, afflicted not by "the aisa of Zeus or the will of the blessed immortal gods," but by the folly and greed of her own people, whose hybris leads to injustice; they give no heed to justice, who, though now silent, will in time demand retribution. The moral which Solon proclaims is the need of eunomia, the practical ex- pression of justice, to check koros and make hybris dim and wither budding ate.2 Here is an explanation of human good and evil in purely human terms, albeit under the rule of friendly and powerful gods. The pedigree of hybris is vaguely suggested once more. Possibly it is only a little later, and still before his political reforms, that Solon, an aristocrat whose career and personal fortune have made of him a member of the middle class, as Aristotle remarks, "urges the rich not to be greedy." 3 "Calm the eager tumult of your hearts. Ye have forced your way to a surfeit (Kbpos) of good things; confine your swelling thoughts within moderate bounds," etc.' Almost certainly it is after the archonship that he phrases, in an appeal to the demos to find a mean between excessive freedom and excessive restraint, the classic statement of the pedigree of hybris, though without tracing its consequences: "For koros giveth birth to hybris, when great pros- perity (6kXos) followeth after men whose minds are not sound." 5 Once more the emphasis is on human responsibility and sanity of mind, not on fatalism or jealous gods. And still later, after the tyranny of the Peisistratids is established, Solon writes: "If ye have suffered the dire consequences of your own fault, blame not the gods for this evil fortune; ye have yourselves exalted these men," etc.6 1 Solon, 3. 2 Cf. further Jaeger, op. cit., pp. 69-85. 3 Arist.

Such pessimism, one may suppose, came late in Solon's life, as the fruit of disappointment. He stops short, however, of declaring that it were better never to have been born.2 And it is tempting to suppose further that it was largely from this couplet, and any others like it that he may have written, that Herodotus or his informant manu- factured the famous story of the interview between Solon and Croesus, and Solon's reluctance to count a man happy before his death has ended a perfect life.3 But Solon's retort to Mimnermus, setting four- score years as the goal of a good life, argues no bitterness of spirit.4 The work that has come down to us under the name of Theognis represents the ideas that prevailed in the late sixth century. Accept- ing as authentic at least the first book, which is all that happens to concern our problem, and even the passages borrowed from Tyrtaeus, Mimnermus, and Solon as deliberately borrowed and exploited for a purpose,5 we have as in the Works and Days a body of verse, mainly didactic, and addressed mainly to an individual, though it lends itself also to sympotic and to educational uses.

The whole matter of appropriation in Theognis should be studied further in the light of the methods of Greek poetry generally; Clem. Al.

It is for the most part still "paragraph poetry," still antithetical in style, a composite of traditional nuggets, loosely connected, and sug- gesting a collection, a sort of Greek satura; it invites comparison with the Hebrew Book of Proverbs, with Poor Richard's Almanack, and with Martin Farquhar Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy: A Book of Thoughts and Arguments Originally Treated. The poet expressly tells Cyrnus: "I shall give thee the counsels that I learned from good men when I was a lad;" I yet he, like Solon, reckons with the political stress of his age, ever fearing the fruits of hybris and stasis.2 Both poets stress human responsibility for human evils; the difference is in the narrower political sympathies of the later poet and his deeper pessimism. The order of the parts is not of great significance, especially after the first 254 lines; no injustice will be done to the thought of Theognis if we make a cento of the passages that bear upon our problem. So abundant is the material that we must be content for the most part to select one or two passages to illustrate each theme, giving mere references to other passages of similar import. Of especial prominence is the old thought that "man proposes, but God disposes." No man is himself the cause of loss (6il77) and gain (KEpaos), Cyrnus; the gods are the givers of them both; nor doth any that laboreth know in his heart whether he moveth to a good end or to a bad. For often when he thinketh he shall do evil he doeth good, and doeth evil when he thinketh he shall do good. Nor doth any man get what he wisheth; for the barriers of sore perplexity hold him back. We men consider vain things, knowing naught, while the gods accomplish all according to their own mind.3 The gods are not only omnipotent but inscrutable.

"Possessions doth Heaven (bai4wv) give even to the wicked, Cyrnus, but the boon (po-pa) of virtue cometh to but few." 4 For all that, Theognis does not envy the prosperity of the useless and the wicked; it is valor and virtue that endure.5 Never- theless he gives voice in a famous passage to a protest, upbraiding omnipotent Zeus for bestowing the same moira on hybris and on so- phrosyne; the wicked enjoy olbos, the just receive penia, mother of per- plexity (ap.xavir), which corrupts their wits by strong necessity (ava-yKq) into evil-doing (a4wrXaKti).6 This is indeed a courageous pro- test, tracing incidentally the moral decline of man in a new termi- nology,7 and throwing the blame on Zeus in a tone of apparently 1 Theog. 1075-1078; cf. 381 f.; also 903-930 (if authentic). 2 Theog. 197-208; cf.

A. Croiset well remarks: "Here is the great enigma of moral theology boldly posed; this is a memorable date in the history of Greek thought."' Shall we call this the protest of a troubled but orthodox thinker, or the disillusion- ment of a renegade? Shall we find in the passage that immediately follows,2 on the uses of adversity, and in another passage 3 bidding mortals not to sit in judgment on immortals, signs of a recovery of orthodoxy? Or shall we find in the parallel protest tokens of a settled attitude of pessimism and cynicism? Father Zeus [he cries], I would it were the gods' pleasure that hybris should delight the wicked if they so choose, but that whosoever did abomi- nable acts intentionally, with no regard for the gods, should pay the penalty himself, and the deeds of atasthalie of the father should not become a mis- fortune to his children after him. . . . But as it is, the doer escapeth, and another beareth the misfortune afterwards. Yet how can it be just, O king of the immortals, that a man who hath no part in unjust deeds, committing no transgression nor perjury, but being just, should not fare justly? 1 A. Croiset, Hist. de la Litt. grecque3, II (Paris, 1914), P. 156. Cf. Jeremiah, I2, i: "Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?" This is the first time in Hebrew literature (early sixth cent.) that the problem of the prosperity of the unrighteous is raised, probably after Jeremiah has narrowly escaped from a plot against his life. The answer of Yahweh is simply that Jeremiah has worse sufferings still to face. Inconsistent are the two strains in Job, the prose (early, orthodox) and the poetry (later, heterodox), being hardly reconciled; but the outcome is (i) resignation (19, 25; 40, 3-5; 42, 1-6), as in Theognis, and (2) recourse from the contempla- tion of God's dealings with man to God's majestic ways in Nature (36, 24-41, 34), a magnificent if unethical retreat from Dike to Physis. J. M. Edmonds, Elegy and Iambus (Loeb ed.), I, p. 13, n. 2, regards Theognis 373-392 as late, remarking that both it and 731-752 (see below, p. 30) "take Zeus to task (contrast 687) in the manner of late-fifth-century Athens." But we have already met the germ of the protest in Homer (see above, p. io). The metrical arguments which Edmonds chiefly stresses (based on the frequency of the masculine caesura in the 3rd foot of the hexameter) seems to me inconclusive for the two passages in question (i such caesura in 1.66 and in 1.83 lines, respectively; even in Tyrtaeus, however, I find such variations as I in 5.3 lines (T. 6; 7), I in 1.7 (T. 8), and I in 1.2 (T. 9)). 2 Theog. 393-398. Theog. 687-688.</page><page sequence="30">30 William Chase Greene And the poet goes on to ask how, in view of this situation, men could stand in awe of gods who permit such moral confusion.' Like all his contemporaries, he believes that the gods punish the innocent chil- dren of the wicked; 2 but apparently he is the first who believes this to be bad, a blot on a dispensation that pretends to be just. As a matter of fact, we know that the innocent often suffer through the fault of the guilty or the careless; that is perhaps a matter of physis, rather than of dike or of special interference by the gods. For the primitive Greek, who thought of guilt as something tangible, all but physical, it was logical enough for guilt to be inherited, like diseases or debts. For Herodotus, the punishment of the guilty is merely just (Q3KaLov), and that of their sons something divine (0ELTaTop... ovro wrp~yC), that is, a sign of the active nemesis of the gods.4 It is the more remarkable that Theognis, beginning to realize that morality must be defined in terms of the will, should have made his protest in terms even faintly suggestive of a Hebrew prophet.5 For the rest, it is not surprising that Theognis, looking at the ex- ternals of life, should have voiced at times a thoroughgoing pessimism. With Mimnermus 6 and Alcaeus 7 and Horace 1 and Omar, he shares the darker side of the Epicurean creed. "I play rejoicing in youth; for long is the time that I shall lie underground without life, like a speechless stone, and leave the lovely light of the sun; and good though I be, I shall see nothing more." 9 Or again, "one man hath this ill, another that, and not one of all that the sun beholdeth is happy in very truth."10 A darker vein of brooding runs through one 1 Theog. 731-752.

I Here is once more the stuff of tragedy. But seldom does Greek tragedy plumb the very abyss of pessimism that meets us, and for the first time, in Theognis, and that was to become the familiar commonplace 7I Viza'. "Best of all for mortals were it never to have been born, nor to have seen the rays of the burning sun; but if once born, to pass as soon as may be the gates of Hades, and to lie under a goodly heap of earth." 2 This is the "De Profundis" of Theognis, and he rarely sinks to such despairing utterance. Granted that this world is largely evil, and that the gods give little help, he knows, like Homer and Hesiod, like Archi- lochus and Solon, how to face hardship with wisdom and resolution, and even piety. "Choose rather to dwell with little wealth in piety than to be rich with possessions unjustly gained; justice is the whole sum of virtue, and every man is good, Cyrnus, if he be just." 3 E. Har- rison 4 and J. T. Stickney 5 find irony in the position of another quat- rain,6 a commendation of justice, immediately following the protest 1 Theog. 401-406. Cf. E. G.

Rather is he orthodox in setting forth the pedigree of hybris and its fruits. "To an evil man whose place he is about to remove, Cyrnus, God first giveth hybris."' Note that it is not a malicious god who acts, and that it is an evil man who is afflicted with hybris.2 This point explains well enough the turn that Theognis gives to Solon's couplet on the pedigree of hybris I by substituting KaK0 for roXs; the thought is substantially the same in both poets, but in borrowing from Solon the later poet gives every possible emphasis to the character of the mortal, "to lay stress on the fact that it is not the quantity of the good fortune [troX' s 6Xo, Solon] but the quality of the recipient's mind [KaKw ... azvOporcp, Theognis] which determines his fate." 4 Finally, in adapting to his purpose the last six lines of Solon's "Prayer to the Muses," the lines dealing with the insatiate greed bred of wealth, and its dire results, Theognis makes, together with insignificant changes, a major substitution: 5 whereas Solon writes, "the immortals give mortals possessions, yet ruin (ar&amp;T) stands revealed coming from them" (i.e. from mortals), Theognis substitutes "the possessions of mortals turn to folly (dApo- ryl?7) and ruin (Ar57) stands revealed coming from it." Hudson-Wil- liams,6 writing on the substitution in this passage (which he does not 1 Theog. i51 f. 2 J.

Theognis is trying to vindicate the ways of God and assert a measure of human responsibility. But of course he does not achieve complete consistency, as Adam also remarks on the same page. 3 Theog. 153 f.; Solon, 5, 9 f.; see above, p. 25. 4 Harrison, Studies in Theog. p. I13. Hudson-Williams, Elegies of Theog. pp. 48 f., is scornful of such a theory of appropriation by Theognis; yet he writes (255) that "a change in the sense was introduced in order to emphasize the effects of K6poS upon the bad man," and cites Clement of Alexandria (Str. 6, p. 740), who "knew that the popular version was ascribed to Theognis, and he may have read it himself in a MS. of the Megarian poet." That is indeed the very least to be made of Cle- ment's explicit statement: 160covos b6 iroLjo-avros '71KrTE y&amp;p K6pos flpew, 6ray iroXAs 6X4os 4E7rfatL,' VTLKUpV 6 o0 Of LM YP 4'E4 'TIKTfEL roL KOPOS iLSpLV, OTayV KacKy floS ra'tr.' 5 Theog. 227-232; Solon, i, 71-76; see above, pp. 23 f. 6 Hudson-Williams, Elegies of Theog. p. 191.</page><page sequence="33">Fate, Good, and Evil, in Early Greek Poetry 33 attribute to Theognis himself), remarks that Solon's line "was re- placed by 230 to avoid holding the gods responsible." According to the interpretation of Solon's lines accepted above,' Solon also avoids holding the gods responsible; but the substituted lines are still more explicit in holding man and his folly accountable.2 What is the practical result of the philosophy of Theognis? First, a faith in prudential maxims of conduct, especially with regard to moderation, as in drinking, a mean between two extremes.3 "Be not too eager in any matter; the mean is the best in all things; and thus, Cyrnus, thou shalt have virtue, which is a thing hard to get." 4 He believes, moreover, in the power of the human mind. "Judgment (-yvc~',), Cyrnus, is the best thing the gods give mortals; judgment holdeth the end of all things. O happy he that hath it in his mind! He is far stronger than baleful hybris and dolorous koros, and these are of those evils than which there is none worse for mortals; for every evil, Cyrnus, cometh from them." 5 It follows that man is largely re- sponsible for his condition. "All things here are among the crows and perdition, nor is any of the blessed immortal gods, Cyrnus, to blame; rather the violence of men and their base gains and their hybris have cast us from much good into evil." 6 This is doubtless spoken with pious intent, to divert blame for evil from gods to men; 7 but it is palpably at variance with the idea that man proposes and God dis- poses.8 Elsewhere, also in the interest of piety, Theognis adapts the passage of Solon's "Prayer to the Muses" on the uncertainty of the 1 See above, p. 24. 2 apooavq I suppose to have been suggested by Solon, i, 70, on the "folly" from which God may deliver man.

Whereas Solon says that one who is seeking to "do well" (E6 Epbecw) falls unexpectedly into ate, and one who is "doing ill" (KaKC7S Ep&amp;ovrc) is delivered by God into good fortune, Theognis makes the contrast between one who is merely seeking a fair reputation (EOKL- uEwv) and fails, and one who is really acting well (KaXwaks 7ote-ovrL) and is prospered by God, even his blunders coming to a good end.2 This violent perversion of Solon's thought is certainly made "to 'justify the ways of God to man."' 3 Between the divine dispensation and the activity of man, then, Theognis holds that much good may emerge. "Never swear that a thing cannot be, for the gods resent it, and the end is theirs. Yet do something; good may come of bad, and bad of good," etc.* Here is at least a sporting chance in an uncertain world. And at the very worst, Theognis, like Archilochus, counsels endurance and manliness. "We ought to endure (roXtaiv) what the gods give mortal men and bear patiently either lot." 5 "Neither make thy heart too sick with evils nor too quickly glad of good, ere thou see the final end."6 "Bear up (r6VMa), Cyrnus, in ill fortune, because once thou didst rejoice in good, when Moira enjoined that thou shouldst share in that," [and pray, rather than display thy misery].7 And Theognis takes his own medi- cine: "It is not possible, Cyrnus, to avoid what it is our lot (moira) to suffer; and what it is my lot to suffer, I fear not to suffer." 8 Ho- meric in some of its diction, and indebted to Archilochus for the form of self-address,9 but full of a noble resignation and a noble resolution that come from Theognis himself, is an address to his own soul. Endure (rbXpa), my soul, in misfortune, though thou hast suffered the in- tolerable; 'tis sure the heart of the baser sort is quicker to wrath. Be not thou in great distress or anger over deeds that cannot be done, nor grieve 1 Theog. 585-590; Solon, I, 65-70; see above, pp. 23 f. 2 Harrison, Studies in Theog. p.

Not easily shall mortal man escape the destined gifts of the gods, neither if he sink to the bottom of the purple sea, nor when he be held in murky Tartaros.1 Perhaps the conclusion of the whole matter, for Theognis, is ex- pressed in his emphasis on human character as something that can rise superior to circumstances. "Nobody is all-happy in all things; but the good man, if he have evil, yet endureth, though men know it not, whereas the bad man knoweth not how to abide and restrain his heart either in weal or in evil. Of all sorts are the gifts that come of the immortals to mortals; yet endure we must to keep the gifts they send, of whatsoever sort they be." 2 Surely this attitude, which the tragic poets were soon to rediscover among the uses of adversity, is a positive and a precious moral gain; all may be lost, save honor and rX,ooi'vn. And it is a step toward the philosophy of happiness of Plato and Aristotle. The centuries that preceded the rise of Greek tragedy and of Greek philosophy were thus incessantly preoccupied with the problem of Fate, Good, and Evil. However much the problem was to grow later out of the form of tragedy itself and the great myths of tragedy, how- ever stubbornly the philosophers were to attempt an intellectual solu- tion, however much the Orphic religion was to transform Greek ideas of the soul and moral values, the Greeks had already built a solid structure of thought about the problem. Though not wholly consist- ent, it is a single tradition from Homer to Theognis and beyond, drawing from heroic action, peasant and civic life, and personal vi- cissitudes its touch of reality, and pouring its thought into gnomic form, often in antithetical half-truths. Its trend is from Physis to Nomos; it comes to distrust Nature and the gifts of the gods, and to find whatever of good the world affords more in social justice and the wise and brave acceptance and use of what Fate brings. Each of the major poets, as we have seen, makes his contribution to the development of this tradition. For Homer, seeking to reconcile natural phenomena with anthropomorphic divinities, Moira and the 1 Theog. 1029-1036. Cf.

Despite his distinction between Ate and atasthalie, Homer permits Menelaus to reproach Zeus for con- niving with the wicked Trojans. Yet Zeus himself disclaims respon- sibility for what men suffer Vrip pEbpov, and Achilles and Odysseus lay the foundations of a philosophy of endurance. In the myths of Hesiod, the source of evil is involved in a theory of cosmic degeneration, and human good is founded on the acceptance of the inevitable and on prudence and industry. The gnomic poets seek, though with mis- givings, to maintain their orthodoxy. Archilochus, bewildered by the vicissitudes of life, introduces the idea of -r7Vx; but he develops the philosophy of rX?7yo-rym, initiating moreover the literary device of self-address in the expression of it. Solon's emphasis is on the moral responsibility of man; and he is the first to trace systematically the sequence of moral decline. He is troubled by the spectacle of the suf- fering of good men, along with the wicked, for both good and evil come from Moira, and the gifts of the gods may not be refused; he is not troubled by the punishment of the innocent children of the wicked. Theognis, however, protests against such a miscarriage of justice, as he protests against the prosperity of the wicked; and he launches the pessimistic commonplace yi) k0iat. Nevertheless he qualifies his pes- simism with counsels of piety and moderation and prudence. And if he is inconsistent, like his predecessors, in attributing evil now to the gift of the gods, now to the hybris of men, like them he also proclaims the need of activity and endurance.</page></plain_text>
