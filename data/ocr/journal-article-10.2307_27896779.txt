<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 INTRODUCTION The major story of 2008-2009 was undoubtedly the opening of the New Acropolis Museum, which occupied the headlines on many occasions before the final opening ceremony on 20th June. As the culmination of the programme of major museum, site and archive projects reported in 2007-2008, the Acropolis Museum is the most spectacular example of a fundamental and far-reaching change in the range and quality of information now accessible to visitors to Greece, and in the research facilities available to scholars. And it is certainly not the only contribu tion of such magnitude over the past year. We will return to museums presently, and note among the many sites newly landscaped and presented to the public, anc. Kos, Karthaia on Kea, Phylakopi on Melos and Petres in the prefecture of Fiorina. The academic impact of many of these restoration and/or conservation projects has been considerable: the new reconstruction of the palace of Philip II at Vergina, achieved after a mere 2 years of intensive study, is perhaps the most striking case. For researchers, the inauguration in December 2008 of the historical archives of the Archaeological Service (the national archive of monuments) in restored neoclassical premises in Thissio promises a significant resource for more contemporary cultural-historical studies: this archive will be available online at http://nam.culture.gr. The archaeological story in 2008-2009 is more mixed - perhaps inevitably so in the present economic climate. There is no doubting the variety and significance of the discoveries which we have to report. In terms of period, our understanding of the EBA is greatly enriched by the detailed documentation of the largest settlement in the Cyclades, on Dhaskalio, where important evidence for early bronzeworking complements the hoard of tools found in the sea off Glyfada Mesi in Thrace. Spectacular individual finds include the public archive of the city of Pella from the L4th-lst Ct BC, the Vergina gold wreath, the remains of Myc palatial architecture and frescoes in Thebes and the pedimental sculpture (a gigantomachy) from a monumental temple on the hill of Trapeza near Aigion in Achaia. With its stylistic affinities to the first, LAr, pediments of the Temple of Aphaia on Aigina, the Trapeza sculpture strengthens the growing picture of early prosperity around the Corinthian Gulf (further echoed in this year's report of the sanctuary at Mamousia), which in turn challenges long-held assumptions about the dominant artistic role of the NE P?loponn?se. Long-distance connections, trade and ports of entry form another important theme, noting, for example, the findings of the Saronic Harbors Archaeological Research Project at Myc Kalamianos, and the work of the Kythera Island Project on shifting patterns of LRom settlement on the island. Under current economic circumstances, it is hardly surprising to see slightly fewer large-scale excavations than in recent years, other than those funded through major public works. But the cumulative effect of an increasing number of topographical projects, documenting the location of urban centres of all periods and reconstructing changes in their physical form (as, for example, in Triphylia or at Kleonai or Kirrha), is notable both for putting remote regions more firmly on the map and for challenging assumptions about sites and areas thought to be well-understood (Knossos being a case in point). The major gap in this year's account is again rescue archaeology, given the continuing absence of the Archaiologikon Deltion. The syntheses of rescue excavations in Sparta, cited in the Laconia chapter, illustrate the way in which the work of colleagues in the Archaeological Service transforms our understanding especially of the major anc. urban centres. To communicate their work chiefly to local audiences, a number of Ephorias have organized small one- or two-day workshops (in 2009, we note such meetings organized by the 7th EPCA on Elis and the 35th EPCA on Kephallonia and Ithaca), but these are rarely intended for publication. Our inability at present fully to report the vital rescue work of the Archaeological Service is frustrating - and must be doubly so for those who actually conduct the excavations concerned, often in extremely difficult conditions. On a more positive note, we include this year extensive reports of fieldwork and research programmes from 2 of the 6 Archaeological Institutes (of Epirotic Studies and of Aegean Studies - the remaining four being the Institutes of Macedonian and Thracian Studies, of Thessalian Studies, of Peloponnesian Studies and of Cretan Studies). These Institutes are separate branches of the Ministry of Culture with the brief to conduct research programmes, publish material from old excavations and organize exhibitions, conferences and cultural events. Several are cultural foundations of long standing and with very varied histories. Thus, for example, the origins of the Archaeological Institute of Aegean Studies lie in the FERT Institute, founded under the Italian occupation in 1927 to support the work of the Italian Archaeological Mission. After the incorporation of the Dodecanese into the Greek State, the Institute operated as a branch of the Archaeological Service for the Dodecanese until 1977, when it was established as a regional unit of the Ministry of Culture and renamed the Archaeological and Historical Foundation of Rhodes. The Institute was refounded in 2002 as the Archaeological Institute of Aegean Studies, with regional coverage of the Aegean, and in recent years has collaborated particularly closely with the 22nd EPCA in projects such as the unification of the archaeo logical areas of the city of Kos, described more fully in our reports below. Certain major conferences held in Greece over the past year will be of interest to readers of AR. For convenience, these are divided into regional conferences, where primary material of relevance to AR was presented and will be reported fully when the conference proceedings are published, and archaeological conferences on particular themes or periods. Regional: Marathon. The Battle and the Ancient Derne (Marathon, demos of Marathon, September 2008); Cyprus and the East Aegean. Intercultural Contacts from 3000-500 BC (Samos, DAI and AG Leventis Foundation, October 2008); 8th Symposium on Trikala Studies (Trikala, Philos Trikalinon, October/November 2008); First Pancretan Archaeological Congress: Archaeological Research in Crete (Rethymnon, University of Crete and 28th EBA, November 2008); 3rdArchaeological Meeting on Thessaly and Central Greece (Volos, University of Thessaly and Ministry of Culture, March 2009); The Corinthia and the Northeast P?loponn?se: Topography and History from Prehistoric Times until the End of Antiquity (Loutraki, 37th EPCA, DAI and the General Directorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, March 2009); 2Td Annual Meeting on Archaeological Research in Macedonia and Thrace (Thessaloniki, Ministry of Culture, Ministry for Macedonia and Thrace, and Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki, April 2009); Honouring the Dead in the P?loponn?se (Sparta, University of Nottingham Centre for</page><page sequence="2">2 CATHERINE MORGAN Peloponnesian Studies, April 2009); Euboea and Athens: a Colloquium in Memory of Malcolm B.

Structures et ?quipements des march?s antiques (Athens, EfA and ASA, June 2009). 2008-2009 saw 2 significant anniversaries. First, the start of the centenary year (2009-2010) of the Scuola Archeologica Italiana di Atene, marked in June 2009 by a conference entitled Italian Archaeology from a Greek Perspective. Secondly, the 50th anniversary of the National Research Foundation and the 30th of its Centre for Greek and Roman Antiquity - an extraor dinarily dynamic and productive group of scholars who have been exceptional colleagues to all here in the Athenian community. On behalf of the BSA and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, we offer our warmest congrat ulations to both institutions and every good wish for a successful future. As ever, a brief note is due here on the production of AR. The continuing absence of Archaiologikon Deltion has already been noted, and this year too, the proceedings of the previous AEMTh were not published (although we are assured that this is a temporary hiatus). The most up-to-date published source is the Ergon of the Archaeological Society, and we are particu larly grateful to the Society and to its Secretary General, Dr Vasileios Petrakos, for the supply of many of the images used in this year's reports. DeltChAE 2008 has also appeared this year. Otherwise, the most up-to-date published sources remain press reports, and these have been cited where they can be inde pendently verified or linked to a Ministry of Culture Press release. These releases are consultable online at http://www.yppo.gr, following the link to deltia typou where they are listed by date: individual citations thus appear in reports below referenced by date. In such cases, the reports are edited translations of the press release, with related press citations noted. We are also grateful to our many Greek colleagues who have taken time to provide short reports or to verify details of their work as reported in the press. We are, as ever, mostly concerned to present unpublished site reports and work originally published in Greek, and so foreign language reports have been included where they are primary notices of new material. We are grateful to all our contributors for taking time and effort to prepare reports for AR. This edition of AR has been translated and compiled by the BSA Director, the Assistant Director (Robert Pitt) and the Knossos Curatorial Fellow (Todd Whitelaw). We would also like to thank Heinrich Hall for German translation and for keen eyed editorial assistance, John Hayes for final proof-reading and Gina Coulthard, our production editor, for keeping us on course despite our worst endeavours. As ever, the BSA team of Penny Wilson Zarganis, Tania Gerousi, George Bruseker and Vicki Tzavara collected and collated material, liaised with contributors and prepared illustrations. However, a particular tribute is due to the School Secretary, Helen Clark, who took richly deserved retirement in July 2009. Helen has been a stalwart of AR (as of all BSA activities) for some 30 years, and I join all of our colleagues and readers of AR in expressing our appreciation of her work and offering our very best wishes for the years to come. We conclude with a look to the future. Archaeology in Greece has been published jointly with the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies as part of Archaeological Reports since 1954 - and these 55 years are but the latest step in a history of collaborative publication which dates back to the foundation of the British School. This long tradition of dissem inating to the scholarly community the results of archaeological fieldwork conducted in Greece is shared by the Ecole fran?aise d'Ath?nes, which since 1920 has devoted a part of the Bulletin de Correspondance hell?nique to a wide account of archaeo logical research in Greece, Cyprus and, every second year, the Cimmerian Bosphorus. Building upon this tradition, and enabling future generations of scholars to benefit most effectively from the growing volume of information available, lies at the heart of the academic mission of both Schools, and for some while we have contemplated ways in which we might work together to improve the service which we offer to the scholarly community. An electronic resource, which draws upon the strengths of both of our publications, is an essential means to this end. The British School therefore had no hesitation in accepting the invitation extended by the Ecole fran?aise d'Ath?nes in October last to collaborate in the creation of a wholly new research tool named, in our respective languages, Chronique des fouilles en ligne and Archaeology in Greece Online. This resource, which will be accessible via our respective websites from late autumn 2009, will enhance but not replace the Archaeology in Greece section of Archaeological Reports, and will enable a wider scholarly audience worldwide to access our information in the medium best suited to their needs. It is an exciting prospect, and on behalf of the BSA team, I thank my colleague, EfA director Dominique Mulliez, for initiating this collaboration and for his tolerance and good humour throughout the ensuing process. Catherine Morgan The British School at Athens MUSEUMS As the extensive programme of museum redesign and new construction noted last year continues, a useful handbook has been published listing all archaeological museums and collections in Greece by region, with a brief review of their main holdings. A a a e a a E a a (Athens, Ministry of Culture 2008) also appears in a pocket edition in English. Among the new museums inaugurated in 2008-2009, the Acropolis Museum attracted the greatest attention worldwide. Having been partially open to the public for over a year, latterly for the temporary exhibition Nostoi: Repatriated Masterpieces (September-December 2008), it was formally opened on 20th June 2009. Displays in an exhibition space of over 14,000m2, some 10 times larger than that of its predecessor, now include finds from the sanctuaries on the Acropolis slopes as well as the major shrines and monuments of the Acropolis itself (notably the Temple of Athena Nike), with a rich collection of Ar-Rom votive material. Further information is presented at http:// www.theacropolismuseum.gr.</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 3 Elsewhere too, new building and extensive remodelling of existing exhibitions can be reported, for example at the Archaeological Museums of Ioannina (reopened in November 2008), Kalymnos (April 2009) and Chaironeia (May 2009). The new Archaeological Museum of Patras, inaugurated in July 2009, just a month after the Acropolis Museum, is one of the largest archaeological museums in Greece and by far the most adventurous architecturally (the work of the architect Theophanis Bobotis). It houses Myc-LRom material from across Achaia, most notably the rich collection of mosaics from Rom Patras. The Archaeological Museum of Messenia is also a new construction (on the site of the old market of Kalamata destroyed in the 1986 earthquake), enabling a full and repre sentative collection of the rich discoveries from Messenia to be displayed for the first time. Attention has focused on the innovative, geographically-organized layout of exhibitions on the Triphylia, Pylia, Messene and Kalamata regions, which are set alongside thematic displays on subjects such as the 'kingdom' of the palace of Nestor, the Villehardouins and Messenia, and Pylia under Venetian rule (1206-1500). The renaissance in the permanent exhibitions in the National Museum, Athens also continues, with the opening of galleries dedicated to the minor arts and the Vlastos-Serpieri collection in February 2009, and to the collection of Cypriot antiquities in March 2009. 2009 is the 180th anniversary of the establishment of the National Archaeological Museum, and the 120th anniversary of the opening of the present building. As part of the celebrations, the Museum hosted the temporary exhibition Worshipping Women. Ritual and Reality in Classical Athens, organized in collaboration with the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation. ATHENS by Robert K. Pitt Central Athens (1st EPCA: 1st EBA) City Walls. An important and lavishly illustrated doctoral disser tation on the literary, epigraphic, topographic and archaeological evidence for the fortification walls of the anc. city has been produced by A. Theocharakis, A a A a a e ? (3 vols, University of Athens 2007). Acropolis. M. Ioannidou (Director, Acropolis Restoration Service) reports on the work of the Service in 2007 and 2008 (The Acropolis Restoration News [July 2008], 2-4). Parthenon: structural restoration of the dismantled members of the colonnade continued, with 8 columns reset in place, and work begun on resetting the entablature at the level of the architrave. At the W end of the colonnade the dismantling of the metopes was initiated. Propylaia: restoration work on the ceilings of the W hall has been completed with the resetting of restored architectural members of the superstructure. Restoration of the E portico has reached the level of the frieze. Temple of Athena Nike: resetting of restored blocks of the architrave and column bases continued, alongside structural restoration of the intervening layers. Eleftherotypia and To Vima (15/01/09) report the findings of a conservation and excavation project at the back wall of the Stoa of Eumenes II on the S slope of the Acropolis. This wall appears to have been constructed in the 4th Ct BC as part of an athletics facility, and also supported the peripatos above. Many graffiti were discovered on the faces of the blocks, indicating that the structure was part of the first Panathenaic Stadium of the Athenians. Anc. Agora. J.M. Camp (ASCSA) reports on the 2008 excavation season. In section BH (plan: AR 54 [2007-2008], 6) excavations continued below the MByz walls in, over and behind the Painted Stoa. Both the back wall and the interior colonnade of the stoa were found well preserved at its E end. Largely in limestone, the workmanship of the superstructure is of the highest quality. The back wall has limestone foundations which project 0.24m beyond the inner face of the toichobate. Above, 3 toichobate blocks and part of a 4th remain in situ, 1.205m /., 0.935m w., 0.26m h. The tops are finished with a claw chisel and there are 2 pry-holes preserved. Resting on the toichobate are 2 blocks of the outer run of orthostates in situ, 1.205m /., 0.325m w., 0.915m h., which were originally joined with a double-T clamp, now missing. The tops are finished with a claw chisel; the backs are well dressed with a drove and there is a rebate along the bottom, 0.09m h. and 0.01m d.; each block also has a lifting boss preserved. Behind the back wall was found a fragment of a large terracotta pipe associated with the pipeline found in situ running behind the building further W, usually associated with the Kimonian aqueduct bringing water out to the Academy. The fragment was found in MByz fill, suggesting that at the E end of the building the aqueduct had been disturbed. Behind the stoa, generally the fill explored was rubble of the MByz and LRom periods, and so remains have not yet been reached that are contemporary with the stoa. Within the line of the back wall inside the building is a second heavy foundation of soft limestone (Fig. 1) running 0.30-0.35m from the inner face of the foundations of the back wall and measuring 1.04m w. This same run of limestone was found in a similar situation at the W. Possibilities include support for an inner bench or installation; a pre-Persian version of the Stoa Peisianax, attested in a scholion to Aelius Aristeides (in which case the better-preserved remains above would represent a post-Persian rebuilding); or a remnant of the Ar city wall of Athens, no trace of which has yet been identified. Within the building were exposed parts of the 2 E interior Ionic columns. The W of the 2 survives only in its foundations, 2 limestone blocks set side-by-side. The E is better preserved, consisting of a square limestone base, ca. 0.88m on a side, supporting a large cylinder of marble 0.18m h and 0.79m di. (Fig. 2). On top of this is the unfluted limestone shaft of the column itself, 0.59m di., preserved to a h. of 0.5m. The closest 1. Athens, agora: Painted Stoa, foundation and orthostats of soft limestone.</page><page sequence="4">4 ROBERT . PITT parallel is the L5l Ct Pompeion at the Kerameikos. A rubble wall running SW from the easternmost column, 0.6m d. and preserved to 0.6m rests at about the level of the original stoa floor and may represent a later blocking of the interior colonnade. The excavation, in a new section created by the demolition of 2 buildings along Ag. Philippos Street, revealed late fill down to 0.75m below the demolition surface. At the E were reached the tops of rubble walls of the Byz period; to the W, the foundations of the mod. building are more extensive. Several large worked blocks in limestone and marble with anathyrosis and double-T clamps suggest they come from more than one substantial Cl building. The lower part of a marble relief of the Mother of the Gods seated on a throne was found built into a Byz wall. The head of a terracotta horse (Fig. 3) matches others found in this area, reminding us that this NW corner of the Agora was a centre for the Athenian cavalry in Cl and Hel times. In section , excavation took place in an area of a cluster of small buildings of the Cl period, immediately S of the Tholos, which were put out of use in the Hel period by the shifting of the course of a road. To the E of these buildings is the shop of Simon the cobbler, to the W the 'Strategeion'. The aim of the excavation was to determine whether these buildings - small, crowded and irregular in their plans - were public or private and, if private, whether they had a commercial function. The discovery of a tile-lined well should confirm the interpretation of the area as an open courtyard. A bg lamp from the well suggests that it went out of use close to the 2nd quarter of the 4th Ct. Elsewhere in the area, various floor levels and pits were dug, mostly dating to the 4th Ct. Two fractional silver coins (Fig. 4) were found, plus a large fragment of an amphora with a graffito (Fig. 5). In many instances the fill contained numerous sherds of the 8th and 7th Cts BC, perhaps indicative of earlier houses or disturbed burials. 4.

Evidence has been discovered for hunter-gathers at the cave site from the upper Pal through to the Mes. A 2nd phase of occupation between the MNeo and EBA has produced tools manufactured from radiolarite and various forms of flint. Animals found included hare, deer and a species of now-extinct horse. Plant remains included wild cereals and pulses. Terracotta figurines from the LAr-Hel periods indicate later religious use. The Sacred Way.

To Vima (18/03/09) reports that excavations carried out on a plot at 7 P?reos Street by M. Raftopoulou (26th EPCA) revealed 2 phases of a structure identified as a shrine. The older phase (5.5m 8.6m) dates to the LAr period; the later (7.35m 5.5m) to the 4th Ct BC. Both buildings had gates at the entrance, in front of which was found an altar (1.55m Im). In another plot, at 30 P?reos Street, excavations uncovered hydraulic installations of the 5th Ct BC with tanks, a well and clay pipes. Voula. To Vima (25/02/09) reports the discovery by K.

K. Kaza-Papageorgiou (AAA 39 [2006], 45-60) reports the discovery of an extensive EH cemetery on the side of a low hill a few metres from the last bay of Asteria on the Pounda peninsula. Clusters of small chamber tombs were cut into the hard limestone and a long wall encloses the cemetery on the side facing the sea. Southern Attica (2nd EPCA: 1st EBA) Thorikos. In 2008 a topographical survey of the industrial quarter and the theatre area was undertaken by R.

Documentation of all visible remains brought to light a hitherto unknown cistern in the industrial quarter. Central Attica Markopoulo. E. Salavoura reports (AAA 39 [2006], 61-82) the excavation of a cluster of 4 small Myc chamber tombs with long dromoi on the SE edge of the plain of Merenda. The tombs contained 10 burials accompanied by much local pottery; of particular interest are a bovine figurine and a bronze razor. The excavator interprets the site as a small family cemetery which began in LHIILA2 and continued in use until LHIIIB-LHIIIC. Cholargos. Excavations associated with the construction of the metro (To Vima [23/22/08]) have brought to light a stretch of a 5th Ct BC road with drainage pipes 0.4m di. A roadside cemetery, also of the 5th Ct, contained the larnax burial of an infant, with grave goods including a bg cup. Northern and Northwestern Attica Halandri. Eleftherotypia, To Vima, Apogevmatini and Ta Nea (30/01/09) report the discovery of a section of the road which brought marble from the Penteli quarries into central Athens. The excavation by the 2nd EPCA of a plot at 133 Pentelis Avenue revealed a 19.7m /. stretch of the road, 3.3m w. with wheel ruts preserved. Small finds included a lead weight and Fr coins. Nea Erythrea. To Vima (04/06/08) reports the excavation by the 2nd EPCA of a 0.2ha plot at the junction of Ethnikis Antistaseos Street and Lemnou Street.

Postholes of huts were found, with successive floors of packed earth and gravel, which included stone tools, obsidian blades and small shallow storage pits containing pots. Marathon, Tsepi. M. Pantelidou-Gofas (ASA) reports (Ergon [2008], 13-23) on continued excavation of the EH cemetery. The fa?ade of tomb 53 was carefully constructed of stones from the nearby Scorpios river and is significantly smaller than the other tombs (1.3m 1.4m, instead of the more usual 1.5m</page><page sequence="6">6 CATHERINE MORGAN 2.5m). The apsidal pit of the tomb (0.94m 0.8m, 0.81m d.) is lined with slate and the floors paved with small stones. The entrance on the E has 2 steps carved into the ground. The grave was full of bones, including 14 skulls scattered without order. The skeleton of the last burial to the E side was found lying above a mass of bones. The form of the tomb is not that of the original; the burial pit was lined and covered with slabs, but later converted by the construction of steps, an entrance and threshold in keeping with burial habits of the period. In its final form, the tomb was a rectangular structure surrounded by a per?bolos of small stones. Tomb 54 lies beside a stone mound and lacks a per?bolos. Irregular slabs covered the tomb at the level of the anc. surface and it was surrounded on 3 sides by river stones. The entrance area was full of large closely packed upright cobbles. Two stelai were placed at the sides of the tomb, cut off above ground level. The entrance slab was found in situ. The entrance has a stone threshold; a large arch-shaped stone was used as a lintel above. The tomb was full of bones, including 7 skulls. Bones of the last skeleton were found right beside the entrance, together with small stones and fragments from large vessels, which were not found elsewhere in the tomb. The skull had been broken and the jaw was found separated from it; a large pebble had been placed in the mouth, as had previously been discovered in tombs 42, 45 and 68. It appears that the tomb was deliberately put out of use, judging from the absence of a per?bolos, the stones of which had been thrown in to fill the entrance and thus impede the tomb's further use. Skala Oropou. A. Mazarakis Ainian (ASA) reports (Ergon [2008], 24-34) on continued excavation. In 2008, the remaining section of building was excavated and proved to be elliptical (4.3m 7.3m) with an entrance at the S side and walls 0.5m d. (Fig. 6). To the E of the stone hearth found in 2007 a pit full of ashes was revealed. From these two hearths ash had spread all over the floor of the building. Sherds of the 2nd half of the 8th Ct were found, with loomweights and a serpentine seal depicting a bird. of the building, two 12m /. stretches of per?bolos walls, one contemporaneous with the elliptical building, the other later, perhaps defined the S section of an anc. road. A few meters away to the NW two other elliptical structures, and E, came to light built one on top of the other, along with remains of other buildings and periboloi. Building , 8.6m /. and 5.4m w., built partially on top of the older E, belongs to a transitional period from the Geo to the EAr and was in use until the 6th Ct. The interior was paved with large stones and contained much ash and carbonized fruit. In the S part of the building a hearth was found built with fragments of large pots within a circle of small stones. The door, on the S side, had a threshold of large stones. The NE quarter of the interior is separated from the rest by a wall. Inside the building and along the wall were found clay loomweights, beads, stone weights, metal objects, mainly iron, and EAr sherds. Outside building to the SE was found a pit filled with ash, which may be the remains of a posthole to be associated with another parallel to the building's W wall, which may have supported a roof to protect the building from rain, or may belong to a 3rd elliptical structure. Of the older building E (9m /., 5.5m w.) only a small section was investigated. Pottery from the structure dates to the end of the 8th Ct., while outside the building part of the neck of a LGeo Attic amphora was discovered. The per?bolos, outside and W of buildings and E, was lm thick, remarkable for the site. E of the 2 elliptical buildings, 3 other walls (2 Geo, 1 Ar) were exposed. ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF with KYTHERA (26th EPCA: 1st EBA) Salamis Kanakia Y. Lolos (Ioannina) reports (Akamas 3 [2009], 2-8; cf. Ta Nea and Ethnos [10/03/09]) on the 2008 season of excavation which focused on the Myc ?lite residence on the acropolis and the neighbouring Myc cemetery. On the acropolis, building , the central residence (of which 45 rooms and spaces have so far been revealed, covering an area of at least 750m2), was further investigated. Excavation of one room of the wing was completed: this was attached to the so called One-roomed House' (A2). of the entrance to the building, a reception or waiting area was revealed. This was probably roofed from the beginning, and was set at a lower level than the rooms to the S of it: the main approach was through a wide entrance way on the W side with a built threshold. On the W side of this area, stone steps (oriented N-S, 2.75m w.) led down into the interior of the building. A stone bench (2.5m /., 0.55m average d. and 0.4m h.), along the S wall, could seat 6 people. An undecorated terracotta bath-tub (1.5m /., 0.6m w. at centre and 0.5m h.) was set into the floor almost touching the wall. The area produced a large quantity of LHIIIB-LHIIIC E pottery, 2 tripod chytres, 50 stone tools and small objects, and fragments of a terracotta figurine. In the cemetery, an oval tumulus (20m 25m, over 2m h.) was discovered, set on bedrock within a stone kerb on the W SW side, and with a per?bolos wall of large, unworked stones set around and at some distance from it. The tumulus did not contain burials. It was likely marked by a stele, given the discovery of an approximately rectangular, roughly worked, thick stone slab, now set aside on its E side. A few Myc sherds were included in the tumulus fill; a clear Myc stratum discerned a few metres from the W side provides good relative dating o ^Som \g) "e . ron*** sooe 6.

Two large openings cut into the bedrock in antiquity, both empty of finds, are open to various interpretations (as remains of tomb robbing, unfinished graves, looted cenotaphs or bothroi for cult offerings). A LCl-Hel t?menos is located close by. The likely ritual function of the tumulus is reinforced by the presence a few metres from its W side of a paved, approximately round exedra. LMyc pottery was found on its surface, along with 2 fragments of terracotta figurines and a few animal bones. The pottery shapes are mostly open (kylikes, skyphoi and chytres) and are similar to those in use in the last phase of activity in the residence. Finally, surface survey was undertaken of a limited part of the area surrounding Kanakia. An anc. (possibly Hel) round well (di. 1.2-1.3m), cut into the limestone bedrock, was recorded on the site of the mod. coastal well, directly below the W side of the Myc acropolis. The quarry for the grey limestone used for the Myc residence was located close to the acropolis towards the SE (towards Pyrgiakoni), where today quarries are in use as refuse dumps. Other focuses of survey were the boundary of the Myc cemetery; documentation of a later (Hel) per?bolos on the SE side of the acropolis, ca. 50m /. and generally oriented E-W; and documentation and evaluation of features inside the LCl-Hel t?menos noted above. Mavrovouni. G. Kakava and S. Zyrba report (Akamas 3 [2009], 19-22) on rescue excavation of LCh and EByz remains on the Sousti property, 200m from the Gulf of Aianteio and 350m from the village of that name. Three tombs were excavated. Tomb I is a vaulted cist, built of rubble masonry with lime plaster, which contained 2 successive burial deposits. The upper, which contained the scattered bones of 6 adults, was almost entirely without goods, and probably represents secondary reburial. The lower contained 2 disintegrating adult skeletons, with 7 plainware vessels, a bronze pin and a bronze probe. Bronze and iron nails indicate that the deceased had been buried on a wooden bier. The tomb dates between the 5th and 6th Ct AD. Tomb II lies SW of tomb I, and is a wide, rectangular cist of roughly worked irregular masonry (0.4-0.5m thick) with lime plaster, preserved to a maximum h. of 0.65m, and with a rounded vault. It was entered from the E; the steps down into the tomb, preserved in situ, are made of bricks with wavy-line finger impressions. Many burials were made in 2 episodes. In the upper, the skeletal material was scattered, with the remains of at least 8 crania in the NW part of the chamber, with many fewer bones, chiefly from the lower limbs, over the remaining area. There were almost no grave goods - merely parts of a pair of bronze earrings, a silver earring, 2 small iron nails and a vase at the E side of the tomb. The presence of this jewellery is taken by the excavators to imply that at least 2 of the deceased were women. In the lower level, 3 skeletons were uncovered close to the S long wall of the tomb, in extended, supine position, directly on the ground. Three adult crania and one of a small child were found at the NW corner, while a quantity of lower limb bones was found along the side. Despite the poor condition of the skeletal material, 7 burials could be recognized, accompanied by rich goods. A vessel was found broken at the entrance of the tomb: personal ornament included a silver and a bronze pin, 4 bronze buckles (including one of the de Bolgota type), a pair of bronze earrings, a bronze ring and a small bronze bell, as well as one silver and 2 bronze probes. In this level also were iron nails of various sizes and 2 iron rings. The goods assist in identifying the gender and age of the deceased: 6 were adults and one a child (to whom the bell belonged), and at least 3 of the adults were men, perhaps of military or other official rank to judge from the form of the buckles. The large quantity of lime in the upper level supports the view that the victims of some epidemic were buried together in an existing and spacious grave. The tomb generally dates to the 6th and 7S Cts AD. Tomb III, which is partially destroyed, lies SE of tomb II and parallel to tomb I. It is a built family tomb, of the same dimensions, construction and orientation as tomb 1. It was probably a chamber tomb, but there is insufficient evidence for the form of the roof. It contained 5 contemporary burials. Three skeletons were found along the S long side; traces of a 4th cranium, with part of a bronze earring above it, were observed in the NW corner. This skeleton must have been laid along the wall and was mostly destroyed when the tomb was damaged. A 5th, smaller and more delicate cranium was found at roughly the level of the waist of the 2nd skeleton; it appears to belong to a small child buried beside its mother. The grave goods were mostly found buried beneath the collapsed tomb walls on the N, W and S sides, with personal items inside or around the crania. Sherds from 7 plainware vessels were collected, along with bronze and silver jewellery (one silver and 4 bronze earrings, one bronze and 2 silver pins, part of a bronze necklace, a silver coin used as a pendant, 2 bronze probes, a small bronze bell and many small iron rings probably from a belt). Inside cranium 2 was a bronze 20 nummus coin of the reign of the Emperor Phokas (602-610) from the mint of Constantinople, which gives a secure tpq of the E7th Ct AD for the tomb itself. Tombs I and III were at the same d., and set parallel to each other, 0.3m apart. They are simple constructions of approxi mately the same dimensions. Tomb II, however, is larger and belongs to a particular category of vaulted tomb with steps down from the entrance which appears in the 6th Ct. It is a more elaborate and costly structure, and this, together with the notable grave goods, indicates that those buried there were members of a prominent local family. E of tomb III, a wall may be part of a destroyed 4th tomb, since there is a large quantity of brick and tile (much of which has similar finger impressions), lime plaster, sherds of combed ware and bone. In the surrounding area part of a curved stone wall was excavated, plus sections of road of different periods. Finally, an extensive pyre was revealed, with portable finds which seem to date it earlier than the ECh period. The discovery of at least 3 family tombs at this site reinforces the hypothesis that there was a permanent settlement somewhere in the wider area in ECh times. It complements the discovery of a 6th Ct vaulted tomb at Pyrgiakoni, an E7th Ct vaulted tomb at Perani and ECh tombs at Ag. Dimitrios and Ag. Athanasios, near Aianteio. Saronic Harbors Archaeological Research Project (SHARP) D. Pullen (AS CSA/Florida) and T. Tartaron (ASCSA/Pennsylvania) report on a 2nd season of fieldwork. In 2008, as in 2007, research focused on the Myc settlement at Korphos-Kalamianos and on the surrounding territory. Kalamianos was a major harbour settlement of the Myc palatial period, with a large urban centre that was a focus of Myc activity extending well beyond the site itself. Work continued on the mapping of architectural features. Survey and drawing of structures continued at Kalamianos: sectors 5 and 9 were targeted, in addition to the fortification wall. While over much of the site buildings are set some distance apart, sector 5 has produced the densest concentration of architecture (Fig. 7). Two streets or alleys allow access between structures. One of these, structure 5-1223, seems to be a major organizational feature of sector 5, and can be traced for nearly 60m N-S in 3 segments which are continuous although</page><page sequence="8">8 CATHERINE MORGAN 7. SHARP, Korphos-Kalamianos: sector 5 features. not perfectly aligned. E of the part of this street lies building 5-II, a very large structure with numerous rooms, a clear entrance on the W and several inbuilt features (perhaps bins or platforms). To the W lies building 5-VIII, a structure with 6 parallel units oriented N-S, each of which has 3 to 4 rooms running N-S. The structure is thus an insula like those seen elsewhere in the Aegean. One of the units, B2-B3, was apparently rebuilt at a slightly higher level and with somewhat larger stones. Sector 9 has produced some of the clearest evidence for post-Myc reuse at Kalamianos. Building 9-IV (Fig. 8), a large Myc structure of canonical masonry, contains a possible kiln, the stone packing of which is associated with finger impressed Rom tiles and spiral grooved ware. Elsewhere in the vicinity, LRom 1 and 2 amphora rims were found. Kalamianos had a fortification circuit that enclosed all of the architecture (ca. 4ha), as well as large areas of open land (ca. 3ha). Two probable gates have been identified. A long wall (Fig. 8) runs from the E shore to the W, cutting off the Kalamianos peninsula. Near the middle of the wall, 2 parallel walls, 7-XXIV and 7-XIX, funnel access past a well constructed tower (7-XV) to the narrow entrance to the site. To the SE, another possible gate complex, 9-V, controlled access between the lower, built-up portion of the site and the higher, unoccupied but fortified, hilltop. To the W and SW, the wall is identified only in small sections. Any wall along the S edge of the site would probably lie below the mod. sea level. Intensive archaeological survey of the Kalamianos site was completed. Finds collected from individual rooms, within walls and between buildings allowed the buildings to be dated with varying degrees of precision. Preliminary analysis suggests that the material is almost entirely LHIIIB in date, with very little earlier or later Myc. Almost half of the site was covered, although a significant percentage of the survey area could not be walked due to steep slopes or dense vegetation. Beyond Kalamianos, the survey identified FNeo, EBA, LBA, Cl/Hel and Emod. sites. There is widespread evidence for small Myc enclosures, some of which may have had associated towers. In all instances these enclosures have clear views over the surrounding territory and control natural passages into the region. E of Korphos bay, between the mod. village and Kalamianos, a series of stone cairns previously interpreted as Hel boundary markers was re-examined. Based on their form and the ceramics contained in them, they probably represent the remains of another EBA fortified site, as nearby Vayia and Vassa, although they may have been reused in later periods. On a low ridge between 2 hilltops at Akrotirio Stiri, high above Kalamianos, a 2nd large Myc settlement was discovered, overlooking a steep cliff and with an expansive view of the Saronic Gulf to the E. This settlement is smaller than that at Kalamianos (the main part of the complex is ca. 200m 70m), but the architecture and chronology are similar (Fig. 9). From the small hill S of the site, Kalamianos and the Saronic Gulf stretching out to the S are in plain view, while from the cliff delimiting the settlement to the E, there is a much broader view of the Saronic coasts, including Attica and Salamis. Thus, the community at Stiri could monitor maritime traffic on the Saronic Gulf, as well as the land passes above Kalamianos. Geological and geomorphological research (R. Dunn: Norwich, Vermont) focused on problems of erosion and sedi mentation, hydrology and coastline change over time, and especially on karstic features and the hydrology of the region. The lines of the bedrock joints were mapped across the site. These joints often split into so-called fissures which occur in association with architecture; as they seem to be sources of fresh water, their distribution may be a factor in the location of buildings. Coring was undertaken on the Kalamianos site and in the region. One core, within building 7-1, had a few particles of partially burnt clay (perhaps burnt mud-brick or daub), indicating the presence of cultural deposits. Kea Karthaia. Publication: E. Simantoni-Bournia, L.G. Mendoni and T.-M. Panagou, A A A ... a ... (Athens, TAPA 2009; in Greek, English and French). Kythera Kythera Island Project. C. Broodbank (BSA/London) and E. Kiriatzi (BSA) report on the 2008 study season. Study of the Rom pottery was a principal objective: the Rom component at Kastri and at 26 further sites was examined and the absence of Rom material at many more sites verified (Fig. 10). Sites selected included large coastal establishments (for example, site 129) and inland sites that range substantially in size (for example, sites 020 and 108). Overall, LRom is most common (17 sites with substantial quantities of sherds plus 6 with tiny amounts), but a substantial amount of MRom is also notable: distinct ERom phenomena are small, coastal sites rich in finewares and a major Hel and/or ERom presence at Diakofti, the alternative harbour to Kastri, at a period when activity at Kastri is reduced. There are strong indications of distinctions between assemblages at different kinds of sites, and much evidence for shifting patterns of off-island contacts and activity well into the L7th Ct AD. One further Cl site (082) emerged. A large amount of MByz to E/MVen pottery (ca. 12th-16th Ct AD) was studied: a particularly fruitful comparison was made between 2 large inland sites, the slightly earlier site</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 9 9. SHARP, Stiri: architecture at the Myc settlement.</page><page sequence="10">10 CATHERINE MORGAN 108 and site 174, the late phase at which overlaps with the 18th Ct AD start of regular census records. Two hundred samples of MByz to E/MVen wares were selected for p?trographie and chemical analysis, the largest-scale sampling of such material yet undertaken in the Aegean. Analysis of the Cl-Rom metallurgical debris collected by the survey (primarily ca. 45kg of slag, mostly from 23 sites) continues (M. Georgakopoulou). The widespread occurrence of small-scale Cl-Rom debris contrasts strikingly with the extremely restricted distribution of PH copper metallurgy, though it remains far from ubiquitous. Specific instances of Cl and Rom metallurgy can be identified, and in the case of multi period sites, internal spatial resolution is sometimes sufficient to indicate an earlier or later date for such activity. All slags have been examined macroscopically, revealing a distinction between a group with a flow texture on their upper surface, sometimes with iron ore fragments, commonly associated with a Kytheran or S Laconian smelting origin (bloomery smelting has been inferred from Cl fragments in the Kastri excavation material) and another group comprising residues from small smithing hearths. On pure Cl sites, the 2 types do not coincide, perhaps suggesting specialized production areas. These preliminary observations are currently being tested through analytical examination (chemical and microstructural) of a large sample selected to cover both slag-type and inter-site variation. Sklere. T. Gregory (Ohio) reports (DeltChAE 39 [2008], 259 68) on a survey of the fortified site at Sklere, identified with the fortress of Ag. Dimitrios, conducted as part of the Australian Palaiochora-Kythera Archaeological Project of the Australian Institute in Athens. Sklere is a ridge running NW-SE immediately W of Aroniadika, which dominates the plain between Aroniadika and Potamos. There is a significant concentration of 16th Ct pottery on the central part of the ridge and in the immediate vicinity of the church of Ag. Dimitrios, as well as well-preserved walls and large stone piles E of the church and just below (W of) the high point of the ridge. The stone piles stand out for their size and for the fact that they retain the distinct shapes of collapsed features. Thus two large stone features on the N, each over lm h. (that on the W being 15m /. and ca. 5m w.), have clearly defined E-W walls ca. 1.5m w. The walls are broken by a probable passageway ca. 2.5m w. mid-way between the stone piles. Another similar stone pile is 10. Kythera: site location map, showing all sites. Those processed in 2008 are marked by labels.</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 11 located on the SW, ca. 12m 5m and up to 1.5m h., with a depression in the top. To the E of this is an elongated feature running SW-NE, with a distinct circular depression in the E side: this feature reaches the high point of the ridge and meets the stone feature on the E end of the part of the site. Taken together, it is possible to see these stone features as towers and strong points joined into a rudimentary defensive circuit, ca. 40m2. This cannot have been a true castle, as the high point of the ridge is left outside anything that can be considered part of the fortifications. Furthermore, all the construction is in dry stone technique, which is not appropriate for any significant Ven fortification. It may rather be a local attempt to provide a place of concealment and safety from Ot raids after the sack of Palaiochora in 1537 (noting the local petition to Venice for assistance in 1543). Antikythera Anc. Aigilia. Ethnos (20/11/08) cites a report by A. Tsaravopoulos (26th EPCA) of excavation and cleaning of the Hel fortifications. CORINTHIA (37th EPCA: 25th EBA) Isthmia. E. Gebhard (ASCSA/Chicago) reports. Further study of the Ar temple (F. Hemans) confirmed the elevation of the floors of the pteron and the top of the sty lobate. What had been considered to be a step at the SE corner of the fa?ade in fact belongs to a foundation for the sty lobate. The circular base interpreted as supporting the marble perirrhante rion at the NE pteron bears evidence of being set into the floor before being finished, and the floor was evidently laid at the same time against it. The monument is contemporary with the construction of the temple. The same may be true of an iron tripod of the 7th Ct BC, the feet of which were found in situ adjacent to the perirrhanterion base. Study of the distribution of LAr and Cl cooking wares (M. Risser, . Cheney and E. Michael) shows that roasting and boiling of sacrificial meat generally took place in different parts of the sanctuary, with some meat roasted at the altar and the remainder boiled in proximity to the communal feast. Some stewpots and covered serving platters from the reservoir (Large Circular Pit) are unusually large, while vessels used for individual servings are slightly smaller than similar examples from domestic contexts in Corinth. Kotylai, skyphoi and one handled cups may have fulfilled a dual function at the feast, used both as bowls for food and cups for wine. Study of worked stone tools (I. Gatsov, P. Nadelzheva) nears completion: objects relate to food production (querns and other grinding stones) and construction (masons' floats and hammers), and also include gaming boards and a sun dial. T. Gregory (ASCSA/Ohio) reports on a further study season on finds from the Rom bath, the area E of the t?menos (East Field), and the Byz fortress. Conservation of the mosaics in the Rom bath continued, especially those in rooms VI and XII, as did the cleaning and stabilization of old trenches in the areas S of the Rom bath and E of the t?menos. In the area of the Rom bath, a new series of doorways to the Cl bath was discovered, and a dry stone wall constructed along the whole S side of the Rom bath. Study of the anc. architectural blocks in the area of the so called Hexamilion outworks, NE of the Rom bath, continued, with a pilot study for the use of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology for the location and detailed recording of these blocks in the field. Many previously unknown architectural pieces were identified, perhaps all from the same building. Thus 2 additional Doric epistyle-frieze blocks were identified, bringing the total of blocks of this type to 10. The removal of soil and landscaping of the area of the Hexamilion outworks, between the Rom bath and the Byz fortress, along the S side of the large ravine that runs from the centre of the Isthmus to the Saronic Gulf, resulted in the levelling of much of the soil E of the bath and S of the Hexamilion. In this operation, designed to open the area to visitors, the foundations of a large building (ca. 10m 16m) of the lst-2nd Ct AD were discovered. This building was entered through a doorway leading from the area NE of the Rom bath, and was connected in some way with the large E-W building(s) that lie essentially unexplored between the bath and the fortress. Kenchreai. E. Korka (Ministry of Culture), J. Rife (ASCSA/Macalester College) and P. Kasimi (37th EPCA) report on a further season of excavation on the Koutsongila ridge of the anc. harbour in the 3 major areas begun in 2007. Nine new trenches were opened and 5 distinct buildings explored (Fig. 11). Area A is the open slope at the S end of Koutsongila, with a commanding view of the harbour (Fig. 12). Exploration focused on a substantial long wall and a rectangular building, first uncovered in 2007 (Fig. 13). A 6m /. stretch of a massive wall was uncovered, with a foundation of blocks and overlying rubble in irregular courses. Its purpose and date are uncertain, but against its W face is a dense deposit of large E-MRom sherds: thus the wall was constructed no later than the ERom period (lst-2nd Ct AD). Its plan, the associated stratigraphy and the absence of nearby walls all suggest that the structure was neither part of an enclosed building nor served to retain soil. It may have defined a significant space, for example to delimit settlement or trace a precinct. Excavation of the rectangular building (ca. 7.9m 5.8m) was completed. Three walls on a prominent bedrock outcrop survive. These consist of a few recycled ashlar blocks and dense rubble set in a coarse mortar and finished on the interior with a fine white plaster. The S wall is poorly preserved, but the entrance seems to have been located in the SE corner, where 2 adjacent steps (one paved) were cut into the bedrock. This building had 3 main phases of use from the ERom to EByz periods. In its original form, starting in the 1st Ct AD, it had a circular pit at its centre (ca. 0.91m di. 0.33m d.) and a low bench or platform along the back (N) wall. The pit might have held a large vessel or basin supported by struts in the manner of a tripod, or it might have been a firepit for a brazier that was later cleaned out. Together with the facing bench, it seems to indicate some ritual activity, such as ablutions or sacrifices. After this, perhaps in the 4th-5th Ct, a series of 5 low, parallel compartments oriented N-S (ca. 0.75 0.85m w.) were made across the middle of the building from strips of mortar and rubble. The presence of numerous human bones, lamps and coins, intermingled by later disturbance, suggests that these compartments contained multiple burials. In the 6th-7th Ct, cist graves (G46-48, G55, G56, G59) were dug around the edges of the dilapidated and plundered building. It is noteworthy that a conspicuous ERom building with a ritual function was converted to funerary use in LAntiquity, as the major cemetery to the was apparently expanding S toward the harbour. Area is the low-lying area near the SE edge of Koutsongila where abundant structural remains were found in 2007 (Fig. 14). Two ERom buildings can be identified, or perhaps one large complex with 2 distinct wings, separated by a narrow</page><page sequence="12">12 CATHERINE MORGAN 11. Kenchreai, Koutsongila ridge.</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 13 12. Kenchreai, Koutsongila ridge: area A.</page><page sequence="14">14 CATHERINE MORGAN passageway. They are situateci on roughly the same axis as the complex (probably a seaside villa) which was excavated at the base of the mole in the 1960s and share many structural features with it. Only the backs of the buildings have so far been excavated, so their size remains unknown, but they might have measured as much as 25-30m front to back, assuming that they extended all the way to the anc. cliff edge. To the was a large rectangular structure with irregular rubble walls, founded directly onto the bedrock outcrop and paved with uneven terracotta tiles (Fig. 15). Its most distinctive feature is a series of 5 almost conical pits thinly lined with plaster (ca. 0.86m di. and ca. 0.3m d.). These were probably either cuttings for large vessels (pithoi) or bothroi for storage. The pits, together with the overall appearance of the structure, point to a utilitarian or small-scale industrial function, such as a workshop or storage space. The relationship between this building and the one to the S is uncertain, but their proximity suggests that they were linked. The building seems to have operated during the ERom period, but it remains unclear whether it was first used in the 1st or 2nd Ct. In contrast, the building to the S was opulent (Figs 14, 16). The walls were built from a mixture of fine brick masonry and irregular rubble. Fragments of painted plaster and moulded marble revetment in variegated colours and textures (Fig. 17) found throughout the building show that the walls had a decorative finish, while small tesserae in diverse colours come from the paved floor. Three rooms have been excavated. The northernmost is a narrow corridor with a well at the back. This well was filled to a d. of ca. 5m with structural and domestic debris, such as kitchen vessels and animal bones, which was apparently dumped when the building was cleaned after either a period of total disuse or an event of destruction, such as the major earthquake(s) that struck the region in the L4th Ct. To the S is a finely constructed water tank with a lead pipe in the SW corner draining into the 3rd space to the S, which has a central basin surrounded by a channel. The small scale of these hydraulic features, and the frequent presence of kitchen vessels and faunal remains, indicate that this is a private, rather than a large public, bathing facility, within a larger house. It appears to have been built and first used during the E-MRom periods (ca. lst-3rd Ct), but may also have had a LRom phase. Area C is located in the heart of the cemetery, W of tombs 3 and 23, where 2 wheelruts and 16 LRom-EByz cist graves had been uncovered. Excavation of the Southwest Building, an ERom above-ground chamber tomb, was completed. This rectangular building (ca. 6.2m 5.8m) had ashlar foundations set into bedrock and walls of brick in even courses finished with white plaster. Inside, the wall had a bench cut from bedrock and the S wall a bench built from large slabs. In the middle W area of the floor, which was finished with mortar, cuttings may indicate the presence of altars. The rock-cut cist in the bench (G50) reveals that the building was used for burial. However, the Southwest Building had collapsed in a single event during the M2nd Ct (or later) before it was filled with burials. The tomb was never rebuilt and the ashlar foundations were robbed, but during LAntiquity (as late as the 6th Ct) simple cist graves were created in the destruction debris and the robbed foundation trenches (G53, G58, G60).</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 15 Investigation of the loculi inside tomb 7 was completed. These contained the remains of at least 37 individuals of all ages who had been buried during the Llst-3rd Ct. The numerous funerary artefacts represented types well-known from other tombs on Koutsongila: glass vessels, coins, earrings and finger rings, bone pins and lamps. Since tomb 7 seems to have received less attention from looters than many other chambers on Koutsongila, it will provide especially good evidence for reconstructing funerary rituals. Important observations derive from these discoveries concerning social structure, topography and settlement history at Rom Kenchreai. First, the wealth implied by decorative art in the buildings of area B, as well as in the richest of the chamber tombs, reflects the great prosperity of local ?lites. The high quality of the wall-painting, marble sculpture and mosaic paving on Koutsongila compares with the finest instances from Rom Corinth. Moreover, we continue to find artefacts, partic ularly vessels and coins, that reveal the port's E connections. Secondly, the small ERom building with a ritual function in area A might indicate the presence of a sanctuary or demarcate the S limit of the cemetery. Thirdly, the above-ground tomb in area C is the first of its type found on Koutsongila. Its situation 15. Kenchreai, Koutsongila ridge: building in area B, from NW. just W of the wheelruts shows that this main road into the harbour was flanked by impressive tombs. Finally, evidence for burial activity across the ridge until the L6th or 7th Ct proves that the port settlement survived into EByz times, but apparently contracted S toward the harbour.

The house consists of 9 rooms and a central courtyard. Two rooms flank a corridor leading from the entrance on Lechaion Road South to the court. The remainder flank the courtyard. The complex was supplied with water from a well in the court. 16. Kenchreai, Koutsongila ridge: S building in area B, from NW. iwwvyi 17.

The house was built in the 2nd half of the 11th Ct and remained occupied for 2 centuries. In the 13th Ct, the W range of rooms was assimilated into a property standing to the W, while the E part of the house continued in independent use. Three spaces produced significant metal finds (Fig. 20). The SW room, a semi-basement, had an assemblage of Fr tools including a scythe, a knife, an axe-hammer and a spear point. Beneath the stair ascending to the 2nd storey were a Byz ladle or lamp, an adze-hammer and a keyhole plaque. Outside and to the NW was a dump of iron door fittings, including parts of lock mechanisms and keyhole plaques. The house provides a valuable complement to the Fr complex excavated by C.K. Williams S of the museum in the 1990s and has parallels in the upper strata of the Stoa Poikile in the Athenian Agora. The Med house will be conserved and will remain exposed as an example of a Byz domicile at Corinth. Stymphalos. H. Williams (Canadian Institute/British Columbia) reports on continuing study of the pottery, lamps and figurines from the 1994-2005 excavations, and on the preparation of an exhibition for the new 19th Ct folk-life museum being built by the Piraeus Bank Foundation near the lake. In June 2009, deep cores were drilled in and around the lake as part of a project to study the geomorphological history of the area. Taken with smaller cores recovered in 2007, these offer much promising material on the environmental history of the site through the past millennia.</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 17 20.

Sherds from deposits in grid squares, M12, N17, K14/15, L17, F18 and G18 were examined. An additional study was conducted on pottery from a votive deposit excavated by Biegen in 1925 to the E of the site. At the Temple of Zeus, work continued on the foundations and krepidoma at the E end, especially the NE corner, and on restoration of the columns. Classification and registration of fragments of architectural sculpture continued, mostly from the Ar and LCI Temples of Zeus. Several larger fragments with preserved mutules and guttae retain some of the original painted decoration on the worn marble surface (Fig. 21). Nemea, Agia Sotira cemetery. R.A.K. Smith (Canadian Institute/Brock), M.K. Dabney and J.C. Wright (Bryn Mawr College) report on the 2008 season of excavation in the LBA chamber-tomb cemetery on the hillside of Ag. Sotira, outside the village of Koutsomadi near anc. Nemea. Newly-acquired land of the field investigated in 2006 and 2007 (Fig. 22) was explored using ground-penetrating radar and magnetometry, with test trenches to investigate anomalies. No tombs were found. This was followed by an extensive programme of test trenching. Trenches were excavated E-W at ca. 4m intervals. A fissure at the NW limit of this area proved to be the collapsed chamber of tomb 6, making it possible to excavate both the chamber and the dromos simultaneously. 21.

Sotira: trench plan.</page><page sequence="18">18 CATHERINE MORGAN The tomb had undergone multiple openings. Since in most cases the dromos was excavated down to the floor level of its previous use, only 2 major fill episodes are clearly visible. Pottery from the dromos included carinated kylix sherds. Excavation of the stomion correlated well with the various levels observed in the dromos. The lowest level, beneath the blocking wall, contained multiple thinly compressed floor levels, from which samples were taken for micromorpholog ical analysis. Above these levels, it is apparent that the stomion was rebuilt during a secondary use of the tomb. The S side, facing the dromos, was set back, and the top of the E face of the doorway reconstructed with rubble masonry. This masonry continued into the chamber E of the stomion. It seems that during an opening of the tomb, the E side of the stomion and part of the SE portion of the chamber collapsed and were rebuilt. Evidence for this was preserved in stratified layers of humus and silt sloping down into the collapsed chamber from S to N. In associated levels, 2 vessels, prelimi narily dated to the Geo period, were discovered above the stomion. Excavation of the chamber revealed the interment of a minimum of 9 individuals with 14 ceramic vessels. On the floor was a layer of poorly preserved burials, including 2 primary and 3 secondary burials. In addition, a pit was discovered in the SW area of the chamber just W of the stomion; this contained 4 or 5 secondary burials. The bones in this pit were better preserved, and included 2 adults and 2 or 3 sub-adults or children. The ceramic vessels in the chamber were associated with the burials outside of the pit, and can be preliminarily dated from LHIIIA2 to LHIIIB2. They include stirrup jars, jugs, an alabastron and a flask dated to LHIIIB1. Organic residue analysis is in process, as is phytolith analysis from soil samples taken from the dromos, stomion and chamber. Tomb 6 is similar to the other tombs discovered in this cemetery, which are very modest in terms of the wealth contained. The cemetery was most heavily used in LHIIIA2 and LHIIIB1, with some evidence for early activity in LHIIIA1, and it continued in use on a lesser scale into LHIIIB2. The cemetery was probably associated with the nearby settlement at Tsoungiza, and contained family tombs reused over generations. In tomb 6, the importance of continuity is emphasized by the fact that those who conducted burials here felt it important to reconstruct a tomb that had collapsed during its period of use. Kleonai. T. Mattern (DAI/Marburg) and K. Kissas (Director, 37th EPCA) report on a collaborative pilot project to produce an inventory of remains in the immediate surroundings of the anc. city, through a combination of field survey of the area immediately to the S, recording of previously known sites and analysis of EPCA records. An initial overview of this evidence will be of value in its own right, as well as a tool to assist in coordinating the protection of archaeological monuments. Results include the identification of anc. roadways in the immediate vicinity of the city, some flanked by funerary monuments. Several extramural sanctuaries were located; they probably include Khan Kourtesa, S of the city, the location of a spring, a mod. church and several members of a monumental Doric structure, including part of a geison. Together with earlier discoveries of grave material in the immediate vicinity of the Khan, this suggests a locus of settlement here. To the NE of the Temple of Herakles, several architectural members may suggest a further extramural sanctuary, and S of the city wall there is evidence of dispersed settlement. ARGOLID (4,h EPCA: 5th EBA) Lerna. M.H. Weincke (ASCSA) reports on a further study season. Further to the ongoing studies and publications reported in 2007 (AR 54 [2007-2008], 25), C14 analysis of 10 bone samples from the fills of the shaft graves is underway and conservation of the metal objects in the Lerna storeroom has begun. A conservation plan for the walls of the House of the Tiles is being developed and study for a revised site display in Argos Museum has been undertaken: the first phase comprises the creation of a digital plan of Lerna. Argos, Aspis. G. Touchais (EfA/Paris 1) and A. Philippa Touchais (EfA) report on the 2008 campaign. The MH walls of the central area of house O were consoli dated and cleaning was undertaken in various parts of the site (Fig. 23). Preliminary study of the pottery and human bone remains recovered from the 2007 cleaning in the area of Vollgraff's excavation shows that the 3 skeletons uncovered belong to a (probably male) adolescent 16/17 years old, a newborn baby suffering from congenital anaemia and an 8/9-year-old child. At the request of the 4th EPCA and the municipality of Argos, a project was developed to assess the Cl-Hel remains on the hill of Profitis Ilias, the Myc cemetery on the Deiras and the Sanctuary of Apollo Deiradiotis, with a view to creating an archaeological park for the better protection and display of the antiquities and to enhance the environment of the city of Argos. 23. Argos, Aspis: SE sector after landscaping.</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 19 Argos, Nannopoulos plot. A. Pariente (EfA/Lyon) and C. Piteros (4th EPCA) report on the 6th excavation campaign in this area, focused on the structures of the agora. Thirty six further tombs were excavated, mostly dug into the fill associated with the general abandonment of the anc. agora. Twenty held the remains of adults, 12 the remains of children and 2 those of babies. Two had primary burials plus the remains of a secondary burial, and one grave contained the double burial of an adult and a child (Fig. 24). All were pit graves possibly covered with planks of wood. In the almost complete absence of grave goods, the burials could not be dated; the exception is a double burial where a tpq is provided by the fact that the bottom of the pit rests on what is probably a By road. Excavation of the E part of the monumental exedra continued. Of particular interest is the junction between the foundation still in place and the collapsed remains of the seating, buried in fill in which the latest items date to the 6th and 7th Cts AD (Fig. 25). This impressive collection of blocks from the lowest level of the exedra resulted from sudden and uniform collapse, as indicated by the marked angle of the edges of the disturbance. In total, 12 blocks have been revealed from 3 foundations for the seating (limestone foundations, interior and exterior steps placed side by side, and a limestone bench) lying in the same relative order which they occupied within the structure itself. The causes of this massive collapse remain to be investigated. The fact that the blocks are intact indicates that the lowest level of the exedra had suffered no previous destruction before this collapse. Mycenae. S. Iakovides (ASA) reports {Ergon [2008], 35-45) continued excavation on the acropolis, in the lower city and in the area of Petsas House. On the acropolis, excavation of building was completed (Fig. 26). The oblong building had on the E side 3 rooms at ground level and a staircase: a courtyard at the edge of the complex is delimited by the Cyclopean wall. To the W of the rooms is an inclined passageway with an earthen surface, which leads into the courtyard. The rooms date to the 13th Ct BC and were built using materials from earlier structures. They remained in use for quite a short period and were destroyed ca. 1200 BC. The 2008 excavation was limited to the area of the inclined passageway, over which were 4 dressed blocks with square and round sockets for connection with other blocks, as well as a round structure built of unworked stones, associated with a few sherds and bones. The LHIIIB2 destruction level, which bore traces of fire, contained sherds, tile fragments, animal bone and many small finds (mainly fragments of wall-painting, figurines, beads, stone grinders, obsidian blades and flakes, lead and iron objects, loomweights, strainers and spools). Among these finds were a half-worked sealstone with no decoration and a clay sealing baked in the fire which destroyed the building. It bears a depiction which can with difficulty be read as the Linear ideogram for oil. Excavation continued in the lower city (Fig. 27). As in 2007, the topmost level dated to the Hel period: in the NW square, an apsidal building and remains of a potter's workshop were found. There may have been a kiln here. Immediately S of the apsidal building was the external wall of a large building, and beneath it an orthogonal cist tomb with the skeleton of a mature individual, probably female, accompanied by 5 Geo vessels, a pin and an iron ring, all dating to the 9th Ct BC (Fig. 28). In the SE sector lay an apsidal building of which the 2 end walls were preserved along with the interior cross walls. The building appears to be Myc and is partially covered by Hel remains and part of a cobbled road. 24. Argos, Nannopoulos plot: double burial. 25. Argos, Nannopoulos plot: collapsed seating in the exedra. Various small finds were discovered, including obsidian, fragments of wall-painting, pigments, animal bones, sherds, metal objects and coins, which date to the Myc, Geo and Hel periods. The remains of historical periods are separated from those of the Myc period by a thick level of reddish-brown earth washed down from the slopes of the surrounding hills and from Mt Sara, which dominates the site of Mycenae. At the so-called Petsas House, examination of area was completed in 2008. On its floor, which was strewn with earth and sherds, were traces of fire and burnt bricks from the super</page><page sequence="20">20 CATHERINE MORGAN 26.

The S and walls of the room were not found, and it is suggested that the room was unroofed. Area 10 was partially investigated in 2007, with work completed in 2008. Neither the S wall nor a normal floor were found. It was filled with destruction debris, with a layer of fire debris on the bedrock. Among finds from this fill are figurine fragments and sherds of at least 6 LHIIIA2 stirrup jars similar to those found in 1950 in room A. In room T, 2 rectangular sandstone bases each had a rectangular cutting in the centre and other smaller cuttings around (Fig. 29) to accommodate wooden supports either for the roof or for an upper floor. In 2007, part of a carbonized beam was discovered in the part of the room: in the S part are fragments of wall painting. Finds from room provide important information about the upper floor, which was decorated. Pithoi indicate organized storage of the commodities necessary to maintain a large household and workshops. It appears that the space was used for the manufacture, or at least the storage, of vessels and figurines. The pottery confirms that the area was destroyed towards the end of LHIIIA2. In 2007, the bases of 6 pithoi were found in Room Y, in situ on stone slabs sitting in small stones and mud. In 2008, 4 further bases were found, plus one slab without a base. Thus the room contained at least 11 pithoi. Hundreds of sherds were found in the course of the 2008 excavations in the Petsas House, plus 17 complete or restored vessels, and an abundance of small finds, mainly fragments of wall-painting. Figurine fragments were also found, as well as 2 sealstones, a piece of repouss?e gold leaf, fragments of ivory and objects of stone and glass paste. Publication: D. Danielidou, A a a II. To ?e a ?

The Gr-Swedish excavations on the Myc acropolis of Midea continued in 2008 under the direction of K. Demakopoulou (Director Emerita, National Museum) with the collaboration of A.-L. Schallin (Director, Swedish Institute) and N. Divari-Valakou (3rd EPCA). The Gr team excavated in the SW part of the lower acropolis and the Swedish team in the area E of the east gate. The Gr team worked on the lower W terrace of the acropolis, continuing the investigation of the gallery discovered in 2007 through the thickness of the W section of the fortification wall. The entrance of the gallery in the inner face of the wall, as well as the area in front of it, were further cleared. The entrance is flanked by wall 3 and a megalithic construction. Bedrock was revealed in a large part of this area, sloping down towards the entrance to the gallery, which was accessed via steps. The interior of the gallery was investigated to a /. of ca. 3.5m with the removal of a deposit about 0.9m d, which almost reached the roof. The gallery is an underground passageway or syrinx through the fortification wall, which at this point is 5.7m thick. Its side walls are built of boulders and curve slightly inward towards the top, while the ceiling is mostly made of horizontal stone slabs (Fig. 30). The floor, of levelled bedrock, has a slight inclination with low steps at several points. The syrinx, which is 1.4m h. and 0.6m w., runs straight through the wall to the investigated length of 3.5m. At this point it seems to turn to the and consequently to run obliquely to emerge at an exit. In order to find the exit of the syrinx, the excavation was extended outside the fortification wall. 30. Midea: interior of the gallery through the W section of the fortification wall.</page><page sequence="23">archaeology in greece 2008-2009 23 A large part of the outer face of the wall was exposed for a /. of 10m and a h. of 2.8m maximum. The wall, founded directly on bedrock, is very well preserved, built of boulders and large and medium-sized stones. The exit of the syrinx was located about 3.5m of the axis of the entrance in the other side of the wall. It was found blocked with medium-sized and small stones, apparently by the Mycenaeans themselves. Although the exit is blocked, its corbel-vault construction is clear. The side walls of the opening curve to form a corbel arch. The dimensions of the exit, 0.6-0.8m w. and lm /?., are consistent with a secret sally port, rather than a tunnel leading down to an underground cistern. The excavated part of the syrinx contained a fill of dark stony soil. Abundant LHIIIB2 sherds were recovered. A few LHIIIC E sherds indicate that the entrance remained open in the first half of the 12th Ct BC, although the syrinx was no longer in use. Four sherds joined the LHIIIC E krater recon structed from fragments found in the upper layers of trench C during the 2006 and 2007 excavations (Fig. 31). Part of the lower body of a Group A deep bowl decorated with antithetic spirals may be dated to LHIIIB2 L or LHIIIC E. The LHIIIB2 pottery includes mainly deep bowls of Groups A and B, stemmed bowls, cups and bowls, as well as jugs and stirrup jars. There are 2 sherds with pictorial motifs, one with a bull protome. The commonest fine plainware shapes are kylikes and dippers. There are many fragments of coarse storage and cooking vessels, such as pithoi, vats and a bowl. Fragments of large bowls of Handmade Burnished Ware and some small EMyc (LHIIA-B) sherds were recovered. Also found were some fragmentary clay human and animal figurines, notably the body of a bovid decorated with rock pattern. The other small finds from the interior of the syrinx include fragments of stone tools, such as millstones and pounders, bronze scraps including a small rivet from a knife or dagger, pieces of fluorite, mother-of-pearl and ochre, sea shells, as well as a small fragment of painted plaster. The deposits removed from the area adjacent to the outer face of the fortification wall contained a large quantity of mixed and worn sherds. These mostly date to LHIIIB2 with a few LHIIIC E and PGeo sherds. There are also many MH and EMyc sherds, as well as pottery of the LRom and Byz periods. The LHIIIB2 pottery recovered from this area includes a small stirrup jar now partly restored. Also noteworthy is a large part of a stone tripod mortar. The deposit below the floor of room I was also examined: according to the pottery found in 2007, this dates to LHIIIC E. A trench adjacent to the inner face of the fortification wall was excavated to a d. of 0.8m. The deposit removed was clearly a debris layer containing many stones fallen from the fortification wall. The fragmentary pottery from this layer is dated to LHIIIB2 L. This supports the conclusion that room I was constructed above the destruction debris caused by the earthquake that struck Midea at the end of the 13th Ct BC. The pottery from the debris layer contained many fragments of deep bowls of Groups A and B, of a small bowl with an internal pattern in added white paint, of jugs and of a miniature handmade vase. Other finds include a fragmentary clay human figurine, 2 steatite spindle-whorls and pieces of mother-of pearl. Work continued on the conservation of ceramics from previous seasons. Huge pithoi, restored from fragments, provide evidence for the storage of agricultural products inside the acropolis. In furtherance of the project to conserve the acropolis, with the maintenance and arrangement of the and SW part of the site, a photographic survey was made of the section of the fortification wall in this area. 31. Midea: LHIIIC E krater from the gallery, trench C. The work of the Swedish team concentrated on the upper plateau, SE of the east gate. Two areas E of the east gate were investigated: trench 12 and the baulk between trenches 3 and 9 (see AR 54 [2007-2008], 30 for work in these trenches from 2004 onwards). Trench 12 is situated next to trench 3, along the inner face of the citadel wall, where a row of buildings was previously unearthed. The outline of the structure within the citadel wall was revealed. The first wall encountered, along the S scarp, is the continuation of that found in trench 3; it stretches towards the E and forms a right-angled corner with the other wall. The latter wall, running towards the citadel wall, is preserved to a lower level. The complete perimeter of the room partly excavated in trench 3 is now exposed. Finds comprise a majority of LH finewares and coarsewares, Myc figurine fragments, a bronze pin and 3 obsidian arrowheads. Green glazed sherds found in a pit provide evidence of Med activity. Work was resumed between trenches 9 and 3 to clarify the architectural layout of rooms encircling the citadel wall. Most of the NW part of this baulk had been excavated down to bedrock in 2007. Work in 2008 provided evidence for a wall running E-W, which rested on bedrock and was preserved to a h. of 3 courses. The whole E part of the baulk was excavated down to bedrock. The dark brown soil (layer 2) contained pottery, bones and an obsidian arrowhead. Close to the bedrock in the SE corner of this part of the baulk, a cylinder seal of black stone was found, depicting quadrupeds and chevron filling motifs (Fig. 32). The seal most probably belongs to the LMyc Mainland Popular Group. 32. Midea: LMyc cylinder seal from the baulk between trenches 3 and 9, E of the E gate.</page><page sequence="24">24 CATHERINE MORGAN Publication: G. Walberg, Midea: the Megaron Complex and Shrine Area. Excavations on the Lower Terraces 1994-1997 (Philadelphia, INSTAP 2007). Tiryns. J. Maran (DAI/Heidelberg) reports on the 3rd season of excavation in the W lower town. Investigation of grid squares L51 and L52 focused on the hitherto little-known occupation of the site during the pre-Myc, EMyc and EPalatial (LHIIIA) periods, as well as during the EIA. Although Pre-Myc and EMyc levels have not yet been reached, the basic course of occupation is reflected in finds appearing as earlier admixtures in later levels. Another EH sealing supplements the group of such objects already known from 2007. An unusual object of likely MBA date is a steatite stamp seal, the form and decoration of which has close parallels in Minoan seals of MMII-III date (Fig. 33). The earliest confirmed architectural remains date to LHIIIA2 and belong to a building distinguished by its relatively large size and massive wall, resembling the LHIIIA building complexes uncovered between 1969 and 1974 in the zone immediately S of the current excavation. Until now, only a segment of the S exterior wall of this new building and parts of 2 rooms with associated floors have been exposed. In refuse deposits, which had accumulated above the former ground surface in an open area outside the building, a 0.037m /. fragment of a Linear tablet of very fine clay was found (Fig. 34). Only a short segment of one original straight edge of the tablet is preserved, whereas on all other sides the piece is broken and heavily worn. The surface shows 3 parallel lines and traces of a 4th, as well as one partially preserved sign. Although the size of the object and its bad state of preservation render it useless as a textual source, its significance lies in the fact that it comes from a chronologically homogenous context, and it is the earliest example of such a tablet in Tiryns. Still within the sub-phase LHIIIA2, the above building was replaced by the room uncovered in 2007 and interpreted as a potter's workshop. The walls of this latest attested Myc building phase were not founded on top of those of its predecessor and were built in a different technique. It is now clear that the room, which yielded most of the unusual objects, plus installations thought to be linked to pottery production, was not a roofed space, but rather a courtyard associated with a building outside the S boundary of the excavation area. It is likely that most of the examples of painted plaster found in 2007 and 2008 had decorated the walls of this building. A Myc sealing with an unclear impression probably predates the use of the courtyard, as it came to light inside the fabric of its floor. The ceramic evidence confirmed last year's assessment of only a minor overlap of the latest Myc building phase with LHIIIB1 and a subsequent abandonment of the area during most of LHIIIB and LHIIIC. The most significant EIA discovery is a structure interpreted as a Geo burial precinct, only partly situated inside the excavation area (Fig. 35). To the the precinct was enclosed by a reused earlier terrace wall probably of Myc date, and to the W by a row of at least 3 large stone blocks. Cut into the boundary wall and arranged at an approximate right angle to it, a Geo amphora lay obliquely on its belly, with its mouth toward the interior of the enclosed space. Parts of another large vessel found at its mouth probably served as a cover. Along the W side of the amphora, 2 small vessels, an undecorated trefoil mouthed jug and a decorated skyphos, were found standing in an upright position. Linked to the deposition of the amphora is a pavement of broken limestone slabs which followed the inner side of the boundary wall and curved in a bow outwards in front of the mouth of the amphora. The amphora was removed en bloc to allow investigation of the contents. In light of these discoveries, the possibility arises that the pavement of large limestone slabs uncovered in 2006, and first interpreted as the covering of a cist grave, served as an access to the burial precinct. In such a case we would be dealing with a very elaborate construction. A remarkable stray find from an EIA level is a golden spacer bead (0.0085m /.) consisting of 4 thin tubes of which the 2 in the middle are slightly shorter than the ones on the outside (Fig. 36). This is likely to come from a disturbed rich grave of the Geo period. In grid square L51, the uppermost part of a curved structure built with small stones began to. appear. This possibly represents a PGeo house. Restoration and analysis of the large complex of wall paintings found between 1999 and 2001 in excavations 3cm 33.

Franchthi Cave. K.D. Vitelli (ASCSA) reports on continuing study and analytical programmes. Study of the Pal and Mes ornaments was completed, focusing on those made from Columbella rustica. Study of the Neo material was begun, revealing abundant shell ornaments which change the overall picture of Neo ornaments. The Initial Neo and ENeo are dominated by Columbella and Cyclope beads, which establish an element of continuity with the Mes. In parallel, more 'typical' Neo ornaments, i.e. geometric beads and pendants, appear as early as the Initial Neo. The rate of change, both in terms of the composition of the ornaments and the techniques of production, is considerably higher in the Neo than the Pal and Mes periods. Faunal analysis continued to focus on trench Hl-B: analysis of material from periods 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2, 3 and 4 is now complete. Taxonomic abundance at Franchthi Cave is unusual in several respects, and provides important information about the anc. environment and subsistence. First, in all periods except period 2, small game taxa (birds, small mammals and reptiles) outnumber ungulates in absolute abundance. In period 2, the numbers of ungulate and small game specimens are more or less equal. Although small game have been shown to be an important part of LPal economies, at Franchthi they are interesting for their early appearance, their consistency across the sequence and their sheer numbers. Despite relative stability in the representation of small game versus ungulate taxa, there is substantial taxonomic change within the small game and ungulate categories themselves. In the early part of the sequence, wild ass (Equus hydrantinus) dominates the ungulate assemblage. However, red deer (Cervus elaphus) steadily increase in number until they surpass the equids in period 3. Wild boar (Sus scrofa), wild goat (Capra aegagrus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) never play more than distinctly secondary roles. The small game assemblage is comprised primarily of hare (Lepus europaeus) and birds (namely partridge and pigeon). The exception is a pronounced peak in period 3, when fish (primarily gilthead sea bream; Sparus aurata) become the most common taxonomic group in the assemblage. This peak is all the more pronounced given that fish are virtually absent from the sequence until period 2 when they comprise less than 15% of small game taxa. They return to this same low frequency in period 4.</page><page sequence="26">26 CATHERINE MORGAN ARCADIA (39th EPCA: 5th EBA) Y. Pikoulas (ed.), E A A A A A A A.

The stele bears an epigram, and lists 22 names of the dead of the tribe Erechtheis. Agia Paraskevi Arachamitai. B. Fors?n (Finnish Institute) reports on work conducted in 2008. Further trial trenches were opened around the large courtyard structure and Hei stoa (AR 54 [2007-2008], 32), in order to define the date and function of the courtyard structure, to gain information about the relationship between these buildings, which are differently aligned and thus perhaps of different date, and to obtain data on the pre-Hel activities currently known only through the few finds made in 2007. The plan of the monumental courtyard structure obtained from the 2007 magnetometer survey (Fig. 37) shows a series of 5m 6m rooms around all sides of the courtyard. The survey suggested the presence of a round pit in the centre of the court, and 2 entrances in the middle of the E and W sides respectively. A trial trench (E) at the location of the possible central pit produced insufficient information to confirm the existence of a man-made feature here. A 2nd trial (F) revealed the exact location of 3 of the walls of one of the rooms flanking the courtyard. These walls are built of small unworked stones with no mortar, are ca. 0.6m w. and stand ca. 0.6-0.7m h. beneath ca. 0.2m of top soil. The room interior was covered by a 0.1-0.2m d. layer of roof tile mixed with a burned mass of red clay, possibly the remains of sun-dried bricks from the upper part of the walls. Very few finds were recorded in the layer below the collapsed roof - only some iron nails and a few non-diagnostic sherds mixed with charcoal and ash - and so the date and function of the courtyard structure remain unresolved. However, many of the roof tiles were decorated with finger strokes in the typical MRom or LRom manner, thus giving an approximate indication of date which is further supported by a C14 sample taken below the collapsed roof, which gives a date of the 3r or 4th Ct AD. A further objective of 2008 was to determine the borders of the shallow pit filled with dark soil, large quantities of pottery and other small finds revealed in 2007. The 2007 trench (A) was extended to the S and W, revealing across its area a 0.3 0.5m d. dark layer mixed with fragments of roof tiles, large amounts of pottery (including miniature vessels), fragmentary terracotta figurines, various small finds, charcoal and ash. The layer is thicker and slightly deeper in the towards the stoa like structure. Sterile soil lay below this dark layer except in a small area in the of the trench, where more dark soil mixed with large quantities of pottery, various small finds and ash continues at least to 1.7m below surface. This dark soil, most likely from a pit, differs in that it contains some large stones instead of fragmentary roof tiles. The earliest finds, made in the S part of the trench, include parts of a M5th Ct local rf vase and bg pottery of the 4th-3rd Ct BC. Most finds date to the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC, and include Megarian bowls and bronze coins. Several coins were found in the pit, including one of Kassandros, recovered at a d. of 1.55m. The composition of the finds is thus rather similar to that presented in the 2007 excavations, although with more evidence for the early phases of cult activity as well as providing a better picture of the stratigraphy of the dark soil layer.

Petropoulos (39th EPCA), M.E. Voyatzis (ASCSA/Arizona) and D.G Romano (ASCSA/Pennsylvania) report on the 2008 season of excavation and survey (Figs 38, 39). Excavation revealed stratigraphie sequences which probably indicate a first use of the altar in the Myc period, characterized by dozens of Myc kylikes and other small finds. Above this lowest level, the stratigraphy includes EIA material, as well as Geo, Ar, Cl and Hel pottery and other objects apparently in a continuous sequence. Many miniature bronze tripods were recovered, as well as silver coins, metal objects and miniature dedications of various kinds. Numerous EH and MH sherds, as well as large amounts of FNeo, were uncovered again this year in nearly all layers of the altar. Masses of animal bones continue to be unearthed, but no human bones have yet been found. Part of what may be the anc. t?menos wall was cleared S of the altar. In the lower sanctuary, excavation continued immediately and S of the seats or steps and outside the NE corner of the xenon, where considerable amounts of Hel pottery were found. More of the 67m /. stoa building was cleared: a trench was opened to the of the stoa to recover information from a stele that had been illicitly uncovered. Work continued to document the location of all extant stone blocks. Architectural study focused on completion of the docu mentation of the steps or seats to the of the stoa, the E wall of the xenon and the fountain house to the S and W of the xenon. G.

A monumental limestone grave stele (more than 4.5m h. and undecorated), preserved in 4 sections, has long been known from the site. It is best</page><page sequence="28">28 CATHERINE MORGAN paralleled in LCI Attica. In the S part of the cemetery, in addition to common graves, excavation to date has revealed the following monuments along the line of the road. A rectangular structure (2.3m Im), of which the foundations are preserved: this is built of small and medium sized worked limestone and local stone blocks, preserved in 2 courses to a total h. of 0.7m. No evidence for the superstruc ture survives. An empty elliptical pit was found behind and below the level of the foundations. The foundations of a funerary monument (2.6m 1.3m), preserving part of the euthynteria of limestone blocks (notably the well-worked NE corner block, 1.1m /., 0.6m w. and 0.29m h., plus a further smaller such block, 0.81m 0.41m 0.27m). The lower faces of these blocks, which sat on bedrock, were only roughly worked, and the spaces between the blocks were packed with smaller stones. This may be the foundation of the large stele long known from this site, or a similar such marker. A cavity 1.1m 1.3m was cut into the bedrock inside the structure and below its foundations: this was empty, but had likely been looted. Surface cleaning above this monument produced a bronze coin of Heraia of 370-340 BC. An elliptical pit (0.4m 0.85m and 0.4m c/.), cut into the bedrock, contained 5 bg vessels (an oinochoe, a krater, 2 skyphoi and a kantharos) of the L4th-E3rd Ct BC, carefully placed together. These may relate to rituals in memory of the dead. The pit was then covered with limestone slabs. A further 4 LCl-EHel vessels (a krater, 2 skyphoi and a trefoil-mouthed oinochoe) were found in a similar pit, 5m to the S of the stele monument detailed above. Finally, following reports of tombs on the W slope of Skeplia, ca. 80m NW of the stele monument, 4 tombs were discovered, of which 2 have so far been excavated. Tomb 1 is a pit grave 1.15m 0.35m, in which only the lower part of the skeleton was preserved; among the bones was a tear bottle and, by the right tibia, a lamp, finds which date the tomb to the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC. A tomb excavated to the W of the road dates to the end of the 2nd Ct BC on the basis of the grave offerings (a tear bottle and a lamp). Tomb 4 is a cist, 2m 0.5m, which contained an extended skeleton, head to the N, but no grave goods. While the anc. road has eroded away in the area of the major monuments, sections of it were found to the E of these graves. The road here is 2.76m w., preserved for a /. of 6.5m and is built of pieces of the local soft bedrock, unworked slab-like stones and pot sherds. Cleaning of this general area revealed a further 11m /. stretch running N: the road surface was not preserved here, merely the cutting for the road bed (2.55m w.) and the lower levels of fill consisting of chips from the quarrying of the bedrock. Kakouraiika (Heraia). A.-V. Karapanagiotou (39th EPCA) is cited (E. Salavoura, Istories, 79) as reporting the discovery of 2 further Myc chamber-tomb cemeteries in the region of this village, along the E bank of the Alpheios river, close to the cemetery at Loutra Heraias reported in AR 53 (2007-2008), 33. Andriopoulo (Agios Andreas). In a general review of EByz remains from Arcadia, most of which have been previously reported, E.

It is characterized as a probable farmstead. Lousoi. G. Ladst?tter (Austrian Institute) reports on the 2008 excavation season, concentrated on the area of the Hel peripteral temple and the cult complex just W of it (see AR 54 [2007-2008], 33-34). On terrace 1, a small Hel cult structure (5.7m 8.1m) associated with an altar has been studied since 2004. Underneath this so-called orthostat building lay the foundations of a further rectangular building (5m 7m) of the LCI period; associated finds indicate a cult use. Probably in the E Imperial Rom period, the orthostat building was enlarged with the addition of 2 rooms to the and S. Excavation in 2008 concen trated on the NE of the orthostat building and on the hall of the enlarged phase. The architectural remains of the altar (1.3m 2.6m) were uncovered completely. The altar is located 2.7m E of the orthostat building and symmetrically aligned with it. The bad state of preservation of this structure results from recent disturbance. Two further architectural members that can, by their measurements, be ascribed to the altar lay in recent fills in its immediate vicinity. The area of the altar yielded severely fragmented finds dating from the Cl period to the E2nd Ct BC, similarly to the adjacent cult structures. A deep sounding in the hall of the orthostat building led to the discovery of stratified Geo material for the first time in this area: at some distance below the lower edge of the Hel foundations lay very small pottery fragments, several sherds of a cooking pot and of a large hydria; for both vessels, 8th Ct BC dates are proposed. The Hel peripteral temple (15.8m 42.35m) had a peristasis of 6 15 columns in its initial phase. From E-W, the sekos consists of a pronaos, a succession of 2 large halls with internal supports and an adyton, inaccessible from the W. The 2008 excavations concentrated in the W hall of the sekos and the colonnade. In both areas, deep soundings aimed to verify the 2007 results from the E hall of the sekos concerning the pre-Hel use of the area. It soon became clear that the 6 limestone slabs that once held supports subdividing the W hall into 3 aisles were part of the original building phase: in a situation similar to that in the E hall, the slabs rest on foundations of multiple layers of limestone blocks. Further, these foundations cut deeply into the virtually sterile layer of green clay that was placed here to provide stable support for the monumental Hel structure. The deep sounding in the colonnade produced the following stratigraphie sequence: underneath the clay packing into which the Hel foundations had been lowered, there is a lm d. sequence of fills, consisting entirely of secondary deposits of Geo pottery. Under these fills (ca. 1.6m beneath the foundation of the sekos wall) was a primary stratum containing 2 well preserved cooking pots. Placed carefully in the 2 vessels were a cup and a small jug. Based on their shape, and especially on the characteristic hatched triangles on the shoulder of the jug, this eating/drinking assemblage can be dated to the Geo period (Fig. 40). 40. Lousoi: Geo pottery from a primary deposit beneath the colonnade of the Hel peripteral temple.</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 29 41. Lousoi: Geo wall beneath the Hel peripteral temple. In the sounding in the W sekos hall, excavation underneath the sterile clay packing supporting the Hel temple revealed a curved stone setting built of broken-up local flysch and a few pebbles (Fig. 41). Based on its elevation, building technique and stratigraphie context, this wall can be associated with stone settings recognized in the E sekos hall during the 2007 campaign: in combination they can be reconstructed as an apsidal structure 4.5m w. at least 7m /. This will have to be further verified in future excavations. The deposit of earth within the suggested apse contained fragments of a jug with typical Geo band decoration. Based on the information currently available, the structure dates to the Geo period and is associated with the deep primary deposits under the peristasis. Although excavations in the area of the Hel urban centre of Lousoi revealed only occasional evidence for earlier activities, this area also appears to have been in use during the Geo period. Finds so far indicate occasional activities, including eating and drinking (feasting), perhaps with a cult background and probably associated with some simple architecture. These preliminary results suggest that at the bottom of the Soudena plain lay a further Geo settlement or cult place, complementing the Sanctuary of Artemis about 1km to the NE, which can also be traced back to the 8th Ct BC. It is further striking that in both cases there is evidence for elaborate rebuilding of the cult structures in the Hel period. LACONIA (5th EPCA: 5th EBA) W. Cavanagh, C. Gallou and M. Georgiadis (eds), Sparta and Laconia from Prehistory to Premodern (London, BSA 2009) offers an invaluable overview of the region.

Poupaki (Athens) present an overview of ongoing research into the main quarry locations in Laconia (Sparta and Laconia, 169-79). Quarry sites briefly noted are: Gynaika, Platyvouni (Sochas), Vresthena, Chrysafa, Viglafia (Rom-ECh), Daimonia, Ag. Marina, Zarakas and Tainaro. Fuller discussion is offered of Oitylo (including Rom-ECh cuttings) and especially Plytra (anc.

Sparta E. Zavvou and A. Themos (Epigraphical Museum, formerly 5th EPCA) present (Sparta and Laconia, 105-22) a synthesis of the results of rescue excavations conducted in the mod. city from 1994-2005, analysing their impact on our understanding of urban development from EH-ECh times. Significant changes to the existing picture are provided, for example by the presence of EH activity on the SW edge of the city, and the extent of PGeo and Geo activity especially in the area of Limnai, S of the acropolis, and at the W edge of the city. Sparta Theatre. C Morgan (Director, BSA), A. Vasilogamvrou (Director, 5th EPCA) and K. Diamanti (Director, 5U EBA) report on the first season of excavation in the anc. theatre, focusing on investigation of the extent and nature of LRom and Byz use of the space, and combining new excavation with reappraisal of BSA work in the 1920s. Excavation was conducted in the W part of the middle and upper cavea in order to locate the SW edge of the LAntique settlement on the acropolis and to establish the limits of the housing on the W side of the orchestra, partially excavated in the 1990s (Fig. 42). Attention focused on Byz landscaping between the main settlement areas. S of the lower retaining wall of the cavea, a substantial M Byz (12th Ct) terrace wall prevented erosion of the upper slope and hill-wash onto structures downslope. This contains a quantity of architectural spolia from the theatre. In the easternmost of the upper cavea trenches, abutting the cavea retaining wall, one of the radial paths which linked the 2 settlement areas was revealed, containing MByz pottery. In the westernmost of the upper trenches, an anomaly revealed in the 2007 resistivity survey was found to be a mass grave of the MByz period (Fig. 43). A large pit cut into the clay fill of the theatre housed a 2.5m 2m structure of uncoursed cobbles, with walls, containing architectural spolia, which were well faced and plastered only on the interior. A composite lotus and acanthus capital reused within the lower wall probably originated in the upper part of the theatre (Fig. 44). To the and W, the construction pit was backfilled with domestic refuse, including EByz-MByz cooking and table wares, and a quantity of severely burnt roof tile of Rom type, debris of a major fire nearby. It remains unclear whether the structure was entered from the side or from the top, and there is no evidence to show how it was covered. The chamber contained the remains of more than 22 individuals; preliminary analysis suggests both male and female, mostly adults of a wide age range, but with a few sub-adults and at least one child of 8-10 years. These remains were deposited in 4 episodes featuring very different practices. The lowest level contained an ossuary-like arrangement of crania against the wall with long bones together to the S (Fig. 45). Subsequently, a low interior wall or bench was added on the W side of the chamber and a quantity of human bone was packed behind it. Over this was an inhumation which had been heavily truncated. And finally, a large deposit of mixed semi-articulated bone with badly broken bone overlaid it.</page><page sequence="30">30 CATHERINE MORGAN 42. Sparta theatre: 2008 excavation plan. 43.

It seems that the structure was initially intended as an ossuary but was rapidly reused as a tomb. All 4 episodes took place within the 12,h-E13th Ct and were probably mostly reburials of remains originally deposited on the acropolis. There is as yet no evidence for a religious building in this area, but these unusual circumstances have a possible parallel in a multiple burial excavated in 1926 S of the theatre. Debris from the LRom and (mostly) Byz settlement on the acropolis was encountered in all the upper trenches; a little LRom pottery (3rd-6th Ct), tile and brick, EByz cookware (ca. 9th-E10th Ct) and MByz (mostly 12th Ct) amphorae and tableware confirm the chronology of the main settlement phases. A distinctive group of EByz cookpots was isolated, the earliest of which, manufactured on a slow wheel and hand finished, is tentatively dated in the L8th or 9th Ct. All trenches produced pottery and votives washed down from the Sanctuary of Athena Chalkioikos on the acropolis. Of particular interest are 2 fragments of an Ar terracotta antefix and a partially preserved stone jumping weight of the L6th-E5th Ct BC with an unusually long inscription (Fig. 46). The name of the Spartan who dedicated the weight is not preserved, and was probably on a second halter, but a victory at the Olympic Games can be restored, the athlete offering up his sporting equipment to the goddess on his return home. Sparta, SW cemetery. A. Themos, A. Maltezou, G. Pantou, G. Tsiangouris and C. Phlouris (5th EPCA) report (Sparta and Laconia, 261-69) on the results of rescue excavations between 1994 and 2005 (especially on the Katsaris-Mavridis and the Dimitrakopoulos-Zachariadis plots) which have revealed more than 700 burials of LHel-5th Ct AD date. Preliminary discussion of tomb types, burials customs and offerings is presented. MByz remains in the city area are presented (Sparta and Laconia, 301-11) by A. Bakourou (formerly Director, 5th EBA), focusing on 2 adjacent building plots, O.T. 126 and 127, where a funerary chapel, a church, a bath and an olive press were discovered. The triconch funerary chapel was discovered on the Theodosopoulou-Karydi property in O.T 126. This is a simple, one-roomed structure, 12.4m total /. 6.1m w (narthex 9m h&gt;.). The structure included building material in secondary use (large orthogonal limestone blocks with smaller stone filling between them, plastered in), a technique mostly used in the 10th-llth Ct, although there is no evidence for earlier structures on the site. The interior was decorated with wall paintings; one fragment depicts an inscribed scroll. Evidence combines to indicate a date of the 2nd half of the 10th Ct AD. Inside the main chapel were 3 cist tombs (one in the S apse and 2 in the W aisle), with a further 6 in the narthex, below the floor and the marble threshold. This indicates that the chapel was funerary in its original conception, but burial continued after its destruction, from the 12th to the first half of the 13th Ct. Small rectangular enclosures were built to the W of it in this later period, probably to organize the large cemetery which then developed inside and around the building (26 cist tombs have been recovered, containing multiple burials, and 25 pit graves mostly of children). Grave goods included bracelets, rings, earrings, and many MByz buckles. From the fill across the area come examples of glazed pottery of the 12th and 13th Cts, with restorable vessels from funerary feasts within the cemetery. Thirty eight coins were found, 3 of the 10th Ct, most of the 11th to the first half of the 13th Ct, and 3 Fr coins of the Corinth mint of ca. 1250. 46. Sparta theatre: L6th-E5th Ct BC halter recording an Olympic victory. On the property of E. Rigos, just to the W in O.T. 127, are the foundations of a Byz church (preserved to lm h.), resting on the remains of a Rom structure. The building, which has an almost square plan, has 3 aisles with apses at the E end and a narthex at the W (the main entrance is in the W side of the narthex). There are traces of wall-painting in the central apse (and loose fragments found scattered elsewhere), as well as of marble cladding and a marble floor. The altar table was in situ. On the basis of the building itself, its sculpted decoration and the coins found (especially 2 anonymous folles), an 11th Ct construction date is indicated; there followed 3 or 4 building phases, and it is likely that the building continued in use into late Comninan times and that it was destroyed by an earthquake. A further rescue excavation on the property of S. and P. Androutsou, in addition to allowing complete exploration of the whole of the church, revealed MByz cist and pit graves along the entire E side of the building. A small distance to the E of the church lay the remains of a bath, preserving the apodyterion, caldarium and frigidarium. The central room had apses around, one of which served as a cistern. Remains of 2 water tanks were discovered outside the building. The hypocaust is poorly preserved, although the floors of the W niche and the 3rd room survive. The bath was a public rather than a private building, and is dated by the architecture to ca. 1100-1260. The olive press was discovered NE of the bath, on the Philippopoulou plot. The large collection basin was well preserved, with a large rotating trapetum, with the slot for the central wooden axle pole which, together with a horizontal beam, supported 2 millstones turned by animal power. A further press was found just to the N. This is the first well preserved workshop of this period found in Sparta, although partial traces of others (for example, on the Katsou property in O.T 125) are preserved within the mod. city and on the acropolis. Magoula. E. Kourinou (National Museum) and Y. Pikoulas (Thessaly) publish (Sparta and Laconia, 181-86) the remains of an anc. bridge over the Skatias river, on the WSW slopes of Magoula, which probably dates to the LCI or Hel period (L4th 3rd Ct BC).</page><page sequence="32">32 CATHERINE MORGAN Mistras. G. Marinou reports (AAA 39 [2006], 211-28) on new evidence for the architecture and form of the Laskaris house in the lower town, revealed in the course of cleaning and restoration work from 2002 onwards. Three building phases can be identified, and are described in detail. The original, possibly 13th Ct AD, building is a rectangular structure perpen dicular to the contours of the hill, with a small vaulted triclinium on the 1st floor (only traces of its 2nd storey are preserved), a ground floor space and a stoa to the N. The building was extended in the first half of the 14th Ct (possibly by Alexios Laskaris Metochitis, governor of the P?loponn?se), with the addition of a large triclinium supported on a 2-storeyed vaulted extension to the E and of the original house. This extension occupied the site of earlier buildings. Removal of Ot additions (a cross-wall in the triclinium, masonry sealing its windows etc.) revealed the triclinium floor, the original form of the windows and of the seat by their sills, and the form of the tympanum of the Byz arch on the E fa?ade beneath the triclinium (2 openings with semicircular arches, separated by a pillar). The portico is also seen to be a 2-storeyed arcade on the E fa?ade. The 3rd phase saw the addition of a special room with pointed door and window openings at the S of the triclinium. On the E fa?ade, the 2 large arches at the level beneath it were replaced by a wall with smaller pointed windows. The large arch on the ground floor beneath was also replaced. Parapets with corbels were installed on the balconies. A date of the 2nd half of the 14th Ct is proposed for this final phase, and the author suggests that the changes reflect the new taste for private rooms and westernizing features at the court of the Despot Manuel Kantakouzenos and his wife Isabelle de Lusignan.

The old excavation finds include much EHII and MH pottery, along with LHIIA-LHIIIC. A Myc burial discovered in 1970 on the property of V. Bourazelis in the area of Anthochori includes 2 LHIIA squat jugs. Sherds of Laconian PGeo skyphoi and closed vessels are also noted. Ar and Cl pottery and votives relate to the known sanctuary: fragments of 4 stamped tiles of the 3rd Ct BC preserve the stamp e a / a . Survey in 2004 showed that archaeological finds concentrate over a large area around the Church of the Metamorphosis, with material of the historical period (bg sherds, pithoi and black painted tiles) especially to the S, and that of PH periods (EH saucers, Myc kylikes, handmade wares) to the E. Ca. 100m W of the church, on the property of P. Fraghis, an underground circular chamber (1.7m h. and 2.38m di), with rectangular niches to the and S of the chamber and a short dromos, was probably a storeroom rather than a tomb: no dating evidence was found. Rescue excavation on the property of D. Katsoulakos, just to the of the church, revealed EH architec tural remains over an area of 183m2. In a lower layer, remains of successive building phases were revealed, with rectilinear houses showing successive additions and alterations. Construction was in stone in the herringbone technique, with a mud-brick superstructure and probably roofing in schist slabs. A large building was exposed in the NW sector of the excavation. Pottery from this lower layer dates early in EHII. Especially in the E sector of the excavation, the poor preserva tion of walls made it impossible to retrieve individual building plans. The pottery was mostly coarse or semi-coarse, with saucers, deep rounded bowls, basins, pithoi and open jars being the most popular shapes in coarser fabrics; finer wares sometimes have an (often high) polish and/or a red slip, and most finewares or semi-coarsewares have incised or impressed decoration. Stone finds (querns, a mortar, a palette and stone tools) are noted. MESSENIA (38th EPCA: 26th E A) Messene. P.

In the theatre area, excavation continued in the EByz cemetery reported in 2007, moving towards the Hel retaining wall of the E parodos. Seventeen cist graves were excavated, divided into 4 groups; these were built from the worked stones of the theatre, terracotta and stone slabs. The first group, of 5 tombs, included 4 found empty and one with the skeleton of a young woman without grave goods, Of the other groups, one had 3 tombs, the 2nd 7 and the 3rd 2 (Fig. 47). All were similar, contemporary constructions and contained bodies accompanied by pottery oinochoai, and dated to a later, EByz period. Particularly characteristic of these cemeteries is the per?bolos which encloses them in an ordered arrangement, their separation into unitary groups with the use of common partition walls in each row to economise on space and cost, and the fact that each group was likely used for a family. The overall appearance of the burials confirms that they were contemporary constructions. 47. Messene: groups of EByz cist tombs in the theatre area.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 33 In the course of the cemetery excavation, the retaining wall of the E parodos of the theatre was also fully revealed; the E end of this is now visible, where it turns in a right angle and continues to the S. The W retaining wall shows the same trait. The E wall is exceptionally well preserved. It is constructed in a variant of the isodomic system with tooling on the visible surfaces of the blocks and small infillings, and in one case deviation from the verticality of the jointing (Fig. 48). In the fill between the group of 5 graves and the retaining wall was found the head of a marble statue of a woman: the face is destroyed, with only the eyes preserved. The hairstyle copies that of statues of Faustina II. The head was a recutting of an older statue of a man, a practice attested by other sculptures of the 4th Ct AD made in a local workshop at Messene, such as the head of Hermes (Fig. 49) and that of the Emperor Constantine, which were both re?ut from statues of women of the Hel period. Excavation was resumed in the Sanctuary of Isis and Sarapis. The plan was clarified of an underground TT-shaped reservoir located S of the theatre and separated from it by a road (6m w.). The branch of the reservoir is 46.5m /. and the E and W 35.5m /. It is 3.25m w. and covered with an arched vault which has no openings for light. However, one high arched opening was located, approximately in the middle of the W branch, and 4 smaller ones in the branch. At the end of the 4th Ct AD, the reservoir, then apparently out of use and unroofed, served the inhabitants of Messene as a dump for refuse, sculpture included. AR 50 (2003-2004), 29 reported fragments of a statue of Perseus holding the head of Medusa and a seated statue of Isis nursing Horus. New fragments belonging to this group, from the body of Horus, were found in 2008 (Fig. 50). The right side of a head of a marble statue of a male figure of the 2nd Ct AD was also found, plus the life sized marble head of a lioness and pieces of many marble statues. These all probably come from the theatre and the Sanctuary of Isis, and are products of local workshops at Messene, mostly of the 2nd Ct AD. They were probably broken and deposited in the disused reservoir by fanatical Christians around the end of the 4th Ct AD. In the W branch of the reservoir were many fragments of mosaic pavements, as well as tesserae which probably came from the decoration of the Isis shrine. The function of the underground TT-shaped structure as a reservoir was clarified by the discovery of water channels in the upper part of the walls. The Sanctuary of Isis lay E of the reservoir, along with the remains of the basilica. On one of the architectural members of the basilica, in secondary use, was an inscription [-- e] $ (see PAE [2001], 82). 48. Messene: theatre, E parodos wall. 49.

Messene: bronze statue of Scylla-Medusa. The narthex of the basilica was completely uncovered, and one monolithic column from the S colonnade re-erected with its base and capital. Investigation outside the S nave revealed many Ch cist tombs. A capital from the base of a bronze statue was found in secondary use: an inscription in large letters reads A a . Also in secondary use, as a paving stone in the central nave, was a catalogue inscription a$ a a . In the stoa of the agora, stone blocks were re-erected and conservation undertaken of the 2 counters for withdrawing and measuring solids for the agoranomeion. On their undersides, these blocks preserved sockets and clamps for the suspension of the receptacles into which fell the solid goods being measured. The bronze head of Medusa previously reported (AR 54 [2007 2008], 38) was conserved, thus confirming its form with char acteristic deranged hair, crowning snakes and arresting gaze (Fig. 51).

Three hundred metres NW of the Sanctuary of Artemis, at a sanctuary investi gated in 1989 (AR 36 [1989-1990], 33; PAE [1989], 107-10), sections of column capital, epistyle and geison of the Ionic order were found.

Significant results are noted from trenches 1 and 2. In trench 1 (close to the top of the wall) there was a marked difference in findings between the and S parts of the trench. In the S was a vault, which had been partially removed in mod. times; on the top of it, roughly worked limestone blocks were placed between, but not joined to, the arch centre. Over this lay a compact greyish stratum with lenses of burning, within which were LCl-Hel sherds and a Cor coin of the E Imperial period. Trench 2 was placed at the foot of the curtain wall in order to confirm the relationship with the layers of fill present and the rock beneath. Over the entire area, a uniform stratum of rather soft clay lay directly upon the rock on which the wall was founded. In the northernmost area there emerged collapsed material which probably relates to the supports and wall super structure; underneath it, a stratum probably formed in mod. times consisted almost exclusively of pieces of brick. Pylos. J.L. Davis (Director, ASCSA) reports on a further study season. Examination of faunal remains and their archaeolog ical contexts has now been completed. Some 13,000 specimens, from the end of the EBA until the final destruction of the Palace of Nestor, have been studied; EMyc deposits are particularly well represented. Study of human remains and artefacts from graves is nearly finished. LHIIIA is the principal period of use of chamber tombs associated with the palace, although there were burials in several tombs in LHIIIC. Analysis of human remains from several chamber tombs at Kato Rouga, on the SW edge of Chora, was begun in collabo ration with the 38th EPCA. Analysis of pottery from the pantries continued; matching fingerprints are helping to identify the products of individual potters. Systematic study of floor-plaster from the pantries of the palace suggests that here the main building had only a single upper floor. Plaster offering tables were inventoried. All fragments of wall-paintings in the Chora Museum have now been digitally photographed, with mending focused on Hall 64 and Room 6; a surprising new find from the latter is a naturalistically rendered running lion. A survey of nautilus representations (Fig. 55) reveals the stylistic diversity of this motif. New joins were made to figures from the large-scale procession. 55.

Cosmopoulos (ASA) reports (Ergon [2008], 64 80) on excavation in the BA settlement. In the S sector, inves tigation continued of the layer containing 2 floors which bore evidence of destruction by fire. Both floors were made of pebbles and beaten earth, and covered by a layer of fire hardened earth which contained MHIII vessels and sherds, burnt pig and ovicaprid bones, various small finds, including an anchor-shaped pendant and 2 biconical spindle-whorls, and small fragments of burnt plaster. The 2 floors were separated by a heap of stones formed by the disintegration of wall foundations, burnt mud-brick and burnt MH coarseware.</page><page sequence="36">36 CATHERINE MORGAN In the S sector of the excavation there were at least 2 rooms occupied during the 2nd half of the MH period and destroyed by fire at the end of that period. This destruction was so extensive that it is impossible to define the location and direction of the walls or the plan of the rooms. It remains unclear whether these were 2 houses or 2 rooms in the same house. In the upper levels of both rooms were numerous LHIIIA2-LHIIIB sherds mixed with MH pottery, but there are no remains of walls to associate with them. In 2006, a long LHIIIA2-LHIIIB wall was excavated, associated with a stone paved area of uncertain function. Excavation of this area was extended to the E, exposing parts of 4 houses and water channels, which probably date to LHIIIA2-LHIIIB. (Fig. 56). House A has 3 rooms (Fig. 57). Room Al is rectangular (3.1m 2m), oriented NW-SW and enclosed by walls a, ?, and 5. The S half of wall a (up to 1.5m from its S end) preserved one course of large and medium-sized stones which bear strong traces of fire. By contrast, the half of the wall is built of 3 horizontal rows of medium-sized stones, with no traces of fire: this part of the wall was built after the fire had destroyed the original construction. Wall ?, which is also burnt, bonds and is contemporary with the S part of wall a, while walls y and , which enclose room Al to the E and N, are of different construction and do not bear signs of fire. The S part of the room contained a butterfly-shaped construction, of which parts of 2 burned walls survive. The floor of the room, made of pebbles and beaten earth, was built over a foundation course averaging 0.4m d. It is covered by a destruction layer 0.1-0.2m d., which contained fire-hardened earth (with very strong signs of fire in the S part of the floor, around the butterfly-shaped structure, but only sporadic traces in the half), stones and burnt pig, ovicaprid and bovine bones, and numerous LHIIIA2 LHIIIB sherds. On the floor and in contact with the arm of the butterfly-shaped structure, a large tripod vessel was found in situ. Room A2 lies to the E of Al, and is an irregular parallel ogram in shape. The floor is made of pebbles and beaten earth upon a foundation level as that of room Al. The pottery from room A2 was also identical to that from Al. Room A3 lies to the of A2 and is separated from it by wall e. It is a small room, perhaps used for storage; it was full of stones which had fallen from the later water channel constructed above. House A had 2 building phases. The earlier phase includes the S part of 57. Iklaina: house A. 58. Iklaina: house B. room Al with the S part of wall a, wall ? and the butterfly shaped structure inside the room, all of which were destroyed by fire. After this destruction, the room took its final form with the construction of the extension of wall a, walls y and , and the unburnt part of the floor. Rooms A2 and A3 belong to this same phase. The pottery of the 2 phases does not differ signif icantly, and it seems that they occurred in quick succession within the LHIIIA2-LHIIIB period. House lies to the E of house A. Room Bl, oriented NW SE (Fig. 58), is more recent than house A, and all its stones bear strong traces of burning. The interior has not yet been fully excavated, but part of a floor has been located. This floor is made of medium-sized stone slabs in beaten earth, on which lay LHIIIA2-LHIIIB sherds mixed with burnt earth and burnt animal bone. Room B2 has an E-W /. of 5.4m; its dimension N S is not yet established. In the E face of wall , a row of 5 large stones forms a large rectangular bench 0.4m /. 0.26m d. The floor of room B2 has not been uncovered, but the pottery from inside the room includes many LHIIIA2-LHIIIB sherds and sherds from burnt kylikes. House includes parts of 2 rectangular rooms oriented E-W. The E, and S walls of room survive, but the W wall was removed to lay down stone paving. On the floor, made of pebbles and beaten earth, was found a large quantity of LHIIIA2-LHIIIB pottery, including sherds of 2 rhyta and stems of at least 60 kylikes, an animal figurine and a large number of animal bones. The animal bones found in house belong mainly to pigs and ovicaprids, but there were also many bones of deer, wild boar and hares, which are evidence of extensive hunting. A set of deer antlers, on the verge of being shed naturally, indicates the animal was killed in the autumn. Finally, the discovery of a forest species of snail (Lindholmiola corcyrensis) demonstrates the existence of woodland nearby. At house , part of a building with at least 2 rooms was located at the edge of the excavation area. Room 1 was long and narrow (1.3m internal w.) and oriented N-S; the E-W dimension has not been established since the E part has yet to be excavated. An opening 0.5m w between the S end of wall y and wall ? of house forms the entrance to the building from an exterior space, probably a courtyard, which opens to the W and leads to a paved area. Room D2 was destroyed by the laying down of the paving and only 2 walls are preserved. Built water channels were placed between houses and ; these run E-SE and join the paved area in the W. Channel 1 is the largest; it is covered by 14 large slabs, set in a straight line which follows the slope. At the W end of the channel, by the</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 37 final cover slab, is a hole 0.1m di. and 0.22m d., filled with very fine gravel, which probably held a post to support the roof. From channel 2, only the channel itself and the cover slabs by the outflow are preserved. It lies 1.4m from channel 1 and curves from SE to NW. The NE corner of wall of room A3 was removed for the construction of the outflow of the channel. The walls of the channel outflows are built of upright slabs supported by smaller stones. They are filled with clayey earth and a very few undatable sherds. The outflows of the 2 channels come together at the NE edge of the paved area. A burial was found W of the long wall, at a d. of barely 0.4m below the mod. ground surface. Only the cranium, parts of the right arm and 2 spinal discs were excavated: a 12/15-year-old female, buried in an upright, contracted position, with the head markedly pushed down towards the chest and the right hand below the jaw. The young woman suffered from porous lesions on the right eye socket and porotic hyperostosis in the cranial vault. While the precise factors behind this case cannot be determined, these symptoms are generally associated with anaemia, which can be genetic, a result of lack of iron in the diet or of internal haemorrage caused by parasites. Additionally, the 3rd molars show excess enamel, something which is also present on the crowns of the canines and incisors. This feature indicates illness or bodily harm one or 2 years before death. The head rested on the neck and rim of a MH storage vessel. The results of excavation so far indicate that the settlement was first occupied in the 2nd half of the MH period, and was destroyed by fire at the end of that period. The site was reoccupied in LHII-LHIIIA1, as shown by the walls found at the deepest points in house (walls and ) and house (walls 5 and e). Thereafter, in the LHIIIA2-LHIIIB period, the oldest part of house A was built (the S part of room Al, with the S part of wall a, wall ? and the butterfly-shaped structure). Room Al was destroyed by fire during this same period but was soon reused and extended to the N, with the additions to wall a and wall ?, while rooms A2 and A3 were added to the house and wall was built. The next phase, which also dates to LHIIIA2 LHIIIB, encompasses houses , and , the water channels and the paved area, which co-existed with rooms Al and A2. The latest architectural feature to appear is the long wall, which was built at a higher level than wall of room Al and above the paved area. The settlement was finally destroyed by fire during LHIIIB, as is clear from burnt pottery in the destruction layer. ELEIA including TRIPHYLIA (7th EPCA: 6th EBA) Triphylia. J. Heiden (DAI) and C. R?hn (FH Wiesbaden) report on the 3rd campaign of study of anc. Triphylia. Plans of Samikon, Platiana, Lepreon and Vrestos were made at 1:2,000 scale. A first series of geophysical prospections, using geomag netometry, ground-penetrating radar and resistivity, took place at Skillous and Babes. Finds from older excavations at Samikon, Platiana, Lepreon and Vrestos (from both systematic excavation and cleaning by the Archaeological Service before 2002) were processed, and those which provide evidence for site chronology were catalogued and photographed. Samikon. The city wall (Fig. 59) and all visible architectural remains within it were recorded. The residential architecture indicates 2 chronological phases. In the centre, S of the agora, small isolated buildings were apparently arranged unsystemati cally, whereas in the E part of the city, residential houses were arranged along a rectilinear street grid. The city appears to have been built in the E4th Ct BC. 59. Samikon: city wall. Platiana. In the anc. city (Fig. 60) above mod. Platiana, the city walls, visible structures within them and a complex outside, to the SW, were recorded. The upper town contains a theatre and several other large public buildings, as well as smaller residential houses. These are arranged along a rectilinear street grid. Many remains of residential houses were also found on the very steep S slope. The upper town street grid is continuous here, despite the difficult topographic conditions. An isolated complex of buildings is located in the valley, far below the city. A tower house, built of large blocks, probably controlled the path leading up to the town. No finds predate the L5th Ct BC. Lepreon. The 2008 campaign located the city walls and the S plateau with the Temple of Demeter. Small rooms are integrated in the city wall almost along its entire length, as also within the wall separating the upper and lower town. A building in the W part of the wall, recently used as an animal shelter, must have been a gate. Besides Geo stray finds, artefacts from Lepreon include numerous Ar objects, such as pyxis lids, and many items (for example, sherds of plates, footed cups and skyphoi) of the 5th and especially the 4th Ct BC. Vrestos. Only initial fieldwork took place in 2008 at the anc. settlement near Vrestos.

So far, excavation has reached 4th Ct BC levels. Examination of the tower E of the Leonidaion (Fig. 61) produced a coin of Maximinus Thrax (AD 235-238) (Fig. 62) in its inner rubble fill: this is the first secure tpq for the fortifi cation of the sanctuary's central area. Geophysical survey conducted in collaboration with the 7th EPCA (AR 54 [2007 2008], 41) revealed several parallel linear anomalies E of the stadium. According to the location implied in anc. sources, they may belong to the hippodrome. Work was hampered by the subdivision of the area into small plots, thus producing only disconnected results. Further studies are planned for 2009. A new detailed architectural record of the Temple of Zeus proceeded.

Athanasoulis (formerly 6th EBA, now Director, 25th EBA) report on a 2nd season of survey of the underwater remains of an anc. naval base and Fr harbour. The harbour had an important geostrategic location and a tactical role in warfare and trade in W Greece from Cl antiquity to Med times, being the principal harbour of anc. Elis. The existence of Gr harbour structures below those of the Fr period was verified in 2007 and 2008. The aim of the survey is to record all architectural features in 3D. An area of ca. 350m 150m has so far been surveyed, and almost 16,000 topographical points taken, mapping topo graphical and archaeological features (Fig. 63). Marine geomorphological studies were undertaken by G. Papatheodorou and M. Geraga (Patras): marine surveying techniques employed include sub-bottom profiling, side-scan sonar and magnetometry. Most walls and structures are in shallow water and relatively easy to record using a total station: points deeper than 4m were recorded by a diver. Fig. 63 presents a preliminary plan of the study area in 2007 and 2008 with a digital elevation model of the mapped features in the background. The harbour entrance from the NE is clear: the mouth may have been blocked by the destruction of the towers on both sides of the entrance (matching literary descrip tions of the destruction of the installations in 1428). Fig. 64 is a more detailed preliminary plan of the structures at the E end of the study area: the darker areas are those parts currently above sea level. Wl is a typical Fr wall built in mixed technique employing reused ashlar blocks and rubble set in mortar. Structure Sia is a Gr platform of ashlar blocks, protected from the waves by the Fr structure Sib which is partially built on top of it. Sia clearly indicates the rise in relative sea levels from antiquity to the present day: surfaces currently 0.6m below sea level have cuttings for iron dowels set in lead, and thus must have been out of the water in antiquity.

Ladst?tter (Austrian Institute) reports on continuing excavation on the Solon terrace in the of the so-called acropolis. Here an extensive building, excavated since 1998, is accessed on its W side by a N-S road. Its ground-plan and the fact that it contains several baths and banqueting rooms suggest that it was a public guesthouse. The building was built in the LCI period and remained in continuous use until the LHel, undergoing various additions and modifications over time. It may have had a partial secondary use in the ERom Imperial period (AR 54 [2007-2008], 43-44). The 2008 excavations concentrated on the SW corner of the structure, enabling its full dimensions of 30m 28m to be verified (Fig. 65). In spite of its poor state of preservation, the S W corner of the guesthouse can be reconstructed as a peristyle courtyard, based on 3 surviving plinths of local conglomerate, placed as the corners of a square 4m w. This open court is surrounded on all 4 sides by halls 3.3m d.

Through a preserved door opening, this room gives access to the ensemble of antechamber and andron excavated in 2006 and 2007. Current understanding of the structure indicates that this S axis of rooms is the result of an E3rd Ct BC modification, when the original LCI building was extended to the S. As to its later use, excavation has indicated the following advanced Hel modifications in the peristyle and central room. In the context of the creation of a small bath in the wing of the peristyle, walls were placed between its pillars (2002, 2003 excavations); the S pillars were probably walled up at the same time (2008 excavation). Whether the peristyle remained an open courtyard at this time, or was roofed and integrated into the newly created complex, cannot be ascertained. The earth deposits that abutted the walled-up S row of pillars contained copious Hel material, which was placed in the course of levelling activity in connection with the architectural modifica tions. Apart from very small fragments of coarsewares and finewares, it included several substantially preserved plates, 2 small female terracotta heads, a bronze coin of Sikyon and sherds of a blue glass cup. In the 'central room', the floor was raised and a transverse wall placed in the E compartment, subdividing it into 2 equal sized 3m square rooms. The erection of this wall is contempo rary with the closure of the door to the antechamber; thus, we must assume that a new, N, access to the antechamber and andron was created at that time. Similar to the evidence from the part of the 'central room' (2006), in 2008 the S part was also found to contain deliberately introduced clay packings which formed the substructure for a new floor level; in some places, burnt clay floor levels had survived. These underfloor packings contained numerous finds: apart from heavily fragmented sherds of coarsewares and finewares, there were 2 carefully deposited and fully preserved filter jugs of advanced Hel date; a similarly carefully placed deposit in the same context consisted of a largely preserved Hel plate of local clay, together with a well-preserved Hel red-slipped juglet. It can be suggested that these vessels are connected with the symposi astic inventory of the andron to the SE. Another interesting 2008 find from the underfloor packing consists of 2 Hel clay protomes in the shape of female figures, roughly one-third life sized, and with outstretched arms. Several fragments of them had already been found in 2006. Of post-Hel use in the SW corner of the building, a wall survives in the area of the original E wing of the peristyle. This stone setting follows the orientation of the building, but its foundation is at a notably higher level than the Hel walls, and executed exclusively in conglomerate rubble. The open-plan excavation of architectural remains in the SW of the guesthouse was halted at the level of the lower edges of the Hel packings. As already noted in 2007, underneath them is a dark earth/clay packing 0.006m d. that contains exclusively PH pottery. A sounding in 2008 supported these results and provided numerous fragments of MNeo and LNeo vessels, and a few LMyc specimens (Fig. 66). In the context of the 2008 fieldwork, W. Gau? continued the study of finds from W. Alzinger's 1972-1981 excavations on the plateau SE of the acropolis. In parallel, S. Jalkotzy and E. Alram-Stern (Mycenaean Commission, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna) continued their study of the PH finds from Alzinger's 1972-1981 excavations on the acropolis. 65.

Kolia (6th EPCA) reports on systematic excavations conducted at this Ar-Cl sanctuary since 2004. The colonnade of a large Doric temple (36.4m 15.6m) of the end of the 6th Ct was revealed, along with an altar to the E. W of the Ar temple was a smaller temple (13.3m 8.7m) of the 4th Ct BC (Fig. 67). In 2008, a layer was excavated NW of the small temple which contained stone chips, sherds and fragmentary architectural members from the Ar temple (Fig. 68). Fragments of pedimental sculpture were found, as well as pottery, figurines, metal items (phialai, rings and handles from large vessels) and a silver knob from a vessel (perhaps a pyxis). The finds date mostly to the 6th and 5th Ct, and were placed at this spot after the destruction of the large temple in the 4th Ct. Under this layer was a wall of sandstone blocks, oriented N-S and preserved to the height of one course. This wall is 3.11m /. and 0.8-0.96m w., and is likely part of the Ar per?bolos of the sanctuary. Trapeza (Aigion). A.

The krepis and superstructure are of grey sandstone, and the large quantity of architectural members preserved (column drums and capitals, geison and epistyle blocks etc.) allows a secure recon struction of the building.

Mamousia: aerial view of the 2 temples. 68. Mamousia: Ar temple, antefix. sculpture, also of sandstone, belonging to the W pediment (and found together immediately outside the W front of the temple). These include the torso of a figure of Athena (wearing a sleeved chiton and himation, and with her aegis), fragments of the bodies and helmeted heads of warriors, and heads, legs and trappings of horses. This combination likely indicates that the subject of the pedimental group was a gigantomachy. While the base of the cult statue has been found in situ in the cella, there is no evidence as yet for the statue or for the identity of the deity worshipped. Surface prospection in the surrounding area has revealed walls, indicating that the temple was situated within a settlement area. The archaeological site has now been roofed. Gremoulias. G. Ladst?tter (Austrian Institute) and G. Alexopoulou (6th EPCA) report on continuing collaborative excavations on the Gremoulias saddle, 3.5km SE of Kalavryta. Since 2005, several soundings on the small plateau have gradually revealed a Doric peripteral temple. The substructure of the peristasis is almost entirely preserved in situ, and several limestone architectural members have been found, some still positioned as they had fallen. Above a euthynteria of 13.9m 34.75m, a colonnade of 6 14 can be reconstructed. The archi tectural members (and particularly the shape of the Doric capitals) indicate that this limestone temple was built no earlier than the 4th Ct BC. In 2007, a parallel foundation was discovered 10.2m E of the temple; its superstructure had fallen to the W.</page><page sequence="42">42 CATHERINE MORGAN Blocks, parts of column shafts and capitals of crystalline limestone can be ascribed to a monumental Doric structure of the L6th Ct BC and were reused as spolia (AR 54 [2007-2008], 44). The 2008 excavation concentrated on the LCI limestone temple and the structures to its E. In the W part of the temple, for the first time, the substructure of the sekos was exposed, as was part of the foundation of the S peristasis (Fig. 69). The fully preserved toichobate in the SW corner of the sekos is made of limestone slabs of varying sizes, laid on the ground without any foundation. In the carefully smoothed top surface, mortises for the blocks of the wall above it have survived in places. Based on their axial orientation, the stone settings found in the N-S section in 2005 also belong to the sekos. Thus, the relationship between sekos and peristasis in the building plan can be reconstructed as follows. The sekos had an outer w. of 6.6m and an internal w. of ca. 4.5m. This sekos, set symmetrically within the peristasis, is clearly narrower than the calculated position of the 2nd and 4th columns on the W fa?ade (axial distance 7.5m). Therefore, the W limit of the sekos should be assumed to have been a closed wall, not an opisthodomos harmonizing with the peristasis. This is further supported by the fact that within the 6.5m stretch of the W part of the sekos that was excavated, no internal traverse wall was detected: the sekos did not contain a separate W room. Generally, the ground-plan of the limestone temple, with its elongated peristasis of 6 14 columns and its strikingly narrow sekos, suggests LAr features, as known, for example, at the Temple of Athena at Alipheira. In this context, one should also note the numerous limestone architectural elements of the LAr Doric order that had been built into the wall E of the temple. It is more than likely that they belonged to a LAr peripteral temple, the ground-plan of which was reused for the LCI temple. To the E of the temple foundations, excavation was extended southwards in 2 soundings. This led to the discovery of the continuation of the N-S foundation. The rock, cut away to allow the placing of this foundation, has a right-angled W turn in the S, and exactly on that E-W axis, another limestone slab still rests in situ. In all likelihood the 2 in situ limestone slabs discovered in 2007 belong to a W foundation. Contrary to the initial 2007 interpretation of the remains as a supporting wall, it can now be assumed that they are part of a small-scale archi tectural structure measuring 4m by at least 7m and placed in axial symmetry 6.6m in front of the limestone temple. Probably, this is the altar of the sanctuary (Fig. 70). In 2008 as in 2007, several LAr architectural members made of limestone were discovered as they had fallen from the structure in which they were in secondary use. They include blocks, numerous fragments of Doric columns, one shaft surviving to a /. of 2.05m and a Doric capital fragment. It is noteworthy that the entire area of the altar so far excavated was characterized by a packing of dark burnt earth. Besides a few fragmented bones and scarce small chips of pottery, this area contained finds suggesting votive activity: the assemblage included an Ar female head with polos, a clay pigeon and numerous iron lance or spear points. A Geo bronze bull/cow was found, albeit in a secondary deposit, at the S peristasis of the limestone temple. Although the deity to whom this sanctuary was dedicated cannot yet be clearly identified, it can be assumed that the sanctuary on the Gremoulias saddle was already established in the Geo period. According to the results so far, a limestone peripteral temple was erected in the LAr period, marking the monumental ization of the sanctuary. For reasons that remain unclear, a new peripteral temple was erected, with direct reference to the original plan, in the LCI period; probably at the same time, an altar was built to its E, using numerous spolia from the old temple. 70. Gremoulias: S part of the altar (?) with spolia. IONIAN ISLANDS excluding Kythera Kerkyra (8thEPCA: 21st EBA) Paliavlako. A. Darlas, P. Karkanas, O. Pali and A. Papadea report (AAA 39 [2006], 11-30) on excavation conducted in 2002 by the (then unified) EPS and the 8th EPCA at this site, which lies close to the channel connecting Lake Korission with the sea. The discovery here in 2000 in Pleistocene levels of the lower-right jaw of a hippopotamus, together with smaller bones and a worked stone, confirmed human presence during the Pal period. The artificial channel connecting the lake to the sea exposed Pleistocene deposits 7m d. which lay above sea level; wave action then eroded a natural section into this, which was investigated archaeologically. It proved impossible to relocate the exact findspot of the jawbone due to continued erosion. Excavation therefore focused close by, 35m of the artificial channel. A trench was opened, initially 6m /. (then narrowed to 2m), 0.3-1 m w. and 4m d., exposing all 12 levels within the Pal deposits. Only the</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 43 terrestrial (or coastal) levels produced archaeological remains, whereas the lagoonal layers were sterile: the former were therefore sieved systematically and the latter only sampled. The 12 levels can be divided into 3 successive groups according to conditions created by the fluctuating sea level. Levels 1 and 2 reflect lagoonal or swamp conditions with drier periods. The lowest phase corresponds to the ashy clay of the MPleistocene. Levels 3-8 show a shifting complex of coastal and swamp deposits with frequent changes in coastline. Finally, levels 9-12 show a development of the above conditions, with beach sand and marshy deposits, concluding with the red clay palaeosurface. Marsh conditions correspond to periods of high sea level (probably through the post-glacial period), whereas coastal conditions correspond to low sea level. Beyond the area of the trench, 3 further levels were preserved above level 12, to a d. of 1.5m. Four further stone tools were collected from the shore immediately in front of the trench, and there are undoubtedly more lodged in this pebble beach. Archaeological material consists of stone flakes, tools and cores, and a few, poorly preserved, animal bones, few of which can be identified. The most carefully worked stone artefacts are assigned to the MPal (most probably to the end of the MPal or the beginning of the Upper Pal), and include examples of Levallois technology. Upper Pal lithics were found eroded out of the upper levels outside the trench. Most of the remains were not in situ; they represent secondary accu mulations after the erosion of older deposits. The assemblages of lithics in different layers are small and relatively unhomogeneous: it is argued that they derive from different parental formations. AITOLIA AND AKARNANIA (36th EPCA: 22nd EBA) Kouvaras Fyteion (Amphilochia). Further to the discovery of the LHIIIC tomb (ca. 1200 BC) that was reported in AR 54 ([2007-2008], 47), Eleftherotypia (01/10/08) cites a report by M. Stavropoulou-Gatsi (Director, 36th EPCA) on the results of chemical analysis of the bronze of the Naue II sword, which apparently indicates that it could have been an Italian import. Actium. Eleftherotypia (13/10/08) cites a report by I. Trianti (Ioannina) on excavation at the Temple of Apollo. The structure was 24.15m /. 9.2m w., with a transverse wall (3.43m); the walls, in opus reticulatum, were preserved to a h. of 1.75m. The partially preserved floor of the cella and pronaos was paved with pebbles. In the centre of the cella, a base 0.55m square was found set into the ground, around which the floor was decorated in pebble lozenges. The excavator observes that the base predated the floor, and this, together with the report of Fran?ois No?l Champoiseau (who first explored the site in 1867) that around a square base in the cella were found fragments of a colossal statue and inscrip tions with Hel and Ar letters, is taken to indicate the existence of an earlier temple. Champoiseau's discovery of 2 6th Ct kouroi (Louvre Ma 687 and 688, of Naxian origin) at the site, plus new discoveries of Ar geison fragments, a column (3m h. with 24 flutes) and much Ar pottery, confirm this. The Ar sanctuary was founded by the polis of Anaktorion, 7km away on the SE side of the gulf of Ambracia. The Rom temple was built after the battle of Actium, and is likely contemporary with the foundation of Nikopolis and the victory monument of Octavian (29-27 BC). PHOKIS AND WEST LOKRIS (14th EPCA: 24th EBA) Kirrha. J. Z?rbach (EfA) and D. Skorda (10th EPCA) report. Following an exploratory season in 2007, research focused first on a complete topographical survey, integrating remains previously excavated, and, secondly, on geomorphological and pedological survey of the entire plain. It is clear that from the LB A to LAntiquity, the shoreline lay 50-100m further out from the present coast, which means that the PH site cannot have been coastal: it is therefore argued that the so-called Cl and Hel dockyards (neoria) have probably been misidentified. The courses of the 2 rivers have also changed greatly in recent times and their courses nowadays are almost entirely artificial. In the course of geophysical survey, several locations on the tell were surveyed (the presence of olive trees making complete coverage impossible). What is probably a fossilized water course was traced W of the tell, which explains the abrupt line of the W hillslope which had been eroded by the flow of water, as well as the presence of a substantial terrace wall revealed during a rescue excavation conducted by the Ephoria. The Cl circuit wall was located at several points, and the presence of corner towers is now certain. Part of the Cl stoa, excavated in 1937 and 1938, was also securely located of the mound. This identification, along with that of the cemetery, provides a second fixed point from which to reconstruct the plan of the PH excavations of 1937-1938. Finally, in the E sector, the survey plan sometimes presents features open to detailed interpreta tion, leaving open the possibility of an apse or parallel walls. PH levels are present in 2 areas S and of the potter's kiln. The survey has shown that the PH site corresponds closely to the tell, and it therefore seems that the settlement did not move substantially during the PH period. Delphi Publication: J.-M.

Niemeier (Director, DAI) reports on the 5th season of excavation, which continued to concentrate on the area of the S temple. West of the W pteron of the Ar S temple, destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC, its limestone W pediment was excavated, lying as it had fallen. Whether and in what medium this pediment was decorated will ? only become clear after the difficult recovery of the severely burnt blocks. Also found in their fallen positions were terracotta fragments of the sima and the central acroterion (a horse protome). The combination of wood and stone in this temple is of particular interest. The stone pediment rested on wooden columns and a wooden entablature. Fig. 71 shows N. Hellner's restoration of the W fa?ade. W of the W ramp, the remains of the W pediment were removed in the process of building a bronze foundry in the final quarter of the 5th Ct BC. Three moulding pits have so far been discovered, 2 contained remains of clay moulds destroyed after moulding in the lost-wax technique. A working platform was constructed of reused roof tiles from the first Cl temple, destroyed by an earthquake in 426 BC. It appears that a statue for the second Cl temple was made here. In the Geo temple (discovered in 2007, since when its E part has been excavated), more of the metal votives placed at the time of its ritual interment, before the creation of a larger successor, were found. They include iron lance points and</page><page sequence="44">44 CATHERINE MORGAN 71. Kalapodi: reconstruction of the W fa?ade of the Ar S temple. 72. Kalapodi: LHIIIC M krater with figurai decoration. knives, bronze necklaces, rings and bird pendants. Of special interest is a bronze bowl with a repouss? relief of a circle of men, depicted frontally and touching each others' hands (cover illustration). This is an import of Syrian LHittite origin, a find interpreted as indicating that the international significance of the sanctuary (noted by Herodotus 1.46 for the 6l Ct) may have its origins as early as the 8th Ct BC. In the NE, the excavation of the Myc strata was completed with the removal of 2 baulks. This produced further important finds, mainly fragments of vessels used in the consumption of wine: cups, kylikes and kraters of the LHIIIC M phase with impressive figurai decoration. These include further pieces of a krater of which sherds had been found in previous excavations. This bears a depiction so far unique (Fig. 72):</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 45 men, armed with swords and carrying full sacks on poles over their shoulders, climb a ladder and enter a building, probably a fortification, with its masonry rendered in a chequerboard pattern. One man has fallen off the ladder and lies beneath it. A notable votive from the Myc layers is a lentoid seal of the Island Sanctuaries Group in veined limestone, depicting 2 bulls standing back-to-back. The Central Archaeological Council has now authorized the removal of the open structure, constructed after the Persian destruction from spolia in the ruined cella. It will therefore be possible to examine the older, Geo to Myc, phases here, in the assumed original centre of the sanctuary. E A (9th EPCA: 23rd EBA) by Robert K. Pitt Publication: V.

Burke (Canadian Institute/Victoria), . Bums (Wellesley), S. Lupack (London), V. Aravantinos (Director, 9th EPCA) and I. Fappas (Thebes Museum) report on the 2nd field season, which focused on the area surrounding the mod. village of Tanagra, in an effort to provide a context for several known centres: the Myc tombs at the locations of Dendron and Gephyra to the E of the village, the kastro located on the peak to the SW and the Med tower to the NW. Three teams of walkers surveyed 703 units within an area of 5km2, in which individual transects totalled 175 km. Several of the chamber tombs, which contained the famous painted larnakes excavated in the 1960s and 1970s, were located, as were indications of settlement remains. The cemeteries were composed primarily of roughly hewn chambers cut into the natural bedrock. The largest concentra tion of tombs around Eleon is below the Church of Profitis Ilias, where over 20 chambers have been identified. These were revisited and more extensively mapped in 2008. A similar number of chamber tombs (Fig. 73) was mapped and surveyed in olive groves near mod. Tanagra, in a location known as Dendron, during the excavations by T. Spyropoulos. Some impressive surface ceramics collected in 2008 in the vicinity of the tombs clearly date to the Myc period, including an LHIIB goblet with pendant rock pattern that predates the main phase of tomb deposition in LHIII. R. Siddal began a geological and p?trographie survey of the survey area, focusing on the E side of the region, in order to complete a map of subsurface deposits, the sourcing of building material, and a reconstruction of tectonic history and shifts in water sources. Thebes. V. Aravantinos (Director, 9th EPCA) and I. Fappas (Thebes Museum) report on a rescue excavation in the S part of the anc. acropolis. Earlier excavations in this sector had brought to light a large Myc building complex (Fig. 74) with floors of square bricks and fragments of wall-painting depicting a female procession. From July 2008 to January 2009, excavation at 3 Eurydike Street revealed a structure with a thick destruction layer of the M 13th Ct, containing roof beams and cover tiles, many of which were found intact (and weighing between 8.5kg and 9.5kg each). This roof is estimated to have weighed at least 4 tons, and covered impressive, if poorly preserved, architectural remains, probably part of the Myc palatial complex (Fig. 75). Two especially large and well-built walls with door jambs, built in the Myc style of large roughly worked boulders with smaller stones wedged between them, form a central area, which contained fragments of frescoes. In the centre of the floor was a large bath tub with an impression on its base of a burnt basket which had been positioned next to it at the time of the destruction of the building. of this central area was a rectangular open corridor, and a large covered area. From inside this room came much broken pottery, small glass beads with depictions in relief, burned fragments of painted wall-plaster, a steatite seal with a depiction of a horse and a gold attachment shaped like a flower petal. A spacious rectangular room excavated further completes the plan of the building. Numerous drinking vessels (kylikes and cups) were found, along with a bronze dagger with gold rivet heads. However, the most important find was a 6-sided clay plaque (Fig. 76) with two holes for hanging, decorated with fish, possibly dolphin or tuna, on all 6 sides. A similar object (Fig. 77) was found in the previous excavation, along with an impressive dagger handle and a fragment of a bronze dagger with gold rivet heads on the clay floor of the neighbouring room. This also carried decoration on all four long sides, which are decorated alternately with a palm and chequered pattern. The building was destroyed by fire in the M13th Ct BC. The data from both this and earlier excavations on the top of the citadel show that the region was at this time a fairly luxurious and densely populated neighbourhood of Myc Thebes. 73.

Dunn (BSA/Birmingham) and E. Gerousi (Director, 23rd EBA) report on the 2008 study season. A Digital Elevation Model of the site was completed, and topographical and architectural surveys of all visible structures in and around Thisve corrected and supplemented. Eleven EByz, MByz and Fr churches and chapels have been recorded: at least 2 are probably MByz of the inscribed cruciform plan with 4 central piers (spolia) and 3 semicircular apses. Less typical is the ruined, multi-phase church now known as Ag. Loukas (almost certainly the Episcopal church of the bishopric of Kastorion). Phase I of this building shows design traits related either to the high-status 'transitional' type of the L6th-9th Ct or to the Panagia of Skripou (873/874 AD).</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 47 The uppermost part of the central apse is entirely faced with well-arranged ashlars divided by a reused cornice. Attached to the NW corner is a monumental cistern. Re-examination of the disposition of Cl-Rom architectural blocks in secondary use as orthostats in locations around the lower acropolis confirmed the outlines of several rectangular buildings which might be either Byz or associated with the diagnostically Fr chambered tower and spolia-built chapel. A record has been made of the traditional productive instal lations of the overlying village (Ot Kakosi; renamed Thisve in the 20th Ct). These comprise 8 wine fermentation vats ( ), 15 cobbled threshing floors (including 12 clustered around the lower acropolis) and monumental cisterns. A survey of Thisve's dam or barrage was completed. There are no traces of the Rom or Byz phases reported by some EMod travellers, who almost certainly misinterpreted overlying spolia-built agricultural terraces, of which traces remain. The interpretation of this dam will be aided by a parallel environ mental survey of the enclosed Thisve basin. Anc. Thisve and Byz Kastorion had several loci of maritime traffic. Between 2 of these, and visually controlling them both, lies an unpublished Cl-Hel tower described by El 9th Ct travellers. This was located and surveyed on behalf of the 9th EPCA. Thespiai. B. Slapsak (Netherlands Institute/Ljubljana) reports on the continuing survey of Thespiae as part of the Ancient Cities of Boeotia Project. In 2008, geophysical prospection and the plotting of scattered blocks and architectural members continued. Some blocks of the Hel city wall were found in situ in the NW sector. An important section of the mud-brick acropolis wall was recorded on the SW slope, 5.5m h. and 3.3m w. at its top. Of the 29 inscriptions recorded by the team, 2 are of particular interest: one provides the first attestation at Thespiae of the office of the pentekistologoi; a second is a bilingual building inscription of Domitian, possibly dated to 86 AD. EUBOIA (11th EPCA: 23rd EBA) Lefkandi Xeropolis. I.S. Lemos (BSA/Oxford) reports on the 6th season of excavation. The aims for 2008 were to investigate further the LHIIIC and EIA 'megara' in region I and, in region II, to understand the function, extent and date of the 'walls' and to excavate further the structures W of them. In region I, a LHIIIC (Lefkandi phase 2a) structure was discovered under the LHIIIC 'megaron' (Fig. 78). This was equipped with clay bins and pebble floors typical of the period, and is on the same orientation as contemporary houses previously discovered. The building was abandoned and the area reused after a short interval, but with an alteration to the orientation of the building (now N-S), which took place most probably during Lefkandi phase 2b when a number of other houses in this part of the tell maintain the earlier grid lines. The 2nd change was to the plan of the building, which is now a long, rectangular structure. The end is lost to the erosion of the hill 78. Lefkandi, Xeropolis: LHIIIC 'megaron' and surrounding area.</page><page sequence="48">48 CATHERINE MORGAN and the construction of a LGeo house, and it is therefore unclear whether or not the building was apsidal. The duration of occupation of the LHIIIC 'megaron', as indicated by the pottery, is not yet determined, although it certainly includes White Ware of Lefkandi phase 2b/3, nor is the reason for its abandonment and thorough clearance. Further study is also required to determine the interval between this abandonment and the erection of the EIA successor. Investigation to the E of the buildings revealed more about the structure termed the 'annex', which seems to follow closely the history of occupation of both the LHIIIC and the EIA 'megara'. Further E, other walls similar in construction imply the existence of further rooms: while these were not investi gated, they raise the possibility that there was a series of ancillary rooms or units to serve the needs of the 'megaron' during both its LHIIIC and EIA phases. Finally, to the and just outside the 'megaron' was the flexed skeleton of a young girl (to judge from the 2 pins found on the shoulders, a conical button and a pierced shell). The date of the burial is hard to determine stratigraphically: it ought to be later than the pre LHIIIC building, a date which agrees with the LHIIIC M-L date assigned to the pins. In region II, the 'walls' are now understood as a comple mentary series of straight, lengthy constructions which defined the W and S edges of the 'hollow' zone (Fig. 79). They may delineate the area through which the site was entered from the N, across the low land isthmus and between the possible 2 lagoons to the E and W of Xeropolis. The date of their earlier phases should be primarily within LHIIIC. Excavation has revealed detailed information about the sequence of construc tion and reconstruction of these walls, the locations of entrances and the insertion of drains. The final abandonment of the S (interior) wall was accompanied by large-scale landscaping to cover the remains. The so-called 'ritual' zone (at present a term of convenience) was further investigated. Structure A, dating to LHIIIC (Lefkandi phase 1), is the earliest yet recorded. The irregularity of its form and the different construction techniques used indicate a complicated structural history: further excavation is needed to clarify its plan. Two main floor surfaces of yellow clay were separated by a thin layer of intensely carbonized soil, probably not associated with a destructive fire. Above the 2nd floor, a thicker mix of carbonized soil and pis? was observed. The furniture in the rooms is highly distinctive. Associated with the 1st floor are 2 yellow clay drums of different heights set against the middle of the S wall and a red-brown clay bin against the wall. In the 2nd phase, another and larger yellow clay drum was set in the middle of the room, on the same N-S axis, and with it was found a large and shallow receptacle of reddish clay. On top of the supporting surface for the receptacle, and within its limits, a complete large red-deer antler was carefully set (Fig. 80). Structure to the S is a rectangular building (4.6m 3.75m) similar in form to the partially overlying structure C, although its internal furniture and depositional history resemble that of structure A. An intermediate position in both time and building type is indicated. To its W an exterior zone contains perhaps the earliest of the circular 'platforms' and a large shallow pit. 79. Lefkandi, Xeropolis: region II.</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 49 80. Lefkandi, Xeropolis: red-deer antler on receptacle in structure A. Structure C, a two-phase building, is the latest so far discovered (in use between LHIIIC L and MPGeo): it overlies structure B, but its internal furnishing and depositional history are quite different. It contained circular 'platforms' made of different sized stones and pebbles. A shallow rounded hollow was formed; its edge ringed with medium-sized stones to form a kerb within which similar and smaller stones were laid to make a close-packed ring. Then ever smaller stones, pebbles and near-gravel were sequentially scattered to fill up the cracks. A slightly domed and compacted upper surface is the end result. No ash, burning or bones are associated. A number of spindlewhorls and a few pendants were the only finds. The only intrusive elements are sheets, lumps and flecks of a white plaster. Their appearance (never on a floor, nor attached to a wall or a feature) raises the question of whether structure C was roofed (no postholes were found in or around it). Pottery discovered to the E of structure C includes large to monumental kraters and cooking pots found together with much animal bone. Cooking appears to have taken place where the pots were found: thus eating and drinking took place outside, but close to, structure C. Although the purpose of these structures is not yet clear, we assume that the whole area associated with the 'walls' was devoted to some kind of ritual activity. Indeed, the recovery in area R and to the of the 'walls' of a number of high quality figurines may suggest that they originated from the so-called ritual area to the W. Alternatively, the whole area may have been dedicated to the processing of olive oil or wine. In this case the clay drums might have served as rests for the vessels in which olives or grapes were crushed, with receptacles set lower on the floor or on another drum nearby. In order to resolve this, samples have been taken from the dark soils and from the clay drums for testing. Residues from the environ mental samples will be further scrutinized for evidence of any fruits discarded. Eretria. S. Fachard and T. Theurillat (Swiss School) report on a rescue excavation conducted in collaboration with the 11th EPCA (under A. Psalti) on the property (O.T 737) of P. Vrakas, S of the plot excavated by P. Themelis between 1974 and 1984 (O.T. 740, summarized in PAE [1984], 212-28) (Fig. 81). The goal was to verify the extension of some structures discovered by P. Themelis and to ascertain the different chronological phases represented on the plot. In the Geo period, 2 walls to the E protected the sector from intense flooding. M23 served as an embankment wall, preserving the settlement to the W from the sands and pebbles of the river to the E. It was built in ca. 725 BC, abandoned at the end of the 8th Ct and replaced by a 2nd embankment wall (M24). The function of M22 is more difficult to assess, since it seems unlikely to belong to the apsidal building, GG, restored by Themelis. The current absence of floor levels, pits or graves suggests that the area lies on the periphery of this settlement quarter. Occasional finds in the deepest layers include a small Neo serpentine axe and a MGeoII Attic krater (Fig. 82). Ar and Cl layers are rare, to the point that some Hel strata follow Geo layers. This may imply that the sector was scarcely occupied during these periods, although later construction has certainly obliterated earlier layers. Most of the 2008 discoveries date to the Hel period. Several phases can be distinguished between the very end of the 4th Ct BC and the 1st Ct BC. The of the plot is occupied by a small street lined with 2 walls (M32 and Ml). In a first phase, 2 pits (St33 and St 19) of the first half of the 3rd Ct BC were found S of Ml. The pottery is mainly domestic in character, with a high proportion of cooking ware (lekanes, chytres, mortars, lopades) and drinking vessels (bowls and kantharoi). Several walls could belong to this first phase of occupation: M30 and probably M20 and M12. The floor level related to this phase is at 3.9masl. In a 2nd phase, M30 and M20 were reused to form a quadrangular building (8m 6m) composed of deep foundation walls (M4, Mil, Ml6 and M17). The pottery associated with the foundation trench suggests a tpq in the M2nd Ct BC. Its function remains unclear since no clearly identifiable structures have been discovered inside. A well (St26) in the NW corner is probably contemporary, although it could also belong to the previous phase. Numerous finds related to metalworking were discovered in the immediate surroundings of the building: a low-shaft furnace (St3), connected with burned layers, slags and iron 'skullcaps', testifies to ore refining. Ml was probably pierced during the same phase, in order to install a threshold and canalization (St25) for the evacuation of waste water in the street. A coin hoard (Stl5) containing more than 30 badly preserved bronze coins was discovered at the foot of Ml2; their identification is not possible at present. Although P. Themelis' excavations showed that the entire quarter was densely occupied in the Rom period, few Rom remains were discovered in 2008. To the W, 2 foundation walls (M6 and M7) can be linked to the monumental building excavated by Themelis. To the E, a thick deposit of the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD seals the Hel occupation. This contains numerous fragments of glass and terracotta figurines, Italian sigillata, several lamps with decorated discuses and 3 coins of the Imperial period. This first campaign on the O.T. 737 plot confirmed P. Themelis' chronology of the Quarter of the Panathenaic Amphorae (O.T. 740) and supplements the plan of an important urban sector of the town occupied from the Geo to the Rom period. Publication: S.

PHTHIOTIS AND EAST LOKRIS (14th EPCA: 24th EBA) Cornell Halai and East Lokris Project (CHELP). J. Coleman (ASCSA/Cornell) reports on continuing study of the Neo architecture and finds (especially pottery) from the acropolis of Halai. Cleaning and conservation work on the acropolis of Halai continued throughout the season. In area F, cleaning operations focused on the Byz intrusion at the E side of trench F9 first noticed by Virginia Grace in 1931 and on the S sides of trenches F9 and FI 1, where, during preparations for a path and viewing station for visitors, the probable S wall of Neo building VI was revealed. Mitrou. E. Zahou (14th EPCA) and A. Van de Moortel (ASCSA/Tennessee) report on the 5th season of excavation in 2008, which focused primarily on 2 areas in the NE and NW of the islet. In addition, 3 outlying trenches were opened in previously unexcavated areas in the NE corner (LR797), at the E sea scarp (LX784) and in the central-E area (LR770) of the islet (Fig. 83). The earliest levels reached dated to EHIIB. In trench LX784, at least 2 EHIIB occupational levels with substantial walls were found, situated close to sea level. EHIIB and EHIII levels were also exposed during cleaning of the W sea scarp of the islet, and EHIII walls were uncovered in trench LR797 in the NE corner of the islet. The EH settlement was therefore extensive. In all these locations, fired roof tiles were found as well as Lefkandi I pottery and EH vessels of the local tradition. Too little was exposed to understand building plans or the layout of the settlement. A clay seal found in the sea NW of the islet may be EHII in date. The MH settlement may have been equally extensive, with architectural remains identified at the E and W sea scarps as well as in the NE and NW excavation areas. A LMH wall (no. 149) and pebble surface were uncovered E of and below the LHI-LHIIIA2 E monumental building D in the NE excavation area (trench LP783) (Fig. 84). These are the first securely dated remains of the MH settlement in this area. In the NW excavation area, at least 5 successive MHI and MHII occupation strata and cist tombs were excavated in 2007. A wooden boat partially excavated in 2007 has now been dated to MHI. In trench LX784, on the E sea scarp, at least 5 successive MHI and MHII strata were likewise uncovered, including 2 rectilinear buildings: building (MHI-MHII E) and building L (MHI). Too little was exposed to reveal the plan of those buildings. Building had at least 2 rooms; its northernmost exposed room had a built oval hearth covered with plaster. Substantial amounts of pottery were associated with these MH strata. Excavation of ELH levels continued in the NE excavation area (Fig. 84). The remainder of the W wall of building D was uncovered, revealing that its S part had been robbed out over a distance of ca. 5m. No floor deposits have yet been found inside building D, although the excavation is not finished. The central interior area of building D had been converted into a monumental tomb during its last period of use, and possibly as early as LHIIB. The tomb is rectangular (ca. 5m 2m) with walls of mud-brick, and lined on the interior with large cut sandstone slabs, ca. lm w. and 1.2m h. One slab is preserved intact and fragments of several more were found in situ. The tomb had been robbed in antiquity, but some human bones remained, as well as a gold ring, a fragmentary gold bracelet, a bronze ring, a piece of pierced gold foil and a small rock-crystal disk. Possibly at this same time, the exterior walls of building D were rebuilt and widened. The absence of interior faces is remarkable and may indicate that at this time the entire building was filled with debris and turned into a tumulus. Building D was bordered by pebbled streets to the W and N. No street was uncovered E of building D, but remnants were found of LHI, LHIIB and LHIIIA structures that apparently belonged to the same architectural complex as building D, but had much thinner walls. Most of this complex lies outside the excavation area. In the NE corner of the islet, a grave plot was uncovered with a monumental cist grave (grave 51), ca. 1.8m 1.5m 0.9m, built of roughly hewn large limestone slabs. Parallel and perpendicular to this monumental grave were smaller cist graves. All graves of this plot had been robbed, but one cist tomb (grave 50) could be dated to LHI by a bichrome matt painted amphoriskos contained within it (it also held a small bronze spiral). Study of the pottery continues, but it is likely that all these graves are of ELH date. Two more LHI cist tombs (graves 53 and 56) as well as an MHIII or LHI wall were fqunp1 in trench LX784 at the E scarp of the islet. Grave 56 belonged to a juvenile buried with an LHI Grey Minyan teacup, a spindle whorl and an obsidian blade. Fragments (perhaps not in situ) of a collapsed MHIII or LHI kiln were found, representing the latest BA occupation in that location. In trench LR770 in the E-central area of the islet, 2 substantial parallel stone walls bordered a 2m w. earth and pebble street. This street runs parallel to that on the side of building D, ca. 65m further N, and appears to be part of the same orthogonal street pattern. The 2 walls date at least to LHIIB, but may have been constructed earlier. On the latest surface of the street, in a mixed LH/PGeo context, was a small clay figurine of a parturient squatting female, which appears to be of non-local origin (Fig. 85). In the NW excavation area, only one trench was opened (LG790), connecting 2 previously excavated trenches. Here walls and surfaces belonged to the same 2 successive LHI occupation levels found in the adjacent trenches in previous years. An earlier cist tomb (grave 72) of a child buried with a Grey Minyan amphoriskos of LHI or MH date was also found. On top of the LHI strata were successive LHIIA and LHIIB levels, including a few walls and a substantial LHIIB burned destruction level with broken pottery and several animal horns. To the NW, these strata were much disturbed, and the stratigraphy of the adjacent trench LF790 will remain unclear until further study is undertaken.</page><page sequence="52">52 CATHERINE MORGAN 83. Mitrou: plan of the islet with the 2004-2008 trenches.</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 53 Palatial period occupation (LHIIIA2 L and LHIIIB) remains scarce at Mitrou. No new architectural remains dating to this period have been found in the E of the islet. In trench LG790 in the NW excavation area, limited architecture was revealed. One wall (no. 64) was reused, and perhaps a small curved enclosure wall (no. 65) abutting it was built at this time. A largely intact LHIIIA phi-figurine was found in a disturbed context. In the same unit was a steatite lentoid seal stone modified into a bead, which is not closely datable. A large LHIIIB2 L pottery dump was found against the S scarp of trench LP782, SE of building D. At the end of LHIIIB or the beginning of LHIIIC, 2 new walls (nos 119, 120) were constructed in trench LG790 and a new surface laid. On this surface a bronze knife was found. In addition, the 2 palatial period walls continued in use. Contrary to previous reports, these are the first securely dated post-palatial architectural remains found thus far in the NW excavation area. They establish for the first time that the post palatial settlement reached this far W. In the NE excavation area, the latest surface of the pebbled street W of building D dates to LHIIIC. Thus the mass of large roughly cut blocks found on top of it and blocking this street must have fallen there in LHIIIC, and not during the LHIIIA2 E destruction, as previously conjectured. It is not yet clear from which building these large blocks came. More excavation and study is needed in order to reconstruct the architectural history of this area. Inside building (the LHIIIC successor to building D), one or two LHIIIC L surfaces were uncovered as well as fragmentary walls (nos 40, 41, 116) of a small structure (building J) that must postdate building and probably also building C. The remains of a largely destroyed cist grave were found on top of the monumental tomb, and can be plausibly associated with an LHIIIC L clay feeding bottle. At least 2 cist graves (nos 70 and 71) found E of building D may date to LHIIIC L or EPGeo. Cist 70 included a handmade miniature dipper cup similar in style to the miniature vases of building C. A 3rd cist grave (no. 69) in this area is datable to the SubMyc or EPGeo period by an intact cup on top of its capstone. Burial 52 S of building B, excavated in 2007, can now be dated to LHIIIC. One new PGeo structure was uncovered. Building I is a small rectilinear structure with thin walls just S of building E. Because of its close proximity to building E, it probably also dates to LPGeo. Below the apse of building A was a rough semicircular platform, possibly a hearth and probably LHIIIC or PGeo in date, on top of which was a steatite seal stone of the Mainland Popular Group (Fig. 86). Nearby were a miniature stone axe, a spindle-whorl and possibly a clay spool. In addition, the walls of trench LR770 in the E-central area of the islet may have been reused at this time. Several new PGeo cist graves were uncovered in many locations just below the plough zone, including at the E sea scarp, although not in trench LR797 in the NE corner of the islet. Most of these tombs had been robbed. Cist 57 W of building I contained a miniature patterned amphoriskos or amphoroid krater, and cist 49 in trench LX784 at the E scarp a fragmentary obsidian blade. Cists 59 and 63 in trench LR770 in the E-central area are of MPGeo or LPGeo date. Each contained a baby skeleton but no finds. By far the richest finds were found in the LPGeo cist grave 62 in trench LG790 in the NW excavation area. The tomb belonged to a ca. 6 year-old child buried with 3 small clay cups, a juglet, a feeding bottle and a pyxis, as well as 2 bronze pins, one or more bronze earrings, a bronze bracelet, a bronze ring, an indeterminate piece of bronze jewellery and a bead. 84.

Sythiakaki (DeltChAE 39 [2008], 207-20) present an architectural study of the Church of Ag. Nikolaos, which is dated to the end of the 12th or E13th Ct AD, with the original wall-painting decoration dated to the last quarter of the 13th Ct. THESSALY with the NORTHERN SPORADES Nomos of Magnesia (13th EPCA: 7th EBA) The Pilion Cave Project. N. Andreasen (Danish Institute) and A. Darlas (EPSVE) report on the 2nd survey season, which focused on the E part of the mountain between the villages of Kalamaki in the S to Veneto in the N. Fifty one localities were surveyed, counting 32 caves, 12 rock-shelters and 7 abandoned mines. A typology of 10 types of cave-use was developed. Three hundred and forty six surface finds were collected from 17 caves and rock-shelters, 2 of which had already been visited in 2006. The finds comprised mainly pottery sherds and animal bones. Diagnostic artefacts from 5 caves in the Mouresi municipality (Tsounaga, Tsouka, Gouronotrypa, Bourdovanou and Damouchari IV) consisted mostly of PH and Hel-Rom pottery, but also included polished stone tools and a human jaw. Four of the localities are deep caves and one is an anc. mine. A number of caves on the mountain were used from the LNeo/EBA. The character of their use cannot be established from surface finds, but is probably not exclusively related to herding. Several previously undocumented caves played locally significant roles during World War II and the Gr Civil War. An important discovery was the find of a cave 2.5km SW of Veneto where the Gr Resistance stored ammunition and equipment during World War II. Although the Gr military emptied the cave of ammunition and explosives after the Civil War, more than 40 combat helmets were found at the site along with buckles, leather straps and military iron pack frames for mules. The helmets are World War I 'Adrian' style helmets and World War II M33 models, of which some have preserved leather padding. It is possible that this equipment was obtained from Italian units stationed at Pilion when they left the region in 1943. Another cave above the village of Mouresi was used as a provisional field hospital for the Resistance during World War II and later as a refuge for several local families. The main chamber of the cave is accessed vertically and it is difficult to enter without a ladder. No artefacts or fireplaces were found, as visibility is severely limited. A significant implication of the survey and the accompa nying interviews is that the spectrum of activities performed at caves and in rock-shelters within our region is much broader than initially anticipated. Only in a few cases could artefact distributions or artefact types be related to any specific activity. Some cave uses connected to agro-pastoral, religious and military activities tend to be ephemeral and leave little cultural material behind. This is the case even where several persons, a family or groups of people are involved. One such example is a cave which served as a secret field hospital during World War II. At this locality there was no visible cultural material left on the surface that could point to such use. Other confirmed /refuge-caves', partisan hide-outs or quarantine caves are equally invisible in an archaeological sense, despite their local and historical significance.

This was occupied through the first half of the 5th millennium BC before being destroyed by fire: there are also traces of fire in earlier phases of the settlement, which have yet to be investigated. Houses are constructed both in the wattle-and-daub technique (noting that the burnt mud-plaster preserved impressions of the wood) and in mud-brick, and have clay roofs. The settlement contains clay ovens set in open spaces, much pottery including excellent examples of decorated wares, stone grinding and cutting tools, a few terracotta figurines and loomweights indicating the weaving of wool. The site was reused in the Hel period (3rd Ct): 15 tombs were found (cists, pits and free burials), containing no grave goods. Tyrnavos. I Akropoli (25/03/09) cites a report by A.

The graves contained the remains of both adults and children, variously oriented but usually in extended position with the hands crossed on the chest, across the pelvis or by the sides. In 2 cases, the bodies lay on their side with the knees bent. Pottery found in the graves included plainware vessels, a perfume vessel, sherds from funerary vases, as well as pottery in the style of Bratislavan ware and ware from Petromagoula near Volos. Stone and bone tools, flint points and cores, and obsidian blades were also included. Among the more</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 55 significant finds was a semicircular construction which probably marks out a burial area; on the exterior was a child's cranium, on the interior the cranium of an adult, and there were traces of burning over the entire area.

The date, and the Mousterian technique of the stone tools in the analogous level, suggest that the first occupants were Homo Sapiens neanderthalensis.

Two rulers are depicted (a man named Komnenos Doukas and his wife, named Anna Komnenodoukene Palaiologina), being crowned by the Virgin holding Christ in her arms, along with two princes: these are likely Nikephoros I and his sons Thomas (proclaimed despot in spring 1294) and Thamar (who was married in summer 1294), thus providing a likely date for the painting. Nomos of Thesprotia (32nd EPCA: 8th EBA) Thesprotia Expedition. B. Fors?n (Finnish Institute) reports on the 5th field season, which consisted of continued geo archaeological work, further palynological sampling from Lake Kalodiki at Morphi and trial excavations at 3 sites. Coring was also undertaken in Lake Acherousia to learn more about its general environmental development. The first site where trial trenches were opened, PS 12, lies on the lowermost E slope of the Liminari hill in the village of Sevasto. Probes here in 2007 revealed mainly FNeo and EBA pottery, but also some LNeo and ENeo-MNeo sherds. The aim was therefore to explore the ENeo and MNeo presence, and to estimate the site size. In trench D2 more ENeo 'impresso' sherds were found, although no ENeo-MNeo layer. The early sherds were found mixed with FNeo and EBA pottery and spindle whorls. In the hope of finding undisturbed ENeo to MNeo remains, probe H was located on a small terrace uphill. This produced remains of a dramatic erosion phase containing large stones mixed with bone, pottery and some roof tiles. The finds are mostly historical in date, perhaps Ar or Cl, and indicate the existence of a settlement of this date somewhere higher upslope. The main trench was located N-S through what is believed to be the centre of the site. Initially it was dug in 5 Im 2m sequences, separated by a couple of metres, but, later, one of the tests was enlarged when remains of a rudimentary wall were found. The wall, which consists of 2 courses of stones to a h. of 0.2-0.3m, was exposed to a /. of 9m without uncovering corners. No floor level was found next to the wall. Pottery of the FNeo and EBA, as well as some of MBA and LBA date, was found just above and around it. Preliminary pottery analysis indicates some parallels with the FNeo and EBA repertoires at Doliana near Ioannina, Servia in Macedonia, Pefkakia in Thessaly and, to some extent, Lerna and Franchthi in the Argolid. Most of the EBA parallels are EHII. Three C14 samples from trenches A (excavated in 2007) and D date to EHII, whereas the 2 samples taken next to the wall date to the MBA and LBA. In order to study the size of PS 12, soil samples were taken in its immediate surroundings. Preliminary results indicate that the site is much larger than previously thought, perhaps close to 100m 100m. The 2nd site excavated was Ag. Donatos, Zervochori (PS 25), a small hill fortified around 300 BC. Investigation focused on the ordinary house walls inside the fortification. On the basis of intensive surface survey these seemed to be mostly ERom (opus incertum), although some pieces looked older (possibly Hel). Four trenches were opened, revealing almost exclusively ERom (lst-2nd Ct AD) finds. By combining the opus incertum walls visible above the surface with those found in the trial trenches, the outlines of a large building, built on 2 terraces that open to the S, are seen. The building is at least 140m 30m, although it remains unclear where it ends towards the W. Due to heavy erosion, especially around the Chapel of Ag. Donatos, the building is badly preserved and most of the trenches contained collapsed and mixed layers. Part of the original concrete floor (cocciopesto) was found only in one trench. It is clear that the building once was of high status, as shown by fragments of wall-painting (panels in different colours) and a few palmette antefixes (Fig. 87). Probably it was a villa rustica 87.

No finds date later than the ERom period, except for a grave ca. 10m of the Chapel of Ag. Donatos. The burial, 0.2m below the surface, was placed in a simple cist of 1-2 courses of rounded stones. No grave gifts were found with the skeleton, which probably belonged to a young woman. Single human bones from other individuals were found close to the chapel, some even on the surface. Obviously, there was a small cemetery next to the 17th Ct chapel, most likely contemporary with it. At Kioteza, Agora (PS 34), a small EHel fortification ca. lkm from Ag. Donatos was investigated to gain a better picture of its structure and date. Two small trenches were opened, one in the only tower of the fortification, the other at the probable gate. In the tower the rubble fill was encountered ca. 0.2m below the surface. The trench located at the presumed gate produced very few finds, but supports the assumption that there was a gate here, some 1.15-1.2m w. and protected by indented traces on both sides.

Kleitsas (12th EPCA), E. Kotjabopoulou and A. Panatsi (Archaeological Institute for Epirotic Studies) report on the first season of excavation at the site of Ellinika, on the SE flanks of Mt Olytsika (anc. Tomaros) at an elevation of 550masl. Positioned along a possible anc. mountain route, the site commands a panoramic view of the complex valley network that ultimately leads from the Ionian coast to the oracular sanctuary of Dodona. A number of fortified citadels, as yet unexcavated, are scattered close by (for example, Kalogeritsa - Theriakision, Ag. Georgios Kopanis, Mirodaphni Peston). Visible architectural remains, along with plundered Hel cist graves, were first reported here by I. Vokotopoulou (ADelt 23 [1968], 292), but no systematic exploration was undertaken at that time. The principal aim was to explore the extent and character of the remains and establish the chronology of their use(s). A total area of some 350m2 was systematically investigated. All deposits were dry sieved. The outlines of at least 3 structures were revealed, aligned and juxtaposed along an E-W axis (Fig. 88) . The largest is a -shaped burial enclosure. Its fa?ade faces S and is 16.5m /. as currently revealed. The 2 sides are probably different in length, the E side measuring 5.4m. Worked blocks of local limestone, with signs of advanced erosion, were used for the construction. The fa?ade is preserved to a h. of 4 courses. Three limestone cist graves, all plundered, were excavated in the W part of the interior (Fig. 89) . The E part of the interior appears to have been modified at a later date, probably for non-funerary purposes. Another structure built in a similar way, perhaps another burial enclosure of smaller dimensions, was partially investigated. Owing to the concentration of large fallen blocks towards the inside of the enclosure, only the surface was cleaned, and a single visible cist grave excavated. The area between the afore mentioned enclosures was also investigated. On present evidence, it seems that building materials and/or spolia from the enclosures were reused to demarcate an activity space of some kind. Further E of the structures mentioned above, 2 more plundered graves were cleaned. The construction technique both of the enclosures and of the 6 graves investigated, in conjunction with the scanty pottery and other artefacts recovered, points to their initial close chronological association in EHel times. The site probably served, perhaps intermittently and/or in part, as a burial complex until the LRom period, to judge from 8 coins found in one of the graves inside the largest enclosure. However, the large quantity of domestic handmade and wheelmade pottery, and the significant amount of animal bone found within the fill of the 2 enclosures and the area in between, suggest that at various times the limestone structures served non-funerary purposes. The burial enclosures at Ellinika form a rare example of this type of funerary monument in the interior of Epirus. The custom is most often associated with coastal cities such as Ambrakia, Leukas and Anaktorio. The continuing collaborative project will also aim to identify the organized settlement(s) associated with this cemetery. 88.

A high (but unspecified) number of MPal sites has been identified; these always lie above l,600masl and often above 2,000masl (the highest site found in 2008 is close to 2,012masl), often on mountain ridges (well above the tree line) and always in open-air locations close to sources of water and sometimes also flint. Many sites with MPal lithics are above the moraine deposits of the last glacial. Excavation was conducted at 5 sites identified in the survey. Attention is drawn to the association of MPal lithic technology with Neo and BA (MBA) pottery at certain sites. Spilaio, Monastery of the Dormition Publication: A.S.

On the hill immediately NE of the kiln lies a known Ar-EHel cemetery, with 2 more cemeteries in the neighbouring hills. The kiln was discovered in 1996 (ADelt 51 [1996], B2, 543) and systematically excavated in 2004. Sherds were scattered over a wider area, and it is possible that a further kiln and workshop installations remain to be discovered. The kiln was a 2-storeyed construction, with an underground furnace preserved almost intact and a firing chamber almost certainly above it, although this is now completely lost. The stomion is half-preserved, but only a few burnt bricks remain of the eschara, none in situ. The kiln is cut into the natural soil, is oriented NW-SE and its dimensions are 2.1m /. 1.8m w. 1.8m maximum preserved h. It has rounded corners, being more pear-shaped than rectangular. The furnace walls show some (surprisingly limited) exposure to high temperatures: in places they preserve traces of a clay lining. The support column for the eschara (0.8m /. 0.7m w. 0.36m maximum h.) is preserved in the centre of the furnace chamber (placing the kiln in Hasaki Type la). The support is made of handmade, sundried brick for the most part, with moulded bricks forming the straight sides. The stomion is protected by 2 flanking walls. No trace of the vaulted roof survives: two severely burnt masses of clay found nearby surely come from the kiln and may be part of the roof. A large quantity of mud-bricks, of different dimensions but with a curving profile, likely come from one or 2 courses of insulation of the chamber. The fill in the chamber contained a large quantity of sherds, mostly of domestic plainwares in 9 different shapes (oinochoai, ladles, amphorae, flour bins, pithoi and pithoid vessels, basins, hydriae, cups and a strainer), but also cooking pots, bg and red glazed wares. Parts of 3 kantharoi, 1 bolsal, 2 one-handled skyphoi, 1 deep skyphos and 2 uncharacterizable skyphoi were found. On the basis that these vessels are local products, the clays represented are described macroscopically, as is the technique of burnishing used on the plainwares and decoration with plastic bands and incision. The kiln structure itself cannot be used as a dating criterion. Dating rests on the pottery, and can only be given within the broad limits of the end of the 5th to the end of the 3rd Ct BC, although it is unlikely that the structure could have withstood use for more than 2-3 generations within that period. Archaeomagnetic analysis of samples of the kiln fabric indicates a date of 250-200 BC. After the kiln fell out of use, it was likely used as a dump for the waste of the workshop. Nomos of Pella (17th EPCA: 11th EBA) Pella. Eleftherotypia and Kathimerini (31/03/09) cite a report by M. Lilibaki-Akamati (Director, 17th EPCA) of the discovery of a potter's workshop at some distance from the main commercial centre of the city in the agora. The workshop, which remained in use from the last quarter of the 4th Ct until ca. 200 BC, is a square complex with a central paved courtyard containing a well and the base of an altar, surrounded by porticoes which have rooms leading off them. Kilns and storage areas were found, as well as a system of tanks for the purification of clay, thus providing important evidence for the technological processes employed. In addition, moulds for vessels, luxurious domestic equipment, fragments of figurines, and silver and bronze coins were found. Kathimerini (31/03/09) cites a report by I. Akamatis (Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki) of the discovery of the public archive of the city. Hundreds of seals and sealings from papyrus documents have been found, along with a gold stater, pens and ink holders, and raw materials for the production, sealing and storage of documents. The public archive did not</page><page sequence="58">58 CATHERINE MORGAN only hold the official papers of the Macedonian kingdom, its officials, the cities of the kingdom and their rulers, but was likely the location where these documents were written, signed and sealed. The archive was housed in a 2-storeyed building in the SW corner of the anc. agora, constructed in the L4th Ct BC over an extensive Cl cemetery (of the period of Archelaos and Amyntas) which contained mostly child burials equipped with rich grave goods. The building was destroyed in the earthquake which devastated the city at the beginning of the 1st Ct BC. Several hundreds of clay sealings from papyrus documents, which fell from the upper floor where they had been stored in the peristyle and S stoa, were recovered from the ruins. In the same areas were found several fragments of pens, metal and clay ink holders (one of which bore the name of Philip), and masses of the clay used to form sealings. Motifs depicted on the sealings vary: deities, male, female and animal forms, portraits and the Macedonian club and star. One group, which bears the legend E A , shows Pella personified as a female head wearing a mural crown. Other sealings show the head of Zeus with the legend of the Macedonian generals, in some cases of commercial magistrates and of the rulers of Edessa, Europos and various other cities. A number depict the image of a grazing cow, as used on the coinage of Pella: the legend on the coinage reads E / , whereas that above the cow on the sealings reads E E , thus linking it with the official organization of the commercial centre of the city, while emphasizing the fertility of the region and perhaps alluding to the old name of the city, Bounomos or Bounomeia. A seal type depicting the head of a satyr may have been used by officials inside the building as a guarantee of the confidentiality of the documents prepared there. Publication: A.S.

Kathimerini, Ta Nea, Eleftherotypia and To Vima (11/09/08) partially report a fuller Ministry of Culture press report (10/09/08) by P. and A. Chrysostomou (17th EPCA) of continuing excavation which has revealed a further 43 tombs, comprising 4 of the EIA (7th Ct to 580 BC), 31 of the Ar period (580-480) and 8 of the Cl-EHel period (480-279). The excavators note that the date of the earliest tombs indicates Macedonian settlement of the area by the 2nd half of the 7th Ct BC. Of the EHel graves, T714, the burial of a young girl, is of particular interest: this contained a gilded bronze wreath, 3 clay vases, a bronze kantharos and a unique life-sized terracotta head of the deceased girl. Of the Ar tombs, 20 were male burials and 11 the graves of women. Five of the male burials were in the 1st warrior category, 8 in the 2nd and 7 in the 3rd. Those in the 3rd category of warriors contained bronze helmets, iron weapons (a sword, 2 spearheads and a knife), gold, silver, bronze and iron ornaments (pins, rings, eye-, chest- and mouth-plates, sheet metal etc.), terracotta figurines, pottery and bronze vessels, and iron models of carts, furniture etc. Singled out for their wealth are 2 women's graves of the 3rd social rank, which contained gold, silver, bronze and iron jewellery (diadems, dress ornaments, spirals, earrings, mouth-plates, necklaces, pendants, pins, rings, bands and sheet metal etc.), glass, terracotta and faience beads, iron knives and iron models of carts, terracotta figurines and clay, glass and faience vessels. Some of the gold mouth-plates and sheet ornaments bear depictions of upstanding heraldic lions noted as symbols of royal power. Ceramics include Cor bf kraters, Atticizing kraters depicting animals and birds in the manner of the workshop of Lydos, which were mass produced in a workshop in the Chalkidike in the M6th Ct BC, and Attic bf kylikes. In 8 years of excavation since 2000, the 17th EPCA is reported as having uncovered a total of 915 graves over an area of ca. lha (estimated at 5% of the total area of the cemetery): of these, 231 date to the EIA, 441 to the Ar period and 236 to the Cl-Hel period, while 7 are undiagnostic.

Nomos of Imathia Vergina (anc. Aigai). Ta Nea (29/08/08), Eleftherotypia, Apogevmatini (30/08/08) and Kathimerini (02/10/08) cite a report by C. Saatsoglou-Paliadeli (Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki) of the discovery within anc. fill in the sanctuary of Eukleia of a gold wreath of oak leaves, of the same dimensions and technique as those in the royal tombs of the Megali Toumba and surely of the same 4th Ct date. The wreath, which lay over human bones, was contained within a solid gold vessel (a round, pyxis-like shape with a lid which so far appears unique), which was itself contained within a larger (ca. 0.5m h.) cylindrical bronze vessel, also with a lid. The discovery of such a funerary assemblage outside the area of the royal cemetery raises questions about the function of the agora itself. Questions centre on why a surely significant individual was buried with such wealth in the most public and most sacred spot within the city walls. Subsequent examination of the bone remains, reported in Ta Nea (31/03/09), indicates that they belong to a young male. Eleftherotypia, Kathimerini, Ta Nea and To Vima (05/12/08) report a lecture given by A. Kottaridou (17th EPCA) in which she presented a new reconstruction of the palace of Philip II made after an extensive programme of restudy, excavation and site conservation undertaken since April 2007. A 2-storeyed building is reconstructed (13.6m h.% facing E, with two 10 column stoas along the fa?ade (Doric on the lower level and Ionic on the upper), flanking a large central propylon. It covers an area of ca. 7,000m2, with the interior courtyard alone covering ca. 2,000m2 (and with 60 columns around the sides). There are indications that one of the stoas along the E fa?ade may have served as a pinakotheke. Andrones around the court included 3 large rooms (of ca. 250m2) capable of accommo dating some 30 couches each, plus several smaller rooms: the court and the rooms around it were all furnished with mosaic pavements of pebbles or marble tesserae in coloured plaster, with designs varying from the simple geometric to the complex figurative (for example, the Rape of Europa). The bottom 1.6m of the structure was built of limestone quarried from Vermio, ca.</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 59 15km away, with the superstructure in brick and covered in plaster made from a mixture of Theran earth (used here for the first time), lime and grit, with a variety of colours including blue, red and ochre. The marble threshold blocks of the entrance were preserved in situ; stone members collapsed from above, which imitate window shutters and Ionic columns, permit a full reconstruction of the fa?ade, including the 1st floor which must have held the women's and sleeping quarters. The roof was tiled in the Corinthian system. A separate block held the kitchens and related facilities. Construction began in 350 BC and is believed to have taken 10-12 years, forming part of a wider building programme under Philip II which also included, for example, the theatre. Dr Kottaridou develops a case for the identification of Pytheos as the architect of the building, noting comparisons with the Mausoleum at Halikarnassos and the Temple of Athena at Priene: the impact of Pythagorean mathematics on the design of the building is emphasized. CENTRAL MACEDONIA Nomos of Pieria (27th EPCA: 9th EBA) Adrianos, Rastro. S. Gimatzidis (27th EPCA) and R. Jung (DAI) report (PierikoiAntilaloi [11/04/08]) on a trial excavation on this extensive (ca. 1.4ha) multi-period hill settlement by the river Mavroneri (anc. Aison), close to Katerini. Three cemeteries probably related to this settlement are noted: one at Adrianos (Cl-Hel), another ca. 2-3km to the W (of the same period) and the third very close by, which is probably EIA in date. Excavation in the settlement revealed EBA activity in the lowest levels (on the basis of pottery, some datable to EHII, rather than architecture), followed by LBA (with handmade pottery of fine quality, burnished and matt-painted, although no evidence of production in the Myc tradition). Architectural remains appear in the EIA: in the lower part of the settlement, an artificial terrace (more than 0.5m d.) may have been intended to support large pithoi. Above this was a wall (of mud-brick on a stone foundation), inside which were found more than 10 loomweights. While the pottery found in these levels does not permit close dating, both the terrace and the wall can be generally characterized as LPGeo-SubPGeo. Scattered sherds indicate that activity continued in the later phases of the EIA, and the surface level (which lies directly over the LPGeo features) includes pottery and coins of the LAr-Hel period, when it seems that settlement was on a large scale. A very few Byz sherds and coins were also found. Finally, the authors note the chance discovery in 2005, during the opening of a water channel, of a closed EIA tomb assemblage at Moschochori, 5km W of the Kastro by the river Mavroneri. The burial was reported to be an extended inhumation, and to contain, in addition to a handmade kantharos, gold spirals and a large quantity of bronze jewellery (fibulae, beads, pendants and 3 bracelets). The assemblage has been handed over to the local authorities. Nomos of Thessaloniki (16th EPCA: 9th EBA) Thessaloniki, metro excavations A Ministry of Culture press release (11/09/08), which details progress to date on the excavation programme conducted by the 16th EPCA under the direction of L. Acheilara, is widely cited in the Greek press: see, for example, Eleftherotypia (28/09/08), To Vima, Ethnos and Apogevmatini (12/09/08). The following synopsis is drawn directly from this press release: the grave totals cited below thus update those given for the same sites in AR 54 (2007-2008), 74. Work is reported at: the Neos Sidirodromikos Stathmos (i.e. the metro station linked to the city's New Railway Station); the Sintrivani, Panepistimio and Eukleides metro stations; and the interchange for Sintrivani station which is located S of the central library of the Aristotelian University. In total, 1,414 tombs from the E and W cemeteries of the city have been uncovered since the start of excavation in 2007, of which 21.3% include grave goods; architectural remains (walls, water channels, floors and kilns) have also been found. Archaeological findings so far confirm the current under standing of the topography of anc. Thessaloniki as based on previous rescue excavations conducted by the 16th EPCA and on preparatory work for the metro. Neos Sidirodromikos Stathmos. Excavation initially focused on the E part of the station boundaries (an area of 1,350m2) and specifically on the area of the entry shaft for the tunnel-boring machine. Ninety four tombs were revealed, bounded to the by 4 distinct per?bolos walls oriented NW-SE, which were revealed at a d. of 3-5.5m beneath the mod. surface. A rich variety of tomb types was revealed (funerary monuments, built-chamber tombs, cist and pit graves, tile graves, enchytrismoi and altar-like structures of unworked stones which mark graves), which mostly contain inhumations, with a few instances of cremation and secondary reburial. Fifty eight of these contained ceramic or glass vessels, bronze coins, gold and bronze jewellery, gold danakes, and bone and metal artefacts. This part of the W cemetery was in use from the Hel LRom period. Excavation in this area is now complete. A further area of ca. 2,500m2 has been opened in the W part of the station area, at the front of the station forecourt. At a d. of 2-2.8m, 4 potters' kilns were found, with a dump area for broken tiles, wasters and discarded clay. This area, outside the W city wall, was known as the Potters' Field due to the presence of many ceramic workshops. (Further details are noted in Eleftherotypia [22/08/08], without attribution to source: the largest kiln, 5m /. and 3.5m w., is dated to the ECh period and described as used for the production of tiles and bricks; a smaller kiln nearby is dated to the 4th Ct AD.) Agia Sophia. Ta Nea (08/04/08) reports the decision by the Central Archaeological Council to rebury a mosaic pavement discovered close to this station. Sintrivani. Excavation took place in 3 areas, revealing tombs of the Hel-LRom period. During removal of the network of public utilities outside the station boundary, 109 tombs were uncovered, of different types (chamber tombs, tile graves, pit graves without covers, enchytrismoi, vaulted tombs, stone- or brick-built cists, altar like constructions of unworked stones which mark simple pits or orthogonal repositories and a group of 5 vaulted chambers). Inhumation is the dominant rite, though there are several instances of multiple inhumations, secondary reburial and cremation. Forty five tombs contained grave goods (pottery and glass vessels, bronze coins and gold danakes, terracotta figurines, bone pins, daggers, and gold and bronze jewellery). In the same area were found sections of wall and water channels. During construction of the perimeter wall of the station, in front of the Children's Refuge, a total of 178 tombs were found, of various types (chamber tombs, tile graves, pit graves, enchytrismoi, vaulted tombs, stone-built tombs, altar-like structures and cists), including 6 small monolithic marble</page><page sequence="60">60 CATHERINE MORGAN 90. Thessaloniki, metro excavations: Sintrivani station interchange, cemetery. sarcophagi or ossuaries of Rom date. Inhumation was the dominant rite, but there were also examples of double and multiple burials, secondary reburial and cremation. Seventy tombs contained grave goods (clay and glass vessels, bronze coins, gold, silver and bronze jewellery, and terracotta figurines). Part of a building with a mosaic pavement and partially preserved sections of wall and water channel were also recovered. The density of the tombs and the fact that they encroach on each other indicate the intensity of the use of this area over a long period of time, from the 3rd Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD. At the Sintrivani station interchange, S of the Aristotelian University library, an area of 2,842.75m~ was opened, revealing a total of 1,028 tombs, the most from any metro site (Fig. 90). Types include pits without covers, free burials, tile graves (in simple form or with cover tiles), cists, vaulted tombs and enchytrismoi. In addition, building materials from one construction and parts of others, and storage pits of mod. times were found. The most common forms of grave are free burials and pits either covered with schist slabs or uncovered. One hundred and twenty eight graves (12.5%) contained goods, consisting of clay vases and tear-bottles, bronze coins, bronze and gold jewellery, shells, bone and glass astragaloi, and iron and bronze items. The majority is Rom, but 35 items date to the Hel period. Among the Hel graves are noted: a stone ossuary ( 746) which held the burnt bones of a human and a small mammal, a gold wreath of oak leaves and a clay tear-bottle; and a cist grave 840 (previously reported in AR 54 [2007-2008], 74) which contained the remains of a wooden bier, plus 4 gold wreaths of olive leaves, jewellery, a gold danake, gold thread, a bronze coin, bronze mirror, and 1 bronze and 7 pottery vessels. At 2 further stations, work is in preliminary stages. At Panepistimiou station, work to move the network of public utilities was completed without encountering archaeological remains. At Eukleides station, between Constantinoupolis Street and Papanastasios Street, initial work to move the network of public services and sink 3 boreholes revealed partially preserved building remains of the LOt period and, in one of the boreholes, a marble architectural member. Landscaping of the general area of the work-site revealed part of a mod. building (walls and water pipes), probably a stable, of the L19th-E20th Ct. Angeloforos (01/02/09) reports the discovery by the 9th EBA at the Venizelos station, at a d. of 4.1m below the mod. surface, of MByz-LByz (12th to first half of the 15th Ct AD) levels containing building remains (floors, walls and wells) and much pottery. Thessaloniki, city centre Eleftheros Typos (05/08/08) and Ta Nea (06/08/08) report analyses conducted by C. Papageorgopoulou (Zurich) on the body of a woman in a sarcophagus dating to ca. 300 AD, discovered in 1962 in the E cemetery of the city. The body, of a tall woman 50-60 years old and of high status (covered by a purple-dyed, gold-ornamented silk cloth), was embalmed using a mixture of resin, myrrh, olive and aromatic substances - the earliest attestation of this practice in Greece. The body was then placed in cotton and linen wrappings and laid on a wooden palette inside the sarcophagus. Shreds of skin, hair, reddish eyebrows, arm muscle etc. are preserved in very fragile condition, in addition to the skeleton.</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 61 Thessaloniki, E. of centre Thessaloniki, Toumba. S. Andreou (Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki) presents an overview of continuing study following excavations which took place between 1984 and 1998, and again from 2006-2008. The goal of the latter phase of excavation was a close understanding of the settlement from the end of the BA and the transition to the EIA. Study of old excavation material revealed that the earliest occupation on the slopes of the Toumba spans the MH period (building phases 14-9) and is characterized by monochrome pottery in a significant variety of shapes. With the start of the LH (phases 8-6), settlement was confined to the upper terraces, and the pottery enriched with a small number of decorated vases (with incised decoration in phase 7 and in phase 6, incised and matt-painted examples and one LHII Myc sherd). Primary studies of the pottery are: K. Psaraki, a a a e a : e e a e a a a e a (PhD thesis, Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki 2004; http://cds.lib.auth.gr//archive.shtml?base= Griza&amp;id=gri-2004-444); S. Andreou and K.

Proceedings of the International Symposium 'Strymon Prehistoricus\ 27 September to 10 October 2004. Blagoevgrad (Sofia, Gerda Henkel Stiftung 2007), 397-420. The plan of the settlement on the top of the Toumba (Fig. 91), with narrow cobbled streets between multi-roomed mud brick complexes, remained stable throughout the later stages of the LBA (phase 2A). LHIIIB wheelmade vessels remained few in phase 5, but wheelmade pottery was much more common in phases 4-2A (LHIIIC E and M in the 4 subphases of phase 4, LHHIC M and L and perhaps SubMyc in phases 3 and 2B, and EPGeo with concentric circle decoration in phase 2A).

Thessaloniki, Toumba: the settlement on top of the tell.</page><page sequence="62">62 CATHERINE MORGAN From 2006 onwards, excavation focused on uncovering building complexes and E on the E part of the hill, of which only small parts were previously known. The aim was a better understanding of changes in the organization of the settlement and in these particular complexes during phases 4-2A, via comparison between the 2 new buildings and complex A, which was almost completely excavated between 1985 and 1998 (this consists of more than 15 rooms and covers an area of some 230m2). A further aim of this excavation was better under standing of the transition to the EIA through the location of stratified assemblages of phases 3, 2B and 2A, which are rare or completely absent from complex A and the other areas of the previous excavations. Non-joining parts of well-built stone foundations which are associated with fill containing Ar and Cl pottery, domestic material and animal bone, although with no secure link to particular floor levels, were partially uncovered in the surface level. This appears to be the abandonment and destruction layer of 2 or 3 houses which were built during the 2nd half of the 6th Ct and into the M5th Ct. An irregularly shaped pit (maximum di. 5m, d. 1.5m), which was perhaps intended to hold material with which to make brick for later houses, destroyed older walls and fills back to the end of the LBA in the SE part of building B. It contains building material and pottery of the end of the 5l and the E4th Cts. The walls of the Ar and Cl periods sit directly on, or have partially destroyed, the walls and fills of the later phases of complexes and E, complexes which are bounded on 3 sides by roads which divide them from each other and from the other buildings located to the S and (Fig. 91). The building techniques, and the extent and spatial organization of complexes and E (to date, 7 and 11 rooms or spaces, respec tively, have been excavated), show similarities with complex A. Successive rebuilding, floors and stratified fills of the end of the LBA and beginning of the EIA have been located in both complexes (phases 2A-4A). 92. Thessaloniki, Toumba: grave offerings from the pithos burial ii The fills associated with the latest construction phase of the foundations of complex are disturbed. However the floors in rooms B7-B9 are preserved (ca. 2.15-2.20m */.), as well as part of the fill of the immediately preceding phase, which is linked to the first appearance of several EPGeo closed vessels and skyphoi decorated with concentric circles (phase 2A), the presence of bone and stone tools, and the debris of stoneworking. A large pithos stood in situ in room B9 and room B7 contained traces of constructions for heating. Remains of this period were less well preserved in rooms B2-B4, which had previously been partially excavated. A floor of the immediately preceding phase (2B) with LHIIIC L wheelmade pottery, which can be easily distin guished in rooms B2/3 of the older excavations, was traced only in area B9. This is due to the fact that in the course of phase 3, the NW part of the building complex (B9) was demolished and reused only in the 2nd half of phase 2B (traces of use are found at a d. of ca. 2.5m). Notable fills of phase 3 (floors at a d. of ca. 3.3m) have so far been located only in the S part of the building (B4), where 2 very regular shallow pits probably indicate the existence of 2 more baskets next to one of which traces were clearly visible in the 1990 excavation, plus a pithos which remained in position from phase 4. A notable quantity of fragmentary murex shells, which must be linked to the production of purple dye in B2/3, complete the picture from the older excavations of phase 3. For a study of this dye production, see R. Veropoulidou, S. Andreou and K. Kotsakis, 'Small scale purple-dye production in the Bronze Age of Northern Greece: The evidence from the Thessaloniki Toumba', in C. Afrano and L. Karali (eds), Vestidlos, Textiles y Tintes.

Large pithos sherds and red clay also covered and went partially under the skeleton of an adolescent male which had been carefully placed, extended, face down, and with the arms by the sides, partially in the opening in the wall of the room and partially in the road outside. The deceased, who was perhaps placed inside a pithos, was accompanied by a spondylus shell, a whetstone and 2 LBA handmade vessels (Fig. 92), while a bronze knife which was found slightly further inside the room could also belong to the same assemblage. The burial was probably placed here and covered with clay at the end of phase 3 or at some point in phase 2B, in the course of which the part of building seems to have been unused. Excavation continued down further into the fills of phase 4 only in the unexcavated parts of rooms B2/3 and B4. To the significant number of pithoi located in rooms Bl and B2/3, should be added one more in B2/3 and one in B4. Only fills of phases 3 and 4 were preserved in building complex E, since the more recent levels had been destroyed by Ar and Cl construction. The fills and floor of phase 3, with LHIIIC M pottery, were themselves partially disturbed by more recent building activity, while it is likely that part of the complex was abandoned in phase 2B. There was a bin or basket in E8, while quantities of fragmentary murex shells, part of a metallurgical crucible and traces of burning in room E3 are associated with the production of purple dye and with metal working inside the complex, similar to those activities located in other buildings. See M. Vavelidis and S. Andreou, 'Gold and gold working in Late Bronze Age northern Greece', Naturwissenschaften 95 (2008), 361-66. The beginning of phase 3 and phase 4A are characterized by particularly intense activity, with many and frequent relaying of floors. To phase 4 belongs a structure made of stone slabs with a flat top which may be linked to food production (B9) and an oven (B7) which continued in use into phase 3 and is associated with a thick layer of ash rich in archaeobotanical remains. In the E part of the complex, which had been partially excavated previously, there is a striking presence of storage spaces with quite large pithoi in situ. From this view, building complexes E and reinforce the picture of centralized, large-scale storage which is plain in building complex A in phase 4, but which stands in contrast to the small-scale and dispersed storage of phases 3,2B and 2A in the 2 recently excavated complexes.

The site lies at the source of the river Angitis (the W tributary of the Strymon river), in the S foothills of Mt Falakrou, 25km W of Drama and at an elevation of 129m. The cave is an almost horizontal, gallery-like karst formation, estimated at 9-12km /., which widens occasionally into chambers and through which the river Angitis flows. Traces of sporadic human occupation have been located in the first chamber, through which the complex is entered: 2 small steps were cut in the SE area. The PH fill covered an area of ca. 100m2, to an average d. of 0.3m. Four round hearths, located on 2 small level areas and bounded with unworked limestone blocks, were foci of human activity. Small pits for ash and rubbish were associated with them. In total, 3,456 sherds, 9 terracotta weights, an undecorated miniature vessel, 757 animal bones of domesticated and wild species, 4 tools and items of shell ornament, and a necklace of wild-boar teeth were found. The pottery is mostly monochrome (with burnished, smoothed and incised surface treatment), thick-walled and made of local clay. Mostly household shapes are represented: the monochrome wares divide into shallow open (35.7%), deep open (4.5%), open storage shapes (47.6%) and closed vessels (9.2%). Only ca. 1% of the pottery bears painted, linear decoration (3 rims of open vessels, a handle of a closed shape and 23 body sherds of open and closed shapes). One sherd of an open light-on-dark ware vessel was found. Ceramic shapes and painted decoration show influences from a wide area, from the Danube, Aegean Thrace, the plain of Drama, the Strymon valley and as far as E Thessaly. Pottery indicates seasonal occupation from the LNeo/FNeo-EH period. Nomos of Kavala (18th EPCA: 12th EBA) Krinides. Apogevmatini (04/07/08) cites a report by T. Salonikios (18th EPCA) of the discovery, in the course of the construction of an extension to the water supply network to the village of Krinides, of 5 unlooted Rom tombs, plus funerary monuments which had been opened and some Byz artefacts. The tombs are cist graves with tile covers. The site lies close to anc. Philippoi: the mod. village of Krinides is built over the anc. city of the same name. Dikili Tash. P. Darcque (EfA/CNRS) and Ch. Koukouli Chrysanthaki (ASA) report on the first season of a 3rd programme of collaborative excavation, which aims to bring together information enabling reconstruction of the birth of the tell in the Neo period and its evolution into mod. times. During this first campaign, research was confined to 3 sectors where new findings could be obtained to answer the main research questions posed (Fig. 93).</page><page sequence="64">64 CATHERINE MORGAN At the foot of the S slope of the tell, a first intervention aimed to trace the possible limit of the PH settlement. Under the hillwash, stones appeared in the S part of the trench, mixed with LNeo and EBA sherds and bones: these look more like a mass of fallen rocks than a continuation of the weathering discovered during the 2nd programme of excavation. It is possible that the preserved limits of the tell lie here. Part of a Neo vase decorated with an applied anthropomorphic figure was discovered in this sector (Fig. 94). In sector 6, it was hoped to reveal the continuation of house 1 (LNeo II) as well as levels of the LNeo-EBA transition. Apart from the unexpected discovery of a silver tetradrachm of Alexander III (struck in the royal mint of Amphipolis between 315-294 BC), the continuation of house 1 appeared in the location expected, covered by a thick destruction layer, recog nizable from the colour of the burnt daub. This lay under the EBA level which produced a hearth as well as silos, the walls of which were covered with a white coating. In the SW of the excavated area, lying on a hearth, was an intact, two-headed zoomorphic figurine, ca. 0.2m /. (Fig. 95). The type is rare both at Dikili Tash and in the Aegean world in general, and the discovery of such an item in situ is exceptional. In sector 7, close to the top of the tell, the main objective was to explore the possible successor to a LBA house discovered in this area. But before reaching this house, excavation in sector 7 exposed a sequence of occupation levels of this period which produced abundant finds: several bronze objects, including the complete blade of a small dagger, and a fragment of a cup with painted decoration imitating a Myc type (the first discovered at Dikili Tash). LBA occupation was thus not a short episode in the life of the PH settlement, but had several phases, lending it a rather different historical signifi cance than hitherto recognized. Publication: H.

THASOS (18th EPCA: 12th EBA) Area of the Artemision. A. Muller (EfA/Lille 3), E Blond? (EfA/CNRS) and S. Dadaki (12th EBA) report on an excavation season conducted in collaboration with the 12th EBA, the 18th EPCA and the University of Athens. Excavation focused on an extensive EByz residence which has been explored in stages since 1971: this structure suffered severe disturbance in ca. 570 and was finally destroyed in 619 or slightly later (Fig. 96). In the triclinium of the E wing, the fill laid down just before the final destruction was excavated; this held 2 heaps of fragments of a pebble pavement in opus signinum. The extent of the neighbouring courtyard was explored only in a narrow strip. Two installations were discovered which were used 95. Dikili Tash: LNeo II 2-headed zoomorphic figurine, found on a hearth. successively during the last phase of occupation: a large built vat of uncertain function was largely covered by a large domestic oven which was relatively well preserved. The most important part of the season's work was conducted in the wing (Fig. 97). Beyond the corner room, the wing is formed of a row of 4 rooms of different sizes and appearances. The 2 W rooms are distinguished by the richness of their decor. Room 20 has a pavement of white pebbles set in red-tinted mortar. Its central decorative area, in opus spicatum crossed by two diagonals, had at the centre a mosaic emblema now lost; all round, a large border included, in front of the entrance, a doormat of wine-coloured pebbles. The corner room (21) is exceptional as much for its size (6.3m 9.3m) as for the richness of its decor: the W part was paved with mosaic and with marble slabs at the foot of the walls, and in the E part it is at least possible to detect the treatment of the wall, which had a yellow surface treatment. For the first time in this sector it was possible to identify remains of reoccupation of the site after a long period of abandonment. In the area of room 20, there was an Ot workshop, perhaps a lime-burning establishment, consisting of a pit and two summarily built kilns. The level containing these kilns held plentiful evidence for the existence of a potter's workshop in the area, also of the Ot period. In addition to the many architectural members from the residence, notable discoveries include a fragment of an acroterion depicting a running peplophoros, found in 1983 in the S area, a Hel female head and, especially, a Rom relief (1.1m /*.), the iconography of which is heroic in character (Fig. 98). The macellum. J.-Y. Marc (EfA/Strasbourg) reports on the 2008 study season. The identification of a glass manufacturer's workshop in room 57 was confirmed by finds including numerous fragments of unworked glass, blowing tubes and wasters. The presence of a bronze workshop in room 54 is also confirmed by finds including numerous mould fragments, remains of furnace wall, crucible fragments and many pieces of slag; the presence of many forging slags also indicates that iron working took place here.</page><page sequence="66">66 CATHERINE MORGAN 4*134?

Koutsouflakis (EMA) who, together with the divers A. and I. Kouvela, undertook a preliminary survey of a site off the coast of the village of Glyfada, Mesi, which had been reported to the Archaeological Service by a local resident. A hoard of EBA bronze tools was located and subsequently retrieved 450m from the coast and at a d. of 3.5m, concentrated in an area no greater than 10m2. One hundred and ten tools had been identified at the time of writing, with more remaining to be disengaged from the mass in which they were found. These are almost exclusively percussion tools, especially a type of double axe with 2 percussion surfaces which occurs in 3 different sizes. The presence of lath-hammers and single bladed axes is attested in smaller numbers, as well as fragments of tools of unidentified type. Below the tools, sunk down into the sea bed, were 2 bases of EH vessels, which probably contained the hoard: mat impressions were also found in a mass of bronze. This is the largest EH hoard of tools so far found in Greece or the neighbouring Balkans. There is no evidence at present to link it with a shipwreck nor are there settlement remains nearby. The details of the context combine to indicate that the hoard was most probably deliberately concealed in a coastal location which was then on dry land. In addition to providing information about metalworking styles and techniques in the S Balkans during the EBA, this discovery also promises to shed light on the physical development of this area of coast. 98.

Greco (Director, SAIA) reports on continuing excavation on the Lazaridis plot, S of the Isthmus wall, in the vicinity of the funerary enclosure (Fig. 99). A rectangular strip was excavated, the long side of which was perpendicular to the boundary wall. The edge of the trench is defined by the exterior wall of a LRom house, the walls of which obliterated the fortification wall. There were 2 phases of monumental construction. The later is represented by a short section of the foundation of a large wall; the earlier consists of a building complex, the so-called Lazaridis building, uncovered in 2005. Investigation in 2008 served to clarify several structural aspects of the W side of the building. Besides the discovery of the complete partition wall between the already known room and a new adjoining room C, the floor of C was traced. A collapse deposit related to the support structure of the room provides pottery from the L6th and E5th Cts BC. In addition, trench 6 was extended to the E: this trench was opened in 2006 in one of the Byz rooms built within the 'late' curtain wall. Work has now reached the W boundary of the house. A further trench was opened in the E part of the House of the Columns, in order to expose the structure. In the north ernmost part of the trench, the SE corner of a room appeared, the threshold of which was preserved on the E side. The Ar wall ran immediately to the S. Investigation focused on the area between the Ar and Mate' walls, where in the E part the SE corner of the House of the Columns was exposed. At a considerable depth in the central part of the trench a level of collapse was investigated, and two final layers recognized which slope markedly from to S, following the slope of the terrain. Investigation in area 18 was aimed at the chronological and stratigraphical understanding of the wall on the summit of Hephaestia, along the promontory SE of the peninsula of Palaiopolis, in particular at the point where the NE tower is set against the defensive circuit. Excavation in area 26 (the Alteras plot) was completed (Fig. 100). It proved possible to identify 4 phases of occupation: settlement dating back to the 7th Ct BC, urbanization of the district in the 5l -4th Ct BC, construction of a house with a central courtyard in the 4th Ct BC and a final renovation in the 6th Ct AD. Restoration was completed of the funerary enclosure of the end of the 4th Ct BC, the so-called pyrgos (excavated in 1930), as well as that of the wall behind this monument.</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 69 100.

Williams (Canadian Institute/British Columbia) reports on continuing work in the castle of Mytilene. Museum study focused on preparation for the publication of pottery, lamps and figurines. Work on Rom pottery groups (J. Hayes) included examination of material from the 1960-1961 Nikomedia Street excavations (directed by S. Charitonides), which includes the latest forms of ?andarli ware (E4th Ct AD) of which hundreds of examples were also found in the Gr Canadian excavations of 1986-1990. Work on Aeolic grey wares (V. Lungu and R Dupont) continued: nearly 2 dozen new forms of grey finewares have been discovered from the 5th Ct BC levels, a period little known elsewhere. Excavation under the direction of A.-C. Loupou (Director, 14th EBA) revealed a much disturbed probable Med Ch cemetery on the central terrace of the castle under remains of an 18th Ct Ot building, perhaps a house, which had been destroyed in the great earthquake of February 1867. The Ot structure lay under a completely rebuilt Ot building of the later 19th Ct. Coins of the 1870s indicate the date. Nearby, a second trench uncovered a possible road and a mass of kitchen debris buried after the same earthquake, which included glassware, plates, cups, cutlery, etc., useful evidence for the material culture of M 19th Ct Ot Mytilene. There was also at least one undisturbed Augustan context (to judge from the pottery recovered).

The torso is 1.2m h. and is preserved from the knees to the neck; the left arm only survives, holding a himation. In addition, a bearded male head was found (0.36m h. and 0.3m w.)\ it is as yet unclear whether it is part of the same statue as the torso. These pieces had been reused as building material within the W extension of the harbour wall (parallel to the coastline) which would, in antiquity, have been on dry land. They were found at a d. of 2.5m. In addition, 4 marble stelae (ca. lm /.) have been located, and it is possible that the head relates to one of these. A stone crown-block from the bastion of the wall was lifted (this has a triangular profile 1.2m 0.4m).

The d. of the fill varied from 0.1-0.9m, according to the profile of the bedrock: finds were many and varied, but mostly sherds and tools for day-to-day activities. Pottery included tablewares, i.e. bowls of various types, conical cups with mat or leaf impressions on the base, 2-handled beakers and bell-shaped cups. Larger vessels for the storage and transport of foodstuffs include kadoi, small pithoi and larger ones with plastic or incised decoration, amphorae with incised decoration on the handles and large prochoes with cylindrical necks. A third category of vessel is cooking equipment, chiefly the basin shaped hearths which were built directly into the ground. Other shapes represented in sherd form include kernoi, small kraters with burnished, impressed or incised decoration, and pyxides. Imported vessels from Siphnos, Melos and Thera continue to be found, confirming communication and trading connections between the islands. In addition to pottery, finds include obsidian blades and unworked pieces of obsidian, stone grinders and rubbers, and a small spool-shaped rubber made of bone. Evidence of the diet of the inhabitants of the settlement is provided by shells and ovicaprid bones. The acropolis is shown to be the site of an organized settlement, with roofed dwellings containing the necessary equipment and foodstuffs for daily life. Sherds of 2-handled beakers and bell-shaped cups were also found in the previous excavation campaign conducted in the 1960s, in the settlement immediately below the crescent-shaped wall, indicating that the summit wall dates to the L stages of ECycII. In addition, the pithoi with incised decoration, which had been thought to appear at the start of the MCyc period, are now seen to begin earlier. Delos Sanctuary of Apollo. R. Etienne (Ef A/Paris 1) reports that, in addition to continued cataloguing of stray blocks, work in 2008 had 2 main objectives. Architectural study encompassed work on the periboloi of the Apollo sanctuary and the evolution of sacred space, restoration of the smaller monuments in the sanctuary, a new reconstruction of the pillar-shaped base GD 14, research on votive monuments with one or more columns and restoration of the largest quadrangular tripod base known at Delos (the original position of which remains unknown). This can be categorized as a new conception of the sanctuary during the Hel period, with a substantial number of votive columns which could exceed 10m h. as well as the pillars which stood along the sacred way or on the large bases along the Stoa of the Naxians. The second aim was an electromagnetic survey of the sanctuary. The resulting plans, which cover an area of ca. 8.5ha, will be compared and combined with the data from the coring and resistivity survey conducted in 2007 to trace the anc. shoreline. The result will be a 3-D reconstruction of the coastal zone. Heraion. H. Sarian (EfA/ S?o Paolo) reports on the 2008 excavation season (Fig. 102). The most important results came from exploration of the terrace W of the Heraion: here parts of 2 walls (X and Y), which run parallel N-S, had been discovered in 1964, along with a layer containing Geo sherds. Renewed excavation revealed that these walls continue S and of the W terrace. The westernmost wall lies under the per?bolos of temple II, for which it serves as a foundation. Although it disappears towards the SW, its NE angle has been recovered. Wall Y is at a significantly greater depth, in the Geo layer noted above. At both the S and N, it makes an angle and continues to the E. Wall Y was very likely the per?bolos for the first stage of temple I. The associated layer is full of sherds, including LGeo fragments. Vessels of this period have already been recovered from the sanctuary's votive deposit. The earliest level in the sanctuary, until recently dated to 700 BC, should therefore be set back to the LGeo period (750-725 BC). Aphrodision of Stesileos. C. Durvye (EfA) reports on excavation undertaken to clarify the chronology and articula tion of buildings within this complex. Excavation between the E wall of the temple and the corner of oikos 2 provides the first archaeological date for the temple. This confirms the hypothesis that the temple was built to house the statue dedicated by Stesileos, which first appears in the accounts of the Hieropes in 304 BC. Excavation within the ramp between oikoi 2 and 3 showed that the bedrock was high at this point, thus explaining the difference in level between the E part of the sanctuary and the temple court, separated by a rock ridge. Ceramic evidence</page><page sequence="72">72 CATHERINE MORGAN indicates that all of the fills revealed in this trench are later than 150 BC. The fills which formed a ramp in front of the doorway of oikos 2 covered a ditch running under wall 21 in which were found 93 fragments of terracotta figurines (draped, body fragments, fish, bases with moulded decoration and one fragment of a plaque depicting a seated female in bas relief). Pottery from this ditch dates the fill to the Hel period. A sondage inside oikos 4 revealed that the fills which supported the floor of the oikos (which post-date 150 BC) rest on traces of previous occupation with, in particular, a 3rd Ct BC sequence resting on a still older sequence which goes back to the 6th Ct BC. The division of space was different during the oldest phase: 3 walls were discovered within the sondage. Cleaning was undertaken in oikos 5 before the laying of concrete paving to support the stray blocks of the temple. A jumbled destruction and abandonment horizon was distin guished which covered, in irregular fashion, the 3 floors. On these floors was abundant material, including storage vessels, cooking equipment, pottery and lamps, which will sustain a general study of the furnishing of a room probably used as a hestiatorion at the end of the 2nd Ct BC. 'Chapel' of Dionysos. J.-C. Moretti and M. Fincker (EfA/CNRS) report on a study of the erroneously-termed 'Chapel' of Dionysos (cat. 81 in the Guide de D?los), a monument infamous for the restoration on each side of a base bearing a phallus. Examination of the physical remains and inscriptions associated with the monument lead to its identifi cation as an altar of a type derived from the altar in antis. This was dedicated to Dionysos in the first decades of independence (more precisely, ca. 280 BC) (Fig. 103). 103. Delos: Altar of Dionysos from the SW. Atlas of Delos. J.-C. Moretti (EfA/CNRS) et al. report that the 2008 season was largely devoted to the preparation of comple mentary information to the general plan.

To Vinta, Apogevmatini and Ta Nea (18/03/09) report the results of excavation conducted by P. Hatzidakis (21st EPCA) as part of a cleaning operation to remove old excavation spoil along the Street of the Lions. A Hel manufacturing and commercial quarter was discovered on the E side of the street. This included a workshop for the manufacture of metal figurines; a painter's workshop, with remains of paints, palettes and fragments of figures, including a well-preserved copy of the Aphrodite Ourania of Pheidias on which traces of colour are preserved; and shops selling bread and wine, including a bakery in which the oven and the base of a mill of Santorini lava were preserved. Slightly further on were found gold earrings, a medallion and necklaces dating from the E 1st Ct BC, products of a local goldsmith. A rare find for this period is an engraved gold bead bearing the word 'eirene'. Opposite, close to the palaistra, was a shop selling perfumed oil. The entire area bore evidence of the 2 cata strophic fires attested in 69 and 88 BC. On the Terrace of the Lions were found a large quantity of Hel pottery, 2 deposits of cooking vessels, as well as sherds of older Cor and Cyc vessels, and a purple-dyer's shop. Publication: V.

Kavos: work on the Special Deposit South was completed, with the stratigraphie study and removal of a number of baulks. The excavation of 3 outlying 4m 4m squares confirmed that the extremities of the deposit had been reached. A sample of 20% of all excavated soil was again water sieved, further confirming the absence of human remains or workshop debris. Immediately S, in the small caves and cavities below the Special Deposit South, the area of trench A again yielded traces of human bone. Excavation in the Middle Area, between the Special Deposits South and North, revealed some simple walls of local metamorphosed limestone, but very little accompa nying cultural material. Contrary to earlier indications, no evidence for ECyc settlement was discovered in the Middle Area of the Kavos site. Dhaskalio: survey of the islet was completed, along with a catalogue of all visible surface features on Dhaskalio (numbering 146) and at Kavos (42) (Figs 104, 105). This was aided by ground-controlled helicopter photography (Department of Rural Survey and Engineering, Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki), and kite and pole photography (C. Gaston). Photomosaic coverage for both Dhaskalio and Kavos was achieved, and on this basis orthophotographic coverage (and a digital terrain model) at a scale of 1:500 will soon be available. Investigation of the massive terrace wall identified in 2007 was completed. Excavation focused on the summit area where a substantial structure, ca. 16m /. and running N-S along the spine of the summit, was unearthed (Fig. 106). This is the most substantial building yet found in an ECyc settlement. A hoard of 3 copper or bronze axes was found in a small room at the S end (Fig. 107): a solid flat axe or chisel, 0.222m /. and weighing 35 lg; an axe-adze, 0.196m /. and weighing 637g; and a shaft-hole axe, 0.101m /. and weighing 139g. Immediately S of this main building on the summit was a roughly circular enclosure, di. 2.4m, with an opening to the S. During its later use, this was the locus of deposition of more than 300 rounded limestone beach pebbles. These did not come from the nearby beach at Dhaskalio Kavos, but were probably collected from Ano Kouphonisi. Study of the pottery indicates that settlement at Dhaskalio and the beginning of deposition in the Special Deposit South should both be dated to the early phase of the Keros-Syros</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 50m 104.

Pending the results of C14 analysis, the chronology established at Markiani on Amorgos places this phase (Dhaskalio phase A) at ca. 2800-2500 BC. The buildings on the summit were begun during this phase and reconstructed during phase B, which, on the basis of imports of the so-called 'Kastri Group', dates to ca. 2500-2200 BC. The later use and abandonment of these buildings falls in phase C, which, on the basis of imports which include sherds of the Phylakopi I culture, dates late in the ECyc, provisionally ca. 2200-2000/ 1900 BC. The settlement at Dhaskalio is currently the largest known from the ECyc period at ca. 7,000m2. It housed a wide range of activities, including the production of obsidian tools (studied by T. Carter and M. Milic). Examination of the ground-stone tools (Y. Rowan) indicates a rather restricted range. Figurine finds include several marble examples (and perhaps one lead) of what may now be considered the Dhaskalio variety of the schematic figurines of the Keros-Syros period. These are of fine white marble, and in some cases are complete. Yet, so far, Dhaskalio has produced no examples of the folded-arm figurines so common (but always broken) in the Special Deposit South at Kavos. Study continues of metallurgical activity (M. Georgakopoulou), the sources of imported pottery (J. Hilditch) and the sources of the marble for the marble objects found (Y Maniatis with D. Tambakopoulos). The use of the various</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 75 structures is being examined via soil micromorphology (C. French with S. Taylor) and the study of phytoliths (L. Zorzos). Analysis of plant remains (E. Margariti) has revealed cereals, vine and olive: study of animal bones and marine shells is pending. Finally, work continues on the human remains from trench A on Kavos and from a deposit containing burnt human bone on Dhaskalio (I. Moutafi). 107. Dhaskalio: axes from hoard. Amorgos Arkesini. Further work at the LCI tower residence was undertaken by the ASA in 2007 and 2008 (Ergon [2008], 92 97). The plan of the structure, and details of its construction and the function of rooms, was revealed, with the clearance of extraneous architectural remains (worked and unworked blocks). The numerous portable finds consisted mostly of pottery, lamps, household equipment, coins, iron nails and lead clamps. A 2nd inscription (noting previously Ergon [2006], 64, pi. 65) was found SE of the tower, cut into a large unworked stone: it is a 3rd Ct hows inscription of at least 15 lines which makes reference to the house, the garden and its dependencies. Thera Akrotiri. C. Doumas (ASA) reports (Ergon [2008], 112-18) on a further study season and continuing conservation of the wall-paintings. Work on the Panel of the Large Spirals was completed. Study of the MCyc pottery was concluded, with the intention of proceeding to speedy publication. Additionally, pottery studies focused on material from building B, from sector A and on imports of the LCyc period. Petrographical and chemical analyses were undertaken on the pottery to provide data on technological change between the ECyc and MCyc periods, and for the study of the techniques of manufacture and use of cooking vessels of the ECyc, MCyc and LCyc periods. Study continued of the mostly inorganic pigments which have so far been found on some 500 utensils: local preparation and use of red and yellow pigments of lead oxide (lithargyros) and of white from cerusite (white lead) or hydrocerusite. The identification of riebeckite makes it almost certain that one of the blue colours which were used in the wall paintings was produced on site. The large quantity of pulverized quartz and pieces of faience paste found at Akrotiri demonstrate the probability that the many and varied faience objects found here were products of a local workshop. Study of the obsidian found in the cuttings for the supports for the new roof proceeds, with some 18,457 pieces catalogued. Study of the osteological material has filled out the picture of the wildlife of PH Thera; a significant proportion of the remains belong to small animals, especially rodents. Phytoliths indicate the use of papyrus plants of the genus cyperaceae, known to have been used in anc. Egypt for the manufacture of rope, baskets etc. Publication: C. Doumas, A A a a a e a 1967-1997.

Readings on the Economy and Trade Routes (Athens, National Hellenic Research Foundation 2008). Publications of new primary data from the Cyclades and the Dodecanese, especially numismatic, are included in a collection of synthetic essays of wide general interest. Agathonisi P. Triantaphyllidis (22nd EPCA) offers a full account of the antiquities of the island (AAA 39 [2006], 175-92), including material previously noted in print. New discoveries are noted below. Anc. Tragaia. P. Triantaphyllidis (22nd EPCA) reports (AAA 39 [2006], 181-83; expanded in an account cited in To Vima [20/04/08]) his discovery in 2001, and systematic excavation from 2006, of an EHel-ERom fortified settlement at Kastraki, overlooking the bay of Maistros. The associated anc. port now lies below sea level, adjacent to the E wall of the fortification. The , E and W sides of the hill were fortified: an area of ca. 0.5ha lies within the walls. The site was fortified in the EHel period (L4th-E3rd Ct BC). The walls, which form an orthogonal shape ca.lOOm 30m (h. 1-1.5m, d. as reported post excavation 1.8-2m.), are built from limestone extracted from a local anc. quarry. Dating rests on the construction technique (pseudo-isodomic with smaller stones plugging gaps) and on finds including Attic and Pergamene bg pottery, and many silver and bronze coins of Miletos. The fortified area was arranged in terraces, with traces of excavated steps evident at the W edge of the fortification. Changes in the building scheme occurred during the 2nd and 1st Cts BC, a period of great instability in the Aegean. A rare find, which may be linked with the putting down of piracy, is part of a stamped inscription or decree on a terracotta roof tile (L2nd-Elst Ct BC). This refers to a military victory, possibly in the harbour of Tragaia: e / / e / e &lt;; e/ / $. The tile likely comes from a public building possibly erected to commemorate the victory. Excavation here continues. Finds to date include: terracotta figurines of kourotrophoi, ram-bearers, and animals and birds (for example, eagles), a quantity of metal objects such as a lead cover for a box and bronze fittings for household equipment and furniture, inscribed sherds and many architectural terracottas. These likely belong to the apothetes of a Hel sanctuary (probably a road-side shrine, since the location is close to the city gate). Further S, outside the fortification, a system of cisterns is probably connected to wells. A large water cistern, 3.5m d. and 4m di., cut into the bedrock and lined with waterproof cement, was investigated on the upper terrace of the settlement. Important evidence for its date, and for that of the settlement, is provided by a deposit containing a large quantity of LHel and ERom household pottery, such as amphorae, beehives, basins, cookpots, red-slipped plates and lamps (many of which bear dedicatory inscriptions to Zeus Lykios on the base). Some 3,000 fragmentary vessels have been found, most of which were locally manufactured (the discovery of a terracotta potter's wheel is noted). The significance of honey production is evident. Residue analysis is being conducted on a sample of the beehives at NCSR Democritos. Purple dye was also produced on Agathonisi. Excavation has revealed part of a workshop for pigments and dyes, located on the fringes of the settlement. Two tanks were found, connected to each other by an overflow system, and, in them, large quantities of sea shell, much of which had been stored in a stone trough inside one of the tanks. These shells included a large proportion of murex brandaris from which deep purple red dye is extracted. Several deposits of this type of shell, as well as shells of other gastropods, were found inside and around the tanks: many had been broken or crushed in antiquity. The tanks also contained traces of other pigments, such as yellow from antimonial lead and white. Chochlakies (Palaio Chorio). P. Triantaphyllidis (22nd EPCA) reports (AAA 39 [2006], 181) on surface remains at this hill site, located of Aionia (NW of Palaio Chorio). On the top of the hill were the remains of severely damaged walls, traces of dug features, level terraces and a few plainware sherds of the Hel and Rom periods. Reuse of the site, the fact that the buildings have only superficial foundations and the thinness of the anc. levels which were easily washed away in heavy rain, have combined to destroy most of the anc. remains. Mikro Damaki (Damakia). P. Triantaphyllidis (22nd EPCA) reports (AAA 39 [2006], 183-85) on evidence for a cemetery on this hill site SE of Megalo Chorio in the E of the island. An inscribed funerary stele of the LHel period reads: ...]HCEIC XPHCTH XAI[PE]. On the E side of the valley, close to the river, is a strong wall of polygonal masonry dating to the pre Rom period, with sherds (chiefly plainware) on the E slope. To the S, at the coastal site of Tsangaris, are ECh building remains (walls, cisterns, wells and remains of floors). The remains of a basilica also of the ECh period are known to the N, at Ag. Ioannis on the lower slopes of Mt Kephala, beneath the mod. church of Ag. Ioannis Pr?dromos and Ag. Eirene. Visible architectural members include a column, 2 marble column capitals of Corinthian type datable to the 5th and 6th Cts AD and 3 joining pieces of a marble inscription reading E A t which is now in the courtyard of the mod. church. S, on the summit of Mt Kephala, are FNeo sherds. Kavi. P. Triantaphyllidis (22th EPCA) reports (AAA 39 [2006], 185-86) on the discovery of an anc. quarry NE of Mt Kephala (close to the sites of Benetou and Prezibolia, where plainware sherds have been discovered). Upstanding, quarried masses of rock are visible, between which areas where blocks were quarried can be traced. There are 4 incised foot impressions which are life-sized (maximum /. 0.28m, d. 0.05-0.lm), one of which contains a dedicatory inscription recording the man's name A E A (w. 0.325m, h. of letters 0.05m). Tholoi. P. Triantaphyllidis (22nd EPCA) reports (AAA 39 [2006], 186-92) on investigation of a monumental, probably EByz, complex near the bay of Tholoi, ca. 2km SE of Megali Chorio. The structure is orthogonal, 25m 23m, oriented N-S, and has 7 ground-floor rooms or spaces with built vaults, entrances from the E and walls of isodomic rubble masonry. The walls, and parts of the stone paved or pebble floors, are coated with thick lime plaster. Terracotta pipes run down vertically inside the walls, probably as air channels, as well as in the ceiling, a clear feature of the domed ceiling construction. In the 3rd dome, an inscription was incised into the wall plaster, in 2 lines next to a Christogram within a circle, reading EA / IC NK. The building at present appears unique in the Aegean. The use of quarried stone and the absence of brick is a distinctive architectural trait, which classifies the building with the architectural styles of Syria and Asia Minor in LAntiquity. The tholoi were probably stores for grain or other foodstuffs. Indications that this was a 2 storey granary include the complete sealing of the interior with plaster, the air channels in the domed ceilings and dividing walls, and the fact that the floor is supported on columns (suspensurae). The form of the building - oriented N-S and</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 77 with small spaces of equal size laid out in line and protected on the E side by a stoa - indicates that it is to be associated with a horrea militaris. Use of the building in later phases is confirmed: some of the domed entrances on the S side were blocked and cuttings are preserved in the wall above them to support the joists for a wooden floor above. A. Giannikouri (Director, Archaeological Institute for Aegean Studies) reports a programme of study of human skeletal remains from the excavations of the 22nd EPCA, from the funerary monument on the Koundouri plot in the city of Rhodes, Myc graves at Charaki on Rhodes and Ar cemeteries on Kos. The project also includes examination of remains from cinerary urns and hydriae, ossuaries and bones from tombs on Rhodes and Nisyros. Kalymnos Ta Nea (19/03/09; 24/03/09) and To Vima (24/03/09) report the discovery by fishermen of a bronze statue, probably of the LHel period (end 2nd-Elst Ct BC) in the sea between the island of Nera and Kephala, Kos. Of this equestrian statue, the preserved part is a male torso wearing a short chiton with short sleeves, a corselet and chlamys, and with his right arm raised and the other across his body; a sword hangs from a shoulder strap, which is decorated with an engraved plaque bearing a depiction of an Archaising Nike. The statue was removed to the laboratory of the EMA for desalination and conservation. Kos Unification of the archaeological areas of the city of Kos. A. Giannikouri (Director, Archaeological Institute for Aegean Studies) reports. The earthquake of 1933, which levelled the greater part of the city of Kos, highlighted the necessity for an up-to-date city plan, in which, following the views of the archaeological service, building-free zones were formalized and characterized as archaeological parks, with the aim of promoting Kos as an archaeological city. The dialogue between the anc. and the mod. city began from that point. The large-scale excavations of the years 1928-1943 and then the work of the Ephoria of the Dodecanese have uncovered a large part of the the Hel-Rom city and its cemeteries. Work towards unification began in 2002 with the display of the archaeological site of the agora/harbour settlement at the beginning of an archaeological trail (Fig. 108). With funding from the EU 3rd Community Support Framework, the 2nd-3rd Ct AD Casa Romana, which covers an area of ca. 2,500 m2, was conserved and restored (Fig. 109). The archaeological trail incorporates the Rom odeion, which was restored under the Italian government and conserved and stabilized in the 1990s. Recent work includes the laying of a metal floor in the substructure, the organization of a photo graphic exhibition combined with audiovisual media concerning the history and operation of the odeion, and the conservation of the ECh house E of it. Kos. F. Sirano (SAIA) continued study of the House of the Rape of Europa, the House of the Silen and the Casa Romana. At the Asklepieion, preliminary observations were made on the paintings which decorated one of the vaults of the Great Bath on terrace III. The wall-painting of the House of the Rape of Europa can now be contextualized within the Decumanus quarter and, more generally, within the city and territory of Kos. The basic characteristics of the local Koan workshop can now be defined: typical and recurring motifs find precise parallels in the contem 108.

Kos: Casa Romana. porary workshops of Ephesus, Athens, Corinth and Thessaloniki, instead of the expected derivation from the repertoire used in the West and especially in Italy. Some connections and cross-fertil izations are obviously present, but they are very limited. We are now in a position to confirm the existence a workshop of pictores parietales perhaps including a pictor imaginarius. Topography of Kos. A. Giannikouri (Director, Archaeological Institute for Aegean Studies) reports on a collaborative programme with the Italian School (G. Rocco and M. Livadiotti, SAIA/Bari) to create an archaeological-topograph ical map using data from the excavations of the Italian Archaeological Mission, the 22nd EPCA and the 4th EBA. Continuous settlement from LNeo onwards is examined via a series of studies: on the successive settlement phases from the PH period, on the location of the boundaries of the polis of Kos Meropidas (10nd Ct BC until the synoikism of 366 BC) and on the Hel city and the settlement remains of the EChr period. The programme began with the study of the public buildings of the Hel city: systematic description and photography of architec tural members, generating information which is used for 3-D computer reconstruction of the monuments. Coinage of the Dodecanese. A. Giannikouri (Director, Archaeological Institute for Aegean Studies) reports the first result of this research programme of the Institute: a volume (in press) on the silver and bronze coinage of Kos (Fig. 110), and the coinage of foreign cities and kingdoms in circulation in the LCI and Hel city. This focuses on chronology (according to excavation data and hoards) in relation to the historical events of the period, as well as on the study of types, weight standards and fractions. Astypalaea Vathy. C. Doumas (ASA) reports (Ergon [2008], 119-23) on investigation of a hill which overlooks Vathy bay, in the part of Astypalaea. On the NE side of the hill, building remains may belong to an ECyc fortified settlement, dated by surface sherds, stone vessel fragments, rock engravings and a schematic marble figurine. In the Hel period, the hill surface was levelled, a large and strong TT-shaped retaining wall built and a tower built on the resulting terrace, like those generally found in the Aegean islands. Much of the architecture of the tower and neigh bouring remains was consumed in a lime kiln built here some decades ago, before the site was preserved. Tilos Publication: CM.

Giannikouri (Director, Archaeological Institute for Aegean Studies) reports on the creation of a database of the many thousands of (largely unpublished) stamped Rhodian amphorae, with associated typological study of the amphorae, and the assembly of a complete chronological chart of the eponymous archons. Petrographical and chemical analysis of the amphora fabric has begun in collaboration with NCSR Demokritos. Colour in antiquity. A. Giannikouri (Director, Archaeological Institute for Aegean Studies) reports on a research programme of the Institute concerning the use of colour in Rhodian art from the PH period to LAntiquity, conducted in collaboration with the Ormylia Art Diagnostic Centre. Samples analysed come from mortars, figurines, vases with applied colour (such as Hadra hydriae of Rhodian manufacture), altars, columns, sculpture etc. PH and Hel pigments have been analysed using non-destructive and micro-analytical techniques, such as photography under UV light. Corpus of Hel pottery from Rhodes. A.

The display includes one room devoted to the PH period, a 2nd on the cults, sanctuaries and settlements of historic times, and a 3rd on the LCI and Hel cemeteries of the city. In addition, the exhibition covers aspects of the mod. history and folklore of the island. 110.

A team of environmental specialists worked on flotation material, including charcoal, shells, foraminifera, seeds (grape, lentil and olive) and bone, as well as other fragments such as plaster. An unusual lead ring bezel recognized from building 5 may be a companion piece to the gold ring with hunt scene from the same area. Zakros. E. Platon (ASA/Athens) reports (Ergon [2008], 124 26) on a study season focused on pottery from excavations conducted by N. Platon in the M palace and town of Kato Zakros. Pottery from rooms 44 and 45 of the S workshop sector comprises coarse household ware, strengthening the interpreta tion of the assemblage as linked to the production and storage of foodstuffs and other goods. The relatively few examples of LMIB painted ware were accompanied by animal bones, including jawbones of ovicaprids and bovids. The pottery from areas 70 and 71 in the E wing comprises undecorated vessels for the storage of liquids. In the town, the pottery retained from building was studied. The discovery of part of a probable LMII Ephyrean goblet from the area immediately of the building shows that the area was reoccupied almost immediately following the destruction of the settlement and the palace at the end of LMIB, and that there were links with Knossos, from where table vessels of high quality were imported. Pottery from the upper terrace on the slope of Ag. Antonios included vessels for liquids, mostly handleless conical cups and kyathoi, many preserved more or less intact. This supports N. Platon's inter pretation that the artificial terraces constructed from large unworked stones were used as a kind of open-air sanctuary. Demos of Siteia Mochlos. J. Soles (ASCSA/ North Carolina) and C. Davaras (Athens) report on a further study season. Experimental pottery production continued with the M potter's wheel reconstructed in the artisans' quarter. Site conservation was completed for large parts of building C.7 and house C.3; the Prepalatial remains along the S fa?ade of C.7 were also consolidated and left exposed to view. Publication: J. Soles, Mochlos IIA: Period IV: the Mycenaean Settlement and Cemetery, the Sites (Philadelphia, INSTAP 2008). Papadiokambos. C. Sophianou (24 EPCA) reports on fieldwork at this M harbour town between the Mirabello and Siteia bays. The excavation and conservation of house A.l at the W end of the settlement was completed, and a ground-penetrating radar survey of the surrounding yard undertaken (Fig. 111). Ten rooms were uncovered on the ground floor (ca. 80-90% of the original plan): the undisturbed collapsed upper storey will allow for an unusually detailed understanding of the layout and contents of the upstairs rooms. House A.l has 2 architectural phases, the 2nd of which is LMIB, though probably not as late as the F LMIB phase identified at other sites in E Crete. The 1st phase of the house, dated to MMIIIB/LMIA, ended with the Theran eruption. In area B, trenches were opened in house B.l, 150m SE of area A. House B.l is a more impressive construction than house A.l, both in terms of its architecture and the finds, which include a copper ingot fragment and a pithos stamped 10 times with 2 different seals. All visible walls were mapped in areas B, C and D, which probably includes the centre and E end of the M town (Fig. 111). The town appears to cover 4-8ha. Geological studies were aimed at reconstructing the BA landscape and the geological and tectonic events that may have been factors in the destruction and preservation of the site. In area D, waves have exposed a thick layer of tephra from the BA Theran eruption, which covers M walls and pottery. The first stage of the pottery study of house A.l has been completed. Samples were collected from all ceramic and many stone objects (600 artefacts) and 100 samples chosen for the final organic residue study. More than 400 soil flotation samples have now been sorted and studied. House A.l produced an exceptional record for the preparation and consumption of shellfish and fish, while soil samples from the hearths and jars from houses A.l and B.l contain a rich collection of carbonized plant remains (olive, legumes, grape, fig and almond). Preliminary studies of the artefacts and ecofacts suggest that the inhabitants produced small amounts of olive oil and wine in the houses. Pseira. P.P. Betancourt (ASCSA/Temple) and C. Davaras (Athens) report on fieldwork focused on mapping the geology of Pseira and the quarries used by the Minoans. Three major quarry areas have been identified on the island, of which 2 were used to quarry metacarbonate, an altered limestone with a layered structure that breaks easily into slabs, and the 3rd produced hard and compact dark gray limestone. Other small areas where stones were removed from bedrock have also been identified. These materials were used differently in the architecture of the town. The metacarbonate was used primarily for floor slabs, thresholds and staircases, while the dark gray limestone was used for load-bearing walls. These 2 materials, plus mud-brick, formed the major components of the Pseiran houses, along with smaller amounts of other stones, including sandstone quarried from the coast near mod. Mochlos and a crystallized limestone from an unknown location. Demos of Leuke SE Crete, Archaeological Land Survey. S. Apostolakou (Director, 24th EPCA) and N. Schlager (Austrian Institute/ Vienna) report on the 2008 survey season, a continuation of a collaborative project begun in 1996 (see AR 43 [1996-1997], 117-18) and continued in 2000.</page><page sequence="80">80 TODD WHITELAW AND CATHERINE MORGAN 111. Papadiokambos: site map and plan of house A.l. At Aspro Nero (Paletsi) further Cyclopean walls were found abutting the bastion to the N. These are closely similar in construction technique and size of boulders to the walls of the large MM/LM settlement at Chametoulo (Aletourgio/Vrysi) 1.7km to the N. Aspro Nero may be interpreted as a fortified post controlling the low-lying valley leading from the coast up to Chametoulo. Most datable sherds in the area of these walls (and elsewhere on the site) are MM, with some LM and a few Byz or Emod. glazed sherds. At the S border of the site, S of the S bastion, a huge natural limestone outcrop resembles Horns of Consecration with their long axis oriented N-S. Some distance below to the E lies a small artificial platform. In an outcrop on its E side, deep, narrow crevices contained numerous MM sherds, mainly cooking pots, bowls and cups, deposited deliberately. This assemblage appears to be the debris from outdoor feasting in association with the outcrop. At Ag. Irini it is evident that the 2 sites previously identified (20 and 21) form part of one large FNeo-EMII settlement extending from the top of Kastri down its S and E slopes. There are no substantial differences in the materials and building techniques of the much eroded, flimsy walls just below the top of the hill compared to those further downslope. The earlier assumption of a later MM date for the terrace buildings must be abandoned, although MM pottery is conspicuous on terrace III. Considering the vast amount of FNeo-EMII material across the site, the MM sherds imply a partial, perhaps temporary, reoc cupation of this specific area in the MBA, though no MM archi tectural remains have been recognized. The top of the hill is devoid of architectural features. Numerous fragments of Melian obsidian blades and cores, and local flints, concentrated on terraces I and II, imply knapping and working areas used by specialized craftsmen, who acquired or imported foreign raw materials and probably produced tools on the spot. Documentation of all visible remains indicates that this is one of the largest FNeo-EMII settlements in the area between Zakros, Xerokampos and Goudouras. Prior to 2008, the coastal strip and plateau of Livari had not been surveyed in its entirety (Fig. 112). Parts of it were documented in 2000: an ?EM/MM settlement at Cheromylia (site 36), an EM-MMI cemetery and tholos tomb at Skiadi (site 37: see Goudouras below) and a FNeo settlement at Katharades (sites 34 and 35) on high ground above the coast. In 2008, the area was completely mapped, including all anc. and mod. structures, not all of which were previously known: site 38 denotes those structures W of the gorge of Ankastara (N of sites 36 and 37) and site 39 those to the E. Confirmed anc. sites are as follows.</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 81 Site 38A (Fig. 113): FNeo-EMII settlement with a minimum N-S extension of 75m along the E slope of the small coastal range of Kastrokephalaki. Site 38B: quadrangular rock cut feature at the peak of Kastrokephalaki with small cleft in the rock. Site 38C: walled-off and partly robbed cave on the W slope of the same range with many EMI/EMII sherds, including one fragment of fine Vasiliki ware of EMIIB. Since no bones were detected, the function of the cave as a burial place remains doubtful. Site 36: the site plan was supplemented with the addition of walls and buildings not previously recognized. Pottery and portable finds confirm a date no earlier than MM; the presence of LM pottery indicates continuing activity into the LBA. Site 37: more EM and later pottery was identified and recorded in and around tholos tomb I within the necropolis of site 37 (Skiadi). Because of its proximity to 38A, it must be seen now as the contemporary cemetery of that settlement. In addition, site 39A is a 19th Ct AD walled look-out post (vigla) on top of the steep cliff at the E limits of Livari. This season's work allows a summary of the local development of settlement in the area: (1) FNeo settlement: Katharades acropolis (site 35) and Katharades bastion (site 34); (2) FNeo-EMII settlement: Kastrokephalaki (38A) with cult place (38B) and cave (burial?) deposit (38C); the necropolis at Skiadi (37) probably built and in use contemporaneously; (3) MM/LM settlement at Cheromylia (36); part of cemetery at Skiadi probably still in use; (4) LBA: end of continuous settlement at Livari. The hypothesis that Cl-Hel Stalai should be located at Livari could not be confirmed archaeologically. Goudouras (Livari-Skiadi). C. Sophianou (24th EPCA) reports on the excavation of a Prepalatial cemetery, at the site of Livari-Skiadi, 5km E of Goudouras on a small promontory at the edge of a coastal plain. A circular tholos tomb and a rock-shelter were noted: fragmentary walls suggest the existence of additional burial buildings in the area. In 2008, excavation was limited to the interior of the tholos (interior di. 4m), the entrance to which is to the SE. The burial stratum was unlooted but mixed due to the continuous use of the tomb. It contained large quantities of very fragmented, burnt human bone from secondary burials. Other finds include clay vases, animal bones, sea shells, chipped obsidian and chert tools, a copper dagger and several items of gold, silver and stone jewellery. Preliminary study of the pottery indicates that the tomb was built in EMIB and continued in use though E A and EMIIB, and probably EMIII/MMIA. 112.

The EMI site, which consists of a small 2-room building and courtyard surrounded by a fortification wall, is situated on a hilltop W of the village of Episkopi, overlooking the mod. road across the Isthmus of Ierapetra.

Nine or more large pithoi were preserved (among the earliest known in Crete) (Fig. 114), in addition to smaller clay vessels. Immediately of the building was a large area where fires had burned the soil red. It is suggested that this was the location of a signal fire, with the fortified enclosure serving as a refuge for the local population. The wall also enclosed the entrance to a small cave which could have provided water and additional space for storage. The site provides new evidence for the unsettled conditions in E Crete at the beginning of the BA. Azoria. D. Haggis (ASCSA/North Carolina) and M. Mook (ASCSA/Iowa State) report on the 2nd season of study and conservation following the 2002-2006 excavations. Study of iron artefacts and slag allowed the identification of a number of smithing hearth bottoms from EIA and Ar fill levels. Seventeen inscribed sherds (6th-5th Ct BC) were studied for publication. Animal bone identifications were completed, and querns were sampled for residue analysis. Study of the human remains from the small tholos tomb in trench 3700 indicates a minimum of 7 individuals (5 adults, 2-3 children). All structures on the SW slope of the S acropolis were conserved. Gournia Survey. L.V. Watrous (Buffalo/ASCSA) reports on continued study of material from the 1992-1994 survey. Work was begun in the area of Sphoungaras, identifying and mapping the walls excavated by Harriet Boyd in 1901-1904: some are identified as fortification walls (with towers), others were Prepalatial house walls, while yet others served agricul tural purposes.

Apostolakou (Director, 24th EPCA) reports (Kentro 11 [2008], 1-2) on the rescue excavation of a rock-shelter exposed during construction work for the cemetery of Pacheia Ammos. In addition to a M pithos burial, an assemblage of Prepalatial pottery was discovered in one of a series of trenches opened along the length of the site, along with stone tools and an almost square pit dug into the soft rock. The latter was probably part of a rock-shelter destroyed by the mechanical digger, leaving its contents undisturbed. A - shaped wall closed the opening of the shelter. Inside, a layer ca. 0.4m d. contained a large quantity of vases, almost 100 stone tools, 8 loomweights, a few obsidian flakes and 2 or 3 fragments of potters' turntables. The pottery is entirely handmade in local clay. While many vessels, including wide mouthed prochoes, pithoi, amphorae and tripod cooking pots, are made from a red, coarse-looking clay, a greater number in a wide variety of shapes are made from a yellow-ochre coloured clay and in some cases are decorated with dark coloured bands or drips. A smaller number belong to the Light on Dark style, with the linear decoration characteristic of the end of the Prepalatial period in E Crete. The function of the rock-shelter remains unknown, although the complete absence of bones precludes the usual use as a tomb. An explanation in terms of storage of materials also has weaknesses, because the quantity of vessels exceeds that of usual household storage. An answer may be provided by chemical residue analysis of the 500 samples which have been taken from the pottery assemblage. Pacheia Ammos, Pefka. S. Apostolakou (Director, 24th EPCA) reports (Kentro 11 [2008], 1-2) on an exploratory excavation conducted just SE of the rescue excavation at Alatsomouri. Upon removal of the topsoil, 7 rectangular cuttings in the soft limestone were revealed, evenly spaced ca. 2m apart. These are described by the excavator as vats or basins (Fig. 115). To the of this row, 2 larger rock-cut depressions were found: the 1st is round (2m di), while the 2nd, a small distance to the E, measures ca. 4m 2.5m and is 0.5m d. (within it a well had been excavated to a d. of 8.5m). 115. Pacheia Ammos, Pefka: plan of rock-cuttings. The only preserved remains of walls lie between basins 4 and 5: these form a shape, with 1 row of small stones preserved. Between these walls were found fragments of murex shell. Due to the shallowness of the fill, excavation across the entire area yielded only a small amount of pottery and very few stone tools from most of the basins, plus a small quantity of murex shell. However, investigation of basin 2, and in particular the deep well, produced more than 50 crates of pottery, apparently all of the MMIIB period, together with a large number of stone tools, a few clay loomweights, shells, animal bones and a few bones of an adult male human. Flotation of the soil provided palaeobotanical evidence as well as carbon. More than 100 vessels have so far been restored, including tripod cooking pots, prochoes, a bottomless tripod vessel, pithoi and amphorae with characteristic MMIIB decoration, carinated cups, conical cups, basins and a few examples of Kamares Ware. From the well also comes a 3-sided steatite seal which appears to be a product of the Malia workshop. The number and position of the vats or basins, the deep well and the channel which connects it with one of the rectangular basins, the troughs dug in the ground, the murex shells between the basins, a pithos base found full of shattered murex shells, the type of stone tools and the large quantity of utilitarian coarse pottery (cooking pots, amphorae, basins, pithoi and spouted cups), often with unusually thick walls, suggest that this is an industrial area for the working of murex and the dyeing of wool purple (and perhaps with other plant and mineral colours as well). It has been argued that the production of purple dye began on Crete during the MM period, due to the discovery of murex shells with pottery of this period at sites such as Kouphonisi, Palaikastro, Kommos and now Pacheia Ammos and Chrysi in E Crete. Yet very few sites have been identified as installations for the production of purple dye and/or dyeing works, and these are mostly outside Greece and of more recent periods. It is hoped that organic residue analysis from samples taken from more than 600 sherds will provide further evidence of the activities undertaken at this site.</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 83 Vasiliki. Publication: A. Zois, a e a e a : e a : a a a (Athens, Apodexis 2007). Demos of Agios Nikolaos Mirabello. A. Farnoux (EfA/Paris), H. Wurmser (EfA), S. Apostolakou (Director, 24th EPCA) and V. Zographaki (24th EPCA) report on continuing research on the Lato region. At Lato, a series of cores were taken in the dolines previously located, in furtherance of the hydro-morphological study of the W limits of the territory of Lato. At Dreros, a preparatory campaign was undertaken to produce topographic maps and plans, and re-examine previously excavated monuments (the temple, the agora and the so-called Andreion'). At the EIA site of Anavlochos (between Malia and Dreros), a study season was conducted with the aim of publishing the material excavated by P. Demargne. While the majority of the material dates from LGeo and the beginning of the Or period, occupation continued in the Ar period, perhaps until the beginning of the 5th Ct BC. Priniatikos Pyrgos. B. Molloy (IIHSA/Dublin) and B. Hayden (ASCSA/Pennsylvania Museum) directed excavations at the FNeo-Ot site, continuing work in 2 trenches opened in previous seasons and opening 2 new trenches (Fig. 116). In area H, the main objective was to clarify the nature of the deposits filling the clefts in the bedrock in the area behind the small kiln previously excavated. While some of the earlier deposits could have been washed into these gaps, most material was deliberately introduced as a levelling deposit. The material is primarily EM with some FNeo, but the rarer MM sherds give a likely date for this activity. It is probable that the kiln was in use in MMIB. One wall appears to be MM in date, with possible reuse in the Hel period. A pebble layer directly E had small worn sherds of consistent EM date, probably brought from nearby to create a level terrace. This area has suffered much from both marine and aeolian erosion, making it difficult to ascertain its original nature and use. The ceramic sequence preserves phases from FNeo through to the MMIB, with some LM and Cl/Hel sherds in the uppermost levels. In trench II, walls and other features (particularly an ossuary) were encountered directly beneath the surface during the 2007 campaign (Fig. 117). These features were exposed further. The associated pottery is predominantly LByz, and includes examples of very high quality (for example, imported sgraffito and trail-slip wares), indicating activity of significant status, and perhaps a monastic settlement. Local tradition reports churches on Priniatikos Pyrgos, and the mortar used in one apsidal wall suggests an EByz date for the revealed structure. Since the 'apse' would be located on the N, rather than the E, side of the building, this may be part of a triconch church with , E and W apses. Excavation within the room to the revealed no trace of a floor, but 3 probable MM-LM walls were exposed at deeper levels. The alignment of one suggests a Hel date, but the pottery in the fill around it was predominantly LMIA. 116. Priniatikos Pyrgos: site map with trenches.</page><page sequence="84">84 TODD WHITELAW AND CATHERINE MORGAN 117. Priniatikos Pyrgos: trench II. A major feature in trench II is an MByz or LByz ossuary. Excavation of ca. 35% of the structure has produced remains of at least 20 individuals deposited in a single event. These may originally have come from a cemetery associated with an EByz or MByz church, being reinterred when a later church was built. Since some of the pottery is EByz, it is clear that some of the original graves date to this period. Two exploratory soundings revealed several phases of metalled surfaces, incorporating different size beach pebbles in different phases. While much of the pottery in the fill above was Rom, the surfaces appear to be of MM date. They represent a large outdoor area near the summit of the headland, possibly associated with a building underlying the Byz structures. Trench III was opened on the W of the promontory, between kilns 1 and 2, to investigate activities in this area and determine the nature and extent of tidal erosion of deposits on this slope. A cobbled surface in the S of the trench appears to be part of a Hel or Cl road. Deeper, a series of clayey laminations were apparently washed into the area. It is suggested that these incorporate debris from pottery production, as the spot lies between two PH kilns, though the deposit appears to be LMIA at the earliest. This fits the suggested industrial function of this area throughout PH and historic times. Further N, a cement lined reservoir may be Ot in date, reusing part of a MM wall. Beneath it in the centre of the trench, paving slabs of limestone, schist and conglomerate extend over an area larger than any domestic paved surfaces at nearby LM Gournia (Fig. 118). of the paving, an artificial terrace was built at or just above the level of outcropping bedrock. The fill contained a large quantity of EM pottery, but the less numerous MBA sherds indicate that it was probably constructed in MMI-II. A sounding to the W revealed small patches of surfaces and a pottery sequence probably spanning MMI-II to LMIA. Trench IV was opened to the E to determine whether substantial depths of PH deposit exist on this side of the promontory. All of the walls encountered appear to date to the 19th Ct, though no associated floor level was discovered. An earlier, EM or MM, metalled surface lay just beneath the walls, though this was discontinuous throughout the trench. Erosion had stripped away later soil horizons (consistent with the damaged condition of the surface) and this surface was exposed in parts, possibly in the 5th Ct BC and certainly in E historic times. A large deep pit, possibly a well (excavation stopped at -1.6m), was located in the SE corner of the trench. The chronological span of occupation underlines the site's importance. PH, Cl and LByz materials in particular reflect the high status of the settlement at least in these periods. The secure deposits of various dates will be used to refine the local chronology developed for the Vrokastro Survey Project, allowing a more detailed understanding of this centre within its regional context. The diachronic research strategy will further illuminate the role of this community in the environmentally and culturally dynamic land and sea-scape setting investigated by the Istron Geoarchaeological Project. Demos of Malia Malia, Quartier Delta. M. Pomad?re (EfA) reports on a 3rd campaign of excavation in building TT. The principal objectives were to define the limit of the main building in the Neopalatial period; to complete the excavation of the levels of this phase in the W sector (zones 4 and 5); and to make soundings to reconstruct the complete occupation sequence of the building. As presently understood, building TT (Neopalatial phase I) is bounded to the E by a lane (Fig. 119). To the NE, wall 109 formed the fa?ade separating the building from areas to the which seem to have been largely abandoned after MMII (areas 17-18 and perhaps 21). In the NW, where an exterior wall had been expected, it appears that area 8 was bounded to the only by light structures, with a passage to the NW. Immediately to the is a court of beaten earth (25), which seems to have been used in the Protopalatial period, and which produced 2 sherds inscribed with hieroglyphic signs (a potter's mark and an inscription formed of 3 signs).

Lastly, a small sounding was opened W of the W fa?ade of building TT, in order to determine whether a street passed here. The structures partially revealed (flagstones and a sandstone 'gourna') rather seem to be part of a Neopalatial building between a and . Excavation of the palatial levels of building TT related to the corridor IB, semi-basements 10 and 11, and areas 14 and 16. The domestic, residential and relatively modest nature of the Neopalatial building is confirmed particularly by the pottery, notably storage vessels, ceramics related to food production and weights. In particular, the SW angle of area 16 was occupied by 2 lines of large jars or pithoi, forming a niche in which were found many complete conical cups, several cups and animal bones. A complete tripod pot also comes from this deposit, intended for food production. Many difficulties remain in reconstructing the organization of the sector and the circulation patterns both within the building and in the neighbourhood. Several soundings illuminated the sequence of occupation in the sector. There is a distinction between the N, which was abandoned after the Protopalatial period, and the S, where the Neopalatial levels seem to rest directly on EM deposits. It is possible that traces of Protopalatial occupation were completely removed during the construction of the Neopalatial building, in the limited area explored by soundings. Demos of Neapolis Sissi. J. Driessen (Belgian School/UC Louvain) and I. Schoep (Belgian School/KU Leuven) report on a 2nd season of excavation at the M settlement and cemetery on the Buffo (Kefali tou Ag. Antoniou), working in 6 zones across the site (Fig. 120). Additional information and images are provided on the project website: http://sites.uclouvain.be/sarpedon. In zone 1 (Fig. 121), the burial area occupies several natural terraces on the NE slope. To the W, a rock-shelter produced a dense fill of MM, LMI and LMIII sherds, associated with animal bones, charcoal fragments and a human leg bone. Burial building 1.9-10 contained 2 chambers, the 1st of which held the skulls of 9 adults, a child and a newborn, as well as long bones, all probably cleared from other burial buildings.</page><page sequence="86">86 TODD WHITELAW AND CATHERINE MORGAN 120. Sissi: site map with trenches.</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 87 The 2n , not yet fully excavated, yielded 3 skulls and other bones. No objects accompanied the depositions in either room. E of the building are traces of sandstone quarrying. Upslope are burial buildings made of small fieldstones; the entrances may have been through the eroded walls. Dense deposits of pottery and bones between the rear wall of each building and the rising bedrock may represent tomb clearance. In burial building 1.1-2-3, space 1.2 preserved 2 articulated skeletons deposited in EMIII/MMI. An MMII pithos burial contained the trussed skeleton of a woman aged around 40. Space 1.3 contained EMIII-MMIA cups placed upside down, with a bronze pin and a single bone. Excavation of burial building 1.6-7-8 continued from 2007. Room 1.8 held 3 adults and 2 children, and room 1.7 an adult and a child. One of the adults in 1.8 was in an articulated position, 1 of the children was associated with a shell; a quartz bead and 2 MMIB-MMII cups were also recovered. In burial building 1.11-12,1.11 contained 4 primary burials, at least 3 vases, the remains of a larnax and a fragment of stone vase. In 1.12, at least one burial was found in the N, while to the S, 2 jars, 2 spouted jars and an EMIIA tumbler were found; at least 2 of the jars held the remains of foetuses or newborn infants. In zone 2, further exploration of the megalithic building revealed a mature LMI destruction deposit in room 2.1. The main structure is a large room, ca. 10.3m 8.86m, with a few thin partitions. A platform was constructed against the E wall, with a possible column base in front of it. Finds include bronze needles and fragments of other bronze tools, a steatite button, a schist disc, loomweights and stone tools. Four small rooms added at the SE contained pottery, stone tools and loomweights. Since neither the layout nor the contents of the building appear domestic, it is interpreted as an industrial complex. Two structures to the NE of similar construction and plan may also be industrial facilities. In zones 3 and 4 on the summit of the hill, excavation in 2007 revealed a large building probably constructed in EM 11 I/MM IA and reused in LMI and LMIIIA-B (Fig. 122). The terrace walls defining the W and edges of the summit largely mask the exterior walls of this building, but where visible, they are built with large, sometimes dressed blocks of limestone or conglom erate, presenting imposing fa?ades. During LMI and LMIIIB the building was ca. 40m 25m, and of irregular shape, constrained by the shape of the hilltop and a road on the SE. The SW fa?ade of the building may have been reached, though it is possible that there is a court located further S. It is likely that this was the main structure on the site during these phases. Many rooms have been traced but not yet fully excavated. In 2007, a LMIIIB destruction level with pithoi and kraters was found in rooms 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, and in 2008 this was confirmed in room 3.4. Pithoi were recovered in rooms 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5, there was a probable hearth in 3.4 and a small staircase may lie between 3.3 and 3.6. Room 3.1 was probably the main room of the complex. In addition to a range of vessels, more than 80kg of pumice may have fulfilled some workshop function, since obsidian blades, steatite cores, a circular stone with a central depression, stone vase fragments and other stone debris were also recovered. A large clay tube with 3 attached horns of consecration raises the possibility that there was a shrine in room 3.8. Outside the entrance to room 3.3, a niche containing 4 identical juglets may be some kind of ritual deposit. In zone 4, room 4.4 (E of the monumental threshold revealed in 2007) may have been an open court. Where the S wall of room 4.5 abuts the W wall of room 4.4, a foundation deposit was discovered. This consisted of a large open vessel closed with a sherd (with a handle), an inverted (Neopalatial) conical cup contained within this vessel and, above, fragments of a triton shell. In the middle of room 4.6, a slab probably 121. Sissi: plan of zone 1 burial buildings. supported a column. The ceramic material may suggest an earlier destruction (LMIIIA) than in zone 3. In the NW corner of the complex, some destruction was caused by a probable World War II gun emplacement; other possible such emplace ments extend downslope to the NW. Exploration of zone 5 revealed rooms belonging to one or more buildings. Rooms 5.6, 5.8 and 5.12 preserve burnt debris and pottery including fine decorated LMIIIA1 drinking vessels. In the SW corner of room 5.8, hidden beneath the floor, a large (d. 0.46m) handleless lead vase was recovered. In zone 6, tests made in a large structure revealed the E fa?ade and at least 3 rooms. From the destruction layer outside the building came tiny fragments of coloured wall-plaster, a fragment of a stone vase and an ogival cup. Excavation of the interior is unfinished; a fragmentary potter's wheel, a lead weight and an LMIIIA2 amphora have been recovered. A massive cyclopean wall (Fig. 123) forms a corner at the SW foot of the hill. One segment is about 2m h. and is preserved for almost 10m. A Neopalatial deposit was stratified against this wall, although a fragment of a Rom amphora was also recovered. Since this is the easiest access to the hill, the walls may have been intended to serve as a defensive bastion. Excavations in 2008 confirmed the chronological span and historical interest of the site. Some FNeo/EMI sherds suggest that the hill was at least visited at this time. The cemetery was in use from EMIIA onwards, and the settlement from at least EMIII: both continued to be used in MMII, although perhaps on a more limited scale. During LMI, the EMIII/MMI building on top of the hill was reused, and industrial buildings may have occupied the middle terrace. There is evidence for fire destruction in mature LMI on the summit and middle terrace. From at least LMIIIA1 onwards, only the summit was densely occupied. The final destruction, by fire and perhaps also earthquake, occurred in the mature LMIIIB period.</page><page sequence="88">88 TODD WHITELAW AND CATHERINE MORGAN 122.

Davaras (Athens) report on continuing study of material excavated from the cave of Ag. Charalambos. Over 10,000 human bones have been catalogued. While the total number of individuals is still uncertain because the bones were disarticulated and sorted by the Minoans before being placed in the cave, at least 400 individuals of all ages and both sexes are represented, and the actual number may be twice this figure or more. There are several examples of trepanation. Among several thousand animal bones, sheep or goat, cattle, pig, bird, hare, dog, cat, badger and other species are represented, with sheep/goat forming the largest group. Some animal bones have cut marks indicating butchery, and it is assumed that many of the bones represent food buried with the deceased. Karfi. S. Wallace (BSA/Reading) directed excavations at the mountaintop settlement (ca. 1200-1000 BC) and MM peak sanctuary of Karfi first excavated by J. Pendlebury in 1937 1939. The aim was to investigate the distribution of the settlement over the 3 peaks of Karfi, Mikri Koprana and Megali Koprana, clarify the chronology of this occupation, identify and charac terize earlier phases of site use and explore the potential for further research. Four trenches were opened in different areas of the site (Fig. 124), together covering ca. 124m2 and each investigating specific questions.</page><page sequence="89">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 124. Karfi: site map with trenches, plan of trenches Al and Cl.</page><page sequence="90">90 TODD WHITELAW AND CATHERINE MORGAN In area A, E of the ridge linking the settlement zone excavated in the 1930s with the large unexcavated area on Megali Koprana 300m to its S, a massively-constructed, large and isolated, surface-visible building with a 'Mycenaeanizing' plan (Al) suggested a temple or other public building of LMIIIC date. This supposition was supported by some details of construction and the artefact record recovered: the latter includes a surface figurine, fragments of clay stands, large quantities of finewares and at least one giant pithos. Since the previously excavated sector of Karfi had its own public temple, building Al (if a temple) might represent an institution founded by a community sub-sector with a distinct, separate identity, located in area MG, or a sanctuary serving several sub communities within the town. Evidence for such a level of political and social complexity is lacking in any of the (mostly smaller) 12th Ct settlements systematically investigated in Crete. On the summit of Megali Koprana (area MG) a very dense and extensive area of LMIIIC architecture forms a separate well-defined sector of probably ca. lha within the town. It was investigated through the excavation in its part of a LMIIIC building complex of at least 3 rooms (2 very sizeable and one with a central hearth) which had been destroyed by fire. This ensured excellent preservation of artefacts and organic remains including large burnt beams lying at floor level. The trench also produced the only exterior deposit so far recorded on the site, immediately to the E of MG1. This seems to comprise refuse layers, characterized by a high density and variety of animal bone, and will be extremely useful in characterizing subsistence at this upland site. In area B, a house of LMIIIC date (Bl) was investigated immediately adjacent to Pendlebury's excavation, in order to document a representative stratigraphy for the previously excavated zone. Two N-S orientated rooms of a structure including at least 3 rooms were half-sectioned, allowing significant enhancement of understanding of the site through the first proper recording of a hearth and a corner work platform/stand in the E room and of a very wide range of LMIIIC vessel types preserved as complete or almost-complete vessels. These seem to have been smashed in the burnt destruction of the building. Extensive soil sampling, systematic sampling for organic residue extraction from the full range of ceramic wares and soil micromorphology studies on and around features within the room will greatly increase our understanding of how these spaces were used. An extensive deposit of MMII date was found under the LMIIIC house. This is highly significant in relation to the MM use of the Karfi peak, located ca. 150m to the W, as a peak sanctuary . The deposit as currently exposed is not definitely of ritual character (though one miniature vessel was found) and may represent ancillary activity of a kind not previously documented at any peak sanctuary. In area C, a large 2-room building of massive construction was visible on the surface at the site's extreme E edge and close to a probable LMIIIC fortification wall. The structure was investigated to establish the date of its construction and the date of the maximal spread of the LMIIIC settlement, and to help assess the date and use of the wall. Excavation of the S room suggested the complex to be of LMIIIC date, and showed it to preserve a large number of complete ceramic vessels and 2 hearths (one roughly central, the other against the S wall). Since there was apparently no communication with the room, the investigation may be able to elucidate the phenomenon of the one-room household in LMIIIC Crete, though interestingly the room excavated is much larger than typical one-room houses of the period, including those in the old Karfi excavated zone. The 4 building complexes seem to have somewhat different dates within the period defined by LMIIIC ceramics, and study of their artefact record will throw considerable light on the development of the town over time. Each building allows specific new interpretations to be made about the site, both in terms of its internal spatial, social and economic organization, and its wider historical context. One of the most interesting findings is that at least some parts of the site (Bl, MG1) were violently destroyed by fire: most LMIIIC settlements were hitherto thought to be peacefully abandoned at the beginning of the polis-state emergence process in Crete, ca. 1000 BC. This not only makes for outstanding preservation of the archaeolog ical remains, but potentially changes the historical under standing of the period. The project also includes a number of scientific studies designed to extract the maximum information from this site, and pursue research questions centred on economic adaptations in a period of major upheaval in Cretan history, here involving movement of a sizeable population to an upland environment. These include systematic sampling for wet sieving, soil micro morphology, organic residue analysis, C14 dating and charcoal identification. CENTRAL CRETE (Nomos of Herakleion) (23rd EPCA; 13th EBA) Demos of Arkalochori Ini. Ethnos (17/05/08) reports an account of excavations by A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) which brought to light inscriptions referring to the 2nd site of anc. Arkadia. Ten inscriptions were preserved, plus several buildings, including a bath, an aqueduct and an Episcopal basilica similar to that at Gortyn (Fig. 125). Demos of Gazi Agios Nikolaos, Gazi. / Tolmi (25/01/09) reports an account by A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) of excavations in 2006 and 2008 of a Neo and EPrepalatial settlement on a plot belonging to the cemetery of Ag. Nikolaos. The site was discovered during the opening of a new road between Gazi and Ammoudara, and is located on the W slope of a hill overlooking the river valley. The central settlement probably lay to the SW on the height of Papoura (or Baira); it is likely that a major BA settlement is located there. 125. Ini: basilica.</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 91 In 2006, research focused on round cuttings in the rock exposed by the road construction, which were initially thought to be LMIII graves on account of the pottery collected. Six round, well-like cuttings were found, which were entered from above; they had been completely looted in antiquity, so while they contained sherds of all periods, animal bones and many stones, their function could not be ascertained from their contents. Investigation then moved to the surface of the plot, where the topsoil was removed over a 25m 5m strip. A large quantity of fine-quality pottery was collected from disturbed surface levels, indicating continuous use of the site from M to Rom times. One small cutting located close to the others was excavated, noting another 3 larger ones further S which were evenly spaced in a row. Two of these large cuttings were excavated, but yielded little information with which to charac terize them, as they had been robbed in antiquity, just as their smaller counterparts had been. The interpretation of these features thus remains open. They contained stones, many unusable or broken stone tools, many animal bones and much coarse and cooking ware which is mainly Rom and EByz in date. The most likely interpreta tion of these features is as stores for grain or agricultural products. In the middle cutting was found an unusual tool of grey-black flint, which is reported as appearing somewhat older than Neo. Undisturbed FNeo (4300-3000 BC) and EPrepalatial (EMI and EMIIA, 3000-2600 BC) layers were the major discovery. A deposit of pottery and stone tools is probably associated with a small house excavated immediately to the S, though there were no architectural remains in the EM level. This level covers an area 1.35m 0.7m and is 0.15m d. The pottery divides into 2 principal categories: scored or wiped ware, made in brown clay which varies from light to dark and black, and which shows many varieties of decoration (from light and fine to deep and wide impressions), and burnished ware with simple or pattern burnish and an ash grey or black surface colour. This dates to the LNeo period, although some sherds with pattern burnish could be EMI Pyrgos Ware. Many of the sherds collected come from large vessels. Demos of Gortyn Gortyn Profitis Ilias settlement. N. Allegra (SAIA/Palermo) reports on the 2008 season of excavation in the area of building I, and in buildings II-V. Extension of the excavation of building I, between the alley Bll and the site fence, has identified the limit of court B12 as a terrace wall of sandstone blocks, partially collapsed into 12, which supported a fill (perhaps an open and paved space). The fill was defined on the E by space B23. In building III, excavation was limited to removal of the alluvial soil in the NW quadrant of the large courtyard B6. The limit of this court has yet to be defined, nor is its function clear, although it may lead from a porch to the S (space B5), inside which was a circular structure. In building IV, extension of the excavation has allowed the identification of 3 new spaces (B20-22), probably all belonging to building IV, with which they share E and W perimeter walls, though as yet no doorways have been found between these spaces and those to the S (B16-17). The limit of the new spaces has not been reached. In B20, a layer of stone chips covered the remains of structures that delimited a fill of small stones and earth extending over an abandonment layer of the 7th Ct AD. In B21 and B22, the abandonment layer has been reached but not investigated. In the centre of 17 lay a circular structure made from stones set on edge, above which was a cup and other sherds: this was probably a form of eschara. Excavation was resumed in building V, W of the N-S alley 18, and has better defined the character of this sector, which was inhabited in the 7th Ct AD. There is a recurrent pattern of wide courtyards (B12, B6, 19) fronting on the E-W street axis. It is not yet clear if the open spaces relate to individual inhabited units, as seems to be the case for 12 and 18, or if one court may be common to 2 units, as perhaps for B6. An important discovery in space B20 is the first reported structures of a Hel complex buried by abandonment layers from the 7th Ct AD. Building S in the Byz quarter. G.M. Fabrini (SAIA/ Macerata) reports on a 2nd season of excavation in the quarter of the Byz houses, in an area occupied by the large S building which faces the W street, and which by virtue of its distinctive plan, structural characteristics and location, should be charac terized as a public building . Completion of the sondage in the central area (area 53) allows the precise definition of the various chronological phases of the monument in this part of the city. In the large central hall, excavation was conducted down to virgin soil, into which were cut the foundations of the perimeter walls. Onto virgin soil was set the foundation for a fine pavement made of slabs of calcarenite: dating of the finds indicates a tpq for the construction of the S building in the last decades of the 4th Ct AD. Excavation revealed a later alteration of the wall to create a doorway linking with the adjoining area (area 50). At an undefined date, there is evidence of the partial ruin of the pavement onto which was set, into the W wall, a small rectangular basin of grey Gortynian marble, in fragile condition. The stratigraphy and preliminary study of the finds combine to suggest that the destruction of area 53 and perhaps of the S building are linked to the earthquake of 670, since there are considerable traces of fire. Quantitative and typological analyses of the mostly well preserved tiles found in the destruction layer confirm their comparability with those used to roof the area. The homogeneous group consists of cover tiles of types known from Gortyn in the LRom and Byz periods. Among the ceramics discovered are Byz overpainted glazed wares, Byz lamps and late types of African, eastern and local amphorae. In addition, the surface levels were investigated in areas 59 and 52b. In the latter area, excavation of a mod. ditch revealed part of a pavement, corresponding in elevation to that of the paved level of area 53. The discovery in the fill of this ditch of several sherds of 13th Ct sgraffito ware attests to use of the area during the Ven period. The Hellenistic temple. E. Lippolis (SAIA/Rome) reports on the completion of the excavation of the Hellenistic temple in the insula of the gymnasium of the praetorium. The building forms part of a monumental display founded both outside and in the SE angle of an insula which was developed to the of the praetorium complex, in a quarter with a high density of public buildings. The monumental nymphaeum near the temple was studied, and a new reconstruction proposed. Excavation conducted beside the E anta gave important information about an older building of smaller proportion, perhaps a first nymphaeum, to which a side fountain was added between the 2nd half of the 2nd and the 3rd Ct AD. The temple was shown to have 2 symmetrical pilasters which articulate the internal space of the pronaos, engaged with the side walls. Excavation in the</page><page sequence="92">92 TODD WHITELAW AND CATHERINE MORGAN original emplecton produced pottery of the final quarter of the 2nd and the first half of the 1st Ct BC. In the area between the nymphaeum and the temple, a monumental hall was built perhaps at the end of the 1st Ct AD: the robbing trench of the front wall and at least half of a large threshold block of white limestone, resting against the E wall of the sacred building, have been identified. This new building forms a continuum with the S fa?ade of the insula, but is only partially preserved. For the LImperial occupation phases, research concentrated on the final phase in the area NE of the public building constructed on top of the temple during the 2nd half of the 4th Ct AD. The levels immediately predating the final abandonment were excavated. Under a partial collapse of the upper part of the walling emerged a hearth constructed on a simple clay base with a cooking pot with a lid close by. This was complete but fragmentary, having been suddenly crushed by falling blocks between the 7th and the 8th Ct AD. Theatre of the Pythion. F. Ghedini and J. Bonetto (SAIA/Padua) led a team from the University of Padua in stablizing and consolidating some of the walling of the theatre of the Pythion. Work focused on the lower annular passage where the vaults, which are not completely preserved, were reinforced with wooden props to prevent any possibility of collapse. In the area of the scene building, consolidation was undertaken on the E part of the enclosing wall which was leaning markedly. Surface clearing was undertaken inside and outside the building, and tree and plant growth, which interfered with the visibility of the building and threatened the structure itself, was removed. The Byzantine quarter of the Pythion. E. Zanini (SAIA/Siena) reports on the 6th season of research in the so called Byzantine quarter of the Pythion, which resulted in partial completion of an excavation initiated in 2002. Fieldwork concentrated in the W part of the area, immediately in front of the Temple of Pythian Apollo, where in the course of the 2007 campaign significant remains of a monumental building were discovered, presumably Rom but of uncertain function. The principal objective was to excavate this monument completely, dismantling the overlying remains of the LAntique and EByz periods, with the aim of understanding its original form and its transformation over time until its final disappearance from the urban landscape (Fig. 126). Excavation confirms the hypothesis advanced in 2007 that the building is square in plan with sides of 4.2m, contains a perfectly round interior space accessed via a door in the W side, which faces the Pythion, and has in the centre a large limestone cubic block, perhaps a statue base. From the doorway, one or two steps descend to the floor level. Of the original pavement only the foundation remains in the W half of the space; in the E half there is just beaten earth. Within this space numerous traces of activity were preserved - in particular, more than 35 lamps (many complete), several amphorae necks and jars set into the ground and burnt animal bones. The state of preserva tion of the building does not at present allow any convincing hypothesis to be developed about its reconstruction, not least because no traces of roof collapse are preserved inside the building. The date of the building is also a matter for conjecture, although the building technique and the lamps together indicate a date probably in the 2nd-3rd Ct AD.

In the last of these reuse phases, a wall was built against the edge of the building, incorporating several sculptural fragments, including a medium-sized marble statue preserving the torso and legs of a male figure partially covered by a chlamys closed by a fibula on the right shoulder. A preliminary identification of the figure is an Apollo of a type similar to that found at the Pythion, although other interpretations cannot be precluded in view of its state of preservation.

Demos of Gouves Skoteino cave. L. Tyree (ASCSA), A. Kanta (Herakleion Museum) and C. Davaras (Athens) continued the preparation for publication of the materialfrom Davaras' 1962 excavations in the cave. Over 3 seasons, the natural and cultural features in the cave have been planned conventionally, complemented by 3-D laser scanning to capture the complex physiography of the cave interior. On-site documentation includes geological and spele ological observations as well as ambient atmospheric measure ments. The fieldwork and study of the excavated material aims to understand the physical, historical and cultural uses of the cave from antiquity to mod. times. Demos of Herakleion Herakleion. To Vima (02/08/08), Kathimerini (05/08/08), Apogevmatini (04/08/08) and I Avgi (09/08/08) cite a press release of the Ministry of Culture (01/08/2008) concerning the discovery in the area of Bedenaki, between the sea wall and Sophokles Venizelos Street, in the course of works by the Herakleion Port Authority at Herakleion harbour, of a building complex with dual, defensive and religious, functions. This was originally a probable defensive tower which was transformed into a church in LByz times with the addition of an apse. Due to the density of burials in the floor of the church (12 to date) and the 2 arcosolia in the wall, it is likely that this was a burial chapel, a view strengthened by a section of wall-painting with a depiction of the Second Coming. In the apse of the shrine were preserved in situ parts of the procession of officiating dignitaries or priests, and to the W, part of a palm-bearer. The discovery of the wall paintings is significant as this is the 2nd ensemble in a town church, alongside those in the church of Ag. Petros of the Dominicans. The limits of the building complex have not yet been uncovered on the N, W and S sides. The 1567 map of Domenico Rosse da Este places the ruined Church of St Catarina E of Ag. Petros, towards the sea wall; it no longer appears on a map of 1570. Publication: A. Karetsou et al, a e : a a a a a (Herakleion, Nea Kriti 2008). Knossos Little Palace . E. Hatzaki (BSA/Cincinnati) reports on the 2008 study season. The earliest activity on site dates to EMIII-MMIA, represented by fill dumped in a shallow E-W ditch. The substantial landscaping of the FPalatial period (LMII LMIIIA2) eliminated all traces of Neopalatial occupation surfaces and obliterated the drain running of the Little Palace. This major landscaping is associated with white plaster floors on 2 levels bordered by an ashlar-faced wall running N-S and abutting the Little Palace fa?ade immediately of room 11. The space created was filled in, during 2 major dumping episodes represented by highly fragmented ceramics of the FPalatial-Postpalatial periods dating to LMIIIA2 and LMIIIB E, respectively. Neither deposit can be interpreted as redeposited destruction debris; further study of the faunal and archaeobotanical remains in relation to the ceramic material will clarify the nature of these dumps. The next building activity took place during the Postpalatial period (LMIIIB L LMIIIC), contemporary with renewed construction at the Stratigraphical Museum extension site to the W. Sections of the Little Palace fa?ade were demolished while others were incorporated into building 1 (previously designated the 'Re used Ashlar Building'). Most of the building's fa?ade and associated levels were removed during the EIA, but further disturbance of the shallow LMIIIC levels occurred during Evans' excavations. A succession of LMIIIC dumps in the narrow space created between the Neopalatial NE platform and the building 1 W fa?ade might be associated with the use of the latter. These levels were sealed by a paved court constructed one terrace up and associated with building 2, also dating to LMIIIC. The upper levels of building 2 were heavily disturbed by EIA activity but a small deposit of advanced LMIIIC (M or L?) implies some activity taking place outside this structure after its abandonment. The project is producing highly detailed datasets which will enable reassessment of the coarse stratigraphical picture available from the Little Palace and the rich and complex stratigraphy of the Minoan Unexplored Mansion, and be linked to the wider picture of LBA activities in the core ?lite sector of urban Knossos. Publication is planned in a series of articles in the Annual of the British School at Athens, the first of which, on the EIA levels, has appeared: E. Hatzaki, M. Prent, f N. Coldstream, D. Evely and A. Livarda, 'Knossos, the Little Palace North Project, part 1: the Early Greek periods' BSA 103 (2008), 235-89. Neolithic. V. Isaakidou (BSA/Sheffield) and P. Tomkins (BSA/Sheffield) report on study for publication of the material from the excavations of J.D. Evans (1959-1960,1969-1970) in and around the M palace. Studies of the faunal remains, chipped and ground-stone tools, and human figurines have been completed, while the ceramic study is close to completion. A digital archive of the excavation records has been compiled, and interim studies involving a range of questions and materials have been published in V. Isaakidou and P. Tomkins (eds), Escaping the Labyrinth: New Perspectives on the Neolithic of Crete (Oxford, Oxbow 2008). Palace. C. Macdonald (BSA/Edinburgh), C. Knappe? (BSA/Toronto) and I. Mathioudaki (Athens) completed the pre publication study of MMIII deposits from the palace at Knossos, in order to determine how the structure was transformed between the Protopalatial and Neopalatial periods. Study of ceramic deposits in their architectural contexts has clarified the relatively obscure MMIIIA and MMIIIB periods at</page><page sequence="94">94 TODD WHITELAW AND CATHERINE MORGAN Knossos, and indicates that, although the palace underwent important structural changes in MMIII, there was no wholesale rebuilding and redesigning, so it is not accurate to think of a 'New' palace replacing the Old'. The research will be published as a Supplementary Volume of the BSA. SW houses. C. Macdonald (BSA/Edinburgh) reports that study of the ceramics of 2 of the SW houses (S.V and S.VI) has been completed. This MMIB-II residential quarter was constructed on terraces descending SW from the palace. Complementing the 4 MMIB-IIA deposits published recently, smaller deposits of these periods have been studied throughout the SW houses, including a MMIB deposit from S.VI.4 with a clay 'pommel' sealing. Two successive MMIIIA deposits were studied in the N-S passage and in S.VII.4, where the later MMIIIA was associated with the earliest ashlar house wall outside the palace. Within S.VII, a large destruction deposit of LMII, belonging to the first phase of the building, was studied; it includes a large number of melon-shaped loomweights in a phyllitic fabric, probably not local. Knossos Urban Landscape Project (KULP). M. Bredaki (Director, 23rd EPCA), A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) and T. Whitelaw (BSA/London) report on the 3rd and final season of fieldwork, which focused on 4 different areas on the periphery of the central block of land surveyed in 2005 and 2007 (Fig. 127). The aim was to survey all of the landscape currently available for investigation which potentially may have been utilized for cemeteries or other outlying sites or activity foci relating to the urban site of Knossos, through all periods of its occupation. In 2007, investigation had concentrated on the areas of known cemeteries in the S part of the Knossos valley, within the protected alpha zone. Work in 2008 completed the coverage of the alpha zone, both to the E on the summit of Ailias and the prominent hill to the NE, and in the far SW. While the latter area extends well beyond the zone of previously known remains, low sherd densities and scattered tombs were identified, and the investigation was also intended to provide a basis for the effective management of the alpha zone in this area, as well as taking the coverage far enough from the urban site potentially to encounter small outlying sites and track how they responded to the expansion and contraction of the urban centre. The W boundary of the alpha zone runs along the ridge occupied by Fortetsa village, though the steep E-facing slope was not surveyed as the surface record is swamped by mod. debris deposited downslope from the village. In the S and SE, coverage was extended to the extensive quarries at Ag. Eirene (never systematically investigated) and to the SE of Spilia, to ensure that the Knossian mortuary landscape stopped at the Spilia gorge, rather than extending beyond it, along the access route into the valley from the S. To the N, the major focus of the year's work was the Kephala-Isopata ridge, known to have been used for high status burials in later prehistory. This area is outside the alpha zone, and so has reduced protection, and is also a fast-developing suburb of Herakleion. While it was not expected that undisturbed tombs would be detected through surface survey, it was essential that all available fields on the ridge be investi gated before they disappear beneath housing and other (for example, the new cemetery) developments. Coverage extended over the entire ridge and the slopes around the village of Kallithea, up to the national road and across it, to include the previously investigated Neo site at Katsambas. Some fields passed-by in either 2005 or 2007 were also surveyed, particu larly along the Kairatos river. Some 11,400 20m 20m grid units were surveyed, bringing to 21,000 the total investigated during the 3 years of fieldwork. Approximately 30% of the 2008 units (with 72,000 sherds) were preliminarily processed; the remainder will be sorted in 2009. In addition, it was possible to finish initial processing of the material collected during 2007. The field methods followed those used successfully in 2007, involving collection units defined on a 20m grid, located on the ground using satellite imagery and 1:5,000 maps, with positions checked every few squares by GPS. Where feasible, 2 20m transects were walked across each square, usually along a side and down the centre, to allow scanning of the entire unit for features. A transect lm w. was searched for material, so 40m2 (a 10% sample of the area in each unit) was intensively searched. Numerous features were encountered, including likely tombs (principally Rom, in the S of the study area), small rock shelters and the probable base of the Rom aqueduct, slightly upstream of the Ot aqueduct at Spilia. While a low density scatter of material of all periods was encountered over most of the investigated areas in 2008 (Fig. 128), the majority of the sherds recovered (ca. 57%), were of post-Rom date, not surprising given the amount of landscape surveyed in areas of new housing development. Some 23% of the pottery recovered was PH, primarily in light scatters flanking the Kairatos, probably representing cemeteries between those already known at Zafer Papoura, Sellopoulo, Kephala and Isopata. Two known areas of later PH occupation on the summit of Ailias were better defined. Deposition in the Hellenic to Rom periods is highly nucleated at the city, with few outlying scatters and relatively little material recovered in the peripheral areas surveyed this season (11% and 8% of material respectively). One small Rom concentration on the summit of Ailias is directly associated with the extensive limestone quarries, giving support to the Rom date hypothe sized in the past. The earlier glazed wares among the post-Rom pottery are concentrated below Fortetsa and along the Kephala Isopata ridge, where some etchings of the siege of Ven Cand?a (1648-1669) place the extensive Ot encampments. The 21,000 units investigated have yielded nearly 500,000 sherds and ca. 7,000 other finds. The 2008 season completed the surface collection phase of the project. Demos of Thrapsanos Galatas. G. Rethemiotakis (Herakleion Museum) reports on the 2008 excavation season at the M palace and town of Galatas, focused on buildings 6 and 7 S of the palace and building 1, some 100m E. Building 6 is a large, 300m2 building, most of which was excavated in 2007. The M hall and the adjacent lustral basin, as well as the building's location close to the W wing of the palace and the court with the baetyl, indicate its importance in the settlement. Some walls and a paved area at its SW corner are annexes to the enclosed space with the altar excavated in 2007. This area provided sound evidence for religious activity, the most spectacular object being a unique shrine model with a seated goddess figure inside. Building 7 is another large building of slightly smaller dimensions, badly preserved due to cultivation and erosion. Its walls are parallel to those of building 6, suggesting that both belonged to a unified building programme. The same orientation is repeated in other buildings which can be traced on the surface of the hilltop. According to the excavator, these represent a planned layout which involves large urban blocks</page><page sequence="95">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 95 127.

As documented by test pits along the exterior walls, the structures were constructed in MMIIIA, which means that the palace and the major urban buildings around it were erected as parts of a uniform building programme. To this period belong the contents of a room at the NW side of building 7 which contained many vases, domestic and finewares as well as a pithos, the inner walls of which were coated with lime. The floor make-up in the other rooms included sherds of EMI-IIA and MMIB. Small collections of Prepalatial pottery recovered from crevices in the bedrock mostly come from open shapes, namely thick-walled vases with incised concentric semicircles and herringbone patterns. Associated with the sherds, obsidian blades and flakes indicate craft activities on the spot. Building 1 is where the excavation started in 1992 (initial results are summarized in J. Driessen, I. Schoep and R. Lafflneur [eds], Monuments of Minos'. Rethinking the Minoan Palaces [Li?ge, Universit? de Li?ge 2002], 60-61). Excavation was resumed in this important and well-preserved building to obtain more evidence for its function and date. The area excavated, ca. 40m2, is only a small part of this large, well constructed and well-preserved urban house. Parts of 2 joining exterior walls at the NW corner and a partition wall were revealed. The latter wall is 1.7m h. with a marked inclination E, apparently the result of the earthquake which destroyed the building. The lower courses of the exterior walls used large boulders, but for the upper parts, fine ashlar blocks were employed, consistent with palatial standards. The associated pottery, which came from the upper floor, dates the destruction of the building to LMIA. The vessels comprise jars, amphorae, pithoid jars, jugs and many cups, all evidence of drinking on a large scale. Some fragments of stone libation tables and a vat model, an exact copy in miniature of the spouted vat of a wine press, may relate to some kind of religious activity. Evidence for the earlier use of the building is provided by the contents of the corridor between the W exterior and the partition wall. In this narrow space, no more than 5m2, were hundreds of densely packed MMIIIA vases, intact and broken. The vases had been discarded during a major reconstruction of the building which followed a catastrophic event at the very end of this period. After that, the doorway was blocked and the area remained out of use to the end of the building's life, providing an uncontaminated deposit. The consequences of the same event are attested in the palace: this is a major and uniform</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 97 destruction horizon involving building debris mixed with abundant MMIIIA pottery. After the destruction this material was reused as a fill underlying MMIIIB floors. Many types of vases are amply documented, involving finewares and coarsewares: shallow cups with out-turned rims, semi-globular and cylindrical cups (some with ribbed or grooved walls), basins, kalathoi, many tripod cooking pots, jugs, amphorae, miniature cups, chalices and kantharoi, some with crinkled rims, and a bird's nest cup-rhyton. More than 20 footed, circular, portable hearths, a type known from an MMII Phaistian cultic assemblage, testify to substantial religious activity inside the building. Many fragments of wall-plaster were discarded alongside the pottery in the same space. They come from pictorial wall-paintings with subjects similar to those previously reported, i.e. twigs with leaves in blue and a red 'net'. These fragments, along with those found in 1992 which belong to the same composition, date to MMIIIA. They are contemporary with the fragment of wall-painting excavated in the palace. Coming from uncontaminated deposits, these are the earliest well-dated fragments of pictorial wall-painting from Crete. In all likelihood MMIIIA was the great era of Galatas. Not only was a palace created out of nothing, but also splendid urban buildings were erected, luxuriously decorated with wall paintings probably by painters trained at Knossos. Galatas Survey. L.V. Watrous (Buffalo/ASCSA) reports on the first study season. Much of the PH, Byz, Ven and Ot pottery was restudied for the purposes of fabric analysis and dating. Ovicaprid and bovid bones from 2 Neo sites were identified. A total of 169 Neo-Ot sites were recorded on period maps. Regional developments during the BA were related to the history of the palatial site of Galatas. Pediadha Survey. N. Panaghiotakis and M. Panaghiotaki (University of the Aegean) report the completion of studies of the regional topography, geology, hydrology and botany; studies of pottery and clay analyses are well advanced. In recent years, field studies have focused on documenting the architectural remains on BA, Cl and Rom sites before they are destroyed through agriculture or illegal antiquities collecting. Demos of Tymbaki Agia Triada. V. La Rosa (SAIA/Catania) reports on the 2008 excavation season, which focused on the large stoa in the so called agora, which can be assigned to a late phase of LMIIIA2 (2nd half of the 14th CtBC). A reconstruction of the monument made in 2005 proposed the working hypothesis that the furthest 2 areas of the building and the steps at the limit were a late addition to the complex. To test this hypothesis, a trench was opened to the E of the steps to expose the foundation wall of the building which appears to be bonded with the E wall of the staircase. A 2nd trench, inside area VII, produced no indication in the bedrock for the existence of an earlier end wall that was later removed. At present, therefore, there is no evidence that the furthest 2 areas of the building were later extensions. Surface clearing in front of area VI of this building confirmed that the large wall with off-sets (of the start of LMIB) was already in ruins before the layout of the square in front of the stoa. A white-stuccoed channel which ran across the whole area was almost certainly connected with a workshop: the link with the various structures in the area suggests a construction date towards the end of the 15th Ct BC. Phaistos. M. Benzi (SA A/Pisa) reports on the 2 season of survey around the city and in the territory of Phaistos, conducted as a collaboration between the Universities of Pisa and Salerno and the 23rd EPCA. Mapping and georeferencing work was completed. Geo sherds were located on the summit and slopes of Marathovigla. Intensive survey was conducted in an area immediately NW of the cemetery of Ag. Pavlos and the village of Ag. Ioannis. Preliminary study of the results allows the recognition of a settlement quarter densely settled in the M period and again in Hel times. A significant discovery is a Cretan LGeo aryballos (end 8th-E7th Ct BC) preserved almost intact. For the study of the Cl and Hel city, great interest attaches to the discovery of 7 walls which define the contours in the area investigated. Their dimensions and lengths mean that none can be ascribed to buildings; one example represents the remains of the S city wall. Publication: O.

Sakellarakis (ASA) reports (Ergon [2008], 98 111) on continuing excavation of the M settlement, focused on room 15 and area 19 of the central building (plan: AR 53 [2006 2007], 112). The investigation of room 15 was almost completed. The room had an E entrance, a window in the W wall and 2 niches in the S wall. The floor was paved, and on it was found a large quantity of vessels of various types such as handleless conical cups, bridge-spouted and cylindrical cups, large and small lopades, kalathoi, amphoriskoi, braziers, prochoes, stirrup jars, chytres, vessel lids, pithoid vessels and lamps, which date to LMIA. It is likely that room 15 was used as a workshop to judge from the number and position of the vessels, from certain features and from the discovery of pieces of quartz (rock crystal). The latter is found in the area around Zominthos.

Giorgios on Kythera, the excavator proposes that natural, polyhedral crystals were used in certain M cult practices. In room 15, pieces of pyrolusite (manganese oxide) were also found; this has a semi-metallic sheen, comes from Melos and Lavrion, and can be used in the preparation of pigments and the production of porcelain. The excavator's view that room 15 was a workshop is strengthened by the discovery of tools such as grinders and obsidian blades. Three large cylindrical ceramic vessels with feet, decorated with the well-known M reed motif, were found in one of the 2 niches in the S wall (Fig. 129); these are similar in shape to stone vessels. All 3 have holes in the base and were used as rhyta. According to the excavator, 'the discovery of these vessels underlines the dual purpose of the foundation of the large central building at Psiloreite, at an elevation of 1,187m, namely industry and cult', noting also that it was located very close to the route leading to the Idaean cave. 129. Zominthos: rhyta from room 15. In area 19 of the central building, to the E of room 15, research concentrated in the E part. At some depth a wall of stone slabs was found, running from E to W and preserved to a height of 3 courses. Among the finds were 4 conical cups and fragments of other shapes such as kadoi and pithoid vessels, and beads of sard and agate. Demos of Arkadi Eleutherna Publications: T.

Strasser (ASCSA/Providence), P. Murray (ASCSA/Boston), E. Panagopoulou (EPSNE), C. Runnels (ASCSA/Boston) and N. Thompson (EPSNE) report on a survey which focused on finding pre-Neo remains on Crete. The Plakias and Ag. Pavlos coastal areas in the nomos of Rethymnon were selected because they have environmental characteristics that closely approximate the preferred site locations of Mes foragers as demonstrated by discoveries in Epirus, the Argolid, the Sporades, the Cyclades and Cyprus. Numerous gorges cut S to the Libyan Sea, with perennial streams that would have created extensive wetlands in the E Holocene as the sea level rose. In addition, many local fault scarps have caves and rock-shelters, usually associated with springs, suitable for habitation. Survey focused on limestone caves near freshwater estuaries in regions where the present shoreline is near the E Holocene sea level. Fieldwork targeted paleosols where Pleistocene and E Holocene remains are likely to be preserved. Using these criteria, 18 lithic scatters were found and a sample of 1,764 stone artefacts collected. Small artefacts of Mes type were found at all but 3 of the sites, and large tools of Pal type were found at 4 sites. The project found Mes sites in coastal regions where freshwater streams and rivers entered the Libyan Sea (i.e. the Damnoni, Ammoudi, Schinaria, Preveli and Ag. Pavlos regions). The Plakias Mes surface remains are similar to assemblages from Franchthi cave, Klisoura cave 1, Sidari, Kandia and Maroulas. The assemblages primarily consist of microlithic (ca. 0.01-0.04m) flakes struck from small pebbles of quartz and chert by direct percussion (Fig. 130). Flakes of different sizes were then retouched, often on multiple edges. Retouch, uniformly small and discontinuous, is seen also on the cores and on debitage of all sizes and shapes, suggesting somewhat expedient use of raw materials. Differences among the assemblages may have chronological or functional signifi cance. Chert artefacts were more plentiful at the sites around Damoni, Ammoudi and Ag. Pavlos, and quartz was the preferred raw material at the sites from Schinaria and Preveli. The lithic scatters appear to represent temporary or seasonal campsites. Only at Damnoni 3 was evidence observed for possible activities other than flaked stone production and use: 2 or 3 possible circular stone features were located on a low shelf directly below the mouth of the cave. 130. Plakias: Mes flakes.</page><page sequence="99">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 99 131. Plakias: Pal hand-axes. Three to 4 sites believed to date to the Lower Pal were identified in locations similar to the Mes sites, to facilitate hunting strategies incorporating access to fresh water and outcrops of raw material. The S-facing cliffs of the Preveli gorge had 2 to 3 sites. Two scatters are close together and after further analysis may be combined. Another site was found on the E side of the Kotsiphos gorge in an area that remains to be thoroughly investigated. The Pal assemblages employ mostly dull, opaque and blocky quartz, often poorer in quality than that used in Mes times, which is translucent, lustrous and fine-grained. Use of other materials is suggested by a quartzite biface fragment from Preveli 2. The Pal industry is distinguishable from the Mes by the larger size of the cores, debitage, flakes and tools, which are typically 0.08m to more than 0.15m /. (Fig. 131). There are also technological differences: cores are typically unidirec tional, bifacial or flat with centripetal flaking. Flakes were the desired end products of the reduction strategy, averaging about 0.08m in size and very thick (typically 0.035-0.045m) with broad and sometimes dihedral platforms up to 0.03-0.04m w. The retouched tool types are distinctive and include bifaces, hand-axes, cleavers, side scrapers, double converging denticu lates, pointed flakes, truncations, denticulates, burins and Clactonian notches on flakes. There was good reason to believe that Mes material would be found on Crete, since sites have been discovered on Kythnos, Youra, Alonnissos and Cyprus. The Lower Pal Acheulean tools are surprising, though lithics of all phases of the Pal have recently been reported from Gavdos. Since Crete has been an island since the Messinian Event almost 6 million years ago, early hominids had to use a sea-craft to reach Crete. This pushes back the evidence for early sea-faring in the Mediterranean to at least 250,000 years ago, and possibly much earlier. WESTERN CRETE (Nomos of Chania) Community of Gavdos Gavdos. Siopata-Katalymata. K. Kopaka (University of Crete) reports on excavations at Katalymata near Siopata, in the complex of about 450m2 explored in recent years. Its main period of habitation is LBI, when it was destroyed, very probably by an earthquake, and partly burnt. MBA pottery and some architectural remains are also present. This building hosted mixed activities, as shown by its rich contents, whether fallen or in situ. Storage, grinding and pounding, and more specialized industrial work, perhaps related to perfume, metal and pottery manufacture, were certainly among them. The pottery is mainly locally made and includes pithoi, jars, basins, cooking pots, dishes, jars and many jugs and/or amphorae, but few cups, as well as some small, nicely decorated eye-jugs (Fig. 132) reminiscent of Cyc ones, and at least one small stirrup jar. Local clays are generally soft to medium hard, pale and gritty, and the coarse fabrics recall Cretan oatmeal fabric. Despite its obvious M style, the pottery shows long-lasting and conservative local technical and aesthetic features. Thus, handmade vases and pushed-through handles are dominant throughout the 2nd millennium BC, and there is a clear preference for glossy surfaces, often painted with vivid orange-red colours, and with familiar, repeated motifs (for example, crosses, pairs of spirals, groups of pendent semicircles and wavy lines etc.) which point to a Gavdiot workshop. Among other finds are small stone vases and several stone and clay lids, a few bronze items, and jewellery, including beads in faience, Egyptian blue, rock crystal, steatite, agate 132.

Two seals have been recovered: a MBIII-LBI 'talismanic' seal in veined agate, with a finely executed sailing boat, and a small discoid seal in steatite with random scratching or a cross with filling. All this reflects considerable comfort in the life of the users of the Katalymata building (Fig. 134), and general prosperity in the life of Gavdos; both conditions must be linked to the contemporary cultural acme of Minoan Crete. Demos of Souda Aptera Publication (in Greek and English): V. Niniou-Kindeli, A e (Crete, 35th EPCA 2008) Demos of Sphakia Loutro. P. Mortensen (Copenhagen) presents a brief account (Antiquity On-line Project Gallery http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ ProjGall/mortensen/index.html) of lithics collected at ca. 150 220masl on the surface of redeposited sediments. Twenty one individual bifacially and unifacially modified cobbles and flakes of coarse white to reddish-brown chert and limestone are described. Consideration is given to the possibility that these are naturally produced 'geofacts', but the pattern of flaking, presence of bulbs of percussion and probable prepared platform on one example, are argued to demonstrate that they are artefacts. The forms represented include choppers, flakes, picks, points, scrapers and a hand-axe. Typologically, the artefacts can be compared with L Lower Pal and E MPal assemblages from Africa and S Europe.</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2008-2009 SOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS Archaeological Institute for Aegean Studies 108-110 Archaeological Institute for Epirotic Studies 88-89 ASA 6, 26-29, 38-39, 47-54, 56-58, 129 ASCSA 1-5, 7-9,11-21, 55, 83-86, 130-131 Austrian Institute 40-41, 65-66, 69-70, 112-113 Belgian School 120-123 BSA 10, 42-46, 78-80,104-107,124, 127-128 Canadian Institute 22, 73 DAI cover, 33-36, 59-62, 71-72 EfA 23-25, 93-98, 102-103, 119 Finnish Institute 37, 63-64, 87 INSTAP-EC (P.
