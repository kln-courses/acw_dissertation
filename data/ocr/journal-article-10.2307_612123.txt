<plain_text><page sequence="1">V. DI6SZEGI (ed.): Glaubenswelt und Folklore der sibirischen Volker. 534 pp. Budapest: Akademiai Kiad6, 1963. $14. This volume is dedicated to the memory of the Hungarian scholar and explorer Antal Reguly (1819-58). Between 1843 and 1847 he travelled extensively among the Uralic peoples of the north, on both sides of the Ural, and collected a vast amount of linguistic and ethnographical material pertaining principally to the Voguls, the Ostiaks, and the Samoyedes. Unfortunately, these arduous journeys ruined Reguly's health and he died young, before he could publish the results of his investigations. Much of the material collected by him was published after his death, but some of his manuscripts remain unedited. No explanation is given as to why 1963 was chosen for the publication of this memorial volume. But why should we pry into the reasons of the publication, when the result is as satisfactory as it is in this case? We have in our hands a very valuable and lavishly pro- duced volume, devoted to various aspects of the spiritual civilization of northern Eurasia, from the Lapps in the west, to the Giljaks and Eskimos in the east. The 28 articles composing the volume are mostly by Hungarian and Soviet scholars, although Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Sweden are also represented by a total of four contributions. All the articles are in German and, according to a note in tiny print on the verso of the title-page, were translated from Hungarian by Dr. G. Engl. It is thus likely that the Russian contributions reach us through the media of two translations. Be that as it may, the translator has done excellent work, and the unity of style resulting from one man being in charge of all the trans- lations, is most welcome.</page><page sequence="2">656 REVIEWS As it is to be expected, the quality of the articles is very uneven. At the lowest level stands L. Mandoki's thoroughly uninformed study on Asiatische Sternnamen (pp. 519-32), and in a volume dedicated to the memory of Antal Reguly one would have liked to find a biography of Reguly less superficial than that given by J. Kodolanyi jr. (pp. 17-28). Between these two articles-the first and the last of the volume-are sandwiched the other contribu- tions, grouped according to geographical principles, with articles having a general theme placed at the end of the book. I give a short synopsis of these contributions. An article by E. Manker on drum-magic among the Lapps (pp. 29-44) is followed by two articles on Hungarian shamanism by B. Gunda (pp. 45-56) and J. Balazs (pp. 57-84). Both are interesting and well documented. Six articles deal with the Ugrians of the Ob. The first of these, by E. I. Rombandeeva, is based on personal observation of Vogul customs connected with child-birth (pp. 85-92). B. KAlmAn examines two cleansing-rites connected with bear-ceremonialism (pp. 93- 100), V. Moshinskaja shows some very inter- esting anthropomorphic representations from Western Siberia (pp. 101-10), J. KodolAnyi jr. describes Ostiak granaries used for the housing of sacrificial offerings (pp. 111-14). W. Steinitz (pp. 115-19) and E. Vertes (pp. 121-30) publish Ostiak texts with translations. G. D. Verbov gives an eyewitness account of a Samoyede funeral (pp. 131-3), L. Galdi analyses the metrical structure of some sha- manistic Samoyede songs (pp. 135-47), whereas A. A. Popov (pp. 149-59) and P. Hajdri (pp. 161-90) deal with other aspects of Samoyede shamanism. Bear-worship among the Ket is the subject of J. A. Alekseenko's contribution (pp. 191-208). Five articles deal with the beliefs of Turkic peoples. G. A. Jusupov searches for traces of totemism among the Tatars of Kazan (pp. 209-22), L. P. Potapov gives first-hand evidence on shaman-drums used in the Altai (pp. 223-56). N. P. Dyrenkova's short notice (pp. 257-9) concerns the protection by magic of the children of the Shor. The editor of the volume, V. Di6szegi, gives a splendidly docu- mented survey of Tofa (Karagas) shamanism (pp. 261-357). The title of his contribution, 'Zum Problem der ethnischen Homogenitat des tofischen (karagassischen) Schamanismus ', is somewhat misleading. Di6szegi visited the Tofa in 1958 and he gives a detailed account- with excellent photographs, drawings, and coloured illustrations-of the Tofa shaman's paraphernalia and their manufacture. S. I. Weinstein reports on the vivification of the shaman-drum among the Tuva (pp. 359-67). Four articles, two of them by G.M. Vasilevich (pp. 369-404) are devoted to Tunguz sha- manism. The Evenki songs she publishes in text and translation are particularly valuable. (The editor of the volume must be congratu- lated for retaining the original Russian translations made by Mme. Vasilevich.) It is regrettable that V. A. Avrorin chose to give only the translation and not also the text of a Nanaj shamanistic tale (pp. 405-14). Another contribution by V. Di6szegi (pp. 415-36) deals with Nanaj amulets. Of the two articles devoted to the Giljaks, the first, by Ch. M. Taksami (pp. 437-52), is based on first-hand observation of various religious rites; the second article, although interesting, is somewhat out of place in this volume. In it, V. S. Panfilov examines Giljak personal names (pp. 453-61). G. A. Menovshchikov (the trans- literation Menowstschikow used in the book is inadmissible) publishes some personal observa- tions on the civilization of the Asiatic Eskimos (pp. 463-81). I. Paulson (pp. 483-90) focuses his attention on the custom of preserving the bones of game, O. Nahodil (pp. 491-511) speaks of Mutterkult in Siberia. Finally, V. I. Matjushchenko presents a few attractive stone statuettes found in the region of the mouth of the river Tom (pp. 513-18). I could have no other aim but to give an idea of the rich contents of this book. To select a few articles for critical comment would have been invidious. It can be said that the most valuable contributions are those, and they are many, which give new, first-hand information on shamanistic practices. The theoretical articles seem somewhat old-fashioned. An index would have greatly enhanced the usefulness of this book which, as I have already said, is a major contribution to the subject and probably the most beautifully produced book that has ever been published on sha- manism. The printing works of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences which produced this book must be congratulated. DENIS SINOR</page></plain_text>
