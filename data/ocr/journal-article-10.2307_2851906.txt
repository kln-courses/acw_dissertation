<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECULUM A JOURNAL OF MEDIAEVAL STUDIES Vol. XLVI JULY 1971 No. 3 BEOWULF AND THE BOOK OF ENOCH* BY R. E. KASKE I suppose it would be generally admitted these days that the interpretation of Old English literature can often draw profitably upon Christian Latin writing of the first millennium: the Latin Bible and its commentaries, the New Testament apocrypha, and the enormous and varied corpus of patristic and later Latin lit- erature. In addition, there are occasional signs that Old English poetry - learned and unusually early as it is - may owe something to a colorful body of writings no longer current in the later Middle Ages, which for present purposes can be conveniently labelled "Old Testament apocrypha." I refer, of course, not to books like Tobias, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, and I and II Macha- bees, which in the Middle Ages were generally accepted as canonical, but to what one is tempted to call the "real apocrypha," or more conventionally the pseud- epigrapha - for example the Book of Jubilees, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Book of Adam and Eve, the Assumption of Moses, and so on.l Often enough, it would appear, such works have been permanently lost; witness the greatly lamented "Liber de Ogia nomine gigante," known to us only through a disapproving reference in the sixth-century Decretum Gelasianum.2 Sometimes they survive in early Greek or Latin translations or fragments, but usually the only complete early versions we possess are in languages calculated to dampen the enthusiasm of the honest Anglo-Saxonist - Ethiopic, Syriac, Armenian, Slavic, and the like. Even so, books of this kind seem to have had some currency in Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, presumably in early Latin translations * This study was presented as a brief paper before the Old English Group at the meeting of the Modern Language Association of America, 28 December 1969; an abstract appears in the "Old English Newsletter" published by that group, III, 2 (Feb. 1970), 5. The present article is indebted to Professor Thomas D. Hill of Cornell University for many valuable suggestions and pieces of information. 1 For translations, introductions, and detailed apparatus, see The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament in English, ed.

R. James remarked long ago, "the Anglo-Saxon and Irish scholars seem to have been in possession of a good deal of rather rare apocryphal literature."3 The most famous and influential of all these Old Testament apocrypha is the eschatological work known as the Book of Enoch (or I Enoch), apparently a product of many hands, written in Hebrew and/or Aramaic during the first two centuries before Christ. After what seems to have been a considerable popularity in the early Church, it fell into general disrepute in the fourth century and after - so much so that the complete text survives only in Ethiopic, along with size- able fragments of an antecedent Greek text and some further fragments in Aramaic that have been discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.4 One may well ask, then, how so seemingly exotic a work, or even material from it, could possibly have come to the attention of an eighth-century English poet. There are, to begin with, several shreds of evidence that in themselves could hardly be called conclusive. For example, Bede's comment on Jude vv. 14-15 includes a fairly detailed discussion of the veracity of the Book of Enoch; and though the passage is clearly based on a similar discussion by Augustine in De civitate Dei, it does at least raise the question of whether Bede may not have also known the Book of Enoch directly.5 Again, the distinctive theme of the "seven archangels" - an idea clearly derived from the Book of Enoch - turns up in the Book of Cerne, an eighth-century Anglo-Saxon prayerbook;6 and the name of one of these angels, Raguel, appears in the tenth-century Durham Col- 3 "A Fragment of the 'Penitence of Jannes and Jambres'," Journal of Theological Studies, In (1901), 577. There is, of course, always the possibility that some works may have gained at least a limited currency in seventh- and eighth-century England directly through Greek versions. See for example M. Roger, L'enseigne-ment des lettres classiques d'Ausone a Alcuin (Paris, 1905), pp. 388-91; M. R. James, "Greek Manuscripts in England Before the Renaissance," The Library, Ser. 4, vii (1927), 338-40; and F. M. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (2nd ed.; Oxford, 1947), pp. 181-82. 4 Ethiopic text, ed.

By happy chance, however, a manuscript in the British Museum includes a twenty-five-line fragment of what was evidently a Latin translation of the Book of Enoch; and by still happier chance, this manuscript seems to have originated in England during the eighth century.9 This slender remnant, pointing strongly to the availability of the Book of Enoch in Latin somewhere in England and during the probable century of Beowulf, will allow us to take seriously any convincing parallels that can be found between the two works. In Beowulf,10 it seems clear that whatever may be the ultimate origin of Gren- del and his mother, Grendel is developed in large part as one of the notorious Old Testament giants, who, according to common tradition, were born of the union between the filii Dei and filiwo hominum recorded in Gen. vi.2.11 These giants are of course particularly prominent in the Book of Enoch,12 where their portrayal seems in various ways to correspond to that of Grendel. An in- itial resemblance is established by the fact that both are presented as violent eaters of human flesh; though the cannibalism of the giants is mentioned in cer- tain other early works, it is worth recalling that the original and apparently 7 The Book of Enoch, xx.4 (BE, p. 43; EV, pp. 52-53), calls him "one of the holy angels who takes vengeance on the world of the luminaries"; the Greek text (BE, p. 296; EV, p. 53) has " 'Pa7ov)7X, 6 els rvV a&amp;yiv aeyY'Xo v 6 ELK&amp;i^ rbv KOO-UW Trv T(orrOTpwv." The reference in the Durham Collectar, ed. A. Hamilton Thompson and U. Lindelof, Rituale Ecclesiae Dunelmensis (Surtees Society Publ., cxL; Durham, 1927), p. 198, is "Raguel id est fortis id est satahel," with the OE gloss, "pct is strong pcet is satahel." An allusion to the angel Raguel here, though less than certain, seems much more probable than a reference to any of the Biblical persons of that name (Ex. ii.18, Num. x.29, and particularly Tob. iii.7 et passim). I owe this idea, along with its documentation, to the generosity of Professor Hill. 8 See for example Robert J. Menner, "The Vasa Mortis Passage in the Old English Salomon and Saturn," Studies in English Philology: A Miscellany in Honor of Frederick Klaeber, ed. Kemp Malone and Martin B.

James, Apocrypha Anecdota: A Collection of Thirteen Apocryphal Books and Fragments (Texts and Studies: Contributions to Biblical and Patristic Litera- ture, ii, 3; Cambridge, 1893), pp. 146-50. The fragment is a condensed version of ch. 106 (BE, pp. 264-68; EV, pp. 219-22). James, p. 150, remarks, ". . . there seems no reason to doubt that it is an extract from a complete Latin version of the Book of Enoch"; for the opposite view, which seems to have won no great acceptance, see Lawlor, "Early Citations," particularly pp. 175, 223-25. 10 References to Beowulf throughout are to Beowulf and Judith, ed.

And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood.3 We may notice in passing Beowulf's prediction about the dying Grendel - Daer abidan sceal maga mane fah miclan domes, hu him scir metod scrifan wille (977b-979) -which, though far from unique in references to the Last Judgment, would be plausible enough as an adaptation of the fate of the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch: And, when their sons have slain one another, and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated.l4 A more striking correspondence between Beowulf and the Book of Enoch can be found in the diversity and apparent contradictoriness of the epithets applied to Grendel. On the one hand, he is characterized straightforwardly as a giant by epithets like eoten (761) and Pyrs (426), and by the reference to Beowulf's watch against him as an eotonweard (668).15 Again, there are a number of epithets that seem to define him as some sort of evil spirit: ellengcst (86), grimma gcst (102), werga gdst (133), ellorgdst/ellorgcst (807, 1349), geosceaftgdst (1266), welgSst (1995), and gdst yrre (2073). And finally, he is conceived of repeatedly as a devil or demon in expressions like feond on helle (101), helrune (163), helle gdst (1274), and deofol (1680), as well as in the description of his companions as deofla gedraeg 13 vii.2-5; BE, p. 18 (EV, pp. 16-17). For later references to the giants' cannibalism, all apparently derived either immediately or ultimately from the Book of Enoch, see the Book of Jubilees, v.1-2, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, II, 20; the Clementine Homilies, vmI (n), xvi, 2, ed.

Bouterwek, "Das Beowulflied: Eine Vorlesung," Germania: Viertel- jahrsschrift fur deutsche Alterthumskunde, I (1856), 401, remarked, "Menschenfressende Riesen kennt das germanische Heidenthum nicht, dagegen spielen sie in einer fur die Damonenlehre sehr wichtigen ... apokryphischen Schrift, dem Buche Eniochs ... eine sehr bedeutende Rolle." 14 x.l2; BE, pp. 24-25 (EV, pp. 28-29).

A passage in the Book of Enoch presents just such an apparent ambiguity between "giant" and "spirit" or "evil spirit": And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men, and from the holy Watchers [i.e., the angels] is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called.... And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst, and cause offences. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them.17 As Charles explains, "The union of angels and the daughters of men will give birth to a new order of beings, i. e. giants, and from these giants when they die will proceed evil spirits, i. e. demons, and these will have the earth for their hab- itation."'8 This extension of the careers of the giants as evil spirits or demons is found in a few early works, all depending somehow on the Book of Enoch;19 only in the Book of Enoch itself, however, have I found so elaborate and sug- gestive a juxtaposition of the concepts "giant" and "evil spirit (demon)." If these suggestions are reasonable enough to be entertained, they may in turn help to reveal some surprising connotations in the mysterious name "Grendel" - particularly in view of the Beowulf-poet's evident fondness for meaningful names, exemplified in "Unferp," "Wonred," "Hygelac," and "Hygd."20 There is of course abundant evidence in Old English land documents for the currency of 16 On the description of Grendel as a devil, see Emerson, "Legends of Cain," pp. 880-82; and Klaeber, "Die christlichen Elemente im Beowulf, II," pp. 250-57, who summarizes (p. 250), "Wenn- schon daneben als riesisch, menschlich (gelegentlich sogar mit heroischem Anflug), und allgemein gespenstisch gezeichnet, wird er doch mit besonderem Nachdruck als teuflisches Wesen vorgeftihrt." 17 xv.8-9,11-12; BE, pp. 36-37 (EV, pp. 42-45). In the Greek text (BE, pp. 292-93; EV, pp. 43, 45), "giants" is expressed by "yL^yavTe," and "evil spirits" by "'rveutara 7rov7pa&amp;." 18 BE, p. 36, note on xv.8-9. 19 Athenagoras, Legatio pro Christianis, 25 (PG 6, cols. 948-49); Clementine Homilies, viII (), xviii (ed. cit., I, 128-29); Georgius Syncellus, Chronographia (ed. cit., i, 46); and apparently Jerome, Comm. in Isaiam, viII, on Is. xxvi.14 (PL 24, col. 300): "Possumus mortuos simulacra appellare hominum mortuorum, et gigantes daemones, qui simulacris eorum assident." Justin, Tertullian, and Lactantius all present the offspring of the angels directly as spirits or demons without mentioning the giants. 20 For "Unfer]," see Morton W. Bloomfield, "Beowulf and Christian Allegory: An Interpretation of Unferth," Traditio, VIi (1949-51), 410-15, and the more convincing recent explanation by Fred C.

Creed (Birmingham, Alabama, 1970), pp. 43-48; for "Wonred," Bloomfield, p. 414, and Robinson, p. 45; and for "Hygelac" and "Hygd," my sugges- tion in " 'Hygelac' and 'Hygd', " Studies in Old English Literature in Honor of Arthur G. Brodeur, ed. Stanley B. Greenfield (Eugene, Oregon, 1963), pp. 200-06, with the important modification and fur- ther evidence presented by Fred C.

Professor Robinson's entire article ibidd., pp. 14-58) is a brilliant introduction to the use of meaningful names in Old English literature generally.</page><page sequence="6">426 Beowulf and the Book of Enoch the name "Grendel" in place-names, like grendeles pyt and Orendles mere;21 but I suppose it is always possible either that such names themselves allude to the Grendel of the poem, or that the poet has chosen to read significance into an already existing name - as, apparently, in his treatment of the name "Hy- gelac."22 If the name "Grendel" is looked at analytically, its first syllable can be connected more or less plausibly with Old English words like grindan, "to grind," or grund, "bottom (of a mere)";23 but its final "-el" remains unexplained. In the Book of Enoch a catalogue of nineteen fallen angels who mated with mortal women to produce the giants includes sixteen names ending in the familiar word transliterated as l, which in Hebrew designates such divinities: "And these are the names of their leaders: Samiazaz, their leader, Arakiba, Rameel, Kkabiel, Tamiel, Ramiel, Danel, Ezeqeel, Baraqijal, Asael, Armaros, Batarel, Ananel, Zaqtel, Samsapeel, Satarel, Tfrel, Jm'ael, Sariel."24 In any translation, such names might be expected to remain basically unchanged; witness the Greek text on which the Ethiopic presumably depends, where - despite substantial differ- ences within this catalogue of names in our two extant manuscripts - the final el"1 appears consistently as "-_X."25 If the Book of Enoch was indeed somehow part of the cultural repertory of the Beowulf-poet, may it not be that the name "Grendel" (whether invented by the poet or creatively incorporated from else- where) is used in the poem with an awareness of its latent significance: an Old English word of dire connotations, augmented by a final "-el" as a further hint of Grendel's apocryphal ancestry?26 To this whole pattern of suggested correspondences between Grendel and the giants of the Book of Enoch, there is at least one major objection. In the Book of Enoch, as in Jewish and early Christian tradition generally, the union of the "sons of God" and "daughters of men" in Gen. vi.2 is understood as a mating of certain angels with mortal women; in Christian exegesis from the time of Au- gustine onward, it is more commonly explained as a mating of men from the race of Seth with women from the race of Cain. The Beowulf-poet, of course, refers explicitly and repeatedly to Grendel's descent from Cain (102-114, 1258-1267), without ever mentioning the fallen angels who are so emphatically the fathers of the giants in the Book of Enoch. Even so, there seems to be no reason why he may not have had in mind a sequence of events in which the angels mated with 21 R. W. Chambers, Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem, ed. C. L. Wrenn (3rd ed.; Cambridge, 1959), pp. 305-08. 2 See "'Hygelac' and 'Hygd'," p. 205; and Robinson, "Significance of Names," pp. 53, 57. 23 Chambers, Beowulf, pp. 309-10. 2i vi.7; BE, p. 16 (EV, pp. 14-15).

Bouterwek, "Das Beowulflied," p. 401, adds to his remarks about the Book of Enoch (note 13 above), "Hineintragen aus fremder Sage scheint auch der Name Grendel zu verrathen, der m6glicherweise einem orientalischen nachgebildet ist."</page><page sequence="7">Beowulf and the Book of Enoch 427 women who were themselves from the house of Cain,27 thus using both traditions without doing violence to either. Any conviction produced by my preceding sug- gestions will of course add to the credibility of some such conflation. I turn now to Grendel's mother. If, as I have proposed, Grendel himself is to be somehow identified with the Old Testament giants, it seems logical to expect that his mother might be similarly associated with the filice hominum who bore them. So far as I know, the eventual fate of these "daughters of men" is re- corded nowhere except in the Book of Enoch, where the angel Uriel tells Enoch that they are to be turned into "sirens": C"m alt L yvLKES aiVr&amp;v Trv IrapafavrTwv a&amp;yyyeXwv els aetLpvas 'yevraovraL."2 In itself this announcement may appear to leave us little the wiser, since the very conduct of Grendel's mother in the poem seems to indicate that whatever she may be she is certainly no siren. In Hel- lenistic Jewish tradition, however, and so also in patristic literature, sirens ap- pear frequently as spectral wanderers in the wasteland, as the companions of demons, and as violent flesh-eating monsters.29 In several passages of the Old Testament (notably the famous prophecies of desolation in Isaias and Jeremias), Hebrew terms for she-ostriches and jackals are rendered by the Septuagint trans- lators as "artpvrvs"930 - who in context thus become solitary monsters of the 27 Emerson, "Legends of Cain," p. 921, assumes that this is the situation implicit in all explanations by way of the angels and mortal women: "For our purpose it is sufficient to note that, whatever inter- pretation was taken [i.e., that of the angels and mortal women, or that of the sons of Seth and the daughters of Cain], the children of Cain were included, and the giants were therefore descendants of Abel's murderer." The mating of angels with women from the house of Cain appears explicitly in an early ninth-century Hebrew redaction of earlier material, Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer (The Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer the Great), trans. Gerald Friedlander (New York, 1965), pp. 159-61. 28 xix.2, "And the women also of the angels who went astray shall become sirens." Greek, BE, p. 296, EV, p. 51; trans., BE, p. 43. All modern editors and translators agree that the Ethiopic text -which seems to correspond to a hypothetical Greek reading Ws elprJvalaL, "as peaceful ones" - is of no authority.

The Second Vatican Mythographer, ch. 101, ed G. H.

T. Northcote Toller (Oxford, 1898), p. 680, "mlere-men(n)" and "mere-menen." The twelfth-century Hortus deliciarum by Herrad of Landsberg, the original of which is no longer extant, contained a gloss equating Sirenes with MHG Merwib, the cognate of OE merewif; see Christian Moritz Engelhardt, Herrad von Lands- perg ... und ihr Werk: Hortus deliciarum (Stuttgart, 1818), p. 195. It seems obvious, however, that this gloss must have accompanied Herrad's illustration of Ulysses and the Sirens, repr. Joseph Walter, ed., Hortus deliciarum (Strasbourg, 1952), pl. XXXIX, which follows the Classical conception of the Sirens as having wings and birdlike feet. The usual OHG gloss for sirenes is merimanni, merimenni, etc.; see most of the references assembled by Otto Groger, Die althochdeutsche und altsiichsische Kompositionsfuge, mit Verzeichnis der althochdeutschen und altsdchsischen Composita (Zirich, 1911), p. 395, "meri-manni." 35 Cf.

Swylc wses peaw hyra, haepenra hyht; helle gemundon 180 in modsefan, metod hie ne cupon, dseda demend, ne wiston hie drihten god, ne hie huru heofena helm herian ne cupon, wuldres waldend.

(175-188) In the Book of Enoch, the transformation of the women into sirens is immediately preceded by Uriel's prophecy that the giants will somehow lead men to sacrifice to demons: And Uriel said to me: "Here shall stand the angels who have connected themselves with women, and their spirits [i.e., those of the giants] assuming many different forms are defiling mankind and shall lead them astray into sacrificing to demons as gods.... "36 If this pronouncement is taken to mean simply that the giants taught or seduced men to sacrifice to demons, our passage in Beowulf might take on added thematic relevance as a reminder of one more way in which mankind has been harmed by Grendel and his ilk. If on the other hand it is taken to mean that men resorted to such sacrifices in order to escape the persecution of the giants, the situation will correspond exactly to that in Beowulf. Lines 178b-183a, usually understood as detailing the Danes' ignorance of the true God, remain the same sort of problem under this interpretation that they have always been; their difficulty, that is, springs not from any clash with these possible references to the Book of Enoch, but from their apparent lack of agreement with the picture of Hro5gar and the Danes elsewhere in the poem.37 In any case, within the frame of reference 36 xix.1; BE, p. 42 (EV, pp. 50-51). 87 Even this contradiction, however, strikes me as less inevitable than is usually assumed. For ex- ample, it seems at least possible to take fieaw hyra (178b) as a reference to the Danes' usage during the extended period of Grendel's ravages, rather than to their permanent custom; to understand haeenra hyht (179a) not as a simple repetition of the idea of fieaw hyra with hwaenra referring to the Danes themselves, but as a disparaging comment characterizing feaw hyra as identical with the behavior of heathens; to interpret ne cufon (180b), ne wiston (181b), and herian ne cujon (182b) as allusions to the sinners' not "knowing" God or "knowing how" to praise Him; and to paraphrase 11. 178b-182b somewhat as follows: "Such was their practice during that period- the same hope indulged in by the heathens. In their hearts they now remembered only things of hell; they had not in mind the Ruler, the Judge of deeds, they took no thought of the Lord God, nor - this being so - was it at all in their capacity to praise the Protector of the heavens ...." Such a meaning in these lines is of course less obvious than the simple declaration that the Danes did not know God, and I do not suppose it could be preferred if the lines existed in isolation; in the context of the poem, however, it has the great advantage of eliminating an apparent major discrepancy.</page><page sequence="10">430 Beowulf and the Book of Enoch I have been suggesting, the condemnation in lines 183b-186a might best be under- stood as a judgment on Grendel himself, with the word sawle (184b) construed as a plural referring to the souls of men at large: "Woe be to him who shall, through cruel persecution, shove souls into the fire's embrace, etc." In this connection, it is worth noticing that the expression Wa bi' (183b)- admittedly a commonplace in Scripture and elsewhere-is paralleled thirty-two times within a few chapters in the latter part of the Book of Enoch, sometimes with potential appropriateness for Grendel and his activities: Woe to you, ye obstinate of heart, who work wickedness and eat blood.... Woe to them who work unrighteousness and help oppression, And slay their neighbors until the day of the great judgement.... Woe to you, sinners, on the day of strong anguish, Ye who afflict the righteous and burn them with fire....38 The contrasting but apparently irrelevant commendation of the good in lines 186b-188b might then be at least partly accounted for by the fact that such brief emphatic juxtapositions of the fates of the good and the wicked-again, of course, a commonplace in both Old and New Testaments-are also a marked feature of the latter part of the Book of Enoch, often involving parts of the "Woe to-" formula: And the spirits of you who have died in righteousness shall live and rejoice, And their spirits shall not perish, nor their memorial from before the face of the Great One Unto all the generations of the world; wherefore no longer fear their contumely. Woe to you, ye sinners, when ye have died.... Know ye, that their souls will be made to descend into Sheol And they shall be wretched in their great tribulation. And into darkness and chains and a burning flame where there is grievous judgement shall your spirits enter; And the great judgement shall be for all the generations of the world. Woe to you, for ye shall have no peace.39 If the Danes' demon-worship and the Wa biY passage (183b-186a) can indeed be explained in somewhat the way I have suggested, and if the Book of Enoch is accordingly supposed to supply part of the context for this part of the poem, one function of the apparently superfluous Wel biU passage (186b-188b) might be to develop that context to recognizeable proportions by reflecting a pattern common in the Book of Enoch. Though I would suspect the judgment of anyone who found the preceding argument completely convincing, it does seem to me that these various corre- 38 xcviii.ll, xcix.15, c.7; BE, pp. 243, 247, 250 (EV, pp. 205, 208, 209). See also ch. 94-103, passim (BE, pp. 235-57; EV, pp. 198-215). Wa big passages are of course found elsewhere in OE poetry; note especially Wife's Lament, 11. 52a-53, beginning "Wa bi5 Pam be sceal ...." 39 ciii.4-5,7-8; BE, pp. 256-57 (EV, pp. 214-15).

I am indebted to Malcolm Godden of Cambridge University for reminding me of the particularly close parallel between the Wel bi; passage in Beowulf, and Wanderer, 11. 114b-115: "Wel bib pam pe him are sece5, / frofre to fader on heofonum, peer us eal seo faestnung stondeb."</page><page sequence="11">Beowulf and the Book of Enoch 431 spondences and partial correspondences, taken all together, speak for the inter- esting possibility that the Book of Enoch may somehow have contributed to the cosmos assumed by the poet of Beowulf. If so, perhaps the most immediate effect would be to produce a clearer and more meaningful context for the figures of Grendel and his mother, whose whole portrayal seems indefinably to take for granted a greater degree of recognizeability than we have so far been able to find in them. And in a larger way, the world of Beowulf itself has long been a puzzle- not precisely Germanic, not precisely Old Testament, and not precisely Christian, though evidently embracing elements of all three. Is it not possible that the poet's very synthesis of these worlds and their differing outlooks is accom- plished in part through the catalyst of still another cosmic backdrop - that of the Old Testament apocrypha, represented particularly by the Book of Enoch?
