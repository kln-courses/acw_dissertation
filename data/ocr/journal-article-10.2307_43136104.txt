<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pottery Figurines of Chupicuaro, Mexico By Fredrick A. Peterson Under the auspices of a grant-in-aid from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Inc. A rich archaeological region is lo- cated along the banks of the Lerma River, between Acambaro, state of Guanajuato, and Lake Cuitzeo. Thou- sands of charming clay figurines and beautiful bowls have been found in this region, on the border between Guana- juato and Michoacan. They have been termed "Chupicuaro" after a small native settlement in the area. Chupi- cuaro materials are found at about 30 adjoining sites. The quality of artifacts and ceramics encountered demonstrates that this was once a great pottery- manufacturing center. (The author has seen more than 8,000 complete Chupicuaro bowls.) This material was taken by trade to nearby regions. The art style had a great influences on surrounding peoples, as Chupicuaro type figurines and pottery have been found in the states of Mexico, Morelos, Michoacan, Puebla, Queretaro, Hidalgo and Guanajuato. The anthropomorphic figurines are made with ancient techniques. Appli- que, incising and punctation were ap- plied to a pan-cake-like figure. This method of manufacture causes many authorities to hesitate and disagree about dating these figurines. Some state that the figurine technique is so primitive that an age of 1,500 B.C. must be assigned. Others say that the pottery-manufacturing technique is so perfect that they probably date around 1200 A.D. Both points of view are sup- ported by some excavation data, but pertinent excavations have been few and the material has not allowed sharp conclusions to be drawn. Some fragments of Chupicuaro ce- ramics have been found at Tlatilco, state of Mexico, which were mixed with remains of the Upper Pre-Classic period, dating around 200 B. C.1 George Vaillant, found figurines practically identical with Chupicuaro at Ticoman, state of Mexico, also dating from the Upper Pre-Classic period.2 A recent find, still unpublished, places this pottery together with early Maza- pan-Toltec materials, from around the year 900 A.D. Therefore the problem is again open, with dates varying from 200 B. C. to 900 A. D. The baked - clay anthropomorphic figures are made in two classes: (1), small and solid, as shown in (Figure 24) and class 2, large and hollow. They represent both male and female sexes, although some are neuter. They are related to some arcaic figures of Çolima and Michoacan and some have been found by George Vaillant at Ticoman and others by Byron Cummings at Cuicuilco. Their origin has deep arcaic roots, which directly feed the Chupi- cuaro figurines.3 They are found in burials, many of them relatively shallow, being around 70 centimeters from the surface to 1.30 meters. Determination of age has been attempted by comparison with other cultures and by direct excavation but results are still not satisfactory. They are made of baked clay in various shades of brown, generally on the light side. Yellow-brown and red- dish-brown are frequent. Their height varies from 4 to 10 centimeters. The features are formed with little strips or fillets of clay, incisions and punctations. On these figurines we find some of the finest and most elaborate applique in ancient Mexico. Native sophistication was attained with this technique. However modern artists 33</page><page sequence="2">would give a great deal to be able to display the fluidity and mastery shown by Chupicuaro potters. This crude technique lends itself well to experi- mentation. Rarely does one find two figurines that are alike. Even so, the "Chupicuaro" style is unmistakeable. Their rather sharp faces are charac- teristic and come from having a flat back-of-the-head, with pinched-up cheeks and a prominent nose. The figures have a rather flattened profile, oddly resembling Christmas-cookies, as shown in Figure 24. At times they are shown eating, drinking, carrying a baby, holding a dog, or carrying some object. Usually, however, they are portrayed as "just sort of standing- around." Most of them are in standing position, with some sitting Hindu- fashion and others lying on their stomachs. They wear very little clothing, usual- ly wearing only a smile. Sometimes they sport smart, little, round hats. The breasts, sexual organs and thighs of female figures are often exaggerated. This emphasis on female characteristics is found in many regions of the world in early periods, such as in the famed "Venus of Willendorpf." The thighs are either grossly exaggerated with dwindl- ing lower parts or gently tapering. The hair and headdress arrangement are the most variable features of the figurines. The hair is often shown parted, with elaborate side-locks and bangs. The hair-ties, bands, or rib- bons, are quite elaborate. The head- dresses at times incorporate birds and animals making them appear quite Victorian. The figures often have a little roll of fat on the stomach, showing that times could not have been too hard, as shown in (Figure 25). In some cases the stomach-roll of fat turns into a loin- cloth. A few figurines have a long cloth strip wound around the waist with long ends which serve as a loin- cloth. A few figurines were noted which had an object resembling a conch- shell placed over the genital area. The solid figurines are almost always smoothed. Color was applied by sprinkling red, yellow, or white miner- al paints into the cracks and grooves of the figurines. Besides this, color was also applied with brushes. White is shown in the eyes, neck ornaments and foot-grooves. Red is applied to the headdress, necklace, earplugs, armlets, belt and body. Most figurines wear armlets, and many have anklets. Almost all wear necklaces of 1 to 3 strands, usually end- ing in a distinct center-piece or pec- toral. Nose-plugs are not common, but ear-plugs are found on practically all, being of a round type. The arms are quite crude, being often grossly shortened. The hands are gen- erally little lumps, with hardly any wrist. Fingers are indicated by grooves. Arm and hand position varies slightly: on chest, stomach, to the sides, near or over genitals, etc. If sitting, the hands are on the knees or over the stomach. Sometimes more dynamic po- sitions are shown with hands to the mouth or arranging the hair. The feet are made in several ways: ovaloid or conical termination, or by pinching the end between 2 fingers and then pressing the thumb up from underneath to form a grooved platform, which allows the figurine to stand nice- ly. Some feet are very crude, often represented by a mere button of clay. The toes are poorly portrayed, being absent entirely or shown by two or three grooves hastily applied. It is evident that the potter was not in- terested in obtaining an exact fac- simile of life, but rather in developing some outstanding characteristic. The nose is large and quite promi- nent. It is made by placing a tiny strip of clay on the face and then pinching it into shape. The naval is generally indicated by small round hole in the appropriate place.

The eyebrows are shown as a distinctive feature on many figures. The mouth is made in several ways: a ball of clay with a groove in it, two slanting punctations, or two round holes connected by a slit. The back is usually plain, flat and somewhat concave. The buttocks are often delineated. Sometimes bands of applique extend over to the back from the front. The backs may have some painted decoration, but this is rare. Both large and small anthropomor- phic figurines are found in graves. Thereby we form the supposition that they served as companions to the dead, or performing some similar magical function. Probably they were effigies of the wife, husband or children of the deceased person. Some may have been made to provide servants or counsellors for the dead. Some may have acted as guides into the other world. In any event, they now furnish us with delight- ful examples of artistic expression of a long-vanished people. The former fruitful sites where these figurines were found are now covered by the waters of a large government dam. This action has ruined the site for further excavation. Perhaps near- by sites will be discovered. Until then determination of dates and other in- formation must depend on comparison with other cultures or by some fortunate excavation in surrounding territory. References 1.
