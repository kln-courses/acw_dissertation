<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARD THE NEW AESTHETIC Neal Oxenhandler "We can hardly put too much stress on the influence which at all times the past of art exerts on the future of art." -Ortega y Gasset. History has closed its parenthesis on the 1960s. Whatever historical calipers one uses, it is hard to separate French literature of the sixties from that of the fifties and late forties. The major writers who follow existentialism-Beckett, Genet, lonesco, Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simonl-share a common ground of specific aesthetic tendencies which set them off from the pre-existentialist tradition. Symbolism-entre-deux-guerres-existentialism-new aesthetic: this is the sequence I will be dealing with. It is an arbitrary, even partly imagined one. When the works are looked at chronologically, they slip around in a somewhat messy way; but this chronological messiness isn't really important. I am not trying to place individual works or define a "period" but rather to find the hidden pattern in the historical carpet, the "common ground of specific aesthetic ten- dencies," the aesthetic constants within that postwar literature which is, if we are men of the sixties, our own. The new aesthetic of the late forties, the fifties, and the sixties claims to be radical in a way that would have astounded the leaders of now archaic "new aesthetics," Du Bellay writing for the Pl6iade or 1Major works by Beckett and Genet were written prior to or during World War II. The point here is to define some kind of natural grouping or aesthetic movement rather than place individual works. CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE XI, 2</page><page sequence="2">Victor Hugo for the Romantics; it is radical. And it is also within the tradition. In regard to some issues, there is total rejection of the tra- ditional position. Here, the new aesthetic takes a polar opposite position to the traditional view. On genetic questions, having to do with the origins of literature, the new aesthetic is radical. On content questions, having to do with meaning and value in literature, it is even more radical. In the traditional or "old" aesthetic, art was the expression of personality; in the new, it is impersonal and objective. In the old, language was the means to self-expression; in the new, language is an end in itself. Rational composition ("metier") in the old gives way to composition via delirium or trance in the new. The traditional belief in art as value-giving for life is replaced by the end of belief in art and various kinds of trivialization of art. Content and signif- icant form in the old are deposed by contentless subject-matter and complex but nonsignifying form. Belief in art as transcendence (of time, space, individuation, death) is replaced by an insistence on objects, on things seen or perceived, things often repulsive, grotesque, or banal. Other concerns, equally important, remain constant from the old to the new aesthetic, where we find not polar opposites but rather mutations within the tradition. So for example the search for "open" forms begins with symbolism and progresses steadily, reaching its optimal use in a poet such as Apollinaire, who strikes a perfect balance between continuity, sequential connections, organic form, and the juxtaposition, disjunction, and improvisation that come to characterize much of the work in the new aesthetic. In this article I shall deal with three concerns which figure within the new aesthetic as mutations of positions elaborated within the tradition. These con- cerns are: (1) the ontological question (self and world); (2) liberty; (3) consciousness (its expansion and contraction). First, however, some underbrush needs to be cleared away. One of the difficulties encountered in defining the new aesthetic is that it seems inextricably tangled with existentialism and phe- nomenology. In an otherwise perceptive book on Robbe-Grillet,2 Olga Bernal begins by assimilating Robbe-Grillet's descriptive approach to objects to Husserlian reduction. She is led into this trap partly 2Alain Robbe-Grillet: le roman de F'absence (Paris, 1964). 170 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">by the semantic honey of Husserl's formula "back to the things them- selves" and partly by the hopeless confusion of Robbe-Grillet's own statements about fiction. While it is futile to try to match up Robbe- Grillet's attempts to deal with the inner/outer or subjective/objec- tive dichotomies with his own novelistic practice, surely Bruce Mor- rissette's sane attempt to explain Robbe-Grillet as a behaviorist critic and a subjective novelist is much closer to the facts. As for the iden- tification by Miss Bernal of Robbe-Grillet's "chosisme" with the Hus- serlian imperative ("back to the things themselves"), this cannot be, since what Husserl means is that objects can be apprehended only as correlates of intentional consciousness. While their existence does not depend on consciousness, their intelligibility and their philo- sophic givenness do. Husserl accords subjectivity a privileged exis- tence which he denies to the material realm: "Natural being is a realm whose existential status is secondary; it continually presup- poses the realm of transcendental being."3 Phenomenology goes in search of "things," but this search is conducted within the field of a systematically purified consciousness where things are made available as noematic essences, i.e., purified data for intentional con- sciousness. We get a clear sense of the disparity if we compare the following two quotations, the first by Robbe-Grillet, the second by Husserl: Around us, defying the swarm of our animistic or utilitarian adjectives, things are there. Their surface is clean and smooth, intact, with neither suspect radiance nor transparency. All our literature has failed to so much as drive a wedge into the smallest corner, alter the slightest curve.4 I, the transcendental phenomenologist, have objects (singly or in universal complexes) as a theme for my universal descriptions: solely as the inten- tional correlates of modes of consciousness of them. (p. 37) It is clear that objects are given in one way for the novelist and in another which is antithetical for the phenomenologist. As regards reduction, the basic procedure of the phenom- enologist as he gains purified or transcendental consciousness, here too we have an antithesis between Husserl and Robbe-Grillet. In 3All quotes from Husserl are from Dorion Cairns' translation of the Cartesian Meditations (The Hague, 1964). 4 Pour Un Nouveau Roman (Paris, 1963), p. 21. The essay was written in 1956. Translations throughout are mine unless otherwise indicated. NEW AESTHETIC [ 171</page><page sequence="4">the first stage of the reduction, the phenomenologist abstains "from every believing involved in or founded on sensuous experiencing" (p. 20). Now there is a sense in which the narrator of La Jalousie, to take an obvious example, abstains from belief in his "sensuous experiencing," since he continually renews his observations from ever-changing vantage points without coming to any explicit con- clusion about his wife's infidelity. But this differs from the phe- nomenologist's procedure in a number of vital respects. First, he never attempts to go beyond his "sensuous experiencing"; second, his abstention from "believing in" may only be apparent, since he does not, as the phenomenologist does, make this abstention explicit and thematic; third, his observations are circular, not leading to tran- scendental awareness but rather tending to fragment the awareness that it offers to sceptical scrutiny. It is possible, I suppose, to describe Robbe-Grillet's method as a kind of "bracketing" or "suspension" of some elements of consciousness, since it is obvious that many things are left unsaid. Unfortunately, many of these unsaid things are precisely those that would be of interest to a phenomenologist. The subsequent stages of reduction, the eidetic and the transcendental, are wholly removed from any practice or concern of Robbe-Grillet's. Their goal is the attainment of purified "essences," a term for which the novelist has proclaimed his abhorrence. In general, it would be appropriate to say that, rather than illustrating any form of phe- nomenological approach, Robbe-Grillet illustrates that aspect of the "natural attitude" known as "horizonal knowing." He presents as- pects, profiles, adumbrations of objects which are always limited by a specific horizon; he is implicitly phenomenological to the degree that he makes us aware of the horizonal aspect of knowledge. We cannot then call Robbe-Grillet, or any other contemporary writer, "phenomenological" in an unexamined way; the connection of the new aesthetic with these philosophies is, and Miss Bernal has sensed this, real; but it is neither simple nor obvious, rather tangential and accidental than systematic and immediate. I especially object to the placement of phenomenology and existentialism in the immediate background, as the "ancestor" of the new aesthetic, rather than specific literary movements such as those I shall soon be dealing with. What we need is some kind of map, a map of what Samuel Beckett might call "the Sartre and Merleau-Ponty country," on which we can see where the frontiers of the movements join and where they are separated by seas and chasms. Since Sartre emerged as the leading literary figure of postwar France, it was in- 172 [ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">evitable that he play the role of historical catalyst. It was in fact his polemic that rang down the curtain on the old aesthetic right after World War II. Through the readily assimilable existential themes of his philosophy, as well as his specific involvement in the arts, Sartre in his own time played a more stellar role than Merleau- Ponty. Still, with the passage of time it has become clear that Mer- leau-Ponty's contribution to the study of aesthetic problems may eclipse that of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's principal theme was the pre-reflexive or pre- conscious life of the self expressed bodily in an environing world. His philosophy is thus relevant to that modern literature (Joyce, Proist, Faulkner, Claude Simon, Nathalie Sarraute) concerned with the preconscious life. In contrast to Sartre, with his emphasis on external or political "situation," Merleau-Ponty emphasized the degree to which the subjective life is the locus of our relations with others. "For value resides here. It consists in being actively what we are by chance, in establishing that communication with others and with ourselves for which our temporal structure offers us the opportunity and of which our freedom is only the rough draft."6 In his emphasis on bodily expression as fundamental to literature as to all human experience, Merleau-Ponty elaborated views expressed earlier by Gas- ton Bachelard; in his vision of language as incarnated consciousness, he anticipated the direction of much contemporary criticism. Merleau-Ponty's debate with Sartre turned on his conviction that Sartre had become a "mandarin" who mistook his ability to formu- late political issues for a form of political action: The action of revealing has its facilities and its torments which are those of contemplation. They are problems and solutions of mandarins. The myth of the mandarin reunites the fantasy of a total knowledge and pure action. By virtue of his knowledge, the mandarin is supposedly present everywhere a problem presents itself, and capable of acting immediately, no matter where, without distance and by pure efficacy, as if what he did fell into an inert milieu and as if it were not, at the same time, only theater, manifestation, object of scandal or enthusiasm. The spectator-conscious- ness is too occupied with seeing to be able to see itself as a "special" consciousness, and it dreams of an action which would be another sort of ubiquity. Such is the naivet6 and the ruse of narcissism.6 5 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Sens et non-sens (Paris, 1948), p. 80; from an essay on Simone de Beauvoir. 6 Translation by Eugene F. Kaelin, An Existentialist Aesthetic (Madison, NEW AESTHETIC 1 173</page><page sequence="6">Sartre's importance for the new aesthetic is multifarious; but four topics deserve special emphasis: (1) Sartre attacked the liberal humanism which had been the basic moral stance of the French writer since Montaigne. While few followed Sartre through Marx- ism's pearly gates, the route was left open for Genet's morality of inversion, the ethical minimalism of Ionesco and Beckett, Robbe- Grillet's "homme nouveau," etc. (2) Following Brecht, Sartre pro- posed an aesthetic of distancing or alienation rather than one of identification as the desirable mode of spectator or reader response. Once again, as in his annihilation of humanism, Sartre's negative polemic finished off its victim. Traditional forms of reader or spec- tator response (empathy, catharsis, poetic "pleasure," identification) were abandoned by the new writers. But Sartre's call for co-creation by the reader as he encounters the work, his plea for respect for the reader's freedom and a new kind of camaraderie between author and reader-these generous views seemed largely irrelevant to the literature of the fifties and sixties. It is Artaud's aesthetic of cruelty that has prevailed. The writer, especially in the theater, confronts, assaults, and if possible terrorizes his spectator or reader. With fiendish cunning, writers such as Genet, Ionesco, and Arrabal turn up one by one the stones beneath which the reader has sought refuge; he is attacked in his prejudices, his beliefs, his most private emotions. Sartre's polemic may have contributed to founding the literature of cruelty to the degree that it questioned traditional kinds of human relationships as suggested in the next point. (3) Sartre attacked all forms of transcendence, negating any viable interaction between the self and the other. A bleak solipsism prevails in his creative works, while the kinds of human interactions that he has drawn in his philosophical works grant only minimal rewards; here there are links between Sartrism and the ethical min- imalism of writers like Beckett and Ionesco. Robbe-Grillet (whose door into fiction was Sartre's La Nausee, so clearly the predecessor of Les Gommes) criticizes Sartre's metaphorical complicity with objects, one that allows Sartre certain limited transactions with the material world. If objects do not look at him with "des regards familiers," they nonetheless reveal their own ontological gratuity, thereby suggesting to him his own. (4) As stated above, the onto- Wis., 1966), p. 144. The excerpt is from Merleau-Ponty's Les Aventures de la dialectique, pp. 238-239, 144. 174 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">logical question was formulated in a solipsistic way that allowed only for perverse kinds of human relationships (e.g., sadism); Sartre's careful analyses in Being and Nothingness of different types of onto- logical pairings represent his most original contribution both to philosophy and literature. His solipsistic "romanticism" (to bor- row a label from Iris Murdoch) provided theoretical undergirdings not only for the new aesthetic but for works of preceding generations such as the novels of Kafka, Celine, and Proust, the critical specula- tions of Valery, the poetry of Ponge and Michaux. Because of the concision of his formulations and the power of his polemic, most critics who are writing about the new aesthetic begin with a ritualistic genuflection in Sartre's direction. But in fact Sartre as novelist or playwright has no aesthetic of his own. His works are all improvised on illustrious models. La Nausee is a tele- scoped A La Recherche du temps perdu, recast as a Voltairean conte philosophique; his debt to Aeschylus in Les Mouches is ob- vious; techniques borrowed from Dos Passos inform L'Age de raison, and so on. Both in literature and in philosophy Sartre is an eclectic. This is not a bad thing to be, but should commend caution in the issuing of revolutionary manifestos or calls for destruction of the old order. In order to deal adequately with the new aesthetic, we must look not at "the existentialist aesthetic" which (in spite of Eugene Kaelin's excellent book) has not produced any significant body of literary work, but rather at the aesthetics of the two preceding literary generations-the symbolists and the writers of the entre-deux-guerres period. Here we find writers dealing with the same kinds of concerns as those that motivate Beckett and Robbe-Grillet and Claude Simon. They may be on opposite sides of the questions, yet the questions are raised in the same way, in the same language. As radical as the writers of the fifties and sixties may have considered themselves to be, they were within-not outside of-literature, and it is within litera- ture that we must frame them in order to see them. In its simplest version the symbolist aesthetic proposes a con- tinuum between man and nature, that chain of "correspondences" elicited by Baudelaire in his poem of that title: La Nature est un temple ou de vivants piliers Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles; NEW AESTHETIC 175</page><page sequence="8">L'homme y passe A travers des forets de symboles Qui l'observant avec des regards familiers.7 The continuum is described in other terms in Baudelaire's essay on Victor Hugo: ... everything, form, movement, number, color, perfume, in the spiritual domain as well as the material, is signifying, reciprocal, converse, corre- sponding.... everything is a hieroglyph, and we know that symbols are only relatively obscure, that is to say according to the purity, the good- will or native clairvoyance of individual souls. Hence, what is a poet (I take the term in its largest acceptation) if not a translator, a cryptographer?8 If we move in for a closer look at man's link with nature (leaving aside other symbolist themes such as indirect discourse, music, revery, drugs, decadence), we find throughout symbolist writing the assump- tion that man's link with nature is-though real-cloudy and ten- uous. The purity of soul required by Baudelaire does not appease the haunted Mallarme who, in his early poem "L'Azur," sees the material world as a refuge from the mockery of the ideal or absolute, repre- sented by the blue sky: "-Le Ciel est mort.-Vers toi, j'accoursl donne, 6 matiere, / L'oubli de l'Ideal cruel et du Peche .. .. " But in the later "Toast Funebre" the material world becomes as mysterious and obscure as the sky: Le n4ant a cet Homme aboli de jadis: "Souvenirs d'horizon, qu'est-ce, 6 toi, que la Terre?" Hurle ce songe; et, voix dont la clarte s'altere, L'espace a pour jouet le cri: "Je ne sais pas!"10 It would take many quotations and an intricate gloss to do justice to Mallarme's vision alongside of which Beaudelaire's seems simplistic 7 "Nature is a temple where living pillars/ Sometimes release a murmuring of words;/ Man wanders through these forests of symbols/ Which look at him with familiar glances." "Correspondances," Oeuvres compltes de Baudelaire (Paris, 1961), p. 11. 8 "Victor Hugo," ibid., p. 705. 9 "The Sky is dead. Toward you, I rush! give, o matter,/ Forgetfulness of the cruel Ideal and of Sin . . ." Oeuvres completes (Paris, 1945), p. 37. 10 "Nothingness to this man who has ceased:/ 'Memories of horizons, what, I ask you, is the Earth?'/ Yells this dream, and voice whose clarity fades,/ Space gets for plaything the cry: 'I know not!'" Ibid., p. 55. 176 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">indeed: for Baudelaire the world is the "universal analogy" to be deciphered by acts of poetic insight or correspondences, brief epipha- nies in which the unity of disparate objects and perceptions is given in metaphoric fusion. Such epiphanies produce the exstasis, "les transports de l'esprit et des sens" which are the poet's reward. For MallarmE on the other hand the world is seen in an Hege- lian perspective. He identifies Absolute Spirit with lucidity and creative thought; at the apex of history stands not the philosopher but the poet who reflects and illuminates the consciousness of his ra- cial and cultural past. Mallarme's poetry moves dialectically, through affirmation and negation, to the expression of pure idea, pure con- sciousness; this consciousness is attained now as source ("jaillis- sement"), now as pure essence ("l'idee"), now as the reflexivity through which knowledge of the self is founded ("le regard"), now as nothingness ("le neant"), now as the ground or field of perceptual experience ("il faut penser de tout son corps"), now as dream ("Maint reve vesperal"). Factual experience is thus presented in a direct and immediate relationship to pure consciousness (for Mal- larme is, in many respects, close to his near-contemporary, Husserl). Using Husserlian language, we might say that for Mallarme objects and events in consciousness are "irrealities," that is, "pure fictive possibilities," exemplars or prototypes of actual events. The poet's task is the clarification of these "irrealities" within a purified con- sciousness. Following the development of symbolism from Baudelaire through its ultimate expression in Mallarme, we find a growing aware- ness of the ambiguities of the poet's task. In language, itself a mysterious phenomenon whose various functions can never be fully explained (though Valery will take up this endeavor as his principal task), the object is both given and negated or annihilated; the poem, which arises in the space left by the vibrating aura of the voided object, does not give the poetic exstasis of Baudelaire but rather momentarily relieves the poet of the object's hauntings. Ridden by the ghosts of objects and events, he now momentarily enjoys the freedom of purified consciousness: "To what end the marvel of transposing a fact in nature into its almost vibratory disappearance according to the play of language, however; if it is not to permit, without the hindrance of a near or concrete echo, the emanation of the pure notion."11 1 Ibid., p. 368. NEW AESTHETIC | 177</page><page sequence="10">Andre Gide, who in his youth attended the Mardis of Mallarme, links symbolism and the entre-deux-guerres. In the first text Gide published under his own signature he wrote: Truths lie behind the Forms-the Symbols. Each phenomenon is the Symbol of a Truth. Its only duty is to manifest (that Truth). Its only sin: to prefer itself (to that Truth). We live to manifest. The rules of aesthetics and of morality are the same: any work which does not manifest is useless and by that fact wicked. Any man who does not manifest is useless and wicked.... The moral question for the artist is not whether the Idea that he manifests is more or less moral and useful to the greatest number; the question is whether or not he has manifested it well....12 This is a primitive form of symbolism reminiscent more of Baudelaire than Mallarme. Elsewhere in the Traite Gide sketches an aesthetic of appearances, summoning us to look beneath the surface of things to catch their momentary archetypal perfection before it is destroyed by time and change. As a doctrinaire symbolist he describes the poet as the seer or visionary who pierces the world's outer multiplicity to find its hidden order. Not to lose sight of our objective, the point at issue here is the kind of relationship between self and world that is prescribed within the three successive aesthetics. Mallarme's position within symbolism is an extreme or boundary case. As for Gide, he begins with a con- ventional Baudelairean view of the poet as cryptographer; a few years later this is modified when he describes the poet as the harmonizer of warring psychic and natural forces; already, the imposition of order appears more difficult than he had first suspected. ".... . the work of art requires an ordering, but an ordering of what if not these tumultuous forces themselves?"13 In general, throughout the entre- deux-guerres period (foreshadowed by these early statements of Gide's), writers search for equilibrium among the various forces at play within the work. Jacques Riviere's call for "a deep inner Clas- sicism" in the June 1919 issue of the Nouvelle Revue frangaise, the first number published after the war, accurately characterizes this impulse. The history of literature from symbolism to the new aesthetic 12Le TraitW de Narcisse (Thoorie du symbole) in Oeuvres compltes d'Andre Gide (Paris, 1932), pp. 215-216; first published in 1891. 13Nouveaux PrItextes (Paris, 1928), p. 92; written in 1905. 178 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">shows a fluctuating view of the relative importance of consciousness vis-a-vis the world and the sensory awareness within which the world is given to consciousness. Both the magical idealism of Baudelaire and the transcendentalism of Mallarm6 represent temporary high-water marks; most writers assume a more moderate position. Pierre Rev- erdy, writing in the thirties, provides an example of the effort to maintain "balance," as is shown in the following parallel texts: The poet's role is justified ... only by his work. And the work of art itself has no better nor no more human justification than to be, in the highest degree, the particular and necessary realization of a personality. For the primordial goal of a work is to prove in the first instance to its creator that it was indeed for him the true, the only means of leading his existence to the summum of power and perfection in the concrete. In the last twenty-five years, all efforts in art have sought to establish a hierarchy of values, thereby dominating the mind, and with mind thus reestablished in its proper place, the glorification and the return to honor of matter.14 While the first quotation emphasizes "personality" (self or con- sciousness), the second expresses what Merleau-Ponty has called "le prejuge du monde" in its expression of the "glorification . .. of matter." The entre-deux-guerres view of the desirability of "balance" has certain features of what is called in psychology the "constancy hypothesis." The constancy theory finds a necessary parity between the stimuli of sensory data and the psychological responses to that data which are viewed as real mundane events. The neglect of stimulus/response balance in art due to deformation or (in Ortega y Gasset's term) "dehumanization" leads for Reverdy and other typical aestheticians to an undesirable abstractness and arbitrariness in art. Robert Greene writes of Reverdy: ". . . both he and Ortega are concerned with the same process, the decline of the representa- tion of objective reality in artistic creation and the emergence of the intellectual abstraction of objective reality for creative purposes."15 Yet somewhat inconsistently Reverdy insists on the "autonomy" of the work of art, hence its freedom from the arbitrary and com- 14 Both quotations are from Robert W. Greene's The Poetic Theory of Pierre Reverdy (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1967), pp. 70-71. The second excerpt was written in 1933. 15 Ibid., p. 26. NEW AESTHETIC [ 179</page><page sequence="12">monsense reportage of sensory data. We have only to think of the paintings of Picasso, the "cubist" poetry of Apollinaire, the auto- matic writing of the surrealists to realize how consistently the entre- deux-guerres ignored constancy or balance in order to fashion the work as an autonomous entity. While balance was often neglected or even flaunted in the entre-deux-guerres, we must admit that it was a persistent feature of the period's aesthetic thought; as a funda- mental aesthetic theme, it was implicitly present even when absent: in the psychic background of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon the per- ceptive viewer can almost make out the naturalistic scene that Picasso chose not to paint; in Claudel's Soulier de Satin or his Cristophe Colombe the perceptive reader finds the unwritten historical matrix from which the plays emerged. For the symbolists the object bathes in radiance; its status as perceptual relay of transcendent (from the divine or from other minds) or transcendental (given a priori by my own mind) truth enhances it with a magical fluorescence. Even when a transcen- dentalizing poet such as Mallarme voids the object and causes it to vanish into its absence, it leaves a glowing nimbus or aura behind. In the entre-deux-guerres, in spite of deformation and dehuman- ization, respect for the object continues. Specific tendencies such as humanism, philosophical realism, and Christian optimism instruct the writer to celebrate and praise the material world. For Proust the world is the unique key to the happiness of memory. Claudel re- veres the world because it is God's creation. Giraudoux delights in the world simply for itself. While there are exceptions, such as Celine (by that token a forerunner of the new aesthetic), the entre- deux-guerres attitude to the world is by and large emphatically posi- tive. What someone has called "the fumble of alienation" dominates the solipsistic ontologies of the new aesthetic. The views of mundane experience found in the new aesthetic writers are by and large domi- nated by some kind of scepticism about the ability of consciousness to appropriate the world of objects. The novels of Robbe-Grillet have made a brilliant and original use of horizonal vision and demonstrated great skill in handling narrational techniques. His selective use of description, his in- genuity in the repetitive presentation of objects, his ability to frame and simplify events-all this has made his novels highly effec- tive. I believe that it is the novels of Robbe-Grillet that we must look 180 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="13">at if we are to talk about the ontological status of objects within his work. (In his essays Robbe-Grillet has tried, illegitimately in my opinion, to transmute the novelistic device of horizonal vision into an ontological postulate, as in the statement: "So the world is neither meaningful nor absurd. It quite simply is."16 The statement is both trivial and naive; certainly it offers no basis for a new epistemology of the object.) In the novels the use of horizonal vision, with its carefully controlled profiles within perceptual experience, gives us an unusual and effective (if somewhat schizophrenic) view of the world. Sedimented within the perceptual adumbrations, finally, there is a sense of the world as distant, aloof, threatening. The growing mania of the typical robbe-grilletien characters seizes the reader's imagination with something of the horror of Dostoevsky or Kafka. To the degree that through the adumbration of objects Robbe-Grillet awakes the reader's emotional response ("the reader, for the duration of the story, becomes himself Mathias," says Bruce Morrissette of the hero of Le Voyeur), he is within the tradition of the novel. Sartre and Nathalie Sarraute, on the other hand, enter into a more immediate and spontaneous rapport with the material world than does Robbe-Grillet. The principal issue for Sartre in La Naus6e and for Sarraute is the assessment of the degree of reflection or con- sciousness inherent in our perception of things; or better, the use made by consciousness of things. Robbe-Grillet, especially in passages where he makes use of arithmetical or geometrical configurations to describe objects, tries to present the object within consciousness as if it were really outside of consciousness. Sartre and Nathalie Sar- raute, on the other hand, detect a necessary complicity between con- sciousness and the object. The object is not so much scrutinized by consciousness as absorbed by it. In La Nausee objects are always pre- sented in human metaphors; so the object acquires the viscosity or protoplasmic fluidity typical of consciousness. Robbe-Grillet attempts to describe the object in itself without appropriating it; seen merely as a construction of space-occupying surfaces, the object loses most of its mystery. For Sartre and Sarraute, it takes on the additional mystery of consciousness itself. Consciousness draws the object forth from its obscurity; when it has served to interpret consciousness to itself, it falls back into its obscurity once again. In the novels of Claude Simon, the world is apprehended with- out mediation of arbitrary categories. There is horizonal vision; there 16 Pour Un Nouveau Roman, p. 21. NEW AESTHETIC | 181</page><page sequence="14">is raw sensory data; but most consistently, there is perception deeply imbued with reflection. In interlocking narrative modes of great com- plexity, there is presentation and re-presentation of scenes and ob- jects. Simon's boutade, "If the world means anything, it means that it has no meaning,""7 is contradicted by his novelistic practice, which is precisely the imposition not of "a" meaning but of meanings as multiple as there are observing minds. These patient (but not ob- sessed) viewers, these systematic (but not doctrinaire) narrators unravel their perceptual experiences within a fundamentally tradi- tional novelistic frame where the pressure of dramatized events ac- counts for their unusual attentiveness and acuity of vision. They do not merely know that the world is; little by little they (and we) come to know what it is. Arbitrary purifications or deletions, so com- mon in the nouveau roman, are discredited in favor of a world-af- firming consciousness. Claude Simon exposes the arbitrariness of other world-views simply by telling us what he sees, what he finds of the world within consciousness; the finding legitimizes it as the subject of fiction. In Claude Simon's novels the world is given with a certain density, a profusion not only of linguistic forms and of perceptions but-through the linguistic matrix-a density of created reality itself. When we enter the world of Samuel Beckett, however, we discover an entropic cosmos, one that is seemingly in the process of running down, diminishing, signing off. Here is no world-affirmation. Sym- bolist magic idealism, entre-deux-guerres constancy, Sartrean met- aphoric appropriation are all absent from Beckett's literary cosmos, in which objects are treated with the total irreverence we reserve for common household items. If we move from the level of objects to a broader level, where Beckett expresses his views on material reality in general, we can find numerous formulations of which the following are mere samples. In the first, Molloy (who is a compulsive or "compelled" speaker like all of Beckett's heroes) bemoans the difficulty of enumerating all the details of the factual world: For if you set out to mention everything you would never be done, and that's what counts, to be done, to have done. Oh I know, even when you mention only a few of the things there are, you do not get done either, I know, I know. But it's a change of muck. And if all muck is the same 17 Quoted by Madeleine Chapsal in L'Express, January 12, 1961. 182 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="15">muck that doesn't matter, it's good to have a change of muck, to move from one heap to another a little further on .... 8 The Unnamable, hero of the third volume of the trilogy, gives us Beckett's ultimate view of the cosmos: ". . . it's like shit, there we have it at last, there it is at last, the right word, one has only to seek, seek in vain, to be sure of finding in the end, it's a question of elimination."19 The puns on "end" and on the implied phrase "a process of elimination" add a comic echo to the point of the sen- tence. The act of describing objects is equivalent in Beckett's "excre- mental vision" to the act of defecating into holes that dot the tortured Dantesque landscape where the narrator finds himself. Even Beckett cannot entirely deny or void or annihilate the world; but he can and does express his emphatic revulsion toward it. Concluding with Beckett, in many ways the writer most distant from traditional views of the world, we seem to have moved far from the world-affirming optimism that is by and large typical of the tradi- tion. This is true enough. Yet even though the world diminishes, almost to the point of vanishing completely, in Beckett's novelistic cosmos, there is-as we pointed out earlier in regard to Robbe-Grillet -an empathetic response elicited from the reader. Not only does this produce a charged emotional "field" around the work, it tends to the enhancement of those pots, pencils, knife-rests, hats, pebbles, and so forth, that are the material residuum in Beckett's world. So that the reader is as emotionally concerned for Molloy's sucking- stones as he might be, in another context, for objects raised by more traditional authors to a level of emotional significance-Charles Bovary's hat, Edouard's counterfeit coins, etc. Here the role of the emotional response (still viable in spite of new aesthetic distancing theories) functions as a kind of glue or solvent that fuses an aberrant and radical novelistic world back into unity with the tradition. Liberty has been a rallying cry for French writers since the eighteenth century. It was both a political and aesthetic issue for the Romantics; primarily aesthetic for the symbolists; it was dual once again for the entre-deux-guerres. In the NRF article quoted earlier, 18 Samuel Beckett, Molloy (New York, 1955), p. 55; originally published in French in 1950. 19The Unnamable (New York, 1958), p. 109; originally published in French in 1952. NEW AESTHETIC | 183</page><page sequence="16">Jacques Riviere wrote: "Therefore, today as yesterday in spite of any possible scruples, it is still necessary to purify the aesthetic atmo- sphere and to keep it clear of all irrelevant influences. ... To com- plete our triumph, we must show that we can once more listen to ourselves rather than all that outside noise whose rhythm still seeks to regulate the rhythm of our thoughts."20 A statement by Robbe- Grillet which I find unusually eloquent states the position of the contemporary writer: ? . . the artist puts nothing above his work, and he soon perceives that he can only create for nothing; the slightest external directive paralyzes him, the least concern to be didactic or even meaningful is an unbearable constraint upon him; whatever his attachment to a party or to altruistic ideas may be, the moment of creation leads him to the problems of his art exclusively.21 Here Robbe-Grillet demands purity in the practice of his art as the symbolists and NRF writers had demanded it before him. There is an impressive continuity on this issue in the French writer's view of his vocation. Faced against this monolithic demand, Sartre's plea for an engaged literature appears as a mere episode of no greater consequence than the theatre d'idees of Dumas fils and Frangois de Curel. Freedom from technical or aesthetic constraints has been a constant feature of modern critical polemics. The symbolists were innovators and inventors. In the entre-deux-guerres, innovation is the sine qua non of artistic merit. Most entre-deux-guerres writers op- erated on the assumption that a potent emotion or experience would create its own unique form. As Max Jacob put it, "The essence of the matter is to model your idea with words, your emotion with a syntax. Place yourself in front of the object and wait for the epithet that describes it to come to you."22 If you have strong enough feelings or if you merely confront the object you wish to write about, the appropriate words and form will (by some unexplained psychological law) come to you automatically. The miracle was that it seemed to work! Occasionally, though, critics such as Thibaudet did counsel more circumspection in regard to the past; after all, the greatest works 20 Edited and translated by Justin O'Brien, From the NRF (New York, 1959), pp. 5, 7. 21 Pour Un Nouveau Roman, p. 42. 22 Conseils a un jeune poete (Paris, 1945), p. 45. 184 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="17">of French literature had been written in conventional forms which were subtly reinvented or recreated from within. The move toward formal innovation is fascinating to follow in the entre-deux-guerres period, where Max Jacob's formula is generally observed. The elaborate rhetoric of Giraudoux is the ballet of a tender yet cynical morality; Claudel's Biblical prose matches his cosmic vision; Malraux' fragmented, elliptic, cinematic narratives frame a splintering world in which the stoic hero cannot hold his own. Among the great writers of the fifties and sixties, only a few are totally successful in the creation of new and powerful forms: Beckett and Genet tower above the others. Although directly inspired by Faulkner, Claude Simon has produced a novelistic work of consider- able freshness. While Robbe-Grillet and Nathalie Sarraute may be more original than Simon, their oeuvres lack his scope and magni- tude. Formal innovations developed within the new aesthetic show the progressive abandonment of controlled, organic form, form showing logical, causal, or sequential connections, in favor of open forms, forms making use of disjunction, juxtaposition, relations of antithesis rather than of similarity. There is considerably more freedom in the use of irrational, absurd, or incoherent elements; and, especially in film and the plastic arts of the late sixties, the outright acceptance of the "random" as a formal principle. These forms show to a heightened degree the "dehumanization of art" described by Ortega in his 1948 essay; such art is meant not to enhance life but to serve as its alternative, while at the same time it is ironical and self-contesting. These tendencies were fortified by the call issued by Sartre and Robbe-Grillet for an end to humanism and certain archaic myths, chief among them the myth of human interiority or "profondeur." (Whether or not these "reforms" have actually been carried out is another matter.) Guillaume Apollinaire's 1918 manifesto, "L'Esprit nouveau et les poetes," predicted an expansive future for new generations of poets that would include varied techniques, drawing on all the arts of communication, and a broadly inclusive subject-matter from which no aspect of life would be rejected. In the pre-McLuhanism of the esprit nouveau a vast broadening of the poetic concept would make poetry more adequate to contemporary life. This program was mod- estly realized in Apollinaire's own work; without any direct influence, Apollinaire's program has been wholly realized in contemporary NEW AESTHETIC | 185</page><page sequence="18">theater. In the novel, however, Apollinaire's mingling of forms and subject-matters has not become the dominant type of mental expan- sion. The idea of an expanded consciousness has been a central motif from symbolism to the present era, where it is inverted in the work of Beckett. I have mentioned the purified consciousness which was the goal of Mallarmean poetics. Mallarme, who reached the pinnacle of symbolist poetics, had and could have had no imitator. In the entre-deux-guerres aesthetic, Reverdy's attempt to expand mind, without abandoning the material element within perception, is typical: The poet's proper activity is to think and to think in images-to consider objects in the degree to which they can form the images which constitute his particular mode of expression. His supreme power is to discern, within objects, those connections ("rapports") which are real but not obvious which, through a violent juxtaposition, will produce an unforeseen har- mony, an emotion which the spectacle of the objects themselves would be unable to give us. And it is by this revelation of a secret link among objects, of which until then we had only imperfect knowledge, that a specifically poetic emotion is obtained.23 When he speaks of a "revelation" within any perception that links disparate objects, Reverdy gives us in effect an aesthetic of the image. The poetic image is that mental event which provides, through a juxtaposition, new knowledge. At the same time it triggers the poetic emotion. This emotion has two components. First, by the mediation of the image, the distance between mind and world is abruptly foreshortened, producing the shock of perceptual displace- ment. Second, the mind expands within the image which now be- comes a microcosmic world. The first element is the "surprise" called for by Apollinaire in his manifesto; the second is Baudelairean exstasis ("les transports de l'esprit et des sens"). Both components combine in the poetic emotion. With the exception of Robbe-Grillet (who is not above sur- reptitious use of imagery), the aesthetic of the image figures centrally in the new aesthetic. Here I will remark on only one aspect of imagery, the dedoublement or doubling back of consciousness within the image. An early example occurs in Sartre's La Nausee when 23 Greene, The Poetic Theory of Pierre Reverdy, p. 81. 186 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="19">Roquentin says, "I was the root of the chestnut tree."24 On one level the image expresses the philosophical proposition that through complicity with objects Roquentin learns to recognize the gratuity of his existence. Roquentin is not incorporated in the tree root as a material entity but rather in the root as image or perceptual matrix. Sartre explains this doubling of consciousness in an essay on Francis Ponge: Ponge considers speech to be a veritable shell which envelops us and protects our nudity, a shell that we have secreted to match the softness of our bodies. The texture of words is for him a real, a perceived existence: he sees words around him, around us. Yet this rigorously objectivist, even materialistic concept is at the same time an unreserved commit- ment to language. ... In short, it is less a question of observing the pebble than of installing oneself within it and seeing the world with its eyes....25 Embodied consciousness cannot see or know by intuitive acts de- tached from objects; the perceived object (the image) mediates all awareness, even that reflexive awareness that the mind has of itself. No art form is as dependent on the image as film; the following statement by Jean-Luc Godard is squarely in the Sartrean mold: "What I wanted, Godard revealed, in talking about Made in USA and his short film Anticipation, was to get inside the images . . . just the way certain paintings give one the feeling of being within them, inside them, or give the impression that they can never be understood as long as the viewer remains outside."26 This is not a revival of anthropomorphism. It represents one of those crossroads where phenomenology has intersected the arts. The philosophical basis for these statements is Husserl's theory of intentionality: consciousness is always directed, it is always consciousness of some-thing. To say, as Sartre does, that Ponge gets "inside" objects, or, as Godard does, that he gets "inside" the image means that he strives to live within his perceptions since this is after all where objects appear. Rejecting the alienating world of naive realism and common sense, he does not look outward at an alien world but rather inward, trying to live within the immediacy of perceptual images. As an artist Godard is in- 24La Naus6e (Paris, 1938), p. 86. 25 "L'Homme et les choses," Situations I (Paris, 1947), pp. 247-248, 263. 26 Quoted by J. R. MacBean, "Politics, Painting and the Language of Signs" in Godard's Made in USA, Film Quarterly, XXII, 3 (Spring 1969), 18. NEW AESTHETIC | 187</page><page sequence="20">different to Husserl's (or anybody else's) need to transcend per- ception; he may not care and he surely does not seek a life beyond perception. The whole thematic import of his films denies such a concern. Like other new aesthetic artists, Godard has only one goal: the revelation of man, or rather the individual man, that each one is. My topic up to this point has been the expansion of conscious- ness; but a major current of the new aesthetic (Beckett and the early Ionesco are its chief representatives) moves in an opposite di- rection-toward the contraction of consciousness. Writers such as Sartre, Camus, and Robbe-Grillet set specific limits to consciousness: Camus, for example, refused any rational meaning-giving view of man; Sartre attacked transcendence; Robbe-Grillet limited man's con- tact with objects to descriptive annotations. Still, each one was a humanist in spite of himself, and optimistic tendencies, together with programs for expanded consciousness, occur in their works. Ionesco and Beckett, with programmatic consistency, take as their charge the diminution of consciousness. They reduce it to minimal limits, as apparent, for example, in the automatisms of Ionesco's early plays. This approach is tied to an ethical minimalism whose human implications are even more devastating than the attacks of other anti-humanists, for example, the inverted morality of Genet or the infantile provocations of Arrabal. Progressing through Beck- ett's fictions we find a gradual closing-out of fundamental human concerns; at the end the sole surviving vital imperative is the re- luctant need to go on talking. We owe to Hugh Kenner our insight into Beckett's Carte- sianism. He has pointed out that the protagonist of The Unnamable performs one half of the cogito. He "knows that he thinks but would like to feel certain that he exists." Kenner has also called attention to that "Cartesian centaur," Molloy on his bicycle, who mimics Cartesian mind using a body. Like Descartes, Beckett "makes the whole of intelligible reality depend on the mental processes of a solitary man....'27 As we progress through the trilogy from Molloy, who moves through physical space, to Malone, who lies practically immobilized in bed, to the Unnamable, who has no body at all, we find a progressive detachment of mind from body. The embodied consciousness of Sartre and Godard is replaced by a deteriorated mind whose only link with the material world is a random collection of imprecise and fading memories. 27 Hugh Kenner, Samuel Beckett (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1968), p. 17. 188 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="21">Beckettian consciousness is fully detached only in The Unnam- able; in the two preceding volumes it is located in the protagonist's head: And softly my little space begins to throb again. You may say it is all in my head, and indeed sometimes it seems to me that I am in a head and that these eight, no, six, these six planes that enclose me are of solid bone. But thence to conclude that the head is mine, no, never.28 The quotation indicates that the localization of consciousness in the head is of no particular importance; Malone refuses to claim the head as his own. More important is the content of that consciousness. Within each volume, this content can be described as a periodic fluctuation between lucidity and incoherence. When we take the trilogy as a whole, however, we find not fluc- tuation but a descending curve that moves steadily from comparative lucidity to formal anarchy and verbal incoherence. The contraction of consciousness to a minimal state is one of Beckett's major themes. In spite of certain survival features, it succumbs to hostile devices that are multiplied with great virtuosity. There is, for example, a parodying of mental processes such as logic, memory, classification of data, narration, and description. These processes appear in an aberrant way, suggesting mental derangement. A permanent feature of Beckett's style is the self-contradictory phrases which, by flaunting the principle of contradiction, undermine the validity of thought. For example: "The dog was uniformly yellow, a mongrel I suppose, or a pedigree." "Deep in the intermediate past." "My life, my life, now I speak of it as of something over, now as of a joke which still goes on, and it is neither, for at the same time it is over and it goes on, and is there any tense for that?"29 Other devices, such as mis- placed precision ("a kind of muddy pulp, not a muddy pulp, a kind of muddy pulp"30), direct address to the reader, arbitrariness, produce the same effect. The stories told by Malone, the chaotic memories of the Unnamable also contribute to the presentation of a consciousness which is anything but Cartesian in its muddled confusion and maniac self-negation. Beckett's novels function as a mental field from which all the 28Malone Dies (New York, 1956); originally published in French in 1951. 29 Molloy, pp. 46, 102, 47. 80 Malone Dies, p. 69. NEW AESTHETIC | 189</page><page sequence="22">elements traditionally associated with consciousness are progressively excluded. Memory cannot remember, intelligence cannot connect or relate any more than it can perform acts of recognition, the dramatizing or narrative power too winds down, presenting more and more arbitrary and absurd fabrications; in the end all that remains is a voice. The human presence in Beckett's world is finally reducible to speech, yet this function too is self-negating. Speech continues neither to inform nor entertain nor communicate but only to search for the means to silence itself: "The search for the means to put an end to things, an end to speech, is what enables the discourse to continue."31 Consciousness (if we can call it that) is the act of looking for a way to negate consciousness; no more drastically re- duced literary system has ever been created. But in the last analysis it is not the ideological content of Beckett's novels that commands our attention. His greatness does not lie in the fact that he has dramatized Hegelian "unhappy consciousness" or Heideggerian "thrownness" but rather in the emotional power of his novels. Beckett may well be the most qualified spokesman for the atheistic nihilism of his age; but that is irrelevant. Although he stands in direct op- position to the ideological presuppositions of the tradition, Beckett has been profoundly traditional in his use of the novel as an emo- tional matrix where a complex exchange between reader and novelist takes place. The words one uses to describe this are old-fashioned and very simple. We care about his characters; we suffer and (oc- casionally) triumph with them; through them we live hidden dimen- sions of our own selves; they involve us passionately in their world, the world. His characters are both universal and unique; the covers once closed on them, they continue to live with the autonomy of Emma Bovary, Marcel, Julien Sorel. Beckett is a unique and radical writer who rejoins the tradition as decisively as any writer we have considered. This is an argument for which there is no proof. Literature as historical phenomenon pits old concepts against new ones. The old concepts are not mere packaged products, kept in some historical refrigerator, but rather the lived and passionately appropriated responses of the reading public. The new concepts and new forms which the contemporary writer invents are forced on him when he honestly confronts his historical situation. While contemporary readers have grown more and more per- missive, more and more generous in adapting their expectations to 31 The Unnamable, p. 15. 190 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="23">the writer's freedom, the attack on these readers has grown in shrill- ness and vehemence. The reader is accused of complacency; he is accused of rigidity; he is accused of being bourgeois. But the respect which the bourgeois has for the artist is so great that he accepts this critique with a meekness unheard of in any previous period. The reader may know, or intuitively grasp, what many con temporary writers have yet to discover-that the avant-garde is deeply rooted in the tradition. How could it be otherwise? Both writer and reader grew up within the impressive modern tradition which I have attempted to describe; it cannot be abandoned any more than we can abandon our memories of childhood and adolescence. Even in the most radical works of the new aesthetic, the tradition appears in a mutant form or it is echoed or parodied with or without the writer's explicit awareness. Ultimately the "newness" of the new aesthetic has no importance. Its real importance will be determined by assessment of its creative power and the viability of its response to traditional questions.
