<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ehud Luz BUBER'S HERMENEUTICS: THE ROAD TO THE REVIVAL OF THE COLLECTIVE MEMORY AND RELIGIOUS FAITH INTRODUCTION Buber was a typical post-modern thinker: his thinking is based on a critical approach to certain modern assumptions, which he partly ac- cepts and partly rejects. Buber's starting point was the spiritual crisis of our times which he believed to be the most profound ever in the history of mankind; and he saw it primarily as a "crisis of confidence" (Between, 196).1 Buber believed there was an inseparable link between the loss of religious faith and the loss of trust in man. Evidence for this belief he found in the common root amn of the Hebrew terms emuna (faith), emun (trust) and neemanut (loyalty).* He also believed that this double loss-of faith and of trust-has affected not only our attitude to values but also our relation to language which we can no longer take at its face value since we no longer trust the speaker. There could be according to Buber no return to the old, simplistic, pre-critical faith. The only way of coping with the crisis of faith and trust was to look for new ways of teaching, based on an awareness of the depth of the crisis and its causes. In order to do so, he says, we must re- discover the 'genuineness of speech' (Knowledge, 198), namely that we can take it to mean what it says. Buber was well aware of the teacher's loss of authority in our mod- ern age. He repeatedly declared that he had no doctrine of his own and that whoever expected one from him would be disappointed.2 Also, Buber expressed, quite explicitly, his preference for education as op- posed to instruction. He repeatedly declared that he did not believe in methodology but in personalities, and that what mattered most in the educational process was to create a relationship of trust between the ed- ucator and the educatee. He says: "If instruction is directed to the What-it is not educational. If it is directed to the How -it is educa- *All phonetic transcriptions (italicized) in this paper are from Hebrew.

Education is not a matter of What but How, how you teach, how you bring about a meeting."3 However, in spite of Buber's preference for education as opposed to instruction, he nevertheless gave much of his time and energy to the teaching of religious texts, which eventually led to his very extensive interpretive work on the Bible and Hasidism. Through his work he hoped, like another post-modern Jewish thinker- Franz Rosenzweig -to achieve a spiritual reorientation, that is for modern man to turn his glance toward a different reality from the one he has been accustomed to. A study of the ancient religious texts will best serve this purpose. These texts are, in a sense, not available to the non-believer since he considers them completely irrelevant to his world. The problem, then, is: how to bring him closer to these texts and through them to revive his faith, and to restore his trust in language and in man? This was the problem Buber sought to resolve by his hermeneutics. It is clearly not possible to enter into a discussion of Buber's hermeneutics without a knowledge of his theological-historical outlook. We must also clarify what Buber meant by the terms 'tradition' and 'his- tory' and their importance in forming the consciousness of the indi- vidual and the collective. Only then can we discuss his hermeneutical approach to tradition and its implications for teaching. A. BUBER'S CONCEPT OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY AND ITS FUNCTION IN JEWISH FAITH Tradition as a Collective-'Organic' Memory The most basic element of faith, according to Buber, is commitment. Yet the answer to the question, to what should we commit ourselves, is never given to us in advance. It is only given to us through the concrete situation of 'revelation', namely the direct meeting with God. What we receive in revelation is not a set of norms and beliefs, which can be a source of tradition, but purely 'a presence as strength' which is an assur- ance that our life in the world has meaning. We cannot explain or con- vey this meaning to another as "universally valid" objective truth. This truth is ours alone and it is only in living by it, by putting it to the test in action that we make this truth fully ours (I and Thou, 158-159). This may lead one to conclude that Buber's religious faith was a completely individual one, in no way connected with the common tradi- tion of a historical community. Since there is no possibility of preparing for a "revelation'" then one cannot educate toward such an event.4 In- deed, in the light of Buber's concept of faith the answer to the question: how can a collective tradition help the individual to be open to faith, is 70</page><page sequence="3">Buber's Hermeneutics by no means a simple one. However, I believe that the claim, by some of his critics, that Buber did not attach much importance to history and tradition,5 must be greatly qualified. A careful study of Buber's writings will reveal that Buber's 'history' category is essentially different from the commonly accepted one among historical scholars. His 'history' is not a mere record of historical events as such but, rather, a religious concept bound up with a collective memory, which is transmitted through a living tradition. It accords with Y. H. Yerushalmi's definition of Biblical 'memory' as distinct from 'history': Not only is Israel under no obligation whatever to remember the en- tire past, but its principle of selection is unique unto itself. It is above all God's acts of intervention in history, and man's response to them, be they positive or negative, that must be recalled ... For the real dan- ger is not so much that what happened in the past will be forgotten, as the more crucial aspect of how it happened.6 (my emphasis) Buber too was, generally speaking, not so much interested in 'what happened' as in 'how' it happened. It was this spiritual aspect of history that was 'handed down' as tradition and retained in the collective mem- ory. And it was precisely with the revival of this collective memory that Buber was most passionately concerned. He believed that of all the degenerative processes in Jewish life in recent generations, the most dangerous was the degeneration of the col- lective memory and the passion for handing it down (Israel, 147). For the Jewish people is a "community based on memory" a memory that is transferred from one generation to another and whose scope is ever growing. Buber called it "organic memory" because it has been the source of the life and strength of the community. This collective memory has not, with any other nation, had such a dominant influence as with the Jewish people. Among all other nations the historical memory is only one of several elements in the spiritual life of the people, and it is called upon only in very special circumstances; whereas with the Jewish people, their whole spiritual life is bound up with it. Jewish history cannot be apprehended as a chain of objective events. Its essence can only be grasped as a chain of substantive re- sponses to these events; and these responses are the product of their collective memory. In other words, the response of the Jewish people to all objective historical events is filtered through the prism of their col- lective memory (ibid). And this collective memory, or tradition, which is kept alive by the instinct to "hand down'" is essentially dynamic in char- acter. The people understands itself and perceives its self-image mirrored in the Bible. They bear "in their bones" and in their hearts, the memory 71</page><page sequence="4">Ehud Luz of what happened to their fathers and forefathers. But this memory is not self-produced-it derives from the instinct to "hand down" which "kindled each of our sons the moment he became a father" (Israel, 147). Moreover, each generation, in handing down what it had received, also added to its own experiences. Textual tradition alone could not have ac- tivated the memory without the help of the model provided by the living tradition, namely, the communal way of life. The uniqueness ofJudaism is in the live manner tradition is handed down: as oral teaching or, more correctly, as actual experience. This transmission is, therefore, not a handing down of a finished product: the new generation can receive the Torah only if it renews it. The merger of the static with the dynamic creative element of tradition occurs spontaneously: each generation is convinced that it is merely car- rying on the old tradition, whereas it may actually "be the originator of a new movement." This holds forJudaism due to the intensity that, time and again, has characterized the encounters between generations. "The encounters [create] a change of values [without appearing to change anything at all]." (Israel, 138-139). Buber says: "With us nothing has ever come to the fore unless it has set out to be a continuation, a link, or a reply" (Darko, 361). To sum up: it is clear that what was handed down from generation to generation was not, according to Buber, dogmatic in content, nor was it purely subjective experience. What was handed down is a living truth, the memory of a real event, of a meeting. In this way the collective reli- gious tradition can help the individual to be open to faith. To clarify this point we must first consider Buber's concept of language and of myth- the two instruments of 'organic memory'. Buber's Concept of Language It is generally believed, says Buber, that the function of language is pri- marily descriptive. Through the medium of words, and of nouns refer- ring to things, man becomes cognizant of reality, brings law and order into it, and subjects it to his needs. Language-scientific language in particular-invests reality with a fixed form, which sets limits to man's world and makes it monological. The source of this concept of lan- guage, says Buber, is to be found in the Grecian world where everything was "worked over and hammered into shape" (On Bible, 215) and whose 'logos' was an eternal present (ibid). Buber, however, believed that the primary function of language was communicative and not descriptive. Not things but situations are pri- mary. In ancient times language appears mainly to be an "event in mu- tuality" (On Bible, 216) namely a transmission and receipt of a message concerning an actual situation taking place between two people bound 72</page><page sequence="5">Buber's Hermeneutics together by a particular dependence on each other (Knowledge, 117). Language, by its very nature, belongs therefore to what Buber calls "the between" (Knowledge, 112) or "middle sphere" through which two per- sons are brought together. In its dialogical function it reflects the living reality, which by its nature is dynamic and requires a flexible medium to express it. Language, in its pristine power, is not a single-level structure of meanings but, rather, a set of expanding devices that divests words of their single-meaningness and invests them with multi-meaningness; or, we may say, makes them many-faceted and variously interpretable.7 It is these two valuable attributes of language-its capacity to set up a dialogue relationship and its potential store of meanings which cannot be exhausted-that enables it even to transcend the bounds of logic (which can transmit objective experiences only) and enter the world of faith. These qualities Buber mainly finds in the language of the Hebrew Bible, since it reflects the simple biblical concept of truth, whose root amn means neemanut (faithfulness), faithfulness of man, or the faithful- ness of God (Knowledge, 120). 'Biblical truth' means that which is fixed and unchanging, that which is reliable-not as something we know and acknowledge, but something we do and experience: It is, in the first place, faithful truth in relation to the reality which was once perceived and is now expressed, to which it opens wide the win- dow of language in order that it may become directly perceptible to the hearer. It is, secondly, faithful truth in relation to the person ad- dressed, whom the speaker means as such. Thirdly, it is the truth of the word that is genuinely spoken, faithful truth in relation to the speaker, that is, to his factual existence in all its hidden structure (Knowledge, 120). The spoken language in its openness on the one hand and in the authenticity of its expression on the other hand, serves as the first vehi- cle of 'organic'-collective memory. Myth as an Operative Force in Jewish History Buber's positive attitude to myth places him in opposition to all the ra- tionalistic trends in modern Jewish philosophy that seek to disengage Jewish monotheism from myth (Herman Cohen, Yehezkel Kaufman). Myth, like language, belongs ontologically to the "middle sphere", the "between'" but while language creates a link between persons, myth links the past with the present. It is, according to Buber, the medium best adapted to the nature of religious revelation as an expression, and evidence, of "the concrete meeting between man and God. It is in the encounter itself that we are confronted with something compellingly an- thropomorphic, something demanding reciprocity" (Eclipse, 23). 73</page><page sequence="6">The myth contains both a human and a divine element, both theo- morphic and anthropomorphic assertions. This is the source of its spe- cial place in religion, as the middle sphere between the dialogical aspect of faith and its traditional formulation.8 In Buber's words: "It is the spon- taneous and appropriate language both of the future-oriented faith that looks forward and the past-oriented faith that looks back, but is not it- self the essence of faith" (Kinigtum, XI). What then is the truth contained in the myth? What is the nature of its persuasive power? What is its function in the religious life? One of Buber's definitions of myth is: a tale concerning a concrete, sensuous event that was perceived as a divine manifestation. The myth should not, however, be regarded simply as the product of the imagination. The 'truth' of the myth, Buber emphasizes, is a historical truth. It is "a real event retained in the popular memory which molded and formed it in an organic historical process over the centuries, in the course of hand- ing it down from generation to generation."9 Buber rejects the sugges- tion that this phenomenon could belong to the realm of popular psychology: a meeting with fateful events, such as those described in myth, cannot be merely the product of the imagination, and one must assume that it has "a genuine substance" (Moses, 16). This, of course, is an assumption that cannot be verified empirically; it is, in other words, a matter of faith. At all events, the outstanding feature of the monotheis- tic myth, as opposed to pagan myth, is its perfect "naturalness" It main- tains a strict distinction between the human and the divine sphere and, so, does not blur man's sober vision.'0 Like language, myth is not informative but communicative: it does not claim to give an objective world-picture, as science does, but opens a door for us to a profound truth that can only be expressed through the medium of symbolic metaphor. The superiority of the symbolic myth over the plain, scientific statement lies in the concreteness of the symbol on the one hand and its multiple meaning on the other. The symbol always points beyond itself toward new possible experiences, from which it follows that it bears in its bosom a vast potential for free, cre- ative activity. On the other hand, the 'historicity' of the myth, namely, the fact that it is based on a real historical event, is of decisive impor- tance for understanding its persuasive power and its influence on men's minds. The function of the myth in religious life is that it serves the organic memory by (a) keeping the past experience alive in men's minds and (b) relating it to the present. "Every myth'" says Buber, "even the most fantastic, [is the product of a seed in] the organically shaping mem- ory... what once happened [is still happening], the event is still alive and at work in men's souls" (my italics) (On Bible, 138). The sacred historical saga itself becomes a historical force which continues to operate beyond 74 Ehud Luz</page><page sequence="7">Buber's Hermeneutics the time and place of the actual event. The exodus from Egypt, for example, has become part of the people's experience precisely because it is based primarily on an actual historical event. "A great history- [based] faith does not come into the world through interpretation of the extra-historical as historical, but by receiving an occurrence experi- enced as a "wonder"; that is, as an event which cannot be grasped ex- cept as an act of God" (Prophets, 46). In fact a mythical event has the nature of a miracle. The essence of a miracle according to Buber is: that at the time it occurs "we feel it to be a divine act" This feeling arouses a sense of wonder that cannot be dis- pelled by scientific reasoning. A miracle is not something "supernatural" or "superhistorical' but an event which may be fully included in the objective scientific nexus of nature and history. [Yet its] vital meaning for the person to whom it occurs, destroys the security of the whole nexus of knowledge for him and explodes the fixity of the fields of experience we term "Nature" and "History." (Moses, 76) Again, The current system of cause and effect becomes, as it were, transparent and provides a glimpse of the sphere in which a sole power, not re- stricted by any other, is at work. To live with the miracle means to rec- ognize this power on every given occasion as the [operative] one (Moses, 76-77). In handing down the mythic testimony of the meeting, each genera- tion in turn rediscovers this operative power as a power that revealed it- self in the past to former generations. The old mythic pictures give birth to new ones suited to the new situations, while retaining their historical connection. It is the memory of God's covenant with their forefathers that makes them all links in a single chain. The God who revealed him- self to our forefathers and guided them on their way, the God to whom they, in return, were faithful, is the same God revealed to Moses in the burning bush. Moses recognized God's revelation to him as identical with the original revelation, but in a new form and setting (Moses, 44). Moreover, his own experience of a face to face meeting with God be- came a profound experience precisely because he recognized that the God who appeared to him was the God of his forefathers. And what is true of the great personalities of the Bible is true also of the great spiri- tual leaders in every age (Prophets 234-235). Even the most personal mystic experience, such as that of great Hasidim resides in the shadow of the historical revelation and never leaves that sphere. Their God is the God of Sinai and their extremely personal Torah came into being through a merger with the historical Torah. 75</page><page sequence="8">Ehud Luz From this we may understand that the secret of the influence of the Bible on theJewish historical consciousness lies in the operative force of its myth: whoever reads it with faith and sincerity must necessarily be af- fected by the awareness he has acquired from it. What has been, is, and will be for ever. "And the fact of its happening to us is [evidence] of its having happened. The Bible has, in the form of a glorified remem- brance, given vivid, decisive expression to an ever recurring happening" (On Judaism, 215-216). Overt History and Covert History The moral lesson the Jewish people derived, time and again, from their history-or, more correctly, from their organic memory-was the power to continue the dialogue, to stand the test. "Biblical humanism" repeatedly demanded they carry on and bear the trials of this world pa- tiently as partners of God (On Bible, 216). The Jewish faith has proved to be an enduring power that has enabled the Jews to survive as a people and to remain faithful to what E. Fackenheim calls their "root experi- ences" despite the fact that the prevailing reality seemed to deny them. The ability of the Jewish people to stand the test and not to re- nounce the world, derives, according to Buber, from their particular way of contemplating the process of human history, a way quite differ- ent from that of other nations." From the prophets, and from their organic memory the Jewish peo- ple have learnt that the real history of the world is covert, or hidden his- tory. In world history, what determines the importance of events is achievement and success, whereas the Bible attaches no particular im- portance to achievement or success (On Bible, 142): What we are accustomed to call history is, from the biblical standpoint, only the facade of reality. It is the great failure-not the failure in the dialogue as exemplified by the biblical man, but the refusal to enter into the dialogue. This great refusal is sanctioned with the imposing sanction provided by so-called history. The bible categorically rejects this superficial view and does so most vigorously through the prophets. The bible teaches us that the road, the true road, leading from the Creation to the Kingdom of God is not in the sphere of success but in the depths of failure (On Bible, 15, 133). A constantly recurring motif in Buber's writing is precisely this dis- tinction between overt history-in which success appears to be domi- nant whereas in actual fact, failure is more prevalent-and covert history-in which failure seems to dominate whereas, in actual fact, there is achievement and success: 76</page><page sequence="9">Buber's Hermeneutics History has much to teach us, but we must know how to receive her teaching. These temporary triumphs which are apt to catch our atten- tion are nothing but the stage-setting for universal history. If we keep our eyes fixed on the foreground, the true victories, won in secret, sometimes look like defeats. True victories happen slowly and imper- ceptibly, but they have far-reaching effects. In the limelight, our faith that God is Lord of history may sometimes appear ludicrous; but there is something secret in history which confirms our faith (Land, 105). False prophets, in every generation, place a high value on success, and this is what they promise the people. True prophets, on the other hand, know that "ten failures can add up to a victory, provided the spirit stands firm" (On Bible, 170). They are therefore committed to struggle even when success seems to elude them. But their failure is only in their own time and not in respect of the future of their people, as testified by the continued survival of the Jewish people. For we live by the power of the faith of those who struggled to hold on to their faith despite the so- cial and political reality that confronted them (Israel, 111). The influence of the spirit is therefore slow, and hidden from the eye-and, so too, according to Buber, education should be. The lot of the man who lives by the spirit is a tragic one, but his spirit never flags, he never despairs. The careful observer sees everywhere, and always, that history exerts its influence indirectly. Its allies are "hidden powers" And these hidden powers serve the spirit by developing processes that bring about a meeting between objective reality and the tendencies of the spirit that point the way: "Again and again, unexpectedly and unpre- dictably, it (the spirit) causes what is intrinsic in the course of history, through its agents--faithful courage and faithful love" (Israel, 176). Judiasm as a Spiritual Process Rooted in the Organic Memory We come closer now to the answer to the question posed to Buber: What value did he ascribe to Jewish history and tradition? History is a dia- logue, a chain of encounters and meetings between the people and their God; and we can only apprehend its significance if we are ad- dressed personally. And only when we respond to the words addressed to us personally do we realize that in this chain of encounters there is both compulsion and free choice: on the one hand, each generation is required to decide anew concerning its faith; on the other hand, how- ever, in the very act of deciding it becomes aware of a certain compul- sion through an inner need to respond to tradition. Hence, the 'truth' ofJudaism is not a static dogmatic truth, but a dy- namic creative truth. It is not confined to a single moment in history, such as, for example, the giving of the Torah at Sinai, but includes every 77</page><page sequence="10">period in which creative faith was manifested. And every such period constitutes a milestone on the way to this 'truth'. The 'truth' of Judaism is "its entire development, with all its transformations" (On Judaism, 162). It is clear that Buber sees Judaism as a utopian force. Jewish his- tory is not something finished and complete, "it is, rather, a gigantic process... of spiritual creativity, and [our] response to the uncondi- tional" (OnJudaism, 164). In order to receive a spark of this spiritual creativity, one must un- derstand the true nature of this process, one must follow its whole de- velopment up to the present. To this end, scientific study and mythical experience must cooperate in a way I shall discuss later. The bond with the hidden forces of history is a way to self-knowledge. The individual discovers that the life that throbs within his body grows and merges with the life of a chain of generations. He discovers within himself the forces that lifted up his people and brought them down, that made them a great nation and also a curse among the nations. But he also finds within himself the pristine image of his people, the image that is dor- mant and waits to be redeemed. Buber believed that the Jewish historical myth preserved in the peo- ple's memory contains a universal normative message, namely, Hebrew humanism -which Buber discovers in the Bible. What we call 'Israel' is not merely the result of biological and historical development; it is the product of a decision made, long ago, in favour of a God of justice ... in favor of a God who leads his people into the Land in order to prepare them for their messianic work in the world ... Nowhere else was the destiny of a people so bound up with its original choice and the attempts to realize that choice (Israel, 158-159). The 'original decision' rooted in the organic memory, has therefore normative force, that is, the power to legislate for all the generations. And while "these normative primal forces" of the organic memory do not contain rigid, unequivocal directives like a set of formulated laws, they supply us with a criterion for "distinguishing right from wrong, true from false; and to these forces life subjects itself" (On Bible, 213).12 This is the source of Buber's criticism of secular Zionism with its 'normalizing' tendency which asserts that it is enough, for Jewish na- tional revival, to create the conditions for a normal way of life and for the Jewish people to be like other nations. This kind of Zionism severs itself from the 'organic memory' ofJudaism and aspires to create a new chain of continuity (Israel, 147-148). In so doing it denies its strongest and most elemental urge, which is the desire "to return to our origins" as a way to a genuine revival (Israel, 244). It consequently creates an 78 Ehud Luz</page><page sequence="11">Buber's Hermeneutics inner contradiction between Zionist ideology and Zionist practice: Zionist ideology implies a break with tradition, whereas Zionist prac- tice-the return to the Land of the Fathers-stems, at least uncon- sciously, from a desire to return to the ancient roots and revive the tradition (Israel, 158-159). The Zionists' rejection of their 'ancient roots', that is, their 'organic memory', says Buber, is a characteristic symptom of the grave sickness of the Jewish people in recent generations. B. HERMENEUTICS AS A MEANS FOR RESTORING THE ORGANIC MEMORY The Roots of the Religious Crisis and the Crisis of Confidence We have seen that unity and continuity of the generations depends, ac- cording to Buber, on the organic memory nourished by the handing- down of the 'living' tradition from generation to generation. In recent generations, however, this handing-down process has been undermined through the impact of modernization which has brought about the reli- gious crisis and the alienation of man from the religious texts. Buber has, in various studies, illuminated the causes of this phenomenon. I shall try to sum up the main causes which, according to Buber, have had a direct influence on modern man's alienation from the religious tradi- tion: 1. The first cause of the religious crisis is the complete domination of rational empiric science in our apprehension of truth and reality, with the result that the Humanities and all spiritual phenomena have been relegated to a secondary position. Truth and reality are acknowl- edged only as apprehended through the mirror of scientific objectivity; and all human phenomena that cannot be apprehended within the ob- jective categories of science, are treated as merely subjective experi- ences. This overwhelming rationalistic approach exerts a strong impact on our world of values: we tend to refer to science for the answer to the major problems of our existence, with the consequence that 'good' tends increasingly to be equated with 'useful' and 'pleasurable'. 2. The analytic method of science, which fragments reality into lit- tle segments, has been extended to all those sciences that deal with man and his culture. Scientific anthropological research, for example, ig- nores all that is mysterious in human relationships (Knowledge, 81). As a result, the image of the 'whole' man and all that he creates is frag- mented and reduced; and the ancient literary documents that present an image of man in his 'wholeness' become irrelevant. 79</page><page sequence="12">Ehud Luz 3. The Social Sciences-history, sociology and psychology-are fos- tering an ideological prejudice against all human ideas and values. They attempt to reveal the psychological or socio-historical basis of the Hu- manities by a so-called scientific reduction. There is a tendency "to [ex- pose] the world of the spirit as a system of deception and [illusions], of 'ideologies' and 'sublimations' (Eclipse, 142). Modern historicism, that is based on critical scientific research of the past, purports to understand all spiritual and cultural phenomena by reference to their temporal context, thus denying their claim to any absolute validity. Psychology de- duces all human ideas-including religion- from the unconscious levels of the human mind, and sociology stresses the dependence of man's views (his 'ideologies') on his socio-economic interests. The result of all this is a complete relativization of values and ideas (Between, 81) and a complete mistrust, demonic in character, peculiar to our age (Point- ing, 222): One no longer merely fears that the other will voluntarily dissemble, but one simply takes it for granted that he cannot do otherwise. The presumed difference between his opinion and his statement, between his statement and his action, is here no longer understood as his inten- tion, but as an essential necessity. The other communicates to me the perspective as he has acquired on a certain subject, but I do not really take cognizance of his communication as knowledge. I do not take it seriously as a contribution to the information about this subject, but rather I listen for what drives the other to say what he says, for an un- conscious motive, say, or a 'complex' (Pointing, 223). This method completely destroys the possibility of a genuine dia- logue between one man and another. Instead of listening to what the other person is saying, and giving an ear to the matters that are occupy- ing him, we see it as our main task "to fathom his mind and penetrate his soul, that is, to remove the mask from his face" (ibid, 223). Needless to say, this approach which completely destroys our trust in man, also in- fluences our relation to tradition. This so-called 'scientific' approach to man and his world, and the consequent relativization of all spiritual phenomena, have not only re- sulted in a contempt for the humanities, but have also led to a contempt for and mistrust of the spirit itself and its power to shape and fashion our lives, political life in particular. Another aspect of this mistrust is an excessive faith in the power of pragmatic politics. 4. As a result of this ideological mistrust and belittlement of the im- portance of the non-rational elements in shaping man's image, modern man has lost the ability to create symbols and relate to them seriously. Symbolic language serves, as we have seen, to open man to levels of real- 80</page><page sequence="13">Buber's Hermeneutics ity and truth which cannot be communicated through the medium of scientific language. The loss of the symbol-making faculty has caused man to lose also the ability to relate to these levels, which constitute the roots of his being. Man's most important existential questions are be- coming concealed from him, or as Heidegger puts it: he 'forgets' them. Moreover, the concept of autonomy of man-whether based on the ra- tionalism of Enlightenment or on spontaneity and romantic individual- ism-creates great tension between the individual and the collective cultural tradition, the religious tradition in particular. Indeed tradition is perceived as something heretonomous and as such completely op- posed to man's autonomy. 5. Religion itself, which embodies in a rigid, institutionalized form the continuity of tradition, is progressively becoming irrelevant. Its con- cept of truth has become a static one. It has ready answers to all ques- tions and fails to take into account the fact that the existential problems with which it claims to contend, have been covered up and 'forgotten'. "The past is transmitted to us by the religious establishment, in rigid form'; says Buber (Israel, 50). Instead of dealing with the major problems of life, religion is retreating into the narrow confines of ritual and dogma, thus further widening the gap between the spirit and life, be- tween the holy and the secular. The establishment's rigidity of mind and inability to renew itself, together with its coercive nature, have rein- forced the negative image of religion as an institution hostile to man's 'humanity', the source of his dignity, his individuality and his creativity. Dialogical Hermeneutics The causes listed in the foregoing section are summed up in Buber's terms as the "prejudices" or "prejudgments" of the present age, which together constitute "prejudice against faith' We live in a period in which most people reject faith, not as a result of a considered decision, but because the 'prejudices' against faith pre- vent them from 'meeting' with it. 'Prejudice' sets up a psychological bar- rier which blocks independent thought; it creates the illusion of a kind of stable, familiar world in which man lives in apparent safety-but he is in fact bound in chains, and his potential is stifled. In other words 'prej- udices' and 'prejudgments' limit a man's freedom and his positiveness. He becomes superficial, dogmatic, and arrogant declaring that he knows all about himself and the world, and that "Nothing can happen to change me fundamentally and transform the world before my eyes" (Israel, 163). In order to open his heart to faith, his confidence and arro- gance must be shaken. This is the first step to overcoming prejudice. Genuine openness is only possible with a humble attitude toward the 81</page><page sequence="14">Ehud Luz mystery that envelops all reality, human reality in particular. Meeting with the Classic texts is, for the student, a kind of confrontation with prejudice; and the teacher's first duty is to bring the student, through the classical texts, into contact with 'life itself' and its insoluble mystery; and so, to shake his simplistic, dogmatic approach to life. Buber, however, did not completely reject the prejudices we have listed: in each of them he finds a measure of truth, though not the whole truth. His hermeneutic method aims at producing a psychological-cognitive process which will eventually limit the power of the prejudices by assigning areas where the validity of science-every science, but the social sciences in particular-will be recognized (Point- ing, 226). This task Buber refers to as "The criticism of criticism (idem)." In assigning areas of validity to science we are, in effect determining the extent of truth in each of the prejudices. The 'ideological mistrust' must be taken into consideration seriously, but not totally, and not solely, since it is one-sided and, so, unable to perceive the human being as a whole (Between, 81-82). We must, through the medium of hermen- eutics, uncover and confront the existential questions that objective sci- ence has covered up and made us 'forget'; and we must point out the importance of the symbolic language of religion, as a medium which re- veals to man important matters that have so far been concealed from him. The past, which has come down to us in rigid form, must be made more flexible so as to serve as a dynamic, constructive force that will help man to deal with his most important existential problems. Judaism should emerge as an endless spiritual process that allows the individual Jew who has become estranged from Judiasm to overcome his alienation and to find his way back to tradition and to faith. Hermeneutics can play an equally important role in ovecoming the feeling that it is tradition that threatens man's personal liberty and dig- nity as an autonomous being. It is therefore necessary to show that het- eronomy and autonomy are not basically opposed and may co-exist (Eclipse, 129-130). Moreover, not only is there no conflict between free- dom and tradition, but genuine freedom is best attained in a meeting of the two, in a dialogue between man and tradition. This dialectic view of the relation between the individual and tradi- tion is what distinguishes dialogical hermeneutics from traditional hermeneutics. The starting point of traditional hermeneutics is preser- vation of the tradition as a well-defined and irrefutable reality which ex- ists independently of the individual and requires him to conform to it. The starting point of dialogical hermeneutics, on the other hand, is the individual as he is, with his hopes and his doubts, and his intellectual in- dependence, who can approach tradition only through a process of self- discovery that comes from within him. And in this way he will discover that the tradition appeals to him personally, as an individual. 82</page><page sequence="15">Buber's Hermeneutics The aim of this hermeneutics is to foster in the student a readiness to listen without mistrust as well as an attitude of openness to faith; in Buber's words: He has no preconceived beliefs or preconceived disbe- liefs (On Bible, 5). Faith according to Buber is a readiness to commit one- self. As such, it precedes the norms of tradition. But it is also readiness to be shaped by tradition. Hence dialogical hermeneutics aims to foster in the student a kind of value-oriented frame of mind that will enable him to make value decisions. An open mind implies a readiness to con- sider alternative solutions, and then to make his own decisions and take responsibility for them. A dialogical relation to tradition is based on the assumption that the 'I' cannot understand itself without the 'Thou' embodied in the tra- dition. But a genuine understanding must also include the personal in- terpretation that the 'I' gives to tradition-an interpretation that will depend on his position within the tradition. The interpretive act is therefore an essential prerequisite for tradition. It is a guarantee of the vitality and continuity of the tradition. This is of course a non-dogmatic attitude to tradition-which does not mean that tradition has no pre- scriptive force, but that its requirement for commitment is equivocal and variously interpretable. The precise nature of the commitment de- pends on the ability of each individual to listen, to understand and in- terpret the message addressed to him by the tradition, which he treats as relevant to himself and responds to accordingly. Some of the insights of Buber's existential dialogical approach an- ticipate the stand taken by modern philosophers such as Hans G. Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur.'3 Like Buber, Gadamer states that our stand vis a vis tradition is a dialogical one: the past is not to be understood as an object in its own right, existing independently of us; it exists only by virtue of its relation to our concrete present. Understanding a text means discovering a truth or meaning common to both parties in the dialogue-the interpreter and the text. And through its application to the concrete situation, the tradition is kept alive and is transmitted from generation to generation. In this connection we must mention a concept of history intro- duced by Gadamer, that throws light on Buber's own stand concerning the understanding of history. This is the concept of "die Wirkungs- gescgichte", that is, the unity of history with the understanding of it.14 In this unity lies also the "reality of history" (die Wirklichkeit der Gesechichte), or, in other words, "the history of realization" History re- alizes itself when "it works something or works on something" An event is considered to be effectively historical when it continues to operate and exert its influence beyond the time of its actual occurrence. In other words, history is effective when it influences the course of events. The true object of the study of history, according to Gadamer, is there- 83</page><page sequence="16">Ehud Luz fore not the events themselves, but their significance, that is, their "rela- tion to subsequent events" and their application to the present time.15 This concept of 'effective history', Gadamer believes, will enable us to explain the status of the 'classical' texts. 'Classical' is a normative con- cept of an evaluative nature. "What we call 'classical' is something re- trieved from the vicissitudes of changing time and its changing taste''l6 The classical text is repeatedly subjected to examination in the light of new experiences, and its relevance to each new experience is proof of its enduring validity. The term 'classical' therefore stands for "the source of living truth'; potentially and always, addressed to us. Even the scriptures cannot be understood without application to the present since they contain commandments that make a perpetual claim on the present. Any attempt to understand the classical texts without reference to the present fails to reveal their uniqueness which lies in their endur- ing applicability. Normative Understanding as Opposed to Scientific Knowledge With his historical understanding of tradition, Buber refused to ac- knowledge the absolute authority of objective truth-which, or so it seems, scientific research can reveal, and he sought a middle way from the extreme orthodox point of view--that invests tradition with the force of dogma -and the extreme historical point of view for which the past has no normative value. Hence Buber expressly distinguishes be- tween two types of 'historical knowledge':'7 the first is attainable through objective scientific study, and the second, through "the desire to convey to our own time the force of the former life of faith and to help our age renew its ruptured bond with the absolute''8 In the later, the subjectivity of the interpreter is essential for the renewal. We may say that the first type of knowledge is for Buber only an instrument for the second type. A genuine historical understanding, according to Buber-and here he comes very near to Gadamer-is an experience which enables us to enter into a dialogue with former generations. We converse with these generations through the texts they have bequeathed us. The modern interpreter's task, according to Buber, is to reconstruct the living mo- ment in the event of the meeting between the past generation and the divine, in order to transmit this reconstructed moment to the present generation. This task is identical in its purpose with that of the traditional inter- preter. The difference lies in the method: the traditional interpreter was not bound by the formal procedures of modern historicism and there- fore had no need to research the particular, one-time historical circum- stance in which the event, that brought about the meeting, occurred. He was free to extract from the event, as related, whatever he felt was es- 84</page><page sequence="17">Buber's Hermeneutics sential in it. The modern interpreter, on the other hand, cannot ignore scientific historical research and must take it into account in the inter- pretive process. But he must, in addition, also apply his personal intu- ition to arrive at the "operative force" within the text. By exposing the one-time historical circumstances of the spiritual event contained in the text-in so far as this is scientifically possible-he makes the effect of the "operative force" more palpable. This force, embodied in the text- "its voice'" as Buber calls it-has a historical potential that can influence even a generation that has become alienated from faith. The living 'voice', that speaks from the text, sets in motion a process of recalling, that enables him to understand how people believed in the past.19 To all those who, in opposition to Buber, claim that the Bible is a religious book and cannot therefore speak to a non-believer, Buber says: If he (the non-believer) truly and sincerely reads and gets to know the Bible, he will realize or, rather, recall that there was once a people, his own people, who 'heard' what was happening as a 'voice' that spoke to them and made demands on them, and they considered themselves commanded to answer and bear the responsibility for their answer- then, he will remember that, together with them, he too may, in the same way, accept the actuality of history and respond to it as they did. And if he indeed remembers he may feel that now, too, the reality that is occurring may be 'heard' as a voice that demands and com- mands. And if, then, his heart tells him to thank God and call him the Lord of the 'voice' that will be his personal mystery (Darko, 361, my translation). This explains how historical recollection becomes the medium for the restoration of faith. "Hearing the voice" is the first step to faithful- ness, which according to Buber, enables man to be open to faith, to ac- cept responsibility and to stand the test. Buber calls the kind of understanding we have described 'humanis- tic understanding'. Humanistic understanding is, first and foremost, au- thoritative and normative "for it shows us how to distinguish between what is human and what is not human; it bears witness to man and reveals him" (Israel, 243). This aim can be achieved "provided we can separate the timeless elements in this pattern, the elements that are valid for all time, from those that were conditioned by the epoch" (ibid, 244). But how do we distinguish between the 'timeless elements' and those that are 'conditioned by the epoch'? Buber's answer is: historical criticism on the one hand, and our moral sense on the other, will help us make this distinction. Genuine humanism has, therefore, a double task vis a vis tradition-to receive and to criticize. These two tasks are not separable; neither can exist meaningfully without the other; and 85</page><page sequence="18">Ehud Luz only the two together can, says Buber, convert the traditional texts into normative sources (Israel, 243-244). For example, Let us assume I am discussing a text from our literature. It has been in- terpreted countless times and in countless ways. I know that no inter- pretation, including my own, coincides with the original meaning of the text. I know that my interpreting, like everyone else's, is condi- tioned by my being. But if I attend as faithfully as I can to what it contains of word and texture, of sound and rhythmic structure, of open and hidden connections, my interpretation will not have been made in vain--I find something, I have found something [of value]. And if I [convey] what I have found, I guide him who lets himself be guided, to the reality of the text. To him whom I teach I make visible the working forces of the text that I have experienced (Pointing, 100-101). Dialogical Hermeneutics and Pluralism We may conclude, from the previous section, that the tradition is multi- faceted. But this does not mean that anarchy prevails, for there is, basi- cally, recognition not only of the normative authority of tradition but also of its inner unity. Here lies the difference between the person who stands within the tradition and decides from within it, and one who stands outside it. He who stands within sees, from the very outset, that the tradition has many facets-"the Torah has seventy faces"-but he also sees that all these facets, each in its way, are related to their com- mon source. Unity is a matter of faith and not of science. It is not a given, but an end toward which one must strive. This is an unending task that consists in connecting and uniting more and more compre- hensively. Emphasizing the unity of the tradition, despite its many facets and various interpretations, is of prime importance not only for build- ing up the sense of continuity and identity of those who grew up in the tradition, but also to establish a dialogue between them. Judaism is the perfect model of a culture based on dialogical hermeneutics. It accords with Clifford Geertz's definition of culture as a concept that "denotes an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life."20 Dialogical hermeneutics creates a common attitude among all those who partici- pate in the process of creating a culture. It promotes the possibility of a dialogue between persons with different points of view and builds a bridge of understanding between them. Buber knew very well that there can be no genuine community with- out a collective commitment to a text whose authority is generally ac- 86</page><page sequence="19">Buber's Hermeneutics cepted, nor can a community exist without a common myth. The disso- lution of the Jewish community in our time results from the absence of this collective commitment to a common text and the decline of the people's (innate) historical memory. As a way of restoring the commu- nity, he suggests the following: Biblical humanism is concerned with a 'concrete transformation' of our total-and not only our inner- lives. This concrete transforma- tion can only follow upon a rebirth of the normative primal forces that distinguish right from wrong, true from false; and to which life submits itself. The primal forces are transmitted to us in the word, the biblical word... This primal force enables a community to perceive and com- ply with what has been proclaimed to it; it enables the leader to pro- claim to this community, as revealed word, what they ought to perceive and comply with- for he may not in any way consider himself to be the source of such proclamation. We are no longer a community capa- ble of this. But if we will open ourselves to the biblical word, if the indi- vidual will let it affect his personal life and open himself to the authority of the normative, then we may hope that the persons so af- fected-in varied ways, yet all as one-will once again coalesce into a community in the primal meaning of the concept (On Bible, 214-215). Collective listening to the 'voice' through collective study will create an openness and a sense of belonging between those who participate in this common activity, and will become a vital, binding element. But we are today "no longer a community capable of this': And this fact obliges us to be supremely tolerant in the loftiest sense of the word. This is one of the most important aims of education: The work of education unites the participating groups... into a model of the great community. This community is no union of the like- minded, but a genuine living together of men of similar or comple- mentary natures but of differing minds ... The question is not one of exercising 'tolerance', but of making present the roots of community and its ramifications, of so experiencing and living in the trunk that one also experiences, as truly as one's own, where and how the other boughs branch off and shoot up. It is not a question of a formal appar- ent understanding on a minimal basis, but of an awareness from the other side of the other's real relation to the truth. What is called for is not 'neutrality' but solidarity, a living answering for one another-and mutuality, living reciprocity; not effacing the boundaries between the groups, circles, and parties, but communal recognition of the common reality and communal testing of the common responsibility" (Pointing, 102). 87</page><page sequence="20">Ehud Luz A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT A. One of Buber's main concerns, as aJewish thinker and educator, was to revive the myth ofJewish life. He considered the mythical memory to be the constant source ofJewish collective life and continuity. Buber was not the only one, in Zionist circles, to advocate the revival of the myth. Berdichevsky was another, and there were others too. But Buber was the only one to give it a systematic, scholarly basis. His efforts to reconstruct the mythic experience on which the collective memory is based; his call to restore the historical myth to its rightful place and make it a central element in the revival and renewal of the national-religious life-all these deserve high praise since they accord with the spirit of Jewish history. While we may accept Buber's contention thatJewish spiritual revival is not possible without a living connection with the Jewish myth, we can- not avoid pointing out the problem involved in Buber's concept of such a revival. As Buber has clearly stated historical events are not by them- selves significant. They become real or-in Buber's words-"operative forces" only through interpretation and reinterpretation by successive generations of men. The Jewish myth, moreover, does not contain a clear, unequivocal message. It has its 'dark' aspects which certainly do not accord with Buber's humanistic spirit. The myth can bear chauvinis- tic as well as humanistic interpretation. Thus, for instance, Buber's highly humanistic interpretation contrasts sharply with Uri Zvi Green- berg's extreme chauvinistic interpretation of the myth. And while they agree in criticising secular Zionism for its disregard of myth as a vital force in the national revival, they differ radically in their application of theJewish myth to politics. Every actualization of a myth-a socio-political actualization in par- ticular-is fraught with both favourable possibilities and with a degree of danger. On the one hand, as Nietzsche pointed out, without a myth the culture loses its solid and creative force; but on the other hand, a myth can be implemented by selfish and crooked politicians for anti- humanistic purposes. A myth unchecked by reason or by socio-spiritual forces can become a highly destructive and barbaric force. Against this explosive force of the myth, Jewish tradition has set up a restraining force-the Halacha. Although the Halacha derives its authority from a non-rational source, it developed historically along rational lines, its rules being determined by discussion and exchange of opinion among the sages. Consequently it served as an effective foil, that brought about the humanization of the historical myth, a process that is clearly re- flected in the development ofJewish law from the biblical period to the time of the sages. There is no doubt that Buber himself knew of the dangers inherent 88</page><page sequence="21">Buber's Hermeneutics in every myth, dangers that manifested themselves in all their awesome- ness precisely in the totalitarian movements of the 20th century. He tried to overcome these dangers by means of an interpretation calcu- lated to harness the dynamic forces of the myth to the service of univer- sal human ends. We may even say that Buber's special place in the field of national thought is due to his efforts to bring about a merger of myth- ical structures and humane social principles.2' This marriage of the myth with humane values creates a framework for the emergence of a new fellowship of men. But did Buber succeed in his efforts to counter- act the dangers inherent in the myth? Since he refused to recognize the binding force of Jewish law, what binding force on the people as a whole could he claim for his subjective interpretation?22 Moreover, Buber's moral theory, which underlies his humanistic in- terpretation, poses another problem. The 'situational' morality he advo- cates ('the demarcation line') shifts the whole responsibility on to the individual, who has to make his decision in every new situation without concrete normative criteria and with only very general principles to guide him. This means that even in a moral decision the decisive factor is a subjective one. Can a humanistic world view renounce its emphasis on the normative factor which provides clear and unequivocal criteria for 'the ought'?23 B. Buber's denial of the importance of the Halacha for contemporary Jewish life raises a further problem. Buber himself acknowledges the fact that the collective memory was an inseparable part of the Jewish way of life, and that its transmission from generation to generation was made possible in the past by its peculiar blending of this memory with the way of life. It was the Halacha -through the medium of prayer, fes- tivals and ritual-that ensured the perpetuation of this memory. One can also say that Judaism survived as a Halachic chain of continuity no less than as a mythic chain of continuity. It was the Halacha that gave an objective dimension to the community's faith, and so enabled the Jews to internalize spiritual values and transmit them from generation to generation. But since Buber denies the value of Halacha for the present time, we ask to what extent can study, divorced from such an ordered, rule-governed way of life of a historical community, bring about a re- vival of the 'organic-collective memory' and a consequent renewal of faith, as Buber expected? We may agree with Buber that the dialogical approach advocated by him is most appropriate for alienated students who wish to find their way back to tradition without forgoing their intel- lectual probity. However, from educational point of view we have to ac- knowledge that this approach is not suitable for all, since it requires sophistication, sensitivity and intellectual independence- qualities pos- sessed only by exceptional persons.24 89</page><page sequence="22">Ehud Luz C. The application of a myth raises further questions: What, according to Buber, is the relationship between the mythical consciousness and the empirical-historical knowledge which is based on the rational- critical judgment of factors at work in human history? He explicitly asks us "to be true to the spirit ... within the bounds of reality" (A Land, 96); yet he does not provide us with clear criteria by which one can judge and assess what is that 'reality' within which we should operate. In the same way as he made an oversharp distinction between 'I-Thou' and 'I-It' relations, Buber appears to have failed to show the connection between the collective mythic memory and empirical knowledge. Al- though there is a clear difference between 'memory' and 'history'-as Y. H. Yerushalmi has noted25-one cannot completely separate between them.26 Hence, Buber's belief that the Jewish people succeeded in surviving through the ages by virtue of their attachment to the collective memory and to their mission is only partly true. For the Jewish people have sur- vived also by their ability to adjust to the reality in which they lived. Bu- ber's failure to take more seriously into account empirical knowledge, can lead to a disregard of the actual historical factors that have influ- enced the fate of the Jewish people and a consequent disregard of the dangers that threaten them. How to combine mythical consciousness and empirical knowledge and give each its due weight within the frame- work of our pragmatic political decisions-this is one of the major ques- tions that faces the Zionist movement, whose aim was, in common parlance, to bring the Jewish people back to its history. Buber's failure to show the actual connection between 'memory' and 'history' is also reflected in his textual studies. Buber never clearly designated the limits of the application of critical historical science for hermeneutics, nor did he sufficiently estimate its importance as an edu- cational tool that could protect us from arbitrariness and self-delusion. As a result we sometimes find in Buber a dangerous blurring of the dif- ferences between the literal meaning of a text and its homiletical inter- pretation. This tends to make Buber suspect and unreliable to all those whose intellectual conscience does not allow them to ignore the achievements of critical historical science.27 Buber's attempt to find his own independent way to an understanding of Jewish tradition-a way different from orthodoxy on the one hand, and critical science on the other-was not always successful.28 His strong desire to emphasize cer- tain basic elements in Judaism -elements that accorded with his theo- logical concept-caused him to ignore or to dim other elements no less important than those he chose to emphasize. To sum up, I believe we can accept the considered opinion of Bu- ber's outstanding disciple, E. A. Simon. Simon criticizes Buber's one- sided view of Judaism, a view that ignores the true continuity of Jewish 90</page><page sequence="23">Buber's Hermeneutics history. For Judaism is not only a personal-existential but also a socio- historical phenomenon. It is not only a kind of 'Thou' but also a kind of 'It' that we are required to know. Buber's greatness as a teacher lies, says Simon, in the 'initial spark' that he instilled in his students, a spark that continued to inspire and activate them even after they became dissatis- fied with his directives and seemed to reject them.29 Buber, very likely, did not seek to achieve more than this 'initial spark'. But how manyJew- ish thinkers of our times have achieved as much? NOTES 1. Short titles are used for Buber's works in this paper and are given below: Between-Between Man and Man, trans.

Concerning the Baal Shem-Tov, Buber says: "Reality calls forth reality; the reality of a man who has lived in intercourse with the reality of being in its fullness, awakens the reality in us and helps us to live in intercourse with the re- ality of being in its fullness'" M. Buber, Origin and Meaning in Hasidism (New York, 1970), p. 71. 20. C. Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (New York, 1973), p. 89. 21. Concerning this combination of the myth with humanism see: Uriel Tal, "Mitos, Solidariyut ve-Shivat Zion be-Darko shel M. Buber", in Mitos u-Tvuna be- Yahadut Yameinu (Tel Aviv, 1987), p. 89. See too, the distinction Simon finds in Buber's writings, between the "clear" and the "dark" myth. The "clear myth" cannot operate by itself; its actualization is conditional on the observance of certain moral requirements. Qav Ha-Tihum, pp. 55-56. 22.
