DFl. 50. Reviewed by WILLIAM BODIFORD University of California, Los Angeles The designation Watarai Shinto generally refers to a body of teachings that were first delimited and named Ise (or Iseryu) Shinto by the followers of Yamazaki Ansai (1618-82) during the Tokugawa period. The appellation Ise was meant to distinguish these teachings from the then better-known Ryobu and Yoshida flavors of Shinto scholasticism and to indicate that they originated at the shrines of Ise. Modern historians tend to favor the name Watarai (or Outer Shrine, geku) Shinto to indicate that these teachings origi- nated within the Watarai family alone and, thus, to distinguish them from the traditions of Ise as a whole. The fact that this topic lacks even a uniform name should alert the reader to note that there is no scholarly consensus as to what the fundamental teachings of Watarai Shinto might have been, as to their historical development, or as to their ultimate significance for our un- derstanding of Japanese culture. Mark Teeuwen is to be commended, there- fore, not just for making accessible a difficult topic demanding considerable historical and linguistic skill but also for his willingness to tackle conten- tious issues of interpretation directly pertinent to the construction of Japa- nese cultural identity. Teeuwen's study is comprehensive in scope, covering Watarai doctrines from their origins in the late thirteenth century through the Tokugawa period down to their final abolishment in 1871. It consists of three long chapters plus a brief introduction and conclusion. The heart of the first chapter, "Early Watarai Shinto" (pp. 11-131), lies in Teeuwen's detailed analysis of Ise shrine oracles that were first revealed in the course of economic rival- ries in 1296. That was the period when Watarai Yukitada (1236-1305) first 361 Journal of Japanese Studies, 24:2 ? 1998 Society for Japanese Studies</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Japanese Studies compiled the textual foundations of the Watarai family teachings. In con- trast to scholars who assert that Watarai teachings constituted an anti- Buddhist awakening of Shinto-inspired nationalism (e.g., Kubota Osamu) or that Watarai teachings should not even be thought of as "Shinto" (e.g., Hagiwara Tatsuo, who notes that they present no systematic theory of shrine worship) or that Watarai teachings were a kind of Buddhism (e.g., Kuroda Toshio, who notes their reliance on a Buddhist cosmological framework), Teeuwen finds in these oracles a new theory of Shinto worship in which lay people attain spiritual union with the gods. As indicated by its title, "Con- tinuity and Discontinuity" (pp. 132-219), the second chapter reviews two contradictory processes. While formal initiation into Watarai teachings came to a complete end after 1349 when Ashikaga forces seized control of Ise (pp. 150, 164), Teeuwen argues that significant Watarai influences sur- vived, not just in the political writings of Kitabatake Chikafusa (1293- 1354), who studied at Ise before 1349, but also in subsequent Ryobu, Yoshida, and Confucian notions of Shinto self-cultivation. The third chap- ter, "Late Watarai Shinto" (pp. 220-389), surveys the scholarly fate of sur- viving Watarai writings as they were reinterpreted in accordance with the intellectual vicissitudes of Tokugawa Japan. Teeuwen's thesis will no doubt become the standard work on Watarai Shinto for many decades to come. Nowhere else can one find such a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the development of one type of Shinto scho- lasticism and its intellectual influence from the Kamakura period to the present. For this reason alone it deserves wide readership among scholars. Be forewarned, however, that it is not always written in a style intended to be accessible to nonspecialists. Teeuwen sometimes introduces events, tech- nical terms, and proper names without identifying them (e.g., p. 38 is in- comprehensible without the additional information on p. 321). Readers un- familiar with Watarai Shinto probably will find it easier to peruse his conclusions first, since that is where he summarizes his evidence and inter- prets its significance. In perusing Teeuwen's conclusions readers also should be aware that their vast historical breadth (spanning both Kamakura texts and Tokugawa commentaries) occasionally dictates methodological choices that allow one to question Teeuwen's selection of evidence and its interpre- tation. For this reason Teeuwen's thesis demands careful review. Before dis- cussing specific issues, however, it is useful to briefly recall the larger his- torical significance of Ise. The institution that today we commonly speak of as the Ise Shrine con- sists of two completely separate, yet related, shrine compounds: one tradi- tionally known as the Watarai Jingu, serviced throughout most of Japanese history by celebrants (negi) of the Watarai family lineage, and another one located 17 miles away with the grandiose tide of Kotai (imperial) Jingu, historically serviced by celebrants of the Arakida family lineage. Officers 362 24:2 (1998)</page><page sequence="3">Review Section from a third family lineage, the Onakatomi (a.k.a. Nakatomi), supervised both shrine compounds from the capital in their roles as Master of Rites (saishu) and Shrine Governor (giji). These officers would, according to Heian law codes such as the Engi shiki (ca. 927), travel to Ise four times each year to oversee royal supplications on behalf of the reigning monarch (tenno, a.k.a. emperor), first at the main shrine of the Watarai complex and next at the main shrine of the Kotai complex. Royal supplications duly au- thorized by the monarch and correctly presented on his behalf insured the tranquility of the realm and, thus, symbolized the sovereign's unique author- ity. No one else but the monarch could legitimate the government by com- missioning the performance of rites at the imperial sanctuary of Ise. But this ritual logic could work in the opposite direction as well: anyone who wished to usurp the throne could (or, rather, must) do so by asserting control over these same ritual offerings. For this reason, law codes forbade anyone other than the sovereign, and especially forbade other members of the royal family, from personally authorizing supplications at Ise. In short, the law codes present an image of Ise as being not so much a shrine of the govern- ment nor as an ancestral shrine of the royal family as a whole but rather as being primarily a shrine of rulership and of royal succession.1 This Heian-period image of Ise as sanctuary of extreme exclusivity, for- bidden to even the most privileged aristocrats, stands in stark contrast to Ise's subsequent emergence as premodern Japan's most popular pilgrimage destination. Almost every year during the latter half of the Tokugawa period hundreds of thousands pilgrims from all levels of society marched to Ise. The o'kage mairi years of 1771, 1830, and 1887 especially saw millions of pilgrims from every area of Japan clog the routes to Ise singing and dancing with a millenarian fervor that alarmed government officials and helped to usher in the Meiji coup d'etat.2 How could such a fundamental and far-reaching transformation of the social role of the Ise institutions have occurred? In many ways the answers to this question would help explain how similar Japanese sanctuaries of dreadful, exclusive familial and territorial gods that originally served to sanctify social privilege and control over lands and peoples by ruling elites gradually assumed the characteristics of multifaceted religious cults that competed among themselves for the broadest possible appeal to all social groups. In other words, it would tell the story of the emergence of Shinto shrine worship as a religion universally shared by the entire Japanese 1.

Although Teeuwen never raises this point directly, the real signifi- cance of Watarai Shinto, and of Teeuwen's contribution to its study, lies in what it reveals about the historical development and nature of Japanese Shinto as a whole. This is why the topic of Watarai or Ise Shinto has been subject to so many ideological debates since the Tokugawa period. Teeuwen's analysis of Tokugawa-period debates over Watarai teachings is the most successful section of his book. It is especially useful for the way he carefully situates new Watarai interpretations within larger intellectual trends and within the legal context of ongoing disputes over the economic proceeds generated by the Ise pilgrimage system. Teeuwen shows how early neo-Confucian scholars such as Hayashi Razan (1583-1657) and Yamazaki Ansai promoted the study of pseudohistorical Watarai texts in order to iden- tify Chinese concepts such as serious-mindedness (jing, Japanese kei, trans- lated by Teeuwen as "reverence") and principle (li, Japanese ri) with Chinese notions of mind-god (shinshin) and returning to a state of primor- dial chaos (konton), which the Watarai texts presented as ancient teachings of early Japan. They believed that these works preserved elements of a Japanese worldview that was anti-Buddhist but compatible with neo- Confucianism. Yamazaki even identified specific Watarai pseudohistories as Shinto's Five Books (Shinto gobu sho) to be studied in his Suika school. The subsequent rise of the School of Ancient Learning (kogaku), however, subjected these Five Books to a degree of philological scrutiny that they could not withstand. Eventually Yoshimi Yukikazu (1673-1716), an offici- ant of the Owari Toshogu Shrine who first studied and then rejected the Suika approach, published detailed studies in which he revealed the Five Books as medieval counterfeits and denounced the Watarai leaders as frauds motivated by selfish greed. Yoshimi Yukikazu asserted that Shinto is iden- tical with the royal succession alone; it is not concerned with individual spiritual cultivation and should not be tainted by forms of worship con- ducted by ordinary people. Scholars of Ancient Learning went even further in denouncing the Shinto of the Watarai Five Books. Teeuwen notes that Dazai Shundai (1680-1747) cited the appearance of the term shinto in the Yijing (Book of Changes) to argue that real Shinto is the Way of the ancient Chinese sages as embodied by the institutions of governance that have been correctly maintained since antiquity. In other words, there was no such thing as Japa- nese Shinto before Confucian learning and Confucian institutions were in- troduced to Japan. Dazai Shundai identified concepts such as mind-god, which had been so dear to Hayashi and Yamazaki, as none other than Bud- dhist teachings in Japanese disguise. He argued that contemporary Japanese Shinto forms of shrine worship and Shinto scholastic teachings, such as those found in the Five Books, originated as medieval Japanese corruptions of tantric Buddhism (mikkyo). For Dazai, the real Divine Way (shinto) is 364 24:2 (1998)</page><page sequence="5">Review Section governing the realm, while Buddhism merely teaches (unsuccessfully) how to govern one's own mind. Dazai, like Yoshimi Yukikazu, found that ordi- nary people should not worship the gods. The final rejection of Watarai teachings resulted from the new anti- Chinese interpretations of Shint6 advocated by Motoori Norinaga (1730- 1801) and other Nativist (kokugaku) scholars. These scholars rejected out of hand all works laced with Chinese and Buddhist terminology in favor of Japanese-language sources such as the imperial myths of the Kojiki and po- etry of the Man'yoshu. Teeuwen shows that while the leaders of the Watarai Shrine blindly clung to their own histories to justify their control of Ise pilgrimage income, the guides (onshi) who brought pilgrims to Ise increas- ingly studied under Nativist teachers, not only because it was more intellec- tually respectable but also to learn Japanese literature and poetry with which they could entertain their clients. Since the Meiji government nationalized both Ise Shrine complexes in 1871, the Watarai Shrine has been explained in Nativist terms as a subsidiary of the Kitai Shrine and as enshrining an obscure deity of food and abundant crops. Teeuwen concludes that the very same teachings of mind-god and pri- mordial chaos that accounted for the initial appeal of Watarai texts among Tokugawa intellectuals also led to their ultimate disrepute after academic fashions changed. So long as leading thinkers identified Shinto with self- cultivation, the Watarai Five Books could be interpreted as having universal applicability. But once Shinto came to be viewed solely in terms of the of- ficial rites of rulership, both the Five Books and the practice of Ise pilgrim- age by ordinary individuals became increasingly difficult to defend. So long as self-cultivation was more important than historical pedigree the Buddhist terms in the Watarai texts could be explained away as late interpolations within an ancient core. But once intellectual respectability demanded his- torical authenticity the Five Books and their mixture of Buddhist and Chi- nese concepts had to be rejected. In short, Teeuwen brings Tokugawa intel- lectual developments down to earth by viewing them through the lens of academic acceptance and rejection of the Five Books and thereby shows how seemingly abstract notions bore real economic and political conse- quences for the Ise institutions. Teeuwen's account of the origin and development of Watarai teachings prior to the Tokugawa period is more ambitious but less convincing. Diffi- culties in handling this material arise partly because, as Teeuwen himself asserts, Watarai teachings emerge in relationship to new economic demands and to changes in religious rituals. Neither of these topics can be easily explained merely in terms of intellectual history. This task is rendered even more challenging by the fact that medieval religion as a whole, and medieval shrine rites in particular, have not been well studied. Early Watarai devel- opments have been examined almost exclusively on the basis of the Five 365</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Japanese Studies Books, instead of in relationship to similar economic and religious devel- opments at other major shrines. Shinto scholars, on the one hand, are not interested in the development of popular worship, especially since it inevi- tably involves what they see as unseemly Buddhist elements. In studying Watarai Shinto they have tended either to focus on narrow questions of tex- tual dates and authorship or to advance dubious interpretations of Watarai texts as early examples of anti-Buddhist nationalist sentiments. Teeuwen wisely avoids both of these agendas. Buddhist scholars, on the other hand, generally regard Buddhist rites of shrine worship as base attempts at popu- larization that should be ignored in favor of sectarian hagiography and doc- trinal studies. Social historians, with a few notable exceptions, have not dared discuss topics ignored by scholars of religion. Thus, Teeuwen should be applauded for venturing into relatively uncharted areas. But because he rarely documents or explains the full significance of social and religious developments, too often his assertions raise as many questions as they answer. A case in point is Teeuwen's brief summary (pp. 21-24) of the landed estates of the Onakatomi, Arakida, and Watarai families. Teeuwen notes that changes in the estate system led to economic competition at Ise, but never explains exactly why nor how that competition directly relates to subse- quent religious developments. It is worth noting that because dominion over shrine estates includes the ordinary people (known as jinin) who worked there, these holdings demonstrate that Ise was never as removed from the life of ordinary people as the Heian law codes indicate. And intellectual developments at Ise were never as isolated from popular religious practices as Teeuwen's methodology assumes (p. 4). The closeness of Arakida and Watarai ties to these people can be seen in the fact that between 986 and 1086 on at least seven occasions Ise jinin, sometimes hundreds at once, marched into the capital to protest against actions at Ise by Onakatomi shrine officers.3 The number of such protests tapered off as Arakida and Watarai actively secured additional income estates, often in the newly claimed lands of eastern Japan where the warrior class would rise to power. Among the inhabitants of these newly claimed estates were members of collateral Arakida and Watarai lineages who assumed a local family name and functioned as junior celebrants (gonnegi) at new branch shrines (shin- meisha) and/or Buddhist chapels (e.g., dainichido) that they established. These worship halls were founded not so much "in order to spread popular faith" as Teeuwen asserts (p. 106), but because the produce from the estates was collected under the guise of offerings to the local shrine/chapel. Junior celebrants transported the local offerings (i.e., taxes) to the main shrine 3.

First, because Ise is located along the coastal route to Kumano, gonnegi traveling to Ise often found themselves in areas where Kumano yamabushi and Kumano pilgrim guides were already operating.5 While Ise personnel imitated many Kumano practices (especially pilgrimage), they also had to counter assertions of Ku- mano's superiority, such as the belief that Kumano is Ise's Innermost Sanc- tum (oku no miya; translated by Teeuwen, p. 144, as "out-lying sub- shrine"), and the widespread view that the god of Ise must be the Bodhisattva Kannon (Avalokitesvara), just like at Kumano.6 In order to gain access to new estates, Arakida and Watarai gonnegi had to convince the warriors who first cleared the land that the branch shrines they established would be affiliated to an institution of greater prominence (and thereby able to offer more spiritual protection) than Kumano or any other famous Bud- dhist temple. For this purpose they used the imperial title "K6tai" to em- phasize Ise's link to the court, which was highly desired by eastern warriors to enhance their prestige as members of the new rival ruling class. But this move generated friction between the two Ise complexes, because the eco- nomic foundations of the two complexes were split along family lines. Branch shrines supplied income only to the Ise complex where the local junior celebrant was affiliated.7 Thus, it was only a matter of time before the Watarai began to refer to their own shrine as "Imperial" and the Arakida would protest that the title belonged to their shrine alone. Yet because Teeu- wen never adequately explains the above points most readers will be at a loss to understand what he means when he writes,"there was some sort of exchange of religious information between the Watarai priests and yama- bushi" (p. 146), or "the character 'imperial' meant something special" (p. 72). 4.

Kawai (p. 82) provides the following example to illustrate this point. In 1130 Chiba Tsuneshige placed an estate under the protection of the Imperial Shrine through a gonnegi named Arakida Nobuaki. In 1143 that estate was seized by Mina- moto Yoshitomo who also concluded an arrangement with Arakida Nobuaki. After a few more changes in ownership, however, the estate ended up in the hands of Minamoto Yoshimune, who in 1161 split the estate in two, donating half to the Watarai Shrine through a gonnegi named Watarai Hikoakira. Meanwhile, however, Chiba Tsuneshige's son Tsunetane (1118- 1201) reasserted his family's claim to the entire estate and brought Arakida Nobuaki back to seize all its shrine income. In this way, armed conflicts over one estate by warrior bands occa- sioned the transfer of shrine income from the Arakida to the Watarai back to the Arakida. 367</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Japanese Studies In 1296 when the Arakida protested Watarai use of the imperial title, the Watarai defended their imperial status by citing precedents recorded in "twelve fascicles of secret documents stored at the Shrine" (jinzojunikan no hisho; translated by Teeuwen, p. 12, as "Twelve Divine and Secret Books") supposedly compiled in ancient times by Ise celebrants such as the Watarai ancestor Asuka (ca. 529) or Arakida Yukisada (ca. 942). (The actual dates of the texts remain uncertain, but most scholars peg them to the second half of the thirteenth century; see pp. 14-16.) Teeuwen's study of early Wa- tarai teachings focuses primarily on five of these works-the same texts singled out as Shinto's Five Books by Yamazaki Ansai's Suika school. Avoiding the anachronistic use of Yamazaki's designation, he refers to them as "the Secret Books," but the anachronism remains. Teeuwen evidently assumes that the centrality of these works is obvious, since he does not discuss alternative bibliographic sources. He merely cites a colophon to one of these texts, the Gochinza denki "in the Jingi Bunko manuscript," to extol their importance: In [this] colophon, moreover, the first three of these texts are singled out as the "Three Books of the Ise Shrines" (Jingu Sanbusho). The colophon states that these are the "ultimate" texts of the shrines, and that they are preserved in great secrecy in a special box in a divine storehouse on the Outer Shrine precincts. Scholars agree that this list was compiled by [Watarai] Yukitada in the year he turned sixty (1295). This is based on the fact that this year he copied all of the "Three Books," stating in his colophons that these works could not be shown to anyone under sixty years of age. (p. 13) While Teeuwen reports the content of the colophon accurately, the as- sertions he makes about scholarly consensus are unwarranted. The version of the Gochinza denki cited by Teeuwen, a recopy dated 1713, contains the only colophon found in any version of any of the early Watarai texts in the Shinto taikei edition (which includes colophons from several manuscript versions of each text) that identifies the texts in question as the Three Books or the "highest documents" (saijo no sho). And it is the only copy of any of the Secret Books that purports to be based on a 1295 copy by Watarai Yukitada, which it states he copied from an earlier 1191 manuscript. It says nothing about Yukitada having copied other texts, but lists (in an obvious fabrication) the same three titles as having been copied in 1185 by Watarai Takatsune. Moreover, the one copy of the Gochinza denki extant in Watarai Yukitada's own handwriting (the Shinfukuji manuscript) not only does not mention the term Three Books, but also does not include either of the 1295 or 1191 colophons quoted in this later 1713 version.8 In short, it is impos- sible to prove that Watarai Yukitada especially copied three of these texts in 8.

While no one can deny that the twelve fascicles, and the Five Books among them, played a crucial role in the attempt by the Watarai Shrine to assume the imperial title (that is, after all, the sole reason for which they were fabricated), early Watarai teachings were hardly limited to these com- pilations of pseudohistorical precedents. The fact that these works were kept secret, hidden even from members of the Watarai family lineage under 60 years of age, indicates that they were meant to be invoked as symbols of special privilege, not studied for religious teachings. But even had they not been kept secret, their unsystematic and often illogical entries, replete with obscure vocabulary and ungrammatical constructions, would have rendered them almost completely incomprehensible to people of average education, much less to Ise celebrants, most of whom apparently were unlettered.9 Moreover, as Teeuwen himself notes (p. 13, note 9), we have irrefutable evidence that Watarai Yukitada actually recommended other works. In his Koroku jitsuden (1299) Yukitada wrote: Among the hundreds of secret scrolls at the shrine the most ultimate ones, essential for spiritual benefits in this and the next life, are: Asuka ki, Daiso hifu, Yamato katsuragi hozan ki, section on gods, Shin no mihashira hiki, and Jinno jitsuroku. Just one reading of these five works will bring spiritual benefits in this and the next life. These are the illuminating discourse of the completely awakened [shogaku], completely wise [shochi], fundamental master [honshi] [i.e., the Buddha].10 A few lines later he added: All gods [ten, Sanskrit deva] regard the Bonmokyo [Brahma Net Sutra] as the ultimate teachings of the Three Jewels [of Buddhism]. One should read it. It causes one to think about inner realization [naisho, i.e., awakening] and outer functioning, about spiritual penetration [jinzu, i.e., miracles] and the Buddha Way, about eternal fundamental nothingness, about the compas- sion of shrine officiants, and about the supreme way of filial obedience [ko- jun]. All the gods who appear as manifest traces [of Buddhas] and all the 9. Hagiwara Tatsuo, in his detailed description of the textual characteristics of the Watarai texts, notes how they use Sanskrit terms, esoteric abbreviations, and obscure language to affect an air of mysterious profundity without ever actually attempting a systematic explanation of shrine rites or other religious ideas. See his Chusei saishi, pp. 528-31. Hagiwara (pp. 531-32) also points out that the low educational level of most Ise celebrants is mentioned in Ise daijingu sankei ki (a.k.a. Tsukai sankei ki) by the Buddhist monk Tsukai, who visited Ise for more than a year beginning in 1286 and who as the son of one Master of Rites (Onakatomi Takamichi, 1208-49) and as the brother of two others was very familiar with conditions at the Ise shrines. See Ise daijingu sankei ki (1287) in Zoku gunsho ruija (Tokyo: Zoku Gunsho Ruiju Kanseikai, 1902), Jingibu, vol. 1A, p. 939a. 10.

Making things great or small, existent or nonexistent, pure or defiled, good or evil, all are the doing of this One Mind. Of the titles recommended by Yukitada, only the Asuka ki (a.k.a. Gochinza hongi) is one of the Secret Books (or Five Books). The Brahma Net Sutra is the primary source for the bodhisattva precepts used to ordain Buddhist monks in Japan. It describes how Vairocana Buddha (a.k.a. Dainichi, the Buddha most often identified with Ise) sits in the center of the universe and chants the "precepts of purity" (shojo kai), which should be received single- mindedly (isshin) and observed with filial obedience. The other works also contain strong Buddhist overtones. Daiso hifu concerns Tendai-style tantric initiations. Yamato katsuragi hozan ki is a Shugend6 text about Mt. Katsu- ragi. Shin no mihashira hiki describes the cosmic axis. And Jinno jitsuroku is a compilation of Buddhist Ryobu Shinto initiations. We have every reason to believe that these works recommended by Yukitada were actually studied at Ise. From the account of the Ise Shrines in Shasekishu (1283), for ex- ample, we know that Ise celebrants prided themselves on their strict obser- vance of the Buddhist precepts listed in the Brahma Net Sutra. 2 The impor- tance of Buddhism in early Watarai teachings is also evident in the fact that Yukitada quotes extensively from a Ryobu text titled Tenchi reikaku hissho which he received in 1286 as part of an initiation from a Shingon teacher named Chinjui.'3 In focusing on the Secret Books, however, Teeuwen all but ignores Yu- kitada's list of recommended titles, discussing only one of them (the Yamato katsuragi hozan ki, pp. 143-46) and only briefly for the purpose of illus- trating Watarai influence on subsequent Ryobu Shinto developments. One can only speculate as to why Teeuwen presents early Watarai teachings through such an anachronistic paradigm. Perhaps it is because identifying early Watarai teachings with the Secret Books (a.k.a. Five Books) provides obvious continuity with his discussion of Tokugawa-period debates over the authenticity of the Five Books. Or, perhaps it is because he regards the fab- rication of pseudohistorical precedents as a major form of Watarai theology (p. 5). This reason alone, however, seems insufficient. Historical fabrication has a long and noble pedigree in Japan beginning with the royal family and extending to almost every other social group: aristocratic and warrior fami- 11. Ibid. 12.

While Watarai historical invention certainly is important on its own terms for understanding their political and economic concerns, it hardly dif- fers in kind from the falsification of origins endemic to premodern Japanese histories. Certainly its religious implications can be accurately ascertained only by considering them within the context of the full range of religious literature studied at Ise. Or, another reason is perhaps because of his facile definition of Shinto (adopted from Nelly Naumann) as the "beliefs formu- lated and expressed by the shrine priests" (p. 8). In other words, beliefs about gods formulated by Buddhists can be ignored. The problem with this definition of Shinto, of course, is that it begs the questions if scholars should distinguish between shrine ritualists and Bud- dhists, and, if so, how. These are significant issues for the study of medieval Japanese religions that cannot be resolved merely by pointing to institu- tional affiliation or familial lineage. The Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine, for example, was officially a Buddhist temple (Gokokuji) and the god Hachi- man was a bodhisattva. Likewise, the priests at the Hie Shrine sanctifying the Tendai Buddhist complex on Mt. Hiei were truly priests, which is to say, properly ordained members of the Buddhist clergy. The first Japanese to take an intellectual interest in defining the characteristics of the gods were Buddhist clerics. In medieval Japan Buddhas and gods, while governing different spheres, were seen as complementary manifestations of the same fundamentally Buddhist spiritual potency. In establishing branch Buddhist temples, therefore, itinerant monks often first built a shrine to the local god, enshrining him as the protector of the temple in order to legitimate their control over the land.14 In this way the propagation of Buddhism occasioned the institutionalization of Shint6 (to use the common designation) in remote areas. The fact that after the Watarai Shrine was destroyed by fire in 1486 it was not restored for more than 70 years until a Buddhist nun, Seijun, orga- nized a fund-raising drive on its behalf illustrates how crucial a role Bud- dhist clerics played in promoting shrine worship. Naturally, medieval shrine ritualists like all other members of society conceived of their own roles within a Buddhist cosmological framework. Even if they had wanted to pro- pose an alternative interpretation of the gods, the only philosophical lan- guage available to them was Buddhist.15 Ise was no exception. As Teeuwen mentions (pp. 49, 108), the Arakida, Onagatomi, and Watarai all supported multiple Buddhist temples where 14. See, for example, William M.

Elderly Ise Shrine celebrants cus- tomarily became ordained Buddhist monks to prepare themselves for death. These facts are important because they demonstrate that Ise officiants found soteriological solace only in Buddhism. It is not surprising, therefore, that they buried countless copies of Buddhist scriptures at Ise to prevent the Buddhist teachings from being lost.16 Members of the shrine families who could not inherit shrine positions often became Buddhist clerics. We know, for example, that Tstikai, a monk who wrote an account of his visit to Ise in 1286, was a member of the Onakatomi family. His father and two of his brothers served as Ise's Master of Rites (Teeuwen, p. 42, note 88). In 1367 the Watarai Secret Books were copied and edited by the Buddhist monk Gyoki, who gave his lay name as Watarai Sanemasa.'7 Teeuwen duly acknowledges how Buddhism permeated medieval Ise (pp. 48-49), but nonetheless writes as if being a shrine ritualist and being a practicing Buddhist were mutually exclusive: "[Although] ... obviously composed by a Buddhist ritual specialist, some of the information contained in the text is specific to the Ise tradition. This means that the Buddhist author must have consulted an Ise priest on Shinto matters that were obscure to him" (pp. 88-89; cf. p. 99, note 241). Given the fluidity with which shrine officiants could become ordained Buddhist clerics or Buddhist monks could disrobe to serve at shrines, attempts to draw such rigid distinctions between these two identities are meaningless. Even without formal rites of passage, moreover, the same person could participate in multiple social roles. Con- sider, for example, the case of Kitabatake Chikafusa, the author of the ex- tremely influential Jinnd shotoki (Chronicle of Gods and Sovereigns, 1339, revised 1343). Modern scholars rarely consider Kitabatake's Buddhist iden- tity. Yet in 1329 he was in fact ordained as a Buddhist monk. Significantly, from 1336 to 1338, he studied the Secret Books under the guidance of Wa- tarai Ieyuki (1256-1362) at Ise without his clerical status presenting any obstacles. 18 If Buddhism was so readily accepted at Ise during the medieval period, then one might rightly ask to what degree it is appropriate to call early Wa- tarai teachings "shinto." Because Teeuwen regards Shinto as an unproble- matic given, he never addresses this issue. The word shinto is, as noted by Dazai Shundai, of Chinese origin. In the Book of Changes it describes the invariability of the four seasons in a way that suggests the cosmic order of alternating yin and yang. But in Chinese literature it has other meanings as 16. Hagiwara, "Isejingui to Bukkyo," pp. 240-46. 17. Shinto taikei, Ise shinto, vol. 1, p. 48. 18. In 1345, two years after completing his Chronicle, Kitabatake wrote a short but de- tailed exposition of tantric praxis titled Shingon naishogi (Doctrine of Inner Realization by Spiritual Words), which he signed with his ordination name, Kakukii. There is no doubt, there- fore, that Kitabatake remained ordained throughout the entire period he was at Ise. 372 24:2 (1998)</page><page sequence="13">Review Section well. In the messianic Taiping jing (Canon of Great Peace) it is the will of the gods, and in the Taoist Baopu zi it refers to methods of immortality. Chinese Buddhists also wrote about shinto. In the writings of Sengzhao (ca. 384-414) it refers to the life force of transcendental truth, and Jicang (549-623) used it as a synonym for Buddhism. In Japan the Buddhist monk Dogen (1200-1253), who was almost contemporaneous with Watarai Yu- kitada, used the term shinto in a strictly Chinese Buddhist sense to refer to spiritual destinies (i.e., deva, asura, preta) within the six courses (rokudo) of rebirth. In Kitabatake's Chronicle, however, it implies order in a sense similar to that of the Book of Changes but with added political overtones of an invariable social hierarchy presided over by an unbroken succession of royal sovereigns. Knowing the extent to which Watarai teachings influenced Kitabatake's conception of shinto would help us gauge their larger cultural significance. Teeuwen (pp. 150-62) discusses at length Kitabatake's acceptance of the Watarai version of their own shrine's history without ever considering this larger conceptual issue. In the Secret Books themselves the term shinto hardly appears. When it does, it seems to be used as a synonym for gods (kami) in general, as in the following parallel construction: Shinto crosses the boundary of chaos to return to primordial chaos; the Three Jewels [of Buddhism] refute false views of eternalism and nihilism, to arrive at the stage of true reality. The gods [kami] punish the wicked, leading them to correctness; the Buddhas establish teachings, refuting thoughts of self existence.'9 In the Rujiju jingi hongen (Classified Account of the Source of the Gods, 1320) written by Kitabatake's teacher Watarai Ieyuki, however, the term shinto is used as a conceptual category within a Chinese cosmological framework. In fact, Ieyuki begins his compilation by quoting extensively from every conceivable commentary on the Book of Changes and on Chi- nese cosmogony, including recent Song-dynasty texts that had only just be- come available in Japan.20 The concept of shinto figures prominently in these quotations.21 The role of Song-dynasty Chinese metaphysics in giving voice to new articulations of Shinto in the writings of Ieyuki and Kitabatake underscores the importance of not limiting the study of medieval Watarai teachings just to the narrow range of topics found in the Secret Books. Yet, Teeuwen focuses on the Secret Books to substantiate his most stimulating conclusion. He interprets the purported oracle of Yamato-hime (traditionally dated 5 B.C.E.) recorded in three of the Secret Books as de- scribing a new conception of shrine worship in which ordinary people are 19.

Teeuwen argues that the Chinese Taoist terminology in various texts of the oracle should be seen as a rewriting of what were originally Buddhist rituals of mutual identification (kaji) with a deity as understood in terms of medieval Japanese notions of original awakening (hongaku homon). According to Teeuwen the oracle texts demonstrate that Ise celebrants pioneered the de- velopment of new rituals that transformed shrine worship from its original exclusive concern with royal succession alone into a spiritual practice ac- cessible to all Japanese (p. 392). Thus, he emphasizes the primacy of ritual practice over dogma: "Buddhist doctrine made its influence felt in Ise only after the priests had been engaged in Buddhist-like rituals for the purpose of private worship for some time" (p. 129). Teeuwen suggests that the Wa- tarai texts used Taoist language to distinguish themselves from and, thus, to better compete against rival practitioners of Ryobu Shinto and their Bud- dhist vocabulary (pp. 123-24). This novel interpretation of Ise worship highlights the importance of the study of ritual practices for any understanding of Japanese culture. Given its novelty, however, one can only wish that there had been sufficient room in Teeuwen's thesis for him to have provided more supporting evidence. Teeu- wen supplies only vague indications of how this mystical union was sup- posedly achieved in practice. Buddhist forms of mutual identification re- quire actual ritual techniques (giki, a.k.a. tantra) to enact a series of homologies that occur independent of any subjective mystical experience on the part of the practitioner. Is there any evidence that medieval pilgrims to Ise were guided through the performance of concrete homologies? If not, then exactly what did union with the deity entail? Teeuwen states that the Watarai understood the Taoist concept of attaining the One (de yi, Japanese tokuitsu; translated by Teeuwen as "attaining union") as indicating nothing less than unity with the Central Ruler of Heaven (Ame no minaka nushi), the god that they identified with their shrine (pp. 118-19). Is he suggesting that they saw the Central Ruler of Heaven as an anthropomorphic deity or personal savior? How do we know that they did not, in fact, understand this term in its Chinese sense of being in harmony with the Tao? Or, could they have understood it in a Buddhist sense as mental imperturbability? Mental imperturbability (isshin furan) is exactly how Watarai Ieyuki defines purity.22 Teeuwen provides no frame of reference for comparing or contrasting Watarai usage of these terms to their connotations in Chinese Buddhist and non-Buddhist literature. Works on similar motifs in Chinese thought (such 22. Ibid., p. 555. 374 24:2 (1998)</page><page sequence="15">Review Section as Norman Girardot's study of chaos in Chinese mythology) are conspicu- ous by their absence from Teeuwen's bibliography.23 Previous Japanese scholars of Watarai teachings have interpreted the oracle and its discourse on uprightness (shojiki), purity, and keeping "everything in its proper place" (p. 110) solely as an ethical teaching that served to reinforce feudal lord-vassal relationships.24 Certainly Kitabatake Chikafusa understood the oracle that way (pp. 158-59). Teeuwen's new interpretation would have been more convincing if he had explained why he found inadequate the interpretations of the oracle in terms of the feudal ethics emphasized by previous scholars. His presentation of the evidence also raises questions. For example, Teeuwen provides partial or full translations of three versions of the oracle (pp. 99-101, 111), but also asserts that it does not appear in a fourth text titled Gochinza hongi. In fact, a lengthy version of the oracle of Yamato- hime does appear in that text, but one that expresses different themes.25 Teeuwen translates a small portion of it (p. 116) but does not attribute it to Yamato-hime. In contrast to Teeuwen's exclusion of this different version of the oracle, Watarai Ieyuki included it in his Classified Account alongside the other versions of the oracle that Teeuwen does identify with Yamato-hime.26 Because Teeuwen never addresses bibliographic issues, the reader is left puzzled as to the basis for this difference. How would Teeuwen explain his new theory of mystical union in terms of the full text of this fourth version of the oracle? Also, Teeuwen asserts that, in contrast to the initial Japanese rejection of Buddhism, "nothing is known about any opposition to the in- troduction of Taoist ritual or deities [to Japan]" (pp. 121-22). This obser- vation is incorrect. The complete suppression of a Taoist religious cult in 644 is well known, as are the Bureau of Yin and Yang (On'yoryo) attempts to enforce a government monopoly on the performance of Taoist rites by prosecuting anyone found practicing Taoist magic.27 Teeuwen argues that the Shinto rituals of attaining union with the deity, which in his view originated with early Watarai oracles, enjoyed wide ap- peal over a long period. In this development Teeuwen finds a common thread running from Kamakura-period early Watarai teachings, through 23. Norman J.

Describing the connec- tion between early Watarai and later Confucian Shinto, Teeuwen says: "While there was a shift in terminology, the underlying structure of these Shinto schools remained the same" (p. 403). Thus, Teeuwen seems to imply that whether expressed in Buddhist, Taoist, or neo-Confucian terminology the fundamental religious experience of Shinto worship has remained re- markably similar. In this way Teeuwen attempts to chart a new middle way between, on the one hand, right-wing scholars who view Shinto rites of state and the emperor system as the ancient unchanging essence of Japan and, on the other hand, leftist scholars such as Kuroda Toshio who stress the radical degree to which the Meiji government created a new kind of Shinto different from what had existed previously (pp. 402-5).28 Teeuwen points to the con- tinuous physical presence of the Ise shrine complexes and, ergo, sees the existence of a continuous Shinto tradition as being self-evident (p. 7). Of course, any physical presence is only as meaningful as its relative position within the epistemological fabric of its age. Supporters of Kuroda's position might well point to the lack of more than 50 Arakida and Watarai Buddhist temples at Ise that were destroyed at the beginning of the Meiji period, or to the lack of more than 41 per cent of all village and ungraded Shinto shrines that the Japanese government destroyed between 1905 and 1929, and ask if the holes they left in the fabric of Japanese religious life are not equally obvious.29 Rather than arguing over the existence or lack of tra- dition, however, it might be more useful to redefine Ise tradition as (in the words of Pierre Bourdieu) a field of contestation, caught between popular religious sentiments and imperialist ideology, within which competing so- cial, political, and economic interest groups each have sought to fabricate their own pseudo-traditions.30 But I suspect that Teeuwen and Kuroda speak of two mutually exclusive conceptions of tradition. Teeuwen's study has fo- 28. Teeuwen specifically cites Kuroda's "Shinto in the History of Japanese Religion," translated by James C.

The beliefs and ideas of the masses of ordinary lay people were not at issue (p. 4). Kuroda, however, focused precisely on widely held systems of belief. The broader perspective of social history allowed Kuroda to assert that before the Meiji government began educating the masses any assertion of difference between the Buddhas and the local gods belonged, "in terms of social understanding, to the realm of hallucination." 31 In conclusion, Teeuwen's thesis is an ambitious work that makes a valu- able contribution to our understanding of Japanese religious and intellectual life. The sheer scale and scope of its accomplishment allows one to disagree on many points. But let there be no mistake, even scholars who wish he had considered different issues or who cannot fully accept each of his assertions will have to carefully consider his conclusions. The development of Shint6 is a topic that demands much more careful attention than it has heretofore been afforded by scholars inside and outside Japan.
