<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL FROM THE DEUTSCHES ARCHAOLOGISCHES INSTITUT AND THE BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT PATTERN ON LESBOS1 INTRODUCTION THE island of Lesbos in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age (henceforth EBA) is generally considered to have been an integral part of the north-west Anatolian material culture of coastal Troy I, but sharing its closest affinities with the Lydian ceramic zone of Balikesir, Akhisar-Manisa and the lower Gediz valley (FIG. i). Indeed, recent research has shown how 1 This paper derives from our regional studies in the north-east Aegean and western Anatolia. Funding was provided by the British Academy (in the form of a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship administered by the Academy and generously funded by Swan Hellenic/P&amp;O), the Wainwright Fund for Near Eastern Archaeology at Oxford (in the form of a Postdoctoral Reseach Fellowship), Worcester College Oxford, the Central Research Fund of London University, and the Greek government. We would also like to acknowledge the assistance of Mrs A. Archontidou-Argyri and Mrs L. Acheilara of the 20oth Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Mytilene who granted a permit to study the topography of the island and visit its ancient sites in 1990. In 1992 and 1993 permission was also given by the Ephoreia to study the prehistoric material on display in Mytilene museum and that kept in the museum's storerooms. Permission to publish material from the archives of the British School at Ath ns was kindly given by the Managing Committee in London, and permission to publish the sherds from the Deutsches Archaologisches Institut (DAI) in Athens was granted by Professor K. Fittschen. The assistance of Dr Martin Kreeb is also acknowledged for his help during the study of the sherds in the DAI in March-April 1995. Dr Makis Axiotis and Mr Miltis Paraskevaidis kindly discussed details of their extensive research in the island, and both scholars generously gave permission for details of this research (which have appeared in a number of books and as articles in the periodical AeOfltaxd and the archaeological magazine ApXaeotoytoa) to be discussed. We are also extremely grateful to the editor of Ap)Xatoloya (Dr Anna Lambraki) and the President of the 'Eratpeia r&amp;Cv Aeaftax&amp;v MeAer&amp;v (Mr Pavlos Vlachos) for permission to mention details of this important research. The authors would also like to thank Dr Christof Boehringer of the Gottingen Archaeological Institute for examining ceramic material in the Institute's archives on our behalf. Dr Lesley Beaumont (Assistant Director of the British School at Athens) gave important advice on the final form of the manuscript, and we owe a great debt also to Dr Chris Mee (the editor of the Annual) for his extreme patience and understanding. For comments on earlier drafts of this paper, thanks are due to Professor Jack Davis, Dr Donald Easton, Mr James Mellaart, Professor Gerald Schaus and the anonymous reviewers of the BSA Annual, whose advice and comments improved the text immeasurably.

In the whole area of the Lydian prehistoric pottery zone, only two sites have been satisfactorily excavated. The one is Thermi on the east coast of Lesbos (excavated by Winifred Lamb from 1929 to 1933) and the other is Gavurtepe/Alagehir to the south of Sardis and the Gediz valley.3 The partially excavated sites of Ahlatli Tepecik and Eski Bahkhane on the Marmara Golii north from Sardis also provide useful additional insights into the cultural complex to which EBA Lesbos belonged.4 in N.

Most workers today still treat prehistoric Lesbos in only very general terms, and tend to rely exclusively on evidence from Thermi in attempts at understanding the settlement of this whole island (which has an area of 1,630 km2 and is larger than any other Aegean island except Crete and Euboea). Indeed, since the 1930s, the chronology, material culture and ceramic sequence of this one site have been accepted as the whole story for prehistoric Lesbos.5 This paper aims primarily to publish evidence for the existence of other important prehistoric material on Lesbos. In doing so, it raises certain key questions with the aim of stimulating interest and provoking a more constructive line of thinking about the early colonization of the island and its dynamic relations with its neighbours. For example, was Thermi really the main settlement in Lesbos in the EBA? Were there sites earlier than Thermi on the island and is there any evidence at all for pre-EBA material on Lesbos? Did the first people really come from the Anatolian mainland directly to Thermi and begin to build the settlement immediately, as Lamb proposed?6 Or, was the process or colonization more gradual, more widespread and more diffuse? Furthermore, does EBA Lesbos have only coastal sites, or did settlement also develop inland? The evidence presented below provides a partial answer to some of these questions. For example, there are indications that a second nucleus of EBA settlement existed around the Gulf of Kalloni in the centre of the island, whose main source of influence may have come from further south, perhaps the island of Chios. Our initial look at the early settlement of Lesbos relies largely on a few sets of long-neglected sherds from eight different sites, now stored in the British School at Athens (henceforth BSA) and the Deutsches Archaologisches Institut in Athens (henceforth DAI), collected by several different explorers at different times during the early romantic days of archaeological exploration. THE PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF LESBOS Topographically, Lesbos consists of two large marine gulfs and three major physical regions (FIG. 2):7 the south-east plateau, including the Gulf of Yera and the Olimpos massif; the volcanic central highlands between the west coast of the Gulf of Kalloni and the north coast; and the hill country of pyroclastic rocks in the west. Most of the Holocene alluvial deposits are 5 A number of recent works all limit their discussion of settlement on the island to a review of the evidence from Thermi: for example, J.

The local sea-level curves from Dat1a/Old Knidos and Begik Bay/Troad both suggest that high sea-level equivalent to that of the present- day was first reached c. 6,ooo years ago when a marine transgression submerged many Aegean coastlines for the next I,ooo years, returning to lower levels again c. 5,000 years ago (i.e. roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age).'2 It may be suggested, therefore, that a period of one thousand years of submerged coastlines existed in the Aegean at the same time as the socio-cultural change from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age in the Aegean.'3 There can be little doubt that such environmental fluctuations would have affected the whole process of settlement all around the Aegean, including the colonization of Lesbos. Taking into account the physical geography of the island together with what is currently known of its archaeology, we would propose the following working hypothesis: that two main centres or 8 Ibid. 9 See T.

Furthermore, although coastal sites appear to represent the primary form of settlement, there is also evidence of many small, inland (often hilltop) sites, principally hamlets involved mainly with agriculture or animal husbandry (see TABLE I). On the east coast, Thermi looks across the Lesbos Channel towards several sites with similar material on the mainland coast at Altinova: Kaymaktepe/Yeni Yeldegirmentepe, Hiiyticektepe, Kazan Tepe, and Pandir Tepe (FIG. 3), from which it is separated by only 20 km of sea-water in the Lesbos Channel. The ceramic material of these sites exhibits striking similarities to that found at Thermi, suggesting that both Thermi on Lesbos and the sites on the mainland coastal plain at Altmova belong to the same process and period of colonization and settlement.'4 The second nucleus of settlement, the Gulf of Kalloni, is effectively cut off from the east coast by mountainous terrain and appears to be orientated south towards the island of Chios c. 50 km away (FIGS.

Evidence for this area is still primarily (but not exclusively) provided by Thermi, which we therefore re-examine in some detail first, before looking at other available evidence from the east coast. Then we examine the second centre of EBA settlement around the Gulf of Kalloni, finally ending with a synthesis and discussion of all the data presented. 15 For the material from Chios (and from sites to the south of Lesbos in Samos and Kalymnos) see 'Samos/ Kalimnos/Chios' and Emporio/Ayio Gala. 16 See Aegean Chronology, 74-7 for the summary of these links. 17 For Lamb's more simplistic view of a one-way colonization from the East towards Lesbos see n. 6 above, and for a fuller discussion of her diffusionist views see 'Lesbos and Altinova', 1o-17, 23-30; 'Communities in transition', 73.</page><page sequence="10">82 KYRIACOS LAMBRIANIDES AND NIGEL SPENCER THERMI AND THE EAST COAST OF LESBOS THERMI (FIG. 2) Thermi is located at sea-level on a promontory of the east coast, pointing directly across the Lesbos channel towards the coast of Altinova on the Anatolian mainland, where today the delta of the Madra (ay is located (FIG. 3).18 Similar promontory sites are found widely in the Aegean Final Neolithic and EBA, a well-known example being that at Kephala in Kea, which was spread across the slopes of a rocky cliff with a cemetery of cist or pit graves at its base next to a sandy beach.'19 Thermi lies beside a good natural harbour, today a small marina and holiday resort. It is located c. Io km north from Mytilene, on the seaward side of the present-day village of Pyrgoi Thermis. The mound of Thermi rises c. 6 m above sea-level (4 m of occupation material superimposed on 2 m of virgin soil), and it is likely that as much as a half of the area of the settlement may have been lost to the sea.20 The site forms part of a narrow strip of fertile, cultivated coastal plain which rises rapidly up into the hills to the west, from where several small streams supply the coastal plain with water. As Lamb observed, the first occupants had established themselves on the banks of two shallow streams where the subsoil was a stony clay with red topsoil resting on limestone.21 When it was occupied in antiquity this location clearly had access to fresh water, cultivable land, clay for pottery, marine resources and perhaps two good harbours, one on either side of the promontory. Excavated in 1928-33 by Winifred Lamb, Thermi represented the first serious attempt to investigate the prehistory of the island.22 Before her involvement, Newton,23 Conze,24 Koldewey,25 and Evangelidis26 had all concentrated upon the remains of Iron Age Lesbos. In contrast to these earlier scholars, however, Lamb had come to the island with the main objective of finding and examining in detail a site 'which would throw light on its [Lesbos'] early culture and provide a link between Greece and Anatolia'.27 It was this purpose which, after trial excavations at Methymna and Antissa, led to the concentration upon Thermi, a site clearly dating from a much earlier period than nearly all the material from the two other sites.28 The 4 m of cultural deposits at Thermi comprised five major architectural phases (Towns I-V),29 a sequence correlated by Lamb with three ceramic periods:30 '8 See the reports on the fieldwork under the direction of the present authors in the Madra Gay delta at Altinova (n.

Pattern-burnished sherd amongst the Thermi material in Mytilene Museum depot. Redrawn from Kastro Tigani, pl. 89. I (exact scale not given in the publication). Class A Towns I and II (the earliest architectural phases) contained only pottery defined as 'Class A' by Lamb (black and red wares),31 which in terms of the range of shapes find their closest parallels with Troy 132 and Yortan 'A'.33 On the basis of ceramic synchronizations with these and other sites, the relative chronology of Thermi I-II has been correlated with late Troy I, Beycesultan EB 2 (XVI-XV) and Demircihiiyiik EB 2 (phases L-N), with an absolute date of c. 2700-2600BC.34 This relative dating is contradicted, however, by three recently published radio-carbon dates (all from charcoal): for Town I, c. 2910-2780 BC (calibrated);35 an earlier date of 3022-2700 BC (calibrated), obtained from a sample taken from the lowest excavated floor (2.45 m above sea-level);36 and a third sample, taken from 1.75 m above sea-level which gave 3943-3195 BC (calibrated), rejected as being too early.37 A sherd with pattern burnish on the inside (FIG. 4) found among the Thermi material in the museum depot at Mytilene does not fit into the accepted chronology of Thermi and was rejected as too early to have come from this site. Instead, it was proposed to have originated from the site of Chalakies on the Gulf of Kalloni (see below).38 However, this issue is rather more complicated. As observed by several workers, pattern-burnished decoration is widespread around the Aegean and Western Anatolia39 but it is rare in the ceramic zone of Lesbos-Altmova and the Bakir gay valley.40 The technique is relatively common to the north 31 Ibid., 73-8 and figs. 26-7. 32 Troy I, figs. 223 a-267 passim. 33 Yortan, pls III-XV, figs. 23-76. 34 See Demircihiiyiik III, 2, fig. 98; D.

The few pieces that have been found in the region of Lesbos and Altmnova may therefore have been either imports or sporadic local attempts to imitate an 'exotic' technique. An important aspect of Thermi, which also bears on the chronology, is that Towns I and II have provided some of the earliest metal objects of the Aegean EBA.43 One of the most significant is a crucible found 'below the lowest floor level and almost on virgin soil'.44 It has a spout at right angles to the handle and 'an appearance of slag ... through constant use'.45 A second crucible with traces of slag was found in Town I with a projecting knob possibly for a wooden handle.46 The processing of metal thus began very early at this site, perhaps even before a permanent settlement was established here. If this is true, such activity may even have stimulated the establishment and growth of a settlement at Thermi-a point that can only be investigated further by systematic new excavations down to virgin soil in the area of the site wisely left unexcavated by Lamb.47 The Cycladic site of Kephala on Kea provides an interesting parallel, since smelting began equally early at this promontory site of the pre- Trojan west Aegean,48 although it has been suggested recently from analysis of the metal data that contact between Lesbians and Aegean metal traders was rare at the beginning of the third millennium BC (i.e. during the life of Towns I-II).49 A handful of figurines was recovered also from the earliest architectural phases of Thermi I-II, all in stone or marble, and all with a striking resemblance to the Early Cycladic idols of the Grotta-Pelos culture.50 Both Lamb51 and Bittel52 proposed a Cycladic origin for these figurines, and Lamb was in little doubt that the marble bowls from Towns I-II (and from early III) were also imports from the Cyclades.53 The rarity both of marble bowls and figurines at Thermi tends to support the view that the very few found at the site came here as imported objects.54 41 Seeher, 'Prahistorische Funde', (n. 2); it is also much in evidence at Kum Tepe in the Troad, 'Kum Tepe', passim. 42 'Samos/Kalimnos/Chios', 187, 205-8 and fig. 6 nos. 67-8, 71-2 and fig. 15, pl.

The provenance is unknown and the object has since disappeared, but its presence on Lesbos may be an additional indication that the island was indeed a member of the north-west Anatolian LCH culture complex during the period of the 'BeAik-Sivritepe-Kum Tepe Ia-Emporio X-VIII' horizon, as argued byJ.

At this time the style of figurine changes radically and a new, more naturalistic series of shapes in clay appears in great numbers, replacing the handful of stone or marble idols of Towns I-II.56 Accompanying these changes are broader shifts in other aspects of material culture, such as the appearance of bothroi at the site and the construction of an internal ramp.57 The radical change from stone to terracotta idols in Town III corresponds to the equally radical change in shape from schematic representations to a more anthropomorphic emphasis, and by a sharp increase in the numbers of idols recovered from Town III upwards (more than one hundred are reported by Lamb).58 The variety of new shapes of terracotta idols also suggests that there was a change in the way women were now being conceptualized and represented at Thermi, which may reflect fundamental social changes at the settlement, compared to the previous phases. The new, more naturalistic female forms have very few parallels elsewhere. Only the idols discovered at EBA Demircihtiyik suggest any real affinities,59 although Balkan influences have been proposed to explain the preference for clay and the use of large numbers of idols.60 The evidence of metal finds also suggests that major social and cultural changes were taking place at Thermi during the transition from Towns I-II to Towns III-IV. Begemann recently observed that 'the artefacts from Thermi I-II are clearly set apart from those of the later Towns by the contents of some of their trace elements'.6' Begemann's team found a very good correlation between trace element signature and occupational level at Thermi. This enabled them to propose first, that contact between Lesbos and the rest of the Aegean was rare at the beginning of the third millennium (in terms of metal). Second, that there was a change in metal composition which was in step with occupational level, and that this change was due to the change in the source of the metal. And third, that from Town III onwards the sources of metal found at Thermi had changed by comparison with the earlier phases, indicating that important changes may have taken place in the settlement's external relations at this time.62 Class C Towns IVb and V have only Class C pottery, the brown and grey-brown wares which appear for the first time in the uppermost levels.63 Lamb considered this new ware 'more complicated, for the Thermi pots, though resembling in many ways those belonging to the earlier stages of Troy II (Troy IIa), are more independent than their forerunners'.64 The ceramic changes witnessed in these later phases of Thermi were related by Lamb to the loosening of ties with the Anatolian mainland and what she believed to be increasing relations with Macedonia and the Aegean, reflected in material evidence such as one fragment of a 5 Thermi, fig. 28. 56 Ibid., 150-6, I77, pls.

MYTILENE (KASTRO) (FIG. 2) The earliest traces of settlement activity within the area of the modern town of Mytilene (also the site of the classical city) are reported to be EBA sherds found during the construction of the new museum in 1990.68 This report is supported by two EBA sherds from 'Mytilini, Kastro' in the DAI. The site of the new museum lies close to the south-west of the kastro on what today is a promontory jutting out eastwards into the Lesbos Channel. In antiquity this promontory was a small island separated from the rest of Lesbos by a narrow channel running north-south (along the line of the present-day main street, Odos Ermou).69 This topographical feature would have meant that in antiquity the narrow channel between the island and the mainland would have offered two sheltered harbours immediately to the north and south for those dwelling on the island above. Of the two sherds illustrated, 33 is the fragment of a typical incurved rim bowl as found in Thermi Class A and B and at practically every other site of this period in Lesbos (FIG. 5). 34 is a wall and rim fragment of a reddish/black coarse ware jar with a protruding knob on its shoulder instead of a handle (FIGS. 5-6). This idea of using a knob instead of a handle was adopted at many other sites along the Aegean coast of Anatolia from the time of Emporio X-VIII,70 continued in use until at least Emporio III-II,71 and generally in EB 2-3a levels at 65 Ibid., fig. 32. 521.

The majority of the sites included in the list represent unsubstantiated or uninvestigated reports, but three sites are worthy of individual mention here. The first, Agios Bartholomaios (see FIG. 2), is particularly worthy of close attention as a selection of whole pots now on public display in Mytilene Museum suggests an EBA chronology and parallels with the Anatolian mainland. Several of these pots are also illustrated in the Archaiologikon Deltion of I960.76 These illustrations are interesting because of the thirteen whole pots which they show: eleven are handled jugs or cups, one is a globular jar, and one is a simple shallow bowl, all of which are consistent with the mainland Western Anatolian EBA C34 C33 FIG. 5.

Gazetteer, io (site 35)-</page><page sequence="16">88 KYRIACOS LAMBRIANIDES AND NIGEL SPENCER The large number of complete vessels led Charitonidis to suggest the use of the cave for burial,78 whilst Kontis and Axiotis both thought the lack of skeletal remains suggested instead that the site was used as a shelter by shepherds.79 The seasonal use of caves and other forms of shelter by farmers and pastoralists travelling far from their permanent home is a common fact of life in Aegean lands, so a similar use of this site by pastoralists coming from other parts of Lesbos or from across the sea is entirely plausible.80 However, there is no positive evidence at present to suggest that the use of such seasonal shelters necessarily pre-dated or was a precursor of permanent settlements on prehistoric Lesbos. The material at this cave site can provide badly needed insights into the process of settlement development on Lesbos. In the Western Anatolian EBA, it is well-known that jugs and cups form a prominent component of the ceramic repertoire. Examples of 'miniature jugs'81 (or 'jugs/tankards'82) can be seen at Tigani on Samos,83 on Chios both in the lower cave at Agio Gala84 and at Emporio VII-VI,85 and similar shapes are also found in the earliest phases of Thermi.86 Jugs with a horizontal straight spout are found at Tigani IVB,87 as surface finds in the Bakir Qay valley88 and also at Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic (henceforth LCH) levels I-4.89Jugs with a straight spout are infrequent at Thermi, where obliquely spouted examples are more 78 Charitonidis, ibid. 79 Kontis, 210; Perpatontas, 89 and pl. ii. 80 Transhumant pastoralism has long been seen as implicated in the process of cultural diffusion; for instance, A.

Simple bowls are a fundamental part of the repertoire of this period.96 Some bowls with slightly flaring rims may be seen at Tigani IV,97 and in the upper Maeander valley at Beycesultan LCH 2,98 but also some straight-sided ones occur at Thermi.99 Amphoroid cooking pots are widespread, occurring from early/mid-Troy I10o and in Lamb's Class C at Thermi,o0' which exhibit vertical loop handles just below the rim. Interestingly, such amphoroid cooking pots are reminiscent of the 'wide-mouthed bowl-like jars' from the lower cave at Agio Gala'02 from which they may be descended. Bowl-jars with undifferentiated necks were characteristic of the early levels at Emporio (X-VI)'03 and, as Hood noted, were standard at Hacilar Late Neolithic IX-VI, yet they remained current at Emporio into the EBA.104 They are similar to jar shapes found widely at LCH sites in the east Aegean, including Kalythies on Rhodes, Leros, and Alimnia, as well as at Beycesultan.'05 The second site worthy of special note here is known as Plati (Site 2 in TABLE I). According to an article in a Greek archaeological magazine (also to be found in the BSA library),106 sherds seen on the surface here suggest close parallels with Thermi and Troy I (e.g. inverted rimslo'7). The same report suggests that this site was an early agricultural site of relatively small (hamlet) size, offering the added advantage of easy defence, lying on a natural acropolis with only one path of approach.108 The third site, Angourelia Sarakinas (Site 25 in TABLE I), is also located on a hilltop not far from the east coast (near modern Mandamados).109 According to the illustrations provided for finds at the site,110 EBA sherds (including pithoi and tubular 90 Thermi, figs. 26, 28-9; see also the jugs in the earliest EBA levels at Demircihioytik which all exhibit spouts; Demircihiiyiik III, I, 127 (forms 1-2) and pls. 30. 9-14, 32. 10-12 and 37-40. 91 'Kum Tepe', pl. 78. 92 See Emporio/Ayio Gala, figs.

The impression gained from the combined evidence from all these sites on the east coast is that the EBA pottery of Lesbos may have a longer local development on the island than has hitherto been accepted. For example, at least some of the jugs found on the east coast may be somewhat earlier than the well-known repertoire from Thermi"'l thus pushing back in time the settlement chronology of Lesbos to the period of Tigani IV, Beycesultan LC 2-4, Kum Tepe IB and Emporio VII/VI. SITES AROUND THE GULF OF KALLONI A surprisingly large number of sites has been reported from the general area of the Gulf of Kalloni and the centre of the island (see TABLE I). We now discuss those for which there is substantiated evidence. CHALAKIES (POLICHNITOS) (FIG. 2) Nine sherds relating to the site of Chalakies were found in the DAI and BSA depots (see Catalogue x-9 and FIGS. 7-io). Chalakies is located on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Kalloni, in the centre of the island, over 30 km from Thermi and the east coast as the crow flies."12 In terms of a prehistoric person's journey-time over the rugged mountainous terrain this could take one to two days. In I960, Charitonidis (the Ephor of Antiquities on Lesbos) described Chalakies as a 'tongue-like spit' projecting out into the sea, in form characteristic of promontory sites with its own natural harbour, and near to the marine corridor which leads out to the open sea and south towards Chios."113 As with Thermi, the promontory on which the site is located has been subject to erosion by the sea over many thousands of years, leaving only the exposed cliff-face (c. 5 m high) for further archaeological study. The material seen here by Charitonidis belonged primarily to the EBA, but 'possibly also dating from the end of the Neolithic period, with sherds closely related to Agio Gala on Chios'.114 In our catalogue, all the sherds found in the depots from this site (1-8) could well belong to the EBA on the basis of stylistic criteria, except perhaps 9 which exhibits certain characteristics of earlier material. i (an inverted rim) and 2 (quite sharply incurved rim) are reminiscent in fabric and shape of Thermi Class A bowls, suggesting that Chalakies is contemporary with early Thermi."5 Both sherds may well once have exhibited burnishing, but the continual washing of the sea has left only a smooth surface. 3, another bowl rim, does have "I Thermi Class A: Thermi, fig. 26 Jugs 1-9. Note the subsequent development of jugs in Classes B and C, ibid. figs. 28-9. 112 See Gazetteer, 18 (site 84) for full details of the location. For reports on the site see S.

The closest parallels to this form (although in a coarser fabric) appear to be with the tripod cup 2 of Thermi A." It is difficult to be at all certain about 6 and 7. The fabric appears lighter than those described so far and the shape of 6 suggests a slightly flared or everted rim of a bowl. Thus both in fabric and form one may speculate that they are earlier than the other material. Both pieces may have affinities with the red/light burnished fabrics found in Emporio X-VI, but this is far from certain.119 9 is a vertically pierced lug-handle which may come from the wall (possibly including the rim) of an open fine ware vessel (FIGS. 7, io). The sherd is of fine clay with an extremely smooth (probably originally burnished) surface, although any trace of burnishing has been worn away by the action of the sea. The rounded edges of the sherd also make it difficult to tell whether the handle is located on the rim (and rises above it), or whether it is lower down on the wall of the vessel. The closest parallels for the form of the lug all suggest that it is indeed a handle which rises above the rim, reminiscent of pre-Thermi material,120 although 17 Similar shapes are apparent at the Upper Cave of Ayio Gala: Emporio/Ayio Gala, no. 274 (p. 58; gritty light-brown, traces of burnish) and fig. 41.274 (from the Upper Levels of the cave).

It is worth repeating here (as noted on p. 89) that amphoroid jars have a long history in Western Anatolia, first appearing in the Early Neolithic of Qgatal Huytik. By the time of Emporio X-VI, this shape had developed into the Type 41 jar, with differentiated neck, especially common in level VIII'23 and it appears to develop into the Type 43 jar of levels V-II.124 At Thermi this form is found in the more elaborate (and later) Class C forms of the 'amphoroid jar' and the 'winged jar'.'25 KOURTIR (LISVORI) (FIG. 2) Located only c. 7 km further north along the same coastline is another example of a promontory site at the location known as Kourtir or Skamnioudi (the small skala of Lisvori). The site lies on a tongue-like spit of land with its own natural harbour, and it is from this topographical setting that the site is said to have taken its name (AxpWT'jpt = Kourtir).'26 Kourtir has been described as (potentially) one of the two or three most important prehistoric sites on Lesbos,127 one estimate suggesting that it may be five times greater in area than Thermi.'28 Like Chalakies and Thermi, the promontory on which this site is located has been subject to erosion by the sea over several thousand years.

Sherds were picked out from different parts of the scarp, the majority of which were of Early Bronze Age date, similar to those from Thermi, a few are definitely Late Neolithic, and a fair number are of the Middle Bronze Age. From all over the ground [above], which is intensively cultivated, were picked up a mass of Middle and Late Bronze Age Lesbian red and grey wares, but also a large number of imported Mycenaean sherds.134 Three trial trenches by Chatzi'35 uncovered wall and house remains, masses of prehistoric ceramics, and a human skeleton.'36 All the finds from the 1970 and 1972 investigations were stored in the depot at the Mytilene museum and still await publication by the original excavator.137 Only three sherds have been found in the school depots in Athens marked 'Skamnioudi', the skala/port which adjoins the promontory at Kourtir (see above) (Catalogue nos. 10-12). One of these pieces (io) is a highly burnished black fineware fabric which exhibits surface striations (on the outside) due to polishing (FIG. ii). The fabric and treatment of the sherd is reminiscent of the fabrics of the Middle to Late Chalcolithic horizon described by Seeher as the 'Begik-Sivritepe-Gilpinar-Kum Tepe IA','38 and one is tempted to propose a date in the LCH.'39 A second piece (ii) in red-brown burnished handmade fabric is an incurved rim more typical of Thermi Class A. Also here (12) is a decorated body sherd strongly reminiscent of Mycenaean fabrics and surface treatment.140 In a book to be found in the BSA library,141 there is a report with illustrations of several 130 By S.

Paraskevaidis reports (ibid.) that two of the trenches were in the plot of Yiannoglou near the shore, and a third was opened actually in the exposed scarp on the north side of the site. This brief excavation (without any detailed comment) is also referred to in Kontis, 360. 136 Paraskevaidis, loc. cit., 13I. It is unclear in the summary description provided from exactly which stratum of the site the skeleton came, but its presence within the area of settlement is noteworthy.

The most striking shapes described by the author are: a high loop handle from a low cup or shallow bowl; a globular jug with a rising spout; and an unusual shallow bowl or scoop with internal handle.142 Two of these pieces are among the most common and long-lived shapes found in the north- west Anatolian EBA ceramic repertoire. The low cup or shallow bowl with high loop handle143 appears (without any plastic decoration) in the Black (pre-Troy) phase at Poliochni'44 and Emporio V-IV145 but seems to have become more common in the time of late Troy II to V1146 continuing into the Middle Bronze Age.'47 The line drawing by the author of a whole jug with a rising spout and globular body'48 resembles a similar whole jug on display in Mytilene Museum,149 reminiscent in form of jugs from all phases at Thermi5so and Emporio II-I.151 142 Paraskevaidis (n. 126), unnumbered photographs pp. 263-64; Perpatontas, pl. 126.

It lies at the north-west edge of the village of Agia Paraskevi where the church of the same name and the village cemetery lie at the foot of the small hill on which stands an old chapel of Profitis Ilias. Kiepert first visited the hill in 1841 and both he and Koldewey stated that there were sherds and tiles on the hill which were not modern.154 In 1975 M. Paraskevaidis and B. Kalaitzis returned to the site, finding a large number of EBA sherds (in addition to Middle Bronze Age and Late Bronze Age pieces) which were subsequently published in the periodical Aeoftaxd.'55 Axiotis added more detail recently, stating that the EBA material was especially dense on the east slope (facing the village) and also that there were house foundations eroding out of the slopes in association with the EBA sherds.'56 In the BSA collection there are a number of diagnostic pieces too. The catalogue of sherds (13-27) suggests a ceramic assemblage very similar to that of Thermi. The small sample of pieces (fifteen sherds) and the absence of stratigraphical details precludes any such fine sub-divisions as have been established for Thermi. It is possible, however, to point to at least two fragments with a sharply inverted rim (x5, 20) (FIG. I2) which have parallels in Thermi Class A.'57 The detailed article in Aeo/ltaXd158 (also to be found in the BSA library) illustrates further examples of incurved rim bowls and other typical EBA shapes at this site.159 Sherd 13 in the Catalogue is a typical EBA horizontally-pierced tubular lug on an incurving rim bowl (FIG. 13), also found frequently at Thermi, particularly in the Class A wares.160 The fabric is, unusually perhaps, a rather coarse unburnished brown ware, whereas at Thermi this shape most frequently occurs in a black/dark-brown burnished ware.161 Horizontally pierced 152 Paraskevaidis (n. 126) unnumbered photograph p. 263- The fabric of which is unclear from the only published photograph. 153 Emporio I: Emporio/Ayio Gala, no. 2503 (p. 552; grey- brown, partly burnished) fig. 245. 2503 and pl. 95; Troy IIf: Troy I (shape A 27) no. 36. 855 (p. 306; a red slipped and polished example), figs 370 a, 379- 36. 855; Beycesultan VI a: Beycesultan, fig.

The finds from Hashuiyiik are said to be of 'Copper Age' date, Ciramiques monochromes, vol. 2, table 33 (type A2. 124), but there seems little in Delaporte's report (pp. 230-3) to verify this chronological conclusion. All these examples of internal handles are on bowls which exhibit a much less pronounced incurved rim than is apparent on the bowl from Kourtir. The latter profile is most closely paralleled at Aharkoy (north from Demircihiyiik), see Demircihiiyiik III, 2, 163 and pl. 63. 4, dated to EBA 2b/3a (although in this case both ends of the handle are attached to the rim rather than one being placed inside the bowl).

In terms of fabric, however, the foot at Profitis Ilias could also belong to the later Class C wares at Thermi to which it also shows similarities.173 There are several handles from large vessels (18-19, 23), possibly from amphoroid pots similar to those at Thermi.'74 The piece from a loop handle with round section (21 could well belong to a jug, and another loop handle with round section and preserved burnishing (26) is typical of the jugs found in all phases at Thermi'75 but also as late as Emporio I.176 Such a handle could even be from a two-handled depas, a shape which appears in the levels of Troy IId-III, Poliochni Yellow, Heraion I, Protesilas IV, and Emporio I and recently has been found at Palamari on Skyros.'77 A similar loop handle is illustrated by Paraskevaidis as being from the site,178 and another jug wall and handle'79 has apparent affinities to Tigani IV on Samos.180 25 appears to be the base of a handle with oval section and may also belong to a large jar. Decoration is rare in the EBA of Lesbos and for this reason two pieces from the site are of particular interest. Plastic ornament in the form of warts or knobs appears on the wall of a large pot,181 a feature paralleled elsewhere on Lesbos at Thermi and Eresos,182 in Chios at Emporio,183 and on the Anatolian mainland.'84 Also, a sherd with incised, '73 Thermi, fig. 29 tripod cooking pots 1-2.

The form of the piece, however, is that of a vertically pierced tab handle similar to many black or dark-burnished handles in Class A ware of Thermi.'87 This somewhat unusual combination of fabric, decoration, and form finds some of its closest affinities in the earlier levels of Emporio X-VI and Tigani I-III and may be an import from Chios,'88 where light-coloured fabrics probably do descend from the Early Chalcolithic wares of Agio Gala Lower Cave.189 In summary, the main affinities of this site appear to be principally with Thermi Classes A- B, but without further research it is not possible to determine its exact chronological relationship with the latter site. Importantly, however, Profitis Ilias does demonstrate the existence of an alternative EBA settlement-type on Lesbos quite distinct from the now familiar coastal sites both on the east coast and around the Gulf of Kalloni. MAKARA (AGRA) (FIG. 2) Around the small coastal plain of Makara at the west mouth of the Gulf of Kalloni, a whole series of remains indicates significant human activity from the EBA.'19 The site is of great interest, given its location at the entrance to the gulf and its potential for overseas relations, particularly with the island of Chios to the south. Sherds from this site in the BSA (catalogued here) were identified by French as being of Troy I date,9"' but it is not clear from exactly which part of the (quite extensive) area of ancient remains in the valley the sherds were collected.192 The fabric, shape, and treatment of these sherds (28-32) leave little doubt that they belong to the same period as Thermi Classes A and B. 31 is a fragment of black-burnished and sharply inverted bowl rim typical of the earliest phases at Thermi. In form, the rim with a very thick, horizontally pierced lug handle spanning the incurved rim, resembling a nose with eyes (29; FIGS. 15-16), is reminiscent of Thermi bowls of Classes A and B,'93 Kum Tepe IB,194 185 Thermi, 79-82 and pl.

The highly burnished rim fragment (28; FIGS 15-16) also seems to belong to an incurved rim bowl, and the unusually narrow handle attachment is a cross between a lug proper and a jug handle, most closely paralleled at Hacirahmanli (a sherd dated to the Kum Tepe IB phase by French) in the plain of Akhisar-Manisa.200 30 is reminiscent of the cooking-pot feet discussed above for Chalakies (4) and confirms the ubiquity of this basic form in the north-east Aegean area.201 32 is a simple straight-sided rim which may be from a simple bowl or other straight-walled pot. It is difficult to define the vessel to which it might belong with any certainty. The fabric, however, is typical of the grey/buff (often burnished) handmade pieces found at this site. Another noteworthy feature at Makara (originally reported by Charitonidis) is a group of three large cist graves on the bay's south-east arm (known as 'Koukkos').202 The tombs are still visible '~ The thick lug handles from Tigani IV are similar, both in fabric and form: see Kastro Tigani, no 434 (P. 191; brown ware, polished), pls. 41. 4 and 74. 434, no. 438 (p. 192; light red-brown, mottled black, polished), pls. 41. 4 and 71. 438.

Charitonidis described the cists as 'Mycenaean', citing similar burials on the island of Psara and at Eleusis.203 Since the graves here are empty, however, making it impossible to date them accurately, it is possible that there may be links between these cist tombs and the Early Cycladic cists on Keos, Naxos, Paros, and many other Aegean islands, where this is the principal form of burial.204 Two points to remember, however, are that the BSA archives do not specify the precise location of the EBA sherds from Makara; and that the dating of these tombs to the 'Mycenaean' period is based purely on the architectural style since no other finds of such a date have ever been reported at Makara.205 PALAIOKASTRO (ARISBE) (FIG. 2) Leaving the village of Arisbe near Kalloni on the main road towards Mytilene, after c. 150 m a track leaves the road to the left (as the road bends sharply right) and heads north to the low rocky hill 40 m above sea level which forms the acropolis of ancient Arisbe or Palaiokastro. The earliest traces of habitation activity on the acropolis are the EBA and Middle Bronze Age sherds found in a surface inspection initially by S. Paraskevaidis,206 and subsequently by Bayne and during Chatzi's excavations in 1972.207 Amongst the sherds illustrated by Chatzi there appear to be narrow cooking-pot feet and possibly also a knob similar to that examined above on the sherd from the Kastro in Mytilene.208 Three sherds in the BSA archive, first identified as 'Troy I' by David French in 1968,209 are presented here as further evidence of the site's involvement in the EBA settlement pattern in the island. 35 (FIG. 17) is an incurved rim bowl fragment in a brown burnished fabric perhaps most reminiscent of Thermi Class B ware.210 The body sherd (36) is also a piece of EBA handmade burnished brown ware, as French proposed, but otherwise is of little diagnostic value. 37, a 35 37 FIG. 17.

However, given its commanding location overlooking the central plain and the main route crossing the island, it is a prehistoric site which cannot be ignored.215 It is, moreover, very close to the other very important site of Profitis Ilias near Agia Paraskevi (see above) with which it appears to have formed a nucleus or group of related sites in the EBA. OTHER REPORTED PREHISTORIC SITES OF THE CENTRAL REGION Four other sites listed in TABLE I are worthy of individual mention here. Agios Fokas (see TABLE I and FIG. 2), a coastal site described by Chatzi in 1972 as located on a narrow promontory 20 m above sea-level, 4.5 km south-south-west from Vrisa, has traces of EBA cultural material on both the downward slope below the small chapel and along its south cape.216 In a trial excavation Chatzi found more EBA material together with Archaic and Classical sherds.217 The topography here is typical of coastal promontory sites, very much like Thermi, Chalakies, and Kourtir.218 Further 2" Thermi, miniature vase pl.

Pithoi containing human bones have been reported from the site of Mitoilia 20 km east of Agios Fokas near the south coast of the island (see TABLE I and FIG. 2).219 Associated ceramics included pieces of coarse red pithos, the beaked neck-fragment of a jug with cutaway spout typical of Thermi Class A and Yortan Class A,220 and a black ware lid and base with feet.221 If the reports of this site are reliable, it will be only the second site after Thermi itself where EBA pithos burials have been discovered so far on Lesbos.222 On the east side of the Gulf of Kalloni, c. I km south-south-west from the modern village of Lisvori, a dense pottery scatter covers the twin-peaked hill of Damandri 170 m above sea level (see TABLE I and FIG. 2). Charitonidis compared the material found here to that at Chalakies and Kourtir, noting that it was part of a small nucleus of settlements here on the gulf, and described a particularly heavy concentration on the saddle between the two peaks.223 He also compared its hilltop location to the site of Palaiokastro (Arisbe).224 Axiotis reported much material also on the terraces of the west slope.225 In addition to EBA ceramics, the debris of lithic production (including stone flakes and broken blades) was visible together with shell middens and trachyte millstones.226 The location of the Damandri hill immediately above the modern Vasilika-Polichnitos highway c. 4 km south from Kourtir and 6 km east from Chalakies (FIG. 2) straddles a number of important communication routes at the innermost edge of the coastal plain, suggesting that there may well have been contact with the sites on the coast. At the location known as Klopedi, c. 2 km west-north-west from Agia Paraskevi (see TABLE I and FIG. 2) the remains of two Archaic temples stand on an east plateau of the Skepasto hill 100 m above sea level.227 A prehistoric phase of activity was detected at the site by Evangelidis between the two Archaic temples, the semicircular section of a building constructed of small stones.228 Inside the building was a whole EBA pyxis of coarse red-black fabric with two tab 219 Perpatontas, 604 and pl. 136; Gazetteer, 15 (site 64). 220 A sketch of the jug and cutaway spout comparable to examples from Thermi and Yortan (Thermi, fig. 26. 3-4 and pl. XII: 116; Yortan, figs. 45-64) was shown to us by M. Axiotis in 1994- 221 See n. 219. The piece is very similar to the plain lid with central knob that is common at Thermi: Thermi, pl.

Some 2 km inland and halfway along the road between the modern resort of Skala Eresou (the site of classical Eresos) and the present-day village of Eresos are two rugged hill-top sites close together with prehistoric material whose closest affinities are to Thermi Class A-B pottery.233 A sherd in the BSA (38) was identified by French as being of 'Troy I type'.234 The material presented by Schaus supports the assertion of French and indicates material related to Thermi I-III, including inverted rims and tubular lugs. TABLE I indicates that there may well be many other important EBA sites which remain unconfirmed, but are highlighted here as requiring serious attention in the future. DISCUSSION: SOME INITIAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE PREHISTORIC COLONIZATION AND SETTLEMENT PATTERN OF EBA LESBOS At the beginning of this paper we outlined some of the basic problems and questions which have motivated our exploration of prehistoric Lesbos and also have to be faced by anyone really interested in the early colonization and settlement of the island, the role of Thermi in these processes, and the relationship of the island to its cultural roots in Western Anatolia. These are not merely academic questions, since the underlying themes recur repeatedly through the following millennia and confront us in all our diachronic, regional explorations in the Lydian pottery zone where we are now working on the mainland of Anatolia. It is now time to assess the answers that our material evidence has been able to provide, although only some very sketchy and provisional answers can be put forward at this stage. We have presented above material evidence from eleven sites suggesting a widespread pattern of settlement on Lesbos in the EBA. First of all, several other prehistoric sites of significance exist on the island apart from Thermi, all of which require systematic study. As listed in TABLE I and shown on FIG. 2, these are Mytilene Kastro, Agios Bartholomaios, Agios Fokas, Chalakies, Kourtir, Profitis Ilias (Agia Paraskevi), Profitis Ilias/'Hole Hill' (Eresos), Makara, Palaiokastro (Arisbe), Plati, and Angourelia Sarakinas. We now consider these eleven sites to be of primary importance for even a basic understanding of EBA Lesbos, and it has become clear that a systematic topographical study and intensive surface survey is essential. 229 Ibid., fig. 17. 230 Kontis, 299. 231 Thermi Town I: Thermi, no. 9 (p. 99; red/black fabric with four handles), fig. 26 pyxis I pl.

Moreover, these early sites are found in the Gulf of Kalloni away from Thermi and the east coast. Settlement may therefore have spread from the centre of the island instead of, or as well as, from the east coast. In fact, Chalakies and Kourtir appear to have stylistically the earliest material so far found anywhere on Lesbos. On the east coast, in contrast, only the cave site of Agios Bartholomaios has so far produced any material which may pre-date Thermi, but this pottery appears to be simply a cruder and more basic version of EBA forms, perhaps produced for a purely functional role, rather than genuinely pre- Bronze Age shapes. So far, it is perhaps worth hypothesizing that before the emergence of Thermi as a permanent settlement on the east coast, earlier settlers came to the coasts of the Gulf of Kalloni, perhaps from Chios (or even the Cyclades). Our latest findings from Altinova on the mainland opposite Thermi certainly suggest that pre-Bronze Age material could not have come to Lesbos from this direction, since we have so far found only Bronze Age settlement here.235 The evidence also suggests that by the time of early Thermi (i.e. Towns I-II) there was already a widespread pattern of settlement on Lesbos, to a large extent sharing the same cultural features. Therefore, either the population who settled all of these sites expanded and spread out from Thermi very quickly, or it did not all come from Thermi. The weight of the evidence currently available supports the latter possibility, and suggests that the settlement of Thermi was part of a broader process. As noted in the discussion of the physical parameters of the island near the beginning of the paper, geographically the EBA settlement of Lesbos does indeed appear to resolve into two main regions: the one on the east coast, and the other on the shores of the Gulf of Kalloni. If we accept the evidence from Kourtir, Chalakies, and the other sites in the Kalloni area which suggest pre-EBA activity, and the lack of such evidence on the east coast, we could even suggest that the earlier group is the one in the central part of the island, although such a hypothesis awaits confirmation through excavation at selected sites. Perhaps less speculative is the thesis that EBA sites on Lesbos appear to fall into two topographical types, the one being coastal sites, usually on a promontory affording both sheltered harbours and marine resources, and the other type being inland, usually hilltop sites, often surrounded by good agricultural land or suitable for pastoralism (as indicated by a number of food-processing implements including mortars and grinding-stones) (see TABLE I and FIG. 2).236 A most impressive group of such inland agricultural/pastoral sites has been firmly established in the centre of the island-Profitis Ilias at Agia Paraskevi, Klopedi, Palaiokastro (Arisbe), Gerna, Mosyna, Profitis Ilias (Kremastis) and Taxiarchis tou Trouloti- all of which are in close proximity to each other and lie on or near the main routes through the central plain and across the mountains to the east coast. The east and north-east coasts themselves also have sites which could be described as agricultural (e.g. Plati and Angourelia Sarakinas) but here there is no such density or clustering. From the meagre amount of material described from these sites, they would appear to be contemporary with Thermi I-III (i.e. its early phases) in which case they do not represent the budding-off of surplus population 235 See the findings of the present authors at Altinova cited in n. 14. 236 Axiotis (n. Io6) figs. 1-2.</page><page sequence="34">io6 KYRIACOS LAMBRIANIDES AND NIGEL SPENCER from Thermi itself since the latter was still very small and in its formative stages. Intuitively, one would expect colonization of the island from Thermi to have occurred from the later phases of Towns IV-V when the settlement visibly grew in size and became a centrally planned and fortified settlement. Unfortunately there is no evidence to support this model at present since it remains to be investigated and factually established (principally by excavation). At present, it would appear that the rest of the island was already settled by the time of Thermi I-II (i.e. the earlier towns) and that Thermi developed in size and complexity (Towns IV and V) thereafter. Whether it developed into a monumental centre with a ruling 61ite, as its later phases suggest, and whether it came to dominate these other smaller settlements, can only be speculated upon until such time as excavation of other sites is possible. The evidence presented above is sufficient even now to reject the conventional unilineal model of colonization and settlement of Lesbos from the east with one initial beachhead at Thermi, as proposed by Lamb.237 The cultural and demographic influences affecting Lesbos are almost certainly derived from multiple sources: strong affinities exist with north-west and south-west Anatolia, but a prominent part was played also by Chios and the Aegean, meaning that the island should be regarded as a distinct entity, perhaps best described as 'Aegean coastal cultural complex' which it forms with the coastal mainland sites of Altlnova and the Bakir Qgay valley. As we are finding from our fieldwork, Altinova provides a direct link between the east coast of Lesbos and the Bakir gay valley, where very many EBA sites have been found. This valley leads up to Yortan cemetery and the related settlements in the inland plains of Bahkesir, of Akhisar-Manisa and the Gediz valley. Through Chios, Lesbos could come into contact both with Aegean islands such as Samos, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, and with the Maeander valley which penetrates deep into the interior of Anatolia up to Beycesultan. Undoubtedly, all these sources of influence must have exerted their effect on the island in various ways, but they still require extensive investigation.238 University College London Institute ofArchaeology, Oxford KYRIACOS LAMBRIANIDES NIGEL SPENCER CATALOGUE Chalakies I.
