Metis is most simply translated as “cunning,” 1 For an account that reviews and criticizes scholarly discourses on this transition, see Bruce Lincoln, “Mythos among the Greeks,” pt. 1 in Theorizing Myth: Narrative, Ideology, and Scholarship (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 1999), 3–43. 2 Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant, Les ruses d’intelligence: La mètis des grecs (Paris: Flammarion et Cie, 1974), and Cunning Intelligence in Greek Culture and Society, trans.

It is applied to situations which are transient, shifting, disconcerting and ambiguous, situa- tions which do not lend themselves to precise measurement, exact calculation or rigorous logic . . . [It is] a type of  intelligence which, although it continued to operate in large areas such as politics, the military art, medicine and the skills of  the artisan, nevertheless appears to have been displaced and devalued in com- parison with what henceforth represented the key element in Greek learning.4 Although Detienne and Vernant here suggest that philosophers disparaged metis for the same reason that they rejected or tried to tame the myths of the poets—namely, that it was ill suited for thinking and talking about the realm of  being—they also propose that metis was problematic because it gave the lie to the dichotomous structure of  reality that philosophers had so laboriously delineated in their struggles against the religious and peda- gogical authority of  the poets. In the intellectual world of  the Greek philosopher . . . there is a radical dichotomy between being and becoming, between the intelligible and the sensible. . . . These contrasting concepts . . . form a complete system of  antinomies defining two mutually exclusive spheres of  reality. On the one hand there is the sphere of being, of  the one, the unchanging, of  the limited, of  true and definite knowl- edge; on the other, the sphere of  becoming, of  the multiple, the unstable and the unlimited, of  oblique and changeable opinion. Within this framework of  thought there can be no place for metis. Metis is characterised precisely by the way it operates by continuously oscillating between two opposite poles. It turns into their contraries objects that are not yet defined as stable, circumscribed, mutually exclusive concepts but which appear as Powers in a situation of  confronta- tion. . . . When the individual who is endowed with metis, be he god or man, is confronted with a multiple, changing reality whose limitless polymorphic powers render it almost impossible to seize, he can only dominate it . . . if  he proves him- self  to be even more multiple, more mobile, more polyvalent than his adversary.5 3 Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life, trans.

Among the more notable of  these are Burton L. Mack’s efforts to uncover the original, Cynic-sage character of  Jesus of  Nazareth’s outlook and message and Lisa Raphals’s work on Chinese thought and religion.6 There has yet to appear, however, any substantial application of  the French scholars’ insights to the study of  Norse culture and myth.7 This article attempts such an application. In it, I focus on two figures of  Norse myth, as they are known from textual sources mostly produced or preserved by medieval Icelanders, who embody the qualities of  metic intelligence described by Detienne and Vernant. I will also compare the role that Detienne and Vernant reveal cunning intelligence to play in Greek myth to the role it plays in Norse myth. To summarize, Detienne and Vernant conclude that cunning intelligence—the only power ultimately capable of  resisting or overcoming superior force—is treated in Greek myth as necessary to the maintenance of  sovereignty: the supreme god, Zeus, is able to absolutize his authority and eternalize his reign only once he has incorporated, quite literally, the embodiment of  this power. In Norse myth, I will argue, the same relationship between cunning intelligence and sovereignty is posited, namely, that control over the former is required for those who would epitomize the latter. The outcome of  events is, however, very dif- ferent: rather than cunning intelligence being assimilated to the mytho- logical sovereign, it remains partially and perhaps principally invested in a figure who is ultimately instrumental in resisting and overcoming the sovereign and his order. In performing my comparisons, I neither intend nor attempt to connect Greek and Norse myths historically or genetically. While I do not deny the possibility or even the likelihood that these connections exist, I agree with Jonathan Z. Smith that attempts to establish such links are generally of  use to apologetic agendas that seek to privilege one of  the two terms being compared as either the source of  the other or the closer to some putative and often hypothetical original. In such an enterprise, what rules “is an overwhelming concern for assigning value, rather than intellectual 6 Burton L.

Oddly enough, it appears in a discussion of  Êórr, a god rather lacking in this form of  intelligence; see Margaret Clunies Ross, “Êórr’s Honour,” in Studium zum Altgermanischen: Festschrift für Heinrich Beck, ed.

It is the scholar who makes their cohabitation—their ‘sameness’—possible, not ‘natural’ affinities or processes of  history.”9 My purpose, then, in comparing is to consider how similar yet not identical phenomena arise from and interact with different contexts and actors to test certain hypotheses. More specifically, my goal in this article is to compare how two sets of  myths depict attempts by sovereign figures to control and/or harness the powers of  cunning intelli- gence, and to speculate about how differences in the outcome of  these attempts might reflect differences in the myths’ contexts and the interests of  their producers/consumers. I have been inspired by Detienne’s and Vernant’s analyses of  Greek materials, just as I take advantage of  some of  their conclusions. masters of me ¤tis among the norse gods The figure that first springs to mind when we are looking for examples of cunning intelligence at work in Norse myth is Loki. As Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1178/9–1241) writes in his Edda (ca. 1220–25), a handbook of  poetry and myth that is our most accessible native source for pre- Christian Norse religion, “That one is also numbered among the æsir [sing. áss; the principal “tribe” of  Norse gods] who some call slanderer of  the æsir and originator of  deceits and blemish of  all gods and men. He is called Loki, or Loptr, son of  Fárbauti the giant. His mother is Laufey, or Nál. . . . Loki is handsome and fair in appearance, evil in character, very changeable in his ways. He possessed that intelligence in greater degree than other men that is called cunning [slœgd], and tricks for every occasion. He brought the æsir constantly into great difficulty, and often he extricated them with his schemes.”10 Before considering the attributes here assigned to Loki, some discussion of  what sort of  being he is sup- posed to be is needed. John Lindow, in his guide to Norse myth, makes much of  the fact that Snorri states that “Loki is ‘also numbered among 8 Jonathan Z.

Given, then, that the sources do not seem con- sistently to align mythic beings’ genealogies with their social identities, Loki’s ancestry will not be treated by me as a key to his nature or function. All æsir are nominal æsir, as far as I am concerned here. Setting questions of  ancestry and identity aside, we notice that the key traits of  Loki according to Snorri’s description are that he is cun- ning, prone to trickery, resourceful, and duplicitous. A shorter descrip- tion from later in Snorri’s Edda presents a similar set of  qualities, stating that Loki in poetry is called “bölva smidr, hinn slœgi Áss, rœgjandi ok vélandi godanna” (maker of  mischiefs, the cunning áss, calumniator and tricker of  the gods).15 While only the first of  the kennings, or poetic 11 John Lindow, Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 216, s.v. “Loki.” 12 Ibid.

The source for a giant as Tyr’s father is stanza 5 of  the eddic poem Hymiskvida, in Edda: Die Lieder des Codex Regius nebst verwandten Denk- mälern, vol. 1, Text, ed. Gustav Neckel, 5th ed. rev.

Loki is also said to have forged a sword called lævateinn, “læ-wand,” in the under- world (Fjölsvinnsmál [Sayings of  Fjölsvidr] 26, in Die Lieder der Edda, ed. Barend Sijmons and Hugo Gering, 3 vols. [Halle: Buchhandlung des Waisenhauses, 1903–31], 1:207). Further, there is reference to a læva lundr, “tree of  deceit (or poison),” which is either a kenning for Loki or for something he uses—e.g., a wand—against Idunn in Haustlöng 11 (The “Haust- löng” of Êjódólfr of Hvinir, ed. and trans. Richard North [Enfield Lock, Middlesex: Hisarlik Press, 1997], 7).

While Jan de Vries rejects identification of  Loki and Lódurr, he does review the arguments of  those who favor it (see his The Problem of Loki, Folklore Fellows Communications 110 [Helsinki: Suomalainen tiedeakatemia, 1937], 36–37, 49–55, and Alt- </page> <page sequence="7"> History of Religions 217 some treat the term lá as identical with læ, in which case (assuming Lódurr is in fact identical to Loki) this figure not only typifies this quality but also supplies humanity with it.20 As final examples, taken from the corpus of  skaldic poems (which typically are differentiated from eddic poems by their more ornate form and ascription to named poets), Loki is called “bragdvíss” (wise in tricks) in Êjódólfr of  Hvinir’s Haustlöng; “firna slœgr” (terribly sly) in Úlfr Uggason’s Húsdrápa; and “drjúgr at ljúga” (proficient at lying) in Eilífr Gudrúnarson’s Êórsdrápa.21 Although we have not yet considered any narratives about him, it is clear from these descriptions of  Loki that he embodies many of  the qualities discussed by Detienne and Vernant under the heading of  metis. Thus, it is not surprising that while scholars’ interpretations of  the core Loki or ur-Loki have varied enormously—he has been seen as everything from an elemental spirit of  fire, water, or air to a trickster or culture-hero, to a chthonic demon of  death, to, most infamously, a spider—many have viewed the trait of  cunning as fundamental to his character.22 But while germanische Religionsgeschichte, 2 vols. [Berlin: de Gruyter, 1957], 2:271–72), as does Folke Ström, who accepts their equation (see his Loki: Ein mythologisches Problem, Göteborgs Uni- versitets Årsskrift 62, no. 8 [Göteborg: Elander, 1956], 52–54). For a more recent discussion by a scholar who accepts the identification, see Poetic Edda, Dronke ed. and trans., 2:125. 20 Cleasby and Gudbrandur Vigfússon, Icelandic-English Dictionary, 403. 21 Haustlöng 5, North ed. and trans., 4; for the stanzas from Húsdrápa and Êórsdrápa, see Skáldskaparmál 16 and 18, Faulkes ed., 20 and 26; translations from Edda, Faulkes trans., 77 and 83. The first poem is from ca. 900, the latter two from the tenth century. Descriptors for Loki used by Snorri and the poets are echoed in the relatively late, prose Sörla Âáttr (Sörli’s tale; this text is found in a fourteenth-century manuscript as part of  Óláfs saga Trygg- vasonar en mesta), which nicknames him “Loki læuiss” and (like Snorri) says that of  all beings Loki has the greatest “slægd” (cunning); see Sörla Âáttr, in Flateyjarbók: En samling af norske konge-sagaer, ed. Gudbrandur Vigfússon and C. R. Unger, 3 vols. (Oslo: P. T. Malling, 1860– 68), 1:275. 22 In the late 1930s, Willy Krogmann wrote of  Loki, based mainly on considerations of etymology and runic evidence, that “his cunning must in the future be regarded as the major trait of  his character” (muss seine Arglist in Zukunft als der Hauptzug seines Wesens betrachtet werden) (“Loki,” Acta Philologica Scandinavica 12 [1937–38]: 59–70, quote at 70). Many have echoed this general judgment before and since. It may be noted here that Georges Dumézil argued in a book-length study, based partly on an extended but in the end rather inessential comparison with the Ossetian figure Syrdon, that Loki ought to be regarded as a Norse personification of  the abstract psychological quality “impulsive intelligence.” Dumézil describes Loki as “inventive and resourceful, yet he does not look far ahead: abandoning himself  entirely to the moment and to his impulse . . . he is surprised by the results of  his actions, but tries at once to make them good” (Er ist erfinderisch und findig, doch er blickt nicht weit: Ganz dem Augenblick und seinem Impuls, . . . hingegeben wird er von den Folgen seiner Handlungen überrascht, versucht sie aber sofort wiedergutzumachen) (Loki, trans. Inge Köck [Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1959], 123). While Dumézil’s core idea, that Loki is in many ways best regarded as a mythic personification of an abstract mental quality, is clearly not far removed from my own, his understanding ulti- mately contradicts my view that Loki is a metic figure, an instantiation of  what Detienne and Vernant call “informed prudence” (Cunning Intelligence, 11). Dumézil, to the contrary, char- acterizes the rather ill-defined and passive áss Hœnir, whom I discuss near the end of  the last section of  this article, as the instantiation of  prudent intelligence and, thus, as Loki’s opposite </page> <page sequence="8"> 218 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth Loki’s ranking as Norse myth’s paradigmatic instantiation of  metic intel- ligence might, therefore, seem secure, there is a figure of  equal if  not greater importance to the overall mythos who gives Loki a run for this distinction. This is the chief  god, Ódinn. While no passage ascribes metic qualities to Ódinn as explicitly and succinctly as those from Snorri’s Edda do for Loki, we find when looking at the stories that are told about each that almost every activity and trait that make Loki a model of  cunning apply also to Ódinn. One ability considered by Detienne and Vernant essential to masters of metis is the changing or masking of  form or aspect. Metis is a “power of  metamorphosis” as well as of  “disguise. In order to dupe its victim it assumes a form which masks, instead of  revealing, its true being. In metis [sic] appearance and reality no longer correspond to one another but stand in contrast.”23 It is true that Ódinn and Loki do not exhibit identical powers or habits of  transformation. To some extent, it is appropriate to view Loki as the greater master of  metamorphosis and Ódinn as the master of  disguise. In other words, while Loki’s transformations are usually physical, Ódinn’s often involve just changes of  outfit or sometimes just changes of  name rather than of  form. A reason for this difference may be that while Loki is rarely concerned with concealing his identity as such, Ódinn frequently seeks to do so, because the success of  his “mission” often depends on his foes’ not recognizing him until the right moment.24 This difference fades from view, however, when we consider instances in which these two gods adopt animal forms: Loki becomes a fly to distract a dwarf from his forging and becomes a salmon to try to escape from the æsir who want to punish him for Baldr’s death, while Ódinn transforms into a snake to gain entry through a small hole into a cave.25 Loki and Ódinn even in one case engage in the same particular animal transformation when, on separate occasions, each flees in the shape of  a bird with a stolen (or recovered) treasure in his beak from a giant who, also in bird’s form, (Loki, 224–31). I argue, however, that Loki is ultimately shown by the mythos to have the most forethought of  any of  the æsir or, at least, that his plans are the ones that ultimately come to fruition. As for the other interpretations of  the ur-Loki I have mentioned, most have been offered by a certain number of  scholars, and these schools of  thought have been re- viewed many times; see, e.g., Ström, Loki, 7–8; de Vries, Problem of Loki, 10–27, and Alt- germanische Religionsgeschichte, 2:265–67; and Stefanie von Schnurbein, “The Function of  Loki in Snorri Sturluson’s Edda,” trans. Lilian Friedberg, History of Religions 40, no. 2 (2000): 109–24, esp. 112–13. 23 Detienne and Vernant, Cunning Intelligence, 20–21. 24 For a discussion of  narratives of  such missions of  Ódinn, see Kevin J. Wanner, “God on the Margins: Dislocation and Transience in the Myths of  Ódinn,” History of Religions 46, no. 4 (2007): 316–50, esp. 329–30. 25 For Loki’s transformations, see Skáldskaparmál 35, Faulkes ed., 42; Gylfaginning 50, Faulkes ed., 48–49; for Ódinn’s transformation, see Skáldskaparmál G58, Faulkes ed., 4. </page> <page sequence="9"> History of Religions 219 pursues him to Ásgardr.26 In each of  these cases, the transformation attains for the god an end apart from or beyond that of  mere disguise. Ódinn and Loki are also alike in that both switch gender and/or take on feminine qualities. There is only one story of  Ódinn’s appearing as a woman: in the Dane Saxo Grammaticus’s Gesta Danorum (early 1200s), Ódinn (Othinus), here euhemerized as a decadent monarch of  Byzantium, uses magic to adopt several disguises in his efforts to trick or force a re- luctant princess to have sex with him, finally attaining this end while in the form of  a female physician.27 Loki, on the other hand, transforms into a female, either in appearance or in reality, on each of  the four occasions when he adopts an alternative humanoid form: for example, in Loka- senna, Ódinn accuses Loki of  having been “eight winters . . . beneath the earth, a woman milking cows, and there you bore children, and I con- sider that an unmanly quality [args adal]”; and in another eddic poem, Êrymskvida (Êrymr’s poem), both Loki and the god Êórr disguise them- selves in drag in order to retrieve Êórr’s stolen hammer at a feast of  the giants.28 Even if, however, Loki is the main gender bender of  the pair, it should be noted that Ódinn does not escape being labeled as womanish. In Lokasenna, Loki responds to Ódinn’s accusation that Loki is “unmanly” by stating that the chief  god had beaten drums like a witch on an island, “and I considered that an args adal.”29 Loki is not alone, moreover, in calling Ódinn unmanly: in Ynglinga saga (ca. 1225), the first of  a col- leciton of  kings’ sagas long ascribed to Snorri Sturluson, Ódinn, here a Trojan king who has colonized the North, is said to practice the art of  seidr, from which “flows such great effeminacy [ergi] that it seems to men not without shame to practice it.”30 Thus, for both Loki and Ódinn, identity, species, and gender are fluid categories.

[Metis] is, in a sense, the absolute weapon, the only one that has the power to ensure victory and domination over others, what- ever the circumstances, whatever the conditions of  the conflict.”31 Singly or together, Ódinn and Loki habitually confront adversaries stronger than themselves. Both are repeatedly taken hostage by jötnar, or by men, or, in Loki’s case, by the other æsir.32 So long as such encounters remain straightforward contests of  might or physical ability, neither ever triumphs alone. Victory or extrication from such situations comes for both through one of  two means: either they wait for the arrival or rely on the action of  an ally with sufficient strength to overcome their foes—this is almost always the thunder-god Êórr—or else they plan or watch for the moment when their cunning can reverse the trajectory of  the contest or end it in their favor. This pivotal act can take many forms. In some instances, as I have described, they adopt a shape that allows them to make an unexpected escape or entry; in other instances, they wait for the opportune moment to cast off  a disguise or assumed form; sometimes, they arrange a timely distraction; often, they use their mouths or wits, bargaining with their captors, deploying clever or sophistic arguments, or telling riddles or outright lies; finally, in cases in which their enemies seem to have gotten the better of  them, they flee with a parting curse, which invariably comes true.33 The evidence I have presented thus far is, I hope, sufficient to persuade that although there are differences in the nature, scope, and applications 31 Detienne and Vernant, Cunning Intelligence, 13. 32 Ódinn is taken hostage by a human king in the eddic poem Grímnismál and, along with Loki, by the giant Hreidmarr for the killing of  his son Otr, as narrated in Völsunga saga 14 (Völsunga saga: The Saga of the Volsungs; The Icelandic Text according to MS Nks 1824 b, 4o, ed. and trans.

G. van Hamel has offered reasons for regarding this epilogue as originally sepa- rate material; see his “The Prose-Frame of  Lokasenna,” Neophilogus 14 [1929]: 204–14). 33 Many references to Ódinn’s or Loki’s use of  such tactics have already been given. Among instances in which Ódinn reveals his identity to great effect are the climaxes of  the eddic poems VafÂrúdnismál and Grímnismál. There are many instances of  each god’s use of types of  verbal cunning: for Ódinn’s cursing enemies as he departs, see Grímnismál 53, in Edda, Neckel ed., 68; and chap. 9 in Saga Heidreks Konungs ins Vitra: The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise, ed. and trans.

Having established this, I seek in the remainder of  this article to answer a major question: Why are metic qualities or powers so prominent in Norse myth? Or, to frame this question slightly differently, Why do two of  the three most central and active figures of  these myths (the other being Êórr) so eminently embody this brand of  intelligence? Although— as my discussion will suggest and (occasionally) explicitly argue—one cannot really understand one of  these gods apart from the other, I will focus more heavily on Loki than on Ódinn in what follows, for two reasons. First, in a previous article I examined myths of  Ódinn in some detail, emphasizing the themes of  marginality and transience that pervade them: both the god and the order he protects are shown to cling to existence precariously. All victories are tactical and temporary, serving perhaps to stave off  but never to thwart the inevitability of  ragnarök, the “doom of  the gods,” in which both god and world order will meet their end.34 I stressed, in short, how distinctly non-Platonic Norse notions of  deity and cosmos are, lacking as they do the qualities of  eternity, stasis, and perfection. The second, and more important, reason is that despite the overlap in their customary powers and the uses to which they put them, there is a clear difference in the way in which Ódinn’s and Loki’s characters and deeds are evaluated in existing sources. This disparity, I think, is not, as has often been claimed, primarily moral in nature. While it can be con- ceded that our sources on the whole take a more positive view of  Ódinn than of  Loki, differences in their moral evaluations of  these characters should not be exaggerated. Indeed, if  Loki is the most disparaged of  the gods, Ódinn runs a close second. In sources poetic and prose, pre- and postconversion, vernacular and Latin, Ódinn is routinely described as de- ceitful, capricious, and engaging in dishonorable and shameful behavior.35 While Loki is called “bölva smidr,” one of  Ódinn’s pseudonyms, attested in multiple sources, is “Bölverkr” (Doer of  evil).36 In Lokasenna, when 34 For my earlier article, see n. 24 above. While Snorri uses the spelling ragnarøkr, “twi- light of  the gods,” I use the more usual ragnarök (except when I am quoting him). 35 Ström, Loki, 81–82; H. R. Ellis Davidson, Gods and Myths of Northern Europe (London: Penguin, 1964), 50; E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia (London: Wiedenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1964), 50–53; and Wanner, “God on the Margins,” 330–31, 336–37: all these studies cite and summarize primary materials that raise moral questions about (or openly condemn) Ódinn’s character or actions, most often in the context of  his dealings with warriors, kings, and nobles. 36 For the name “Bölverkr,” see Gylfaginning 20, Faulkes ed., 22; Skáldskaparmál G58, Faulkes ed., 4; and the eddic poems Hávamál 109 and Grímnismál 47, in Edda, Neckel ed., 34 and 66–67. </page> <page sequence="12"> 222 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth Loki publicly accuses Ódinn of  practicing unmanly arts, neither Ódinn nor any of  the æsir present defend him against this charge; indeed, Ódinn’s own wife Frigg seems to confirm its validity when she implores the pair to maintain silence concerning “what you two æsir engaged in in days of  yore.”37 Furthermore, although Loki will ultimately turn on his longtime allies, it should not be overlooked that Ódinn is repeatedly rep- rimanded for betraying his chief  followers—kings and warrior-heroes. Another accusation Loki levels against Ódinn in Lokasenna is that “often you gave, that which you should not give, victory to the less worthy,” and Helgakvida Hundingsbana önnur (The second poem of  Helgi Hundingr’s slayer) offers this damning judgment of  the chief  god: “Ódinn alone causes all evil, because he bore runes of  strife between kinsmen.”38 Even the guileless Êórr confirms Loki’s and others’ judgments on Ódinn’s character when in the eddic poem Hárbardsljód (Hárbardr’s song) he calls his father “ragr” (a pervert) and his mind “illr” (evil).39 The distinction, then, in the sources’ evaluations of  Loki and Ódinn does not seem to be that one is evil while the other is good. Instead, the difference is that, while both figures possess and deploy metic intelligence in similar ways, it is only Loki whose character is explicitly and fundamentally defined as “cunning” or “sly.” Another question, then, that I will seek to answer in the rest of this article is, Why is this so? Preliminarily, my hypothesis is that Loki may be regarded as Norse myth’s principal or primordial manifestation of metic powers and abilities, while Ódinn’s are best described as secondary or even derivative. If  this hypothesis can be demonstrated, it has pro- found implications for the interpretation of  these figures’ interrelation- ship and mythic functions. Attempting to say anything new and substantial about Loki’s role in Norse myth is a daunting task. Studies of  Loki are legion, lengthy, and less than unified in their conclusions. Titles of  articles such as Anne Holts- mark’s “Loki—en omstridt skikkelse i nordisk mytologi” (Loki—a con- troversial figure in Norse mythology), Jens Peter Schjødt’s “Om Loki endnu engang” (About Loki once again), and Jan de Vries’ “Loki . . . und kein Ende” (Loki . . . and no end) testify to scholarly fatigue and despair at ever coming to grips with “the problem of  Loki” (another of  de Vries’s titles).40 This has hardly stopped anyone from trying, however.

A desire to respect the intricacies of  the former while avoiding the pitfalls of  the latter has resulted in a row of  studies aiming at exhaustion, that dutifully catalog all the elements of  Loki’s mythos before attempting a synoptic distillation of  the fundaments of  his character and/or function.41 This exercise has been repeated so often that Loki studies threaten to reach the point at which—as Jonathan Z. Smith has warned biblical scholarship—its analytic map simply replicates the territory under analysis and thus loses “both utility and . . . cognitive advantage.”42 In my analysis, then, I will not hesitate to leave elements of  Loki’s mythos aside, and I will resist the temptation to account for every anomalous datum relative to my thesis. I also will not treat earlier studies in much detail, although to those who know them it will quickly become clear that I agree, on at least a point or two, with almost everyone who has weighed in on the topic of  Loki.43 As in bible studies, this ground has been sufficiently worked over that I doubt whether much could be said that is genuinely new and simultaneously founded in the sources. If  the perspective I offer on Loki has any claim to originality, it is in my alignment of  this figure with a specific interest group. Part of  my jus- tification, then, for taking another pass at Loki is that earlier treatments have considered the motivation of  the story logic or the actors in the myths but have lacked sufficient consideration of  the motivations of  those who produced our sources for Loki’s character and exploits. In studies of Loki, relatively little attention has been paid to questions such as those posed by Bruce Lincoln in the fourth of  his “theses on method” for the study of  religion: “The same destabilizing and irreverent questions one might ask of  any speech act ought be posed of  religious discourse. The first of  these is ‘Who speaks here?’, i.e., what person, group, or institution is responsible for a text, whatever its putative or apparent author. Beyond 41 Among the twentieth-century studies attempting such comprehensive treatments are de Vries, Problem of Loki; Ström, Loki; Dumézil’s 1959 edition of  Loki (see n. 22 above), which is a translated and expanded version of  the original French edition (Loki [Paris: Maisonneuve, 1949]); Anna Birgitta Rooth, Loki in Scandinavian Mythology, Skrifter utgivna av Kungliga humanistiska Vetenskapssamfundet i Lund 51 (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1961); and Schjødt, “Om Loki endnu engang.” 42 Smith, Relating Religion, 209. 43 One method of  explaining Loki to which I do not pay much attention is the etymo- logical. Although Loki’s name has been understood in many ways—it has been derived from or connected with, e.g., Old Norse logi, “fire”; Swedish locke, “spider”; and even the name “Lucifer”—and although I lack the expertise to weigh options against one another on strictly linguistic grounds, I favor connecting “Loki” with Old Norse lúka (pp. lokinn), meaning “to end,” “finish,” or “close” (see discussions in de Vries, Problem of Loki, 13–15, and Alt- germanische Religionsgeschichte, 2:265), since this solution dovetails with my theory that Loki functions to render sovereignty impermanent. </page> <page sequence="14"> 224 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth that, ‘To what audience?

What are the consequences if  this project of  persuasion should happen to succeed? Who wins what, and how much? Who, conversely, loses?’ ”44 In the present case, such questions become, To whom do we owe the extant mythos of  Loki? What were they doing, or aiming to do, through its construction? In short, Whose god was Loki? To experts in Norse myth, this may seem an odd or even nonsensical question, given that one of  the few points of  consensus among Loki scholars is that this god “had no cult.”45 To many, he is best thought of  not as a god at all but as an “epical figure”—or, to use a marvelously literal Norwegian term, a gjennomgangsfigur, a cipher whose purpose is to supply a connecting thread for story cycles, filling whatever roles are needed along the way. He has been regarded, in short, as “more at home in a novellistic tale than in a real myth.”46 This view is not without merit or support; one of  the earliest extant kennings for Loki, sagna hrærir, can be translated “mover (or rouser) of  tales.”47 Never- theless, I do not think it gives enough credit to the coherence of  Loki’s portrait. It also tends to discourage consideration of  this figure’s ideo- logical uses. Others who have treated Norse myth as ideology—that is, as a rhetorical discourse that seeks to establish, express, reinforce, contest, and/or transform social, political, and material realities and relations— have tended to shy away from identifying Loki with any particular set of real-world actors or partisans. In contrast, I contend, and will attempt to demonstrate in this article, that many of  the characteristics of  Loki and his myths are better understood if  he is regarded as a god—or, if  using this term for him is objectionable, as an imagined figure whose qualities and actions embody key elements of  the outlook and the interests of 44 Bruce Lincoln, “Theses on Method,” Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 8, no. 3 (1996): 225–27, quote at 225–26. 45 Among many examples of  this consensus, see Dumézil, Loki, 1, 219; de Vries, Problem of Loki, 203–4, and Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, 2:265; Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion, 126; Davidson, God and Myths, 163; Ström, Loki, 11; Anne Holtsmark, Norrøn mytologi: Tro og myter i vikingtiden (Oslo: Det Norske Samlaget, 1970), 146; and von Schnurbein, “Function of  Loki,” 110. 46 de Vries, Problem of Loki, 78.

To compare the role played by metic intelligence, its bearers, and their relation to power in Greek myth versus Norse myth, I will begin by focusing on what Detienne and Vernant call the myth about sovereignty related in Hesiod’s Theogony (ca. 730–700 BC).48 In thus characterizing this poem’s subject, Detienne and Vernant refer not to a limited expression of  sovereignty, to authority instantiated or exercised by this or that entity, but to sovereignty as such, which by definition is universal and unimpeach- able. The Theogony, in their view offers a myth in which “the established order” attains both “stability and permanence.”49 While in Platonic phi- losophy such a pure or ideal notion must be represented abstractly, myth permits it to receive concrete form, which in Hesiod’s case is the god Zeus. M. L. West, editor and translator of  the Theogony, similarly perceives at the core of  Hesiod’s poem a “Succession Myth”—or, perhaps better, what we might call an End-of-Succession Myth—that traces the process through which Zeus’s power is rendered absolute and everlasting. The poem’s climax, West writes, “puts a stop to the chain of  revolutions, and ensures that Zeus shall not be overthrown in his turn.”50 Though Zeus attains this status by usurping the place of  his father, he need not fear the same fate for himself: “In Greek myth, the son stronger than Zeus is a threat that does not materialize.”51 While Zeus is shown by Hesiod to possess wits and strength of  his own from the start, his rule becomes permanent only after he has co-opted and in some cases incorporated the powers of  others. One key power acquired by Zeus is that of  lightning, or the thunderbolt, given to him by the Cyclopes. Once Zeus possesses this weapon, none can overcome him in 48 Detienne and Vernant, Cunning Intelligence, 6, 58. On the dating of  this poem, see Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, trans. M. L.

The way in which Hesiod has the god gain final control over this power is none too subtle—Zeus marries and then swallows its personification. West presents this incorporation in his prose translation of  the Theogony, in what in his opinion are its last genuinely Hesiodic lines: Zeus as king of  the gods made Metis his first wife, the wisest among gods and mortal men. But when she was about to give birth to the pale-eyed goddess Athene, he tricked her deceitfully with cunning words and put her away in his belly on the advice of  Earth and starry Heaven. They advised him in this way so that no other of  the gods . . . should have the royal station instead of  Zeus. For from Metis it was destined that clever children should be born: first a pale- eyed daughter . . . with courage and sound counsel equal to her father’s, and then a son she was to bear, king of  gods and men, one proud of  heart. But Zeus put her away in his belly first, so that the goddess could advise him of  what was good or bad.53 In this way, observes Vernant, Zeus becomes “the incarnation of  the cunning foresight that allows him to thwart the plan of  anyone who might hope to surprise him, to catch him off  guard. . . . All is well once Zeus swallows Metis and thereby becomes the Metioeis—the god who is fully metis [sic]: resourcefulness personified. . . . Once Zeus is enthroned and established, nothing and no one can set him aside and sit on his throne.”54 Zeus alone achieves this status since, as Detienne and Vernant remark, “whatever the strength of  a man or a god, there always comes a time when he confronts one stronger than himself. Only superior metis can give supremacy the two qualities of  permanence and universality which turn it into truly sovereign power. . . . Thanks to the metis within him Zeus is now forewarned of  everything . . . that is in store for him. For him there is no gap between a plan and its fulfillment such as enables the unexpected to intervene in the lives of  other gods and mortals.”55 Thus Zeus, in a move philosophers must view as ironic, has elevated himself  into the sphere of  being through mastery of  the force that ensures successful negotiation of  the realm of  becoming. He has effectively become an ideal form: “Zeus is no ordinary king. By marrying, master- 52 Hesiod, Theogony, line 385, West ed., 126. 53 Hesiod, Theogony, lines 886–900, in “Theogony” and “Works and Days,” West trans., 29; and see Hesiod, Theogony, West ed., 144–45.

The same cannot be said, however, of  Ódinn, who is in every way a less impressive figure than Zeus. This is less true, how- ever, if  the two are compared in the preliminary stages of  their careers. According to their respective cosmogonies, neither Zeus nor Ódinn be- longed to the first generation of  beings. Neither were they always rulers. To attain power, both had to rise up violently against their progenitors, from whom they and their allies are from then on nominally (or, as the myths would have it, tribally or racially) distinguished. Just as Zeus over- throws and imprisons his father (Kronos) and the other Titans and then reigns as king of  the Olympian gods, so Ódinn kills his grandfather (the jötunn Ymir) and then rules over the cosmos, which he has fashioned (with the help of  his two brothers) from Ymir’s dismembered corpse, as chief  of  the æsir. Clearer differences between Zeus and Ódinn emerge when the measures each takes to attain sovereign power are compared. Zeus, as we have seen, receives from the Cyclopes the thunderbolt, and he swallows Metis. He thus takes immediate control of  both strength and cunning, wielding the paradigmatic symbol of  the former with his own hands and literally incorporating the latter. Ódinn’s situation is different. As for physical strength, Ódinn is himself  without it, or else rarely displays it. Although a god of  war, Ódinn intervenes in battle as a general or sorcerer rather than as a champion or soldier—although one finds in Saxo or in Snorri’s more euhemeristic moments vague statements about Ódinn as a participant in battle, there are few specific reports of  his exploits and none that are particularly noble.57 His major contributions to warfare are strategic, as when he teaches kings the devastating “wedge-shaped” formation, or magical, as when he inspires berserkr frenzies or casts his spear over opposing armies to fill them with fear and/or to dedicate their about-to- be-slain to himself.58 He himself  is only ever in one real fight, which he 56 Ibid., 109, see also 68; and Vernant, Universe, 28. 57 Saxo provides one of  the few references to Ódinn personally (and ignobly) commit- ting violence in battle; see bk. 8 in Saxonis Grammatici Gesta Danorum, in Holder ed., 263. Although aside from at ragnarök, Snorri does not describe Ódinn participating in battle in his Edda, in chap. 2 of  Ynglinga saga, Ódinn the Trojan king is called a “hermadr mikill” (great warrior) (Heimskringla, Bjarni Adalbjarnarson ed., 1:11), although even here he still acts mainly as a war leader or a source of  inspiration for others in battle. 58 On the wedge formation, see Reginsmál 23, in Edda, Neckel ed., 179; and Saxonis Grammatici Gesta Danorum, Holder ed., 32; on Ódinn’s inspiration of  berserkr frenzies, see Ynglinga saga 6, in Heimskringla, Bjarni Adalbjarnarson ed., 1:17; on Ódinn’s spear, see Völuspá 24, in Edda, Neckel ed., 6. </page> <page sequence="18"> 228 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth loses, badly (more on this shortly). Yet despite Ódinn’s lack of  physical prowess, he, like Zeus, has at his disposal an instrument of  supreme force. This is Mjöllnir, the hammer of  Ódinn’s son Êórr. Like Zeus’s thunder- bolt, Mjöllnir is a weapon without peer—Êórr never fails to kill whatever he strikes—and indeed it is also probably nothing other than a symbol for the power of  lightning and storm. Although Ódinn does not himself  wield this weapon, he does not lack control over it. The quintessential “dumb áss,” Êórr does not operate as an independent agent. A creature of  the status quo, he appears content to remain in his role as defender of  Midgardr and Ásgardr and to use his hammer only against giants, trolls, or other enemies of  the gods and humans. In short, Êórr poses no threat to the sovereignty of  Ódinn, who, as demonstrated most clearly in Hárbardsljód, is more than able to outwit his son if  need arises or simply when he feels like harassing him. Ódinn therefore has his cosmos’s ultimate implement of  brute force under control and thus seems prepared to counter any straightforward threats of  violence short of  the final apocalyptic host of  ragnarök, at which point all bets are off  (more on this at the end of  this section). But what of  cunning, the one power that, according to Detienne and Vernant, must inevitably overcome superior might? This is a quality that, as I have described, Ódinn possesses to an extreme degree, and yet he is matched in it, if  not exceeded, by Loki. Why does Ódinn as sovereign tolerate a rival in this arena? Or, in extramythological terms, Why this redundancy in character and function among the æsir? Two answers have been most commonly given by scholars to the question, If  Ódinn, then why Loki? These answers do not exclude one another and, indeed, have often been offered together. The first is that it behooves Ódinn and the other gods within the framework of  the preserved myths to keep Loki around; having many talents but few scruples or inhibitions, Loki is more able and/or will- ing than they to cross boundaries in order to gain benefits or right things gone wrong. A myth that is often used to support this hypothesis is that of  the giant-builder in Gylfaginning (The deluding of  Gylfi), the first major part of  Snorri’s Edda. In this story, Loki is blamed by the æsir for allowing a giant to use his magically industrious horse to assist in build- ing a new wall for Ásgardr in a set period of  time, for which the giant’s payment will be the sun, the moon, and the goddess Freyja. Under threat of  death, Loki prevents the job from being finished on schedule by trans- forming himself  into a mare and distracting the giant’s helper. The æsir and their cosmos are thus saved from catastrophe, and the gods also get some added bonuses: they get a security fence to protect the borders of their homeland for free (in the end, the giant is not paid anything for his labor, since Êórr smashes in his head once his true nature has been re- vealed), and as a result of  his dalliance with the stallion, Loki gives birth </page> <page sequence="19"> History of Religions 229 to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir, “the best horse among gods and men,” which is given to Ódinn.59 In myths like this, Loki clearly acts as a liminal figure who, employing often drastic or questionable means, helps the æsir to maintain in their dealings with others what Margaret Clunies Ross, following Marshall Sahlins, labels a standard of  “negative reciprocity,” by which she means that they seek to preserve “their own hierarchical superiority” through “stratagems like theft and duplicity rather than the open and public deal- ings one might expect between social groups.”60 In line with this reasoning, Loki has been understood to act as an intermediary who obtains benefits for the gods while preventing or reversing their dispossession by other sorts of  beings.61 While there is much to recommend this common inter- pretation of  Loki’s character and function, I question whether he is in this respect really so different from his fellow deities. After all, all of  the gods active in the myths work to uphold this ideal of  negative reciprocity, and they often suffer injury to themselves or their reputations in doing so, as when Tyr sacrifices his hand to bind the Fenrisúlfr, when Freyr surrenders his sword in return for his servant Skírnir’s forcing the giantess Gerdr to marry him, or when Êórr on multiple occasions violates the rules of  hos- pitality in the halls of  both æsir and jötnar in order to address threats to the mythic status quo. Thus, even if  Loki does often provide a scapegoat for or a solution to problems generated in the gods’ dealings with others, he does not free the other æsir either from enforcing standards of  negative reciprocity or from suffering injuries or indignities in doing so. The second common answer to the question, If  Ódinn, then why Loki? is that Loki’s character developed and expanded in late paganism alongside, and owing to an elevation of, Ódinn’s position in the pantheon—that, in effect, Loki took center stage in those stories and performed those actions no longer deemed fitting for a figure now regarded as chief  of  the gods.62 59 “hestr beztr med godum ok mönnum” (Gylfaginning 42, in Faulkes ed., 35). Many think there is a brief  allusion to the myth of  the giant-builder in Völuspá 25–26, in Edda, Neckel ed., 6. Loki’s giving birth to Sleipnir is also mentioned in Hyndluljód 40, in Edda, Neckel ed., 294. 60 Margaret Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Northern Society, vol. 1, The Myths, Viking Collection 7 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), 143; for her use of  the concept of  negative reciprocity (see 101), Clunies Ross cites Marshall Sahlins, “On the Sociology of  Primitive Exchange,” in The Relevance of Models for Social Anthropology, ed. Michael Banton, A.S.A. Monographs 1 (London: Tavistock, 1965), 139– 236, esp. 148. 61 See Schjødt, “Om Loki endnu engang,” 63, 83; and von Schnurbein, “Function of  Loki,” 117–19. 62 On theories of  Ódinn’s and Loki’s developing personae in “late paganism,” a term which many use—rightly enough, I think—as a periodization covering even the earliest extant sources, and the effects that developments of  one character may have had upon the other, see de Vries, Problem of Loki, 197–99; Ström, Loki, 84–94; and Frakes, “Loki’s Mythological Function,” 171. </page> <page sequence="20"> 230 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth A scholar who has offered both hypotheses while taking this second one to its extreme is Folke Ström, who suggests “dass Loki eine Hypostase Odins ist.”63 Ström elaborates: “In his quality as a secondary Ódinn-figure, Loki has been given a wealth of  more offensive myths, which, had they been about Ódinn, would have injured religious feeling in that moment when he had attained his position as father of  the gods.”64 This is, I think, overall a weaker argument, not only because it relies on speculation about what the myths were like before their recorded versions but also because Ódinn hardly maintains a pristine moral reputation in the extant mythos, as my discussion above has demonstrated. Further, Ström’s theory of  collapsing gods, in which the “Norse Pantheon becomes ultimately reduced to one male and one female deity,” has been considered by most too radical—as Ulf  Drobin acerbically but accurately describes the results of  Ström’s analysis of  the myth of  Baldr’s death, one ends up with Ódinn-Ódinn conspiring with Ódinn-Loki to instigate Ódinn-Hödr to kill Ódinn-Baldr. Nevertheless, Ström is certainly right to stress that Ódinn and Loki approach dramatic and functional identity in the preserved myths, espe- cially insofar as cunning and duplicity are for each among “den offenbar konstitutiven Eigenschaften seines Wesens.”65 What I think is needed to understand where the significant differences in Loki’s and Ódinn’s mythic qualities and functions lie is a consideration not of  the historical development of  their myths but, rather, of  the intra- mythical development of  their relationship. Another aspect of  Ström’s analysis that has been criticized is his suggestion that while there may be an extramythological or historical explanation for Loki’s assimilation to Ódinn, within the framework of  the existing myths Loki is always and essentially one and the same as Ódinn.66 These two figures ought not to be regarded, however, as in the Nicene conception of  the Christian Father and Son, as eternally begetting and begotten hypostaseis of  a single and static divine ousia. Ódinn and Loki are, rather, distinct and temporally conditioned beings whose association is provided in the extant myths with a beginning as well as an end. As Lindow has summarized Loki’s career: 63 Ström, Loki, 85.  64 “In seiner Eigenschaft als sekundäre Odinsfigur ist Loki mit einem Schatz anstössiger Mythen begabt worden, die, hätte es sich um Odin gehandelt, das religiöse Gefühl verletzt hätten im dem Augenblick, wo er seine Stellung als Göttervater erreicht hatte” (ibid.; Ström presents his evidence for these claims on 62–95). 65 Ström, Loki, 82; and see Drobin, “Myth and Epical Motifs,” 27. For other critical re- actions to Ström’s thesis, see de Vries, “Loki . . . und kein Ende,” 6; Anatoly Liberman, “Snorri and Saxo on Útgardaloki, with Notes on Loki Laufeyjarson’s Character, Career, and Name,” in Word Heath, Wortheide, Ordheidi: Essays on Germanic Literature and Usage (1972–1992) (Rome: Il Calamo, 1994), 176–234, esp. 230, and “Some Controversial Aspects of  the Myth of  Baldr,” Alvíssmál 11 (2004): 17–54, esp. 38. One scholar who has come near to Ström in positing Ódinn’s and Loki’s identity is Schneider (see his “Loki,” 248–51). 66 See Schjødt, “Om Loki endnu engang,” 57. </page> <page sequence="21"> History of Religions 231 “It seems that Loki’s allegiance is for the most part with the æsir during the mythic present, but that in the mythic past . . . and in the mythic future . . . he is unabashedly against them.”67 There are, thus, two ques- tions to address now: What are the roots and the nature of  Ódinn’s and Loki’s alliance? When and why does it fall apart? To begin to answer these questions, I return to my comparison of  Norse with Greek myths, looking now to identify an analogue for Loki that will help to illuminate his relationship to and role vis-à-vis Ódinn, regarded as an analogue for Zeus. While it was once fairly common for Loki to be likened to the fire-stealing, quasi-divine figure of  Prometheus, a com- parison especially favored by those who wished to see Loki as a trickster or culture hero such as anthropologists have often identified in Native American or African religions, I will argue that a more instructive ana- logue for Loki is the goddess Metis.68 A number of  scholars have read the sources to suggest that Ódinn’s association with Loki dates from the world’s first days and that it was conceived as a strategy through which the shaper of  the cosmos sought to neutralize a power that would other- wise be inimical to himself  and his order. As de Vries writes, “The blood- brothership with Ódinn, and his resulting admission into the world of  the gods, tamed the dangerous and demonic power of  Loki, and through that his intellectual gifts were placed in the service of  the world-maintaining powers.”69 Here de Vries calls attention to a relatively neglected datum from Loki’s résumé. In Lokasenna, Loki compels Ódinn to allow Loki to stay at a feast he has crashed by reminding Ódinn of  their ancient bond: “Do you remember that, Ódinn, when we two in days of  yore blended blood together? You said you would not taste ale, unless to us both it was borne.”70 This passage provides the basis for my contention that the most suggestive Greek parallel for Loki is not Prometheus the forward-thinking metis-user but, rather, the goddess who is the primal instantiation of  metis 67 Lindow, Norse Mythology, 21. 68 Interpretations of  Loki as a “trickster” or “culture hero” have depended on his procuring of  treasures and weapons for the gods (Skáldskaparmál 35, Faulkes ed., 41–43); his invention of  the net, which is then used against him by the æsir (Gylfaginning 50, Faulkes ed., 48–49); his ambiguous identity; and his sometimes crudely sexual escapades, as when he ties a goat’s beard to his testicles to make the giantess Skadi laugh (Skáldskaparmál G56, Faulkes ed., 2). Perhaps the most recent scholar to champion vigorously this understanding of  Loki is de Vries in Problem of Loki (11, 16–18, and all of  chap. 7, 251–81, where he also discusses most of the older scholarship that adopted this view), although he later abandoned this interpretation under the influence of  Dumézil’s Loki (see de Vries, “Loki . . . und kein Ende,” 9, and Alt- germanische Religionsgeschichte, 2:266–67). 69 “die Blutsbrüderschaft mit Odin und seine dadurch erfolgte Aufnahme in die Götter- welt, die gefährliche Dämonie Lokis gemildert und dadurch seine intellektualen Gaben in den Dienst der die Welt erhaltenden Mächte gestellt wurden” (de Vries, “Loki . . . und kein Ende,” 4; see also Lindow, Norse Mythology, 219). 70 “Mantu Âat, Ódinn, er vid í árdaga blendom blódi saman; ölvi bergia léztu eigi mundo, nema ocr væri bádom borit” (Lokasenna 9, Edda, Neckel ed., 98). </page> <page sequence="22"> 232 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth itself.71 If  Zeus swallowed Metis—which some conjecture he is supposed to have accomplished by getting her to take the form of  water or some other liquid72—as a way to incorporate the power of  cunning intelligence and thereby eternalize his sovereignty, then Ódinn’s mixing of  Loki’s bodily fluid with his own can be read as an effort to attain the same aim. Such an interpretation of  this act has been offered by Schjødt, who suggests that it be understood as part of  Ódinn’s quest to defend his supremacy and the cosmic order by acquiring different kinds of  wisdom and skills, particularly from the underworld or the dead.73 Reading the verse from Lokasenna in which Loki is said to have been “eight winters . . . beneath the earth, a woman milking cows” as referring to time he spent procuring his own powers of  transformation and deception, Schjødt argues that the blending of  blood with Loki resulted in Ódinn’s becoming “able to control certain of  those skills that Loki had acquired through his stay in the under- world, and in this way he is himself  able to change sex and shape.”74 Thus Ódinn, like Zeus, seems to derive at least part of  his mastery of metic abilities from a commingling of  substance with a more primordial bearer of  such mastery. Because Ódinn’s assimilation of  this power is less than total, however, his reign will be less than permanent, his sover- eignty less than definitive. Ódinn does not imbibe Loki whole, as Zeus does Metis, but merely blends some of  Loki’s bodily fluid into his own, thereby leaving Loki, and the powers he epitomizes, autonomous. And while it is true that what finally does in Ódinn and his allies is the over- whelming show of  force at ragnarök by the giants and monsters that the æsir have long exploited and kept at bay, this defeat in battle is preceded and enabled by a loss of  control over and final breach with Loki. According to Snorri, this occurs when Loki orchestrates the catastrophe that marks 71 The analogous pair of  Ódinn:Zeus::Loki:Prometheus works well if  one takes Aeschylus’s Prometheus vinctus rather than Hesiod as the basis for comparison of  Greek with Norse myth because, as Detienne and Vernant observe, “in Aeschylus’ version, which deliberately ignores the figure of  Metis, Prometheus takes her place and plays the role which Hesiod assigns to the goddess” (Cunning Intelligence, 59). In Aeschylus, metis remains less fully harnessed by Zeus, and his sovereignty depends upon making a deal with Prometheus, who remains his rival in the arena of  cunning intelligence (see the further discussion of  this source in Cunning Intelligence, 58–61, 82–83). Still, the fact remains that even here Zeus’s combination of force and cunning suffices to render his sovereignty permanent, which is not something ever accomplished by Ódinn. 72 See Hesiod, Theogony, West ed., 403; and Vernant, Universe, 27–28. 73 Schjødt, “Om Loki endnu engang,” 56–57, 78–79. 74 “Odin bliver istand til at beherske visse af  de færdigheder, som Loke har fået gennem sit ophold i underverdenen, og således selv kan skifte køn og ham” (ibid., 56). For the quo- tation from Lokasenna, see n. 28 above. Although it does not really effect his point, it may be noted that Schjødt, reading mólcandi as an intransitive verb, takes this verse from Lokasenna to suggest that Loki spent his time in the underworld “partly in the form of  a woman and partly in the form of  a cow” (dels i skikkelse af  en kvinde og dels i skikkelse af  en ko) (“Om Loki endnu engang,” 51–52; see also 52 n. 8). </page> <page sequence="23"> History of Religions 233 the initial step or turning point in the crumbling of  the gods’ order— namely, the killing of  Ódinn’s and Frigg’s son Baldr. Gylfaginning relates near its end how Baldr, earlier described as best and brightest of  the æsir, praised and loved by all, was disturbed by dreams portending his death.75 To prevent their coming to pass, Frigg secured an oath from all things, animate and inanimate, not to harm her son. The gods then amused them- selves by chucking weapons and other normally dangerous objects at the seemingly impervious Baldr, until Loki, having disguised himself  as a woman and learned from Frigg what one thing had not taken the oath, directs Ódinn’s blind son Hödr to throw mistletoe at Baldr, which passes straight through him, striking him dead. Snorri calls this “the greatest misfortune that has been committed among gods and men” and reports that “Ódinn bore this injury worst to the extent that he perceived most what great deprivation and loss was in Baldr’s death for the æsir.”76 Although Hödr, for his part in the deed, is quickly slain by a son of  Ódinn born specially for the purpose, Loki is not immediately seized or punished, because, according to Snorri’s pretty conspicuous rationalization, the place where Baldr was killed is a “gridastadr” (sanctuary).77 Loki is thus able to compound his crime after Hel, his daughter and the ruler of  the eponymous realm of  the dead, agrees to let Baldr return to the lands of the living only “if  all things in the world, living and dead, weep for him.”78 The one entity that refuses to do so is a gygr (a giantess or troll woman) with the strange name of  Êökk (Thanks), whom the æsir find in a cave: “And this men guess, that there has been Loki Laufeyjarson, who has done most evil among the æsir.”79 Finally, the gods capture and punish Loki, binding him to three sharp rocks with the guts of  his son Narfi and enlisting a snake to drip poison on his face: “There he will lie in bonds until ragnarøkr,” the events of  which Snorri immediately recounts.80 Drawing from a number of  poetic sources, he reports that Loki will break free to lead the forces of  destruction, among which are his sons the world-engirdling serpent Jörmungandr, whose spewing poison will kill Êórr, and the wolf  Fenrir, who will swallow Ódinn. Thus, whereas Zeus swallows metis incarnate and thereby makes his regime everlasting, pre- venting the birth of  any progeny clever enough to overthrow him, Ódinn 75 Gylfaginning 22 and 49, Faulkes ed., 23 and 45. 76 “ok hefir Âat mest óhapp verit unnit med godum ok mönnum . . . En Ódinn bar Âeim mun verst Âenna skada sem hann kunni mesta skyn hversu mikil aftaka ok missa Ásunum var í fráfalli Baldrs” (Gylfaginning 49, Faulkes ed., 46). 77 Ibid. 78 “ef  allir hlutir í heiminum, kykvir ok daudir, gráta hann” (Gylfaginning 49, Faulkes ed., 47). 79 “En Âess geta menn at Âar hafi verit Loki Laufeyjarson er flest hefir illt gert med Ásum” (Gylfaginning 49, Faulkes ed., 48). 80 “Êar liggr hann í böndum til ragnarøkrs” (Gylfaginning 49, Faulkes ed., 49). </page> <page sequence="24"> 234 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth ends up being swallowed by the offspring of  the instantiation of  cunning intelligence, whose substance he had incorporated only incompletely. Loki himself  is one of  the last to fall before the world is consumed by fire and sinks into the sea. Thus, Ódinn’s “deal with the devil” appears to end in ruin. If  Loki was a primordial force that Ódinn sought to domesticate in order to establish or sustain his own authority, then his imperfect assimilation of  this power left open the possibility, perhaps the inevitability, that it would betray and destroy him and that which he protected. The story does not end here, however. While Ódinn and Loki are out of  the picture, according to Snorri and Völuspá, the main source for his outline of  cosmic history, from the wreckage of  ragnarök a new world will rise in which Baldr and Hödr, alongside other of  the æsir, will reunite and dwell together in peace and plenty.81 Regardless of  whether this resurrection motif  is considered genuinely pagan or influenced by Christianity, many have argued in light of  it that in Norse eschatology Loki essentially plays Judas to Ódinn’s God-the-Father and Baldr’s Christ. In other words, they suggest that Baldr’s killing ought to be understood as having been engineered by Loki with the assent, perhaps even at the order, of  Ódinn as a sacrifice to renew the cosmos.82 While I agree that the passing of  the current order and the rise of  a new one is presented as a necessary good by the extant mythos, I disagree that Ódinn is meant to have any part in making or any desire in seeing this come to pass. Rather than elevate him nearer to the status of  the providential, self-sacrificing, and omniscient Christian god, I prefer to see Ódinn as a failed Zeus—that is, as a self-interested being who desires but ultimately is unable to render himself  and his regime permanent. In short, I take Snorri at his word when he says that Ódinn was the most dismayed of  the æsir at Baldr’s death and what it por- tended. I do so not because I regard Snorri as a sure witness to northern paganism but because he was a member of  that interest group for which I think extant Norse myths most immediately speak, that of  court poets, 81 Gylfaginning 49, Faulkes ed., 53–54; Völuspá 59–65, Edda, Neckel ed., 14–15. 82 This interpretation has a long history, but some of  its more recent proponents include Ursula Dronke and Yvonne S. Bonnetain: see Dronke, “Völuspá and Sybilline Traditions,” in Latin Culture and Medieval Germanic Europe, ed. Richard North and T. Hofstra, Germania Latina 1 (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1992), 3–24, esp. 15–16; and Poetic Edda, Dronke ed. and trans., 2:53, 94–95 (where she explicitly likens Loki to Judas); Bonnetain, “En er Âetta sá Loki Laufeyjarson, Âá líkadi honum illa, er Baldr sakadi ekki,” in International Scandinavian and Medieval Studies in Memory of Gerd Wolfgang Weber—ein runder Knäuel, so rollt’ es uns leicht aus den Händen, ed. Michael Dallapiazza et al. (Trieste: Edizioni Parnaso, 2000), 73–85, esp. 75–78. Jan de Vries offers a similar view, although he places the sacrifice in the context of  warrior-cult practice, in which it is not the world that is to be resurrected but the initiate; he has some trouble explaining Loki’s place in this mythologized rite (see his “Der Mythos von Balders Tod,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 70 [1955]: 41–60, esp. 58–59). Ström offers an interpretation of  Baldr’s myth similar to that of  de Vries (see Loki, 103–15). </page> <page sequence="25"> History of Religions 235 or hirdskálds. In the final part of  this article, I will explain how and why I have reached this conclusion. myths of kings and myths of poets In The Origins of Greek Thought, Vernant writes that “Greek theogonies and cosmogonies . . . told of  the progressive emergence of  an orderly world. But also, and above all, they were myths of  sovereignty. They exalted the power of  a god who ruled over all the universe. . . . If  the world was no longer given over to instability and confusion, it was be- cause the god no longer had to fight battles against monsters and rivals; his supremacy was now so manifestly assured that no one could ever ques- tion it again.”83 Conceding, however, that this vision of  a world subjugated to the will of  a single, immortal power would have been badly out of  step with the democratic impulses of  the emergent Greek polis and agora, Vernant argues that it has come down to us essentially as a fossil of  Near Eastern and Mycenaean monarchic ideology preserved through oral poetry and ending up in Hesiod and Homer. Such myths thus offer a “memory of the divine king,” “an image that in the Mycenaean age conveyed social realities and corresponded to ritual practices. . . . But in the Greek world it could be no more than a survival.”84 Medieval Scandinavia had no comparable memories of  supreme, cen- tralized sovereignty for its myths to reflect, or else these were far dimmer than for the Greeks. This fact may go some way toward explaining why Ódinn, as a symbol of  sovereign power, is so much less successful than Zeus in absolutizing his regime. In my earlier article on Ódinn (see n. 24 above), I argued that in northern Europe the reality of  kingship as a frag- mented, decentralized, and itinerant institution helps to explain why Ódinn’s myths center around themes of  marginality and transience. Poets too, I argued, had their situation as well as interests reflected in these myths, perhaps to an even greater extent than did kings: since most, and after 900 all, known hirdskálds were Icelanders who plied their trade in the mobile courts of  Scandinavia or the British Isles, they were required by their profession to lead a doubly decentered existence, constantly on the move while remaining far from their native land and their own homes.85 83 Jean-Pierre Vernant, The Origins of Greek Thought (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1982), 108. 84 Ibid., 30, 116. 85 On Icelanders’ monopolization of  court poetry, see Faulkes’s introduction to Edda, Faulkes trans., xii–xiii; Roberta Frank, Old Norse Court Poetry: The Dróttkvætt Stanza, Islandica 42 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1978), 23; Hans Kuhn, Das Dróttkvætt (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1983), 284–85; E.

By this, I do not mean only that it was split (as of course it was) into political, familial, or territorial factions but also that there was a division between, to borrow terminology from the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, holders of  different forms of  capital relevant to success within elite fields of  practice.88 Kings and nobles can be regarded as priv- ileged holders of  material capital (wealth, land, etc.), social capital (net- works of  followers and supporters, foreign alliances, etc.), and symbolic capital (possession of  and power to give titles and other tokens of  worth and recognition), while poets’ expertise enabled them to produce and disseminate a major form of  cultural capital.89 The continued capacity, however, for skalds’ poetry to function as capital—that is, as a resource convertible into material or symbolic benefits—depended upon recogni- tion of  its value by its primary consumers. Thus, the relationship between poets and kings was symbiotic, but it was also potentially antagonistic. I described this relationship in my article on Ódinn as hinging on the fact that “each group had something the other wanted owing to its dominance in one of  two arenas of  experience. Simply put, kings held the edge in 86 Indeed, many who recognize how much we depend on poets for information on Norse myth lament the distorted view of  religion or cult that they have afforded us; e.g., Holtsmark writes that the existing mythos often amounts to “a poet’s fantasy about the gods’ lives[,] . . . or it is a poet’s interpretation of  sacred places and things” (en dikters fantasi over gudenes liv. . . . Eller det er en dikters tolkning av hellige steder og ting) (“Loki—en omstridt skikkelse,” 84), and Schneider argues that because the Loki we know is “a creature of  poetic invention” (ein Geschöpf  dichterischer Erfindung), the only way to discover the “eigentlichen” Loki is to determine which of  his qualities are “vordichterisch” (“Loki,” 238–39). For recent summary accounts of  sources for Norse myth, see Lindow, Norse Mythology, 9–30; and Peter Orton, “Pagan Myth and Religion,” in A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture, ed. Rory McTurk (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2005), 302–19, esp. 306–11. 87 See, e.g., Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes, 1:50 and 103–7. 88 Pierre Bourdieu develops and uses these concepts in all his major works; see esp. Dis- tinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, trans. Richard Nice (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1984); and The Logic of Practice, trans. Richard Nice (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1990). 89 For an extended application of  Bourdieu’s categories and methods to medieval Scandi- navian materials, see Kevin J.

Recognizing this allocation of advantages helps us to understand the essence of  their transactions: kings provided poets with a space in which to operate and prosper, while poets supplied kings with a means to extend their names and reputations in time.”90 Because he was a patron of  kings and poets, Ódinn had the po- tential to symbolize both sides of  this relationship not only in terms of what united them but also in terms of  what divided them. There was thus a potential conflict of  interests posed by his every appearance in myths produced by poets and consumed by rulers. As I argued, the sources tended to try to resolve this conflict in the poets’ favor: in myths of  Ódinn “a certain bias emerges. . . . [The] representative or embodiment of  margin- ality . . . [tends to come] out on top over a representative or . . . victim of ephemerality. . . . In other words, those who lack (initially) control over space [i.e., the court] consistently trump those who lack control over time [i.e., the means of  preserving one’s and others’ memories]. . . . In addition, then, to understanding Ódinn and his career as reflecting the social situation of  poets and kings . . . we may perceive in them something of  a veiled threat or assertion of  superiority directed from the primary producers to the primary consumers of  his myths.”91 In short, Ódinn was a god both of  kings and of  poets, but when a choice had to be made, he was more often depicted as assisting the latter—and very frequently as betraying the former. In turning now to argue that Loki serves in extant sources as a god or symbol more unilaterally aligned than Ódinn with the perspective and interests of  poets, I run up against the obstacle already mentioned— namely, that, as Lindow has put it, “Everyone agrees that there was never any cult of  Loki.”92 If  by “cult” one has in mind a body of  adherents who gather at dedicated sites to rehearse myths about and perform rites directed at specific objects of  veneration, then I think this claim is correct; by call- ing Loki a god of  poets, I do not mean to suggest that skalds actively wor- shipped him or that they consciously and collectively regarded him as a patron or bestower of  benefits. If, after all, one is looking for gods who held such a relationship with or meaning for poets, there are much better candidates: not only Ódinn, who was thought to have seized the art of poetry (in the form of  mead) from the giants and dispensed it to those he found worthy or capable of  versifying, but also Bragi, a minor áss and attendant of  Ódinn in Valhöll and at feasts, who is probably the apoth- eosis of  history’s first known skald, the ninth-century Norwegian Bragi 90 Wanner, “God on the Margins,” 345. 91 Ibid., 349. 92 Lindow, Norse Mythology, 219. </page> <page sequence="28"> 238 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth Boddason.93 It is true that the representation and types of  inspiration that these two gods offered poets could be regarded as incomplete or lopsided. They do not, for example, offer much to the skald who wished to compose or deliver blame. Loki has on occasion been described as playing the role of  blame-poet, or “scold” (a term cognate with Old Norse skáld ) in the gods’ court.94 The only real support for Loki in this role, however, is Loka- senna, in which he castigates—in verse of  course—the gods and god- desses one by one, laying bare their foibles and failings until Êórr arrives and drives him off  with the threat of  violence. If, moreover, this poem is read as a mythical tableau of  blame-poetry’s performance in the court, then it surely illustrates the least successful potential outcome of  this act. Not only do the targets of  the blame refuse to recognize many of  its claims or to rectify their character or behavior accordingly, they also, if  one looks to Lokasenna’s prose epilogue, retaliate against its bearer when they later seize Loki and bind and torture him.95 Even if, then, it is possible to think that Loki in his willingness and ability to berate the king of  the gods and his guests provided aspiring scolds with some inspiration, or at least with a model of  audacity, such poets could hardly have hoped for their efforts to have met with similar results.96 I have, at any rate, something subtler but hopefully more significant in mind when I say that Loki can be regarded as a god of  poets or as a focal point for expression of  the interests of  this group. In my view, Loki is the figure who, on the plane of  myth—of  narrative ideology97—makes the poet’s art have a real purpose and worth. Loki ensures that poetry will serve even among the gods that function which, though I have largely set it aside in my discussion thus far, provides poetry’s central claim to value in all times and places in which it is regarded as more than mere art or pastime: the function of  memorialization. In Snorri Sturluson’s Háttatal (List of  meters, ca. 1220), a monumental joint panegyric for King Hákon Hákonarson and Earl Skúli Bárdarson of  Norway, he boasts that the praise that he has composed for them “will live forever unless humanity passes 93 On the relationship between the historical and the mythical Bragi, see Sigurdur Nordal, Icelandic Culture, trans.

But what of  a divine sovereign, whose life span matches, at least, that of  the present cosmos? What need does he have of memorial praise? Returning for a moment to ancient Greece, I note that Gregory Nagy has described Greek cult and epic alike as forms “of  a cultural institution that is predicated on the natural process of  death.”99 Such a thought is expressed already in Homer’s Odyssey, where we read: “That is the gods’ work, spinning threads of  death through the lives of  mortal men, and all to make a song for those to come.”100 Nagy develops this point further, deriving a corollary pertinent to divinity: “The hero must experience death. The hero’s death . . . gives him his power—not only in cult but also in poetry. . . . Not even the lofty Olympians can match that, since they cannot die.”101 Here at last is an arena in which Ódinn triumphs over Zeus—only Ódinn will die. This is, to be sure, a dubious sort of  prize. For one thing, from a Platonic, Christian, and perhaps even Hesiodic viewpoint, it disqualifies him as a true god—mortal divinity is an oxymoron in such (most?) systems of  thought. Norse myth tellers and mythographers seem, however, to have been less concerned by the contradiction—at least so far as we can judge. Yet even among human heroes and kings it often seems a matter of  uncertainty whether fame and reverence ought to be chosen over, if  not immortality, then a longer life. As Nagy observes, Homer between his two epics has the same character express preference for both choices.102 In the Iliad, Achilles resolutely opts for kléos over nóstos, “fame” over “homecoming”: “If  I hold out here and I lay siege to Troy, my journey home is gone, but my glory never dies. If  I voyage back to the fatherland I love, my pride, my glory dies.”103 In the Odyssey, however, his shade expresses regret at having made this choice: “No winning words about death to me, shining Odysseus! By god, I’d rather slave on earth for another man—some dirt- poor tenant farmer who scrapes to keep alive—than rule down here over all the breathless dead.”104 98 “Âat mun æ lifa nema öld farisk, bragni&lt;n&gt;ga lof, eda bili heimar” (Snorri Sturluson, Háttatal 96, in Edda: Háttatal, ed. Anthony Faulkes [Oxford: Clarendon, 1991], 38). 99 Gregory Nagy, The Best of the Achaeans: Concepts of the Hero in Archaic Greek Poetry (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979), 184 (emphasis in original). 100 Homer, Odyssey, bk. 8, lines 579–80; translation from Homer, The Odyssey, trans.

To judge by his constant efforts to gather intelligence, skills, and forces that might hold off  or even avert ragnarök, it seems clear that he would choose long—or, in his case, immortal—life over a heroic and celebrated end. In short, he would prefer literal to figurative immortality. Ódinn is a ruler who desires to possess true sovereignty, of  the type attained by Zeus in the Theogony: personal, unlimited, and everlasting. He refuses, therefore, to settle for lesser means of  sustaining sovereignty available to mortal kings, for neither the genealogical “immortality” provided by dynastic suc- cession nor the intellectual “immortality” provided by forms of  cultural— above all, poetic—commemoration. Ultimately, however, Ódinn is not permitted to decide his own fate—rather, it is Loki who decides for him. Deciding to get rid of  Ódinn is, moreover, an act that serves clearly to distinguish the two figures, the one deed that Loki, but never Ódinn, can perform. Having made this claim, I am now in a position to complete my response to the question posed in the previous section, namely, “If  Ódinn, then why Loki?” or, to put it another way, In what factor or quality does the significant difference between these two mythic figures lie? My answer is that, simply, it lies in the relationship between the two as actors in the mythic world, in which the crucial difference between them is rank, or the legitimate possession of  authority, which Ódinn has and Loki lacks. Ódinn’s rank, or power, clearly does not insulate him from accusations of  perfidy or selfishness; from the perspective of  those within as well as those outside the myths, he is often seen as a deceiver and betrayer. Yet the fact that no one is ranked above him in the Norse cosmos gives his actions a certain de facto, if  not de jure, justification and legitimacy. It hardly matters that Ódinn’s position at the top of  the hierarchy is recog- nized by the sources as contingent and thus as precarious. Accordingly, as Bourdieu reminds us, power can always be understood as “legitimate imposture,” as the result of  a misrecognition of  arbitrary conditions as natural.105 Thus our sources for Norse myth might be admired for their relatively clear-sighted perception of  the nature of  authority. What does matter is that since Ódinn is positioned there, or so long as he is, his interests stand the best chance of  being (mis)recognized as universal interests. By preserving himself, Ódinn can claim to preserve that which he rules and those who identify with him and that order. Ódinn may betray or deceive other sovereigns—whether of  the human or the giant realms— 105 Pierre Bourdieu, Language and Symbolic Power, ed. John B. Thompson, trans.

Richard Nice (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000), 242–43. </page> <page sequence="31"> History of Religions 241 but Loki in turning on Ódinn betrays sovereignty itself  or at least that entity who most aspires to attain, and comes nearest to attaining, the status of  ideal sovereignty. It is from this perspective, as a betrayer of  some- thing that sits higher than himself, that Loki can be or was perceived as more “evil” or “malicious” or “perverted” than Ódinn, I contend. It is probably also for this reason that the term læ, with its three core meanings of  “cunning,” “betrayal,” and “injury,” is so often associated with Loki but not with Ódinn (although we should not discount the equally compel- ling demands of  alliteration in poetry). It is crucial to recognize, however, that Loki’s betrayal of  Ódinn is far from a wholly negative act or set of  actions, particularly from the vantage point of  poets and their interests. Although Loki engineers Ódinn’s per- sonal downfall, he is also the figure most responsible for securing for Ódinn both of  the forms of  compensatory “immortality” with which those who fail—or who, being mortal, must fail—in their efforts to attain true or absolute sovereignty have to make do. In short, it is Loki who ensures both that Ódinn has an heir to succeed and remember him and that there is something about him that is worth remembering. Stated generally, these are the three conditions—someone that is gone, something about that someone to be remembered, and someone to remember it—required for poetry to function as vehicle of  memorialization. Indeed, the impor- tance of  court poets and their products hinged on the interruption of  sov- ereignty and the succession of  generations—for if  a king never dies and is never succeeded, then there is nothing that needs commemorating. These points apply especially to skaldic verse as it was practiced in medieval courts. While those who discuss skaldic poetry, myself  included, like to emphasize (and occasionally bemoan) its rigid meter and stereo- typed forms of  expression, it is wrong to characterize its content as generic or nonspecific. As Anatoly Liberman observes, skalds typically were concerned to communicate the “concrete fact.”106 Their poetry was, to rework a famous phrase of  Claude Lévi-Strauss, an “art of  the con- crete”;107 it recorded and celebrated (or, less often, decried) specific things done by specific actors at specific times and places. This is one reason why skaldic poems, particularly court poems, can be of  so little interest to modern audiences. Such verse characteristically spoke to nothing beyond its context of  production and delivery. Any relevance it was expected to have in the future, and thus the worth it was accorded in the present of  its 106 Anatoly Liberman, “The Formulaic Mind and the Skalds,” in Word Heath, Wortheide, Ordheidi, 51. 107 Lévi-Strauss refers many times to primitive or mythic thought as a “science of  the con- crete”; see, e.g., Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Savage Mind (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 1962), 16. </page> <page sequence="32"> 242 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth producer and first auditors, depended on the expectation that an audience would continue to exist who considered it important to recall this originary context. Skaldic court poetry’s value, therefore, lay not chiefly in aesthetics or flattery but in its capacity to commemorate. And for this value to hold, in the long run or short term, its subjects must die, or be expected to. Returning to Loki and Ódinn, we see the former securing for the latter an heir in the person of  Baldr. Baldr, as many have noted, is a remark- ably colorless and passive figure with only one real myth to his name, in which his role is basically to show up, die, and come back. As I stated above, I disagree with those who understand Baldr as an “Odinic” sacri- fice or who consider Loki complicit in Ódinn’s plans to renew or restore the cosmos. One fact that speaks against their interpretation is that when Baldr is killed, he goes to Hel rather than to Valhöll.108 Valhöll is the afterlife site where men chosen either through sacrifice or through death in battle go to await ragnarök, when they will become Ódinn’s army.109 Baldr, however, is trapped in the realm of  the dead that Ódinn does not control and that is ruled by Loki’s daughter. That Loki intended to place and keep Baldr here is indicated by the words (probably taken from a lost eddic poem) that he speaks to the æsir while in the form of  Êökk: “haldi Hel Âví er hefir” (Let Hel hold what she has).110 While this outcome dis- tresses the æsir, and especially Ódinn, it effectively keeps Baldr from having to take part in the cataclysmic battles of  ragnarök, in which Val- höll’s residents will all perish (this is, admittedly, not a new experience for them, but this time it will be for real) along with the major gods. Baldr too, then, has, like Loki, at least one vital mythological function to per- form: he must survive and succeed Ódinn by making the transition to the new world.111 That he does so is due to the choices and actions of  Loki. 108 De Vries admits to having difficulty making this datum fit his theory that the myth of Baldr’s death symbolizes initiation into a warrior cult (see his “Der Mythos von Balders Tod,” 60 n. 1). 109 Gylfaginning 20 and 38–41, Faulkes ed., 21 and 32–34. 110 Gylfaginning 49, Faulkes ed., 48; translation from Edda, Faulkes trans., 51. 111 Gro Steinsland has argued that Baldr himself  ought to be regarded as the major symbol in Norse myth of  kings’ fated transience: “Baldr’s death is a projection of  the kings’ death and, therefore, in the end, a projection of  the fateful relations that govern the world. . . . Baldr’s death constitutes the mythical model for the king’s death” (Balders død er en projeksjon av kongenes død og dermed i siste hånd en projeksjon av de skjebnemessige forhold som styrer verden. . . . Balders død danner den mytiske modell for kongens død) (Det hellige bryllup og norrøn kongeideologi: En analyse av hierogami-myten i “Skírnismál,” “Ynglingatal,” “Hályegjatal” og “Hyndluljód” [Oslo: Solum Forlag, 1991], 236, 261). Steinsland does not, however, address how Baldr’s being slated to return from death fits in with her theory. Clunies Ross sees this myth as symbolizing a dynastic crisis, one in which it is Loki’s role to find a “means of  destroying the dominant line of  succession” among the æsir (Prolonged Echoes, 276; see also 268–77). In my view, Loki does not destroy or arrest but, rather, acti- vates or realizes succession. </page> <page sequence="33"> History of Religions 243 The sources also assign Loki responsibility for ensuring that once Ódinn is gone there will be something about him worth remembering. As medi- eval and modern commentators on Norse myth (not to mention its many characters who experience or hear reports of  the chief  god’s exploits) affirm, while many of  Ódinn’s deeds are memorable, there is little in his career of  which he ought to be proud. It is perhaps for this reason that memories of  Ódinn that are said to survive ragnarök are rather limited. In Snorri’s Edda, Baldr and the other reborn gods “all sit down together” in a land that has risen on its own and ordered itself  “and [they] talk with each other and remind themselves of  their rúnar [mysteries or runes] and talk about those happenings that once had occurred, about the Midgards- ormr and about Fenrisúlfr.”112 Or, as Völuspá puts it, they “talk about the mighty earth-encircler, and there remind themselves about great events, and about Fimbultyr’s [Ódinn’s] old rúnar.”113 According to these reports, Baldr’s and his companions’ reminiscences in the resurrected world focus on two topics. The first is knowledge that had been accumulated by the old world’s ruler; this might be thought to have been transmitted partly by Ódinn himself, in the words that he whispered in Baldr’s ear when his son lay on his funeral pyre.114 The other topic centers around the circum- stances of  the demise of  the old king and his allies which, like the act of killing and sequestering Baldr in Hel, are to be ascribed largely to Loki. Not only did Loki lead the force of  jötnar that makes the final assault on the gods’ home, but, according to Völuspá in skamma (Short Völuspá) he also gave birth to all the worlds’ giantesses and thus can be accounted a literal progenitor of  this army.115 At any rate, two of  his immediate off- spring, and the only two figures mentioned as explicit objects of  memory in the post-ragnarök world, were the direct agents of  Ódinn’s and Êórr’s deaths. Even, then, in the new world from which he is absent, Loki remains the sagna hrœrir, the “rouser of  tales.” Finally, there is a figure who, though I have yet to mention him, will help to round out my argument that myths that center around Ódinn and Loki’s relationship and its eschatological climax are reflective of  poets’ interests. This is Hœnir, another “enigmatic god” whose one indisputable 112 “Setjask Âá allir samt ok talask vid ok minnask á rúnar sínar ok rœda of  tídindi Âau er fyrrum höfdu verit, of  Midgardsorm ok um Fenrisúlf” (Gylfaginning 53, Faulkes ed., 53–54). 113 “Finnaz æsir á Idavelli oc um moldÂinur, mátcan, dœma, oc minnaz Âar á megindóma oc á Fimbultys fornar rúnar” (Völuspá 60, in Edda, Neckel ed., 14). 114 VafÂrúdnismál 54, in Edda, Neckel ed., 55. 115 “vard Loptr qvidugr af  kono illri, padan er á foldo flagd hvert komit” (Loptr was impregnated by an evil woman, from whence is come every giantess [or ogress, or witch] on the earth) (Hyndluljód [Völuspá in skamma is part of  this poem]) 41, in Edda, Neckel ed., 294). </page> <page sequence="34"> 244 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth quality is his “close connection” to both Ódinn and Loki.116 This trio appears as traveling companions in two myths, that of  the giant Êjazi’s theft of  the goddess Idunn and that of  Otr’s ransom, which forms a pre- lude to the Völsung legend.117 Hœnir does very little in either of  these stories (though the same could be said of  Ódinn), but many references to him emphasize his relationship to Loki and/or Ódinn. Among the ken- nings for Loki that appear in Êjódólfr’s Haustlöng (ca. 900), our main source for the story of  Idunn’s theft and one of  the oldest extant sources for Norse myth generally, are “vinr Hœnis,” “hollr vinr Hœnis,” and “hugreynandi Hœnis” (Hœnir’s friend, Hœnir’s loyal friend, trier of Hœnir’s courage); it may also be noted that Hœnir is not among the æsir castigated by Loki in Lokasenna.118 In his Edda, Snorri states that while most of  the æsir may be referred to as “sonr Ódins” (Ódinn’s son), Loki and Hœnir can each be called “sinni eda sessi Ódins” (Ódinn’s comrade or table-companion), while the latter is “máli Ódins” (Ódinn’s confidante).119 One gets the sense from these kennings that Loki and Hœnir come the nearest among the æsir to being accounted Ódinn’s peers and that Hœnir was especially privy to Ódinn’s knowledge or experiences. Accepting scholars’ equation of  Lódurr with Loki, we also find this trio acting together in Völuspá to create man and woman from two logs found on the seashore. Each of  the three gods provides the first human pair with some vital endowment: “önd gaf  Ódinn, ód gaf  Hœnir, lá gaf Lódurr oc lito góda.”120 There is least agreement on how to understand the gifts given by Lódurr: many suggest something like “craft” (or, alterna- tively, “blood” or “vital warmth”) for lá and “good color” or “good looks” for lito góda; at any rate, these terms seem to have to do with qualities or functions of  the body rather than of  the intellect or soul.121 Ódinn’s bequest of  önd is usually translated as “spirit” or “breath” and may refer to an animating principle.122 Ódr, Hœnir’s gift, can (like önd ) be translated as “spirit” or “soul” but also as “inspiration,” “frenzy,” “ecstasy,” or other terms conveying a sense of  high mental excitement. Some think it stands 116 Lindow, Norse Mythology, 179, 180. As Lindow describes this god, s.v. “Hœnir,” much of  the scholarship on him has revolved around attempting, mainly on the basis of  a few lines from Skáldskaparmál, to establish his identity with some variety of  bird, such as a stork, crane, or rooster. 117 The myth of  Êjazi’s theft is known from Haustlöng and Skáldskaparmál G56, Faulkes ed., 1–3; for references to the story of  Otr’s ransom, see n. 32 above. 118 Haustlöng 3, 7, and 12, North ed., 2, 4, and 6. 119 Skáldskaparmál 4–5, 8–13 (for sons of  Ódinn), and 15–16 (for Hœnir and Loki), Faulkes ed., 14, 17, and 19–20. 120 Völuspá 18, in Edda, Neckel ed., 5. 121 Schjødt, “Om Loki endnu engang,” 59. 122 For önd translated as “breath,” see de Vries, Problem of Loki, 29; on its identity as an animating principle, see Poetic Edda, Dronke ed. and trans., 2:123. </page> <page sequence="35"> History of Religions 245 for the idea of  a higher soul that survives death and that humans do not share with lower life forms.123 However one translates ódr in this verse, it has been thought strange that Hœnir, and not Ódinn, is the one to supply humans with this quality— ódr is, after all, the root word of  Ódinn’s name. An answer to this puzzle may be suggested through a consideration of  Hœnir’s second appearance in Völuspá. Near the poem’s end, three gods are identified as reappearing after ragnarök: Baldr, Hödr, and Hœnir.124 Hœnir’s presence here has also puzzled many, since if  one considers those gods named as survivors in Völuspá alongside those given in another eddic poem, VafÂrúdnismál (Say- ings of  VafÂrúdnir), which lists Ódinn’s sons Vídarr and Váli and Êórr’s sons Módi and Magni, then Hœnir is the only one who is not a member of the younger generation of  gods—on the contrary, he dates to the origins of  the previous cosmic order.125 As Lindow observes, it is ordinarily the second generation of  the æsir “whose actions span this world and the next,” while “the major gods of  the Odinic world are not to survive but are to be replaced.”126 Perhaps this is why Hœnir is omitted from the combined list of  survivors in Gylfaginning.127 Hœnir’s reappearance at the end of Völuspá may be connected, however, to his association earlier in the poem with ódr, which has, in addition to those translations given above, another, more concrete sense. As Ström writes, “In poetry, ódr is above all an expression for the poet’s gift; more concretely expressed, it is the poem itself, the composed product.”128 Since, then, neither Ódinn nor, presumably, his mead of  poetry will pass over into the new world, it makes sense that some part of  the power of  poetic art and inspired wisdom re- main separate from or invested in a figure other than Ódinn, one who will be able or permitted to make the transition to the new world. Viewed in this light, Hœnir stands in the same relationship to Ódinn in terms of  the powers of  ódr as Loki does in terms of  the powers of  metic or cunning intelligence. Each is a primordial and independent instantia- tion of  one of  his key attributes, hardly distinguishable from him until the 123 De Vries understands ódr to refer to “mental faculties of  a higher order, such as poetic genius, ecstasy” (Problem of Loki, 29; here citing his Contributions to the Study of Othin, Folklore Fellows Communications 94 [Helsinki: Suomalainen tiedeakatemia, 1931], 30–31). On ódr as that “which does not die, but is continually renewed in another life,” see Poetic Edda, Dronke, ed. and trans., 2:124. 124 Völuspá 62–63, in Edda, Neckel ed., 15. 125 VafÂrúdnismál 51, in Edda, Neckel ed., 54–55. 126 John Lindow, Murder and Vengeance among the Gods: Baldr in Scandinavian Myth- ology, Folklore Fellows Communications 227 (Helsinki: Suomalainen tiedeakatemia, 1997), 145. 127 Gylfaginning 53, Faulkes ed., 53–54 128 “In der Poesie is der ódr vor allem ein Ausdruck für die Dichtergabe, konkreter ausge- drückt ist er das Gedicht selbst, das gedichtete Produkt” (Ström, Loki, 56). </page> <page sequence="36"> 246 Cunning Intelligence in Norse Myth time comes to accomplish a purpose that he cannot. The king must die, while the source or muse of  poetic inspiration must live on. Because Ódinn cannot do both, Hœnir takes up the latter role. He satisfies the condition that even though Ódinn cannot be immortal, ódr must be. A last datum concerning Hœnir that may be illuminated by this interpretation of  his character or function is that in Ynglinga saga he is handed over to the vanir in an exchange of  hostages along with another áss, Mímir, whose name relates to terms for “memory.”129 The vanir make Hœnir a chieftain, but they soon discover that unless Mímir is with him he never says anything other than “Let others decide.”130 Feeling cheated, the vanir cut off  Mímir’s head and send it to Ódinn, who embalms it and consults it for wisdom; the saga does not report what becomes of  Hœnir. This story reveals Hœnir, like any good praise-poet or conveyer of  the power of  ódr, to be little more than memory’s mouthpiece. My analysis has thus led me to conclude that Folke Ström was not far off  the mark when he argued that many figures of  Norse myth can be regarded as offshoots of  various qualities of  Ódinn—for most purposes even as interchangeable with this god. I would yet emphasize that how- ever close these figures approach to identity with Ódinn, each has at least one proper and vital function to fulfill in the myths. Ódinn’s purpose is to die and to be remembered. Hœnir’s is to allow that memory to be con- veyed across the worlds or generations. Baldr’s is to remain and remember. And Loki’s is to make sure it all happens. It is from this perspective that I have argued that Loki can be understood as a god of  poets. If  the Theogony is at its core a myth of  kings, a myth in which sovereignty becomes the permanent possession of  an unimpeachable, ideal ruler, then the stories that center around Loki might be read as relating a myth of  poets, one that insists on the inevitability, even among the gods, of sovereignty’s loss and transmission, and thus on the universal need for agents and instruments of  memorialization.
