<plain_text><page sequence="1">Transgressive Rituals: Constructing the Santera's Body in the Photography of María Pérez Bravo Mariana Bolívar Rubín University of Colorado at Boulder Life in heaven cannot be pleasant, otherwise people could not live so long and come back so quickly. Yoruba proverb The body can be regarded as a kind of hinge or threshold: it is placed between the psychic of a lived interiority and a more sociopolitical exteriority that produces interiority though the inscription of the body's outer surface. Elizabeth Grosz, Space, Time, and Perversion Docile bodies have long been objects of cultural, philosophical, and religious fascination; while, unfortunately, still maintaining their status as objects of intervention, reflection, or training. To rethink the body beyond docility implies the manner in which we think of subjectivity itself. Not an easy task, one which philosophers, cultural critics, and artists are more often embarking upon. The body as a particular site of subjectivity is a major concern in the photography of María Pérez Bravo. Pérez Bravo's work explores the representation of the female body within the symbolic system of Santería, and articulates an unthought of discursive space: the body of the santera. Pérez Bravo portrays santeras—female practitioners of Santería—as objects of fascination, and at the same time, she constructs a somatic imaginary that questions their location within Santeria's symbolic system. Santería, as well as many other syncretic religions, has functioned and continues to function as a site of resistance against eurocentric hegemonic discourses. Santería has its roots in African spiritual Yoruba traditions, which were brought to the Caribbean by African slaves, and were then diversified in the Americas as Santería, or Regla de Ocha, Ifá, and Candomble in Brazil. The similarity between Santería and Catholicism relies almost solely on re-naming African deities with the names of Catholic saints. This definition poses Santería as a counterpart of Catholicism, thus disregarding the trangressive power of discursive difference. The present study will consider Santería not as a cultural fusion of two religious systems, but rather as a site of organic resistance. Afro-Hispanic Review • Volume 31, Number 1 • Spring 2012 ~ 61</page><page sequence="2">Mariana Bolívar Rubín Santerías practices reappropriate a hegemonic religious discourse in order to apply it to the Afro-Caribbean lived experience, thus disrupting long established body/mind dichotomies. Gender binaries are still too often manipulated in order to establish hierarchical distinctions in Santeria's discursive realm. Pérez Bravo's construction of the gendered body draws attention to two aspects of ritual performance: interpretation and sacrifice. During the rituals of interpretation, the body appears as a fixed site of enunciation, while sacrificial performances display the plasticity of the subject's formation. By fetishizing the mutilated santera—her own body—Pérez Bravo constructs a space of enunciation and creatively transforms Santeria's discursive realm. Hence, it can be argued that Pérez Bravo's photography is a form of organic resistance that counters Santeria's gender hegemony. Born in Havana, Cuba, Pérez Bravo is considered a notable representative of the Latin American genre of fotografía construida, or constructed photography. This genre looks at the photograph as a carefully composed document. Luis Camnitzer, in his book New Art of Cuba, describes Pérez Bravo's constructed photography as a process of thought in which concepts and ideas are formalized within the parameters of a photographic frame (103). These photographs reconstruct the santera's body through excluding frames, mutilated body parts, and prosthetics. The female subject (Pérez Bravo herself) floats in an undefined space, and the decapitation and missing limbs generate a sense of incompleteness. Furthermore, her unconstrained spatial location, as well as her mutilated body, point to the notion of a decentered subjectivity. The artist's images work on two levels simultaneously: she seeks social and political recognition of women's bodies existing within a particular context (the "exterior," as my epigraph from Grosz suggests), and she also rejects her position as a complete self (as Grosz's emphasis on "interiority" suggests). In Pérez Bravo's photography, subjectivation can be seen as a process of ongoing production that relies on its own portrayal. Although the santera's subject is constituted somatically by means of her social engravings, her body does not function as a site of external regulation and constraint, but rather as an intensified space of agency and activity. Santería and Gender: Challenging Mind/Body Binaries In her book, Where Men are Wives and Mothers Rule, Mary Ann Clark explores gender issues in the philosophy and practice of the Orisha tradition in the Americas, and in particular Cuban Santería. Clark argues that gender roles in African Yoruba tradition are flexibly signified through the imaginary of ambiguous deities, initiation practices where devotees—regardless of gender, sex, or sexual identification—are always subjected to female roles during the performance of some rites. Clark carefully 62 ~ AHR</page><page sequence="3">Transgressive Rituals distinguishes between the traditional Yoruba representations of gender in Nigeria and the Yoruba religion in the Americas (Santería in Cuba) when addressing the history of the colonial and postcolonial influences of western religious and philosophical thought. Nevertheless, she maintains that Santería has preserved much of the Yoruba tradition with regard to gender representations, and continues to work on the philosophical and theological bases that counter Judeo-Christian and Greek philosophy. According to Clark, Santería counters the western "nature" of deity, the anthropomorphous as well as omnipotent and unknowable god of some Enlightenment thinkers, such as Kant and Hegel. However, similar to western notions of God, Santeria's main god is also an abstraction, but lacking anthropomorphic identifications. Santeria's Ashé is described as a "vital power," and is understood as an energy that stimulates the cosmos toward completeness. However, this god is manifested in the material world through imperfect means. These manifestations are the Orisha, or deities that are present in everyday life. Clark explains: In Yoruba and Santería the cosmological view Ashé, the energy of the universe, is not homogeneous; it collects and forms into nodes of power we recognize as forces of nature (wind, the ocean, thunder), power sites (rivers, mountains), and aspects of human life (our roles as mothers, kings, warriors). (12) Although in Santería these forces have been anthropomorphized and mythologized, most Orishas have ambiguous characters and personalities, thus diverging from the dualistic perception of the good and evil of the Judeo-Christian tradition. In patakis (stories in Lucumi), one can encounter the dual but not radically opposed identities of Orishas; such is the case of Obatalá, who is deemed as the creator, the possessor of light, and the most moral of all Orishas. But, also attributed to Obatalá, is the character of a drunk and irresponsible deity. As the story recounts, Obatalá gets drunk while creating some human beings, hence explaining physical deformations. With regards to gender differentiation, Santería still maintains to some degree the western dichotomies of spirit/body in the sense of the exclusion of the female body from certain ontological positions that articulate social representations. When looking at female subjectivity in the religious context of Santería, it is useful to consider the ritual of the Asiento (priest/priestess's initiation ritual). In these initiations, the priest or priestess becomes socially authorized to hold ritual performances. In Santería, while priestesses are able to perform the majority of religious rituals, such as singing songs to Osain (deity of herbs), participating in initiation rituals, consulting the Orichas, divining with coconut oracles or cowrie shells, and sacrificing animals, they are excluded almost entirely from performing the AHR ~ 63</page><page sequence="4">Mariana Bolívar Rubín Ifá, a kind of divination performed only by the priesthood of Orula, also called Babalawos. Michel Atwood Manson describes Ifá as a "divination system used by Babalawos. ... Ifá describes the knowledge of the invisible and visible world" (128). Ifá as a form of higher divination holds authority in the interpretation of social reality. Ifá is a type of exalted divination in the domain of Santería, where Babalaivos are endowed with a status that is denied to santera women. By being excluded from this kind of social recognition, santeras are unable to create images of self representation. Photography and Rituality: Constructed Modes of Enunciation An aspect of Santería that counters the Western dualism of good and evil, and by extension, of mind and body, is the emphasis in Santería of praxis over doxa. The conception of afterlife by Yoruba is grounded in the understanding that heaven is a place of transition, to which a soul goes only for a short period of time in order to reincarnate in the family line. The concept of transcending the material world in the Judeo-Christian sense does not exist in the Yoruba tradition. The relationship between deities and humans is fundamentally a material one; Orishas are approached by means of body performances or rituals, while at the same time Orishas act on the body of the devotee. Considering Foucault's notion of power knowledge, rituals are performances of cultural representation, and hence they embody a form of power given by social recognition. In Santería, rituals are social performances through which traditional images of cultural representations are maintained, thus ritual performances provide religious knowledge. In this manner, Manson recounts the Guerreros initiation ritual of George Caster, an Aleyo (in Lucumi language this signifies a serious religious student), who, through the performing of initiation rites, transgresses his own conception of the individual body as he connects his body with lived experiences grounded on Santeria's social knowledge. When performing the body in unfamiliar gestures, dances and sounds, the Aleyo enunciates his subjectivity as a student of ceremonies respected within this social realm. Manson, on bodily experiences in initiation rites, argues: People do leam this religion through the exegesis of important concepts, but they learn primarily through observation and enactment. Because learning centers on practice and entering actively into this tradition, the body naturally emerges as central to any analysis of this kind of ritual The body exists in a complex relationship with social knowledge and interpretation. The informal learning style of Santería makes social knowledge a kind of esoteric power. People who know certain ceremonies exercise power in the community. (31) 64 ~ AHR</page><page sequence="5">Transgressive Rituals Because Santería cosmology and practice seem to exist outside the normalizing hegemony of Judeo-Christian and western epistemology, ethnographic discourses have considered the Santería body of ethnic knowledge inferior. However, when considering the social significance of Santería rituals, one has to understand this discursive site and its production of knowledge as counter-hegemonic practice. The transformative character of Santería hinges on the performances of the body during certain religious ceremonies. The photograph, "Los Cantos Mandan," (Fig. 1) exposes what the santeras body is and what her body can do. If, as Foucault argues, knowledge is the consequence of bodies' performances, this knowledge is not always repressive, but can also be affirmative, enabling bodies to act, and acting is expanding of the body. The santera's body performs in its place within the structure of the ritual itself, overcoming itself, and becoming subject. •0* Figure 1. "Los Cantos Mandan" Fraser Gallery The body itself is a site of subjectivity, since religious knowledge—hence social knowledge—is attained through the practitioner's body. In this manner, Santería counters western notions of subject formation that assume that subjectivation occurs through repressive or exclusionary technologies to control the body within a social space. Among Santería practitioners, the acquiring of religious knowledge transcends colonized, racialized and gendered locations. Pérez Bravo's photographs underline the significance of ritual performances in the representation of the Afro-Cuban female body when attaining not only a religious knowledge, but also a social one. The photograph, "Los Cantos Mandan," explores Pérez Bravo's fixed sexual coding as an opening to "becoming"—an enunciatory subject when making the ritual tool an extension of her body. In Santería, objects that are used in the rituals are infused with the power of the Orishas. In this picture, the empty bowls represent the ofrendas, the offerings to the Orishas that connect the divine with the human. The artist squats and claps to praise the Orishas, and her legs are covered with the same material of the bowls: clay. The santera's clay-covered legs can he seen as a physical extension of her body onto the bowl; thus her body is embodied with the same power as the ritual tools. The artist's subject position is given by the social recognition of the bowls,/body as tools of power within Santeria's practicing community. AHR ~ 65</page><page sequence="6">Mariana Bolívar Rubín Ritual and Sacrifice: Compromising Multiple Subjectivities In Santería, ritualism places the individual in ceremonies that allow for subject positions to form, because they acquire social knowledge through didactic performances. But, at the same time, the acquired social knowledge requires a subject position to be modified. For example, during the Cowrie ritual of throwing and interpreting seashells, the client has to submit to the Orishas's desires in order to receive blessings or good fortune. During the ritual, the priest or priestess evokes the multiple subjectivity of the client in order to "reconceptualize" him/her by separating him or her from internalized social performances. In a sense, it is a kind of sacrifice in which the client is devoid of their constructed subjectivity. Nevertheless, divination requires considering individual aspects of the client for interpretation to take place. In a similar manner, the diviner has to compromise his or her identity with the identity of the client, as well as with the Orisha's identity (Manson 32). Thus, ritual performances consist of the sacrifice or transformation of «s Figure 2. "Cultos Paralelos" Fraser Gallery the believers' constituted subjectivities, as well as the priests/priestesses's, in order to enter Santeria's social realm. Sacrifice is definitely a major concern in Pérez Bravo's work. In the photograph "Cultos Paralelos," (Fig. 2) the artist bends down and places her breasts inside sacrificial bowls, where the blood of animals are poured for offerings to the Orishas. This photograph was taken recently, after the artist had twins. In this image the subjective location of the artist as a woman, represented by the sexuality of her naked breasts, is given in sacrifice in order to attain the blessings of motherhood, especially considering the birth of her twins, as the ibeji (twins in Lucumi) in Santería tradition, are revered. Here the artist sacrifices and/or negotiates her womanhood and her motherhood. In order to receive the blessing of motherhood, one has to modify the socially fixed identification of female body and its completeness and particularity. Motherhood expands the boundaries of the constructed body to include an "other" inside oneself, while womanhood maintains the singularity of the material body, through its sensuousness. Thus, sacrifice appears as a transforming event where a given identification can be negotiated creatively through contingent corporal inscriptions. In the photograph entitled "Nunca me abandona I," (Fig. 3) the artist depicts herself offering part of her body, her hair, to an Orisha. Considering Pérez Bravo's 66 ~ AHR</page><page sequence="7">Figure 3. "Nunca me abandona I" Fraser Gallery Transgressive Rituals attention to the body as a location of subjectivity, performances of mutilation can be seen as a process of ritualistic becoming; that is to say a transformative event, in which an identity or identities are being negotiated. In the initiation called el cuchillo, women are entitled to sacrifice larger animals, thus embodying the transgressive and aggressive position appointed in many societies to males. In this sacrificial ceremony, santera women transgress their female subject position when performing socially constituted masculine "aggressive Figure 3. behavior." Let us return to Clark's study about Yoruba "Nunca me abandons I" tradition, since she observes initiation rituals with gender Fraser Gallery issues in mind. She establishes that, at all levels of initiation, the devotee is designated under the female role. According to the designation, the initiator is called iyawo in Lucumi, meaning "wife, younger than the speaker" (35). The priest and priestesses are crowned under a particular Orisha, with whom he or she shares a character trait, regardless of gender designations. Furthermore, during possessions or trances, the devotee acquires and performs characteristics and behaviors particular to his or her Orisha, independent of gender differences. In the work entitled "Mbele," (Fig. 4) the sacrificial I knife is an extension of Perez Bravo's arm. The social I knowledge that sacrifice prescribes in the body empowers the santera with the possibility to expand her own body beyond a I sexual coding. While the knife is part of her body, it is also an I external projection—a deformation—self-imposed on her I female body as it seeks to embody an otherwise understood I male performance. Flere female and male subjectivities I intertwine, provoking a symbolic paradox. Figure 4. "Mbele" Fetishizing the Female Body: Imagining Santerfa's Fraser Gallery Gender Boundaries In correspondence with Clark's readings of the plasticity of gender roles in African Yoruba tradition, Perez Bravo's work portrays the contingency and fluidity of gender boundaries during many of Santerfa's rituals. Her motifs are founded on teleological notions that highly emphasize the materiality of those ritual practices. Such performances become the main concern for the photographer, enabling a representation of the Santera's body as an active site in constant interaction with the ceremonial content. AHR ~ 67 Figure 4. "Mbele" Fraser Gallery</page><page sequence="8">Mariana Bolívar Rubín Nevertheless, it is crucial to consider to what extent one can fall into the seductive argument of idealizing the "Other." Clark's observation of Yoruba performances as gender transgressions could become, for the western reader, no more than another fetish. In the essay "Subversive Body Acts," from her book Gender Trouble, Judith Butler formulates—with a psychoanalytic twist—a notion of identification as an "enacted fantasy," and argues that although desire is historically produced, it becomes embodied through enactments (171). These enactments are performative, as they continuously repeat themselves as a means of establishing identity. Butler, targeting heterosexual identification, explains: . . . acts, gestures, and desire produce the effect of the internal core or substance, but produce this on the surface of the body, through the play of signifying absences that suggest, but never reveal, the organizing principle of identity as a cause. Such acts, gestures, enactments, generally constructed, are performative in the sense that the essence or identity that they otherwise purport to express are fabrications manufactured and sustained through corporeal signs and other discursive means. (173) If one is to consider all identity as the product of fantastic enactments, the ritualistic performances of Santería are no more than the contingency of a particular group of individuals fixated on fabricated ethnic and racial discourses. From this perspective, Santerías practices are not far removed from heterosexual performances in western societies, as both are an effect of psychic yearning for identification. As Miguel Barnet expresses: The culture that the African constructed in Cuba was entirely a defensive one. . . . The culture of the African is revolutionary by nature; it is a method of inward liberation and a way of seeking security. Prayer, revelation, spells, dance, rituals, are directed towards finding salvation. (278) When considering Santeria's socio-historical location—so violently in correspondence with an ongoing tradition of slavery, colonial domination, and post-colonial supremacy—identity can be understood as more that a psychic desire; it can be also understood as a tool for material, as well as symbolic, survival through the reorganization of libidinal structures. Thus, a certain imaginary or fetishistic identification is present in Santería, but it ceases to be a perverse identification in western terms and becomes a site of resistance that arises from the concrete experience of the colonized body. The colonial other, a fetish in and of itself, transgresses her or his position of "Otherness" by attaining a subjectivity grounded in a socially constructed material presence. Santería is more than a syncretic religion; it is an organic, corporeally grounded discourse that resists over-identification with hegemonic theological systems. Santeria's practicioners proceed resiliently—through performances—to portray their own identitary investments. Santería is not less or more powerful, not less ideal or 68 ~ AHR</page><page sequence="9">Transgressive Rituals demonic, than the desire for the heterosexual identification of a white male. However, Santerías transgressive fetishism embraces a counter-hegemonic discourse that de-essentializes the rhetoric of colonizing powers. From this perspective, the fascination with the body one observes in Santeria's rituals is a form of organic resistance. Organic resistance takes place when a subaltern "Other" utilizes the same objectifying discourse that places him or her in a certain position, and does so in order to attain a creative subjectivity. Given the locality of the Other, this appropriation of the dominant discourse is always a misappropriation that inevitably generates a different one. In Prison Notebooks, Antonio Gramsci speaks of counter-hegemonic discourse as an enunciation that arises from a given material location. When discussing the relation between "conjectural" and "organic" historical movements, Gramsci argues: Organic phenomena . . . give rise to socio-historical criticism, whose subject is wider social groupings—beyond the public figures and beyond the top leaders. When an historical period comes to be studied, the great importance of this distinction becomes clear. A crisis occurs, sometimes lasting for decades. This exceptional duration means that incurable structural contradictions have revealed themselves (reached maturity), and that, despite this, the political forces which are struggling to conserve and defend the existing structure itself are making every effort to cure them, within certain limits, and to overcome them. These incessant and persistent efforts ... form the terrain of the "conjectural," and it is upon this terrain that the forces of opposition organize. (178) Santería emerges from an Afro-Cuban subaltern location—racialized and gendered subjectivity due to colonial inscriptions—and the desire to uphold cultural and ethnic hegemony through religious performance by means of collective representation. This type of "conjectural" organic resistance is also found in the works of Lydia Cabrera. In her studies about Afro-Cuban traditions, Cabrera perverts the "order of things" when comparing hegemonic anthropological discourses to fictional accounts of Afro-Cuban cultural and religious life. Cabrera utilizes a scientific premise that allows her to theorize the ethnic and racial Other and expose the fragility of such discourses while blurring the imaginary lines between scientific knowledge and fiction. Another practice of organic resistance is shown in the works of the poet Nancy Morejón. Defying racist representations of Afro-Cubans as well as machismo, Morejón establishes subjectivity through anti-racist and Afro-cubanist representations of blackness; her subject position enables her to speak of cultural images that construct her black woman's body, thus expanding race as well as gender boundaries. Pérez Bravo's organic resistance takes place when she reappropriates Santerías symbolism and its ideological associations to validate and strengthen the social position of the santeras body. At the same time, she transgresses this system by creating a tension between these somatic constructions and those images that are AHR ~ 69</page><page sequence="10">Mariana Bolívar Rubín organic or conjectural—that is, she affirms an imaginary system that is recognizable in the particular social context of Santería. The confluence of those images—santera/Santería—is an unexpected and perverse distortion that opens up the possibility for recreating particular subject positions. What Pérez Bravo is doing is reappropriating Santeria's imaginary and creating a metaphorical perspective for the representation of women. In the photograph entitled "Está en sus manos II," (Fig. 5) Pérez Bravo markedly contrasts the images of the Orula, a wise Lucumi divinity, often regarded as the judge of all Orishas, as well as the deity of Ifá Figure 5. "Está en sus manos II" Fraser Gallery divination. In this photograph, the artist unites her body with the Orisha's as she embodies Orula's form as it is traditionally shown in Santería altars. However, the head of the Orisha is contrasted with the female body of the artist. In the Santería system of knowledge, these two images, Ifá and women, are traditionally opposed. In Peréz Bravo's works, this knowledge is reconstructed within a photographic frame. In her book, Space, Time, and Perversion, Elizabeth Grosz puts together a series of essays around the notion that bodies are not objects of social inscriptions, but rather they are actives sites of representation, and thus of subjective formations. In "Feminism After the Death of the Author," Grosz explores the conception of phallocentic texts in order to put forward a definition of what constitutes a feminist text. A feminist text, argues Grosz, is not necessarily a female production (although a woman can more easily produce an authorial position aware of its limitations and sexual coding) but the reappropriation of the phalocentric ways in which an author carries a position of enunciation in which masculinity is equated to humanity. The feminist text is not only critical of the challenge to patriarchal norms governing it, but it also facilitates the production of new discursive spaces. As Grosz writes: ... it is only through a careful reading of phallocentric texts and paradigms that the rifts, flaws, and cracks within them can be utilized to reveal spaces where these texts exceed themselves, where they say more than they mean, opening themselves up to a feminine (re) appropriation. (38) By looking carefully at the inscriptions of a phallocentric text, a feminist can find a space for enunciation and resistance. In a similar manner, Pérez Bravo's photographic delves into Santeria's imaginary and constructs within it a specific enunciatory position. Resistance arises from a fixation with the female body as a subject that speaks her own space inside Santeria's symbolic system. One can consider Santería as a counter-hegemonic discourse, because it diverges from the 70 ~ AHR</page><page sequence="11">Transgressive Rituals Catholic imagination and finds its own social space of enunciation for Afro-Cuban communities, based on the ethnic and religious inscriptions on the body of social knowledge. However, gender coding is still maintained in order to establish social hierarchical distinctions within Santeria's practitioners. Pérez Bravo fetishizes the female body to subvert social inscription within Santeria's realm. The artist uses her body as a text of social inscription to reinterpret her somatic experience, not only based on ethnicity and religion, but also on gender. In her photographs, Pérez Bravo transgresses the symbolic boundaries between the corporeal and the spiritual when using the discourse of Santería in ways that establish her subjective location as a Cuban practitioner of Santería. Most important, she expands this discursive space in order to address her location as a woman. This transgression is crucial at the level of representation, as it demonstrates how the active power of Afro-Cuban self-enablement and resistance coextend with the constitutive dimensions of language and imagery, and how such performances are inscribed in the material in its most organic modes. Feminist representations of female bodies often confront an oppressive dichotomy between body and mind unscripted in western bodies of knowledge, but the lack of providing an alternative discursive space beyond the sexualized body can become an active subject. María Pérez Bravo's work is grounded in a particular position: the female body and its representation within Santeria's cosmology. Bravo's photographic constructions of the santera's body reappropriate ethnic and gendered representations and transform them into discourses, spaces, and active sites of resistance. Her photography employs the symbolic language of Santeria's rituality— divination and sacrifice—and reconstructs these performances so that the santera's sexual coding can be altered. Borrowing from Elizabeth Grosz's corporal feminism, I have referred to those transformations as events where the body is constantly becoming subject. By means of a creative reapropriation of the Santería imaginary, Pérez Bravo is able to rethink the body beyond docility, and thus the santera's body ceases to function as a site of external regulation and constraint, and becomes an intensified space for female agency and activity.
