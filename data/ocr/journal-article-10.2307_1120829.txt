<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENT CONSTITUTIONALITY OF REQUIRING BELIEF IN SUPREME BEING FOR DRAFT EXEMPTION AS CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR I. THE INSTANT CASE Defendant Daniel Andrew Seeger sought to be exempted from military service as a conscientious objector "by reason of [his] . 'religious' belief"' under Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Service and Training Act.2 Although he declined to state whether he believed in a "Supreme Being," he asserted before his local Selective Service board that "skepticism or disbelief in the existence of God does not necessarily mean lack of faith in anything whatsoever."3 The local board and the two appeal boards4 determined that Seeger's pacifist and agnostic creed5 was not "religious" within the statutory definition-"belief in relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation"6-and classified him as fully accept- able for military service.7 Two years later, Seeger was indicted and convicted 1.

App. ? 456(j) (1958): "Nothing contained in this title . . . shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service . . . who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. Religious training and belief in this connection means an individual's belief in relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code." 3. Instant case at 847-48; see U.S. Selective Service System Form No. 150, Special Form for Conscientious Objector, dated Feb. 9, 1959, Series II, Question I: "Do you believe in a Supreme Being? C] Yes C] No" Seeger submitted the following statement in lieu of indicating either "Yes" or "No": "Of course, the existence of God cannot be proven or disproven, and the essence of his nature cannot be determined. I prefer to admit this and leave the question open rather than answer 'yes' or 'no'. "However, skepticism or disbelief in the existence of God does not necessarily mean lack of faith in anything whatsoever. The martyrdom of Socrates is sufficient proof that irony and skepticism may be consistent with positive faith. Such personages as Plato, Aristotle and Spinoza evolved comprehensive ethical systems of intellectual and moral integrity without belief in God, except in the remotest sense. Others, such as Epicurus, Lucretius, Sartre, and John Dewey, are, I believe, frankly atheists. "Action taken through fear of God or desire for eternal reward is not moral conduct but merely expediency. Plotinus said, 'If a man seeks the good life for anything outside itself, it is not the good life he is seeking.' I feel more respect for this nobler spirit of pagan antiquity, i.e., belief in and devotion to goodness and virtue for their own sakes, and a religious faith in a purely ethical creed. "The cosmic order does, perhaps, suggest a creative intelligence. But considering the natural world outside of man, with its ceaseless struggle for survival and its in- discriminate distribution of cataclysmic natural phenomena, one may doubt that this intelligence is informed with amoral [sic: a moral] purpose. Rather it would appear that in human history the principle of righteousness has emerged very gradually from man's own painful efforts, uncertain and unblessed." Government Exhibits 12-13. 4.

The district court9 rejected his argument that Section 6(j) "inherently and as applied"'10 violated the establishment and free exercise of religion clauses of the first amendment," as well as the due process clause of the fifth amendment12 and the "religious test" clause of article VI.13 On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, held, reversed. The statutory definition of "religious training and belief" limiting the exemption from compulsory military service to those conscientious objectors who rely on a belief in a Supreme Being as the foundation of their objection is an invalid legislative classification that violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment.

THE CONSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND The first amendment ban against laws "prohibiting the free exercise" of religion absolutely protects freedom of religious belief14 and qualifiedly pre- vents government from restricting conduct in pursuit of such belief.15 The establishment clause prohibits laws "which aid all religions as against non- believers" and laws which favor "those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs."''6 32 C.F.R. ? 1622.10 (Class I-A: Available for military service), ? 1622.11 (Class I-A-0: Conscientious objector available for noncombatant military service only), ? 1622.14 (Class I-0: Conscientious objector available for civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest), ? 1622.16 (Class I-W: Con- scientious obj ector performing civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest) (1962). 8.

An important factor in deciding whether the right of free exercise of religion will prevail over government interests is whether state power is used to regulate or prohibit conduct motivated by religious beliefs (but which at the same time is harmful to society), or to compel behavior offensive to religious principles.

One commentator has reconciled the two principles in the precept that government cannot use religion or religious tests "either to confer a benefit or to impose a burden."18 In the opinion of others,19 including one present Justice,20 the cases construing the clauses seem irreconcilable.21 Another member of the present Court, in an attempt to synthesize the cases, intimated that exemptions from military service for ministers and divinity students are saved from violating the establishment clause because they are influenced, if not compelled, by the free exercise clause.22 In West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette23 the Court denied state power to compel school children to salute and pledge allegiance to the flag. Mr. Justice Jackson commented favorably on Congress's respect for "the conscience of the objector in a matter so vital as raising the Army." Mr. Justice Frankfurter's argument in dissent that the free exercise clause did not "create new privileges" nor afford "freedom from conformity to law because of religious dogma"24 was rejected by three concurring Justices, who believed that the demands of religious freedom outweighed the benefits of a uniform and compulsory flag salute.25 In a later case, however, the Court, voting five to four, upheld Illinois's right to refuse admission to the state bar to an applicant whose religious scruples as a conscientious objector prevented him from taking in good faith an oath to support the state constitution.26 Most recently, in Sherbert v. Verner,27 the Court recognized that "the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege," and rejected the power of a state to deny unemployment compensation to those who refuse to accept work on Saturday because it is their Sabbath.

Laws affecting the freedoms of speech and religion would be subject to more confining constitutional standards under the first amendment than under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.28 Having disavowed the vague standards of substantive due process in economic matters,29 and influenced by the presumption of constitutionality,30 the Supreme Court upheld a federal statute restricting the political activities of federal employees, including military personnel.31 Regulation of these activities lay primarily with Congress, and the Court would interfere with the legislative determination only when such regulation passed "beyond the generally existing conception of govern- mental power" derived from "practice, history, and changing educational, social and economic conditions."32 The due process clause received more explicit definition in Bolling v. Sharpe,3 in which the Court imported the standards of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment into the fifth amendment, holding racial segregation in the District of Columbia un- constitutional because not reasonably related to a proper governmental objective.

Whether Congress has been motivated by genuine respect for those beliefs despite pressing military needs or by a realistic appraisal of the difficulties of coercing potential martyrs is uncertain.38 Reflecting this am- biguity of purpose, the criteria that Congress has established for judging the nature and sincerity of the pacifist's conscience have varied.39 During the period of United States participation in World War I the draft act exempted only objectors who were members of a recognized, established religious sect "whose existing creed or principles forbid its members to participate in war in any form."40 In practice, however, rather than restricting exemption to members of the traditional pacifist religions,4' executive orders and administra- tive regulations42 established procedures within the service for excusing from combatant duty all whose conscience, whether or not religiously impelled, forbade participation in the war. When Congress reinstituted the draft in 1940, it exempted all who were pacifist "by reason of religious training and belief" from combatant service, though leaving them subject to noncombatant or equivalent civilian duties.43 Subsequently, Judge Augustus Hand in United States v. Kauten,44 while dis- claiming any intention to define "religious," read the statutory phrase to include "a belief finding expression in a conscience which categorically re- quires the believer to disregard elementary self-interest and to accept martyr- dom in preference to transgressing its tenets." The Ninth Circuit, however, ch. 75, 12 Stat. 731 ("members of religious denominations, who shall by oath or affirmation declare that they are conscientiously opposed to the bearing of arms, and who are prohibited from doing so by the rules and articles of faith and practice of said religious denominations, shall . . . be considered non-combatants . . .

United States50 the Ninth Circuit, confronted with an objector who asserted he did believe in a Supreme Being and thus lacked standing to challenge the definition,51 concluded that it met "all the accepted tests of due process."52 Tested by the establishment clause of the first amend- ment, the court found Congress's definition comported with the accepted understanding of religion in American society.53 The Second Circuit, in United States v. Bendik,54 rejected the challenge of the appellant, who specifically disavowed belief in a Supreme Being, on the ground that the distinction between religious and philosophic objectors was a matter of congressional discretion not subject to constitutional attack.55 Nonetheless it considered the distinction justified for reasons of administrative convenience.56 A later Ninth Circuit decision57 rejected the argument that the constitutional provision bar- 45.

Characteriz- ing the argument as circular, the court also denied the appellant's first amend- ment claim on the basis of its reasoning in George.59 The most recent case in the Second Circuit, United States v. Jakobson,60 involved a pacifist whose asserted belief in a Supreme Being the court characterized as "total affirma- tion of the basic blessedness of the fact of being." The draft boards and the district court had ruled that this creed was not within the statutory defini- tion.61 Looking to recent Supreme Court decisions,62 Judge Friendly inter- preted the statute to avoid the constitutional issue and found that Jakobson's religion fell within the definition construed "as broadly as the words permit."63 The tension between the statutory definition of "religious training and belief" and the constitutional standard of religion in first amendment cases compelled the court to construe the Supreme Being clause not to require belief in an anthropomorphic deity.64 Both the statutory and constitutional issues have now been accepted for review by the Supreme Court in the Jacobson and Seeger cases. IV. THE OPINION OF THE COURT Although Seeger professed neither belief nor disbelief in a Supreme Being,65 the Government stipulated at trial that his beliefs were both sincere and within Judge Hand's definition of "religious training and belief."66 The court of appeals, therefore, considered only Seeger's constitutional objections as framed on appeal, though it fully re-examined the facts and emphasized his sincerity.67 In reviewing the history of the conscientious objector provisions, 58.

The premise of the Department of Justice "that the reference to belief in 'a Supreme Being' in the question . . . necessarily meant the same thing to appellant as the reference to belief in 'a Supreme Being' in section 456(j) [see note 2 sutpra] meant to Congress" was false according to the court. Id. at 5 (slip decision). Thus, while avoiding the first amendment issue posed by the appellant, id. at 2, the Ninth Circuit has apparently accepted an interpretation of the disputed Supreme Being requirement broader than the original understanding of the conscientious obj ector himself.

Randall,71 which enunciated the prin- ciple that, whether or not the Constitution compelled the granting of a privilege, Congress could not confer a privilege on unconstitutional conditions.72 Al- though declining to consider the constitutional necessity of the draft exemp- tion, the court accepted the Government's argument that the spirit of the free exercise clause justifiably influenced Congress to distinguish between religious and nonreligious pacifists but refused to consider the argument dispositive of the case.73 Congress's definition of religion, however, by demarcating beliefs induced by divine command from those derived from individual reflection,74 unconstitutionally excluded "other well-established religious sects" that "do not teach a belief in the existence of a Supreme Being."75 The court compared judicial affirmation of Judge Hand's broad definition of religion with Congress's theistic definition, and found that the statutory provision was an imper- missible classification violative of the due process clause of the fifth amend- ment.76 Congress's desire to provide local draft boards with an objective standard could not excuse government testing of religious convictions for secular purposes.77 The court disclaimed any extension of its decision to legislative classifications based on religion in other contexts; hard and fast rules are inappropriate when the dictates of government and religion conflict.78 V. CRITIQUE The Second Circuit has not held the exemption from compulsory military service of religious pacifists unconstitutional, but it has invalidated Congress's definition of "religious training and belief" that restricts the exemption to Service Act, 62 Stat. 618 (1948), 50 U.S.C. App. ? 460(b) (3) (1958), states that appeal boards' decisions shall be final, the Supreme Court has held classification reviewable on enforcement both as to the "jurisdiction" of the boards' decisions, see Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114 (1946), and as to their determination of the sincerity of registrants, see Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375 (1955). An alternative method of review for defendant Seeger would have been by a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. ? 2241 (c) (3) (1958), after submission to induction. 68. Id. at 850-51. 69.

In effect, the court has resurrected the definition enunciated by Judge Hand in United States v. Kauten,79 which prevailed in the circuit during the latter half of World War II.80 Thus the conflict between the Second and Ninth Circuits that once existed as a matter of statutory interpretation seems to have been revived by this decision on the constitutionality of the Supreme Being clause.81 This variance in the decisions could have been tolerated, had the Supreme Court denied certiorari,82 at least until the ex- pected legislative study and reform of the draft laws.83 The grant of Supreme Court review, however, given the finding that Seeger was sincere and the concession that his beliefs were "religious,"84 forecasts that the Court will affirm the judgment, though perhaps not adopt the opinion, of the court of appeals. Judge Friendly's opinion in United States v. Jakobson,85 construing the Supreme Being clause "as broadly as the words permit," did not come down until after Seeger's trial. Thus on his appeal the court of appeals could have remanded the issue of the statute's application86 to the district court or local board for reconsideration in light of this broadened interpretation. However, to find on rehearing that Seeger was a pacifist by "religious training or belief" the trier would have to conclude that his beliefs were "in relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation" -notwithstanding his original refusal to affirm a belief in a Supreme Being.87 Seeger's response to the question suggests that he equated the statutory term "Supreme Being" with the word "God" as understood in the Judaeo-Christian 79. 133 F.2d at 708. 80. See United States ex rel. Reel v. Badt, 152 F.2d 627 (2d Cir. 1945), cert. dis- missed, 328 U.S. 817 (1946) ; United States ex rel. Phillips v. Downer, 135 F.2d 521 (2d Cir. 1943); United States v. Kauten, 133 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1943). 81. Whether there is a genuine conflict between the circuits is uncertain. The instant case might be distinguished from the Ninth Circuit cases that have upheld the Supreme Being clause on the ground that it involved an objector whom the Government conceded to be "religious." Indeed, the court of appeals distinguished its own previous decision in United States v. Bendik, 220 F.2d 249 (2d Cir. 1955), because the applicant in that case had been a nonreligious objector. The Ninth Circuit's brief opinion in Etcheverry v. United States, 320 F.2d 873, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 930 (1963), does not indicate whether the defendant's objection was based on religious belief. The same court's decision in Clark v. United States, 236 F.2d 13 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 882 (1956), is equivocal on the point. The defendant in Peter v. United States, 324 F.2d 173 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. granted, 32 U.S.L. WEEK 3385 (U.S. May 4, 1964) (No. 787), seems to have been a "religious" objector within the meaning of Kauten, but he apparently did not raise the constitutional issue. Nonetheless, SuP. CT. R. 19(b) (conflict among the circuits is persuasive in determining whether to grant certiorari) would seem to be applicable to the Peter and Jakobson cases, which clearly conflict on the intepretation to be given the words "Supreme Being." Moreover, though Seeger, Etcheverry, George, and Clark may be factually reconcilable, there remains a considerable disparity in the application of ? 6(j) between the two circuits. 82.

In any event, Judge Friendly's language in Jakobson is probably broad enough to support a finding that Seeger's beliefs fall within the statutory definition as construed. The Supreme Court by tradition is disposed to avoid constitutional issues by construing questionable legislation within constitutional limits.89 In the instant case this predilection may move the Court to interpret the Supreme Being clause as including Seeger's creed. To restrict by constitutional limita- tion Congress's exercise of its powers "to raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces," as well as its power to make all "necessary and proper" laws to achieve these purposes,90 may be unwise at a time when the circumstances of future wars are not foreseen.91 Moreover, since in the instant case the principles of free exercise and establishment may conflict with each other, as well as with enumerated congressional powers, the Court may be particularly concerned to avoid a constitutional decision. The court of appeals chose to rest its decision on the vague standards of the due process clause of the fifth amendment, rather than the more explicit prohibitions of the first amendment. Its choice may have been designed to avoid a peculiarly difficult dilemma: to find the Supreme Being clause an "establishment" of theistic religion would imply that the exemption of religious pacifists is in itself an "establishment" of all religions. But the fifth amend- ment, it is submitted, does not confine congressional discretion as narrowly as the court suggests. The court's express reservation with respect to "legis- lative classifications in terms of religion in any other context" indicates that distinctions based on religion are not absolutely forbidden by the Constitu- tion.92 If Congress can constitutionally exempt pacifists from compulsory military service, it can adopt reasonable means to test their eligibility. It has chosen to exempt those whose objection derives from a belief in a Supreme Being, perhaps on the theory that only this standard can reliably test sincerity. While the court of appeals would define the exemption to include all religious objectors as defined in Kauten, the due process clause does not empower the judiciary to re-examine legislative judgments for which there is a reasonable basis. Thus the fifth amendment alone is an inadequate basis for holding the Supreme Being clause unconstitutional.

The court of appeals should have considered the constitutional question to be whether the present exemption of religious pacifists from compulsory mil- itary service avoids being an establishment of religion because designed to permit its free exercise, even though the exemption may not be compelled by the first amendment.94 The laws attacked in Torcaso v. Watkins,95 Engel v. Vitale,96 and School Dist. v. Schemp p97 were not intended to facilitate free exercise of religion but to endorse by governmental means a religious practice when there was no suggestion that failure to do so would violate the first amendment. Whether Congress could constitutionally refuse to accommodate religious pacifists has never been tested, for since the Civil War it has con- sistently exempted most religious objectors.98 Nonetheless, a court might reasonably conclude that the exemption of all religious pacifists would not effect an establishment of religion on the theory that to deny the exemption might be to prohibit its free exercise. The crucial question would then become whether the Supreme Being test is a valid implementation of the guarAntee of free exercise as most recently interpreted by the Supreme Court. The Court's decision in Sherbert v. Verner99 implied that when a state exempts certain persons from the operation of a mandatory requirement in order to accommodate their religious beliefs, it must, if feasible, permit the same freedom of religious exercise to the mem- bers of all religions.100 Only a "compelling state interest'"10l can justify pre- ferring certain religions in granting the exemption. The Supreme Being clause, no matter how broadly construed, does prefer one type of religious belief over another; indeed, even if it is interpreted to embrace Seeger's beliefs as well as Jakobson's, the Supreme Court may hold the requirement of belief in a Supreme Being unconstitutional "on its face."'102 If the clause is the product 93.

Yet deletion of the clause would still require those who are pacifist by reason of their "religious training and belief" to show the nature of their training and establish the sincerity of their belief.'03 Alter- natively, Congress could avoid a religious test altogether, and exempt all conscientious objectors whose sincere opposition to war makes them unsus- ceptible to military training or criminal punishment.104 Whatever test is used, Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. PA. L. REV. 67, 86-88 (1960). The author of the note suggests that the Court will invalidate federal criminal legislation if it concludes that the defendant's conduct is not particularly evil, that the ambiguity of the statutory language urged by the defendant is not an excuse for evasion, and that clearer legislative means of achieving the end sought are possible and practicable. Cf. notes 103-09 infra and accompanying text. Although the Supreme Being clause is not ambiguously worded, the Court has been reluctant to permit capricious administration of statutes that are indefinable in application. In recent years the Court has considerably relaxed the requirements of standing in religion cases. See E. J. Brown, Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?-The School-Prayer Cases, 1963 THE SUPREME COURT REV. 1, 17-24, 31-33. The Supreme Being clause exempts defendants from a criminal statute on the basis of a standard whose application neither defendants nor the administering agencies can easily predict. In Cantwell v. Connecticut,. 310 U.S. 296, 302 (1940), the Court voided a state statute regulating solici- tation because it required the administering official to make the initial determination of "whether such cause is a religious one or is a bona fide object of charity or philanthropy ...." When the application of a statute is initially a matter of administrative determina- tion, the Court will permit a litigant to attack its constitutionality regardless of whether it has been found to apply to him. Irregular application by the administrator and the difficulty of eventual Supreme Court review may be grounds for declaring such a statute unconstitutional. See [Amsterdam] Note, supra, at 96-104. 103. See 32 C.F.R. ?? 1621.11, 1622.1 (1962); Smith &amp; Bell, The Conscientious Objector Program-A Search for Sincerity, 19 U. PITT. L. REV. 695, 708, 709 (1958). For Seeger to prevail on his defense that the Supreme Being clause is unconstitu- tional, the Supreme Court must confine its decision to that clause alone. See 50 VA. L. REV. 178, 179 n.2 (1964). Should it conclude that the second sentence of the statutory pro- vision, see note 2 supra, which defines "religious training and belief" in the first sentence, is inseparable from that phrase, the entire provision would be unconstitutional; Seeger would have no defense under the statute and be guilty, as charged, of refusing to submit to induction. However, after Congress enacted the exemption for conscientious objectors, Universal Military Training and Service Act ? 6(j), 62 Stat. 612 (1948), as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. ? 456(j) (1958), it enacted a separability provision, 1951 Amendments to the Universal Military Training and Service Act ? 5, 65 Stat. 88 (1951), which reads: "If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the Act and of the application of such provision to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby." Under this provision it would seem that the Court could hold the sentence requiring belief in a Supreme Being unconstitutional without thereby invalidating the entire exemption of "religious" conscientious objectors. "Boilerplate" separability provisions need not be conclusive as to congressional intent. But see Charles C. Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 598 (1937). See generally HART &amp; WECHSLER, THE FEDERAL COURTS AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 176-80 (1953). Moreover, the sentence sought to be separated in the instant case constitutes Congress's only definition of the phrase "religious training and belief." This phrase, however, had acquired a meaning, albeit disputed in litigation, when it was first enacted in 1940; the unconstitutionality of the congressional gloss of 1948 may lead the Court to read it not as an explanation of Congress's original purpose, as it in form purports to be, but as an additional requirement for exemption enacted by a later Congress. Under this analysis, the re-enactment of the first sentence in 1948 was merely a formality, and the two sentences are separable. 104. Cf. National Service Act, 1948, 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6, c. 64, ? 17 (providing for exemption of "conscientious objectors" through a system of local and appellate tribunals without any definition of the term).</page><page sequence="13">950 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW the broad discretion given the Director of the Selective Service System105 and the fact that no classification is permanent106 are more realistic checks on the spurious claimant. It is quite possible that the Supreme Being clause works more to disqualify the sincere objector than to identify the insincere. An increase in the small107 number that are now exempted would probably not undermine the country's military strength; under existing law108 exempted pacifists must either serve in a noncombatant military capacity or perform civilian labor contributing to the "national health, safety, or interest."109 Thus, although the Supreme Being clause probably satisfies the vague standards of the fifth amendment, under the reasoning of Sherbert v. Verner110 it may be a violation of the free exercise clause, since there are reasonable alternative means of achieving the legislative purpose. Regardless of the Supreme Court's disposition of the Seeger and Jakobson cases, Congress should reformulate the exemption of conscientious objectors. A great many potential draftees are now exempted under a hodgepodge of statutes and administrative regulations.111 The exemption of all convinced objectors, without respect to religious belief, would not frustrate the purpose of the draft-the inducement of voluntary enlistments'12-and it would exclude those who would be likely to undermine military discipline. Moreover, it would be immune from attack under the first amendment. With the develop- ment of federal youth programs, such as the Peace Corps, it seems anomalous to deny the sincere conscientious objector an option, if qualified, to serve his nation in a nonmilitary capacity. Such a solution would not only utilize man- power efficiently, but would also maintain national pride and morale both within and without the armed forces. 105.
