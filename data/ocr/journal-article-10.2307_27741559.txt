<plain_text><page sequence="1">LORCAS FLOATING IMAGES JULIAN PALLEY University of California, Irvine Robert Goldwater has explored the theme of space and dream that characterized an exhibition of surrealist art in Cologne in 1967; ' one of the identifiable features of that art is the vision of ob jects seemingly drifting in space, in a dream-space that opens the mind to reverie. Joan Mir?'s later period is permeated with objects, at times symbolic, at times random, caught in movement in an un familiar spatial setting. Goldwater affirms that: ?In a sense the ideal expression of space and dream during this whole period is given by the work of Joan Mir?.?2 In Dali's desert landscapes, like The Persistence of Memory, the desert, on which objects are seen suspended, is nearly indistinguishable from the sky that floats above it. The more solid objects of Jean Arp are viewed floating in a chilling emptiness. Paul Klee's enigmatic and innocent heads are suspended in an oneiric space, and fish and other objects drift aimlessly in his Fish Magic. Chagall's persons and animals are always hanging or flying in midair, although they seem to relate to terrestrial beings or structures below. Who can forget Yves Tanguy's eerie, drifting, amorphous creatures, or Magritte's cloud swept skyscapes, that enclose a distant human eye? Even Max Ern st, whose most celebrated canvases portray a ravaged or malevolent earthbound nature, has painted immense heavy birds that are either suspended or rising in the air {Monument to Birds). These objects or images floating, at times on water, at times in the air, can be discerned throughout the trajectory of Garcia Lorca's poetry. Like Mir? himself, who according to the art critic, ?always seemed more of a fellow traveler than an active Surrealist,?} Lorca was disinclined to discuss theories of surrealism or to follow the dictates of a mechanical automatism, with its rules 161</page><page sequence="2">162 ALEC, 6(1981) and procedures espoused by Breton. Like Mir? he was also an en fant prodige whose dream images seemed to flow playfully and painlessly, especially in the early poetry of Canciones. Where Breton and his circle would issue manifestos, debate and argue, Lorca and Mir? drew deeply on their unconscious, gave free rein to their ludic and imaginative faculties, and produced a work which eventually surpassed that of the labeled, card-holding members of the movement. There is a remarkable correspondence between Lor ca's drawings of the twenties, and Mir?'s drawings and paintings of the same period. Compare, for example, Lorca's P?jaro y perro, Ojo y vilanos, or Parque4 with Mir?'s Painting on a White Ground, Automaton or Pastorale5: the same delicate, moving lines, the not quite-identifiable figures, the playful suggestiveness of human or natural forms, and the floating, random quality of the images. Gaston Bachelard's phenomenological criticism has studied the impact of the four traditional elements (air, water, earth, fire) on poetry and fiction. Among the many ?floating images? or ob jects to be found in Lorca's poetry, there is one that Bachelard, recalling a line from Rimbaud, has discussed under the heading of the complexe d'Oph?lie: flottaison bl?me Et ravie, un noy? pensif, parfois descend... (Rimbaud, ?Le Bateau ivre?) The motif of Ophelia, floating, dead, on the water's surface, her clothing and hair spread out in moving circles, gives rise to a dream of water: ?C?st l'eau r?v?e dans sa vie habituelle, c'est l'eau de l'?tang qui d'elle m?me 's'oph?lise,' qui se couvre naturellment d'?tres dormants, d'?tres qui s'abandonnent et qui flottent...Alors dans la mort, il semble que les noy?s flottant continuent a r?ver...?5 This image or motif is deeply rooted in Lorca. It emerges in Primeras canciones, continues through Canciones and the Romancero gitano, and is to be found in Poeta en Nueva York, although, by then subsumed into the general vision of decay and foreboding. From Primeras canciones, the ?Cautiva?, who is la vida, is seen drifting: Por las ramas indecisas iba una doncella</page><page sequence="3">PALLE Y 163 que era la vida. Por las ramas indecisas. Con un espejito reflejaba el dia que era un resplandor de su frente limpia. Sobre las tinieblas andaba perdida, llorando roc?o, del tiempo cautiva.7 Here the girl-life is seen drifting ?above the fog? and ?through the branches?; life is ?captive of time? and is ?lost.? These surrealist images could be from paintings by Mir? or Chagall (see, for exam ple, Chagall's gouache The Dream and its angelic, floating figure.) This early poem anticipates the continued preoccupation with floating female figures in Lorca's entire poetic canon. Thus the first poem of Canciones, ?Las siete doncellas,? compares the col ors of a sunset to ?seven maidens? who die along water: (En el aire blanco siete largos p?gjaros.) El r?o las trae, nadie puede verlas, (p. 287) This poem is announced as a ?theory of the rainbow,? and the siete doncellas, are the basic colors that ?die with the sunset.? Yet they are represented as doncellas, and, like Ophelia, they die in or on the river, Often when the poet applied his imagination to celestial phenomena, the complexe d'Oph?lie emerges in the imagery. The repeated motif of a girl drowned in a pool or lake (that we will observe in Romancero gitano and Poeta en Nueva York) ap pears as a metaphor (for the water itself?) in ?Nocturnos de la ven tana?: Al estanque se le ha muerto hoy una ni?a de agua.</page><page sequence="4">164 ALEC, 6 (1981) Est? fuera del estanque, sobre el suelo amortajada. De la cabeza a sus muslos un pez le cruza, llam?ndola. El viento le dice ?ni?a,? mas no pueden despertarla. El estanque tiene suelta su cabellera de algas y al aire sus grises tetas estremecidas de ranas. Dios te salve. Rezaremos a Nuestra Se?ora de Agua por la ni?a del estanque muerta bajo las manzanas, (pp. 297-98) Like Bachelard's avatars of Ophelia, the pond's girlchild ?seems to continue to dream.? Neither the wind nor the fish can arouse her. She is surely a forerunner of the dead Gypsy girl of the ?Romance son?mbulo,? of whom the poet says ?Las cosas la est?n mirando / y ella no puede mirarlas.? The general transformation of nature and celestial bodies into anthropomorphic figures, that is, Lorca's animism, here seems to equate the water with the dead and floating girl. This is the opposite of the metaphor achieved by Jorge Guillen in his ?El manantial? from C?ntico, in which the river-spring becomes transformed into a smiling and very alive young woman. But is the speaker here referring to a girl or to the water itself? The image appears to function both on the literal and the allegorical levels: the poem retains its ambiguity. In ?Paisaje? (p. 302) ?La tarde est? tendida / a lo largo del r?o.? And in ?Mi ni?a se fue a la mar? (p. 306) there is once again the image of the girl and the river, she who ?se encontr?, de pronto / con el r?o de Sevilla.? The girl does not die, but ?En el aire sonrosado / cinco anillos se mec?an.? Still more Ophelian imagery occurs in ?Tarde? (p. 307): En el r?o, un ?rbol seco,</page><page sequence="5">PALLEY 165 ha florecido en c?rculos conc?ntricos. Y he so?ado sobre las aguas a la morenita de Granada. The tree which ?flowers in concentric circles? is a striking image associated with the Ophelia archetype. The reflected dead tree is brought to seeming life by the swirling ?flowers? of water. The tree becomes immediately associated with a real girl, of whom the poem dreams (as floating?) on the water's surface. ?Come tous les grands complexes po?tisants, le complexe d'Oph?lie peut monter jusqu'qu niveau cosmique. Il symbolise alors une union de la Lune et des flots. Il semble qu'un immense reflet flottant donne une image de tout un monde qui s ?tiole et qui meurt.?* It is puzzling that Bachelard never mentions Lorca, since the Granadine poet seems to provide the best paradigm of all for the complex of images that the French critic describes. The moon and the girl floating on water are united in the extraordinary metaphor of the ?Romance son?mbulo.? But there are a number of antecedents in the earlier poetry of the image of the moon, that symbol of death and absence in Lorca, reaching out and touching the water, not with an icicle, but with other sharp ob jects. In ?Verlaine? (p. 311), for example: y la luna picaba con un rayo en el agua. and in ?Segundo aniversario? (p. 325) La luna clava en el mar un largo cuerno de luz. And in the same poem: El cielo flota sobre el aire como una inmensa flor de loto. This striking simile combines the sensation of ascension (lightness, airiness, upward movement) with the floating images of the sur realist painters. The narcissus flower (in ?Narciso,? p. 339) is seen</page><page sequence="6">166 ALEC, 6 (1981) reflected on the surface of the water, while Por tus blancos ojos cruzan ondas y peces dormidos. Here the speaker relates to both the flower and the mythological figure: all three share a grief and delirio. In the following poem (?Granada y 1850?) his reverie drifts from his window to the foun tain, where Yo sue?o que no sue?o dentro del surtidor, (p. 340) The floating images, and the water, continue in ?Preludio?: Las alamedas se van pero nos dejan el viento. El viento est? amortajado a lo largo bajo el cielo. Pero ha dejado flotando sobre los r?os sus ecos. El mundo de las luci?rnagas ha invadido mis recuerdos. Y un coraz?n diminuto me va brotando en los dedos. (P. 340) This piece is not unlike Jorge Guillen's ?Primavera delgada?, with its images of poplars, wind and the sky reflected in the water. But what sets it apart from Guillen's splendid use of metaphor (the abstracting or personification of natural phenomena), is precisely the ?painterly? surrealist images, the shrouded sky, and the heart that ?sprouts from my fingers.? The flowering hands that appear in Lorca's drawings, as well as in those or Mir?9and Tanguy, are a common surrealist motif. The puzzling and evocative ?Canci?n in?til? (p. 345), with its sense of foreboding, once more brings together fish, water, floating objects and the speaker's dilemma: Hombre y pez en sus medios, bajo cosas flotantes,</page><page sequence="7">PALLEY 167 esperando en el alga o en la silla su noche, ?quiero olvidarlas! The poet seems to lament the contigency of all life, the inevitability of death, man's aloneness with the ?things? that float ?in his medium.? In the end, he, like Quevedo, seems to be fashioning his own death: ??S?lo yo! / Labrando la bandeja / donde no ir? mi cabeza.? The playful (if at times anguished) experimentation of Can ciones is followed by the tragic vision of the Romancero gitano. Lorca's themes of love and death take a dramatic form, but the dream world that pervaded the earlier work continues to infuse nearly all of the romances. The surrealist image and metaphor becomes more startling, more daring. The moon relates to death, and the Gypsy child accompanies it on its walk through the sky: Por el cielo va la luna con un ni?o de la mano, (p. 354) And in ?Reyerta,? Y ?ngeles negros volaban por el aire del poniente, (p. 357) The Lorcan leitmotif of the dead girl floating on water?the complexe d'Op?lie?achieves its most striking realization in the ?Romance son?mbulo.? The poem can be viewed as a dream of its sleepwalking speaker; the events have the tenuous and broken quality of dreamt images, they do not follow the sequence of wak ing time, and there is no resolution. The poem invites us to dream, with its atmosphere of mystery and somnolence: Grandes estrellas de escarcha, vienen con el pez de sombra que abre el camino del alba, (p. 358) In the suggestion of a plot that can be deduced from the poem, the Gypsy smuggler reaches the house of his beloved and finds her</page><page sequence="8">168 ALEC, 6 (1981) floating on the surface of a pool or cistern, presumably dead (although this is only implied): Sobre el rostro del aljibe se mec?a la gitana. Verde carne, pelo verde, con ojos de fr?a plata. Un car?mbano de luna la sostiene sobre el agua, (p. 360) In the metaphor car?mbano de luna the tenor (ray of moonlight) is implied, and we are given only the vehicle, the icicle which recalls the goad and horn of the earlier poems. Thus Lorca integrated his obsessive Ophelia vision into the dramatic frame of the ballad; and here it provides the climactic ending to the dream-poem. The ar chetypal image-symbol of the moon (death, woman, absence) is joined to the figure of the floating girl in a fixed symbiosis. This image's affinity with surrealist painting may be observed by com paring it to Mir?'s Dog barking at the Moon, in which a white ice like ladder reaches up to a menacing moon. The moon's implied reflection ?creates an image of a world that withers and dies.? (Bachelard) In this poem that world which ?withers and dies? may be that of Spanish Gypsy culture itself, which Lorca sought to preserve in his private, yet universal, mythology. Poeta en Nueva York was Lorca's boldest experiment in sur realism, a work of great power within its obscurity. Its images of a decaying world can never be finally explicated, defined or pigeonholed; this is truly an ?open work? (in Eco's sense)70 that is more of an ever-changing process than a fixed object. But certain ly, as Richard Predmore has made clear," for the first time Lorca spoke unequivocally of his agonizing personal problems, his outrage at social injustice, and his complex feelings toward the Catholic Church that had nurtured him. It is ?about? New York on one level, but in a deeper sense it is about himself. Surrealist visions of celestial, transforming objects abound in this work, and for one last time the poet returns to his dream of a dead girl floating on water. ?Ni?a ahogada en el pozo? contains the subtitle (Granada y Newburg), which suggests that, although written in New York state, the poet was thinking of an incident, perhaps from his childhood, which inspired the drowned girl im</page><page sequence="9">PALLE Y 169 ages.72 Minetras la gente busca silencios de almohada t? lates para siempre definida en tu anillo, ...que no desemboca. Eterna en los finales de unas ondas que aceptan combate de ra?ces y soledad prevista. ...que no desemboca. ?Ya vienen por las rampas! Lev?ntate del agua! ?Cada punta de luz te dar? una cadena! ...que no desemboca. Pero el pozo te alarga manecitas de musgo, insospechada ondina de su casta ignorancia. ...que no desemboca. (p. 433) (I have quoted only four of the nine stanzas.) The now familiar im ages return, transfigured, more obscure now in their surrealist set ting. The girl is ?defined in her ring?: are these the concentric circles of the earlier poem (?Tarde,? from Canciones)! The phrase ?los finales de unas ondas? would suggest the same image. The ?manecitas de musgo,? offered by the pozo, recall the wind and the fish in the estanque of ?Nocturnos de la ventana? (from Can ciones). The girl becomes an undine, the water spirit of mythology. Derek Harris believes that the poem is an allegory for inhibited sexual desire; so the ?still water? is worse than death, worse than the ?statues who suffer the darkness of coffins? (stanza 1). ?This is the import of the poem, a symbolic drowning in the still water...?/J We encounter here that ?dark, silent and sleeping water? that Bachelard found in Poe, the water which suggests a meditation on death.14 Stagnant water does indeed reappear later in the tragedies, especially in La casa de Bernarda Alba, as a symbol of repressed desire. Yet, even though it may be transformed into symbol or allegory, the image of the girl floating on water comes back to haunt him in New York; that vision which first arose in Canciones: ?Y he so?ado sobre las aguas, / a la morenita de Granada? (p. 307). The phrases ?eterna en los finales de unas ondas? and ?definida en tu anillo? suggest that the poet cannot escape this</page><page sequence="10">170 ALEC, 6 (1981) memory, and they also portray the widening circles of the Ophelia archetype. Innocence, chastity, serenity in death, nature's indif ference (the ?tiny hands of moss?) are all qualities of the Shakespearian configuration. ?Tranquilla en mi recuerdo,? the poet states in the third stanza: how can we reconcile this phrase with the theme (as interpreted by Harris and others) of repressed sexuality? I would like to suggest that all of these images may have had their origin in a real memory from the poet's childhood in Fuente Vaqueros or Granada; an image that stayed with him in his New York poems. It is possible to view ?Ni?a ahogada en el pozo? (like the earlier ?Nocturnos de la ventana?) on both levels, that of the literal image and the allegorical or symbolic, that is, the manifest and the latent contents. The dead girl of the New York poem could be a pr?figuration of repressed sexual desire, as the memory of Beatrice exists both in fact and as symbol in the Comm edia. Thus the floating dream objects of surrealism, the water and the girl of the complexe d'Oph?lie, although transformed in significance, accompanied Garcia Lorca throughout his too brief existence.
