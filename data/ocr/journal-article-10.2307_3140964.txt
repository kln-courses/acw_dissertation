THE BACKGROUND OF PROPHECY AND PROPHETISM IN THE NORTHERN KINGDOM. ? 56. The Scope of This Period is that of the Northern as distinguished from the Southern Kingdom. It commences with the revolt of the Northern tribes under Jeroboam I. (933 B. C.), an event incited by the prophets; and closes with the fall of Samaria (722 B. C.), an event foretold by the prophets in considerable minuteness. This period includes: i. The more or less successful efforts of Northern Israel to establish herself in spite of wars with Judah (933-887 B. C.), with Syria (890-790 B. C.), and with Assyria (854-722 B. C.). 2. Three successive and prolonged struggles: (i) of Jeroboam I. and his successors with misfortune of every kind, intensified by disorganiza- tion and confusion, until Omri builds Samaria and makes it the central and controlling factor in the Kingdom (933-885 B. C.); (2) of Omri's dynasty and that of Jehu, with the prophets Elijah, Elisha, and their fol- lowers who were unwilling that the worship of Jehovah should be contami- nated by the impurities of Baalism (885-784); (3) of Jeroboam II. and his successors, with Assyria on the one hand, and on the other with the prophets Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah, who recognized in Assyria the instru- ment in Jehovah's hands for Israel's punishment and destruction (784-722 B. C.). 3. Three startling and indeed significant movements of prophetic char- acter, each seemingly revolutionary, but each, when viewed closely, passing onward to the next, the three together constituting the real foundations of prophecy; viz., (i) the prophetic revolt from despotism and priest-control at the time of Solomon's death which alone furnished opportunity for the freedom demanded for prophetic growth; (2) the assumption by the prophets of a power superior to that of kings, in their determined effort to rid them- selves of the injurious influence of outside religious cults; and (3) the transi- tion, made necessary by the situation, from the primitive methods and ideas of the earliest prophets, to the more permanent and efficient work of the writing prophets, of whom Amos was, perhaps, the first. 128</page><page sequence="2">PROPHETIC ELEMENT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 129 4. Three contests of great importance in world-history; (i) the battle of Karkar, 854 B. C., in which Israel's military forces (in union with armies of other nations) first met defeat at the hands of Assyria; (2) the Syro- Ephraimitish campaign (735 B. C.) against Judah, the end of which was the fall of Damascus (732 B. C.); (3) the siege of Samaria and its final destruc- tion in 722 B. C. ? 57. The Character of the Period has been partly indicated in the statement of its scope (? 56). If we attempt to think of it as a whole, two centuries and more, we are able, in spite of the great variety which it pre- sents, to distinguish certain predominant features: i. There is almost always to be noted a condition of disorganization and confusion which very frequently becomes anarchy. At no time does the government seem to have been regarded as stable. This was due in part, at least, to the prevalence of a democratic spirit, a spirit without which prophecy could not have been developed. While this is the home situation, the foreign relations are even worse, resulting in continuous wars with one or another of the outside powers (see ? 56). 2. It is evidently a period during the progress of which a great transition is taking place, e. g., from agricultural life and residence in villages, to mili- tary life and residence in cities-a change due to the warlike character of the times. Little of the pastoral life remains. Mercantile ideas and influ- ences prevail. This has come about in large measure because of the wars. And with this change have come great wealth, and, particularly in the reigns of Jeroboam II. in Israel and of Uzziah in Judah, great prosperity. These are Israel's days of greatest splendor, and are due, in large measure, to the peace which followed the Syrian wars. 3. In these years Israel is in the fullest sense an independent world- power-one of the lesser kind, in contest with "the restless aggressiveness of the gigantic empire of Assyria." This was in accordance with the divine plan, which involved a close contact of Israel and Judah, for educational purposes, with all the great world-powers of antiquity. Israel never was an isolated nation, and never was intended to be, until long after the Baby- lonian exile. As a part of this general movement there came to Israel a closer intercourse with foreign nations. This brought about a widening of her intellectual horizon, a stronger and deeper sense on the part of the true leaders, of her own individuality, and of her mission to the world. For in proportion as she lost her place as a nation, in that proportion was her great vocation realized. With all the bad that came from intimacy with these outside nations, there came much that was good. This good, while not sufficient to save Northern Israel from destruction, was handed down in various ways to the great advantage of posterity.</page><page sequence="3">THE BIBLICAL WORLD 4. The religious zeal of the times was marked; but while outwardly flourishing, it was corrupt on the inside. Tainted with impurity, abounding in pagan customs, given over to magic, necromancy, and superstitious rites of every kind, the more rigidly it was observed, the less of true religion really existed. The immorality of the period was most flagrant; shameless sensu- ality prevailed everywhere. Violence and robbery, murder and corruption were rampant. 5. It is, however, the period of all periods in Israelitish history, in which the prophet has largest place. It is true that he is always in opposition to the governing power; but his opposition is so strong that it means actual control. He was Israel's adviser, and had his guidance been freely accepted the pages of history would have told a far different story. At the same time, these changes in governmen and these many wars with hostile neighbors, this transition in method of life, and the opportunities afforded by increased wealth, this position as a world-power in contact with other world-powers; even this false religious zeal, and the immoral activity of the times-all this furnishes an experience, an object lesson, a text for prophetic appeal and for the announcement of divine law. which was to educate some of those who lived then, and more of those who were to follow. ? 58. The Contemporaneous Literary Work of this period is very large in quantity, and of the highest value. This, in fact, is the age in which Israel comes to literary consciousness. Our greatest difficulty lies in the abundance and the richness of this material. The following may be regarded as a rough catalogue of the most important prophetic material. Distinction is to be made between the literature produced in Northern Israel, and that coming from Judah. For the sake of convenience we may arrange this material in three groups: A. Narrative literature, produced in this period, which relates to times preceding 933 B. C. These works are of especial interest in that their spirit and purpose belong to the times under consideration. They were written to meet the problems of these times; and, presenting as they do the sympa- thies and antipathies of the period, they form a true expression of its inner thought. Here may be placed: i. The great prophetic narrative of Judah, J.' This narrative begins with an account of creation and the fall of man, passes rapidly over the I Gen. 2:4b-4:25; 7:I-5, 7-I0, I2, I7b, 22 f; 8:2b, 3a, 6-12, I3b, 20f.; i8:-- 20:38; 24:I-67; 29:1-14, 3I-35; 30:3b-I6, 22b-3Ia, 34-38a, 39, 40a, 40c-43; 3I:I, I7, I8a, 25, 27, 3, 43 f., 46, 48-50; 38 I-30; 39: I-23; 43 1-45 Ia; 48: I3-I9; 49: b- 27; Exod.

Some of the patriarchal episodes most fully described are the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, the selection of a wife for Isaac, Jacob's sojourn with Laban, Judah's treatment of Tamar, the case of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, the visits of Joseph's brethren to Egypt in search of corn, and Jacob's blessing. The residence and bondage in Egypt are related together with the deliverance and exodus. The narrative then follows the history on to Sinai and incorporates at this point the smaller Book of the Covenant. In the further recital of the history especial consideration is given to the Baalam incident, the fall of Jericho, the capture of Ai, and Joshua's relief of Gideon. This document is chacterized by: (a) a charming narrative style, (b) its naive, anthropomorphic conception of God, (c) the use of the name Jehovah, (d) the intensely ethical and theological spirit of the narrative, (e) the pres- ence within it of duplicate accounts of the same event, (/) its lack of chrono- logical indications, and (g) a deep interest in the early history of the human race. The general consensus of scholarly opinion is that while J contains much material coming from very early stages of Israel's life, it assumed its literary form some time early in the eighth century, or late in the ninth century B. C. The narrative thus reflects the ideas of the Judean prophets of the age just prior to Amos. For convenience J and E are treated in this study as single documents; it must be remembered, however, that a truer conception is that they include within themselves various strata of growth and are not the product of two particular individuals, but rather of two schools of prophetic writers.2 2. The great prophetic narrative of Ephraim, E. The first traces of this narrative3 appear in Gen., chap. 15, in connection with the promise to Abraham of a great posterity. The most important sections of it include 2 On the limits, contents, characteristics, date, and origin of J see especially: CARPENTER AND HARFORD-BATTERSBY, The Hexateuch, Vol. I, pp. 97-109; DRIVER, Introduction, etc., pp. II6-25; KUENEN, The Hexateuch, pp. I38-63, 226-61; DILL- MANN, Die Biicher Numeri, Deuteronomium, und Josua, pp. 622-33; HOLZINGER, Einleitung in den Hexateuch, pp. 72-173. 3Gen.

There is in addition much material of a more fragmentary character carrying the history on through the conquest of Canaan. The narrative is, in general, characterized by (a) its evident interest in archaeological and antiquarian subjects; (b) its representation of Jehovah as revealing his will through dreams, visions, and angels; (c) its marked interes in Northern Israel's history rather than that of the Southern King- dom; (d) a distinctly didactic or prophetic tone and purpose; (e) the use of the word Elohim, instead of Jehovah, as the divine name; (/) a somewhat careful and exact chronological arrangement of material. It is generally conceded that E is of northern origin and that it assumed literary form at a time subsequent to J, perhaps in the first half of the eighth century B. C. It is thus a contemporaneous record of prophetic ideals in Northern Israel in the generation before Amos.4 3. The J and E of Judges.5-These sources of the Book of Judges originated during the first or second century of this period. Whether or not they formed a part of the J and E of the Hexateuch cannot be defi- nitely determined, but in any case they come from the same school of pro- 40n the contents, scope, character, date, and origin of the E narrative see especially: CARPENTER AND HARFORD-BATTERSBY, The Hexateuch, Vol. I, pp. IO-20; DRIVER, Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament, pp. 116-26; DRIVER, The Book of Genesis, pp. xi-xxi; HOLZINGER, Einleitung in den Hexateuch, Vol. I, pp. 173-228; KUENEN, The Hexateuch, pp. 138-73, 226-61; DILLMANN, Die Buicher Numeri, Deuteronomium, und Josua, pp. 615-22. sThe following passages are assigned to J by G.

The earlier Samuel Narrative (see ? 45, i), dealing with the history of the times of Saul and David, and having value for this period because the writer's purpose and point of view appear so plainly in his selection and use of materials and in the general attitude assumed toward these great leaders of former times. 5. The later Samuel Narrative (see ? 45, 2), covering the same period as the earlier narrative, but reflecting a more highly developed stage of thought and feeling and characterized by a distinctly prophetic spirit. 6. The various narratives and documents in Kings relating to David and Solomon, I Kings, chaps. i-II. Chaps. I and 2, dealing with the last acts of David, really belong to the books of Samuel and express the same ideas as the sources of Samuel. Chaps. 3-II include several sources (? 45, 5), among the earliest of which are: (a) an early life of Solomon, the purpose of which seems to have been to emphasize the great wisdom and power of Solomon, and (b) still older annalistic records of Solomon's building operations, and various other matters. These are of interest and value as showing the thought of the times concerning the life and work of Solomon. The pieces, thus included, represent in truest fashion not only (i) the general purpose and spirit of 933-722 B. C., or some special sub- period in these two centuries; but also (2) a definite and separate develop- ment of prophetic growth and prophetic literary expression, standing between the earlier work of Elijah and Elisha, and the later work of Amos and Hosea. ? 59.

This is a series of laws arranged in groups of five and representing the ideas and usages that had come into existence and received general acceptance between the days of Moses and some time in the eighth or ninth centuries B. C. at the latest. This code is characterized by (a) the comparatively primitive character of many of its requirements; (b) the agricultural background reflected in its laws; (c) the predominance of ethical and secular elements in the legislation, almost to the exclusion of ritualistic details; (d) its har- mony with the teachings of the earlier prophets.

Northern or Ephraimite stories concerning Elijah I Kings, chaps. x7-x9 and 2x, and his work, setting the prophet forth as the representa- tive of Jehovah in successful opposition to the policy of a wicked king and the sensuous tendencies of a corrupt people. The narratives are characterized by freshness and vigor and directness of aim. The stories are marked by unity of style and purpose, and have very few later accretions. They come from a comparatively early time as appears, e. g., (a) from the fact that they do not oppose the calf-worship of Jeroboam II. as did Hosea; (b) they know nothing of the Deuteronomic prohibition of local sanctuaries; (c) the statement in i Kings I9:3 that "Beer- sheba belongeth to Judah." On the other hand the stories are not contemporaneous with the events they describe and do not purport to be the records of eyewitnesses. They may wi h reasonable certainty be assigned to the period about 800 B. C. 3. Northern or Ephraimite stories of the Northern King- x Kings, chaps. 20, 22; 2 Kings, dom, characterized by a more favorable estimate of Ahab 9: x-o:27. than that prevalent in the stories concerning Elijah, and concerned with the revolution under Jehu, not as though coming from an active participant and sympathizer with the efforts of the reforming party, but rather from an out- sider without any special prophetic tendencies. Apart from a few later accretions these stories may be assigned to the same general period as the foregoing. 4. Northern stories of Elisha and his work.-In these 2 Kings 2: i-8: stories Elisha is the center of interest. They are of varied I5; I3: 4-21. character and value, and lacking in unity of thought. They seem to have been gathered from various sources, and incor- porated without being brought into perfect harmony with each other. Some of them are evidently historical sources of high value, while others are highly idealistic and poetic pictures of Elisha as interpreted by later times. Altogether they present the various aspects of Elisha's many-sided activity. The stories probably come from different times</page><page sequence="9">THE BIBLICAL WORLD and places, but all may be supposed to have originated in Northern Israel some time about the middle of the eighth century B. C. 5. Southern stories concerning Judah.-These Judean narratives are based upon older sources of information, but were edited by a later hand. The different interests and conceptions of the older writers not infrequently appear in the narratives as they now stand.
