<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mother-Word and French- Language Moroccan Writing Zohra Mezgueldi A great deal has already been written about the malaise that characterizes the language and identity problematics of Maghrebian writers. For my part, I believe that these writers translate the malaise of their very own societies which are overwhelmed by an economic, social, and cultural crisis. For Maghrebian society as a whole, deeply marked by colonialism (whose lingering aftermath is still felt), it is a question of rediscovering a culture eclipsed by the colonizer. At the same time, the diverse cultural aggressions assailing these soci- eties must also be confronted. Finally, Maghrebian societies are obliged to deal with the demands of modernity, reconciling them with an authentic Maghrebian identity. Within the framework of a study on French-language Maghrebian literature, it is best to escape the vicious circle of "alienation" and "acculturation" in which this literature has been hastily enclosed. From this desire and necessity originates the critical perspective on this literary production that defines this study: it is one that consists of renewing the umbilical tie between Maghrebian writers and the cultures of their birth (especially popular culture) and then analyzing the strength of this reestablished relationship. As Mohamed Boughali notes: "Le Marocain dit lettre laisse transparaitre, a travers son discours quotidien et son comportement, le tatouage culturel qu'a plaque sur lui tout entier, le conditionnement social de type traditionnel dans lequel il a tres tot baigne" (248) 'The educated Moroccan reveals through his everyday speech and behavior, the cultural tattoo, plastered onto his entire being by the traditional, social conditioning in which he was submerged early in his life.' This reflection may be applied to the body of Maghrebian intel- lectuals and to French-language writers in particular. The present study is situated in an approach to French-language Moroccan literature which examines the relationship that this production maintains with Moroccan culture of an oral tradition. The question that underpins this analysis is: What does a text by a Moroccan writer of French expression reveal of the mater- nal culture? Through the role that they play in the transmission of culture, women, particularly the mother, occupy a privileged place in the formation of the imagi- nary; for the most part, she assures and forges this element through storytelling. This imaginary, present even in writing, remains marked by the maternal. From birth, the mother introduces the child to language through her maternal verb and she initiates him or her to language through her own body language. The following questions will guide the development of this study: What does the passage from orality to writing represent for the Moroccan writer? Is it a phase? What symbolism does it convey? The mother's writing and the transcrip- tion of orality in the text, are they not a desire to render the "maternal" language</page><page sequence="2">2 Research in African Literatures and culture more valuable? How does the Moroccan writer live with the French language and with the dichotomy between the French language and mother tongue/mother culture? At issue will be the delineation of the entire maternal rela- tionship: the body, the word, and the writing that, according to Abdelkebir Khatibi, underlies the entire structure: ... la langue dite matemelle [qui] est inaugurale corporellement, initie au dire du non-dit de la confusion avec le corps de la mere, et de ce fait, initie a ce qui ne pourra s'effacer dans aucune autre langue apprise, meme si ce parler inaugural tombe en mine et en lambeaux.... Le par- ler maternel parce que justement non ecrit et non eleve au concept de texte, maintient la memoire d'un recit, et sa primaute genealogique, meme renversee et deportee vers une langue absolument diff6rente (...). (Maghreb 191-92) The mother tongue which is bodily inaugural initiates one into the expression of the unspoken from the confusion with the mother's body. In this way, it initiates one to that which cannot be erased in any other learned language, even if this inaugural speech falls into ruins and shreds.... Maternal speech, precisely because it is not written and not elevated to the concept of a text, maintains the memory of a narrative in its genealogical primacy-even if overthrown and deported to an absolutely different language .... The present investigation seeks to uncover, in the works analyzed, reminiscences of the tales of childhood through which the woman forges the imaginary in ques- tion. The mother transmits her tales in a language that she profoundly marks by her femininity. It is a "maternal" language of orality, which is, according to Khatibi's terminology, "bodily inaugural." The analysis of these texts will seek to discern its emergence in writing. Analyzing the role of language not only in its communicative function, but also in its relationship to identity, will also be a focus of this study. Indeed, certain preconceived ideas designate, or classify Maghrebian culture and identity, under the rather vague heading of "Arabo-Muslim," positing it as a univocal entity opposed to a Western culture that is equally homogenized. However, the scope of the Maghreb is presented from this point of view under dif- ferent guises in which language, identity, and culture are engendered and, by their correlation, demonstrate a multiplicity of shattered identities (Grandguillaume 3-28). The bilingualism functioning in French-language literature is still secretly and overtly affected by the mother tongue, present in the very structure of the text, at the heart of which is an orality has been inscribed. It is also accompanied by a phenomenon of feminization of language. As an inaugural body, then, the mother-word (parole-mere) lays out an entire cultural realm, a symbolic field, and thereby inscribes the problematic of identity within that of language. Indeed, the mother-word and the universe to which it corresponds hark back to popular, oral culture whose preservation in Moroccan society is most often assured by the mother, given the fact that society is divided into a masculine world and a feminine world in which the child participates.</page><page sequence="3">Zohra Mezgueldi 3 In order to discern the inscription of the mother-word, three founding and representative French-language texts of Moroccan literature will be analyzed: Driss Chraibi's Le passe simple (1954), Abdelkebir Khatibi's La memoire tatouee (1971), and Tahar Ben Jelloun's Harrouda (1973). For their authors, these texts all mark an entry into novelistic production, and are their first recognized novels. Each of these works may be considered as a kind of "novel of origins," to borrow a phrase from Marthe Robert. These texts also highlight an itinerary, a trajectory where self-writing-i.e., being both the object and subject of the narrative- whether in a fictional or symbolic mode, arises both from necessity and from the most pressing urgency. In Le passe simple, an entire system of associations, of solidarity, and of affinities points to a relationship involving the mother, the imaginary, and writing, as well as delineating a common space evoking orality. The book depicts the oppressive universe of the patriarchal family in which the father, called "le Seigneur," possesses an omnipotent word that reduces the mother and children to silence and obedience. From the start, the narrative is inscribed as a rupture of that silence. The essential intention of Le passe simple is to focus on the problematic of the word. This, in turn, explains the fundamentally verbal character of the son's revolt against the father, brought about by a deprivation of language, experienced by the narrator as an aggression. The narrative's opening presents an inscription that posits silence and the absence of the word as basic elements in a trajectory of violence. In the beginning, there is imposed silence and this clarifies the meaning of the text's starting point. "Le silence est une opinion" (11) becomes, in light of the first part of the book, the narrative of a suppressed violence. The authority of the Spoken, the power and privilege of the "Seigneur," is underscored: [...] si peu statue, qu'il est dogme et si peu dogme que, sitot devant lui, toute autre vie que la sienne, meme le brouhaha de la rue vagi par la fenetre ouverte, tout est annihile. (15) ... so like a statue that he is dogma, so like dogma that, as soon as it comes before him, any life other than his own, even the hubbub down in the street, wailed through the open window, everything is annihilated. The revolt that drives Le passe simple targets this type of word through the emer- gence of a different word. Beyond this first impression of the text, my analysis situates Le passe simple as a writing that proceeds to a painful investigation of an interior space a word from within is thereby inscribed. A monotonous and plaintive singing rising up from the street marks the nar- ration and translates an entire mournful word. The beggar's chant recurs in the story to recall and to denounce the body's suffering, to sing untiringly of the wound. In the text, the chant performs an important function: it imprints the traces of its rhythm by its repetition at significant instances in the narrative. As a plural word and an expression of distress preceding revolt, the chant appears to be an extemalization of a murmured word. It is linked to the mother's lament and is symbolic of the narrator's very own word that is perceived as being profoundly painful in its return to the wound and the oppression of the body. The chant is also</page><page sequence="4">4 Research in African Literatures a recurring allusion to a bond of identification in misfortune and despair among the three characters-the mother, the son, and the beggar. The mother's silent and smothered word is integrated into this threnody as a word linked to the body, evoking in an incessant litany her wound and her oppres- sion-"Ce sanglot muet dans la cuisine" 'This mute sob in the kitchen,' a phrase by which the narrator epitomizes his mother and evokes the threnody that is per- ceived of as an amplification of the mother's barely audible lament. The bond of identity between the mother, the beggars, and the narrator formulated by the nar- ration through a writing of lament consists of an extensive signification in the realm of the word. In fact, the text portrays a dichotomy between two types of words: one of power-symbolized by the Seigneur, and another of counter- power-conveyed by the narrator. It is through the latter that the relationship of identity is established, indicated even more so by the fact that the actors linked above are determined by the same oppressor: the Seigneur, a crystallization of the dominating and repressive word. In light of these factors, the question of identity takes place in an expansive introspective interrogation formulated through writ- ing. Introspection means here a process consisting of directing the gaze toward an individual story rather than an analysis of the social function in which it is inscribed. Might it not be suggested that the writing of the book constitutes a rupture with an identity that the narrator and mother (among others) contest-at different levels-as not being their own? This annihilation of identity that is an element of any domination system- here being patriarchal and colonial-inscribes the problem of identity and its wound in the oppression of the body and deprivation of the word. The narrator refers several times to an imposed silence and, in this sense, he is seen as demand- ing a right to speech (la parole), as well as the right to establish a primary identi- ty that resides in the founding verbal act. My goal here is to emphasize a writing that transmits a parole emanating from a popular, Moroccan, oral culture, whose eruption in the text serves as a dynamic and subversive element. The mother is by far the most submissive and passive character, subordinate and dependent on the Seigneur: "Qu'etait-elle, sinon une femme dont le Seigneur pouvait cadenasser les cuisses et sur laquelle il avait droit de vie et de mort?" (40) 'What was she if not a woman whose thighs the Lord could lock up and on whom he had the power of life or death?' Two aspects of this character enable her to be seen in a more nuanced manner. Plunged into her solitude as an oppressed woman, the mother has only one recourse. Earlier in her life, she had left everything to divine authority through religious invocation. But she does not at all limit herself to the single god of Islam, addressed through the intercession of Muslim saints by whom she feels abandoned and excluded: "J'ai invoque nos saints, ils ne m'ont pas exaucee, ils sont devoues a mon seigneur et maitre" (24) 'I have invoked our saints and they have not answered my prayers, they are dedicated to my lord and master.' Instead, she appeals to "the saints of the Greeks and Russians." The dogma in the name of which Haj Fatmi Ferdi, the Seigneur, has tortured his wife, "si bien torturee, grave, ponctuel, digne, que, cette torture en moins, elle tomberait en poussiere ..." (101-02) 'so well tortured, serious, punctual, worthy, that, with- out this torture, she would turn into dust.' Nonetheless, her unorthodox action is illicit and constitutes as such a sign of insubordination to dogma insofar as it implies a belief in non-Muslim saints. As a possible act of despair, the mother's</page><page sequence="5">Zohra Mezgueldi 5 suicide is paradoxically the manifestation of her own revolt and her own recogni- tion of her individuality. By killing herself, the mother has symbolically under- taken her only free, self-defining, and insubordinate act in the face of dogma and Koranic precepts. The Seigneur who "for years had defined her" accuses his son: Le poison, tu l'as injecte jusque dans l'extreme resignation de ta mere. L'idee d'une revolte ne lui fit jamais venue a l'esprit. Tu l'en as bourree. Elle en est morte. Dieu est en train de lui demander ses comptes: 5000 ans de gehenne, elle s'est suicidee. (249-50) Poison, you injected her with it even into her deep resignation. The idea of revolt never entered her head. You stuffed her full of it. She died from it. God is now asking her for an explanation: 5,000 years in Gehenna, she killed herself. The beggar is a "verbe diarrheique" (12). His word is liberating for the body's suffering. Most of the time, it is an incantation and it echoes the mother's words, by the fact that through the saints, each one maintains a relationship with religion that follows the slightly subversive paths of heterodoxy. The woman and the beg- gar are linked by the lament of the oppressed and excluded body, by their rela- tionship to sainthood-a popular notion in the Maghrebian context-and by their relationship to the irrational, similar in the Maghrebian, collective unconscious. In the subconscious, the beggar is just as ambiguous a figure as the woman. Moreover, this link between the figures occupies a symbolic place in the narrative in regard to the word. As a loquacious character, the beggar is essentially a voice-the mother is also a suppliant and plaintive voice-sometimes a chant, sometimes a clamor designate and define him as such. The writing of the novel revives the tradition of subversive characters, who are often mouthpieces for a rebellious word. Le passe simple takes over verbal phenomenon as an exercise in satirical vigor founded upon a provocative laughter associated with Djoha, a famous, popular character. In the same fashion, the narrator refers to the parabolic word or the public storytellers as his own: "En depit de mon instruction occiden- tale, je continuais de vivre, d'agir, et de juger par paraboles a la maniere de ces conteurs publics" (83) 'In spite of my Western education, I continued to live, to act, and to judge according to parables in the manner of public storytellers.' If the first words of the story carry an Islamic recommendation tied to break- ing the fast, they also situate in a symbolic fashion, a time in popular culture that is conducive to storytelling. Night lends itself to narrative activity. The allusion to this symbolic period of time in the work's opening sentence corresponds to an invitation to listen, an enticement to reading. The reader observes a simultaneous opening to both a narrative space and the space of writing. The first lines also reveal a meaning that is relevant to the position of one who commits the act of utterance. As a state of total abstinence, of an asceticism of the body, fasting can be symbolic of a deprivation of the word and the oppression of the body that the book challenges. The story thus begins with breaking the fast, associated with a rupture of silence; both silence and the fast are imposed by the patriarchal author- ity. As the narrator states later in the text: "J'avais soif de mots, faim d'incanta- toires" (194) 'I thirsted for words, I hungered for incantations.' He thereby posits his word in a relationship to the body and the space of orality.</page><page sequence="6">6 Research in African Literatures The symbolic weight of the text's beginning provokes at once the explosion of meaning by instituting the polysemy which, in this sense, breaks the univocality of the dogmatic word. This play on meaning and language inscribes writing in its functioning relative to that of popular discourse and to the forms of oral culture. The direct or oblique inscription of parasemiological expressions, or stories taken from this discourse, solidifies the scriptural tie with the oral tradition. This link functions, in part, as an identification with the popular word and as a dif- ference opposed to the word of power and domination whether it is from the Orient or the West. The refusal of closure of meaning that characterizes the book's writing puts into operation a kind of open word that functions, for the most part, by reference to a metaphorical and parabolic language that recalls the very processes of popular expression. Therefore, there exists a dynamic of the plural word that is contrasted to the univocal meaning of the sacred word that would contain its own meaning within. The orality of popular culture evokes a dual openness because it liberates meaning and the imaginary. In the oral tradition, meanings are often interdependent and linked to other allusions. It would then be the proverb or anecdote or even the moral tale that would illustrate and support a language that presupposes a true relationship of communication and complicity. In this context, the narrative act proves to be a force of resistance and liberation because it institutes a virtual narrative power. As the text illustrates, this narrative capacity is inherent in the mother. Thus, the narrator declares to her: "Je n'ai cesse de preter une oreille fidele au moindre de tes adages, a la moindre de tes chimeres" (142) 'I have never stopped lending a faithful ear to the least of your sayings, to the least of your dreams.' The strength of narration also resides in the beggar-storyteller and the narrator himself; it is a response to oppression in its most violent form: the deprivation of the word. Narration may be interpreted as being subversive in that it liberates a free and poetic word, one that is resistant to the dictated word and to an imposed silence. Finally, the narrating power that gen- erates the story inscribes revolt in the act of speech and is subversive in that it marks the seizure of language that was forbidden up until then. After he acquires this power, the narrator formulates a desire to struggle, to live, and to define him- self through the mediation of the founding word. Writing, a medium for the word, is the locus of revolt. The entire aim of Le passe simple seeks to link possession of the word with the possession of power. The narrator's deepest hope is to be heard: "Et bon Dieu la-bas il doit bien y avoir des individus a qui j'en dirai deux mots-et ils m'ecouteront" (260) 'And the good Lord up there must have some individuals to whom I'd like to say a couple of words-and they will listen to me.' If the entire scriptural activity of Le passe simple consists in portraying-i.e., unveiling and even demystifying- the space shared by the mother, the narrator-son, and all of those who are excluded from speech, then it would also seem that the text seeks to translate the symbolic and imaginary dimensions of this same space. Therefore, the power of writing has been able to put into effect a double transformation of the lament into an accusa- tion on the one hand, and into subversion on the other. As it explodes the power of the word, writing is implemented to underscore the hitherto mute signs and a repressed word/identity. The objective of La memoire tatouee also supports the arguments raised in this essay in that the poetic processes of meditation and interrogation that function</page><page sequence="7">Zohra Mezgueldi 7 in the narrative strengthen the movement toward the mother who is actually the underlying focus of the entire work. The book is dedicated to the mother and her world and they in turn are central to a web of associations woven by the text's nar- ration, and through which the text derives its sustenance. The issue at hand is to discern the articulation of writing and identity and to determine its relationship to the word's focus upon the maternal figure and the symbolism that characterize the work. This scriptural space, a vast, troubled, and complex autobiographical ter- rain, reveals a dynamic writing that mixes genres/genders and appears to find its raison d'etre in a subtle disorder. The meaning of this textual disorder can be linked to the network of significations tied to memory: Au fond de ce decor, le seul reve de mon enfance dont je n'oublie pas la precision me montre enroule par une grosse vague, puis projete sur la plage. Pas de sentiment de terreur, plut6t une attente, un vide, comme lorsque, apres un choc brusque, vous attendez la reprise de votre souffle. Mer, mere, memoire, lapsus echappes a cette frileuse nostalgie. (30) At the heart of this decor, the only childhood dream whose precision I do not forget, shows me rolled up by a large wave, then thrown up onto the beach. No sense of terror, rather a waiting, a void, as if after a sudden shock you wait for your breathing to start again. Sea, mother, memory, lapses escaped from this shivering nostalgia. It is in the hollow of this nostalgia, i.e., the association between sea, mother, and the narrator's body (30), that La memoire tatouee inscribes, and whose objectives are crystallized around the figure of the mother. Her presence in the anamnestic writing is significant in regard to the problematic of the word: "Me revient un las- pus: mere a la place de memoire, double absence dans un double hasard" (26) 'A lapse comes back to me: mother in place of memory, double absence in a double chance.' If memory is linked to the mother to the extent that one is interchangeable with the other in the narrator/scriptor's mind, it is not insignificant to note that memory, as an imaginary word, is "disorderly" (55), that is, perverse in the same way as the unconscious that it calls to mind. Thus, the maternal figure establishes the link between "the disorderly memory:" A c6te du Coran, il y avait le talisman et la magie des femmes, par le henne aussi et le tatouage. C'est pourquoi, signe des signes, le sexe est la fin de la memoire desordonnee. (67) Besides the Koran, there was the talisman and women's magic, through henna and tattoos. This is why, sign of signs, sex is the end of the disor- derly memory. and the subconscious, which "is maternal" and feminine in that it "embroiders at leisure upon the fantastic in order to refuse men's religion" (55). It works to sub- vert the order of the system dictated by the patriarchy: "Quand elles te disent: l'inconscient est materel, reponds: je suis patriarche et ordonne le systeme" (55) 'When the women tell you: the subconscious is maternal, answer: I am the patriarch and I command the system.'</page><page sequence="8">8 Research in African Literatures Not only is the dichotomy of separation into two universes (one feminine and maternal, the other, patriarchal) apparent, but there also exists an opposition between two types of words: a word that is feminine (from the realm of the imag- inary, insubordinate and invincible), and a verb of power (patriarchal and uttered as dogma). It is noteworthy that the textual disorder claims to be of the same order as "disordered" memory and of the maternal subconscious. If writing in La memoire tatouee formulates in this way an intense desire of/toward the mother, it also attempts to recapture a kind of "identifying" memory that appears as a mater- nal memory. This fact is important given the author's prior reference to the slip (lapse) that substitutes mother for memory. The text continuously presents gaps, rupture, and division. The textual disorder stems from this dreaded emptiness. Once again, writing inscribes itself in the problematic of desire and loss. It is in this perspective that another meaning is depicted as textual disorder. The relationship to writing is of the order of desire; it should be noted that for Khatibi, scriptural desire has an odor of incest about it: "Comme inceste miroi- tant, cette peur devant l'ecriture, peur d'etre devore par elle, le plus loin possible et de mourir en conspirateur a la fin d'un interminable monologue" (65) 'Gleaming like incest, this fear in the face of writing, fear of being swallowed up by it, the farthest possible and to die as a conspirator at the end of an interminable monologue.' A careful reading of La memoire tatouee demonstrates that doubling-double culture, double language-to which the poet is subjected, is also a reflection of his own society. Indeed, separation is already situated between the maternal rite that gives life, and the patriarchal rite that evokes the son's death (a reference made to Abraham and Ishmael at the work's beginning). The dichotomy is also between "l'archet maternel," the mother's chant, the voice, maternal word, and "l'ecrit explicite," the inescapable word of the father. "De l'archet maternel a mon vouloir, le temps reste fascine par 1'enfance, comme si l'ecriture, en me donnant au monde, recommengait le choc de mon elan, au pli d'un obscur dedoublement (17) 'From the maternal bow to my will, time remains fascinated by childhood, as if writing, while giving birth to me, started up again the shock of my spurting forth, at the fold of an obscur doubling.' If this passage associates with the same nostalgia childhood, the maternal world, word, and writing-encompassing them all-then it also emphasizes the parole premiere, "the initial word," the chant and the music that, once again, the mother stains with her femininity. She appears here as an initiator to the music of words, as she initiates the son into the association of words and music. Likewise, tattoos and henna-practices associated with the feminine-initi- ate the narrator as if they were an "arriere-exercice d'ecrire" (Khatibi, Blessure 88). The two traces appear as the "premiers signes" to a reading of the body. At the same time, the tattoo initiates him to recollection, that is, a memory of the mother. A certain power of fascination is at work in the body's relationship to writing, with a script that possesses the body. La memoire tatouee is the locus of this seductive power of writing which is first and foremost drawn onto the body itself. Khatibi refers repeatedly to the fascination tattoos have over him. A captivating power of the trace, it is the same urge that inscribes the book-parch- ment La memoire tatouee:</page><page sequence="9">Zohra Mezgueldi 9 La rue me prenait, je me faufilais dans le labyrinthe ou tout pouvait jail- lir: des chats errants, des yeux de femmes entre les portes ou pres de la maison, des jnouns derriere les figues de Barbarie. (40) Quelle femme a la main lente nous aurait donne, avec le vif du henne, l'enigme du labyrinthe. (86) Un oeil s'allonge, un autre s'egare, qu'ils soient tous deux impliques jusqu'au feu! Je tatonne pour l'instant, voila le cercle sur les dalles, le tien, une place chaude, une piece plus chaude, une troisieme, bref, a repercuter jusqu'au vertige. (45) The street took me, I used to thread my way through the labyrinth where anything could jump out: stray cats, women's eyes through the doorways or close to the house, genies behind the Barbary figs. What woman with a languid hand would have given us, with the vivid- ness of henna, the enigma of the labyrinth. An eye stretches outward, another wanders, may they both be involved. I grope along for the moment, here is the circle on the pavement, your own, a warm place, a warmer room, a third one, in short, to reflect back until one is dizzy. Thus, the same kind of enchantment will be created through the association among the labyrinth, the bath, and tattoos. Linked by the concept of the trace, these seductive signs provoke dizziness while at the same time symbolizing secu- rity by ensuring the narrator's protection. He feels safeguarded by tattoos (21), protected by the streets and the maze-like medina (52). The same polymorphic movement, related to the curves of a labyrinth, to tattoos, and to the overly ornate letter of which "it is said that it will climb torturously, crashing against the mar- gins" (64-65), evokes this demand for a plural, imaginary word, formulated through the text. The significance of curves is opposed to the rectangular and to the univocality that marks these "journmes d'un temps lineaire, reduites a un espace limite ou le cercle des enfants prisonniers de leurs corps se refermait autour d'une divinite sadique" (40) 'days of linear time, reduced to a limited space where the circle of children, prisoners of their bodies, closed in around a sadistic divinity' are spent in a Koranic school-the epitome of the locus of the dogmatic verb. The work reiterates here the fundamental opposition evoked throughout this study, between the diversity of the realm of the imaginary and of language, and the powers of the patriarchal order. The former is the feminine and maternal realm in which the child and the outcasts from the Verb/writing participate; the latter realm is located on the side of the father, thefquih, and the sacred. It is again within the context of ambiguity that the scriptural trance defines itself, animating the text by its relationship to the female body, around which the fundamental question of creation is unquestionably and fundamentally articulated. The text constantly sets up a correlation between the woman's body, the writing process in its polysemy and polymorphy, the poetic and magical func- tion, the language of the imaginary, and the creative act. The articulation of these elements establishes itself around notions of the illicit and the satanic that are- especially in the Maghrebian context-linked to the woman's body. At the end of</page><page sequence="10">10 Research in African Literatures the scriptural trance, the woman's body is confirmed as the centerpiece around which the text is constructed. In this way, the French language, "a beautiful and evil stranger" (12-13), and writing, "gleaming incest" and "confusion with the mother's body" (Maghreb 191)-as the mother tongue emerges in the text-are articulated around the female figure, split into two so that one is the lover and the other is the mother. This articulation in turn releases the woman's image as a body linked to the satanic and to the forbidden, as well as to creation. If La memoire tatouee total- izes these two aspects-lover and mother-of the female body and confuses them in their reciprocal domination, it also takes into account their rivalry and con- frontations. The itinerary into writing and into language reveals that "to love the Other [through his or her language], is to speak of the lost locus of memory (in its maternal connotations)" (118). Nonetheless, throughout this itinerary in the realm of the possessive language, the mother-word itself (la parole-mere) is fully played out as a locus of protection-talisman: "Certes Occident, je me scinde, mais mon identite est une infinite de jeux, de roses de sable, euphorbe est ma mere, desert est ma mere, oasis est ma mere, je suis protege, Occident!" (187) 'Of course, Occident, I am split apart, but my identity is an infinity of games, of sand roses, euphorbia is my mother, the desert is my mother, the oasis is my mother, I am protected Occident!' Resulting from the union of all of the forms of the body's expression, from this preparatory writing exercise that is the tattoo, to dance-another metaphor for writing-by way of the musicalness of words that absorbs the body, the word appears throughout La memoire tatouee as a vibration and pure emanation from the body. It is the voice made into narrative. A voice that enchants and seduces; it dominates the entire story. It must be noted that the last sentence of La memoire tatouee presents the pair "A" and "B" who only exist through what they say and who take on the consistency of their words, of their voices. Even if the text pro- ceeds, in a sense, from a multiplicity of voices, little by little it winds its way toward a single narrating voice. If writing has taken part in the "detachment" (206) of the self (the "je") in the trance of writing, it also resonates as the song of its reunification at the end of the trance. A locus of its own wearing away, the word "I"-still fundamental-is inevitably a space of instability. Hence, the instability of music, of dance, and of the body's writing. If it constitutes the objective of the self's desire, totality also signifies its death and loss of identity, "at the threshold of insanity" (207). Writing is condemned to wandering! Symbolic indeed, is this scene of the double who merges into another duality (by "B"'s throwing himself into a fresco representing a tattooed woman, 194). Multiple meanings may be determined from this; first of all, it affirms that the "I" can only be conceived of in division, in opposition (double against double) and in confrontation, a struggle with the self. Secondly, it confirms that identity can only be "broached." Identity comes to terms with itself solely at the expense of difference, and, in this case, difference is redoubled. The tattooed woman (in the fresco's background) names the initial "difference." As Khatibi has written: "La difference est une femme et la difference sauvage une seduction larvee" (175) 'Difference is a woman, and sav- age difference is a latent seduction.' The Chinese fresco signifies the "latent seduction" of savage difference, and the scene is also suggestive of repression. Once "B" jumps into the fresco that so fascinates him because of the tattooed</page><page sequence="11">Zohra Mezgueldi 11 woman, he never speaks again, thereby signifying death through the absence of speech. The symbolic presence of the sea, associated with the mother, that "hesitates in the flux" and vacillates from memory to mother, enables the reader to consider this scene as a symbolic representation of the overshadowing of the maternal aspect of identity, of its absorption through writing and it confirms the latter as a consummate scriptural "incest." The pact with the illicit (the stranger, language, the Chinese fresco, and woman), and the fusion with the mother's symbolic body signifies the loss of and the death of the self, absorbed into this dimension of writ- ing. After the disappearance of the identifying part of the work, the text ends with "A"'s formulation of questions, instigating the composition of the text in a movement of rotation: N'ai-je pas rassemble autour de mon cil les reves de votre delivrance? N'ai-je pas fait de mon corps une recreation inquiete et inepuisable? A quand la parole pour tous, O mes invites du jour? (...) Qui vous apprendra a vous tenir debout? Eh quoi! Trahiriez-vous mon enfance et la source de votre pouvoir? Have I not gathered the dreams of your deliverance around my eyelash? Have I not made of my body a worried and inexhaustible recreation? When is the time of words for everyone, my guests of the day? ... Who will teach you to stand upright? What then! Would you betray my child- hood and the source of your power? Therefore, if the study of La memoire tatouee has put forth the power of speech as a fundamental element, unveiled by the text, one that intervenes in the produc- tion of a self-image, it has above all shown that writing makes itself a celebratory principle of the mother-word. The latter has taken part in the scriptural trance and has ultimately revealed itself as the core around which gravitates a writing of desire. As a narrative of a childhood dealing with the mother and an itinerary toward and of language, Tahar Ben Jelloun's Harrouda is a work whose concerns are in line with the focus of this study. In this novel, the city is a textual and scriptural space. Separation and difference are formulated through a topographical layout. These two themes, in turn, are manifested by segregation, power, oppression, and exclusion. The ecriture of the work reveals a difference that is experienced as violence and it appears in different forms as that of the marginalized body. Harrouda opens upon the body, which is made to be even more provocative by the fact of being the most excluded: "Seeing sexual organs was the preoccu- pation of our childhood" (13). The body is the focus of the narrator-scriptor's incitements: Consommez du miel .... Tatouez avec du henne un poisson sur chaque fesse. Teignez le bout des seins avec le safran de Chine. Oignez d'huile d'olive vos cheveux .... Parfumez-vous. (182) Consume honey .... Tattoo a fish on each buttock with henna. Dye the tips of the breasts with saffron from China. Anoint the hair with olive oil .... Scent yourselves.</page><page sequence="12">12 Research in African Literatures In this way, the body is both a basic language and the last word. The text refers constantly to a writing of the body that is inscribed as a locus of deciphering and reading. The terms "tattooing" and "scarring" are used again and again. Tattooing is evoked by three elements: a topographical layout, color symbolism, and a ter- minology that evokes a writing of the body, inviting the reader to read and listen to the body's language. Three types of traces can be discerned upon the topographical body: circular, labyrinth-like, and rectangular. From this perspective, the city of Fez is sufficient unto itself for an analysis of these elements. Within the circularity of its enclosure, Fez contains a labyrinth of streets whose rectangular axis is the shallow river that runs through and divides the city. Each layout in the text possesses its own par- ticular meaning. The wide boulevard, an implacable axis, characterizes the "city of the future" that is associated with a totalitarian discourse in which no side street exists. The rectangular separates, divides, and installs the segregationist differ- ence. Circularity recalls the closed and secure world of the mother. Circularity characterizes the city of Fez as does the closed and reassuring, feminine and maternal universe. The security that it inspires also characterizes the childhood world. Apart from the story, childhood signifies a fantasy world that is experi- enced in the street and the steam baths. The labyrinth-like alleys of Fez evoke the phantasm that the child/narrator seeks in vain to recapture after the destruction of the old city of Fez by the modernity imposed by colonization (62). The entire graphic discourse of the city and of the text challenges the linearity that is too closely linked to univocality, and illustrates instead the sinuous move- ment of the curve as being linked to a vital multiplicity. A language of colors is linked to the symbolism of the grapheme as an expression of desire which under- lies the practice of tattooing. There is a marked predominance of a blue-green color-the color of traditional tattooing-that is associated with loss and desire in Ben Jelloun's text. Blue is here seen as the color of nascent desire; craftsmen are "the sons of the blue dawn with shades of another violence" (87). Unappeased, desire is only writing, the transcription of its repression and its death; this is why the colors that designate it in its beginning also identify the mortal coloration. The mother whose "body consumes itself without ever having seen the sea, adds henna to the blue wing of her silence" (77-78). The hashish smokers, bluish-pink as is the plant that produces them, repress their desires, "yellow after mauve, green after blue" (173). The first of the earthenware jars that descends from the camel's belly is an anthropomorphic symbol of desire and is described as "blue-grass luke- warm," the color of desire. The third jar is "blue-death" (121); desire and death are therefore associated through colors. If the text's ecriture is revealed to be essentially that of the body whose appropriation by another type of writing it denounces, it also liberates another aspect, the most important in my view, which totally escapes capture by the verbal. As a primordial, initial language, the body is also the final word: does not the next-to-last judgment grant this revelational and denunciatory word to the body? The book exalts body language as being essential, which is not without recalling to mind Khatibi's observation that: "les valeurs de la culture populaire sont moins logographiques, plus sensibles a une continuite historique inscrite dans le corps" (Blessure 69) 'the values of popular culture are less logographic, and more sensitive to an historical continuity inscribed in the body.' Harrouda</page><page sequence="13">Zohra Mezgueldi 13 designates the body as the only possible means to express lived experience, time, and history, while denouncing the ineffectiveness of a purely language-based power. As the beginning of the narrative opens on the corporal, it posits at the same time the space of childhood that bears the mark of the fantastic and the phantas- magoric. It is a kingdom of shadow and impenetrability, related both to the being's psyche and to the world of the imagination. The framework of childhood is essen- tially the steam bath and the streets in which an imaginary world is inscribed, one that is highly feminized in the text and is closely linked to a maternal image. The evocation of the baths in the work restores the preponderance that it culturally and socially enjoys in the Maghrebian childhood, particularly that of boys. Childhood is played out alternately inside and outside. The street is posited in the text as the first locus of childhood. If it contrasts, a priori, the external against a matriarchal, uterine interiority that is symbolized by wells, earthenware jars, and the steam baths, then the street is also revealed as a place of phantasm and it thereby partic- ipates in the imaginary world of childhood. The street is corporal; it is Harrouda's favorite space. Thus, all the spaces of childhood are constructed as loci of subversion through both the body and the imaginary. At every turn they are also related to the female body. Occasionally depicting certain characteristics that are analogous to the mother, Harrouda appears most clearly as an antithesis to the mother. As a figure inspired by the folklore character of the ogress, more specifically by the legendary Aicha Kandicha who is alluded to in the work, Harrouda evokes the mythic woman who is closely tied to childhood mythology. The magical dimension of the character reinstates all the ambiguity of the feminine figure as it is experienced by the Maghrebian male. Aicha Kandicha and the stories about ogresses are, in large part, transmitted by women. This is the reason that the relationship of the woman/mother to the mythic and magical woman is discernable in Ben Jelloun's narrative as a phantasm attributed to the female storyteller. It appears in the mother's words evoking a dream (75-77), in which images of satanism and male- diction occupy a central place and are linked to the mother's body-in-revolt, similar to Harrouda's body. The demonic and subversive aspects accorded to the mother who lives out her revolt poorly join up with the fantastic dimension that Harrouda constitutes, in such a manner as to appear to figure as a reverse femi- nine representation conveyed by the woman-narrator's imagination. Harrouda's relationship to the imaginary is indicated from the text's opening, its writing will increasingly depict the character in her fictitious essence as woman-narrative (172 and 180). Harrouda forms the body of the work in which she is delineated, the nar- rative's ending calls this fact to mind. She is there revealed as a disturbing word who breaks open the circle of the discourse of power. The parenthesis that embod- ies her and breaks her absence from the text is depicted as an open word, an initial word-that of the body-rupturing the closed circle, or halqua (180) of speech by introducing a subversive breach. While ousting the hero from religious history (181), she perturbs the closed and powerful discourse of the "man-master of the halqua," the public circle in the marketplace where peddlers and public story- tellers are located. This man sees himself transgress orthodoxy in spite of himself and thereby revives the fantastic tale, restituting Harrouda to her magic depths. A circle of a different nature, which had opened upon Harrouda as a sexual organ,</page><page sequence="14">14 Research in African Literatures closes upon Harrouda-word-narrative, which invests another closure-that of the power of language-operating a virtual extraversion upon a different word. This itinerary of the word appears to target the maternal world, a realm that is secluded and excluded from writing. The mother's space is thereby penetrated by the poet's prose. This, in turn, constitutes another direction of the voyage. If writing fills in the gaps, it appears that in Harrouda the lack of maternal language is seen as being filled by the textual restitution of the imaginary realm that she has so deeply touched. It is the mother's magic and mythic body, the other side of the maternal body, a wound in other respects, that is valorized in the work and through which is situated the very body of the book: Harrouda. As Roland Barthes writes in Le plaisir du texte, "L'ecrivain est quelqu'un qui joue avec le corps de sa mere pour le glorifier, l'embellir..." (60-61) 'The writer is someone who plays with his mother's body in order to glorify it, to beautify it ....' In Harrouda, the mother-word constitutes this maternal language that is exalted in the poet's verb through the writing of the maternal imaginary, reinstated by the character of Harrouda. A clear antagonism comes to light in the texts analyzed in this study between the mother-word revealed as being one of diversity, plurality, of life itself, and as an instrument of creation, against the univocal verb, dogmatic, dominating, and oppressive. The whole of poetic activity tends to translate the meanings and dimensions of the symbolism of the mother-word's realm; that is, to valorize through writing, those signs that society has imprisoned in muteness. Indeed, in these three novels, the function of writing is to assure the perma- nence and continuity of the realm of the mother-word as a locus of identity. It is important to note that in regards to French-language Moroccan literature, the writer's language-based power is founded upon the very strength of the mother- word-a noticeably subversive power that finds its source from within. The power of the mother-word assumes the place occupied by the mother in the constitution and grounding of the imaginary. It is this imaginary that operates in scriptural and poetic activity and in all creative undertakings. -trans. by Patricia Geesey WORKS CITED Barthes, Roland. Le plaisir du texte. Paris: Seuil, 1973.
