<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bernard F. Dukore SHAW'S "BIG THREE" Trilogies are as old as recorded western drama, though only one from ancient Greece survives in its entirety, The Oresteia. While Shaw's first three volumes of plays - Pleasant, Unpleasant, and for Puritans - each cluster around a clearly stated theme, they are trilogies or (the second) a tetral- ogy only in this loose sense. Unlike the Greek work just cited, they do not trace characters or families and they do not represent the introduc- tion, development, and (particularly important) culmination of a theme. In the latter respect - but only, I must caution, in that respect - one can consider Man and Superman, John Bulls Other Island, and Major Barbara - completed in three successive years beginning 1903 - to constitute a tril- ogy. Urging his German translator to publish them in one volume, Shaw called them "the big three."1 Although several critics have related one of them to another to the others, none has exhausted the subject. I lack sufficient hubris to expect this essay to do so; still, I should like to ex- amine them as a trilogy. Inevitably I will repeat what others, including myself, have said on the subject.2 Also inevitably I will take issue with some views. Nevertheless, I hope this treatment of Shaw's "big three" will both tie together ideas already presented and advance somewhat new or different ways of regarding these plays. While Shaw probably did not intend to follow Man and Superman with developments of its thematic implications, much less a culmination, he did so partly because of his writing practice (the preface of one play, written after it, points to the next play) and partly because of the Vedrenne-Barker seasons, which plunged him into play production ac- tivities that absorbed his attention to the exclusion of other matters. Sig- nificantly, it was when "the big three" did so at more or less the same time that he complained he was "too busy rehearsing and producing to attend any publishing business for the moment."3 Consider the chronology. He completed Man and Superman in June 1903, then wrote its preface and published them the same year. On 26 April 1904, at the Court Theatre, J. E. Vedrenne and Granville Barker</page><page sequence="2">34 BERNARD F. DUKORE presented Candida, whose success emboldened them to plan a full sea- son in the fall. Shaw began to write John Bull's Other Island on 17 June 1904, completed it on 23 August, and directed its first production there on 1 November, its revival on 7 February 1905. On 22 March 1905, only a month and a half later, he began the composition of Major Barbara, finished Act I on 4 April, and stopped writing Act II at the point that Undershaft arrives at the Salvation Army shelter. Although Shaw does not date the break-off, it might have been in mid- April. His 9 May letter, just cited, suggests this, as does English rehearsal practice at the time: four weeks was usual, a mere three sometimes necessary. When he stopped work on Barbara he was directing a revival of John Bull, which opened on 1 May 1905. Near the end of these rehearsals or immediately there- after, he rehearsed Superman, which opened on 23 May. During rehears- als oí John Bull, therefore, he probably prepared the blocking of Super- man.4 When he returned to Barbara on 8 July, his head must have resonated with the two earlier plays' dialogue, which he had heard many times during rehearsals and at one or more performances. After a ma- jor revision of Act III, he completed Barbara on 15 October. Under his direction, its first performance took place on 28 November. He himself was aware of the relationship of Barbara to the two earlier plays. He likened it to the last scene in John Bull "spun out for three hours and a half"5 and he compared Tanner (the protagonist oí Superman) to Eurip- ides (Cusins's nickname in Barbara)? According to Louis Crompton, each of these plays is a " 'philosophical comedy'" that "begins as a Molièresque satire on a liberal reformer and then develops into a full-fledged Platonic dialogue."7 Although Shaw's dialectical dramatic dialogue differs from Plato's nondramatic Socratic dialogue, each play does develop into dramatically philosophical dis- course (in the penultimate act of Superman and the last scenes of the others) and each begins as a satire on liberalism. In Superman, Roebuck Ramsden is the liberal; in John Bull, Broadbent; in Barbara, Lady Brito- mart (her family are Whigs, from which the liberals derive) and Ste- phen, who moments after Barbara begins "takes up a Liberal weekly called The Speaker" (111,68). Although time has passed such people by and more progressive ideas have replaced theirs, they consider themselves in the vanguard of mod- ern thought. "I was an advanced man before you were born," Ramsden tells Tanner, who retorts, "I knew it was a long time ago" (11,547). Like Ramsden, Ann cannot understand why Jack considers her views old- fashioned: "You know we have all been brought up to have advanced opinions. Why do you persist in thinking me so narrow minded?" (11,575). Whereas Ramsden argues with Jack, Ann pigeonholes his ideas in a re- spectable niche: a possible seat in Parliament. Broadbent's mind, says</page><page sequence="3">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 35 Larry Doyle, has "all its ideas in watertight compartments and all the compartments warranted impervious to anything it doesnt suit you to understand" (11,913). With convenient incomprehension, Broadbent places Keegan's scathing indictments into an impervious compartment: "They improved my mind: they raised my tone enormously" (11,1021). As Wisenthal recognizes,8 this type of response - invulnerability to in- tellectual opposition - has an autobiographical ring; and he quotes Shaw's Epistle Dedicatory to Superman, "I ... find all the force of my onslaught destroyed by a simple policy of nonresistance." Shaw also points out, more clearly anticipating Broadbent and Keegan, that "the ordinary cit- izen, knowing that an author who is well spoken of by a respectable newspaper must be all right, reads me . . . with undisturbed edification from his own point of view" (11,525-6). In Barbara, Lady Britomart's and Stephen's minds have compartments as watertight as Broadbent's. When Stephen is bewildered that people can differ about morality, for "Right is right; and wrong is wrong; and if a man cannot distinguish them properly, he is either a fool or a rascal: thats all," his mother aptly responds, "Thats my own boy {she pats his cheek)'" (111,76). Outraged by the heterodox views of Undershaft, Cusins, and Barbara, she denounces them as "a vulgar tradesman," "a Jesuit," and "a lunatic." Calmly, Under- shaft characterizes her as "the incarnation of morality. . . . Your con- science is clear and your duty done when you have called everybody names" (111,176). Whereas she resembles Ramsden in this respect, Ste- phen resembles Ann and Broadbent. Impervious to unorthodox ideas, he ignores them: "I have satisfied myself that the business is one of the highest character and a credit to our country" (111,180). In important matters Barbara more fully elucidates and in minor mat- ters it picks up themes and threads of its two predecessors. Introducing the Sierra brigands in Superman, Shaw's stage direction enunciates two prominent themes oí Barbara, the Kantian test and the virtue of money: "We misuse our laborers horribly; and when a man refuses to be misused, we have no right to say that he is refusing honest work." If four-fifths of us applied for relief, we would "knock the whole social system to pieces with beneficial reconstructive results." When a man, "applying the Kantian test," declares that "If everybody did as I do, the world would be compelled to reform itself industrially, and abolish slavery and squalor, which exist only because everybody does as you do, let us honor that man and seriously consider the advisability of following his example. Such a man is the ablebodied, ableminded pauper? With the alternatives of "living mainly at the expense of the community and allowing the community to live mainly at his, it would be folly to accept what is to him personally the greater of the two evils" (11,615). In Barbara, Shaw goes fur- ther. "The sensible course," he says in its preface, is "to give every man enough to live well on, so as to guarantee the community against the</page><page sequence="4">36 BERNARD F. DUKORE possibility of the malignant disease of poverty, and then (necessarily) to see that he earned it." In the next sentence he calls poverty a crime and in the play Undershaft echoes him. Elaborating on his earlier stage di- rection, Shaw calls the millionaire armaments maker a man who, having grasped the fact that poverty is a crime, knows that when society offered him the alternative of poverty or a lucrative trade in death and destruction, it offered him, not a choice between opulent villainy and humble virtue, but between energetic enterprise and cow- ardly infamy. His conduct stands the Kantian test, which Peter Shirley's does not. Peter Shirley is what we call the honest poor man. Undershaft is what we call the wicked rich one. . . . If most people behaved as Undershaft does, not as Shirley does, the immediate result "would be a revolution of incalculable beneficence" (111,26-27). Since the common man's high regard of money "is the one hopeful fact in our civilization," everyone's first duty is to insist on hav- ing it on reasonable terms, which do not include making most people drudge ten or twelve hours for a few shillings while a few receive thou- sands for doing nothing. The "evil to be attacked is ... simply poverty" (111,30-31). Superman and Barbara have self-made capitalists, Hector Malone, Sr. and Undershaft, and in John Bull Larry, having "fought his way up through . . . poverty" (11,810), has shares in a capitalist enterprise. The parents, Malone and Undershaft, display a horror of poverty, from which they would save their children. When the younger Malone rejects his father's remittances, the parent pleads with him: "you dont know what poverty is. ... I'd rather you quarrelled and took the money than made friends and starved. You dont know what the world is: I do" (11,710). Upon learning that Cusins and Barbara are "in love with the common people," Undershaft turns "cold and sardonic" for he knows that because poverty brings dirt, disease, and suffering, such love "may please an earl's grand- daughter and a university professor; but I have been a common man and a poor man; and it has no romance for me" (111,121). The money of each parent has saved his child from the ravages of poverty. "Unashamed," Undershaft's motto and one of the first things we learn about him (111,73), is anticipated by Jack, who attributes his appearance of impudence to his lack of shame. The name of Undershaft's partner, Lazarus, echoes Superman, in which Mendoza remarks that Louisa Straker recommended he marry Rebecca Lazarus. Before Shaw completed Superman, General William Booth and the Salvation Army were on his mind. One of his letters refers to Booth, another to Max Beerbohm's caricature of Shaw in a Salvation Army uniform.9 John Bull, too, anticipates Barbara. Hodson's chastisement of Matt Haf-</page><page sequence="5">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 37 figan forecasts the later play's second act, including Bill Walker's thrice- stated taunt, "Wot prawce selvytion nah?" (111,132,137-38): "Well, wot prawce maw grenfawther, Oi should lawk to knaow, that fitted ap a fust clawss shop and built up a fust clawss dripery business in London by sixty years work, and then was chacked aht of it on is ed at the end of is lease withaht a penny for his goodwill." Whereas an Irish farmer cannot be evicted for nonpayment of rent for eighteen months, Hodson was evicted, in winter, after four weeks. "They took the door off its seshes on me, and gev maw wawf pnoomownia. Oi'm a widower nah" (11,975). Whereas in John Bull William Morris's phrase "no man is good enough to be another man's master" appears in the preface (11,870), in Barbara it is in the play, a report that it stands "in mosaic letters ten feet high round the dome" of the William Morris Labor Church (111,162). In all three plays wealthy, powerful classes of England confront beings alien to them: the Americans in Superman, the Irish in John Bull, the poor in Barbara. Even the aliens in Superman and Barbara link to Ireland: the senior Malone was born there and Snobby Price was named for an Irish Chartist, Bronterre O'Brien. In all three, marriage and practical busi- ness matters interweave. "You can be as romantic as you please about love, Hector," says Violet; "but you mustnt be romantic about money" (11,607). Ann aptly calls her "hard as nails . . . and businesslike" (11,717). Whereas Violet marries an heir, Broadbent becomes engaged to Ross- cullen's "only heiress" (11,1010), whom he will put to work on his politi- cal campaign. Barbara is engaged to a man who becomes an heir and Lady Britomart determines that before her daughters marry, her es- tranged husband will settle substantial sums of money on them. Capitalism is clearly a major theme of all three plays, though each treats it differently. In Barbara an ultra-capitalist transcends the usual turn-of-the-century capitalism, laying the groundwork for its superses- sion. "Property, says Proudhon, is theft," cites Tanner in The Revolution- ist's Handbook, and he calls the phrase a "perfect truism" (11,787). In this handbook, though not always in the play, Tanner speaks for Shaw, who declares that "our property is organized robbery" (111,51) and explicitly, "Proudhon was right when he defined property as theft." 10 The brigand Mendoza, whose "principles are thoroughly commercial," has syndi- cated himself as "Mendoza, Limited," i.e., since capitalism is theft, Shaw makes a thief a capitalist. Driving the point home, he has the capitalist Malone purchase shares in Mendoza, Ltd. and has Jack call them "the two brigands" (11,627,712-13,719). Malone regards everything, mar- riage included, in terms of profit. If his son marries an English aristo- crat, he will buy any historic house, castle, or abbey for him and give him the money to maintain it. He will do the same if his son marries a woman as poor as his grandmother. "Let him raise himself socially with</page><page sequence="6">38 BERNARD F. DUKORE my money or raise somebody else: so long as there is a social profit somewhere, I'll regard my expenditure as justified" (11,703). This link between capitalism and marriage is significant because the play's chief exemplar of capitalism is a woman, Ann. As E. Strauss ob- serves, Shaw "uses love-relations almost regularly as an illustration and as a small-scale model of social relations." Ann "stands for . . . capitalist society."11 In the sphere of marriage she does what the capitalist does in the marketplace. In a letter composed while Shaw neared the comple- tion of Superman, he couples imperialistic capitalism with Ann: "What is the use of being bright, subtle, witty, genial, if these qualities lead to the subjection and poverty of India and Ireland, and to the political anarchy and corruption of the United States? What says my beautiful, vital, vic- torious, odious-to-all-good-Americans Miss Ann Whitefield? 'The only really simple thing is to go straight for what you want and grab it.' " 12 As Strauss perceives, "Ann is the perfection of the possessive or acquisitive woman." 13 John Bull personifies capitalism as Broadbent, who Sean O'Casey says would "take away even the green flag round Ireland's middle and turn it into a gilt-edged security." 14 Politically, and more important economi- cally, this acquisitive man grabs Ireland - symbolized by the poverty- stricken village of Rosscullen - as a potentially profitable commodity. As Maurice Valency notes, Rosscullen also represents "the brutalizing ef- fects of a long tradition of oppression and exploitation, a tradition the residents secretly respect and hope to emulate when they are sufficiently advanced themselves." 15 Rather than overthrow capitalism, its agrarian victims - like their urban counterparts, such as Lickcheese in Shaw's first play, Widowers' Houses - would become capitalists themselves. As Larry knows, those farmers who own little acreage are as greedy and oppres- sive "to them that have no land at all" as the former landlord was (11,962). Once Broadbent's syndicate, in which Larry has shares, controls Ross- cullen, matters will worsen. Broadbent visits Ireland not for sentimen- tality but for business: to develop an estate for the syndicate and to ex- amine property it acquired when it foreclosed a mortgage. Larry admits he was taken aback by the foreclosure since when he was a boy he liked the mortgagee, but Broadbent's explanation of failure to pay interest stops any argument from Larry, who is truly his partner. In the original manuscript, Shaw is more explicit that the Garden City Broadbent claims he would make of Rosscullen is for capitalist exploitation: he calls the Garden City plan a dodge, refutes the notion that the idea has turned him into a socialist, and says that his method will require no outlay of capital since the enthusiastic voluntarism of warmhearted Irishmen, not labor for decent wages, would do the job.16 The play's final scene clarifies the syndicate's plans. Broadbent would</page><page sequence="7">Shaw's "big three" 39 create a hotel and golf course in Rosscullen and sell weekend excursion packages. He reveals that "to all intents and purposes the syndicate I represent already owns half Rosscullen" and within a month will hold mortgages to the other half (11,1011-12). He will lend landowners so much more than their property is worth that the syndicate will foreclose the mortgages when they cannot pay the interest. Through Broadbent, the syndicate will exploit Rosscullen for more profit than its present landowners do. The people will be jailed, bought, tamed, and used to help the syndicate plunder. Larry proposes a humane solution for people like Haffigan: "we'll employ him in some capacity or other, and probably pay him more than he makes for himself now." When Broadbent dis- agrees - "No no: Haffigan's too old. It really doesnt pay now to take on men over forty even for unskilled labor, which I suppose is all Haffigan would be good for. . . . He's worked out, you know" - Larry instantly submits: "Haffigan doesnt matter much. He'll die presently. ... I say let him die, and let us have no more of his like." So much for Haffigan, whose fate Shaw will show in Barbara in the person of Peter Shirley. So much too for Larry's high-sounding hopes for Ireland, eloquently ex- pressed in an earlier scene, and for his good will, no more than phrase- making. "Well," he admits, with telling use of the possessive plural, "our syndicate has no conscience" (11,1013-14). Keegan predicts it will squeeze all it can from the community, engineer all phases of Rosscullen's rise and decline, and make its wretchedness more orderly. After the hotel becomes insolvent and liquidated, he continues, the syndicate will ruin its stockholders by acquiring it for a few shillings to the pound, foreclose mortgages, drive Rossculleners worthless to it to America or death, and employ some who remain to bully others who remain. Like Ann and Broadbent, Undershaft is an acquisitive type who goes straight for what he wants and grabs it. Some of his most effective ar- guments are demonstrations by action. After explaining how the Salva- tion Army helps capitalists, he clinches the argument by acting accord- ing to Ann's precept: he "buys" the Army. Although he tells Cusins he can do so, he presents no verbal argument to support his assertion; he simply does it. If your religion fails to fit the facts, he pragmatically advises Barbara, scrap it and grab one that does. He challenges her to bring Bill Walker to him so that he can save him not by preaching but by action: giving him a well-paying, permanent job. An exchange between Rummy Mitchens and Snobby Price recalls Tanner's paraphrase of Proudhon: "You know what ladies and gentle- men are." "Thievin swine!" (111,97). Cusins explains Lomax's remark about Undershaft, "a bit thick," by a reference in Homer's Iliad to a bur- glar who enters a thickly or strongly built house (111,81). Shaw may have recalled these references, and the Mendoza-Malone enterprise, in the</page><page sequence="8">40 BERNARD F. DUKORE preface to Barbara: "The faults of the burglar are the qualities of the financier" (111,47). The statement anticipates Heartbreak House, where a burglar and a capitalist are called "the two burglars" and "the two prac- tical men of business" (V,181).17 Although Undershaft is not and does not call himself a gentleman, he is, as capitalist, a "thievin swine " Among other things, Perivale St Andrews represents what Stephen calls "colos- sal capital" (111,159). Every aspect, however much it may benefit work- ers, Undershaft boasts, results in "a colossal profit, which comes to me" (111,155). Moreover, "the spectacle of his successes in making money [gives] great satisfaction to the huge majority who have rather less chance of achieving it themselves than of winning the Calcutta Sweep" (111,200). He can afford to flout William Morris's egalitarian maxim since his em- ployees "take no more notice of it than of the ten commandments in church" (111,162-63). In his screenplay, Shaw expands this point. Sedi- tious speeches in the Labor Church are "the Undershaft safety valve. Our people can talk here; and as long as men can talk politics they will never do anything else except work for their daily bread." 18 Shaw takes pains to remind spectators and readers of what Under- shaft represents. "/ am the government of your country," he tells his son "with a touch of brutality? and Parliament and people will do what profits his firm. Parliament will wage war when it suits him and keep peace when it does not. Only after he decides on measures necessary for bus- iness will it learn of them. When he wants to raise his firm's profits, the country will find that his want is a national need. When others want to lower them, the country will call out the military and constabulary. In return, his newspapers will support, applaud, and make politicians imagine they are great statesmen. He scornfully derides political parties and newspaper articles as "toys" and emphatically concludes that be- cause he pays the piper he calls the tunes (111,151-52). Shaw has Undershaft display this "touch of brutality" elsewhere, both verbally and visually. Giving Mrs. Baines his check, he brutally reminds Cusins and Barbara, who listen, that his largesse comes from widows and orphans, mutilated and dead soldiers, and oceans of blood. Visually, Shaw displays it in Act III: "Several dummy soldiers more or less mutilated, with straw protruding from their gashes, have been shoved out of the way under the landing. A few others are nearly upright against the shed; and one has fallen forward and lies, like a grotesque corpse, on the emplacement? He reports that his latest weapon has demolished a fort with three hundred soldiers in it. "Dummy soldiers?" asks Cusins, alluding to those lying on stage - life-size, the reader should remember and the spectator would see. Un- dershaft responds, "(striding across to Stephen and kicking the prostrate dummy brutally out of his way) No: the real thing" (III, 157-59). 19</page><page sequence="9">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 41 For all three exemplars of acquisitiveness, Shaw uses diabolonian im- agery. Jack calls Ann "Lady Mephistopheles" and says she has "a devilish charm" (11,578). Doran says that Broadbent "has the divil's own luck" and Keegan calls him "an efficient devil" (11,983,1015), which may be one reason that he rather than Keegan feels at home in a world Keegan regards as hell. Ann tempts Jack; the Devil is widely known as the temp- ter. While Broadbent tempts the villagers, Keegan sees through his temptations. Like Keegan, Cusins explicitly labels the capitalist "clever, clever devil" and "tempter, cunning tempter"; and Cusins frequently calls Undershaft such names as "Mephistopheles" and "the Prince of Darkness" (111,156,178,124,142). But when Barbara describes his fac- tory town as a "Works Department of Hell," he is "scandalized" (111,154) and points to the presence of chapels, churches, and an ethical society. This tempter is a devil with a difference. Perhaps to hint at the irony of such titles in this play, Shaw in the preface calls him "St Andrew Undershaft" (111,23). In the last play of this trilogy, the exemplar of acquisitiveness transcends the capitalism that results in the poverty of Rosscullen and West Ham. So far, I have emphasized his affinities to that capitalism because some critics neglect them and, following Shaw's unfortunate allusion to him as "the hero of Major Barbara" (111,27), consider him its raisonneur - which he is only to an extent, since Cusins and Barbara also speak for Shaw. The fore- going should demonstrate the incompleteness of such views. What fol- lows should demonstrate that while they are partly correct, the part is less than the whole. "What is the matter with the poor is Poverty," says Tanner's Handbook (11,794). Undershaft gives his workers well-paying jobs that adequately feed, clothe, and house them. Conscious that "the greatest of our evils, and the worst of our crimes is poverty" (111,23), he has removed "the matter." Shaw would have people "liquidate' the underfed either by feeding them or killing them" (111,63). "Poverty blights whole cities," says Undershaft, "spreads horrible pestilences," and poisons the non- poor, who "organize unnatural cruelties for fear [the poor] should rise against us and drag us down into their abyss" (111,172). He speaks for Shaw, who similarly declares that "Let Him Be Poor" means let him be weak, ignorant, a nucleus of disease, an exhibition of dirt, and a parent of rickety children. It means "Let his habitations turn our cities into poisonous congeries of slums. Let his daughters infect our young men with the diseases of the streets, and his sons revenge him by turning the nation's manhood into scrofula, cowardice, cruelty, hypocrisy, political imbecility, and all the other fruits of oppression and malnutrition." Ap- pealing to our selfish as well as our unselfish instincts, he concludes that</page><page sequence="10">42 BERN ARD F. DU KÖRE it is unwise for those not poor to permit poverty (111,25). Because one can destroy it under capitalism, why delay? Partly to emphasize his ar- gument, he makes the killer of poverty a weapons maker. Undershaft is a benevolent capitalist, with equal emphasis on adjective and noun. He has organized his microcosmic society to eliminate pov- erty - an example to the nation. There, he transcends capitalism by cre- ating social conditions that permit his workers to do more than drudge for their daily bread. "The virtues of Broadbent," says Shaw, "are not less real because they are the virtues of the money that coal and iron have produced" (11,810). Mutatis mutandis, the virtues of Undershaft are not less real because they are products of capitalism and armaments. From the mouths of fools, truth sometimes emerges. As Lomax says, "there is a certain amount of tosh about this notion of wickedness. It doesnt work. You must look at facts" (111,175-76). The most prominent fact is what Undershaft has done. Except for him, and perhaps old Malone, these acquisitive types are hypocrites. Ann, says Jack, has "absolutely no conscience - only hypoc- risy" (II, 567). Keegan indicts Broadbent: "I know you are quite sin- cere." Deliberately, he misquotes Scripture to characterize Broadbent's hypocrisy: "Let not the right side of your brain know what the left side doeth" (11,989). While Broadbent denounces "the windbags, the carpet- baggers, the charlatans, the . . . fools and ignoramuses," he never dreams he denounces himself; rather, he considers himself a man "with no humbug about him, who will . . . take his stand on the solid ground of principle and public duty" (11,988). Yet his talk is humbug, his principles and sense of public duty are for corporate gain, and his promise of prosperity will economically shackle the younger workers and exile or starve the older. In developing an estate in Rosscullen for the syndicate, he claims he would "take a little money out of England and spend it in Ireland" (11,899). Not quite: he will invest money in Ireland to take more money from it. His partner, too, is a hypocrite. Although Larry declares, "I wish I could find a country to live in where the facts were not brutal and the dreams not unreal," he does nothing to alter the brutalized facts or realize the dreams. He condemns avaricious landowners whom soci- ety does not call to account but fails to condemn the syndicate, which society also does not call to account. This Irish émigré to England and his partner, the English émigré to Ireland, proclaim high motives while they work for self-interest. By contrast, the "unashamed" Undershaft admits he is "a profiteer in mutilation and murder" and unlike Broad- bent is not "one of those men who keep their morals and their business in water-tight compartments" (111,89). Despite Undershaft's benevolence, his elimination of poverty, and the possibility that his actions may one day result in the supersession of cap-</page><page sequence="11">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 43 i tali s m, he does not in Shaw's view represent the ultimate in social well- being. As indicated earlier, Shaw takes pains to emphasize how he is detrimental to the general welfare - for example, the passage that ex- plains his firm to be the real government of England. "I am, and have always been, and shall now always be, a revolutionary writer," Shaw af- firms in the same preface in which he calls Undershaft a saint and the play's hero, thereby suggesting his approval of the capitalist is limited to the reasons he gives, "because our laws make law impossible; our liber- ties destroy all freedom; our property is organized robbery; our moral- ity is an impudent hypocrisy; our wisdom is administered by inexperi- enced or malexperienced dupes, our power wielded by cowards and weaklings, and our honor false in all its points. I am an enemy of the existing order" (111,59). As Lenin's famous pamphlet asks, what is to be done? Shaw's response is not that of a character of his countryman Sam- uel Beckett, the first line of Waiting for Godot, that nothing is to be done (a phrase with chiefly metaphysical resonances but also recalling Lenin's question). Very likely, Keegan's view, "when we cease to do, we cease to live" (11,1018), is Shaw's. One might do as Tanner does, write a pamphlet to influence people. Its disposition on stage (Ramsden vehemently throws it into a waste pa- per basket) may be seen to represent its general reception. Although Shaw wrote pamphlets and books on socialism, he did not delude him- self as to their effectiveness. Rather, "hard words, even when uttered by eloquent essayists and lecturers, or carried unanimously at enthusiastic public meetings on the motion of eminent reformers" - and he was all three - "break no bones." Disputing the idea that Voltaire, Rousseau, and the Encyclopedists created the French Revolution (which in pre- Soviet 1907, when Barbara was published, exemplified revolution), he calls it "the work of men who had observed that virtuous indignation, caustic criticism, conclusive argument and instructive pamphleteering, even when done by the most earnest and witty literary geniuses, were as useless as praying. . . ." Although Shaw himself is this type of genius, he is too intellectually honest to spare himself: "I, who have preached and pamphleteered like any Encyclopedist, have to confess that my methods are no use," for they succeed "only in giving cowards all the sensations of heroes" while they submit to oppression (111,37-39). And journalism, which reaches more people than pamphlets and books, is a profession for people like Stephen. What of practical politics in a democracy? Shaw was ambivalent: while it might accomplish some good, it is ineffective as the sole means to cre- ate socialism. Fabian policy derives from an 1887 manifesto that says, "Socialism may be most quickly and most surely realized by utilizing the political power already possessed by the people . . . and to bring it to</page><page sequence="12">44 BERNARD F. DUKORE bear upon Parliament, municipalities, and other representative bod- ies. . . "20 Although Shaw increasingly considered Parliament as less and less effective, he increasingly respected municipal organizations, which worked on local levels, as more and more effective. From May 1897 to November 1900, Shaw was a St. Paneras vestryman, and a borough councillor there until October 1903. But he recognized that piecemeal reforms, though necessary, did not substitute for complete social re- structure. While working at St. Paneras and writing Superman, he real- ized how fundamentally useless parliamentary methods were: "at no moment during the whole boom of Socialism was it possible to infer from the fact of a man being a Socialist how he would vote in any Par- liamentary division." Socialists in Parliament even failed to impress the public of any new element there. To call a man a socialist "conveys just as much information about him . . . [as] the statement that he is a Chris- tian."21 In Superman, when Ann proposes that Jack enter Parliament, "He col- lapses like a pricked bladder" (11,575). This does not mean he will adopt her proposal. In fact, he provokes it by declaring that since mobs of voters are worse educated than statesmen, public men who must win their votes are unlikely to create a better world. His Handbook maintains, "Democracy substitutes election by the incompetent many for appoint- ment by the corrupt few" (11,782). Whereas politicians once had to flat- ter kings, they now must "fascinate, amuse, coax, humbug, frighten, or otherwise strike the fancy of the electorate" - skills that differ from those required to legislate for its best interests. Because "the demagogue . . . professes (and fails) to readjust matters in the interests of the majority of the electors" and fails to learn how to manage a county parish, let alone international affairs, "the whole political business goes to smash" (11,754-55). Anticipating Barbara, the Devil indicts a parliamentary sys- tem that caters to mass ignorance: "Over . . . battles the people run about the streets yelling with delight, and egg their Governments on to spend hundreds of millions of money in the slaughter, whilst the strongest Ministers dare not spend an extra penny in the pound against the pov- erty and pestilence through which they themselves daily walk" (11,655-56). As I said, Shaw was ambivalent about practical politics. After Super- man, he became a candidate not for the ineffective Parliament but for the effective London County Council for the borough of St. Paneras. In the election of 5 March 1904, he was third among four candidates, with fewer than fifty votes separating him from the fourth. Three months later he began to write John Bull, whose subjects include the type of person who wins elections and the type who should avoid them. The latter is Larry Doyle - like Shaw an anglicized Irishman, a man with "ideas . . . not . . . popular enough" for the electorate or for those who provide financial backing, "not a Liberal," and impatient with</page><page sequence="13">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 45 those Irish who are "duped by Acts of Parliament that change nothing but the necktie of the man that picks [their] pocket" (11,957,964-65). By contrast, the liberal Broadbent, who stands for Home Rule (chang- ing to green the necktie of the pickpocket), is the successful type of candidate. The Rosscullen landowners want an M.P. who will support them and "doesnt care a snap of his fingers for the shoutn o the riff-raff in the towns, or for the foolishness of the laborers" (11,959). Broadbent is for retrenchment, defined as reduction of property taxes, and reform, defined as "maintaining those reforms which have already been con- ferred . . . and trusting for future developments to the free activity of a free people on the basis of those reforms." Doran understands the meaning of this doubletalk: "No more meddlin" (11,967-68). Shrewdly, Keegan appraises Broadbent's chances of victory as "excellent. . . . You will get into parliament because you want to get into it enough to be prepared to take the necessary steps to induce the people to vote for you" (11,988). Among the steps is to put his fiancée to work for him by calling on voters' wives: "theyll be flattered no end by your calling, es- pecially as youve never cheapened yourself by speaking to them be- fore - have you?" (11,1006). Father Dempsey observes, "he hasn't much sense" (11,970), but even a sensible politician must behave as he does. As Shaw says in the preface to John Bull, "Every English statesman has to maintain his popularity by pretending to be ruder, more ignorant, more sentimental, more superstitious, more stupid than any man who has lived behind the scenes of public life for ten minutes can possibly be" (11,818-19). In Barbara, he dismisses politics as fit for someone like Stephen, who "knows nothing and thinks he knows everything" (111,151). The final scene shows contempt for Parliament as an instrument of significant social change: UNDERSHAFT. . . . Your pious mob fills up ballot papers and imagines it is governing its masters; but the ballot paper that really governs is the paper that has a bullet wrapped in it. CUSINS. That is perhaps why, like most intelligent people, I never vote. UNDERSHAFT. Vote! Bah! When you vote, you only change the names of the cabinet. When you shoot, you pull down governments, inaugurate new epochs, abolish old orders and set up new. Cusins concedes, "It is historically true" (111,174). But let us remember Shaw's ambivalence, which is practical. As Eric Bentley perceives, Shaw "operates on two time-tables: the short and the long range."22 On the short range, unlike most intelligent people Cusins knows, Shaw votes for the least objectionable candidate; on the longer, he works toward social- ist revolution. To Shaw, people will revolt only when they have been educated to</page><page sequence="14">46 BERNARD F. DUKORE want socialism, and he believes revolution to be essential. Thus, in the preface to Barbara: "it is for the poor to repudiate poverty when they have had enough of it" (111,28). He felt "when" had not arrived. The Revolutionist's Handbook says that the Fabian Society's peaceful, constitu- tional policy of socialism is favorably regarded because of the belief "that the Fabians, by eliminating the element of intimidation from the Social- ist agitation, have . . . saved the existing order from the only method of attack it fears" (11,760). I disagree with Turco that Shaw uses Tanner "to sidestep the suggestion that these sentiments were his own" and that it was not until he wrote Barbara that "the gist of 'Tanner's' argument must have struck root in his mind. . . ."23 As early as 1890, Shaw expressed himself similarly: some of the Fabians' "recently acquired middle class vogue is due to an impression that we have found a way of making so- cialism an excuse for exhorting the working class not to do anything rash." But Parliament will pass measures favorable to workers "only when they are convinced that otherwise a worse thing will befall them; and nothing can convince them of that except the determination of the workers to resort to force if Parliament fails."24 Constitutionalism and violence, Shaw believed, are not mutually exclusive. The former is the first stage of the long process to prepare English workers to overthrow capitalism by force. Thus, Tanner's question: "of what use is it to substitute the way of the reckless and bloodyminded for the way of the cautious and hu- mane?" (11,762). At that time, it would have been useless, since too few English workers were ready to storm the barricades. What, then, are we to make of Shaw-Tanner's assertion that both Fa- bian and barricades methods "are fundamentally futile" (11,761)? The explanation involves the Life Force and the Superman. As Eric Bentley says, these ideas provide the main link between Bernard Shaw's politics and his religion. Shaw had begun with socialist ethics, according to which you must change society in order to change man. The trouble was that unless you changed man he refused to change society. Shaw's way out was ... [to ask] for change from within, not instead but as well. Shaw said, moreover, that you could not have democracy until everyone is a Superman. He did not say you could not have socialism till then.25 In 1896, Shaw had insisted on socialism's limitations: "The Fabian Soci- ety does not put Socialism forward as a panacea for the ills of human society, but only for those produced by defective organization of indus- try and by a radically bad distribution of wealth."26 On the short range Shaw votes as a Fabian does; on the longer range he plans socialist rev- olution; but he has a still longer range: to help the Life Force work toward Superman. On this range peaceful Fabianism and warlike bar-</page><page sequence="15">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 47 ricadism are futile. Further progress requires a new type of human being, the Superman. In Superman Shaw presents the theory, in John Bull the status quo to be fought, and in Barbara a recapitulation of both plus the culminating, anticipated fusion of change from without as well as within. Shaw's politics are religious, his religion political. As the Handbook states, "The need for the Superman is, in its most imperative aspect, a political one" and "The only fundamental and possible Socialism is the sociali- zation of the selective breeding of Man: in other terms, of humane evo- lution. We must eliminate the Yahoo, or his vote will wreck the common- wealth" (11,753,776). Like Tanner, who calls for "a Democracy of Supermen" (11,755), Shaw asserts, "We must either breed political ca- pacity or be ruined by Democracy, which was forced on us by the failure of the older alternatives" (11,514-15). While political, the play is reli- gious, "for the vision of hell in the third act ... is expressly intended to be a revelation of the modern religion of evolution" (11,531). This so- cialist preaches with such religious fervor that his Epistle Dedicatory to Superman points toward Keegan and Barbara: "my conscience is the gen- uine pulpit article: it annoys me to see people comfortable when they ought to be uncomfortable; and I insist on making them think in order to bring them to conviction of sin" (11,495). To Shaw, life is an underlying force - unfinished, experimenting and blundering, struggling for perfection by trial and error, not the product of an anthropomorphic being. Life aims to create "higher and higher individuals" in order to "attain not only self-consciousness but self- understanding" (11,662-63). Mind permits choice of "the line of great- est advantage instead of yielding in the direction of least resistance" (11,685), as Juan puts it, and he has learned to say not only "I am; there- fore I think" but also "I would think more; therefore I must be more" (11,667). Thus, he chooses the line toward Superman. Politics and religion link with sex, where "the initiative . . . remains with Woman" (11,512), who is irresistible. Echoing Juan's perception, "When the lady's instinct was set on me, there was nothing for it but lifelong servitude or flight" (11,678), Jack ironically remarks that he will marry Ann whether he likes it or not. Since a woman's purpose is not her own, personally, "but that of the whole universe, a man is nothing to [her] but an instrument of that purpose," which enables her to sacri- fice him to it (11,556). As Juan says, "Sexually, Woman is Nature's con- trivance for perpetuating its highest achievement. Sexually, Man is Woman's contrivance for fulfilling Nature's behest in the most econom- ical way." But note: "I said nothing about a woman's whole mind. I spoke of her view of Man as a separate sex" (11,659). In terms other than sex, both superior man and superior woman - such as Barbara and Cusins - can be artist-philosophers (11,509-10), who</page><page sequence="16">48 BERNARD F. DUKORE Shaw says "are the only sort of artists I take quite seriously" (11,519). Such people are as unscrupulous as the mother-woman and would sac- rifice spouse, children, and parents "if only the sacrifice of them enable [these people] to act Hamlet better, to paint a finer picture, to write a deeper poem, a greater play, a profounder philosophy!" (11,557). Thus, Cusins accepts the inheritance though it might mean losing Barbara; and if he had not accepted it she would have given him up in favor of the man who had. The goal of these artists "is to shew us ourselves as we really are. Our minds are nothing but this knowledge of ourselves; and he who adds a jot to such knowledge creates new mind as surely as any woman creates new men" (11,558). But this creator need not be an artist in a literal sense. More aptly, Juan calls him "the philosophic man: he who seeks in contemplation to discover the inner will of the world, in invention to discover the means of fulfilling that will, and in action to do that will by the so discovered means" (11,664). This is possible in the heaven that Juan seeks and to which not only artists like Rembrandt go but also philosophers like Nietzsche. The philosophic man may work at political science, which "means nothing else than the devizing of the best ways of fulfilling the will of the world" (111,480). As Shaw told students at the London School of Economics and Political Science shortly after Barbara had opened, "Intelligence and providence are what the Life Force drives at above all things at present." These students "have in hand the pressing business of conquering for the Life Force a larger, higher, more intelligent, more comprehensive consciousness of the race; and in con- tributing anything new . . . [they] are adding to that consciousness." As a philosopher, you cannot isolate political science as a limited aspect of the Life Force. "Every economic problem will be found to rest on a moral problem: you cannot get away from it. The moment you touch life at any point you raise numbers of moral problems of all kinds. ... As Ma- jor Barbara says, 'Life is all one.'"27 Juan is a higher personification than Jack of the philosophic man through which the Life Force works. But what he is to Jack, Jack is to Ramsden, Keegan to Broadbent and Doyle, they to the Rossculleners, Undershaft to those at Wilton Crescent and West Ham, and Cusins and Barbara to him. Undershaft is more powerful than Broadbent and Doyle, who are more powerful than the capitalists of Superman. Furthermore, even the acquisitive Undershaft is an agent of the Life Force. Like Cu- sins and Barbara, he conforms to Juan's description of the philosophic man: contemplating the will of the world, trying to discover how to ful- fill it, and then doing it. But the union of Cusins and Barbara promises to supersede him in greater understanding, or in Juan's terms thinking more, thereby being more, thereby doing more. Writing about himself in the third person, Shaw says that the final</page><page sequence="17">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 49 scene of Superman "in which the hero revolts from marriage and struggles against it without any hope of escape is a poignantly sincere utterance which must have come from personal experience. . . . Tanner, with all his extravagances, is first hand: Shaw would probably not deny it and would not be believed if he did."28 The extent to which this is accurate relates to how one considers Jack's fate. If inaccurate, note that when Shaw wrote Superman he lacked political and theatrical success in his adopted country. Perhaps he displaced his own professional failure into Jack's personal failure. With either interpretation, he may have dis- guised a cry from the heart as a laugh from the heart. Like Shaw, Jack enjoys talking and he often echoes Shaw. Like Jack, whom Ramsden reproaches, Shaw lacks shame or modesty, for which his critics reproach him. Anticipating Tanner, he repudiates "mock-modesty" in his preface to Three Plays for Puritans. "I am ashamed neither of my work nor of the way it is done. I like explaining its merits to the huge majority who dont know good work from bad" (11,30). "A little moderation," Straker im- plores his employer (11,588). Shaw too can be immoderate. On the same page of the preface to Puritans, he cries, "I am a natural-born mounte- bank. . . . The cart and trumpet for me." But how different they are. Ann calls Jack "headstrong" (11,561), not really an apt description of Shaw. In the Epistle Dedicatory to Superman, possibly to hint at dissimilarities to Jack, he describes himself (apparently accurately) as "a reasonable, patient, consistent, apologetic, laborious person, with the temperament of a schoolmaster and the pursuits of a vestryman" (11,494). Jack calls marriage "apostasy, profanation of the sanctuary of my soul, violation of my manhood, sale of my birthright, shameful surrender, ignominious capitulation, acceptance of defeat" (11,726). By contrast, Shaw writes to Charlotte before their marriage: "Keep me advised of your address; keep me deep in your heart; write me two lines whenever you love me" and "I will try to find out when your train is due on Sunday night; and if the hour is not absolutely scandalous I shall present myself at the Terrace &amp; crush you in all your ribs with an embrace that has been accumulating for 2 months."29 While Shaw has Jack say that marriage would mean the end of his social pur- posefulness, it meant no such thing for Shaw. If it had, he would not have gone to the effort of composing the two-plays-in-one Superman to- gether with a prefatory epistle and the hero's book as appendix. Con- sider too Shaw's activities while he wrote it: a member of the St. Paneras Borough Council, he spent his afternoons and evenings at committee meetings arguing such issues as drainage, paving, and salaries; he began to write The Common Sense of Municipal Trading-, and he spoke at political rallies. The play presents no evidence that Jack similarly occupies him- self with practical politics. As Charles Berst accurately states, it blends</page><page sequence="18">50 BERNARD F. DUKORE "caricature, abstraction, and playwright . . . first on a level of self-parody and fun in Jack Tanner and second on a level of personal moral and spiritual analysis in Donjuán," who like Shaw extols "contemplation and work above thoughtlessness and play." Parody and serious commentary balance each other.30 Shaw describes Ann in terms of the Life Force: "Vitality is as common as humanity; but, like humanity, it sometimes rises to genius; and Ann is one of the vital geniuses" (11,549). Exemplifying mother-woman, she instinctively chooses a particular man "to enable her to carry on Nature's most urgent work" and claims him for a purpose beyond her personal purpose (11,507). With the Hell scene, she more clearly does so. Be- cause, she learns, the Superman is not yet created, she cries "to the uni- verse" for "a father for the Superman!" (11,689). Directly, the play re- turns to the Sierras, where the search party, led by Ann (the actress who plays Ana) finds Jack (the actor of Juan). The party's first words are Ann's, "It's Jack!" to which he responds, "Caught!" Shaw underscores the point: "The Life Force! I am lost" (11,692). During the final scene, as he capitulates to her, he explains, "I am in the grip of the Life Force." As for her: "I dont understand in the least" (11,726). Nor does she have to. It suffices that she embodies the Life Force. Their union is hopeful because the embodiment of the Life Force weds the explicator of it. Shaw calls Jack a Don Juan because he is "in mortal conflict with ex- isting institutions" (11,497). According to Bentley, the play about Jack is considerably less grand than the paragraphs in the preface. He calls him "an ineffectual chatterbox" involved in the story of "the snapping-up of a clever young man by a shrewd young woman" and "the traditional fool of comedy in highly sophisticated disguise."31 One might not so readily accept Jack as an ineffectual talker if the sensible Straker had not done so: "Never you mind him, Mr Robinson. He likes to talk. We know him, dont we?" (11,589). Numerous critics note that Jack understands the theory of the Life Force but is ignorant of his role in it and is wrong about the people he judges: Ann, Octavius, and Violet. Yet he may recognize that Octavius is not the artist he eulogizes, for he calls him a "maudlin idiot" about love (11,590), which the true artist is not. Although Ramsden may suggest what Jack will become, what of it? Because the Life Force strives for improvement, the advances of one generation, if it advances, are of course outmoded by those of the next. However, these views are not the entire picture. The worst Shaw says of Jack is that he has "impetuous credulity and enthusiasm" with "a touch of. . . modern plutocratic vulgarity" (11,632). Shaw also says that, unlike anyone else in the comedy, Jack aims "at the formulation of a philosophy of life"32 - which makes him a true counterpart of Juan. Why should we believe that Ann will tame him? Unlike the artist Jack hypothesizes, he</page><page sequence="19">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 5 1 will not have to drudge for a living to support his wife: he is rich. Only his limitations and the obstacles he faces will prevent him from fulfilling his aims. According to Shaw, his marriage will help him: "When Ann is married she will look after Tanner exactly as Candida looks after Morell. But when Candida was capturing Morell, and had not yet become his housekeeper and his nursery mistress, she was Ann."33 Jack's statement "I am neither the slave of love nor its dupe" (11,593) may be truer for him than his remark about woman-mother using man-husband. Al- though he says he will be Ann's slave, her mother disagrees: "No: she's afraid of you" (11,721). One should attend to her, since she knows Ann better than anyone else in the play. The very nature of Superman - preface, play, inner play, appendix - defies easy analysis. "I have only made my Don Juan a political pam- phleteer," says Shaw, "and given you his pamphlet in full by way of ap- pendix" (11,516). If one sees only the frame play, one misses an ample explanation not only of the Life Force but also of the title. As Arthur Nethercot observes, the word Superman appears in the Hell scene but not in the frame play.34 If one fails to read the pamphlet, much of Jack's socialism may be problematical. Superman consists of all. The Hell scene brings a different perspective to the comedy, from which it differs. In the comedy, love conquers. In the Hell scene, thought surmounts Hell, the home of romantic love. Without the Hell scene, the Don Juan figure may seem to subordinate his will to the woman's. By contrast, the Hell scene has him go to Heaven to do his own work for the Life Force - thereby providing an alternative fate for him. Without the Hell scene, bourgeois audiences of Ramsdens can feel superior to Jack, who may return respectably to the fold and be as Bentley says the traditional fool of comedy. With it, such audiences cannot feel so supe- rior and the Juan figure is not merely the conventional comic fool. With- out the Hell scene, Jack is a present soon to become a past, as Ramsden has; with it, he represents the future. While the Hell scene is the mutual dream of Tanner and Mendoza, it is - given the play's perspective - essentially that of Tanner, who dreams of himself as a success. Without the third act, he is disparaged; with it, he is made much of. In the frame play, the Juan figure's arguments are usually demolished; in the dream, they are not, for unlike Jack, Juan is not contradicted by facts of which he is ignorant (such as Violet's marriage). Whereas Jack, misunderstand- ing the others, talks but fails to face things as they are, Juan does. Jack drifts with Ann's will; Juan goes to heaven to steer. In brief, Juan is more advanced than Jack. Note, in addition, how Shaw's preface to Puritans points to Superman: "when I see that the nineteenth century has crowned the idolatry of Art with the deification of Love ... I feel that Art was safer in the hands of</page><page sequence="20">52 BERNARD F. DUKORE the most fanatical of Cromwell's major generals than it will be if ever it gets into mine. The pleasures of the senses I can sympathize with and share; but the substitution of sensuous ecstasy for intellectual activity and honesty is the very devil" (11,28). Without the Hell scene, the play may seem to deify love and sensuous ecstasy. With it, intellectual activity and honesty defeat "the very devil," who may be more of a tempter than any other in literature. Whereas others demand eternal damnation, Shaw's offers eternal, unthinking pleasure - for those who like that sort of thing, and as he says, they are legion. With the Hell scene, the devil recognizes "gloomily" that Juan's "going is a political defeat" (11,687) for the love and sensuous ecstasy he represents. Unlike Superman, John Bull dramatizes the defeat of intellectual activ- ity and honesty. For making Ireland suffer, Broadbent denounces Eng- lish politicians as more unscrupulous than Bobrikoff (a dictatorial Rus- sian general who subjected Finland to Russian rule) and Abdul the Damned (a bloodthirsty ruler of the Ottoman Empire who committed widespread atrocities in Armenia). But as Tanner's Handbook states, "What a man believes may be ascertained, not from his creed, but from the assumptions on which he habitually acts" (11,788). Broadbent's actions show that his assumptions differ from his rhetoric. Economically he will, like Bobrikoff, maintain English dominion of Ireland and by capitalistic methods will, like Abdul, commit damnable legal atrocities. Politically, economically, and romantically, his anglicized Irish partner assists him: he declines the seat in parliament, has shares in Broadbent's syndicate, and gives up the woman, who far from being an incarnation of vitality, like the women in Superman, is nutritionally feeble and has a will feebler than that of Broadbent, who is set on having her. Is Larry Doyle a viable alternative to Broadbent? He likes Broadbent, is his friend, and helps him. Compare Shaw: "I am persuaded that a modern nation that is satisfied with Broadbent is in a dream. Much as I like him, I object to be governed by him, or entangled in his political destiny" (11,811). Despite Larry's high-flown rhetoric, which he fer- vently believes as much as Broadbent does his own, the assumptions on which Larry habitually acts reveal his true partnership with Broadbent, both ironically "civil engineers" (11,893): they will engineer (contrive, plan, guide the development) civil matters (the relationship of citizens to each other and the state). Unlike Juan, he does not dissociate himself from the person who does or will soon rule the local establishment, and he fails to work for the Life Force.35 Nor is Keegan a viable alternative. Without him, Larry might have more stature than he does, but Keegan only talks, not acts. While every dream may be a prophecy, as he says, he does not act to fulfill it - unlike Juan, the philosophic man who both contemplates and acts (goes to</page><page sequence="21">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 53 heaven). In contrast to Juan who steers, Keegan drifts to the Round Tower to break his heart uselessly, as he admits. Perhaps for this reason Shaw makes him a defrocked priest, that is, powerless. As Shaw says in his preface to Barbara, wherein a religious person seizes power, "it be- comes the duty of the Churches to evoke all the powers of destruction against the existing order" as it is "capitalistically organized. . . . Nor can they merely endure the State passively, washing their hands of sin" (111,50-51). The passive Keegan does no better than endure and may do worse: vote for Broadbent. Jubilation marks Superman, where the vital geniuses Juan and Ann win; it holds hope for the future. John Bull dramatizes the defeat of the Life Force: one of the two men who might work for it serves Mammon, the other abnegates his social and spiritual responsibilities. Beatrice Webb's comments on Barbara apply more to John Bull: "the triumph of the un- moral purpose," "hell tossed on the stage - with no hope of heaven."36 In Barbara, moral not unmoral purpose triumphs in an arena that holds the hope of heaven. In Superman, Juan refers to "honor, duty, justice, and the rest of the seven deadly virtues" (11,636). Tanner's Handbook calls them "trumpery ideals" and names three more: right, religion, and decency (11,752). The fact-facing agent of the Life Force should reject them. "I wouldnt have your conscience, not for all your income," says Peter Shirley. Under- shaft, who faces facts, cannily inverts this platitude: "I wouldnt have your income, not for all your conscience" (111,111). According to Kee- gan, "every jest is an earnest in the womb of time" (11,1021). Conscience, perhaps the seventh deadly virtue, makes cowards of us all, as Hamlet says, for in terms of the Life Force it demands adherence to the others. Whereas Superman transvaluates conventional values in citing deadly virtues, Barbara does so in citing deadly sins: "Food, clothing, firing, rent, taxes, respectability, and children" (111,171-72). Money provides salvation from these sins, of which one, respectability, must be denied, ignored, or transcended, as it is by Jack and Juan in Superman, if one serves the Life Force. Perhaps in defiance of respectability, the Under- shaft tradition demands bastardy as a condition of succession. In Bar- bara, the three principal characters aid the Life Force. All have what Shaw says in the Epistle Dedicatory to Superman: "the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one . . . the being a force of Nature" rather than a "beauty monger" - rejected by Cusins as empty aestheticism - or a "sentimentalizer" - rejected by Bar- bara when she throws aside "feverish selfish little . . . ailments and griev- ances" and revitalizes herself (11,523). As Shaw writes in his preface to Barbara, Undershaft has a "constant sense that he is only the instrument of a Will or Life Force which uses</page><page sequence="22">54 BERNARD F. DUKORE him for purposes wider than his own" (111,31). In the play, he reveals it. Charged by Cusins that he has no power, he replies not that Cusins is right but "None of my own, certainly," which is different. The power that drives the armaments factory is "A will of which I am a part." In other words, he is an instrument of the Life Force, used for purposes he recognizes to be greater than his own. While Cusins dismisses the statement as metaphysics, claiming instead that he is enslaved by "the most rascally part of society," Undershaft's answer is neither assent nor dissent but "Not necessarily." It is the world's will he serves, to use Tan- ner's phrase, and if "the rascals," he says, adopting Cusins's term, are shrewder than the good people, he is not to blame. He challenges Cusins to leave off "preaching and shirking" in favor of "fighting the rascals," but he cannot compel Cusins or any good person to do so: "I can make cannons: I cannot make courage and conviction" (111,169). "This marvellous force of life of which you boast," the Devil tells Juan, "is a force of Death: Man measures his strength by his destructiveness" (11,653-54). Yet as Undershaft demonstrates, the force of death may serve that of life. The maxims summarize his arguments to convert Cu- sins and also reveal his relationship to the Life Force. Since man should not withhold the sword from the hand given by God, the use of weapons is part of a divine force. The right to fight belongs to all, the right to judge to none; therefore Undershaft provides weapons to all, without moral judgment; it is up to the good people to select this means of power and place an order. Man may have the weapon but the victory is heav- en's, or the Life Force's. Whoever holds power does not own it but is an instrument of it. The weapons are for man to use; their employment is part of the Life Force's continual struggle by trial and error. Although Undershaft is a conscious agent of the Life Force, he does not represent the ultimate in social or spiritual organization. To Shaw, no one person or principle does. A hint at Undershaft's deficiencies may be his statement that after his immediate predecessor's maxim nothing remained for him to say. To the contrary, much remains to be said - and done. Other hints abound. Money and gunpowder, says Undershaft, are necessary to salvation; no one says they are sufficient for it. When he tells his wife that Stephen does not interest him, she responds that he is their son. His comment, "I see nothing of myself in him, and less of you" (111,145), indicates myopia, for there is much of her in the boy. Furthermore, a socialist like Shaw, or even unlike him, would hardly consider a capitalist, however benevolent or farsighted, to represent the final word in social evolution. These comments on Undershaft's shortcomings should not diminish his importance in regard to the Life Force. Apart from what has been said, the steps he takes to find the right sort of successor are those that</page><page sequence="23">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 55 Juan says the philosophic man takes to help life fulfill itself. Clearly, Undershaft wants someone who will go further than he - or ones who will do so, since in Act III Cusins and Barbara alternate as Undershaft's antagonist, suggestive that they constitute a single entity. While they later define what they hope their separate roles will be, Shaw pits both in dialectical argument with Undershaft, thereby fusing the social-intellectual and the spiritual. They join in marriage as well. Does this forecast the subordination of one vitalises purpose to the other's? No, since the fulfillment of one de- mands the fulfillment of the other. Note one of Shaw's frequently over- looked statements: "When it comes to sex relations, the man of genius does not share the common man's danger of capture, nor the woman of genius the common woman's overwhelming specialization" (11,51 1). Cu- sins is that man of genius, Barbara that woman. Symbolic of the Life Force's union of religion and sex is the Salvation Army's conversion of Donizetti's wedding chorus to the West Ham Sal- vation March. But the wedding of Barbara and Cusins unites both with social advance. Juan's discussion of sex relations fits these characters: In the sex relation the universal creative energy, of which the parties are both the helpless agents, overrides and sweeps away all personal consid- erations, and dispenses with all personal relations. The pair may be utter strangers to one another, speaking different languages, differing in race and color, in age and disposition, with no bond between them but a pos- sibility of that fecundity for the sake of which the Life Force throws them into one another's arms at the exchange of a glance. (11,675) In stage directions and dialogue, Cusins's desire to marry Barbara, who offers no resistance, reflects this energy. "By the operation of some instinct which is not merciful enough to blind him with the illusions of love" says Shaw, "he is obstinately bent on marrying Barbara" (111,80). In the screen version, Shaw has him virtually paraphrase Juan when he declares to Barbara, within minutes of first seeing her: I have impulses that I cannot explain. They come very seldom. But when they come, nothing can stop me. There is an end of my conscience, of my prudence, of my reason. Such an impulse seized me the moment I saw you. You are poor; you are ignorant; our table manners are differ- ent; our relatives will not mix; everything is against our association with oneanother. No matter: to be with you I will join the Army: I will put on the uniform and beat the drum: in short, I am hopelessly and for ever in love with you and will follow you to the end of the world until you marry me. Were Barbara averse to his advances, she would reject them. Instead, "calm and greatly amused" she asks him to see her home and meet her</page><page sequence="24">56 BERNARD F. DUKORE family, adding only, "God has some little surprises for you, my friend."37 Cusins has an inkling that this union transcends the personal and links to godhead: "Dionysos and all the others are in herself. I adored what was divine in her, and was therefore a true worshipper" (111,164). Un- like Tanner, who is pursued rather than pursues, Cusins is also unlike him in that he realistically regards his future as unknown: "I dont like marriage: I feel intensely afraid of it; and I dont know what I shall do with Barbara or what she will do with me. But I feel that I and nobody else must marry her" (111,118). At the end of the play, when Barbara renews her vocation, she pointedly includes Cusins and marriage. She will have him still, she says, imploring her mother to help her select a house for her and Dolly (his nickname). With children or not, their home will be no dolly's house for her, only a place, as she says, for them to live in. Whatever biological work she may do there, she is not a specialist but has other work outside. "The law for father and son and mother and daughter is not the law of love," says Tanner: "it is the law of revolution, of emancipation, of final supersession of the old and worn-out by the young and capable" (11,599). His Handbook defines a revolutionist as "one who desires to dis- card the existing social order and try another" (11,737). Barbara drama- tizes both ideas. As Undershaft's adoptive son, Cusins, challenged to blow up existing society, will supersede him; Barbara, marrying Cusins, will become not only Mrs. Andrew Undershaft - which connects all three characters - but also Mrs. Andrew Undershaft VIII, which emphasizes her union with her father's revolutionary superseder. Tanner talks and writes pamphlets; Ann suggests that he enter Parlia- ment. Doyle talks but serves the plutocracy; Keegan preaches but does nothing. With Shaw, Cusins recognizes that pamphleteering and preach- ing are ultimately "no use" (111,39); with Undershaft, that Parliament is a "foolish gabble shop" (111,151), a surrogate for Undershaft's real power; with Barbara, that to refuse Undershaft's offer would mean his reading reviews and her playing the piano, i.e., uselessness. Undershaft chal- lenges him, "Turn your oughts into shalls, man. . . . Whoever can blow men up can blow society up" (111,175). His acceptance of the challenge is not capitulation. He takes Undershaft's accomplishments as founda- tions for greater and different work. What he accepts is power to act. To do otherwise would leave him an ineffectual intellectual. Seizing the op- portunity to turn should into shall, he becomes a Platonic philosopher- king - "Plato says . . . that society cannot be saved until either the Pro- fessors of Greek take to making gunpowder, or else the makers of gunpowder become Professors of Greek" (111,178) - to save society in the sense of redeeming it, not preserving it. Furthermore, he changes during the play, gradually becoming an agent</page><page sequence="25">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 57 of the Life Force. A prologue to the screenplay clarifies his interest in religion. He calls it "my life's work. ... I am interested in the essence of all religions. . . ."38 Shaw suggests his abilities in Act I, chiefly when he takes charge of the introductions to clarify identities for the long-absent father of the family. He becomes more prominent when he becomes Undershaft's confederate in Act II, but even here he does not under- stand the Life Force. At this stage, he believes, quoting Euripides' The Bacchae, "the spirit of God - whate'er it be - " is a "law that abides and changes not" (111,1 18). He later realizes that it does change, that a dead language and civilization cannot alter the world, but that power to blow up society and create anew can do so materially and spiritually. Regard- less of possible personal consequences (the loss of Barbara), he surren- ders to the Life Force. "I dare. I must. I will," he says (111,182), inaccu- rately. There is no "must" about it. Note the Devil's partly accurate words: "As to your Life Force, which you think irresistible, it is the most resis- tible thing in the world for a person of any character" (11,685-86). It is resistible, but not for a person of real character, like Cusins, who chooses to become its agent. His will accepts the dare and turns it to must. Like Juan's philosophic man, he contemplates, then acts upon his under- standing of what to do. What are the shalls to which he will try to change his oughts? To begin with, he repudiates the Armorer's faith, which is to sell arms to anyone who can pay for them, be that person aristocrat or republican, capitalist or socialist. "I shall sell cannons to whom I please and refuse them to whom I please." Undershaft replies, "From the moment when you be- come Andrew Undershaft, you will never do as you please again" (111,169). As Turco explains, this means "that the Professor will be in the grip of the Life Force, not that he will be under the thumbs of the very Pascals' Undershaft proceeds to urge him to fight."39 Also, Undershaft may back down, since he does not repeat the ultimatum that sparked Cusins's re- jection: unless he keep the Armorer's faith he will not enter the business. Minutes earlier, Cusins demonstrated his abilities by persuading Under- shaft that by a technicality he qualifies as a bastard and that the tradition the heir be uneducated is unimportant. To only one demand does he agree, a change of name, but "Would any man named Adolphus - any man called Dolly! - object to be called something else?" (111,166). Next, he defeats Undershaft in Undershaft's own province, business. Tena- ciously, this University don who does not know whether three-fifths is more or less than half persuades the capitalist to raise his salary and add a percentage of the profits. Undershaft perceives his mettle: "You are a shark of the first order, Euripides. So much the better for the firm!" (111,167). His renunciation of the Armorer's faith recalls his statement that like</page><page sequence="26">58 BERNARD F. DUKORE Barbara he loves the common people. Although Undershaft scorns such love, neither Cusins nor Barbara changes his mind. To the contrary, Cusins reiterates it and goes further. For him, all do not have the right to fight and he intends to judge who does have. By small but significant changes, shown here in brackets, Shaw's screenplay clarifies Cusins's principles:40 As a teacher of Greek I gave the intellectual man weapons against the common man [I gave the rich man an intellectual weapon against the poor man]. I now want to give the common man weapons [give the poor man material weapons] against the intellectual man. I love the common people. I want to arm them against the lawyers, the doctors, the priests, the literary men, the professors, the artists, and the politicians, who, once in authority, are more disastrous and tyrannical than all the fools, rascals, and imposters. I want a power simple enough for common men to use, yet strong enough to force the intellectual oligarchy to use its genius for the general good. (111,181) The last sentence is particularly important. Work for the good of the people differs from work for the profit of a few. Cusins, who will be among the intellectual oligarchy, will try to use his genius for that good. In a Fabian fashion, he aims to broaden the base of power, to build upon Undershaft's social advance, to turn the capitalist Perivale St Andrews - by extension and analogy, England - into a socialist democracy. Will he succeed? Realistically, Shaw does not prophesy. He depicts a dramatic present and a desire. At issue is whether social position shapes the individual or the individual the position. Shaw does not simplisti- cally choose: "What a man is depends on his character; but what he does . . . depends on his circumstances" (111,46). Will Cusins report for work at six the next morning, as Undershaft wants, or at eleven, as he wishes? Each is determined, but Shaw is ambiguous. Although the play's final line is Undershaft's command, "Six o'clock tomorrow morning, Euripi- des" (111,185), its final word, added in revision, is a reminder that the Professor of Greek will take over the factory - mitigating the possible impression of Undershaft Triumphant.41 "Every genuine religious person is a heretic and therefore a revolu- tionist," says Tanner's Handbook (11,737). Barbara learns that while, in Undershaft's words, "All religious organizations exist by selling them- selves to the rich" (111,121), they have no choice for, in Shaw's words, "The notion that you can earmark certain coins as tainted is an unprac- tical individualist superstition" (111,35). No matter that Undershaft's fac- tory manufactures instruments of death. "There is no wicked side," she says: "life is all one" (111,183). Also, "There are no scoundrels" (111,90). Names are irrelevant. What counts - as Bluntschli indicates in Arms and</page><page sequence="27">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 59 the Man when Nicola denies his engagement to Louka - are the conse- quences of one's actions, not moralistic labels. It is irrelevant to call Un- dershaft wicked or a scoundrel. His elimination of poverty counts. For Shaw, the Salvation Army's military form of organization is apt: "Does it not suggest that the Salvationists must actually fight the devil instead of merely praying at him? At present, it is true, they have not quite ascer- tained his correct address" (111,37). Barbara finds it. In changing her locus of operations, she becomes, like Cusins, an agent of the Life Force. According to Shaw, "there is no salvation . . . through personal righ- teousness, but only through the redemption of the whole nation from its vicious, lazy competitive anarchy" (111,36). Barbara and Cusins unite to accomplish both simultaneously. Like Cusins, she accepts the power Undershaft offers, like him she aims to use it for her own ends, and as with him the alternative is ineffectuality. He intends to create social re- demption from without, she individual redemption from within. The absence of poverty enables her to eliminate the bribe of bread, concen- trating her energies on hungry souls, not hungry bodies. Her job will not be easy. These workers are quarrelsome and uppish, like Bilton; some are atheists, like Shirley. Barbara more than loves the common people, she is one of them. Early in the play her mother complains that she discharged her maid and lives on a pound a week. Late in the play Barbara asserts, "I have no class, Dolly: I come straight out of the heart of the whole people." She adds that Undershaft's workers think he "ought to be greatly obliged to them for making so much money for him - and so he ought." What the workers are to her biological father, she - a worker for God - is to her heavenly father: "When I die, let him be in my debt, not I in his" (111,183-84), i.e., let him be obliged to her as Undershaft is to his work- ers. Although Undershaft and Cusins are foundlings, Shaw links them with capitalism and intellectualism. He links Barbara with the proletar- iat. Perhaps her union with Cusins to create simultaneous social and spiritual redemption suggests a union of proletarian and Fabian. Cusins's accession to power provides a new perspective on efficiency, which in John Bull characterizes scoundrels, of which Barbara says there are none. The month after Shaw completed Superman, he told Beatrice Webb, "efficiency is obviously not a final term and cannot be held up as an end."42 In Superman, he suggests it may be a socially useful means. Straker wants "to do away with labor. Youll get more out of me and a machine than you will out of twenty laborers" (11,589). Juan regards the Life Force's creation of a brain as an efficient way to determine "the line of greatest advantage" (11,685). John Bull condemns efficiency as a means to serve "the cupidity of base money hunters" (11,1018). At issue is not efficiency but the end it serves. With Broadbent, the end is social harm;</page><page sequence="28">60 BERNARD F. DUKORE with Undershaft, social beneficence. Although he operates efficiently - even manufacturing explosives in separate small sheds so that if one blows up little money and few lives are lost - he eliminates poverty and lays the groundwork for greater and more efficient improvement by Life Forcers who succeed him. As Charles Frankel perceives, Barbara does not offer a choice "between Efficient Power and Inefficient Vir- tue. . . . The problem of Power, in a word, becomes the problem of dis- tributing it, not of eliminating it." He effectively argues that Shaw de- mands recognition of the purpose for which power is used. Efficiency and inefficiency differ, but power and virtue need not, and in Barbara efficiency, like power, joins virtue. "Virtue without Power is empty," says Frankel; "but Power without Virtue, without ideas, is blind." Among this play's themes are that "Power is not something inherently immoral, and that . . . the false dilemma of Power versus Virtue merely keeps us from getting ahead with this job."43 But what of power used to kill? Like efficiency, killing is a means to- ward an end. Such a view may seem mad, and the question of madness, with the readiness to kill, recalls another great English play that Shaw's trilogy resonates - Hamlet, whose original rather than readymade mo- rality, says Shaw, sets it above Shakespeare's other plays.44 Shakespeare's sympathetic, serious treatment of a madman is "an advance towards the eastern consciousness of the fact that lunacy may be inspiration in dis- guise, since a man who has more brains than his fellows necessarily ap- pears as mad to them as one who has less" (111,17). This explanation characterizes the "madness" of the Life Force figures or visionaries in this trilogy. A twentieth-century Donjuán, says Shaw, "is now more Hamlet than Don Juan" in that he is "a true Promethean foe of the gods"; nat- urally, "the man whose consciousness does not correspond to that of the majority is [considered by them] a madman" (11,502,510). Shaw says Jack is "possibly a little mad" (11,541) and when he calls Ramsden "Polonais," Ramsden accuses him of considering himself Hamlet. Although Men- doza quotes Hamlet on Ophelia and Laertes, both he and Jack have the dream of Hell. The Life Force visionary is Keegan, called mad by others and himself. William Irvine's interpretation of Jack and Superman ap- plies more to Keegan and John Bull: "a modern Hamlet who goes on talking and philosophizing in the face of modern imperatives. ... As a Hamlet play, it condemns its most interesting character to relative inac- tion."45 In Barbara, Undershaft says that he, Cusins, and Barbara - all Life Force figures - are mad. Note the variations. Jack, who may be slightly mad and whose con- sciousness exceeds that of the others, writes about revolution. Although Keegan 's words may carry weight among the villagers, he seems delib- erately to avoid using his influence. Reprimanding Patsy Farrell for gen-</page><page sequence="29">Shaw's "big three" 61 uflecting to him, he calls himself "unfit and unworthy to take charge of the souls of people" (11,926). Nor, apparently, does he consider himself fit to take charge of their bodies. The visions of the ironically self-described madman transcend those of everyone else in the play, but he is unable or unwilling to act on his perceptions of the destructiveness of capital- ism. Not only does he give no indication he will work against Broadbent and the syndicate the Englishman represents, he confesses - with more weariness than irony - that it might be "better" for him to vote for an Englishman who knows what he is doing than an Irishman who does not (11,1015). With a young face but white hair, he may look - as photo- graphs of Granville Barker in the role look - older than his fifty years. His reference to himself as "an oldish man" (11,988) suggest a person who has given up. Not so Undershaft, Cusins, and Barbara. This trio, whose madness is explicitly characterized as superiority to the common mob, recognizes that the readiness to kill, a major theme in Hamlet, is "the final test of conviction, the only lever strong enough to overturn a social system, the only way of saying Must" (111,174). To Shaw, "Hamlet, who does not dream of apologizing for the first three murders he com- mits, is always apologizing because he has not yet committed a fourth" (IV,285). The reason is that though he was raised according to "the vin- dictive morality of Moses he has evolved into the Christian perception of the futility and wickedness of revenge and punishment," but he can- not comprehend this reason (V,688). In Barbara, one character's circum- stances of birth resemble Hamlet's: Cusins, who like Hamlet is his own cousin, though unlike the Dane his father, not his mother, married the spouse's sibling and he is the product of the second not first marriage. Cusins grapples with "the moral question" (111,168). When Undershaft argues that poverty has withstood sermons and articles and urges him to kill it, not preach at or reason with it, Cusins initially repudiates this sentiment but finally admits Undershaft is right. Unlike Hamlet's mur- der of Claudius, such killing is not retributive. Circumstances alter cases. With weapons forged by fire and resulting in blood - recalling the Sal- vation Army's motto, "Blood and Fire," which Undershaft says might be his own and which Cusins accepts when he joins the Army and then the firm - such killing, of a pestilence more rotten than anything in Shake- speare's Denmark, is justified. With Shaw's Hamlet and Shakespeare's, readiness is all by the play's end, when both are willing and able to kill the rank offender of the commonweal. In his preface to Puritans, written the year before Superman, Shaw anticipates Jack and Juan, Cusins and Barbara: "From Prometheus to the Wagnerian Siegfried, some enemy of the gods, unterrified cham- pion of those oppressed by them, has always towered among the heroes of the loftiest poetry." He identifies "the Superman" as the newest such</page><page sequence="30">62 BERNARD F. DUKORE hero and adds, "Two and a half centuries ago our greatest English dramatizer of life, John Bunyan, ended one of his stories with the re- mark that there is a way to hell even from the gates of heaven, and so led us to the equally true proposition that there is a way to heaven even from the gates of hell" (11,33-34). This statement obviously relates to Shaw's trilogy, which discusses paths from hell to heaven. In Superman, the "great gulF' between them is a parable, "the difference between the angelic and the diabolic temperament" (11,647). The frontier "is only the difference between two ways of looking at things. Any road will take you across it if you really want to get there" (11,687). Recognizing that "the brain will not fail when the will is in earnest" (11,672), Juan leaves for the frontier. In John Bull, Keegan does not feel at home in a world he calls hell. Heaven may be close: "Could you have told me this morn- ing where hell is?" he asks Larry. "Yet you now know that it is here." Heaven "may be no farther off" (11,1019). Yet without Juan's will, a being like him "can only look at Heaven from here: you cant reach it" (11,923). Barbara wishes she "could have the wings of a dove and fly away to heaven!" When she says, "I cant," she means that the journey is not that simple, for it requires both Juan's steadfast will and also work. She agrees with Cusins that "the way of life lies through the factory of death" - through, not in - and adds, "through the raising of hell to heaven and of man to God" (111,182-84). In the final scene, she becomes "transfigured," "has gone right up into the skies," and, dragging at her mother's skirt, becomes as a child again (111,184-85), a condition Matthew says is nec- essary for entry into heaven. But Shaw changes metaphors, or rather gives different meanings to "heaven" and "hell," and "earth" as well. In Juan's words, "hell is the home of the unreal and of the seekers for happiness." Containing "noth- ing but love and beauty," it is - and one may infer the heartfelt anguish of Shaw, a recently retired theatre critic - "like sitting for all eternity at the first act of a fashionable play, before the complications begin." In hell, "Nothing is real"; it is merely "a perpetual romance, a universal melodrama." Earth "is the home of the slaves of reality," where people "play at being heroes and heroines, saints and sinners," but are made aware of their false dreams and true slavery by hunger, thirst, cold, age, disease, and death. Heaven is "the home of the masters of reality," where "you live and work instead of playing and pretending. You face things as they are; you escape nothing but glamor; and your steadfastness and your peril are your glory" (11,637,650-51,682). In Juan's view, like that of most people, what Keegan calls hell is earth, and the horrors he viv- idly describes are earthly. He sees neither heaven, though he hopes it may be near, nor what Juan calls hell, whose romantic indolence is leagues away from Rosscullen's poverty.46</page><page sequence="31">SHAW'S "BIG THREE" 63 Using Juan's definitions, Barbara contains all three places. Wilton Crescent is the hell he describes; West Ham the earth, where people play at being saints and sinners. The masters of reality work at Peri vale St Andrews, where they abandon pretence and face facts amidst occasion- ally perilous explosions. In a passage discarded from the published text, Cusins explicitly says of its workers, "Compared to the West Ham pro- letariat theyre in heaven already."47 While Undershaft's Jactory and town might seem a comparative heaven, with Peter Shirley at the gates, it is really a potential heaven, where Cusins and Barbara may forge it. In the heaven of his dreams, says Keegan, "the State is the Church and the Church the people: three in one and one in three. It is a commonwealth in which work is play and play is life: three in one and one in three. It is a temple in which the priest is the worshipper and the worshipper the worshipped: three in one and one in three. It is a godhead in which all life is human and all humanity divine: three in one and one in three" (11,1021). Barbara makes his vision concrete. Where Undershaft has used his power to eliminate poverty, his daughter works toward salvation and her intellectual fiancé, his adoptive son, aims to give power to the people. In the world they hope to create, men and women will do God's work for its own sake and human life will become divine. The three are so interconnected as symbolically to become one. Undershaft sires Bar- bara, is succeeded by Cusins; he hands on his torch of reality and power to his daughter and to his adoptive son, who assumes his name. Through blood and spirit, he fathers Barbara, who marries Cusins, who Dionysos- like is reborn via the man he calls "Dionysos Undershaft" (111,135). Un- dershaft looks after people's bodies, Cusins their minds and social needs, Barbara their souls. Only together can they become effective; they form a trinity of body, mind, and soul necessary for economic and spiritual salvation.48 Shaw's vision is not simple. Thus, to say as Turco does that "Barbara's 'life is all one' resorts to cliché to muddle the meaning" and that "Cu- sins's 'all power is spiritual' is only a paraphrase of Carlyle's disastrous aphorism 'All force is moral'" may seriously muddle Shaw's meaning, which insists on the interconnectedness of the different elements of his united trinity. Nor is it accurate to state, "It was Shaw's misfortune to have sensed that his view of life was tragic at precisely the moment when he was temperamentally least capable of facing tragedy."49 Since all ma- jor characters get what they want, the play is comic, not tragic. Under- shaft gets the type of heir he seeks, Cusins the chance to try to forge the type of world he envisions, Barbara the devil's correct address. Lady Britomart keeps the foundry in the family and Stephen, relinquishing what he does not want, reconciles with his father, whom he comes to admire. Snobby Price gets the small amount of money he wants, Mrs.</page><page sequence="32">64 BERNARD F. DUKORE Baines the large amount the Army needs, the Bill Walker, who pays his debt as he wants to pay it, may find his soul saved, for as Undershaft asks, "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?" (111,156). The play is comic in another conventional sense. As Charles Frohman is reported to have said, "Shaw's very clever; he always lets the fellow get the girl in the end."50 Perhaps one of the most cogent state- ments on Shaw and the culminating play of this trilogy is by Kingsley Martin, who edited The New Statesman and Nation: "He preferred debate in which no one won, though everyone scored." Challenging anyone to find an alternative ending to Barbara, he observed that while "Almost any other dramatist would have been content" with a conventionally dramatic solution of the personal situation, "Shaw had become so ab- sorbed in the intensely difficult problem of power and its relation to ideas that he leaves his play and his players wrangling and his audience carrying on the discussion after the curtain falls."51 This trilogy connects in another basic sense. As Shaw says in the Epistle Dedicatory to Superman, "Money means nourishment and marriage means children; and that men should put nourishment first and women chil- dren first is, broadly speaking, the law of Nature and not the dictate of personal ambition." However, it is more than stupid to place "nourish- ment and children first, heaven and hell a somewhat remote second, and the health of society as an organic whole nowhere," since man's de- sire to be rich and woman's to be married inevitably produces, "without a highly scientific social organization," poverty, prostitution, infant mor- tality, and adult degeneracy. "In short, there is no future for men, how- ever brimming with crude vitality, who are neither intelligent nor polit- ically educated enough to be Socialists" (11,504-5). Superman deals not with nutrition but with sexual attraction, now left by men to women. John Bull dramatizes nutrition as handled by the stupid men to whom women now leave it, the result being the horrors just cited. Barbara dramatizes nourishment as practiced by sagacious people, at least one with socialist ideals, who provide true nutrients for the health, not stul- tification, of society. Setting a theoretical groundwork, Superman shows possibilities of suc- cess and failure for the Life Force in the frame play and an abstract success in the inner play. John Bull dramatizes a probable failure, Major Barbara a possible success. Act I of Barbara corresponds to the frame play of Superman, Act II to John Bull, and the final scene to the Hell scene of Superman. Beginning with possibilities of the Life Force's success and failure, it moves toward a depiction of failure and concludes with a hope of success - a fitting finale to and culmination of Shaw's "big three."</page><page sequence="33">Shaw's "big three" 65 Notes 1.

Is it coincidental that like Barbara, Heartbreak House resonates Shylock in The Merchant of Venice? His "there be land- rats and water-rats, land-thieves and water-thieves" is echoed by Shotover: "Land-thieves and water-thieves are the same flesh and blood. . . . Off with you both" (V,138). Subscribing to Proudhon's view, Shaw agrees. As Undershaft marches out of the Army shelter, he cries, "My ducats and my daughter!" (111,136), spoken by Shylock upon learning that his daugh- ter has left home and taken his money. By contrast, Undershaft's daughter leaves her home for his. Whereas Shylock loses money and daughter, Undershaft invests money to gain his daughter. Wittily, Cyrus Hoy - "Shaw's Tragicomic Irony," The Virginia Quarterly Review, 47 (Winter 1971), 69 - notes: "Captain Shotover, like Andrew Undershaft in Major Barbara, is a munitions maker, and Heartbreak House literally operates on the profits earned from</page><page sequence="34">66 BERNARD F.

I thank the anonymous reader of this essay for Shaw for calling my attention to Hoy's fine article, of which I was unaware when I completed the essay. 18.

In striking contrast to Berst's treatment of autobiographical elements in Man and Superman is that by Arnold Silver - Bernard Shaw: The Darker Side (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Pr., 1982) - who manages to be both farfetched and reductive (to conven- tional Freudian views). I restrict my comments to his chapter on this play. Arguing from what he admits are "Unascertainable causes" that shaped Shaw's marriage, he allows him- self "to speculate on" some "less conscious" aspects of the marriage's early months (but provides no proof that Shaw was less or at all conscious of them) and to "wonder" whether Shaw "unconsciously" (how does Silver know?) rejected sex "in order to avoid the crime of incest and its attendant punishment of castration" (p. 136). From unascertainability, spec- ulation, less consciousness, and unconsciousness, Silver's wonder leaps to such confident assertions as "Fearing in the depths of his being that he might be less than a man, he fantasizes himself as a Superman" (p. 172) but fails to cite a source wherein Shaw calls himself one. To Silver, Shaw's introductory description of Ann "clearly" indicates his "dam- aging ambivalence" toward her. What he regards as clarity is the statement that her mother does not agree with Octavius that she is enchantingly beautiful. What he calls ambivalence (different from complexity of character) is neither self-evidently true nor proved. In the same paragraph, however, he turns ambivalence to condemnation. "Unable to say un- equivocally whether she is physically attractive or not, Shaw then seeks to make the issue irrelevant by declaring that however she looked, 'Ann would still make men dream.' " Partly for this reason and partly since Shaw says that weaker women might call this vital genius a cat, he concludes, with convoluted reasoning, that her role is "designed to discredit her" (pp. 127-28). Because I have greatly abbreviated his example, I invite readers to examine the stage direction in toto to decide for themselves whether Silver's interpretations are jus- tified. 31.

Turco, p. 190, claims that Larry grows "more isolated from the rest" in the final scene. This view is sustained by neither dialogue nor stage directions, which have Keegan leave Larry and Broadbent together. Noting that Broadbent's statement that Larry has "no capacity for enjoyment" repeats the Devil's about Juan (11,96,1005), Wisenthal concludes, p. 96, that Larry "is in some ways not unlike Juan." It seems to me that the repetition ironically emphasizes an unrealized potential. 36. Beatrice Webb, Our Partnership, ed. Barbara Drake and Margaret I.

What I call a trinity of Undershaft, Cusins, and Barbara, Hoy with a different em- phasis, p. 72, suggests is a synthesis of Undershaft's and Barbara's goals "that satisfies the body's material needs and thereby frees the spirit to save itself. The play accomplishes this miracle of synthesis through that union of culture and power which is prefigured at the end when Cusins, who throughout the play has been affianced to the munitions maker's daughter, is designated heir to the Undershaft cannon works as well." In viewing the play this way, Hoy may follow the lead of Eric Bentley, Bernard Shaw, p. 167: "Probably the idea of making Cusins the synthesis of Barbara's idealism and her father's realism came to Shaw later, perhaps too late." Unlike Bentley, Hoy does not believe the idea came too late. Nor do I. 49. Turco, pp. 227-28. 50. Hesketh Pearson, George Bernard Shaw: His Life and Personality (New York: Athe- neum, 1963), p. 236.
