DANIEC MAN, FLORA AND FAUNA IN THE BRONZE DOOR OF THE GNIEZNO CATHEDRAL IN POLAND In remembrance of the 1000th anniversary of St. Adalbert's martyrdom In central Poland, about thirty miles northeast of the city of Poznari, lies Gniezno, one of the oldest Polish urban communities and the legendary cradle of the Polish nation. Dating back to an eighth century settlement, it was referred to as a civitas as early as the eleventh century.1 The Cathedral of Gniezno, a fourteenth century Gothic edifice erected over the foundations of two earlier churches built between the tenth and twelfth centuries, possesses an ornamental door, made of bronze, that is much older than the cathedral (Figure l).2 It is regarded as a twelfth century monument and an extant part of decoration of the earlier Romanesque basilica that was on the present cathedral's site.3 1.

In Poland, where Christianity was adopted in 966, the Cathedral of Gniezno has always been regarded as the first church in the hierarchy of Polish churches, occupying an important place in its national life. The Gniezno archbishops held the title of Primate of Poland and were empowered to rule the country during interregna. The cathedral functioned as a coronation church of the old monarchy. It was also the site of privilege for burials of distinguished individuals and of members of prominent Polish families.

The subject of the decoration is a continuous narrative recounting, in a series of relief carvings, the life and martyrdom of Saint Adalbert (Swiety Wojciech ), one of Poland's patron saints and a tenth century missionary who, like his predecessors Saints Patrick, Boniface, Columba (or Augustine), and Martin of Tours, distinguished himself in the evangelization of the European continent.4 [The Gniezno Door], edited by Michal Walicki, (Wroclaw: Ossolineum, 1956-19 59, three volumes), Vol. 2, pp. 7, 9.

The door was presumably cast on Polish soil by foreign, or foreign and native, craftsmen, itinerant artists of that era. See Walicki, Vol. 1, p. 229; and Morelowski, pp. 53, 55-56, 58-59, 72, 75, and 99. The epigraphical-paleographical analysis of the door's surface performed in 1955 revealed remnants of lettering (engraved with a hammered chisel) at the base of the door knocker of the left wing. Also, traces of signatures are distinguishable on the left molding of the left wing. The visible part of the lettering at the knocker's base is assumed to conceal the cipher of someone whose name was Petrus (or Piotr in Polish). The inscriptions along the left molding of the left wing show only two words in Latin that are legible, reading ME FECIT [I have been made by].

The door is rectangular in shape. It consists of two wings of somewhat different dimensions. The left wing is approximately 10 feet 9 inches high by 2 feet 9 inches wide, while the right wing's height measures about 10 feet 7 inches high and 2 feet 8 inches wide. The wings' thickness varies from 0.59 to 0.98 inches.

X-ray photography of the door points to a likelihood that the left wing might have been cast in one piece, or perhaps in a few large pieces; the right wing consists of twenty-four small parts which, in all probability, were soldered together after being cast separately. Each of the wings bears traces of damage ? in the form of cracks along the almost entire height, leading from its knockers upward and downward ? that was subsequently repaired. See Dziekonski and Wesolowski, pp. 125-126, 129, 135-139, 142-145, 147, 150-151, 155, 161, 182; Pietrusinska and others, p. 690; Zachwatowicz and others, p. 188. The surfaces of both wings show traces of round bronze pegs that penetrate the relief side to the reverse. Their heads are flattened and leveled off flush with the surface of the wing, and they had been used to fasten the bronze ornamental surface to its backing of wood. Seven singly spaced pegs were placed in various areas of the relief panels of the left wing; seventeen, arranged in pairs (except one) in the upper corners of each panel, held the panels of the right wing.

Beginning with the future saint's birth, the scenes show a gradual growing of the man, in both the physical and spiritual senses. Then, when the narrative process transfers to the right wing, the series of events is read from the top downward. These scenes are filled with a sense of increasing intensity, conflict and drama. There is a rhythm in the descent: The man's mission is undertaken and fulfilled, culminating in his death as a martyr; the final four panels show the disposition of his remains. The first image of the narrative, a scene in which a newborn is given his first bath, records the birth of Wojciech in Libice, Bohemia. Continuing in an upward direction, the second scene depicts his being presented by his parents at the church in Libice. In the next scene, he is entering the cathedral school in Magdeburg (it has been said that during his confirmation, Archbishop Adalbert of Magdeburg named the boy after himself, and it was under the name of Adalbert that Wojciech gained his fame in the Christian world). In the subsequent scene, Adalbert is depicted praying in solitude, filled with a desire to devote himself to the service of God. When Adalbert becomes Bishop of Prague in 983 (his investiture took place in Verona), he is shown receiving a bishopric from the hands of the German Emperor Otto II. The next scene shows him healing a devil-possessed man. The following panel depicts Adalbert having a dream in which the vision of Christ appears to him. Then he is seen pleading before a ruler on behalf of the people in bondage. Adalbert is next shown performing a miracle (involving a dropped but unshattered vessel) during his sojourn in the Benedictine monastery of St. Boniface and St. Alexis on the Aventine Hill in Rome. Adalbert stayed in that monastery and in the monastery of Monte Cassino for several years after he left Prague in protest against the behavior of his flock there. Later, he returned to Prague and eventually, after a visit in Hungary, went to the Baltic Sea territories, under the aegis of the Polish ruler Boleslaw Chrobry (Boleslaus the Brave), to convert the local pagan population to Christianity. This mission is represented on the right wing of the Gniezno door. At the tpp of the wing and continuing downward to the bottom, the narrative shows Adalbert's arrival among the pagan Prussians of Pomerania; okreslenia roli sceny w programie ikonograficznym zabytku" ['Displaying St. Wojciech's Remains' on the Gniezno Door.

The next two scenes present Adalbert at the start of his evangelical mission baptizing the Prussians and, later, preaching to them ? while the Prussians' stance betrays their opposition to him. The following panel depicts Adalbert celebrating the mass which was to be the last one said by him. In the succeeding scene, he is attacked and killed (this tragic event took place in 997). The next panel depicts the martyr's remains being displayed. Later, Boleslaw Chrobry is shown paying ransom for Adalbert's body. Following this act, Adalbert's remains are brought to rest in the abbey in Trzemeszno, in the vicinity of Gniezno, and finally to Gniezno itself. The last scene represents deposition of Adalbert's remains at the Cathedral of Gniezno. After his canonization in 999, the tomb of Adalbert became the site of the saint's cult and a place of pilgrimages.7 The door's central pictorial narrative is framed by a wide, richly ornamented border on each of the wings. Rendered in bronze bas-relief, it is filled with a rinceau (foliage) pattern, a spiraling vinelike stem adorned with motifs whose forms are evocations of the world of nature and are devoid of religious content.8 Entwined within the botanical background of the rinceau are naturalistic representations of fauna mingling with fantastic species of the animal, reptilian and bird worlds, and human figures occupying themselves 7. One of the most famous such pilgrimages was made in 1000 by the German Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, an ardent promoter of the development of the cult of St. Adalbert in Europe. Under Otto's patronage, Gniezno, previously subordinated to the Diocese of Magdeburg, was to become an independent ecclesiastical province in Poland.

A narrow molding embellished with straight lines, convex and concave, placed parallel to the door's edges, frames the border on the top, bottom and outer (hinged) sides.

Such ornamental motifs were common and widespread at that time: They were executed in bronze or precious metals; ivory carvings; works of enamel and embroidery; stained glass; wall paintings; sculptured stone of church portals, lintels, jambs, and capitals; and woodwork decorating the undersides of seats in church stalls. They also appeared as part of the initials and ornamental borders on the pages of illuminated manuscripts. The gradual emergence of the elaborately decorated Romanesque initial in book illumination became a discernible trend in the latter part of the eleventh century (after occasional appearances in the tenth century) and eventually reached its peak during the first half of the twelfth century. Its dominant decorative motif consisted of spirals of foliage within which were enmeshed forms representing animals, beasts, birds, and dragons. Later artistic invention incorporated human figures into this ornamentation, often in combat with the animal world.10 In the European continent's medieval culture, the skills of reading, writing and interpreting text were seen as awe-inspiring, meaningful faculties. The letter itself, regarded as the symbol of teaching and the source of knowledge, was conceived of as representing a living form. In the hands of the medieval artist, the letter virtually comes to life, transformed by its embellishments ? fashioned out of the living forms of nature: human, animal, bird and plant ? into a living form. But the text of a medieval story, similar to a text of our own time, could be recounted not only by verbal means but also through pictorial representation, 9. Dziekonski and Wesotowski, p. 125. 10. C. M. Kauffmann, Romanesque Manuscripts 1066-1190 (Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1975), pp. 19, 26-28, describes the development of a foliage from "fleshy" (derived from Anglo-Saxon decoration) to a thinner type, with spirals more regularly and tightly wound, that occurred about 1170, introduced from France.

Like an ornamental letter, an image became a symbol of teaching that was transformed into a living form by its decoration with human, animal, bird, and plant forms. The Romanesque artists' dislike for bare, unadorned space {horror vacui ), combined with their search for designs of decorative richness and diversity, led them to invent new motifs and combinations that were "literally inexhaustible.''11 * * * * * The eighty-five convoluting scrolls of a vine-rinceau adorning the border of the Gniezno door are a setting for a vegetal world which at first glance appears to evoke the forms of nature but does not represent true botanical genera. Although they are based on nature and imbued with an inner organic vitality characteristic of natural flora, most of the forms are invented, abstractions of motifs found in nature, influenced by imagination. One may say, using the expression of the French medieval art historian Denise Jalabert, that in the Gniezno rinceau's plant life "la flore est vivante avant d'etre vraie [the flora is alive before being real], a characteristic of foliate forms popularly represented in artistic compositions between the years 1140 and 1170.12 It was once observed that the presence of plant-like ornament on works of art might be compared to the role that natural flora play in true life, by bringing into reality the elements of "beauty, joyfulness and charm.'' For what would life be, what would the earth be without the flowers and foliage? What would artistic works be without floral sculptural ornamentation?13 The plant world of the Gniezno rinceau is frequently depicted in entanglement with the animal world. This allows the transformation of anatomical extremities, such as tails or tongues, into vegetative elements and permits the vegetal elements to cut across the animal forms. "It is as if the barriers between the animal and vegetable kingdoms had been cast down, and plants could turn into animals, animals into plants, at random."14 The animals of the Gniezno rinceau belonging to the natural world include lions and monkeys, a stag, a goat, a squirrel, a hare, a dog, a wolf, a rooster, a raven, long-legged water birds, and several small birds which, although unidentified as to species, are nonetheless portrayed as true forms of nature. Zoomorphic forms of the fantastic kind are hybrids born of both imagination and the world of nature. Their improbable shapes, embodying characteristics or real-life birds, beasts and reptiles, sometimes incorporate the qualities of man. There are multiple representations of a winged biped, part 11.

Was the selection of marginal decorative details an "accident, incident or intention?"15 And, assuming that there was a meaningful bond between the two elements, how might the viewers of the work of art interpret this existence of a mutual reference? To what extent does the marginal decorative element participate in the telling of the central religious theme imagery of the work? To what extent does the ornament based on nature fulfill the role of "mediator" between works of art and their viewers or users?16 To suggest a solution to these questions, a pictorial language of Romanesque decorative themes uniting plants, monsters, animals, and human figures remains undeciphered, for "there is some uncertainty about how to look at it, how to see it, and, therefore, how to interpret it."17 To Romanesque-era contemporaries such as Theophilus, a twelfth century monk-artist and the author of De Diversis Artibus, the branches, flowers and leaves, as well as little animals, birds, vermicular patterns, and nude forms were an enrichment of sacred texts for the greater glory of God, even if such "enrichment'' was devoid of a deeper meaning.18 Another person of the same era, St. Bernard (1090-1153), a great Cistercian abbot of Clairvaux, monastic ascetic and reformer, regarded excessive decoration in monastic churches as "unbridled, often irrational fantasy," opposed to monastic spirituality, satisfying only the spectators' "idle 15.

A contemporary of St. Bernard, Suger (1081-1151), the abbot of St. Denis, Regent of France and patron of arts, ardently promoted art as the material means, in his view, to aid spirituality in the faithful. But it was precisely that function which St. Bernard felt was useless in arts of decoration, distracting the faithful from worship.20 19.

Similarly, Ernst Gombrich comments on "ridiculous monsters" as "elusive dream-imagery" and a "waste and frivolity.'*1 In Poland, two prominent art historians, Lech Kalinowski and Zdzislaw Kepinski, proposed that the placement of ornamentation ? that is, of the vegetal and animal forms used as the adornment of a religious image ? was replete with symbolic significance. They argued that the creators of the border in the Gniezno door perceived an "allegoric sense" and a "moralizing symbolism" in their choice of certain figural human, animal and plant motifs with which they embellished the border, and also in the judicious manner in which they placed and juxtaposed these marginal ornamental motifs against the door's principal religious images.22 The Polish scholars said that even though not all of the border's ornamental motifs suggestively manifest the symbolism of a theologically moralistic context, the artists' aim was to use the border's imagery, surrounding the dramatic narration of the life of St. Adalbert, as an accompanying commentary in a metaphorical sense. One perceives the attempt to unify the ornamental world of the border with the central religious imagery of the door. That analogy and reciprocal tie between the two elements of the door's total surface decoration appear to have been based on a subtle understanding of a psychological situation hidden in historical episodes of the saint's life and in the symbolic essence of the selected ornamental elements of the framing border" Thus, according to Kalinowski and Kepinski, the door's overall decorative schema helped to express in the language of poetic parable the ideas of On the Aesthetic Attitude . . . pp. 7-8. 14.

It communicated to the onlookers the notion of moral dualism of evil versus the endangered good, and the basic conceptions of God and satan, sanctity and sin, heaven and hell.24 Polish art historian Stanislaw Mossakowski remarked that through a keen, joyous observation of a natural world of man, animal and plant, the medieval mind was shown a way to gain a deeper cognition of the Creator.25 That process "served as a reminder of humanity's oneness with God and his creations,'' observed an American scholar, J. L. Schrader.26 Both Schrader and the French medievalist Louis Reau suggested (on the basis of the views explored and shaped in the writings of some philosopher-theologians of the Middle Ages)27 that medieval society ? in its quest for both simple metaphors and elaborate allegorical interpretations "in terms of a pattern for life and salvation through Christ''28 ? had sought an explanation of truths 24.

Certain elements of medieval animal symbolism had roots in the Bible, mainly in the Psalms; others reached back to prehistoric times, passed on by oral tradition, as well as the writings of Greek and Roman historians and philosophers (Herodotus, Aristotle, Plutarch, or Pliny the Elder). Most medieval observations and descriptions of animals are found in the so-called Latin bestiaries, works of natural history, written and illustrated in the monasteries. Their purpose was both interpretative, summarizing a contemporary knowledge of the world of animals and their habits and traits, and didactic, imbued with their moralizing significance through description of human traits in animal behavior. These pseudo-scientific treatises included zoological accuracy and fables, myths and fabulous creatures, based on the Greek work by an anonymous author known as Physiologus and also on the Elder Pliny's Historia Naturalis, a Roman encyclopedia of the physical world of the first century AD. 28.

The phenomena of the visible world had been perceived as fraught with some deeper, concealed sense, cloaking and simultaneously revealing symbolically a world that remained physically invisible.29 It was the world of God's will, of the universal law of nature and of the process leading the human mind upward from material things to the immaterial to the transcendental reason of "harmony and light" which is God.30 The point of view that made the visible and invisible worlds inseparate and connected, that linked human nature with divine design, contributed to envisaging an association between elements in the world of nature and symbolism invested with theological interpretation.31 Medieval beliefs about animals, regarded with curiosity, admiration, awe, and fear, especially excited the imagination, creating the "animal myth." Their "habits and peculiarities" became rich in sacred symbolism.32 The animal worlds of real life and of the realm of human fantasy had been studied not for themselves alone, but as a reflection of man, the center of the Creation. The animal world had come to be regarded as a "mirror of human morals," reflecting the passions, virtues and vices of the human race.33 Consequently, a medieval artist tended to create animal-form designs not only purely for decorative purposes, he also pictured them as symbolic figures, and so he assigned human traits to animals and animal traits to people, investing these traits with moralizing conceptions and teachings often tinged humanity within the frame of its history nor the world of nature had any meaning in themselves but were meaningful only insofar as they led the way toward Christ (in quantum ducuntad Christum). Everything was regarded as emanating from God and gravitating toward Him. In this context, the animal world, both natural and under the guise of imaginary forms, was interpreted as Christologically symbolic. 29. R6au, pp. 61, 63, 78.

It has been observed that in medieval thinking no difference separated a naturalist from a moralist,34 even though "knowledge" of the natural world, being compiled from ancient texts and contemporary (medieval) descriptions and factual observations, often mixed facts with myth and produced fictitious, imaginary notions.35 Polish scholars Aleksander Gieysztor and Mossakowski see the "allure of an intellectual adventure," a diversion stimulating the observer's eye, his mind as well as the heart, in the process of interpretation of symbolic meanings, of symbolized ideas.36 A "symbol," as defined by Arnold Hauser, a sociologist of art, is a "form of indirect representation that does not call a thing by its name [and] avoids straightforward description in order either to disguise or to reveal it in a more striking way, or even, perhaps, to disguise and reveal it at the same time."37 According to him, "there is, no doubt, in every kind of artistic symbolism an element of mystery and mystification," of "ambiguity and variety of possible interpretations. "38 The complex ways in which meanings were not always perfectly or not immediately clear, yet attempted to convey notions of "allegoric sense" and "moralizing symbolism," are illustrated by the following examples of zoomorphic form ornamentation, in which anthropomorphism, or characteristics and emotions of humans, were projected onto animals. Nonreligious in theme, they became moralizing in intention, exploring a symbolic interaction between humans and animals.

Or, it could have been translated into a symbolic invocation: "Deliver me from the lion's mouth" (Psalm 22:22). A rooster was the emblem of Christ triumphant, or vigilance, and the call to penance; a peacock represented pride and arrogance; a crane was thought to keep a watchful guard.41 The dog's nature was believed to be sagacious, for by rejecting error the dog finds truth; the dog was also the symbol of fidelity, but it could also symbolize uncleanliness. A squirrel represented the symbol of covetousness; the centaur, one of the incarnations of the devil, it was said, also personified a warning against evil, having the simultaneous power of deterring from it; it was a lustful animal seldom seen by men ? its body was formed like that of a horse, but from the belly upward it was shaped like a man.42 The wolf, to which the "devil bears the similitude," "snatches and scatters the sheep" (John 10:11-13); it is the symbol of greed and of force and demonism.43 A fantastic creature with the head of a man and a lion's body hissed like a serpent and was described as hankering after human flesh "most ravenously.'*44 It was closely related to the basilisk, another imaginary monster. This one, a hybrid part avian, part reptilian and serpentine, was thought to have been able to destroy a man if it only looked or breathed at him.45 The motif of a stag, the embodiment of good, called to mind the expression from David's Psalm 42:2: "As the hart panteth after the fountains of waters, 40.

To the serpent, generally associated with the demonic aspects temptation and sin, was also attributed, in some contexts, the virtue of prudence.47 A siren, or harpy, part bird, part serpent with a man's head, meant impurity; it was able to entice people and to put them to sleep; it also symbolized souls of the dead.48 The asp, a serpent combined with a canine head, was a symbol of evil and sin; it dangerously injected poison with its bite: "Adders' poison is under their lips" (Psalm 140:4). The reptilian world was generally regarded as symbolic of the antithesis of good. A dragon, a winged creature part dog and part reptile, was, along with the monkey, compared to the devil; a raven dealt with the "troubles of men through omens," it disclosed the paths of treachery and predicted the future; a goat "can see so very acutely" that it was also a symbol of impurity, lubricity.49 The Biblical text "Thou shalt walk upon the lion and asp and the basilisk, and Thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the dragon" (Psalm 91:13) could be easily transposed by an artist into an ornamental design of a zoomorphic triad composed of a naturalistic lion, a fantastic biped and an asp, as seen, for example, in the bas-relief in the Gniezno door border, in the right lower corner of the right wing (Figure 2). This illustrates how, in a dialogue between the artist-creator of the work and the viewer-recipient of that work, a created visual image had the power to carry a symbolic as well as literal sense of the word.50 Nonetheless, the American art historian and educator Meyer Schapiro, without denying the possibility of the existence in medieval church art of imagery "designed as symbol or as illustration of a sacred text," challenged the principle that Romanesque religious art was always symbolic or illustrated a religious theme.51 He maintained that within the framework of church art there 46.

This new art, on the margins of the religious work, was accompanied by a conscious taste of the spectators for the beauty of workmanship, materials, and artistic devices, apart from the religious meanings."52 The medieval art scholar Jurgis Baltrusaitis observed that the Romanesque artist's choice of ornamental motifs, composed of the association of plants, animals, monsters, and humans, as well as the method of their application, juxtaposition and play with one another, was not the result of an accidental, spontaneous artistic improvisation, or fantasy. Based on observations of precise mathematical factors, "sort de calcul mathematique, d'une geometrie savamment etablie" [out of mathematical calculation, of a wisely established geometry], it was the result of a complex, strictly organized, structured system.53 Henri Focillon's view of medieval art was that it was an "intellectual art" in which the "laws which govern the distribution and composition of its forms are themselves the products of sublime thought."54 Had the decorative system within the border of the Gniezno door been organized according to any laws of mathematical principles? And, was it possible that application of mathematical formulas had been used to reinforce the bond, the tension, between the ornamental context of the door's border and the door's central imagery, portraying the dramatic life of St. Adalbert?

There are frequent entanglements or a mutually constraining crossing, or lassoing, of animal forms by vegetative elements that transform and distort their prey's anatomical extremities into plants. Within the fantastic, abstract zoomorpho-botanical forms of the right wing rinceau dwell four human figures, depicted as if they were suspecting a lurking danger; they either carry weapons or are confronted by animal forms. Among the imaginary animal forms are numerous depictions of serpent-like, reptilian monsters (thirteen, in comparison to four in the border of the left wing of the door). Their presence appears to inject into the right wing border</page><page sequence="21">The Bronze Door of the Gniezno Cathedral 23 an accelerated rhythmical order, pervading it with elements of strangeness, restlessness, and a latent menacing force combined with the sense of an underlying vigilance. The serpentine monster, although shown in a variety of renditions, is endowed with a coiling body, canine head with a voraciously open snout, two heavy, clawed feet, and the wings of a bird. The image of that fearsome hybrid has been regarded as the classic element of a decorative vocabulary of animal form motifs of Romanesque-era art.55 It is said that this bizarre creature, when forming a component of the ornamental schema of an artistic work, had the power to focus the gaze and attention of the viewer by conveying to him at once a sense of horror and fascination, awe, fear, and veneration.56 Its seminal source is sought in the "serpent in the Garden of Eden . . . [which] gave humankind knowledge of good and evil and with it the burden of original sin."57 In contrast to the right wing's rinceau decoration, the left wing's rinceau projects the aesthetic mood of a rather serene, peaceable kind, remaining in accord with the atmosphere of the adjacent central religious narrative of the wing, representing a normal and tranquil phase of Adalbert's earlier saintly life. The left rinceau is inhabited mainly by a botanical and animal world whose forms either replicate those found in nature or appear to have been patterned on real life. Notwithstanding their stylized decorativeness, fewer of them depict fantastic flora or fauna, and all show a lesser degree of mutual entanglements and metamorphoses. The five human figures seen within the left wing rinceau are pursuing the everyday occupations of vineyard harvest, or hunt. Such a sympathetic choice of marginal ornamental motifs, derived from the varied and exuberant world of plants, animals, monsters, and humans but applied in accordance with the mathematical principle of numbers, arrangement and associated relationships, lends itself to the notion that the choice was neither an accident nor an incident but rather was intentional and meant to achieve a structured and regulated composition for the marginal ornamentation framing the principal visual field with its religious content. Earlier in this article a question was posed regarding the possibility of the existence of a mutual reference between the central religious theme imagery in 55.

On the basis of the analysis of the ornamental rinceau border in the Gniezno Cathedral's door presented here, the border appears to have been calculated to intimately relate, to unite, the world of the ornamental border with the central religious theme imagery of the door in a meaningful thematic relationship and harmony.5* In that relationship, the marginal frame was not a "passive element." Although an ancillary element to the principal pictorial narrative, it played an enhancing, supportive role to it. Attracting and capturing the imagination and the viewers' gaze, the border's ornamental attractiveness, its vivid expression of life and the sense of "exploitation of the unexpected" helped to create and maintain the intensified visual interest between the beholder and the work of art.59 It is also felt that the artist's choice of the ornamental motifs in the border was aimed at helping the viewer to gain a deeper perception of the meaning of the door's central imagery, of its religious, abstract message, by sensualizing the latter, as it were, for the beholder's gaze. And, by participating in a symbolic presentation of the battle between good and evil, the marginal ornamentation of the rinceau border projected its engagement in a message carrying a moral point of view as well.60 It may be concluded that the border of the Gniezno door has been playing the role of an articulator of the message contained in the door's main pictorial narrative. The marginal ornament in the door's decorative schema appears to play the role of an "ultimate mediator" which, fraught with a "sensory pleasure,"61 is ? if one may use the expression of Oleg Grabar ? an "unenunciated but almost necessary manner of compelling a relationship between objects or works of art and viewers or users."62 Further exploration of the pictorial language, and its sources, of 58.

One may perceive such an ornament to have been the fruit of artistic spontaneity63 in a sensitive observer of forms, color and movement in the world of living nature,64 within the contemporary medieval culture that was marked by a pronounced increase of interest in natural sciences and the universe.65 (It was once remarked that the "grandeur'' of a "vision of man and of his relationship with the universe is revealed to us in medieval art."66 ) The Romanesque ornamental motifs discussed here might also have been conceptualized as hidden bearers of moralizing symbolism.67 They were compatible with the twelfth century state of mind disposed to searching for symbolic meanings in the animal world, both natural and imaginary,68 an inclination nourished by the medieval culture rooted in the elements of folklore and popular belief, in the survivals of myth, fable, travel accounts, astrological illustrations, and encyclopedic bestiaries.69 They also sprang from artistic expressions that migrated from various interpenetrating cultures of the ancient East, Hellenistic and Roman antiquity, and Islam.70 Such motifs might also have had their source in man's direct experience of his environment. For the twelfth century artists and craftsmen, the hermit monks and their lay brothers working for monastic and church patrons, that environment had been mainly a rural wilderness in an overwhelmingly 63.

It manifested itself not only in natural beauties, in the pleasing interaction of association with animals and birds, but also in hostile powers of the world of nature and in unpredictable and menacing appearances of the animal inhabitants. In such an environment, the eremitic minds, accustomed to an isolated, self-contained, rigorously ascetic life, conceived of the artistic ideas that were inspired by the notions of God, the universe, human population, animals and plants ? real and fantastic ? merging in harmony in an interdependent web of life.71 One may also hypothesize that the motif of a convoluting vine stem inhabited by themes borrowed from the natural world might have captured the imagination of a medieval artist and of the beholders of his work as the physical embodiment of a vision of the spiritual landscape, proclaimed in Christ's words: "I am the vine, you are the branches'' (John 15:5). Or it might have reminded the artist and the beholders of his work of a Biblical reference that God Himself placed man in the "vineyard," a Garden of Paradise, "to be mindful of it, and tend it" (Genesis 4:8,15). One may also take into consideration the thoughts of Edward O. Wilson, a Harvard University biologist, that human beings are bound to other living things of the world by their natural affinity for life, which he described as "biophilia" and considered central to the evolution of the human mind. He defined the "biophilic instinct" as the "innate tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes," to explore and "affiliate with other forms of life."72 Guided by this inner direction, people examine with curiosity and wonderment the natural world of animals and plants around them, often tingeing that world with magic, symbols and fantasies, often drawing moral lessons from nature by translating the agents of nature into the symbols of their culture.73 The elements of a growing new realistic attitude toward the surrounding world of nature, a curiosity and wish to gain knowledge of it, were especially characteristic in Europe during the second half of the twelfth century,74 the time within which art historians are now crediting the execution of the bronze door of the Cathedral of Gniezno.75 Medieval notions celebrating nature are related, in a sense, to the twentieth century deep awareness of our natural environment and major ecologically 71.

Thus they are not oriented toward deciphering potential theoretical meanings of such emblems of medieval thought. They are nonetheless close to the Romanesque artists who searched for their inspiration in nature. The roots of that closeness rest in a shared "biophilic instinct," in humankind's "feeling for nature" and tendency for an intimate interaction with the natural world. The fact that these common sensibilities exist may eventually prove to be of aid to our speculations concerning the inherent meaning of popular medieval ornament composed of motifs whose forms are evocations of the world of nature. 76.
