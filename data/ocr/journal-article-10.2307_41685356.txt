A Silver Bracelet from Yugoslavia By BORISLAV JOVANOVIC In historic in the the fall immediate and of Roman 1972 a necropolis periods of was of discovered the proto- historic and Roman periods was discovered in the immediate vicinity of Vršac-At, a town in eastern Vojvodina located on the border be- tween Romania and Yugoslavia. The necropolis, which lies above a settlement of the Late Neo- lithic period and below a sand quarry, has be- come the subject of a silent battle between ar- chaeologists and construction agencies concerned with the town's growing need for building mate- rials. Fortunately, owing to the efforts of R. Rašajski, the director of the National Museum in Vršac, one of the graves dating to the La Tène period (fifth to first century b.c.) and belonging to the Celtic tribe of the Scordisci has been com- pletely excavated, yielding objects of great inter- est. The importance of the discovery is twofold. First, it has extended our meager information about the art of the Scordisci which had until now come from a few stamped and engraved swords, anthropomorphic belt buckles, and painted and burnished pottery. Secondly, it adds to our understanding of the ethnical structure, history and geography of the Scordisci - the strongest tribe in the Danube Basin and central Balkans during the last two centuries b.c. To judge by the jewelry in the grave, the burial at Vršac-At must have belonged to a woman. According to contemporary custom, she was cre- mated, and her remains were taken from the funeral pyre, put in an urn and buried. The flames which consumed the body of this lady damaged some of her jewelry. Her burial urn is a wide-mouthed conical vessel of characteristic shape and workmanship. Decor- ative molded bands link the vertically set cylin- drical handles by means of arcs in the form of garlands. The urn is handmade - as opposed to the wheel-made wares which the Celts had brought into the Danube Basin. The dating and cultural identification of the urn pose no special problem. Both the technique of manufacture and the ornamental features point clearly to the ceramic ware of the Dacians, the eastern neighbors of the Scordisci, whose kingdom was the most powerful enemy of the Roman Empire until the time of Trajan. We can further state that the urn dates from the second or first century b.c. when such pottery was in demand among the Dacians in Transylvania and the eastern part of the Car- pathian Basin. Three pairs of fibulae or decorative brooches found in the grave also play an important role in establishing the date of the burial. The form of these fibulae often depended on the current fashion, so that changes in their design provide us with a precious chronological indicator. Two of the three pairs are of bronze, and the remain- ing pair contains one bronze and one iron brooche. The bronze fibulae were made with great care, especially the pair with parallel ribs and hemi- spherical ornaments which were probably inspired by fibulae decorated with coral or amber beads. The second pair also has ball-like ornaments to which molded ribs were joined. Both of the fibu- lae which make up the third pair are simple in 38</page><page sequence="2">The bronze fibulae with relief decorations from the cremation burial from Vršac-At. The middle illustration is a detail of the one above it. The cremation urn from the burial at Vrsac-At. form, but the arc of the iron one was emphasized by a small oval reinforcement. These fibulae re- semble jewelry deriving from the late Middle La Tène period, and comparison with similar ob- jects from the necropoli of Middle Europe, the Danube Basin and Transylvania allow us to refine our determination of the date for the grave to the end of the second century or the very be- ginning of the first century b.c. Like the fibulae, the two necklaces from the grave form a pair, although they differ in both design and mode of manufacture. They may have been decorative chains although this point can- not be confirmed because both necklaces were damaged in the fire, especially the smaller one made of bronze. A group of small bronze beads, which belong to the same kind of jewelry, was also partly destroyed by the fire. Finally, a pair of bracelets undoubtedly make up the most valuable find. Although the bronze bracelet was damaged by the crematory fire, we can reconstruct it as consisting of a few turns of metal with circular incisions. The ends splay out into fan-shaped terminals decorated on the outside with impressed rosettes. This kind of jewelry appears in the territory of the Scordisci at the beginning or in the first half of the first century b.c. in a rather more developed form, so the example from Vršac-At should be considered somewhat older. As with the urn, here too a link can be seen with Dacian hoards of silver jewelry from the last two centuries b.c. They contained similar bracelets with a few windings and widened ends decorated with stamped palmettes. 39</page><page sequence="3">The silver bracelet from the cremation burial from Vrsac-At. One end of the silver bracelet in the form of a seal with zoomorphic masks. Ahe second bracelet, hammered out of silver sheeting, is by all standards an exceptional find, not only for its artistic value but also as chrono- logical evidence. Although partly destroyed by the flames of the funeral pyre, all the necessary elements are preserved. An open bracelet with seal-shaped terminals, it is given unusual interest by the fantastic animal heads set one over the other above the terminals. Their sculptural effect, attained by breaking the rounded eye-arcs, was intensified by a series of circular depressions and short incisions. Owing to the scarcity of similar artifacts, the origin, stylistic features and significance of the en- graved zoomorphic forms remain an enigma. In design, the open bracelet with seal-shaped ends is a common type among the Celts in central and southeastern Europe, but the Celtic counterparts are usually earlier in date than the At grave. Their resemblance may derive from a common origin during the Middle and Late LaTène periods in the Carpathian Basin, but it does not account for the animal heads on the bracelet from At. If we look farther to the east, in the neighbor- ing Dacian territories, we find contemporary bracelets with ends in the form of snake heads. These are often modeled in a realistic manner reflecting traditions as old as the Early Iron Age in the territories of the Balkan Danube Basin. A bronze bracelet of this type^ was found in the fortified Celtic settlement of Zidovar in the vicin- ity of Vržac-At, but it bears no stylistic or typo- logical resemblance to the bracelet from At, in spite of the fact that both of them belong to the 40 same cultural setting and period. The torques and bracelets from the Celtic world of western and central Europe with their stylized human and animal heads present a strik- ing contrast to the modeled zoomorphic images of the silver bracelet from At. The majority of such Celtic jewelry is considerably older than the At bracelet, belonging chiefly to the latter half of the fourth century b.c. or to the first half of the third century b.c. If we wish to discover other models which in- fluenced barbarian Europe in the last centuries of the pre-Christian era, then similar fantastic images from the contemporary toreutics of the Mediterranean should be taken into account. They usually appear as molded ornaments on metal vessels, frequently imported into the contin- ental hinterland of the Hellenistic world. But, here again, such imports are as a rule consider- ably earlier. It would seem, therefore, that the bracelet, although it owes its general typological scheme to the La Tène world of central and western Europe, derives its special character from a local eastern Celtic style. Here we should remember the famous cauldron of hammered sil- ver found in Gundestrup, Denmark, whose rich human and animal decoration seems to show strong eastern European influence. Similarly Dacian and Thracian art may have influenced that of the Scordisci, especially since the Dacians greatly favored silverwork and simple shapes. But neither seal-shaped terminals nor fantastic animal heads are found in Dacian work.</page><page sequence="4">jA. s we already have noted, the paucity of re- mains unearthed to date prevents us from estab- lishing an independent art among the Scordisci. Most finds, including a hoard of silver jewelry from Kovin in Yugoslavia, could reasonably be attributed to Dacian or central and western Euro- pean Celtic traditions or to native Early Iron Age survivals. This points out the complicated, heterogeneous nature of the culture of the Scor- disci, who were themselves a mixture of La Tène populations. With this background in mind, the varied composition of the burial objects from Vršac-At becomes more understandable: the urn of Dacian type, the typically Celtic fibulae, the locally made bronze bracelet with Dacian influ- ence. Indeed, the silver bracelet with its imagin- ary zoomorphic composition may be our first evi- dence for the existence of an indigenous Scor- discian art. We should not, however, forget that all these objects belonged to one and the same person and were placed in her grave after her cremation. Cremation is a funerary rite which the Celts adopted only after their arrival in the Carpathian Basin. Explained as the influence of the aborig- inal inhabitants of the Early Iron Age, which also included various ethnical and cultural ele- ments, this mode of burial speaks for long and intimate contact between the different popula- tions living in the Carpathian Basin during the La Tène period. If these complex social processes led to the formation of new populations, as in the case with the Scordisci, or to new modes of burial, as seen in cremation, or to new variants of the material culture, then art could hardly have remained unaffected. The dating and cultural identification of the burial objects from At remain obscure without a consideration of the history of the Scordisci, well known to classical writers as the most bellicose tribe in the Balkan-Danube Basin territories. Two ancient historians, the Greek Strabo and the Roman Titus Livius, both writing at the end of the first century b.c., assert that the Scordisci lived together with the Illyrians and Thracians but were considered to be of Celtic origin. The data supplied by archaeology support this picture of the ethnic makeup of the Scordisci, although we cannot yet describe the exact processes of assim- ilation which characterized the La Tène period in central and eastern Europe. The intense and frequent wars between the Scordisci and the Romans, which usually took the form of Scordisci incursions into the Roman province of Macedonia, were conducted with varying degrees of success, but ended in the de- feat of the Scordisci. A very interesting detail mentioned by the Roman writer Frontinus (second century after Christ) indicates that at the end of the second century b.c. the Dacians fought as allies with the Scordisci. The cremation burial site at Vrsac-At with its Daco-Celtic arti- facts gives us palpable evidence of this alliance. The history of the Scordisci can be summarized in three phases. The first occurred at the end of the fourth century and the beginning of the third century b.c. when the Celts expanded into the Balkan Danube Basin and the complicated proc- ess of assimilation began. After the Greeks de- feated the Celts at Delphi in 279 b.c., the Scor- disci arose in the Yugoslavian areas of the Dan- ube and Morava Basins with a uniform La Tène culture. The second phase was during the latter half of the third century and the second century b.c. At this time the Scordisci attained their greatest territorial extent and made the greatest number of raids against the Romans; the At grave came at the end of this floruit . Dur- ing the final phases, from the first century b.c. to the beginning of the first century after Christ, the Scordisci came under increased Roman pres- sure from the south and west while, in the east, the Dacians grew stronger. During the Pannonian Wars of the first century after Christ, the Scor- disci lost their independence, although they maintained a diminished tribal community with- in the Roman Empire until the second century of our era. As with every new find, the silver bracelet from At raises more questions than it answers. The great value of the tomb group lies not only in the chronological data it provides but also in the evidence it gives of the harmonious relation- ship between peoples of different ethnical and cultural backgrounds. This association led to the formation of a new and strong population in the Balkan-Danube Basin territories, a united people known as the Scordisci.
