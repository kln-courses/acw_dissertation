<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. Bruce Long DAKSA: DIVINE EMBODIMENT OF CREATIVE SKILL Among the numerous deities or divine principles in the Vedas credited with promoting the creation or evolution of the universe, none has been the object of a wider range of scholarly interpreta- tions than Daksa. The lack of consensus among Indic scholars about the precise nature of this deity is due in part to the fact that his character is represented in the Vedas in rather vague and shadowy outlines, with few explicit statements about his person- ality and role in Vedic religion. One of the few facts about his nature that is clearly stated in the Vedic literature is that he serves as one of the foremost cosmogonic deities. Like many another cosmogonic deity, not only in Indian religion but in other traditions as well, Daksa is marked by fewer distinctive features than are other gods who assume more limited functions and occupy humbler positions in the pantheon. For example, little is said about his birth, beyond the fact that he sprang from Aditi, the feminine personification of "the Boundless." We also know nothing of his physical appearance or the nature of his relationships with other gods. Furthermore, unlike most of the other Vedic deities whose fame rests upon the performance of particular creative or heroic acts, Daksa is not credited with the performance of any memorable deeds, beyond his "performance" of the primal creative act. Even to employ an active verb in depicting his involvement in the cosmogony is, perhaps, to exaggerate the degree of dynamism in his nature. Because of his quiescent and almost abstract character, 29</page><page sequence="2">Daksa Daksa resembles the amorphous and passive Indo-European god of the sky vault, Dyaus. Indeed, Daksa may have been a Vedic surrogate for this ancient celestial deity, who appears in the Rgveda to be little more than a fading cultural memory in the minds of the Aryan poets. The lack of specificity and dynamism in the personality of Daksa might be explained, in part, by reference to the limitations imposed upon him by virtue of his position as creator god in the Vedic pantheon. The character of a majority of creator deities in the history of religions is lacking in both these qualities. Because of their extreme transcendence of the creaturely realm and their primordial nature, the character of creators is rarely represented by a significant number of highly specified features. Studies of the Creator or High God within the various religions of the world' have demonstrated that such deities possess few anthropomorphic traits and are credited with little more than the act of fashioning the universe and, in certain cases, the establishment of the system of social relations and legal principles upon which human society is based. During the past hundred years, there have appeared a number of brief studies of the nature and role of Daksa in the Vedas. The literature on this deity has ranged from general surveys of Vedic religion,2 handbooks on Indian mythology and ritualism,3 and sourcebooks on Vedic literature,4 to philological and textual studies of key terms and concepts in the Vedas,5 and extensive 1 From among the impressive wealth of scholarly writings on the subject of the High God that have appeared in recent years, we will provide only a sample listing here: W.

It is the purpose of this paper to pursue an extensive (if not exhaustive) survey of the conceptions of Daksa which inform and shape the relevant Vedic hymns and prose materials in which his name appears and to examine the various significations freighted by the term daksa- when it is employed in designating a quality of mind or state of being with regard to both divine and human beings.7 In order to illuminate both the specific facets of his character and his role and position in the Vedic pantheon generally, we shall be compelled to focus our attention, not only on state- ments about Daksa as an individual deity, but also on statements about his relationships with a variety of other divinities. One of the working assumptions of this study is the conviction that the nature of any particular deity can be apprehended accurately and comprehensively only when his character is viewed as part of a matrix of divine relationships which is represented by some extra- ordinarily potent symbol or complex of symbols. I. DAKSA AND ADITI: PRIMORDIAL CONSORTS AND DIVINE PROGENITORS The term daksa- appears in six passages in the Rgveda as a personi- fication of "'the Clever or Dexterous One,' i.e., as 'Cleverness' or 'Dexterity,' a deity associated with Aditi, with whom he consti- tutes a pair of universal parents, although he is said to have sprung from her as well."8 This personal or quasi-personal conception of Daksa and of his cogenerative partner, Aditi, is represented most 6 A.

In the segment that is to follow, primary attention will be focused upon the interpretation of the triangular relationship between Daksa, his daughter Sati (or Parvati), and his son-in-law Siva, as this familial situation is represented in the many extant versions of the myth of "Siva's Disruption of Daksa's Sacrifice" (daksa-makha- mathana). 8 Gonda, Some Observations, p. 5. 31</page><page sequence="4">Daksa succinctly in Rg-veda 10,72,4-5,9 which reads as follows: "The Earth [bhir] was born from Uttdnapdd; from the Earth sprang the directions [dsd].

In Bhdg.

Roth interprets the term Uttdnapdd as an epithet for Aditi: "Bhu (the world) was born, and from her opened womb (Uttdnapdd) sprang the Spaces: from Aditi was born Daksa (spiritual force), and from Daksa again Aditi. Yes, Aditi was born, 0 Daksa, she who is thy daughter; after her the gods were produced, the blessed possessors of immortality." He declares that "Daksa, spiritual force, is the male power, which generates the gods in eternity. As Bhi (the world or Being) and Space are the principles of the Finite, so to both of these is due the beginning of divine life."16 The key to understanding the cosmogonic view that informs the entire hymn is contained in verse 4. According to this verse, Daksa and Aditi are the primordial couple, the procreator and procreatrix of the universe, and the parents of the gods. The text does not inform us of the means of their origin. Perhaps they generated each other out of their respective divine natures or, perhaps, they were both projected out of an unspecified precosmogonic reservoir of divine power, the essence of which they share in common.17 We are told, however, that having come into existence, the primal pair united (or reunited, as the case may be) and through that union gave birth to the gods. The statement in verse 4b, to the effect that Daksa and Aditi generated each other, is obviously a paradoxical concept. From the standpoint of the canons of reason, the idea that two indepen- dent beings could give birth to one another strikes us as utterly nonsensical and leaves us puzzled as to what the poet possibly could have meant by such a statement. Such a statement thrusts several questions upon us: Given the self-contradictory relation- ship between the two terms of the statement, how can we make sense of it, i.e., how can we interpret it within a personally meaningful frame of reference? What was the purpose of the poet in resorting to this irrational mode of expression. Was there something in the nature of his vision of the cosmogony that com- pelled him to phrase the statement in this fashion? What was he attempting to indicate about the nature of the universe? To begin with the most general response, we would contend that, while the precise nature of the initial visionary experience of the poet is lost to us, it is apparent that he was striving to give utter- ance to a reality which he had perceived to transcend the limits 16 R. Roth, Introduction to the Nirukta and the Literature Related to It, trans. D. Mackichan (Bombay, 1919), p. 151. 17 Compare 10,5,1-7; 10,11,1. 33</page><page sequence="6">Daksa of thought and speech. Given the inexpressible nature of this divine reality, the poet no doubt found it necessary to resort to a paradoxical mode of expression in an attempt to transmit, at least, the "expressible" dimension of that insight to those persons who did not and could not share the experience directly. But why the adoption of the paradoxical form of expression, and why this particular formulation of the paradox? Paradox is a form of expression that is peculiar to religious discourse.18 This is not to imply that paradoxical statements are limited to religious dis- course altogether. It is simply to say that the paradoxical mode of expression lends itself naturally to the articulation of certain general ideas and insights which defy rational formulation. That is to say, those entities, concepts, and values that are normally separated into different cognitive categories (i.e., high-low, first- last, pure-impure, wise-foolish) in the course of commonplace conversation and within the context of philosophical discussion, are frequently identified with each other, interchanged, and even synthesized in religious discourse. Statements of this nature abound in sacred literatures. To take but a few of the more familiar examples: "The Tao that can be named, is not the true Tao," "The Brahman is the greatest of the great and the smallest of the small"; "That [The Brahman or Universal Self] art Thou [indivi- dual self]"; "The first shall be last and the last shall be first"; and "He who would be master of all, first must become servant to all." Each of these statements obviously transgresses the "law of non- contradiction" upon which all rational thought and discourse are established.19 In such statements as these, two concepts of opposite semantic value are juxtaposed and the relationship between the two terms, which normally obtains within the realm of ordinary discourse, is inverted. Or, to phrase the same idea in a slightly different manner, the paradoxical nature of a particular situation is articulated by positing a given semantic value in the initial element of the statement and then investing the second 18 The notion that paradox belongs properly to the realm of religious and theological discourse has been the guiding principle of a great many scholarly writings in recent times.

While such statements may scramble our normal pattern of reasoning and render our customary view of the world askew, this situation should not be taken as grounds for puzzlement or con- fusion. Indeed, it is the intention of such statements to project an image of the world that is different and, quite often, diametrically opposed to the view which we derive from normal "common- sense" perspectives, with a view toward convincing the listener that this view is more authentic and truthful than those revealed by the perceptions of surface appearances. Hence, the intention of such statements can be interpreted correctly only if the integrity of the paradox itself is preserved, and this objective can be accom- plished only by resisting the temptation to rationalize the terms in the statement into a single, unequivocal meaning. The statement in the Rg-Veda about the relationship between Daksa and Aditi makes a twofold declaration; Daksa is both the son and the father of Aditi; Aditi is the mother as well as the daughter of Daksa. Taken as a pair, they are homologized with the ancient Indo-European deities, Dyaus (Father-Sky) and Prthvi (Mother-Earth), as the primordial parents of the universe.20 They are depicted in the Vedas as existing in a relationship of reciprocal procreation, a state that is obviously a physiological impossibility under normal creaturely conditions. Each deity is both progenitor and offspring of the other. Normal and natural kinship relations are juxtaposed and then reversed. All of the links in the chain of causation, viewed under natural conditions, have been dissolved and intermeshed. There is yet another, third, or middle facet of the relationship between Daksa and Aditi that must be introduced for considera- tion. In addition to being both parent and progeny to each other, Daksa and Aditi are also husband and wife (or, at least, male and female consorts) who engage in sexual union for the sole purpose of procreating the gods and, perhaps by extension, the universe as a whole. This assertion raises certain questions concerning the origin and nature of this cosmogonic couple, namely, are they in fact the primal pair, behind or before which no creative agent or principle of any sort could be found to have existed, or are they themselves offspring of a "more primordial" (standard semantics fail us once again) being or force? If the latter, then they must be 20 See M. Eliade, "Prolegomenon to Religious Dualism: Dyads and Polarities," in The Quest: History and Meaning in Religion (Chicago, 1969), pp. 127 ff. 35</page><page sequence="8">Daksa viewed as the dual offspring of that preexisting cosmic unity. The texts do not state the matter specifically either way. We are forced to resort to our own resources in making reasoned con- jectures, based upon a critical reading of the text. Insofar as the two deities are viewed as the progeny of a primal divine entity and aspects of that one nature, their union must be interpreted as the "reunion" of the original masculine and feminine principles of creativity. Understood from the standpoint of the One, their sexual union is necessarily narcissistic, involving deities who are members of the same "family." Conversely, when that same re- lationship is interpreted as a sexual union between two distinct divinities, then their relationship must be viewed as unavoidably incestuous. For, while they may be seen as distinct and indepen- dent deities, their status as the primal couple also necessitates that they be understood as offspring of one and the same parental source.21 Viewed from either direction, Daksa and Aditi are the first couple, the parents of the gods and of the universe, and, taken as a single bipolar entity, they are the divine representation of the "two-in-the-one" and the "one-within-the-two," the unity-within- the-multiplicity and the multiplicity-within-the-unity. This para- doxical relationship can be stated in declarative form, but it cannot be rationalized, that is, reduced to a rational formula. The one subdivides its own nature, and in doing so it becomes pheno- menally two, while remaining essentially one. The members of the duad coexist in a state of bipolar differentiation. Each member has its own identity and function, but they are merely aspects of perfect divine unity.22 The one becomes "two" for purposes of creation; hence, the number "two" is the numerical equivalent of 21 This particular dilemma concerning the relationship between the primordial divine pair or the first human couple has commanded the interest of anthropolo- gists, cultural historians, and historians of religions for years. Among the more substantial contributions to the discussion, consult E. R. Leach, "Genesis as Myth," Discovery (May 1962), repr. in Myth and Cosmos, ed. J. Middleton (New York, 1967), pp. 1-13, "Levi-Strauss in the Garden of Eden," Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences 23, no. 4 (1961): 386-96; M. Eliade, "Mephisto- pheles and the Androgyne or the Mystery of the Whole," in Mephistopheles and the Androgyne (New York, 1965), pp. 78 ff. (the title of the British ed. of this work is The Two and the One). 22 See Visnu Pur. (1,15) where Daksa, on discovering that his "will-born" progeny fail to reproduce themselves, decides to provide a basis for their multi- plication by instituting sexual intercourse and accomplishes this task by uniting himself with Asikni, the daughter of the Prajapati Virana. The same version of Daksa's lineage is also recorded at MBh. 1,59,10 ff.; Brahma Pur. 3; Hariv. 1,101 (crit. ed., app. 1, no. 41). Also, in the Puskaramdhatmya in the Padma Pur., Daksa is said to have converted half of his person into a female consort by whom he begets numerous daughters; compare RV 10,129,5 and Br. Ar. Up. 1,4,3. 36</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions the created order.23 "Two" is the number of phenomenal existence, "one," the number of latent potentiality. Although the world of phenomenal entities (i.e., divine and semidivine beings, humans, animals, plants, etc.) manifests itself as a diverse array of duads or counterpoised polarities, given its original emergence from and its persistence upon an ontological unity, it must be viewed quint- essentially as an unbroken, nondifferentiated divine essence. Hence, "one" is the numerical expression of the state of virtuality, of precosmogonic latency, a condition conceived in mythological idiom as darkness, chaos, or formless waters. "Two" is the number of cosmogonic projection, of existence within the context of temporality, of ceaseless conflict between opposed forces, and of the creative turmoil that generates, sustains, directs, and, in the end, dissolves the universe. Neither the primordial state of onto- logical unity nor that of existential duality is anything without the effective presence of the other. To achieve a proper understanding of the nature of these two "states of being," it is necessary to view them as two sides of the same cosmogonic reality. When this same principle is applied to the relationship between Daksa and Aditi, it becomes evident that their sexual union is to be understood as the functional (though not ontologically real) restoration of the original, precosmogonic unity. Except for the fact that the primordial one becomes two and then reunites the dual aspects of its essential divine nature, the universe could not have emerged from the basal chaotic "stuff" of which it is consti- tuted. In light of the foregoing discussion, it should be obvious that Daksa and Aditi, in combination, function as both the efficient and substantive cause of the evolution of the universe. The poet appears to depart from the intention of verse 4 in verse 5, however, by tracing the descent of the gods directly from Aditi.24 The text says: "Then Aditi was born as your daughter, 0 Daksa. After her, the gods were born, the benevolent partakers of immortality.25 23 Consult S. Kramrisch, "Two: Its Significance in the Rgveda," in Indologica Studies in Honor of W. N. Brown (New Haven, Conn., 1962), pp. 107-36. See also her article, "The Triple Structure of Creation in the Rgveda," History of Religions 2 (1962): 140-75, and 3 (1963): 156-85. 24 See 8,75,1, where Daksa is "the father of the gods who satisfies all desires expressed in hymns of praise," and Taitt. Samhh. 1,2,3,1, where daiksa is represented as that which bestows glory and bears sacrifice to the gods. 25 Daksa will come into close association with "immortality" (amrta) in post- Vedic literature, with the latter taking the form of Soma or the moon, to whom Daksa betroths twenty-seven daughters to form the twenty-seven lunar asterisms (naksatras). 37</page><page sequence="10">Daksa This verse contains two ideas that demand closer consideration. First, taking the initial pada of the verse literally, we are led to believe that the poet has either suspended or ignored the impli- cations of the paradoxical statement in the previous verse. Here, he declares unequivocally that Aditi sprang from Daksa and that subsequent to her birth the gods came into being. There is not the slightest hint of the concept of mutual procreation between the mother and father of the gods. Second, while we are meant to assume that the gods sprang from the union between the primal pair, the text does not say so directly. According to the text in verse 5, Aditi was born as Daksa's daughter, and "after her" the gods were born. Why has the paradox in verse 4 been abandoned in verse 5? Is it possible that the poet's mind was disturbed by the implications of the paradox in verse 4 and that he sought a way out of the dilemma by falling back upon a more realistic and ration- al idea of the divine lineage? As the situation presents itself, the poet found it impossible to maintain his grasp on the paradoxical conception of the relationship between Daksa and Aditi beyond the original formulation of the idea and, as a result, found it necessary to resort to the terminology of normal kinship patterns. Whatever his reasons, both the incestuous and the narcissistic implications of verse 4 are ultimately abandoned in favor of the idea of a linear descent of the gods. II. THE QUEST FOR THE PRECOSMOGONIC ABSOLUTE The cosmogonic models which we have been scrutinizing thus far are rendered even more complicated by statements in verses 2-3 and 5-6 introducing still other philosophical motifs and explicitly indicating that there is something upon which even the universal parents depend for their birth.26 The poet appears to be responding to a faint but insistent summons to discover something, at an earlier stage of the cosmogony, whose nature is more fully "uni- versalized" (i.e., devoid of all anthropomorphic features and independent existence) than the primal pair. In a word, he seems determined to pursue the quest for a crystal-clear vision of the eternal absolute until he reaches the point where he can divine the condition which preceded and made possible the birth of the 26 There is a strong and pervasive tendency in Indian religion from the Vedas onward to conceive of the primal, precosmogonic state as forming a nondiffer- entiated unity. 38</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions world parents and that of the gods.27 A representation of the entire cosmogony in outline appears in figure 1. non-Being (dsat) Being (sdt) Uttanapdd The Earth (bhur) The Directions (aiSi) Aditi Daksa The Gods (devas) FIG. 1.-The outline of the cosmogony in RV 10,72,2-6 The poet declares in verse 2 that, on the one hand, "Brahmanas- pati has forged this [world] like a smith," and, on the other, that "during the earliest era of the gods, Being [sat] arose out of Non- being [dsat]."28 It is evident from this verse that the poet is drawing upon a variety of cosmogonic models. According to the first model, the universe was fired, hammered, and welded out of formless bits of metal by a cosmic smith. In this instance, the primal material was melted into a workable consistency and then molded and hammered into the appropriate shapes. According to the second model, the world emerged from the self-motivated stirring of the seeds of Being from the state of slumber upon the waters of chaos or Nonbeing. In ?.g-Veda 10,129,1-3, the original state is con- ceived to be chaos, "nothing but formless waters" in which "there was neither csat nor sat."29 This state of complete nondifferentia- tion gives way to the emergence of asat, and this state in turn yields to the initial separation of dsat and sat and the subsequent polarization of the two primal forces in a state of conflict for a position of dominance.30 Verse 3 reiterates the statement in the previous verse exactly, except for the single qualification that the advent of the realm of sat occurred "during the first era of the 27 See Macdonell on the origin of the gods, VM, p. 14. 28 According to H. W. Wallis (The Cosmology of the Rig-Veda [London, 1887], pp. 41 ff.) this hymn contains three moments: first, the birth of the three worlds; next, parallel to this event, the birth of the gods from their first parents; lastly, the rise and setting of the sun, represented by the figure of Mdrtdnda. 29 Compare TB 2,2,9,1 ff. 30 See F.

The intention of this passage is elaborated in Chdn. Up. (6,2) where it is said that sat emerges from asat to form a cosmic egg which floats upon the waters for a period of one year before splitting into golden and silver halves to form the two primary segments of the universe. Here the cosmic egg is the male element, or the semen, that is incubated within the watery womb of the female principle before springing to life in the form of the cosmos. The seed and the waters (i.e., the golden and silvery halves) are imagistic homologies for the various pairs of cosmogonic agents (e.g., Purusa and Viraj, Daksa and Aditi, Brahma and Sataruipa). It should also be noted in this connection that the claim that sat emerged from asat at the beginning is unconditionally denied by the sage Udddlaka in Chdn. Up. (6,2,1b-2) by means of a rhetorical question, "How could Being be produced from Non- being? " In answer to his own question, he replies, "On the contrary, my dear, in the beginning [all] this was Being only, One alone, without a second." While this is one of the initial appearances of this issue concerning the primordiality of dsat and sat, the debate no doubt reaches back into the Vedic period. And for that matter, the question continued to spark controversy between Hindus of varying philosophical persuasions and between Hindus and Buddhists throughout the centuries.31 The poet continues to develop this same theory in verses 3-4a with the declaration that the earth (bhar) and the directions (dsa) were born from Uttanapad32 ("she whose feet are pointed upward [in the act of parturition]") and from the earth, the directions.33 31 For a brief discussion of the issue of the relationship between sat and asat in the Upanisads, see M. Miller, trans., The Upanisads, Sacred Books of the East, no. 1 (Oxford, 1879), pp. xxxii ff. 32 In this hymn, the Uttdnapdd (Geldner: "der Kauernden"; Griffith: "the Productive Power") may not represent an independent creative agent, separate and distinct from Aditi, but rather Aditi herself in the posture appropriate for the delivery of the gods and the world. So says Geldner: "Diese ist die Utt&amp;napad, ein Beiwort der Aditi order einer anderen ursch6pferischen Potenz." Aditi may be a representative of the World Cow, with the gods as her "new-born calves." In the Visnu Pur. (1,7,13-14), the Vayu Pur. (10,15), and the Matsya Pur. (4,35), Uttanapad is identified as the offspring of ManuSvayambhuva by his wife Satarfpa. According to Sdyanca's commentary on verse 3, Uttanapad is the creative powers residing in the vegetative realm or "the whole creation of upward-germinating plants"; compare Manu 1,32, where no mention is made of ~ataripa or Uttanapad but only of Brahma's act of dividing his own body into two parts, male and female, and in the female begetting Viraj ("the Radiant") who, in turn, begat Manu Svayambhuva; see also Br. Ar. Up. 1,4,3. 33 A statement from Macdonell (VM, p. 12) may serve to clarify the poet's intention in tracing the lineage of the earth back to the directions or spaces (asa): "The space in which a thing is contained or produced is its father or mother." He cites the example of the quiver that is conceived to be the father of the arrows contained in it (6,75,5). 40</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions The text is ambiguous at this point, leaving in question whether the earth and the regions sprang up from Uttdnapdd simultaneously or whether each of them sprang from the other. Here, as elsewhere in the Vedas, the poets seem to feel at perfect ease with a set of multiple truths. At this stage of the cosmogony, it seems as though a world in the making has emerged from the primal darkness, but that world in its emergent state is as yet barren,34 still only a mere something that has arisen from nothingness. When we encounter the structural or thematic hiatus between the two padas of verse 4, we are reminded of a principle which appears to have served as a modus operandi among the ancient Vedic poets, namely, the belief that a number of divergent cosmo- gonic theories can be interwoven within a single hymn without transgressing any authoritative canon of truth: (1) Brahmanaspati (i.e., Brhaspati) forges the world like a smith; (2) Being evolves out of Nonbeing and thence, Uttdnapdd, the earth, and regions or directions; (3) Daksa and Aditi engage in mutual procreation, and she, in turn, creates the gods: and (4) the gods dance in the realm of chaos, and thereby stir up the "atoms," raise Surya from the depths of the sea, and bring the world into existence. All of these doctrines or images are juxtaposed within this single hymn, with each standing upon its own merits and without any apparent compulsion on the part of the poet to synthesize the various elements into a single systematic whole. One final matter deserves comment: it can be concluded with a reasonable amount of certitude, based upon a reading of the entire hymn, that one of the fundamental principles of the history of religions, as formulated by R. Pettazzoni35 and G. van der Leeuw,36 is exemplified in the declaration that the birth of the gods was preceded by one or more preparatory stages in the cosmogonic process. According to these two writers, the sacred lore of a diverse assortment of religious traditions (both "primitive" and "advanced") throughout the world supports the claim that the gods appeared late rather than early in the history of religions and that their appearance was based upon a prior revelation of a more universalized form of the Sacred. To take the Vedic hymn currently under scrutiny as an example, Daksa and Aditi (and, perhaps, dsat, sat, and the directions, before them) appear prior to 34 The belief that the world was still "bald" (i.e., devoid of trees, plants, and cattle) is recorded in numerous Vedic sources (Sat. Brh. 2,2,4,3-4; Paic. Br. 20,14,5; 13,11,11 ("pasavo vdi loma"); 5,8,1). 35 Pettazzoni, in Eliade and Kitagawa, eds.

DAKSA AS ONE OF THE ADITYAS We observed previously that Daksa is at once the father38 and the son of Aditi. In the older layers of the Vedas, he is described simply as her son and, by virtue of that lineage, is recognized as one of the Adityas.39 In this capacity, Daksa partakes of many of the powers, functions, and character traits that distinguish these offspring of Aditi. To enter into a lengthy discussion of the nature and function of the Adityas in the Vedas would carry us far beyond the useful limits of the present discussion. We will mention only the more characteristic features of the Adityas that are reflected in the character of Daksa. In one of the most informative of all the hymns addressed to the Adityas (R V 2,27), this group of celestials, with Daksa numbered among them, is described as "eternal kings" (sanddrdjabhyo), who are bright (ducayo), free from falsehood (dhdraputd) and guile (avrjind), irreproachable (anavadya) and undeceived (adabdhdso), possessing many eyes by means of which they perceive both good and evil. So extensive are their powers that "even the most distant objects are near to these kings." As the collective embodiment of the solar energies that invigorate and support all forms of life, the Adityas uphold (dhdrayanta) both the moving and the stationary things (jagasthd) and are protectors of the entire world (visvasyabhuvanasya gopdh). They are the pro- 37 See RV 10,129,6b, where it is said that "the gods [came] after the creation of this [world]." 38 In the Visnu Pur. (4,1,10), Aditi is identified as one of the daughters of Daksa. 39 The Adityas are the progeny of Aditi and the divine representatives of the sky vault. In the Brdhmanas (e.g., Sat. Br. 11,6,3,8), they are presented as a group of twelve solar deities who are identified with the twelve months of the year. In the purdnas they come to be associated almost exclusively with the sun and various solar phenomena. Elsewhere, they are the original progeny of Praja- pati: Panc. Br. 13,9,5; 18,8,13; Taitt. Br. 1,8,8,1. Consult 1,89,3 wherein Daksa is invoked "with an ancient hymn" in the company of Bhaga, Mitra, Aditi, Aryaman, Varuna, Soma, and the Asvins, altogether composing the group of eight Adityas. See also 2,27,1 for a slightly different enumeration of the Adityas, seven in number, with Aditi serving as the seventh; compare Brhaddevatd 4,82. Interestingly, there are a number of lists of the Adityas, located primarily in post-Vedic literature, in which Daksa's name does not appear: e.g., RV 6,50,1; 8,18,3; Sayana's commen- tary on 2,27,1; AV 6,4,2; Taitt. Jr. 1,13,3; Paic. Br. 24,12,3-4; MBh. 1,59,15-16; Hariv. 11,548 ff.; Visnu Pur. 1,15,90 ff.; Bhag. Pur. 6,6,25 ff. At MBh. 1,1,31 ff. Daksa is credited with producing "seven sons" and from them the "twenty-one Prajapatis," who are nothing but projections of his own divine nature. This notion of "seven sons" may be a harkening back to the Vedas where Daksa was, in some sense, taken to be the father of the "seven" Adityas. At Taitt. Br. 1,1,9,1, the Adityas are eight in number, but here Daksa is called by the name Dhdtr ("founder arranger, supporter"). Also, in the Hariv. 1154, Daksa is included in a list of the Visvadevas. 42</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions tectors of the eternal law (rta) and the collectors of debts (cayamdnd rndni). In verse 9 of this same chapter, they are eulogized for holding up the three celestial regions of light, "these golden and guileless ones, who never sleep [asvapna], with eyelids never closing [ani'misa], faithful and wide-ruling for the righteous mortal [urusarmd rjave martydya]."40 Elsewhere they are praised for providing protection against malice and wickedness (RV 8,47, 1), for driving away evil (8,47,2), for providing a dwelling place for creatures (8,47,4), and for bestowing happiness upon those who are blessed (8,83,5).41 As an extension of his identity with the Adityas, Daksa is frequently placed in intimate association with Mitra and Varuna (the two foremost Adityas) and is even said to be their father. In two passages (6,50,2; 7,66,2), the gods are praised with the epithet daksa-pitr ("those whose father is Daksa"),42 and in a third passage (8,25,5) two of the Adityas (most probably, Mitra and Varuna) are said to have sprung into being from Daksa alone. Thus, Mitra and Varuna are addressed as "the two sons of Daksa, exceeding strong" (or "wise": s8unf daksasya sukratu) who, as "lords of flowing rain, dwell in the place of food" (Griffith).43 Else- where, those same deities are addressed as "those whose father is ddksa- (or Daksa)" (daksapitard), gods who are "exceedingly wise" (devdh sudaksa daksapitard).44 RV 1,15,6 refers to the fact that Mitra and Varuna "have obtained ddksa-, which is not easy to destroy...," perhaps a reference to a form of knowledge, power, or strength which resistg the destructive effects of both belligerent gods and faithless men. Again, these two sons of Daksa are petitioned to bestow "efficient working power" (daksa. . . apasam) upon those persons who approach them in a prayerful manner (1,2,9). Aditi, who produced 40 See Macdonell, VM, 43-46; W. D. Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society (1853), pp. 323 ff.; J. Muir, OST, 5:54-57; M. Miiller, Vedic Hymns, 252-54; and H. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda (Berlin, 1894), pp. 185-89, for detailed accounts of the Adityas. 41 See J. Gonda, Some Observations, pp. 84 ff. 42 See M. Miiller, Vedic Hymns, p. 247, where he remarks that Roth has suggested a more convincing translation, "fathers of strength"; see also, 3,27,9, where Agni is called "father of strength." 43 Geldner translates this verse as follows: "Die Enkel der grossen Kraft, Daksa's S6hne, die Einsichtsvollen, deren Gaben [den Regen] ausgedehnt sind, wohnen an der Statte der Labung." Gonda translates the verse: "The two children of great heroic power, the sons of D., those of great strength of mind whose fattening gifts are extensive, inhabit the place of refreshment" (see Some Observa- tions, p. 6). 44 RV 7,60,10. The commentator is of the opinion that the compound "ddksa- pitarah" means daksah prajlpatir utpadaka yesam te, "Those of whom the Praja- pati, Daksa is the progenitor." 43</page><page sequence="16">Daksa Mitra and Varuna in union with Daksa, is asked by the singer to call her sons hither "by means of the birth and the sovereignty [or 'the ordinances'; Geldner: 'Walten'] of Daksa." At 7,60,10, both Daksa's lordship over Mitra and Varuna and his existence as an enormous reservoir of creative power, concealed within the depths of being, is alluded to by the poet. In an attitude of fear and trembling before Mitra and Varuna the poet prays that these deities may be gracious to him and his patrons "through the power of Daksa" (daksasya cita mahind mrlatanah).45 In all the passages surveyed in this section of the paper, Daksa has been represented in a number of different roles. As both the coprogenitor of the Adityas and one of their number, he is identi- fied with the limitless expanse of the sky vault and the invigorating powers of the sun. In this same capacity, he is also the father of Mitra and Varuna and perhaps indirectly associated with the protection of the universal law and the solidification of contracts of friendship through his two sons. As the cogenerative partner of Aditi, he is the father of the gods and all the other inhabitants of the creature realm. IV. DAKSA AND AGNI AS "MYTHOLOGICAL DOUBLES" The image of Daksa and Aditi uniting to generate one another calls to mind the popular Vedic notion that the gods, who are children of a primordial divine force, miraculously created their own parents.46 Agni, for example, engendered his own mother (1,95,4) and is himself both the offspring and the progenitor (garbha) of the waters (apdm napdt). Numerous references in the ?Rg-Veda associate Daksa and Agni on intimate terms. At 10,5,7, where it is a question of the birth of Daksa in the womb of Aditi, it appears as though his and Agni's mode of birth are identical. "Nonbeing and Being are in the region of the highest heaven [parame], in the birthplace of Daksa and the lap [upasthe] of Aditi. Agni is, indeed, the first-born of the most ancient law [rtasya purve], the milch-cow and the bull."47 Although it may not 45 See RV 10,123 and AV 2,1,1 ff. Griffith treats ddksa- as an abstract quality and translates this phrase as "even in the greatness of your power, have mercy." 46 For additional references to examples of parents being brought into existence by their own children within the divine realm in the R V, see Macdonell, VM, p. 12. 47 Griffith translates the verse as follows: "Not Being, Being in the highest heaven, in Aditi's bosom and in Daksa's birthplace, is Agni, our first-born of Holy Order, the Milch-cow and Bull in life's beginning." I have chosen to adhere to Geldner's more creditable translation: "Das Nichtseiende und das Seiende ist im hochsten Himmelsraum bei der Geburt des D., in der A. Schoss. Agni fiirwahr ist uns der Erstgeborene des Gesetzes in dem friihesten Zeitalter und der Stier, der auch eine Kuh ist." 44</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions be apparent at first glance, this single verse contains the rudiments of an entire cosmogonic scheme. The standardized Vedic phrase "in the region of the highest heaven" designates a realm or state of being transcendent to this world of phenomenal differentiation.48 Within this transcendent realm, situated in the heavens and extending beyond, the primordial entity is divided into male and female aspects, these two divide personages (or divine principles) reunite to give birth to Daksa "in the lap of Aditi" (this event being expressed in mythological figures as the union between the cosmic bull and cow) and from that union also, Agni is born, presumably in the form of the sun.49 It would not be mere idle speculation to suggest that, while Agni obviously is known to be the son of Daksa and Aditi, he might also be viewed as either identical to, or a "mythological double" of, Daksa. Gonda has observed that numerous deities in the Vedic pantheon have attri- buted to them a status of "sonship," based upon a notion that "rests largely upon their reputation of being representatives or manifestations of certain aspects of their 'father,' although they have, at least in the eyes of prescientific man, a certain independent existence."50 A. Bergaigne has also remarked upon the fact that the features of the "father" and the "son" are often confused and even, in certain instances, equated in the R V.51 One conclusion that might be drawn at this point in the dis- cussion is that, if Agni and Daksa are homologized in the Rg-veda, as we believe the passages cited above indicate, and if Daksa is identified as a divine double or a multiform of Prajapati as the creator god in the Brdhmanas, then, mutatis mutandi, Agni may also be viewed as a mythological surrogate for Prajapati. Thus, Agni, Daksa, and Prajapati converge to form a triadic complex of divine creators whose respective natures are at once identical and distinct. To return now to the passage under discussion (10,5,7), Agni is as yet an undeveloped embryo, both male and female simultane- ously (as Ludwig has suggested), and Daksa himself may be the sun and Aditi the earth, as well (as Miiller has suggested). At any 48 F. B. J. Kuiper (see n. 30 above) argues that the phrase "clearly refers to a place which transcends the dualism of this world, for instance, when Indra is said to hold heaven and earth in the highest heaven. It is no doubt identical with Visnu's third or highest step, which is hidden from mortal eye." 49 Compare RV 1,95,5 where Agni is said to be "visible because he grows up in his own brightness, up-lifted in the lap of the waving waters" and Sdyana's commentary: dsu meghasthasvapsu vaidyutdtmand vartamdno'gniscaruh san dvistyo vardhate. 50 Some Observations, p. 5. 51 See n. 3 above, 3:356. 45</page><page sequence="18">Daksa rate, Daksa and Aditi are the divine personifications of creative power, in its male and female guises respectively, who project into existence all the opposites that constitute the world order (pratha- mdjd rtasya). Together they undertake the task of bringing the world into being, a task which they share with Visvakarman in the Vedas 52 and pass along to Prajapati in the Brdhmanas.53 In the R?g-Veda, however, it is Agni, "the first-born of the most ancient law" and the first fruit of the union of Daksa and Aditi who serves as the cosmogonic agent in the form of solar energy. At RV 10, 128,7 Agni is addressed with epithets that are frequently reserved for Daksa Visvakarman, Tvastr, and others, namely, "Lord of the universe, Creator of Creators." Likewise, RV 3,27,9 mentions the generation of Agni: "By means of prayer the Excellent One was created. He (it) received the germ of being, the child (nom. fem.) of Daksa, the father" (daksasya pitaram tana). At RV 5,25,2 and 6,17,1-2, while it is the earth that is said to receive the germ of life, Aditi may also be thought of as the limitless earth who receives the seed of masculine creative power, from which she brings forth the creatures. Again, at RV 1,95,6, Agni is depicted as the son of Daksa as well as his progenitor and is invoked with the epithet, "the Lord of Might among the mighty" (daksanam daksapatih), as is Indra in other passages.54 Daksa's cosmogonic function is stated forthrightly at RV 10, 121,8, where he is credited with creating the sacrifice, which, in turn, served as both the material basis of the universe and the sole mechanism for its maintenance. The singer praises "him who, in his might surveyed the [cosmic] waters, which had conceived Daksa and [thereby] gave birth to the sacrifice which was the unequalled god among all the gods."55 The overriding sense of the passage is that the primal deity (i.e., Prajapati, here known as "Ka" but later identified with Daksa) hovers over the formless waters as the fecundating spirit whose seed is deposited in the 52 A V 6,122,1. 63 Compare A V 4,35,1; 12,1,61. 54 See Miller, Vedic Hymns, pp. 245 ff.; Bergaigne, 3:93 ff.; and 5,16,2 where Agni is "the sacrificial priest of men with dawn (generated) in the arms of the Skilful One (ddksa)"; and 5,10,2, where Agni is eulogized as "Thou [who] art worthy of our devotion because of the wisdom and purposiveness of your will"; also see 3,14,6-7. 55 Mahina paryapasydddaksam; compare Renou's translation: "enturait du regard sce Eaux," Hymnes Speculatifs du Veda (Paris, 1956), pp. 119-21. Renou remarks concerning this verse, "les poetes tracent en pensee une d6marcation entre les forces males et les forces f6minines" (p. 254). 46</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions liquid womb of the female to produce the cosmos.56 As in 10,82, 4-5, so here, Daksa is either a highly individuated creator deity or an abstract principle of creation, d6dksam, "die Wirkenskraft sich zulegen."57 This power, ddksam, like the Golden Germ (hiranya- garbha) 5 floats upon or lies within the waters as an embryo from which the sacrifice (and, along with it, the universe) springs into being. Finally, Daksa's active role in producing all forms of life and in promoting their health and well-being is clearly attested to in a prayer addressed to the Asvins, who are said to be "won- drously strong" and to have "won Daksa's praise" because of their skill in the art of healing.59 V. DAKSA AS AN ABSTRACT TERM OF DESCRIPTION AND DESIGNATION One of the distinctive features of Indian thought, in both ancient and modern times, is the conviction that the boundaries between various states of mind, modes of existence, and levels of conscious- ness, within both the divine and human worlds, are phenomenally real only and hence have only functional or contextual value. Dialectically speaking, the particular form through which divinity is manifested in a given instance depends upon both the mode of manifestation chosen by the deity and the level of perception of the human recipient of the revelation. Gonda has observed correctly that the radical separation in the minds of most western writers, from the Greeks onward, between the personal and impersonal manifestations of divine power simply did not exist in the minds of the Vedic poet-sages.60 The reason for this lack of separation of the two classes of concepts in Indian culture is that the sages, poets, and mythographers viewed the personal and impersonal aspects of divinity, not so much as ontologically distinct spheres of being, as different aspects or poles within the one divine nature. One finds in both Vedic and post-Vedic litera- 56 Compare Gen. 1:2 where it is said that "the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters"; consult also C. H. Long, Alpha (New York, 1963), esp. the chap. entitled "World-Parent Myths." 57 According to Sdyana's commentary on VS 27,26, Daksa is Prajapati, the creator of the world and lord of creatures. Compare 10,81,1 where the sacrifice is represented as the precondition for the appearance of a creator. 58 RV 10,121. 59 RV 8,75,1 (Muller; Skt. text: ubha hi dasra bhisajd mayobhuvobhd daksasya vacaso babhuvatuh); see also H. Grassmann, Rig-Veda, 2 vols. (Leipzig, 1876), 1:501: "Ihr beide seid erfreunde Wunderarzte ja, mit kraft'gem Zuspruch waret ihr versehn von je." 60 Some Observations, p. 5; see also Macdonell, VM, p. 46; and Muir OST, 5:52. 47</page><page sequence="20">Daksa ture that these two "modes of manifestation" tend to alternate, with now one and then the other coming into view. The interchangeability of the two aspects of the divine nature is exemplified in a striking manner in the Vedic poets' declaration that the various gods are but different forms of the one divine reality, which itself is envisioned to assume both personal and impersonal, theistic and nontheistic guises (e.g., Purusa, Indra, Rudra, etc., and Tad iRkam, Hiranyagarbha, etc., respectively). This theological principle bursts into full blossom in the epics and purdnas with the development of the concept of Trimfrti, a triadic form of divinity in which Brahma, Visnu, and Siva appear as both independent and interdependent facets of the one godhead. Another dramatic example of this principle of the interchange- ability of the personal and impersonal modes of being is found in the Kdlikd Purana, where Visnu is commissioned by all the other gods to attempt to assuage Siva's grief over the death of his beloved wife, Sati. Visn.u accomplishes this feat by reminding Siva that, in addition to being this personalized deity who possesses consciousness, feelings, and compulsions of various sorts, and who is suffering profound pangs of grief over the loss of a loved one, he (8iva) is, within his essential nature, the boundless, impartite eternal absolute (i.e., the Brahman), wholly transcendent to the world of death and rebirth (sahrsdra). As such, he is unaffected at the core of his being by the suffering with which he is afflicted in his manifest (sakala) state.61 To apply this principle to the case before us, it should be said that the fluid conception of divinity and the interchangeability of the levels of divine manifestation within the world makes it highly problematic, when analyzing a piece of textual material, to determine whether one is dealing with a deity (Daksa) or an impersonal principle (daksa). While it would be indefensible to argue that the Vedic poets made no real distinction between the two aspects of reality and the two classes of ideas, it appears from the texts that they did make allowances for a far greater flexibility within each sphere and provided for an easier and more natural transition from one area of conceptualization to the other than has generally been the case in the western literary tradition. With this assertion as our guiding principle, we turn now to survey the occurrences of the term ddksa- in which it is provided an abstract significance. It is our hope that the introduction of 61 See H. Zimmer, The King and the Corpse (New York, 1960), pp. 303-4. 48</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions these abstract uses of the term will uncover certain resonances in the personal usage of the word which otherwise would not emerge. One of the primary reasons for the proliferation of such a wide range of interpretations of the term ddksa and of the deity desig- nated by the word is that its precise meaning is difficult to deter- mine. Etymologically related to the Greek eto'ds and Latin dexter, meaning "on the right (hand or side)" and by extension "dexterous, expert, skilful," the connotations of daksa- in the Vedas extend beyond even this wide range of meanings. By including within our scope the entire range of Indo-European etymologies, we find that ddksa- is also cognate with Gothic taihswa, French droit, German recht, Italian destro, Lithuanian desinas, and Avestan dasina-all derived from a more primitive Indo-European form *deksua62 and signifying "on the right or auspicious side" of anything, as opposed to the "left and inauspicious side." In the form of a transitive verb, daksati, the term conveys the idea of acting correctly, properly, in conformity with a certain principle or law, or to the satisfaction of the wishes of some person. It may also denote the sense of making something right or bringing a thing or course of action into line with a preestablished norm. As a verb in the middle voice, the word means "to be able, to be capable of" and may, quite possibly, be distantly related to the semi-infinitive dative ddksase, "to worship, laud, revere, or serve," with the latter term indirectly derived from the Sanskrit root Vds = "to give, offer, bestow" (see 1,151,3). Again, there are numerous instances in the Vedas where ddksa- appears in a substantive form63 to denote a particular state of mind or heart (courage, perseverance), a divine lineage ("son of strength" or "son of wisdom"), a certain highly desirable mental ability (adroitness, deliberateness, resoluteness), an acute religious sensitivity (spiritual insight coupled with poetic eloquence), an effective capacity for moral discrimination (discernment of the difference between good and evil), or a potent state of being (inherent strength, physical vitality, or the gift of healing). When employed as a substantive with reference to the nature of gods, human beings, or phenomena, dadksa- generally denotes such 62 Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. dexterity; see also C. D. Buck, A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principle Indo-European Languages (Chicago, 1949), pp. 864-65. 63 Renou, Etudes, pp. 31 ff. (see n. 3 above). 49</page><page sequence="22">Daksa qualities as "dexterity, adroitness, skilfulness, or shrewdness: Tiichtigkeit, Tauglichkeit, Fahigkeit or Kraftigkeit."64 Throughout the Rg-Veda, there are instances where a poet or priest eulogizes one god or many for the possession of such qualities as radiance, strength, intelligence, wealth, etc., with the view toward obtaining for himself and for those whose cause he represents the same powers which are praised in the deity. In other words, the beneficial boons which mankind receives from the deities are embodiments of certain divine qualities of which the gods themselves are constituted. Agni, for example, is worshipped as the god who possesses "effective strength," who bestows that same power upon the petitioner (RV 1,95,6). Indra, who derives the strength and courage required to defeat Vrtra by consuming gargantuan draughts of Soma, is also renowned for his capacity to "bestow skill [or strength] upon the Soma-pourer" (1,56,2; 5,38,4; 7,32,12). Again, the singer eulogizes the Visvadevas as a group, but singles out the balmy winds for their "powers to restore life to the sinner," and in a buoyant mood of thanksgiving, he declares, "I bring you healing power (daksam te bhadram), I drive away your consumption." A V 7,14,1 contains a panegyric addressed to Savitar in which that divine embodiment of solar energy is invoked as the "household deity" who possesses the capacity to "assign to the Fathers, treasure (rdtnam), dexterity (daksam), and life-times (dyusim). "65 The term ddksa- is applied in numerous instances to both Agni (3,14,7) and Soma (9,61,18; 62,4; 10,144,1) with the connotation of clever, strong, or skillful. RV 1,51,2 contains a reference to "the skilful Rbhus," who are asked to render aid to the inebriated Indra in his conflict with the mighty drought-causing demon, Vrtra. Agni (6,15,3) is entreated to "be a helper of the skillful man" (sa tvam daksasydvrko vrdho bhiuh), and Vaisvanara Agni is described as being "skilled as a human priest [hotr] in proclaiming praises" (1,59,4).66 Gratified by the skill (ddaksami) of the Soma-bringer (i.e., Indra), the supplicant promises to "make him his friend and companion." 67 In addition, RV 1,91,7 represents Soma as being capable of 64 0.

Indra is petitioned with the prayer, "And from whatever spiritual power [daksdsya, Geldner: 'deiner Geisteskraft'] it may be, 0 Vrtra-slayer, give us courage" (5,38,4). As previously observed, Agni is addressed on numerous occasions as the "son of strength" (daksa-pitr), who distributes many blessings to the gods (3,14,6). Siirya, and all the other deities who suffuse the universe with life-giving light, are said to be the off- spring of ddksa [or Daksa] and "Protectors of Truth (themselves) truthful, holy, observant of sacred rites, having Agni as their tongue." At the midpoint of our survey of references in the Rg-veda to ddksa as an abstract concept, we will risk pointing out the obvious by observing that, whether conceived to be a deity or a pheno- menon, both Daksa and ddksa- are identified with that which is invigorating, supporting, fructifying, nurturing, and gratifying to both gods and men. It is by means of the transmission of these powers of life, health, wealth, creative thought, and effective action from the divine to the human realm that the creatures are sustained and enabled to assume their appropriate tasks within the cosmic scheme. Daksa's role as the chief patron of sacrificial rites in post-Vedic literature is based, in large part, upon his Vedic association with fecundating and supporting power that is distri- buted among the gods and men by means of the sacrifice itself. There are a great many additional passages in the Rg-veda in which ddksa- is used to signify wealth, success, and general well- being. Indra is praised for his ability to discover "flourishing power" or "expanding power" (vrdhdsya daksaso) by virtue of his mighty strength (8,13,1). Again, he is said to purify his praise- worthy spirit and to discover (i.e., recover) his abundant energy (ddksam) with the flowing of the Soma beverage. Elsewhere, Mitra and Varuna are extolled for their great strength (ddksase mahe) derived from their double birth (i.e., from heaven and earth).68 In addition to these various shades of meaning pertaining to creative power in general, dcksa also carries the more specific significance of "mental power," powers of mind and will, extra- ordinary capacity for deliberation and decision, together with the ability to act "decisively." The use of the term to designate intellectual adroitness is exemplified at 5,66,4, which speaks of 68 A vam bhuSanksitayo jdnma rodasyoh pravacyam vrsana daksase mahe. 51</page><page sequence="24">Daksa "the fortresses of d6dka where are housed the poetic virtues [which] are those of understanding." As to the latter usage, one finds at 8,48,8 that King Soma is approached with the plea to "bless us and bring us prosperity ... understanding [dadksa] and zeal [manyii], stir within us...." Again, the poet declares that "when you, Mitra and Varuna separated falsehood from truth by your own zeal [manyi], by the zeal of your ddksa" (1,139,2).69 In this passage, the "volitional" dimension of the term ddksa- is accentuated, where the reference is made to "volonte" (will), willpower, or perseverance (Renou: "force de volonte"), or strength of will (Geldner: "Willenskraft") in such passages as na sd svo ddksah ... dhrutih sa (7,86,6: "not our own will betrayed us but seduction"). Daksa, understood in this sense, represents an intellectual and volitional capacity which the gods bestow upon those humans who deserve it by virtue of the praise and sacrificial oblations which they previously have delivered to the gods. With regard to the use of the term ddksa- as a designation of an abstract mental faculty, Renou observes that the word quite frequently is linked to manyu! or krdtu and is placed in apposition to those terms (e.g., krdtve ddksdya, utcd manyuh).70 Furthermore, when a distinction is made between the two terms, krdtu and ddksa, as the "force deliberante" that enables a person to "consult" or "deliberate" (sam-vad), ddksa- is the force of realization.71 This principle is also exemplified in the word ddksasadhana, which Renou renders as "la voie vers l'acts concret, ce qu'on 'Saisit' [grbh] par le pensee [manasd]."72 Within this same general frame of reference, d6ksa- is occasion- ally employed in speaking of divine sages who are possessed of "poetic vision" or "spiritual inspiration" (dhih).73 An example of this usage is found at 8,42,3 (imam dhiyam sgiksamdnasya deva kratum daksami varuna sam sisgddhi), which Renou translates as "moi qui m'exerce a ce poeme-ci, dieu, 0 Varuna, aiguise [en moi] la force inspirante, la force agissante." He argues that krdtu and 69 Compare 1,2,7, and D. P. Patanjal Shastri, A Critical Study of Rigveda (New Delhi, 1963), pp. 245-46, where the root /dAks- is interpreted as gatihinsanayoh, "to move" or "be energetic." 70 Etudes, p. 31. 71 Ibid., p. 31. For additional instances where krdtu and ddksa are juxtaposed as complementary functions, see RV 10,31,2; 1,139,2; 4,10,2; 10,57,4; AV 6,19,2; 18,2,23; Tattt. Br. 1,5,4,2; Vaj. Sam. 33,72. 72 Manu 1,35 identifies krdtu as intelligent personified, a son of Brahma and one of the ten Prajapatis or Rsis. Krdtu is also said to be married to Kriyd ("religious action"), who in turn is identified as one of the daughters of Daksa. 73 Etudes, p. 32. 52</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions ddksa are "nettement complementaires, les deux stades de la realisation, conception et mise en oeuvre."74 In commenting on Renou's interpretation of this passage, Gonda adds that when krdtu and daksa are employed in portraying two types of mental or spiritual activity, krdtu suggests "resourcefulness, inventive- ness" and daksa, "ability, dexterity, expertness." In other words, dacksa and krdtu are two intellectual qualities needed to bring a poetic enterprise to a successful conclusion.75 As previously noted, this same sense of the term is represented at RV 1,2,7 where Mitra and Varuna are invoked to make the dhih (vision) successful, with the noun daksa, signifying "skill" or "practical efficiency."76 A most vivid example of the juxtaposition of intelligence (krdtu) and volition (ddaksa), is found at Sat. Br. 4,1,4,1, with each of the mental faculties or powers identified with one of the two foremost representatives of the Adityas. "Mitra and Varuna, indeed, are his (i.e., the Sacrifice's) intelligence and will: and, as such, belong- ing to his self: whenever he desires anything in his mind (manasa) ... that is krdtu; and whenever that is accomplished, that is dadksa. Now indeed, krdtu is Mitra and daksa is Varuna; and Mitra is the brahma (priesthood), and Varuna, the ksatra (nobility); and the brahma is the conceiver (abhigata: lit. 'the approacher'), and the ksatra is the doer (kartd)." By implication, then, daksa- or Daksa is the "doer," the active force or motive power which brings to a state of fulfilment a design previously conceived by Mitra, the brahma.77 Finally, the root Vddks-, is occasionally used to signify "to be successful" (7,32,9, where the term is placed in opposition to sridh- "to fail, to err" or at 1,89,3, where the same significance is intended in the epithet asridh of Daksa) or "to render homage." In this second sense /ddks- is merely an augmentation of the root /das-, which is the base of the word dasasyati and is analogous to the derivation of bhaks- from bhaj- and naks- from nas-, etc.78 74 Ibid. 75 Etudes Vedique, 5:93, 6:71. These and other related matters are discussed in greater detail by Gonda in The Vision of the Vedic Poets (The Hague, 1963), p. 111 (see n. 5 above), and Epithets in the Rgveda (The Hague, 1959), p. 159. 76 Renou, Etudes Vedique, 4:18, 88; 7:21: "le kratu- se r6alise au moyen du daksa-: l'un est (en gen6ral) le propre des dieux, le don des dieux a homme, l'autre appartient (plut6t) aux humains par nature." 77 J. Eggling, Satapatha-Brdhmana, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 26 (Oxford, 1889), pp. 269-70. The idea that Daksa is the "doer" par excellence will form the leitmotif of many of the myths related to him in the epics and purdnas. The dominant impression of him derived from those stories is, that he is the deity or sage-he is represented in both capacities-who possesses sacrificial skill to a supreme degree or is himself the embodiment of the power of the sacrifice. 78 Etudes, p. 32. 53</page><page sequence="26">Daksa After taking into account all of the various ways in which ddksa and its many derivations are employed in the ?Rg-veda, Renou concludes that the term appears to have had a twofold employ- ment which stems from "la double origine." On the one hand, the term signifies "success" or "prosperity," a favorable condition resulting from a correct decision made in the past (1,151,3: "[Our birth has been a decisive factor] for the great prosperity of the two worlds"; see 8,13,1).79 On the other hand, in the form of a semi- infinitive dative, daksase, the term bears the sense of "to pay homage" or "to receive homage," (6,48,1), in this instance, approximating the meaning of -dd- (dasasy = "to honor, to serve"). In all probability, this double sense of the term must be preserved in tact in recognition of the fact that the term ddksa cannot be reduced to a single linguistic root. VI. DAKSA IN POST-RGVEDIC LITERATURE A. IN THE ATHARVA VEDA There are only a few scattered references to Daksa in the post- R?gvedic literature, and those passages that mention his name, almost without exception, yield no information that would assist us in tracing the mythic and ideological continuities between the Rg-veda and the Mahdbhdrata. One of the primary reasons for the infrequent appearance of Daksa in the later Vedic texts is that by that point in time he had come to be identified almost completely with Prajapati, as the creator of the universe, the lord of creatures, and the embodiment of the sacrifice. Even in those passages where the name Daksa appears in isolation, many features are attributed to him that also quite properly belong to Prajapati. On this basis, we might assume that the names of the two deities have come to be used almost synonymously, with either appella- tion signifying both figures. Nor have the poets' conceptions of Daksa undergone any remarkable alterations during this period. For, he appears in later texts to be identified with virtually the same features and functions as in the Rg-Veda; namely, physical and mental fortitude, intellectual agility, longevity, and creative action of assorted types. In the first book of the A V (35,1-3) there is a prayer for longevity (gatasdrada, "a hundred autumns"), strength, safety, and welfare; the prayer is addressed either to a golden amulet or to some 79 Jdnma rddasyoh ... ddksase mah'. 54</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions unspecified deity with the power to infuse the amulet with the necessary invigorating potencies.80 The "descendants of Daksa," who are described as "well-willing" and who bound this amulet to Satanika, are mentioned in this verse but without further elabora- tion. The next verse identifies the amulet as "the first-born force of the gods" and as a possession of the "descendants of Daksa" (ddksdyand hiranya), a potent object that can "yield long life among the living." By means of this charm (perhaps both the amulet and the prayer addressed to it), the water's brilliancy, light, force, and strength (ddksamdna),81 as well as the heroic powers (virya) of the trees of the forest, will be sustained within the body of its bearer (verse 3). In this passage, as in the Rg-vedic materials, the personal and impersonal aspects of ddksa are "confused" or "interfused" and, like comparable concepts of the all-pervasive, sacred power of life in other cultures (e.g., mana among the Melanesians, wakan among the Sioux, or orenda among the Iroquois), the ancient Vedic poets and sages may have conceived ddksa to be that sacred power that pervades the whole of the natural world and manifests itself dramatically in any extraordinary person, animal, object, or situation.82 Elsewhere (AV 6,4,1) Aditi is enjoined to "now protect our hard-to-surpass [and] saving power" which serves us well in times of hardship. In another hymn, traditionally chanted on the occasion of the upanayana as a prayer for length of life, a certain "ability" or "dexterity" (daksatati) is bestowed upon the recipient of the blessing, with the result that he will enjoy a long life (jivatu) and, in advanced age (jirvi) will possess the strength to address the council with eloquence. No doubt this virtue of "strength" refers to agility of body, mind, and tongue, a general state of good health achieved by the acquisition of this daksatati. Again in the A V (5,25,1-3) there is a petition for the ability to assemble the energies of life from the cloud (?parvata), the womb (yoni), the sky and from every member and to place it in the womb, even as the skilled archer or arrow maker sets the feather squarely in the shaft of the arrow.83 In a highly sacramental culture such as that of Vedic India, it was exceedingly important, indeed crucial, that 80 Compare A V 5,28,5. 81 Commentary on this verse: "daksa means vardhamdna, 'growing, increasing."' 82 Consult M. Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion (New York, 1959), pp. 19 ff. 83 Macdonell, (VM, p. 12) remarks that this metaphor is employed in the Vedas (e.g., RV 10,18,14b) to signify the possession of effective skill in performing a difficult task. 55</page><page sequence="28">Daksa the priests who promote the maintenance of the cosmos and provide life, wealth, and general well-being to its inhabitants by means of the sacrifice, possess the effective skill (ddksa-sacdhana) to discern the appropriate hymn to be composed or recited on a given occasion, the most auspicious time and place for a sacrifice, and even the most fitting meter for each hymn. It is this highly efficacious knowledge, combining spiritual wisdom and technical knowledge, that is designated by the terms Daksa and ddksa. At A V 13,2,37 a rather arcane reference is made to "the son of Aditi" (? Daksa), who is either equated with or related to "the eagle running on the back of the sky." The latter phrase contains an obvious reference to the sun,84 which the supplicant asks to "stretch out for us a long lifetime." In another passage (2,4,1), ddkcsa bears the standard significance of "being capable," "being able" in the most general sense of the word.85 B. IN THE BRAHMANAS In the Rg-veda, the figure of Daksa is projected in such vague and abstract outlines, his person and activities are so far removed from the sphere of human life, that except for his identification with Prajapati in the later Sathhitds and Brdhmanas, he might well have experienced the same fall into oblivion as the ancient celestial god Dyaus. Although we have very few textual references upon which to draw in reconstructing the mythological and ritual basis for the mutual assimilation of Daksa and Prajapati, the rationale is not difficult to discern. Both deities are divine personi- fications of creative power, who, either by means of asceticism86 or sexual congress with their respective wives-daughters,87 gave birth to the gods and thence to the rest of the creatures. For example, at Ait. Br. (3,33-34), Prajapati, in the form of a stag, pursues his daughter (either the sky or the dawn), who has assumed the form of a doe, in order to engage in sexual intercourse. Although the Ait. Br. does not state his intentions, the version in the Kaus. Br. (6,1-9) states that he pursues his daughter in order to produce abundant progeny. Again, Prajapati's incestuous relations with his daughter and his conflict with Rudra over the impropriety of this deed, as well as his employment of sexual intercourse as a 84 Recall Daksa's status as one of the Adityas and his close association with Surya, Agni, and other divine embodiments of light. 85 See 2,29,3; 4,13,2,5; 5,28,5; 7,14,4; 5,22,1; 6,93,3. 86 See RV 10,129,3, where Prajapati creates the cosmos by means of asceticism (tapas). 87 See Ait. Br. 3,33-34. 56</page><page sequence="29">History of Religions means of producing offspring, no doubt played an important role in promoting the identification of Prajapati with Daksa. The merger of the two deities is complete when, in the Mahdbhdrata88 and the purdnas,89 they are addressed by means of a single name, Daksa-Prajapati or "Daksa, who is one of the Prajapatis" (i.e., one of the demiurges who performs the actual work of creating the universe).90 That Daksa increasingly came to be associated with the brdh- manical sacrifice, and with the sacerdotal skill required for its performance, is confirmed by the specific identification of him with Prajapati within the context of a ritual, performed either by or on behalf of his descendants, namely, the Ddkasyandyajna.91 The term itself refers to "that which is derived from or related to Daksa [Hariv] or Daksi (Pan. 4,2,112)" and may indicate any male or female descendant of Daksa (namely, Aditi, Diti, Kadrii, etc.).92 The word ddk.syana also appears in mythic, ritual, and legal texts (e.g., Manu 6,10) to mean the "southern direction" or "on the southern side," with the object named thereby considered to be invested with auspicious powers.93 This is not the proper place to enter into a lengthy description of this brdhmanical ritual. We will limit ourselves to a few brief comments upon the main features of the rite which illuminate the basis of the identification of Parajapati and Daksa. First, it should be observed that this ritual is a modified form of the Agnihotra, with the oblation, composed of ghee, rice cakes, and curds, presented to Agni-Soma and Agni-Indra at the times of the new and full moons, respectively. Each of the main liturgical acts is to be accompanied by a loud exclamation "grow," or "increase" (vrdh). The following verses emphasize the convictions among the priests during the period of the Brdhmanas that the sacrifice was the most efficacious, if not the only, means of achieving a general state of well-being by enumerating the "fruits" to be realized 88 1,70,1 ff., where Daksa is so addressed. 89 See Vdyu Pur. (65,121 ff.), where the self-created Brahma delegates Daksa to create progeny, with the latter employing first yogic asceticism and then sexual intercourse as a mode of creation. 90 See O'Flaherty, pp. 283-86 (see n. 6 above), for a detailed analysis of the Vedic background of Daksa-Prajapati and Daksa's conflict with Biva. 91 For a more detailed account of this rite, consult Keith, RPVU, pp. 319 ff. 92 Compare MBh. 1,70,1 ff. and Bhdg. Pur. 4,1; the term is used in later litera- ture in referring to the twenty-seven naksatras, or lunar asterisms, whom Daksa bestows upon Candra in marriage. 93 Note in this connection Miva's manifestation as the world-guru and patron of the fine arts, under the rubric Daksina-murti; see J. Bruce Long, "?iva as Promul- gator of Traditional Learning and Patron Deity of the Fine Arts," Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 52 (1972): 67-80. 57</page><page sequence="30">Daksa from this ritual, namely, progeny, prosperity, authority, com- panionship of the gods, a lofty position in society, royal dignity, and victory or superiority over one's enemies (Sat. Br. 2,4,4,1-15). One additional point should be emphasized. The fact that Daksa-Prajapati is mentioned only once during this rite, and then only at the very beginning of the recitation of sacred texts, should not be interpreted as an indication that this deity is incidental to the "meaning" of the rite. By attributing the first performance of the Ddksdyana-yajna to Parajapati, by identifying that deity with the father of the gods in the Rg-Veda (i.e., Daksa), and by locating the divine model for the rite "in the beginning," before the foundation of the world, the text attests to the fact that it is this primordial deity, the creator of the universe and father of the gods, who bestows the blessings of progeny, wealth, etc., upon the devout sacrificer. And, again, based upon the brdhmanical belief that the microcosm and the macrocosm intersect at the place of the sacrifice, as has been demonstrated in the works of numerous Indologists-namely, Bergaigne, Renou, and Hillebrandt94-it is possible to conclude that even such a ritual as this, with its emphasis upon such "local" concerns as wealth, health, fame, etc., also controls those cosmic powers which maintain the entire world order. Two conclusions may be drawn from the foregoing discussion. First, the Dksdcyana-yajna serves both the micro- and macro- cosmic realms as a means of restoring and supporting the powers of life; and, second, Prajapati-Daksa is the High God, the Creator95 and the Lord of Creatures, whose invigorating presence makes possible the salutary activities of the lesser deities (Agni, Soma, and Indra) in providing the sacrificer and his family with those material, social, and spiritual benefits that are the essential pre- requisites of a meaningful and profitable existence. VII. CONCLUSION Despite the relative paucity of references to Daksa in the Vedas, we have found that the term ddksa has had a reasonably rich and multivalent history in that literature. Given the scanty evidence 94 "Recherches sur l'histoire de la liturgie vedique," Journal Asiatique (1889), 1st pt., pp. 1 ff., and Religion Vedique, vol. 1; Religions of Ancient India (London, 1953), p. 17; and Ritual-Literatur: Vedische Opfer und Zauber (Strassburg, 1897), respectively. 95 In Yaska's Nirukta (12,36), in a brief commentary on RV 2,27,1, Daksa is singled out of the group of six Adityas with the assignment of a special epithet, "the creator of many births." 58</page><page sequence="31">History of Religions at our disposal, it would be illegitimate to attempt to forge a single, monolithic image of Daksa in the Vedas by synthesizing all the fragments of his character into a unified whole. It does seem feasible, however, following this rather extensive review and analysis of most of the significant textual materials pertaining to both Daksa and ddksa-, to see whether we cannot formulate a coherent mosaic of the working conceptions of him among the Vedic poets and sages. First of all, as a term of personal address, Daksa designates the original male deity, both the descendant of Aditi and her male consort, with whom she unites to give birth to the gods and all the other creatures. As the procreator of Aditi, Daksa is the undiffer- entiated reservoir of creative power of elan vital which preceded even the birth of the gods and which gave birth to "the Infinite One" or simply "Infinity." As the offspring of Aditi, he is one of a group of six or eight Adityas and is closely associated with the celestial regions of the sky and with the Sun. In connection with the latter association, Daksa is represented as the source of life- bestowing light and warmth, the creator and nourisher of all forms of life. Numerous passages also identify him as the father of specific deities (notably, Mitra and Varuna, the chiefs of the Adityas and Agni, "the first-born of the Ancient Law"). That he appears to be both identical to Agni (with the latter god under- stood to be a "double" of the Sun and the "first born" of creation) and his father merely reinforces the idea that Daksa is both the initiator and primal offspring of the entire cosmogonic process. We discovered, again, that either in the form of "Ka-Prajapati," who impregnates the waters by means of tapas or impregnates his daughter through sexual means, or in the form of ddksa-, an impersonal force that is conceived by or within the waters, Daksa is the creator of the universe by means of the sacrifice. As a "double" of Prajapati he is the divine prototype of the sacrificial priest and the embodiment of both sacrificial skill and indeed, the sacrifice itself. In a word, Daksa is conceived by the Vedic sages to be that divine power or principle who (or which) creates, orders, nourishes, supports, strengthens, inspires, enlightens, prospers, and heals the universe and its multitudinous inhabitants by means of the enormous reservoir of divine energy (tejas) which he has at his disposal and, in a real sense, is. A mere listing of the features, qualities, and entities that this term has designated in the Vedas would have to include the following: manual skill or nimble handedness; mental cleverness, 59</page><page sequence="32">Daksa intelligence, understanding, power of deliberation, and poetic inspiration; expertise in contrivance and skill in management; moral discernment and moral decisiveness; effective power, power of life, or power of healing; prosperity, success, and, by extension, general well-being. These, then are the conceptions of Daksa and ddksa- in the most ancient layer of Indian literature. In post-Vedic literature, Daksa assumes many novel tasks, offices, and character traits, and his personality expands in many directions that are scarcely hinted at in the Vedas. The epic and purdnic writers will represent him in the role of god or sage (depending upon the text in question), who fathers a number of divine daughters (either twenty-four, forty- four, fifty, or sixty in all) and betroths them to a number of deities (notably, Dharma, Kasyapa, Candra, and Siva). In his capacity as archetypal officiant at the divine sacrifice, Daksa will fall victim to Siva's wrath for his refusal to grant Siva and his spouse, Sati, an invitation to the grand event. While many of the features of the epic and purdnic Daksa have been previewed in the Vedas, a number of the most significant elements in his character in the later literature are novel developments, and, we must assume, are reflections of some of the radical alterations in the Indian religious tradition that occurred during that 400-year interval between the time of the Brdhmanas and the earliest stages of the epic period.
