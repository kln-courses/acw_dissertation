<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE 35 THE CHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE By R. C. H. Sweeney, f.z.s. THE Chelonia, or Tortoises, Turtles and Terrapins, include the most primitive of living reptiles and there are some 250 living species scattered throughout the world. In Nyasaland the Order is represented by six species: two tortoises, one turtle and three terrapins. The key at the end of this article will enable the reader to distinguish between them. Testudinidae (Tortoises). 1. Kinixys belliana (Gray,) 1831. Hinged Tortoise. Kamba; Furu; Ngongo. This is the common tortoise of Nyasaland and is widespread in the Protectorate being found from at least 6,000 feet above sea-level to the lowest elevations in Nyasaland, and from Port Herald in the south to Karonga in the north. I have recorded it near both these places, in many parts of the Lower River, in the Shire Highlands and on the Lake Shore. It has been recorded also from Zomba, Mtimbuka, Chibotela, Chitala, Monkey Bay, Likangala, Fort Johnston, etc. The Hinged Tortoise is from 10-12 inches in length when adult, with a convex carapace* patterned with a more or less radiating design of 5 or 6-sided figures, yellowish-brown black and yellow in colour. The colouring is very variable, however, and may be very dark brown in which case the pattern may be obscured. The plastron* has also a symmetrical battern of etched lines, like thin cracks, and is horn-coloured put usually splashed or blotched with black or brown markings. The hinder part of the carapace closes down on the plastron by means of a ligamentous hinge and can be closed at will. This hinge, however, is absent in young specimens although there is usually a trace of it. The feet are clawed and the forelimbs are equipped with 5 claws each normally, occasionally only 4 claws. The edges of the jaws are not dentate or serrated to any degree. The tail is comparatively long in the male, short in the female. *The shell of a tortoise is divided into two main parts; the carapace, or upper shell on the back, and the plastron, or lower shell on the ventral surface. The two parts are joined at the sides but the ends are open for the appendages.</page><page sequence="2">36 THE NYASALAND JOURNAL This tortoise is largely to be found in open savanna country and is scarce or absent usually in other types of country. It feeds in the wild on all kinds of vegetable matter, particularly on the fallen fruits of many trees including figs, Heeria reticulata (Mbewe), Sclerocarya caffra (Mfula), Dichrostachys glomerata (Cipangala), Azanza garckeana (Mtowo), Piliostigma thonningii (Citimbe), broken baobab fruits, etc.; roots of some plants; grasses; fallen fruits of semi-wild or cultivated plants such as mangoes, banana, paw-paws; sugar-cane; fruits of Hibiscus spp. and occasionally fallen cotton bolls; fungi and the leaves of various plants, etc. The diet is by no means an entirely vegetarian one, however, although this is thought to be so by some people. I can think of no vertebrate, in fact, that is either strictly herbivorous or strictly carnivorous and the Chelonia are no exception. The Hinged Tortoise will eat the larvae of insects occasionally, and carrion, and in captivity will eat raw meat readily in the case of most specimens. The enemies are numerous, man being the worst in most areas. Various carnivorous mammals attack the Hinged Tortoise, including hyenas and occasionally leopards. Younger specimens are eaten by the smaller Mustelids and Viverrids, older specimens by larger ones like the Ratel (Mellivora capensis). Younger specimens are eaten also by the larger birds of prey, while the eggs are devoured by many small animals including Monitor-lizards, the larger Gerrhosaurid lizards, rats and other rodents and other small mammals. Monitor-lizards (both Varanus niloticus and V. exthematicus) will attack adults even, sometimes chewing off a limb since they cannot crush the shell. It is probable that the small carnivorous mammals will do the same when given a chance for maimed tortoises are by no means rare. Although in nature in the more populated areas (human populations) a Hinged Tortoise would be lucky to live as long probably, it has a longevity of at least 10 years. Nine years and nine months appears to be the longest period that this species has been kept alive in captivity (Conant and Hudson, 1949). The Hinged Tortoise has little aggressive defence against its enemies, although many potential enemies must be foiled by the hard shell and the passive defence that it adopts. When</page><page sequence="3">THE GHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE 37 alarmed or molested the tortoise withdraws its arms and legs, head and tail into the shell, and firmly closely the hind end of the carapace, at the same time folding its forelimbs to close the front end of its shell. The plastron projects slightly in front of the carapace forming an additional defensive obstacle. In much a manner it forms a tight unit and lies completely motionless. Although tortoises are quite deaf they are keen sighted and sensitive to ground vibrations, so they are fairly well prepared to adopt this defensive posture, and when alarmed they will do so surprisingly rapidly. In this manner the tortoise must avoid many possible enemies?especially such a noisy, clumsy creature as man with his poor sense of smell?by being mistaken for a natural rock or mound of earth or being entirely unnoticed and passed by. Apart from a few animals, of which the hyaenas and jackals are the chief, only a hungry animal is likely to bother with an adult tortoise even if it is seen or smelt, for few animals can get more than a mouthful or two from the limbs without a great deal of difficulty and a lot of time spent. Only a very small animal is likely to have the patience to wait until the tortoise cautiously pushes out its limbs again and starts lumber? ing off, for the Hinged Tortoise will never move until it is reasonably sure that the coast is clear; even then it cautiously takes a long peep before stretching out its neck fully. In captivity, of course, it will became very bold and after a time may even refuse to adopt its defensive posture at all. Actively to repel an aggressor, all the Hinged Tortoise can do is to void an unpleasant, pungent-smelling cloacal fluid, snap its beak and struggle with its limbs which are more or less ineffective although the claws are often quite sharp and capable of scratching. It will hiss on some occasions also. Pythons, Monitor-lizards and a few other reptiles besides tortoises have the same habit of discharging an unpleasant smelling whitish substance from the anus when molested. Bush fires undoubtedly cause the death of many of these slow-moving creatures. However, in the dry season many escape fire since they aestivate through the drought weather by burying themselves in loose soil, sand, under rocks, the roots of trees or in termitaria or similar places. They are not always safe even in these situations all the same, for I have found calcined remains or skeletons on several occasions</page><page sequence="4">38 THE NYASALAND JOURNAL buried in soil after a fire had passed by, the intense heat having killed them. The smell of smoke has the effect of driving one of these tortoises nearly frantic, and they seem to have an hereditary fear of fire. I have never seen one move so fast and in such a panicky manner as a captive specimen I kept which was not far from a small bonfire when it was lighted. This animal was too far away from the fire to detect any difference in temperature, but the strong wind blew the smoke towards it. In Nyasaland the Hinged Tortoise is normally nocturnal in the lowland areas, but is more often seen abroad in daylight in highland areas. It does not like to walk about or feed on hot days, and is largely governed by temperature in its move? ments. It may walk as much as a quarter of a mile or more at night if food is difficult to come by or to gain some tempting delicacy. For a tortoise in can move with surprising quickness at times. It is often abroad in daytime in dull or wet weather. It can swim and is well supported by the air trapped in the carapace and lungs, and it gets along in the water by moving all the four limbs as though walking. The incubation period for the eggs in this country seems to be about 6 months. Numerous eggs are laid usually; I have recorded up to 19 in a clutch. The penis of the male is situated near the apex of the comparatively long tail, and, when mating, the tail is curved round so that the penis, which is normally pointing backwards, is brought round to point forwards. Only the typical race is known from Nyasaland. 2. Geochelone pardalis (Gray,) 1831. Eastern Leopard Tortoise. Kamba; Kamba Nundu. The Nyasaland race is regarded as G. p. babcocki Loveridge, 1935. This is a comparatively rare species that is apparently very local in distribution in this country. I have found in only near Port Herald and near Chikwawa in the hills to the west, and it has not been recorded elsewhere in the country to my knowledge. The Chikwawa record is a new locality record, in fact. The range in Nyasaland thus appears to be the west bank of the Shire River between Chikwawa and Port Herald, from the river to the hills forming the south-western border</page><page sequence="5">THE CHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE 39 with P.E.A. It is found chiefly in these hills. Elsewhere in Africa (Mt. Elgon) it has been recorded up to 10,000 feet and is normally found in sandy and stony, hilly country. It is known from P.E.A. between Port Herald and Dona Ana. The Leopard Tortoise is a much larger species than the Hinged Tortoise when adult, and attains a maximum length of about 2 feet (as much as 3 feet when measured over the curve of the carapace). The girth may be 40 inches or more and the weight as much as nearly 70 pounds, although this is exceptional and a normal weight would be between 20-30 pounds. The carapace is strongly domed, much more so than that of the Hinged Tortoise, and the animal does not possess a ligamentous hinge to the carapace. The Cinyanja name Kamba Nundu could be translated as 'Humped Tortoise', the name nundu referring to the hump on the back of any animal. In colour the carapace is yellow or brown with black markings that are usually radially arranged, but the whole back may be dark brown , or blackish in some specimens. The pattern is similar to that of the Hinged Tortoise. The plastron is yellowish with black blotches. There are 5 claws on the forelimb and 4 on the hindlimb. The edges of the jaws are strongly dentate. As in the Hinged Tortoise, the tail of the male is comparatively long, that of the female comparatively short. The food or this tortoise is simalar to that of the Hinged Tortoise. I have found that in captivity they will eat most fruits (paw-paws, mangoes, bananas, pumpkins, water-melons and even apples, grapes and imported figs although the latter were only nibbled); grasses (they ate the following readily: Cynodon dactylon, young shoots of Setaria palustris, Heteropogon contortus, Chloris virgata and, less readily, young shoots of Urochloa mosambicensis, the inflorescence and seeds of which they would eat also, as well as the seeds of some other grasses); cultivated legumes and leaves of sweet-potatoes, lettuce and cabbage, carrot-tops, etc.; ground-nut leaves; Opuntia dillenii; and flowers, stems and leaves of Adenium ?coetaneum. This list is by no means exhaustive and the fruits of many wild trees are eaten also. They have been recorded elsewhere in Africa as feeding on numerous other plants including</page><page sequence="6">40 THE NYASALAND JOURNAL Crassulaceae and other succulents, and Portulacaceae. Curi? ously enough, although recorded as Feeding on Staphelia spp., a captive specimen refused to eat a Staphelia sp. when offered to it. No Staphelia spp. occur in the Lower River region as far as I am aware, however, and the tortoise could not have come across any species in nature. Nevertheless two tortoises had no hesitation in nibbling apples and grapes, articles of diet even more foreign than Staphelia. Like the Hinged Tortoise, the Leopard Tortoise will gnaw bones occasionally, eat carrion and the excreta of other animals which form a supply of calcium. The Leopard Tortoise's enemies are much the same as those of the previous species. The eggs are preyed on by numerous animals including Monitor-lizards, jackals, hyaenas, dogs, egg-eating snakes, Viverrids and some Mustelids. Adults specimens are attacked by few animals in all probability, although ratels have been known to eat them and a hyaena would make a meal of any one it came across, of course. Immature specimens are killed and eaten chiefly by birds, and the Ground Hornbill, Secretary Bird, Pied Crow and others are known to feed on them. They are eaten by many Africans, and bush-fires account for some mortality. This tortoise is long-lived and in captivity has been kept for over 30 years (Flower, 1937), although under optimum conditions it probably has an even greater longevity. The Leopard Tortoise drinks regularly in captivity, although like most reptiles it is able to go for long periods without water apart from the moisture obtained from its food. When mating (there seems to be no particular season in Nyasaland) males are liable to fight in the presence of a female, butting each other and often continuing the fight until one is turned over; the victor then pursues the female while the vanquished male soon rights itself and makes off. The male may follow the female about for a long time before being able to mount her, there being several first-hand observations of this behaviour (Leakey, 1944; Archer, 1948). The male is often vocal when breeding, and makes a harsh groaning sound that carries a considerable way, sounding as though in pain.</page><page sequence="7">THE CHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE 41 Some 5-30 eggs are laid in a clutch in a circular hole from 2-10 inches in depth usually, but possibly up to 100 may be laid in several clutches by a single female. The egg is virtually round and about the size of a table-tennis ball. The shell is very brittle. In Nyasaland the eggs hatch in about 8 months, but the time varies and in colder climates may take as long as 18 months. After the eggs are laid in the hole scratched by the female, the soil is scraped back and stamped down by the parent which also bumps the earth over the eggs with its plastron by raising itself as high as possible and then relaxing and dropping its body. In order to soften hard soil, presumably, or perhaps to bind friable soil, the female will often urinate over the nest site, sometimes continuing to do so for some days (see Loveridge and Lawrence, 1957 for a more detailed account; also no. 4 below, p. 45). The young claw their way out of the egg and nest when they are ready to emerge. The shells are soft and flexible at this stage but harden quite quickly, and the young are very active as soon as they emerge. Trionychidae (Turtles). 3. Cycloderma frenatum Peters, 1854. Mud Turtle. Nkhasi; Kalibungu; Litetamera; Mbulundwe. This is the only true turtle in the country. It is essentially an aquatic animal and in Nyasaland is recorded from many places on the Lake Shore, Lake Chilwa, Lake Chiuta and the Lower River, but it undoubtedly occurs in other waters and may be found in any lake or swamp, river or stagnant pool. According to Mitchell (1959) it is commoner in the shallower parts of Lake Nyasa and is not found or is exceedingly rare in deeper waters, although it is sometimes found basking on the surface of the Lake some two or three miles out. In the Lower River this species appears to be quite common although I have been able to capture only two specimens, one in the Ruo River just above Chiromo. However, I have not tried to obtain them from fishermen but the Africans</page><page sequence="8">42 THE NY AS ALAND JOURNAL inform me that they capture them occasionally in their nets and one man told me that he had once obtained 5 or 6 in one catch although this seems most unlikely. The Mud Turtle has a carapace attaining a maximum length of about two feet, although few specimens found are more than about 18 inches in length. The total length with the head and neck fully extended may be almost 4 feet in an adult, for the head and the neck of a large specimen may measure as much as 18 inches or perhaps even more. The carapace is flattened, leathery and usually smooth (sometimes pitted), and only varies in length between the straight and over curve measurements by about an inch. It is more or less oval in shape. The colour of the carapace skin is normally a uniform dark olive in adults, while the plastron is creamy, yellowish or whitish-pink normally with darker markings. Hatchlings are paler in colour, however, and are usually pale green above often with the carapace edged with white, while the plastron is white with a few dark markings. The neck of the juvenile is distinctly longitudinally striped above by four or five dark lines; in the adult these stripes sometimes become faint and may almost disappear altogether. The head and neck may have distinct white spots in some older specimens. All four feet are webbed, and the forelimbs are paddle shaped. Three of the digits on each foot are armed with a claw each. There are distinct femoral flaps hinged on the plastron which can be closed at will when the hind limbs are withdrawn, and the flexible plastron closes also against the carapace to protect the withdrawn tail, the head and the front limbs so that the animal is completely closed at both ends. The long head and neck are drawn straight back by a sinuous vertical flexure and not bent to one side as is the case with Pelomedusa. The head has a small, fleshy proboscis with the nostrils situated at the tip of this, and the eyes are found well forward on the head. The tail is very short and does not project beyond the carapace margin. The weight is up to about 30 pounds.</page><page sequence="9">THE CHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE 43 The food consists of fresh-water animals and includes aquatic insects; small fish; young crabs; aquatic snails including Lanistes spp.; and mussels, Mutela spp. (Mutelidae) and Caelatura nyassensis (Unionidae). Naturally since they are primarily aquatic the principle enemies, apart from man, are also aquatic or semi-aquatic or marsh-loving birds. The chief of these are probably croco? diles, Monitor-lizards (Varanus niloticus), otters (Lutra maculi collis and Aonyx capensis) and possibly Tiger-fish (Hydrocyon lineatus) and the young are attacked and eaten by numerous water-birds such as storks and herons. They are sometimes parasitized by leeches. On land they are likely to be attacked and killed by much the same enemies as the tortoises. The Mud Turtle can remain out of water for a considerable time although it seldom does so except in the breeding season, or when finding its way from one stretch of water to another, a journey it undertakes normally at night and in the rains. It is very active on land and can move along at a fair pace, considerably faster than the usual speed of the tortoises. It is only in water all the same that it is in its true element, and it can swim and dive better than some fishes and its agility and activity enables it to escape many a potential predator. It is very adept also at disappearing in sand or mud at the bottom of the river, digging its way in by means of the powerful front limbs and throwing up the bottom mud over its body so that it creates its own 'smokescreen'; when this settles the turtle has disappeared from sight under the mud. Nor does it necessarily remain in the same place once embedded in the mud or sand, but may burrow for some distance under the soil on the bottom. Once hidden from view it may close itself up and remain still for half an hour or longer. It appears to prefer sandy bottomed stretches of water rather than muddy ones in my experience here and elsewhere in Africa. The Mud Turtle is enabled to remain under water for long periods, possibly even for as much as 12 hours or more, since it can to some extent breathe below the surface. It possesses greatly enlarged hyoid bones which are raised and lowered at a fast rate; these considerably extend the pharynx and pump a stream of water in and out of the mouth. Since the pharynx is highly vascular, the air suspended in the water is removed and the animal is thus largely independent of the</page><page sequence="10">44 THE NYASALAND JOURNAL atmosphere. Mitchell (1959) puts forward the interesting suggestion that the thin, highly vascular skin of the carapace and plastron?particularly the latter?also allows an exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in a similar manner to the skin of a frog. When breathing in the normal manner of an animal with lungs, it shows no more than the extreme tip of the snout above the water by virtue of the terminal nostrils and the long flexible neck. Apart from the Mud Turtle's remarkable ability for conceal? ment and its agility and, at times, stealthy movements, it has some defence also by closing itself within its shell. The plastron is flexible since it consists of small bony plates or shields joined together by connective tissue and covered by a thin skin and, as remarked already, the limbs, tail and head can be withdrawn and protected by pulling the plastron sides against those of the carapace. The Mud Turtle, unlike some of its relatives, is an inoffensive creature preferring to avoid its enemies rather than fight. It has strong jaws all the same, and would be capable of inflicting quite a severe bite if need be, and its powerful limbs and strong claws can be used to some effect when it is picked up by a human being. The female comes on land to lay its eggs like all turtles, and the eggs are laid during the rainy season, at night normally, within a few hundred yards of the water. A hole is made by the female about 6 inches in depth, preferably on a sandy beach, sometimes in the shade, sometimes in the sun. Up to about 25 eggs are laid in a clutch but it seems likely that some females, anyway, may lay more than one clutch. Each egg is about an inch and a half in diameter and completely round in shape. On Lake Nyasa, Mitchell (1959) reports an incubation period of 8-11 months and states that juveniles are common on the beach under logs and stones in January. Africans in the Lower River tell me that very young turtles are seen in the early rains in December and January, but I have seen none myself in this area where no beaches exist and the river banks are densely covered with bango reed, etc.. No races of this species are recognised.</page><page sequence="11">THE GHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE 45 Pelomedusidae (Terrapins). 4. Pelomedusa subrufa (Lacepede), 1788. Cape Terrapin. Nkhasi (sometimes). This species and the two following are similar in habits, all being semi-aquatic, and they are found in much the same localities. The Cape Terrapin has been recorded from the Lower River where it is not uncommon, and I have four records for the Shire River or on the bank of the Shire between Chiromo and Chikwawa and one for the Mwanza River. It is recorded also from Lirangwe and Chitala River (Mitchell). It almost certainly occurs in other localities, such as the Lake, but there seem to be no definite records. The Cape Terrapin has a flat, smooth carapace up to about 12 inches in length which is brown or blackish-brown in colour. The plastron is light brown. The head and neck are fairly long but no more than about a third of the length of the carapace whereas in Cycloderma the head and neck together are subequal to the carapace length. The tail is long and when extended projects beyond the edge of the carapace. The hind feet are more or less distinctly webbed and three of the toes of each hindfoot are equipped with a claw. Neither the plastron nor the carapace is hinged and thus the animal cannot close the two ends of the shell. The limbs, tail and head can be withdrawn, however, into the shell and the head is withdrawn by a sideways bend in the neck that conceals the head under the shell but leaves the neck partially exposed: the method of withdrawing the head is therefore quite different from that employed by the tortoises and Cycloderma. In the water the Cape Terrapin can swim and dive with ease and agility, although it is not as proficient as Cycloderma. It can remain submerged for long periods up to at least two hours. It spends a considerable amount of time on land in the rainy season and is sometimes discovered a long way from water. In Southern Kordofan in the Sudan I used to come across this species quite frequently on flooded roads. Like Cycloderma, it only pokes the tip of the snout above the water surface.</page><page sequence="12">46 THE NYASALAND JOURNAL The Cape Terrapin is primarily a carnivorous species and will devour most small animals it can catch, feeding particularly on those in or near its aquatic habitat. Frogs, toads and their larvae; small fishes; aquatic insects and other insects that fall in the water or are found on land but are unable to fly (such as some ground-beetles), and the larvae and pupae of insects when these can be obtained; small crabs; slugs and snails; and earthworms are amongst its normal prey. Larger but defenceless prey (once caught) may be eaten piecemeal, the terrapin tearing bits of flesh off them with its claws and jaws. Like so many other 'carnivorous' animals, the Cape Terrapin is not completely carnivorous but will eat water-weeds such as parts of the duckweed, liverwort and algal-mats and some of the vegetable parts of the sudd-rafts that are so common in the Lower Shire; Nympaea lotus and Pistia stratiotes roots are occasionaly nibbled as well as those of other plants probably. The often numerous insect fauna that is found in these floating plant communities are not only the prey of Jacana and other birds, but also of Pelomedusa and Pelusios, and it is probable that these terrapins visit these floating mats more for the insects found than to feed on the plant matter, but nevertheless they do feed to some extent on the vegetation. In captivity the Cape Terrapin will live on chopped meat (raw) and will occasionally eat fresh lettuce or cabbage leaves and probably on parts of other cultivated vegetables, although I have not attempted to feed any captive specimen on anything else of vegetable origin. It is not known if this species invariably aestivates in this country in the dry season?probably not?but when it does it buries itself in the soil, a hole in the ground or bank of a stream. It seems likely that it is only when it is in an area where the water dries up and which is a long way from any permanent water, that it aestivates. The longevity is probably about 10 years, but may be longer. The Cape Terrapin possesses glands that provide it with an obnoxious smell which offers it some protection against its enemies; the only other defences that it has are its agility and cryptic habits. Many Africans eat it, nevertheless, but</page><page sequence="13">THE CHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE 47 remove the glands before the feast. Its other enemies are the same as those of the Mud Turtle, or on land, those of the Hinged Tortoise. Like many turtles, the Cape Terrapin sometimes becomes frenetic in the early rains, rushing about on land and behaving with a furious energy: this behaviour is certainly associated with its reproduction and distribution, and during the rainy season these semi-aquatic reptiles are able to travel a consider? able way overland to fresh pools and rivers. The female lays about a dozen eggs in a clutch, sometimes more, and a shallow hole is dug to a depth of some 6-8 inches. The eggs are membraneous, oval in shape and an inch to an inch and a half in length. Once laid they are covered up again with soil in a similar manner to the oviposition behaviour of the tortoises. Again, like the Leopard Tortoise, it may urinate and defecate on the soil before digging the hole and again afterwards. It is possible that this serves the purpose of softening hard soil or binding soft soil, but it seems to be an instinctive hereditary trait, the origin of which is lost, and it is probably an anthropomorphism to suppose that the practice is necessarily designed for the purpose usually attributed to it. Only the typical race is recorded. 5. Pelusios subniger (Lacepede), 1788. Black Terrapin. Nkhasi (sometimes). This is a less common terrapin and has been recorded from a number of places in the Lower River, at Chibotela and in Lake Chilwa. It undoubtedly occurs elsewhere. In the Lower River it has been recorded from the Murchison Rapids above Chikwawa, at Nchalo, Chiromo and Port Herald so it is likely to be found anywhere in the Shire Valley. It is a small terrapin with a carapace length of a maximum of 10 inches, and is very similar in form to the Cape Terrapin. It is readily distinguished from the Cape Terrapin by the plastron which is hinged anteriorly and by the colour of the plastron; this may be uniform black or uniform yellow, or yellow but reddish towards the posterior outer edge of each shield (segment).</page><page sequence="14">48 THE NYASALAND JOURNAL Like the Cape Terrapin, the Black Terrapin bends its neck sideways in order to conceal the head, and in its habits it appears to differ little from the former species. No races are recognised. 6. Pelusios sinuatus (Smith), 1838. Serrated Terrapin. Nkhasi (sometimes). I have not seen this species in the Lower River although it was recorded by Gray from 'near the Murchison Rapids' in 1863. It has been taken, however, in recent years on the upper reaches of the Shire R. and Lake Chilwa, and at Fort Johnston, Mtimbuka near the Fort, and Monkey Bay. It seems likely that it is a Lake Nyasa species and largely confined to the Lake in Nyasaland. It is similar in size and shape to P. subniger and has an anteriorly hinged plastron like that species. As in both the other terrapins the head is concealed by bending the neck sideways. It may be distinguished readily from the other species by the serrations on the posterior margin of the carapace, and the characteristic black pattern round the edge of the plastron which is otherwise yellow, greyish or whitish in colour. In habits and behaviour and general bionomics the Serrated Terrapin probably differs little in the main from the other species, but I have not had the opportunity of studying this species. No races are recognised. KEY TO THE GHELONIA OF NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.* 1.
