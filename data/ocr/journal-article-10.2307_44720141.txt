Atkinson, Jose J. Garcia, Nicholas J. Altiero, and Roger C. Haut Michigan State University Copyright 1 997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Injury to the lower extremity during an automotive crash is a significant problem. While the introduction of safety features (i.e. seat belts, air bags) has significantly reduced fatalities, lower extremity injury now occurs more frequently, probably for a variety of reasons. Lower extremity trauma is currently based on a bone fracture criterion derived from human cadaver impact experiments. These impact experiments, conducted in the 1960's and 70's, typically used a rigid impact interface to deliver a blunt insult to the 90° flexed knee. The resulting criterion states that 10 kN is the maximum load allowed at the knee during an automotive crash when certifying new automobiles using anthropomorphic dummies. However, clinical studies suggest that subfracture loading can cause osteochondral microdamage which can progress to a chronic and debilitating joint disease. Additional studies suggest that the stiffness of the impact interface influences knee injury modalities resulting from impact loading. In the current study, a single impact at 27 J of energy with a rigid interface was delivered to one knee of isolated joint preparations of six cadavers resulting in an average peak load of 5 kN. Contralateral knees were impacted with a padded interface at an additional level of energy at approximately the same load. All rigid impact experiments resulted in some form of injury to the patella including occult microcracking and gross fracture of the patella. No injuries were detected in the knees from the padded experiments. Math modeling of the patellae showed significantly reduced tensile and shear stresses in the bone with padding. This study suggests that the current lower extremity injury criterion, based solely on load, may not be sufficiently conservative. Increasing contact area over the knee reduces stresses in the bone and prevents both gross bone fracture and bone and cartilage microdamage. Such data may be useful in future instrument panel designs and might suggest revision to the current lower extremity injury criterion. INTRODUCTION Three extensive field studies conducted in 1977 examined the frequency of injuries associated with automotive accidents [1-3]. The studies found as many as 37% of automotive accident survivors sustained injuries involving the lower extremity (foot, knee, thigh or hip). Injury typically involved gross fracture of bone and the knee accounted for approximately a third of these injuries. This suggests that approximately one in ten automotive accidents resulted in knee injury two decades ago. Knee injury typically resulted from high speed contact with the instrument panel [2,3]. It was estimated in 1977 that 900,000 knee injuries associated with motor vehicle accidents occurred per year in the United States. Severe injury to articular joints, such as those incurred to the knee during automotive accidents, are difficult to treat [4-6] and are implicated in chronic joint morbidity and pain [1,7-21]. In 1976 a federally regulated injury criterion (FMVSS 208) was adopted to address lower extremity injury. The criterion states that axial femoral loads cannot exceed 10 kN when certifying new automobiles with anthropomorphic dummies at a crash velocity of 13.4 m/s (30 mph). The criterion is based on a bone fracture threshold derived from human cadaver impact experiments [22-26]. Analysis of more recent injury incidence studies conducted in the 1990's shows that the incidence of lower extremity injury has not decreased over the past twenty years and has, in fact, increased in some analyses [5,27-30]. These results are attributed to the increased safety of automobiles following the mandated use of seat belts and the fleetwide phase-in of air bags into production vehicles from 1987-97. In 1995 it was documented that seat belts and air bags are 42% and 15% effective, respectively, in preventing fatal injuries [26,31,32]. A decrease in the incidence of fatalities associated with severe crashes has resulted in a higher incidence of non-life threatening injuries, such as those involving the lower extremity. While seat belts and air bags are effective in protecting vital organs [31] from 3697</page><page sequence="2">injurious impact with the windshield, steering wheel, etc., the lower extremity may be the sole site of unprotected contact between the occupant and the automotive interior [2,3,5,27-30,32,33]. Currently, 4,800,000 injuries are attributed to automotive accidents each year [34] and 500,000 injuries are serious enough to require hospitalization. Estimates of the current incidence rate of lower extremity injury are 30% [28], 37% [5], 50% [4] and as high as 58% [27]. This suggests between 150,000-300,000 lower extremity injuries per year require treatment. Eight per cent of the total treatment cost from motor vehicle accidents is due to the lower extremities [35]. In 1993, the overall cost associated with treating injured automotive occupants was approximately $55,000 per occurrence [27], suggesting that lower extremity injury may account for $2,200,000,000 annually. In addition to gross, acute trauma, clinical studies suggest irreversible injury may occur in the absence of bone fracture [36,37]. Acute post-traumatic pain and a subsequent disease (osteoarthrosis or osteoarthritis, known as OA) are complications commonly associated with joint trauma [1 ,7-21 ,38]. OA may account for a societal cost of $54,000,000,000 annually in both treatment costs and lost work days. OA affects cartilage and subchondral bone of articulating joints [39]. While the etiology of OA is not well understood, subfracture mechanical insult has long been associated with its development via controlled in vivo animal experiments [7,9-11,40]. These studies suggest that bone microdamage, and its subsequent healing, causes sclerosis of the underlying subchondral bone inducing abnormally high stresses in the overlying cartilage. This leads to progressive cartilage degeneration and loss of this tissue. Clinical and post-mortem studies have been conducted on the human in an effort to understand joint disease pathogenesis and progression. Shimizu et al. [41] studied biopsy tissues from the human tibial plateau and found degradation in the underlying bone preceding changes in the overlying cartilage. A recent clinical study of high energy knee injuries indicates changes in the underlying subchondral bone as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These injuries were associated with "overt cartilage loss or defect in 48% of the patients evaluated 6 months after injury"[42], "Radiographically occult injuries to the bone, otherwise referred to as occult fractures, bone bruises, or microtrabecular trauma/fracture, may account for patient pain" [43], perhaps by impeding venous drainage through extraosseous veins [20]. Additional clinical studies document a strong correlation between a history of joint trauma and the development of osteoarthritis [44,45], indeed, complaints of joint pain immediately following insult to a joint has been reported in approximately 88% of patients eventually progressing to osteoarthrosis [19]. Additionally, Johnson-Nurse and Dandy [46] (1985) document that 50% of osteoarthritic patients recall a traumatic injury to the diseased joint in years prior to the development of symptoms. Recent studies by our laboratory have shown that occult microcracks can be produced near the cartilage-bone interface following blunt subfracture insult to the 90° flexed human knee [47,48]. The microcracking is evident at approximately 70% of the load required for gross fracture of bone in the knee. These microcracks may yield the so-called "bone bruises" in MR images. Because these injuries occur below the gross fracture tolerance of bone, the current criterion used in the automotive industry may not be sufficiently conservative to protect the long term health of the joint. Two-dimensional mathematical models of the human knee suggest that these occult microcracks may be the result of excessive shear stresses [48]. Parametric studies performed on these models indicate the distributions of stress in articular cartilage and bone depend on the input boundary loads and joint geometry [6,49-51]. For example, distributing impact loads over a greater area (i.e. padded interface) might limit injury to bone and cartilage [6]. Theoretical models suggest shear stresses are reduced by more than 50% with a padded versus rigid impact interface [6,51]. While the field investigation data presented above show lower extremity injury to be a significant problem, numerous experimental studies attempting to simulate contact between the knee and instrument panel, have also been undertaken in an effort to identify injury thresholds and mechanisms. The experimental studies are advantageous over field observations since tests can be conducted in a controlled, repeatable manner with the ability to obtain detailed data. Alternately, field observations are made after the incident has taken place. Assumptions must be made as to vehicle/occupant kinematics, contact points, etc. Therefore, to quantify what is already known, a retrospective analysis was conducted of four main experimental impact studies using whole cadavers [22- 25]. A total of 68 limbs were tested. Typically, the cadaver was seated with the knee at 90° flexion and an impact missile of variable mass (10-50kg) was directed at the knee at various velocities (5-13.4 m/s). In 32 tests the impact missile was faced with a flat, rigid plate. In the remaining 36 tests, the plate was covered by pads of variable thickness and composition. The incidence of fracture to the patella, femoral condyles, femoral shaft, femoral neck and pelvis are shown in Table 1 . 3698</page><page sequence="3">Table 1 : Lower extremity bone fracture injuries by site; data taken from past experimental studies [22-25] Impact Interface # of tests Patella Femoral Femoral Shaft Femoral Pelvis Total Injuries Condyles Neck Rigid Interface 32 27 14 10 4 1 56 injuries Incidence* 84% 44% 25% 13% 3% Padded Interface 36 7 11 7 0 5 30 injuries Incidence* I 1 19% I 30% I 19% I 0% I 14% I &amp; Incidence = # of injuries/# of tests The majority of fracture injuries occur in the knee with the rigid interface in which the patella, femoral condyles or both suffered gross fracture. The localized distribution of load on the patella has been implicated in the high incidence of knee injuries with the rigid interface [6,25]. The contact between the rigid impact interface and the bony anterior surface of the patella likely resulted in a very localized distribution of the impact load. The flesh thickness over the anterior patella is approximately 4.8 mm [52], offering little protection to a rigid impact. Alternately, padding likely resulted in a distribution of the impact force over part or all of the patella and possibly the femoral condyles [6]. This resulted in a significant reduction of knee injuries. These studies suggest that the distribution of impact load over the knee is an important factor in injury prevention. The lower extremity injury criterion currently utilized in the automotive industry (FMVSS 208) is based, in part, on experimental studies using a rigid interface. This suggests that the criterion is a somewhat conservative predictor of lower extremity injury since typical instrument panels are not rigid, thus offering some degree of protection by distributing impact load over the knee. However, as mentioned above, recent field reports document that lower extremity injury persists at or above past incidence rates, probably for a variety of reasons. While increasing the amount of contact area over the anterior surface of the knee decreases the incidence of injury, the criterion is based solely on peak impact force and does not take into account how the force is distributed. Currently, it is not possible to quantify the contact area required to prevent injury at loads less than 10 kN, based on an analysis of the whole cadaver experiments cited above, due to the following: 1) While load data was measured in all of the past studies, the contact area over the knee was not measured (i.e. with pressure sensitive film, etc.). 2) Intrastudy comparisons/contrasts of specific data may not be valid due to variations in protocol (i.e. impact energy, pre-impact cadaver positioning). 3) Between-subject comparisons may not be valid due to the large variability documented in fracture load and energy with cadaver age, height and sex [25]. 4) Between-subject comparisons may not be valid due to anthropometric variations of the anterior surface of the knee (size variations of 20% in a random sample of knees) [52]. Anterior knee surface geometry is of particuar interest because the contact of the impact interface with this anatomy influences, in large part, the distribution of load over the knee. For example, scaled shape differences can lead to larger or smaller contact areas, whereas, local anatomical incongruities could lead to load distribution gradients in the area of contact. Intersubject articular joint geometrical variation may be due to a variety of effects including age, sex, height, weight and heredity [53]. In general, joint geometry probably reflects the demands placed on the joint during normal activities such as ambulation, rising from a chair, etc. Patellar geometry is a significant predictor of anterior knee pain [53] and may indicate a predisposition to early joint pathology which may influence knee joint injury mechanisms [48]. The objective of the current study is to investigate the relationship between load and contact area while addressing the concerns noted above. The goal was to investigate how different distributions of a given load would affect impact biomechanics and macro/micro injuries to the knee. Therefore, paired experiments were conducted on human cadaver knees with rigid and padded interfaces at consistent 'within subject' impact loads. Each patella was theoretically modeled to investigate whether the state of stress in the bone and cartilage correlated with injury. A geometrical measure was also made of each patella to investigate how individual joint geometry may have affected the theoretical and experimental results. Subsequent gross and histological examinations were conducted and injury to bone and cartilage were documented. METHODS AND MATERIALS Experimental Methods Impact experiments were conducted on six pairs of isolated human knee joints (65±12 years). The sample size was selected following a confidence interval analysis to determine how many subjects would be required to yield sufficient statistical power. The premortem age of the subjects was not of particular interest for the specific type of testing performed in the current study. While other studies have documented age effects in the properties of joint tissues, a previous study showed that cadaver age is not a significant 3699</page><page sequence="4">Probability of Bone Fracture vs Impact Energy Figure 1 predictor of impact biomechanics or injury (gross or microdamage) to the human knee [48]. Advanced joint pathology, however, may affect joint injury and impact biomechanics. Therefore, gross joint inspection was used to select the sample pool of test subjects. Tissues were procured by the Tissue Bank (see Acknowledgment) from donors with no prior history of joint trauma and/or evidence of advanced joint pathology (areas of denuded bone, advanced chondromalacia, etc.). Shortly after death, the patellofemoral joint was examined through a medial incision. Joint preparations were excised approximately 15 cm from the knee proper within 4 hours of death and stored at -20° C until the day Figure 2 of testing. Superficial tissues proximal to the femoral condyle were excised and the femoral shaft was cleaned with alcohol. The femur was potted in a cylindrical steel sleeve with room temperature curing epoxy, and was mounted to a rigid test frame [54]. Each specimen was maintained at a flexion angle of 90° prior to impact with a loosely knotted tether tied to the quadriceps tendon. The knot was such that minimal load was required to cause slippage, thus minimizing tensile loads in the tendon during impact. One knee from each subject was impacted once (see below for details) with a rigid interface at an impact energy of 27 J. This energy was selected following a logistical regression analysis of a previous experimental study involving twenty human cadavers [48]. The analysis suggested that 27 J of energy would provide the greatest chance of producing an occult trauma while accepting a 50% chance of gross bone fracture (Figure 1). Following the rigid interface experiment on one knee of each subject, the contralateral knee was impacted once with a padded interface (Hexcel, 1.35 MPa crush strength) at an energy which resulted in approximately the same load. A greater impact energy was required to achieve the same load as in the rigid interface experiments, due to the deformable characteristics of the padding. Pilot impact experiments were conducted on a knee analog to determine the relationship between energy and peak contact load for the rigid and padded interfaces. The knee analog was constructed from a short length of 1 0 cm x 1 0 cm wood block covered by a 6.4 mm thick rubber sheet (Figure 2). Experiments with a rigid and padded interface using a 4.8 kg mass were conducted at a range of velocities. This data was crossplotted to eliminate the influence of the knee analog and to develop a functional relationship between the padded and rigid interface. The increased impact energy required for padded interface experiments to yield the same load as rigid experiments could then be determined (Figure 3). Figure 3 The data is presented as a so-called 'energy multiplier' plotted versus the rigid interface peak impact load. While the impact energy was consistent for all rigid interface experiments, the impact load was variable for all cadavers. Therefore, following the rigid experiment for each cadaver, the increased energy required to produce the same peak load with the padded interface was determined by looking up the energy multiplier (Figure 3). The rigid impact energy (27 J) was then multiplied by this factor and the contralateral knee was impacted with the padded interface at that energy. Impact was delivered to the knees via a 4.8 kg missile accelerated to the pre-impact velocity required for each experiment. The missile was aligned on two steel guide rails and supported on four nylon blocks to minimize friction. A 7.5 x 8 cm, 6061 -T6 aluminum impact interface was mounted to the front of a load transducer (Model 3173-2k, Lebow Products, Troy, Ml, USA). The impact mass was selected based on a previous study [54]. The resonant frequency of the load cell with the impact interface attached was 1333 Hz. Pilot studies indicated that the load transducer and attached mass would not resonate during impact on the human knee. Load data was recorded continuously on a personal computer via a 16 bit A/D board (Model DAS 1600, Computer Boards, Inc., Mansfield, MA, USA). Load data were inertially compensated [48] and sampled at 20,000 Hz. The velocity of the mass was measured prior to impact on the knee using two infrared optical sensors (Part No. OR518-ND, Digi-Key Corporation, Thief River Falls, MN). These sensors were designed 3700</page><page sequence="5">with a 5 mm separation between the emitter and detector. A tab connected to the impact mass crossed the 5 mm gap interrupting the first sensor and then the second. The individual sensors were separated by 76.2 mm to eliminate cross-talk. A medium range (7-40 MPa) pressure sensitive film (Prescale, single sheet, Fuji Film, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the joint prior to each impact through medial and lateral incisions of sufficient size to allow the film to pass through. The film was encased in two sheets of polyethylene film approximately 0.05 mm thick to prevent exposure to body fluids and help reduce shear loading artifacts [55]. The strips of film were sufficiently long to pass through the patellofemoral joint and cover the anterior surface of the patella to measure the location and distribution of the contact pressure in the patellofemoral joint and at the impactor-anterior patella interface. This also minimized frictional forces between the impactor and the knee. A method for indicating regions of articular cartilage contact suitable for impact loading was also employed [56]. This method semipermanently colors the area of intraarticular contact and allows documentation of the contact area to aid in locating the contact pressure boundary condition for math modeling. The pressure sensitive film was calibrated in a servohydraulic testing machine (Model 1330, Instron, Canton, MA, USA) using a previous methodology [54]. The film showed the highest sensitivity over the range of approximately 8 to 30 MPa. Briefly, the film was encased in the polyethylene packet and loaded with a 40 ms time to peak load-controlled haversine pulse. The films were analyzed within one day using a video scanner (Model MSF-300Z, MicroTek International Incorporated, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC) at 150 dpl. . The average pressure over that length was determined using the public domain NIH image program, version 1.6 (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih- image/). The distribution of contact pressures and contact areas were determined within the patellofemoral joint. Following the mechanical test the patellar geometry was quantified using the method of Grelsamer, et al. [53], in which the so-called 'morphology ratio' is determined. The ratio is the quotient of the mid- sagittal length of the patellar bone divided by the sagittal length of the articular surface ('a' and 'b', respectively, in figure 4). The morphology ratios were used to categorize each patella Figure 4: Side view of patella into one of three categories: Type I patellae, 1.2 &lt; a/b &lt; 1.5; Type II patellae, a/b &gt; 1.5, Type III patellae, a/b &lt; 1.2. Type I patellae are typical of 94% of the population [53]. The patellae were placed in 10% buffered formalin for 10-14 days. The tissue was decalcified in 20% formic acid. Each patella was transected into three to five 2-3 mm sample blocks, processed for routine paraffin embedding, slab-cut and stained with Safranin O-Fast Green. All sections were examined in light microscopy at 12-400 power and photographed. The experimental data resulting from analysis of the load-time curve and the pressure sensitive film were tabulated and statistically analyzed. The time to peak load, contact duration, peak contact load, average anterior patella contact pressure and area, average patellofemoral contact pressure and patellofemoral contact area data from rigid interface and padded interface experiments were compared with paired t-tests (Sigmastat, p&lt;0.05). A regression analysis was conducted to determine the influence of cadaver age, sex, height, weight and patellar geometry on peak load, average anterior patella contact pressure and area and average patellofemoral contact pressure and patellofemoral contact area (Excel, p&lt;0.05). Theoretical Modeling The cartilage, trabecular and cortical bone geometry of the patellae from all rigid and padded interface experiments were digitized into a commercial CAD software (AutoCAD, version 12) (Figures 5,6). The geometry was taken from a transverse plane in the area Table 2: Material properties for math model Tissue Modulus I Poisson Reference (MPa) Ratio Cartilage 20 0.49 Repo/ Atkinson Cortical/ Sub- 3750 0.3 Mente chondral Bone Trabecular 300 0.3 Townsend Bone I ^ I of highest patellofemoral contact pressure [48]. Twelve 2-D mathematical models (ANSYS, version 5.3) were developed to analyze each patella along that plane. The patella was meshed with 8 node elements and elastic isotropic behavior was assumed for the analysis with the material properties in Table 2. The assumption of elastic behavior is based on the work of Eberhardt, et al. Cartilage and, to a lesser extent bone, are commonly considered viscoleastic and are typically modeled with a rate dependent, biphasic analysis [57,58]. However, impact loading (&lt;200ms) results in negligible differences between the linear elastic and biphasic analyses. The model was run assuming static loading since stress wave transmission through articular joints causes little deviation from the quasistatic stress state [59,60]. The patellofemoral pressure distribution from the subfracture impact experiment was discretized and applied as a compressive elemental pressure to the retro-patellar surface of the model. The pressure 3701</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5: Rigid interface model distribution was located by the intraarticular contact method [56]. A one pixel slice of the pressure film image, consistent with the 2-D model, was discretized into 1 mm lengths. The average pressure over that length was determined using the public domain NIH image program, version 1.6 (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). The resulting pressure distribution was then applied to the posterior surface of the patella. The anterior surface of the patella was fixed in the area of contact with the impactor. Figure 6: Padded interface model Three areas were investigated: the cartilage surface, the subchondral bone, and the trabecular bone. The maximum principal stress, maximum shear stress and their respective locations were tabulated. The stresses from the rigid and padded experiments were compared with a paired t-test (Sigmastat, p&lt;0.05). A regression analysis was conducted to determine the influence of cadaver age, sex, height, weight and patella geometry on the maximum stresses predicted by the model (Excel, p&lt;0.05).

The time to peak load (loading rate) and contact duration (pulse) for rigid experiments were 4.14+0.45 ms and 11.33±3.0 ms, respectively. These data were significantly less than padded experiments which had a time to peak load of 7.01 ±1 .54 ms and a contact duration of 1 7.03±3.9 ms. A typical load time curve (H34) (Figure 7) shows similar peak loads with different loading rates and contact durations.

While two patellar fractures were full thickness through the patella (H33, H36), the fracture in the remaining specimen (H32) was partial thickness and emanated from the posterior surface. Analysis of the histological sections from all rigid interface experiments revealed occult microcracking in four of six specimens (H31 , H32, H35, H36). No gross bone fracture or microdamage was detected in padded experiments. Categorization of the patellae by morphology ratio (Table 4) revealed that five of six were of Type I and one was of Type II (H31). Therefore, data from H31 was therefore not included in regression analyses including the morphology ratio. Regression analyses of biomechanical impact data (Table 3) against cadaver, age, sex, height, and weight were not statistically significant. Regression analyses of the data against patella morphology ratio revealed a significant influence of decreasing peak contact force with an increasing morphology ratio (Figure 13). In addition, the three fracture specimens (H32, H33, H36) exhibited a significantly (p&lt;0.05, unpaired t-test) higher morphology ratio (1.35±0.03) than specimens which did not fracture (H34, H35: morphology ratio=1.268±0.02). Theoretical Results Stresses in the cartilage and trabecular bone were not statistically different with rigid or padded Fig 14: RigicP Interface Maximum Principal Stress Figure 15: Padded Interface Maximum Shear Stress interfaces. In the subchondral bone for both padded and rigid interface experiments, the minimum principal stress field was compressive and minimal compared to the maximum shear stress and maximum principal stress, which was tensile. The maximum principal stress was tensile. Maximum principal ('Normal') and shearing stresses occurred in the subchondral bone and were significantly reduced with padding (Table 5).

Due to the low compressive stress field, the distribution of maximum tensile and shearing stresses appeared to be consistent in each model of rigid interface experiments. Because the average maximum tensile and shear stresses were both near the failure stresses (shear, ay=68 MPa; tension, ay=133 MPa, [61]), it was not clear if injury was related to tensile or shearing stresses. Padding supported the entire anterior surface of the patella, eliminating global bending and reducing local bending of the subchondral plate. This resulted in an 80% decrease in the normal stress and a 70% decrease Trabecular bone Subchondral^plateaļj ^ I ^X-TTT&gt;¿ani'age Local bending of ' 1 J Figure 17: Patello- the subchondral 'l ^ | J/ femoral contact plate ^ and local bending in the maximum shear stress (Table 5, Figure 15). With padding the magnitude of these stresses was significantly reduced and more nearly approximated the magnitude of the minimum principal stress. Therefore, the distribution of maximum tensile and shearing stresses was different for each padded interface experiment. DISCUSSION The specific aims of the current study were to experimentally and theoretically investigate the influence of padding on the impact response of the human knee. Padding was experimentally and theoretically shown to prevent gross bone fracture and occult microdamage and to limit normal and shearing stresses in the subchondral bone plate of the patella. Paired impact experiments were conducted with rigid and padded interfaces to limit test variability. Both knees from a given cadaver were impacted at approximately the same impact load. While the padding better reflects more realistic impact scenarios (i.e. knee impacting the instrument panel), it also served to significantly change the boundary conditions at a given impact load. The rigid impact interface only contacted a small portion of the central anterior patella. Independent, outboard reactions from the medial and lateral femoral condyles resulted in approximately three point global bending of the patella. This may explain the elevated stresses in the subchondral plate for rigid interface experiments. Alternately, padding provided greater support across the entire anterior surface of the patella resulting in less bending and drastically reduced stresses in the subchondral bone. This may help explain the genesis of microcracking in the subchondral bone. Hayashi and coworkers [6] also conducted impact experiments on the 90° flexed knee using different impact interfaces. In that study, a rigid interface and a variety of Hexcel interfaces were used to conduct several experiments with each interface at a fixed impact energy. A direct comparison to the current study may not be possible because in a majority of the experiments the same interface was used on both limbs of the test subjects. In general, however, Hayashi, et al., showed similar results to the current study whereby padding can prevent transverse patellar fractures. In the current study, normal and shearing stresses in the cartilage and trabecular bone were not different between rigid and padded interface experiments, however, the subchondral bone state of stress was significantly reduced with padding. Rigid interface experiments resulted in gross bone fracture in two specimens and occult microcracking in the subchondral bone was detected in three specimens. No gross fracture of bone or occult microdamage was detected in contralateral padded experiments. Further, because the impact loads were not different in paired experiments, and the state of stress in the cartilage and trabecular bone were consistent, these data may suggest that gross fracture of bone initiates in the subchondral plate. This assumes that patellar fracture initiates near the retropatellar surface. Viano and Stalnaker [22] impacted whole, human cadavers and documented patella fractures which appeared to emanate from the posterior surface. This is supported by the results of our math model which predicts high stresses, both gobally and locally, in the subchondral bone on the posterior surface. The patella has been documented to predominantly fracture transversely in both past investigations [6,23-25,47,48,54] and in the current study. This is suggestive of a tensile failure in which the tension is directed proximal-distal. Such tensile stresses 3705</page><page sequence="10">are predicted in a stress analysis of the whole patella conducted by Minns and coworkers [62]. The model also predicts high shear stresses near the bone cartilage interface as seen in the current study. These results suggest the subchondral bone may be acting like a shell subjected to an externally applied compressive traction through contact with the femur. Because the patellofemoral contact area is much wider medial-lateral than in the transverse proximal-distal direction, the very stiff subchondral bone is essentially subjected to a narrow medial to lateral loading in the middle of the patella. The model used in the current study may be somewhat limited because the model geometry is taken from a transverse plane and the model is analyzed with the assumption of plane strain. Even though a consistent flexion angle and impact energy were used with all rigid impact interface experiments, a range of peak contact loads and injuries were documented in the current study. These differences may be related to subject-to-subject variability's in the strength of the bone and cartilage, the relative size of the knees and the relative position of the patella to the femoral condyles during the impact event. Because the premortem state of the subjects can involve extended illnesses, long periods of bedrest may be expected to lead to some level of tissue atrophy. As such, the peak loads may be a somewhat conservative measure of the current driving population [22]. While admittedly unlikely, if a consistent knee stiffness was true for all subjects, the size of the knee may then be expected to result in peak loads which scale with the size of the knee. Even with the same knee stiffness and size, more subtle joint geometry differences may affect joint impact response. Hence, the geometry of the patellae in the current study was quantified with the so- called 'morphology ratio' in effort to determine if impact biomechanics and the state of stress predicted by the math model would vary with patella geometry in a random sample of six human subjects. The morphology ratio is easily found as the ratio of two linear dimensions of patella bone and cartilage. While other investigators have used more complex methods (i.e. topographical maps, stereophotogrammetry) [63-68] to quantify joint geometry, the morphology ratio was sufficiently fine to detect differences in peak load and the incidence of gross bone fracture. Alternately, gross test subject parameters (i.e. height, weight, sex, age) did not significantly correlate with impact biomechanics in the current study or in past investigations [25,48]. While considering which independent variables might correlate best with impact biomechanics and injury, it is interesting to note the predictive power of the logistical regression used in the current study. For isolated, 90° flexed human knee impact experiments at 27J of energy, the regression predicted a high chance of occult microcracking while accepting a 50% chance of gross bone fracture. Occult microcracking was observed in four of six specimens (67%) and gross bone fracture in three of six (50%) specimens. Past in vivo studies by our group have developed an experimental rabbit model of post- traumatic osteoarthrosis [50,51,69-73]. Subfracture impacts were delivered at two levels. 'Low' severity impacts did not progress to osteoarthrosis, while 'high' severity resulted in higher tissue stresses and did progress to a chronic joint disease. Theoretical models of these experiments help to define safe and harmful levels of joint tissue stress leading to chronic problems (Table 6). While these data only represent two levels, it Table 6: Stresses from low and high severity impact Tissue Impact Max Shear Max Norm Severity Stress Stress (MPa) (MPa) Cartilage Low 6J) 6.3 Cartilage High 1Z9 16.1 SC Bone Low 16.9 12.6 SC Bone I High I 41.8 I 28.9 may be assumed that the incipient state of stress necessary for pathogenesis of a joint disease may lie somewhere between the low and high severity impact stresses. In the current study, shear and normal stresses in the subchondral plate from rigid interface experiments (Table 7) were approximately 30% and Table 7: Maximum stresses from current study. Tissue Max Shear Max Norm Stress Stress (MPa) (MPa) Rigid Padded Rigid Padded Cartilage 6.5 57 6;9 2.0 SC Bone I 54.8 I 25.2 I 94.3 I 25.2 300%, respectively, greater than the stresses shown to cause disease in the rabbit. While padding significantly limited these stresses, they were still not reduced to safe (i.e. 'low' severity) levels established in our rabbit model. This suggests a more optimized padding system might be utilized to further reduce these stresses to 'safe' levels. This might be accomplished by allowing greater intrusion into the padding system and making contact with the femoral condyles. The results of the current study suggest the importance of load distribution over the knee during impact which may have implications for future instrument panel designs and the current lower extremity criterion. Two instrument panel design factors appear to be important for occupant injury prevention: 1) the stiffness of the instrument panel should be optimized to distribute the load over the knee (and possibly the femoral condyles) to sufficiently reduce stress levels to prevent acute gross (i.e. bone fracture, ligamentous injury) and micro- injuries (occult microcracking) and chronic joint pain and morbidity (post-traumatic osteoarthrosis [70]), 2) local incongruities (i.e. plastic heater vents) should be located in areas where knee-instrument panel contact is unlikely [36]. In an effort to validate the above suggestions, quantitative field studies of instrument panel designs and associated lower extremity injury frequency are needed to identify design features which 3706</page><page sequence="11">aid occupant safety. Experimental methods of evaluating instrument panels may also prove helpful in making additional, more controlled comparisons. In 1969, Wilson [74] developed a self-contained impact apparatus which could be mounted in a vehicle and simulate knee impact into the instrument panel. A hemispherical knee analog mounted on a pendulum impactor head was directed at the instrument panel at variable velocities. A similar method might prove useful in future studies. The current lower extremity criterion used by the automotive industry is based solely on peak impact load and does not take into account how the load is distributed over the knee. The theoretical and experimental data from the current study suggest that bone and cartilage failures are related to the state of stress in the tissue and not solely the magnitude of the impact load on the knee. While it may be difficult to measure stresses in bone and cartilage in simulated accidents using anthropomorphic dummies, a more indirect approach may prove useful. From the current study it appears that anterior patellar contact area relates to the damaging stresses in the subchondral plate. By instrumenting dummy knees with a transducer to measure contact area (i.e. pressure sensitive film), peak forces on the knee may be indirectly correlated to tissue stresses. This data could be used to predict the acute (i.e. gross and occult fracture of bone) and chronic (i.e. OA) response of the typical knee joint to impact loading. Future studies will be needed to develop a better understanding of the relationship between contact area, load and tissue stresses.
