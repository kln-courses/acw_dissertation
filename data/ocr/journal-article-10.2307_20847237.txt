<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS Ahmad Hasan In Islamic jurisprudence, qiyas was generally employed in legal reasoning in the second century of the Hijrah, as it was already used in philology and grammar. Its rules were for mulated by the jurists in this period and it developed as an important legal doctrine. It was recognized as a fourth source of law along with the other three sources. By and by people began to depend on it extensively. Ultimately, it overarched the Qur'an and the Sunnah.1 There were serious differences among the exponents of qiyas about its rules and this aroused suspicions about its validity. The jurists had no solid foundation to prove its sanctity like that of the prophetic traditions. It was indeed a developed form of ra'y (opinion) used in a systematic manner. The extreme formalism and frequent use of qiyas in law made many people averse to this principle. There was a wide spread disagreement among the jurists, especially among the Iraqis, on account of the use of ra'y and qiyas. The opponents of Qiyas exploited this situation and portrayed it in a contem ptuous manner. The trenchant criticism of Ibn al-Miuqaffa' and al-Sh'abi are justifiable in view of the increasing disagree ment. The moderate legal schools began to lay great emphasis on acquiring knowledge directly from the Quran and the Sunnah, and acting upon their teaching. Consequently they started to warn the people against the dangers of the use of ra'y and qiyas with a view to obey the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and to protect the community from widespread disagreement.</page><page sequence="2">46 AHMAD HASAN Al-Bukharl devoted a whole chapter to the use of ra'y and qiyas Another contributory factor was the encouragement given by the 'Abbasids to the exponents of ra'y by appointing Abu Yusuf and others to the post of judges in the government. This also set in a strong reaction against Qiyas. In this milieu of contempt towards ra'y and qiyas there appeared on the scene Dawud b. Khalaf, the eponym of Ahl al-Zahir. He argued strictly on the basis of the Quran and the Sunnah vis-a-vis ra'y and qiyas. He depended mostly on the literal meaning of the texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. He thus founded the Zahiri school which interpreted the law literally. The Zahiris went to the other extreme. They did not care for the context, situation, implication and reason under lying the law. Their reasoning centred around the obvious literal meaning of the text. Moreover, they, sought to answer the questions not covered by the text by their far-fetched inter pretation. This polarisation between the Ahl - al - Zahir and Ahl al-ra'y was also an important factor for the condemna tion of qiyas. The Zahiris were also opposed to conformity (taqlid). Hence orthodoxy did not recognise the Zahiris as the fifth legal school. We find that the Shafi'i jurists do not consider them competent for ijtihad and neglected their disagree ment.4 But some scholars like al-Shawkani supported them. It is important to note that both the exponents and opponents of qiyas argue from the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Hence it is difficult to decide who is in the right. Qiyas, being a speculative matter, has ever been open to question. No one was satisfied with the arguments for and against it. There are various viewpoints about its validity which are enumerated below :</page><page sequence="3">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 47 1. It is agreed that qiy4s is an authority (fcujjah) in worldly affairs, such as medicine, food, etc. 2. It is also agreed that the rules derived by the Prophet on the basis of qiyas are authoritative. 3. It is also established by the consensus of opinion of the Companions, Successors, jurists (fuqaha)' and theologians (mutakallimln) that analogy in legal matters (qiyas shar'l) is a valid source of law. 4. The Hashawiyah reject both the rational Caqll) and legal fshar'i) qiyas. 5. The Hanablis reject rational Caqll) qiyas and recognise the legal one. 6. The followers of Dawud al-Isfahani (Dawudis) reject legal qiyas and recognise the rational one. 7. The Rawafid (i.e. the Shi'ah), Ibadiyah, Azariqah and a group of Najdat from the Khawarij, al-Na??am, and a group of the Mu'tazilah of Baghdad, like Yahya al-Iskafi, ja'far b. Mubashshir, and Ja'far b. Harb reject legal qiyas. They maintain that it is logically impossible for the lawgiver to command the use of qiyas. 8. Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i (d. 321. A.H.) rejects legal qiyas except the one used by the lawgiver as a similitude in clear words like verse 6 : 59. 9. Al-Qashani (d. 311 A.H.) and al-Nahrawani fd. 390 A.H.) reject juridical qiyas except the one which is used in the sense of the original case (asl). For instance, a female slave can be covered by the rules of law about a male slave by analogy.5 They allow qiyas on two conditions : first, in case the cause Cittah) is mentioned in the text explicitly or implicitly ; second, the analogy is used between the two degrees of the same thing.</page><page sequence="4">48 AHMAD HASAN For example, prohibition of beating the parents on the analogy of saying Fie to them. 10. Dawud al-?ahiri and Ibn Hazm reject both the juristic and logical qiyas even though the legal cause is mentioned explicitly in the text. 11. Al-Qaffal and Abu'l-Husayn al-Ba?ri hold the View that qiyas is an authority by reason Caqlan) and not by the Qur'an and the Sunnah. They only confirm its authority which is origi nally established on the basis of reason.6 12. Abu'l-Husayn al-Ba?n, Ahmad b. Hanbal and a group of jurists hold that if the legal cause is mentioned in the text, this implies the command for qiyas. It applies to both commands and prohibitions. This view is sometimes attribu ted to al-Nazzam too. 13. Abu cAbd Allah al-Ba?ri holds that if the legal cause is mentioned in the Text of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, it will not be taken as a basis for qiyas. But if the legal cause is mentioned in a prohibition, it will be considered a basis for qiyas. For instance, if anyone says, "Give him alms for his poverty", this cannot be extended to others. But if one says "Wine is prohibited for its intoxication" this will be applicable to all intoxicants.7 Al-Ghazali has reduced divergences in qiyas to three categories : (1) Qiyas is rationally impossible. (2) Qiyas is rationally necessary . (3) Qiyas is legally prohibited. Al-Ghazali thinks that the view held by all the Compan ions, jurists and theologians in general is that the Shap'ah has ordained (ta'abbud) the use of qiyas.8</page><page sequence="5">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 49 We begin with the arguments of the opponents based on the Qur'&amp;n to refute qiyas. They have put forward a large num ber of the verses, but we shall make a selection of them : 44 We have not neglected anything in the Book," (6:38) 44 And we have revealed the Book to these explaining all things, and a guidance and mercy and good news for those who submit." (16 : 80) They contend that these verses clearly indicate that the Qur'an contains an explanation and elucidation of all legal prescriptions. It does not explain all things, but only those things which relate to law. Things which are not legal have been left in their original state, neither legal nor illegal. Al-Ghazall replies that the Qur'an does not discuss the share of inheritance of grandfather, brothers, increase {'awl) in the shares of inheritance, option for separation, and a woman to whom one says : 44You are unalwful for me." The Companions were agreed on searching for laws about these questions. The Quran supports qiyas by introducing the princi ple of taking lesson (i4tibar) from a preceding event or by justifis ing the Sunnah and ijma4. It is already known that qiyas is valid on the basis of the Sunnah and ijma4. Besides, the opponents consider qiyas illegal but there is no indication about its illegality in the Qur'an. 2. 44And that thou shouldst judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and follow not their low desires." (5 : 49) 3. 44 Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord". (1 : 3) 4. 4 4 And whoever judges not by what Allah has revealed, those are the transgressors". (5 : 47)</page><page sequence="6">50 AHMAD HASAN The opponents argue that these verses show that judge ment in legal cases should be based on revealed prescriptions. But qiyas is a judgement no based on revelation. To this al Ghazali replies that qiyas is already supported by the Sunnah and ijma'and also justified by the Qur'an by implication. If a man decides a case on the basis of the idea (ma'na) derived from the revealed law, he in fact decides it on the basis of the revealed law. Further, these verses have been addressed to the Prophet who used to receive revelation from God. But revelation did no come down to others. Therefore, there is no analogy between the Prophet and other Muslims in respect of revelation. Hence some scholars hold that independent reasoning (ijtihad) was not permissible for the Prophet so that he might not fall into confusion. Moreover, he could preach Islam by revelation, but other Muslims could not do this. He therefore could give his judgement in all cases only on the basis of revelation. 5. " He (Satan) enjoins on you only evil and indecncy and that you speak against Allah what you know not'' (2 : 169) 6. "And follow not that of which thou has no know ledge" (17 : 36) 7. "And surely conjecture avails naught against truth" (53:28) 8. " For surely suspicion in some cases is sin." (49 : 12) They contend that these verses indicate that the use of conjecture in law is forbidden. Conjecture does not lead to truth. Al-Ghazali retrorts that a man first imagines and after imagination he gains certain knowledge, not probable one. For instance, the presumption of a judge about the truthworthiness of witnesses, ones speculation about the direction of the Ka'bah for prayer, one's imagination about the equal compensation for</page><page sequence="7">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 51 a game hunted by a pilgrim, and one's determination of legal cause ('illah) of a legal injunction, and all such speculations and probable judgements amount to certain knowledge. The verses adduced by the opponents refer to the conjecture of the unbelivers against the conclusive and definite evidences. Al Ghazall remarks that the opponents themselves do exercise conjecture and imagination to refute qiyas. This shows that they are not sure about its falsity. 9. "And certainly the devils inspire their friends to contend with you." (6 : 121) The opponents argue on the basis of this verse that people contend with each other on the basis of qiyas. But contention is forbidden. Al-Ghazall replies that the opponents of qiyas themselves resort to contention in order to nullify qiyas. This verse refers to false contention, and qiyas is not a false contention. He says that this verse applies to the opponents themselves. The verse refutes the contention and analogical reasoning of the unbelievers. About the unlawful ness of dead meat they used to say : You eat what we kill (slaughter) but you do not eat what God kills". Thus they draw an analogy between a carrion and slaughtered animal. Similarly, they drew an analogy between usury and trade. God refuted their contention that trade is just like usury.9 10. ". then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to Allah and the Apostle, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day." (4 : 59) They argue that this verse shows that a disputed point should be referred to God and the Prophet, i.e. the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Instead, the exponents of qiy4s refer it to individual opinion. Al-Ghazall replies that the exponents do not refer to individual opinion but to the legal causes Cii'al) derived</page><page sequence="8">52 AHMAD HASAN from the texts of the traditions of the Prophet. Qiyas means to understand the meaning of the texts by discovering the legal cause of the injunction and by eliminating the irrelevant causes of the injunction. The opponents refute qiyas without any reference to the text or the traditions of the Prophet or to the meaning derived from it.10 11. " Is it not enough for them that we have revealed to thee the Book which is recited to them ?" (29 :51) By presenting this verse and verses 6 : 59, and 16 : 89 the opponents of qiyas contend that rules of law about all things exist in the Qur'an. They can be known by implication, signi fication and import of the text. Sometimes they have been expressed clearly in the text. If the rules of law are not found in the Qur'an in any of these forms, the thing will be deemed permissible unless prohibition of it exists there. This principle is corroborated by the Quranic verse, " Say, I found not in that which is revealed to me aught forbidden for an eater to eat thereof.11 " He it is who created for you all that is in the earth.12 The principal object of the Qur'anic pronouncements is to achieve salvation in the next world but how can we know the benefit of the next world by exercising individual opinion? Opinion can enable us to know the immediate benefits of this world whose genus is known by sensory perception. 12. " O you who believe be not forward in the presence of Allah and His Messenger, and keep your duty to Allah. (49:1) They contend that the exercise of opinion amounts to in tervening in the commands of God and His Prophet. It is the giving of judgement against revelation, which is strictly prohibited by the Qur'anic verses 5 : 44, 45, 47. The. method of deciding cases by the exercise of opinion and employment of conjecture in legal affairs has no relation to the divine revela</page><page sequence="9">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 53 tion. Revelation means " the divine Book and the Sunnah of the Prophet." It is well known that the Prophet spoke about religious affairs on the basis of his own opinion. Whatever he said was based on revelation, as the Qur'an says, "Nor does he speak out of desire. It is naught but revelation that is re vealed."*3 13. " And utter not for what your tongues describe, the he : This is lawful and this unlawful." (16:116) The opponents of qiyas contend that a decision made on the basis of individual opinion amounts to forging a lie against God by saying : "This is lawful and this is unlawful." It is only God or the Prophet who can say that a thing is lawful or unlawful. Others have no right to say so. Thus a decision made by abitrary opinion has been condemned in this verse. These contentions have been refuted by al-Sarakhsi and others. We need not repeat them here.14 The following traditions are offered by the opponents to refute the validity of qiyas. " This community will follow the Book for a short period of time, the Sunnah a short period of time, and then they will follow qiyas (conjecture) for a short time. When they do so, they will stray." Al-Ghazali replies that this tradition refers to the exercise of opinion vis-a-vis a textual injunction when it contradicts the text. This is corroborated by another tradition of the Prophet which says : My community will be divided into more than seventy sects. The most perverted of them will be those who exercise analogy in legal matters on the basis of their Opinion in such, a manner that they make what is lawful unlaw ful and what is unlawful lawful.15</page><page sequence="10">54 AHMAD HASAN 2. The children of Israel continued to follow the right path until the children of captives became abundant among them. They drew an analogy between non existent and existent things. Therefore, they them selves strayed and led others astray." 3. "He who interprets the Qur'an on the basis of his opinion should make his abode in hell." In addition, they adduce the statements of 'Umar, Ibn Mas'ud and other Companions in condemnation of the exercise of opinion. To this al-Sarakhsi gives the same reply as given by al-Ghazali. Moreover, al-Sarakhsi remarks that there may be a difference of opinion in the interpretation of a Qur'anic verse, such as verse 4:11 where Ibn 'Abbas and Zayd b. Thabit differ on the share of mother in the presence of parents. Ibn 'Abbas holds that she will get the whole property while Zayd b. Thabit thinks that she will get 1/3 of the amount. Although they have divergent views, they are supposed to have followed the text of the Qur'an. The opponents also challenge the validity of qiyas on the basis of human reason. We find lengthy and complicated discussions on this subject. We shall therefore touch only upon important points. Q. It would be most fitting for the Muslims if the lawgiver expressed clearly all speculative questions. He could do it very well. But why did he not do it? A. He who prescribes what is merely fitting for them does not prescribe what is most fitting. Moreover, God knew that if He had expressed all obligations clearly to His servants, they would have disobeyed Him. But if some obli gations were left to their opinion, they would have had the option to follow their own reasoning and conjectures. Making a decision on the basis of the statements of two witnesses, determining the</page><page sequence="11">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 55 direction of the ka'bah, and making fungible article as a substitute for another, and determining the provision sufficient for maintenance, and compensation for an offence, and similarother examples illustrate the legitimacy of exercising speculation and conjecture in legal reasoning. Q. Qiyas is based on causality, but the causes of the injunc tions of the Shari'ah do not make the rules of law obligatory on the people. How is then causation in law valid? Further, it may be objected that a thing which is a cause for illegality may be a cause for legality. A. The cause of a legal rule is a sign of the rule prescri bed for it. It is possible that the lawgiver could have prescribed intoxication as a sign of illegality of wine by saying : "Follow this sign and avoid all intoxications." Likewise, he could also have prescribed it as a sign of legality by saying : If anyone thinks that it is a sign of legality (of drinking) I have made all intoxications lawful for him. The jurists differ among them selves on this point, and all of them are right. Q. The divine commandment is a message which can be known only by communication from God. When God has not informed us about the law concerning the exchange of raisins, how can we say that He has prohibited it for only six commodi ties which have been mentioned in the traditions of the Prophet? A. When God has commanded us to exercise qiyas and forbade usury in the exchange of wheat for wheat with un equal weight on account of its edibility, it means that He has commanded us to use qiyas in all other edibles. The injunc tions for the use of qiyas imply that he has informed us about the rule for the exchange of raisins. It should be noted that we do not validate qiyas unless an evidence for its validity is established . Qiyas is therefore a command established by</page><page sequence="12">56 AHMAD HASAN communication from God. But this command is not found in any clear text. It is implied from the consensus of the Compa nions who themselves exercised qiyas. They understood this idea (ma'na) from the words and signs of the lawgiver, but they did not convey it to use directly. Q. If there is a doubt about the suckling of a child by ten wpmen, it is not permissible to single out one woman as the mother, even if signs are found, for there is a possibility of error. How is it permissible to make an effort (rjtihad) with the possibility of error. But this objection does not apply to an effort made for seeking the direction of pray er (qiblah), to deter mine the probity of a witness for giving a judgement, for deter mining the qualifications of the manager of religious endow ments (awqaf) for two reasons : first, this relates to the valua tion of the conduct of persons and entities which are numerous and they cannot be defined on the basis of any text; secondly error in such oases is not taken into consideration, for the judges have been commanded to decide them on the basis of their presumptions (zunun) and not by the truthfulness of witness. There is of course no escape from this objeotion, One may get rid of it by recognizing the principle that every mujtahid is in the right despite his opinion being at variance with the text, so error is not possible in his case. But this objeotion applies to the one who believfes that only one point of view is right, and others are wrong. As for the doubt in the case of the suckling of a man by ten women who are marriageable, it should be noted that the possibility of error is not the only bar to marriage. It is already established that if there is any doubt about the suckl ing of a man by a woman, his marriage with her is lawful, even if afterwards it is proved that she is his mother. The Shari'ah has permitted Muslims to marry a woman about whom it is known with certainty that she is marriageable and not</page><page sequence="13">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 57 related to him within the prohibited degrees of consanguity (ajnabiyah). It enunciated a principle that certainty (yaqln) cannot be rejected by an accidental doubt. The exponents of qiyas justify it on the basis of the practice and approval of the Companions. This is their stock argument in favour of qiyas. The opponents have vehemently refuted it by their rational arguments. We analyse presently their argument and al-Ghazali's reply to them. Q. If the Companions adhered to the practice which they were ordered to follow, and did not involve themselves in the exercise of opinion and analogy, there would have been no chaos, disagreement and bloodshed. But they departed from legal obligations, exercised their choice, and deliberately believed in the validity of decisions made on personal opinion. This criticism is attributed to al-Nazzam. The Sh'iah also remark that the early Muslim fell a prey to disagreement by their disobedience to the infallible imam who had an exhaustive knowledge of divine commands. Al-Ghazali replies : This sort of objection is raised by those who do not believe in the validity of the exercise of opinion. But it is refuted by the tradition, "My community will not agree on an error." The Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet are full of praise of the Companions. How can this criticism of the Companions be taken into serious consideration ? Q. Reports indicate that some Companions exercised individual opinion and others kept silent. Those who exercised personal opinion were a small group. The majority of the Companions themselves are. reported to. have condemned the exercise of opinion in legal matters.</page><page sequence="14">58 AHMAD HASAN Al-Ghazall answers : it is definitely established by tawatur (constants) that the Companions exercised ijtihad on the basis of their opinion in a number of cases, such as the share of grandfather and brothers in the inheritance, appointment of a ruler (imam) by the general ba'yah (oath of allegiance) compila tion of the Quran and the nomination of 'Umar by Abu Bakr as a Caliph. The reports which say that they never exercised ijtihad are solitary and unreliable. Therefore the reports established by tawatur entail necessity which cannot be rejected. Secondly, suppose the reports about their condemnation of the use of opinion are sound. The opinion condemned in these reports will be construed as that which conflicts with a clear text, or which shows the ignorance of someone who is not competent for ijtihad, or where an opinion has been improper or irregular (fasid) and arbitrary is not supported by any authority (asl), or where a law has been enacted which has no precedent in the past. It is important to note that we our selves do not validate various types of ra'y and qiyas while the opponents reject them in toto. For instance, we reject the reasoning of the Zahiris that the fundamental laws (u?ul) cannot be established by qiyas (analogy) and zann (conjecture), likewise the subsidiary laws Cfuru') cannot be established by them. They contend that if the cause Cillah) were valid in the Shari'ah, it would be like the logical cause ('illah 'Aqliyah). They drew an analogy between the two things which are not similar to each other 'illah 'Aqliyah. We a*so reject such a type of qiyas. Q. The exponents of qiyas justify it by silent ijmV upon the validity of this principle. They contend that if qiyas were false, the Companions would surety express their dis approval of it. But this contention is not correct, for they might have kept silent by way of courtesy (mujamalah) compromise</page><page sequence="15">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 59 (musalaliah) for fear of the spread of schism and disturbance as a result of disagreement. Or they might not have expressed the evidence (dalU) on account of its obscurity (khafa'), for the iuridioal questions are decisive (qat'l). But the later jurists differed among themselves on the form of imperative (sighat al-amr), generality Cumum), import (mafhum), the principle of status quo (istishab al-hal), actions of the Prophet (afal-nabi), on the ground of solitary tradition (asl khabar a?-wahid), of analogy (asl al-qiyas) and of consensus (asl al-ijma'). For these questions they presumably had decisive avidenoes (adillah qati'ah) negatively and thus called those who differed from them sinners and evildoers. The Companions and the Successors never had done so. How can you explain this? A. Al-Ghazali replies ; it is inconceivable that the Companions kept silent on a certain questions by way of courtesy and compromise, and to avoid schism and disturbance. They differed among themselves on many questions, controverted and argued with each other, but never kept silent on a certain question by way of courtesy. They did not generally criticise (inkar) each other in their ordinary discussions over many questions. If they really considered any opinion highly extreme, they would, of course, call the upholder of the opinion sinner and evildoers, as they had done in the case of the Khawarij, Rawafid, and Qadariyah. It is also inconceivable that they kept silent on account of the obscurity of an evidence. Suppose a man says to another that he is neither a lawgiver nor permitted for law-making by the lawgiver, why does he then make laws by his own opinion. This argument is not so obscure that it in may not be itelligible to reason. It is, of course, true that he uses qiyas without permission and legislates by his own opinion. If the users, of qiyas had no knowledge about the permission of using qiyas, they would have criticised those who tried to rival</page><page sequence="16">60 AHMAD HASAN the Prophet in legislation. As for the principles of jurisprudence, there had never been disagreement on the validity of analogy, solitary tradition and consensus. Rather, they agreed upon these principles and we argred from their agreement. As to the other juristic principles like generality, import of a word, and form of imperative, they never had theoritical discussions about them like the later jurists. It is however certain that if they had known a decisive evidence, they would ha^e surely expressed it to others and criticised the opponents. Q. The exponents of qiyas, contend that the Companions reasoned on the basis of presumption and reasoning (Ijtihad) in deriving rules from the Qur'an and the Sunnah. But it is possible that they might have based themselves on the form of generality of a word, of an imperative, principle of status quo, import of a word, datermining the conventional meaning of a word and language while harmonising two verses or traditions, validating the application of a restricted rule (muqayyad) to the unrestricted one, basing a general rule on a particular rule, preferring a tradition to another, and establishing a rule by the dictates of pure reason. Where they exceeded these principles, their ijtihad (reasoning) was meant for verification of the basis of the rule (tahqiq manat al-hukm) and not for its refinement (tanqlh) and deduction (istinbat). It is admitted that when a rule of law is known by a principle (d abit), it requires reasoning (ijtihad) for the application of this principle in every situation. The Companions were fully aware that a political ruler (imam) was necessary for the community, that the protec tion of the Qur'an from confusion and oblivion was necessary, and that it could be done only by recording it in a copy-book. All these matters depend on expediency (maslahah) which is proved by the text and consensus. Expediency in respect</page><page sequence="17">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 61 of persons and oiroumstanoes can be determined only by inde pendent reasoning (ijtihad). But this ijtihad is a sort of verifica tion of the basis of rules (tahqiq al-manat) and not qiyas. Where they argued on the basis of similarity of questions, they did so to refute a wrong idea (khayal fasid) and not to derive a rule of law. For instance, they did not validate the exercise of analogy between the compensation of various types of teeth and of the fingers, as argued by Ibn 'Abbas. The reason which they gave for variation in the compensation of teeth is that their use varies from one type of tooth to another. But they do not give this reason in the case of the compensation of fingers. The compensation of fingers is equal, although they vary in their use and size. The same cause ('illah) exists in the case of fingers but this rule does not apply to them. This is ca^ed-naqd which voids qiyas, while q yas is in itself invalid. Al-Ghazali replies : This is a confession of the fact that a rule of law does not necessarily require a decisive evidence (dalil qati'), and that a rule based on conjecture (zann) is valid. It is a confession of the fact that if there had been no other kind of conjecture except the one they have stated, we would not have drawn an analogy between the conjecture of qiyas (zann al qiyas) and the conjecture of ijtihad (zann al-ijtihad) in respect of the import of words and verification of the basis of rules of law. For there may exist a sanction for one kind and not for the other. But it is abundantly clear that the Companions, rtihad was not confined to the questions stated by them ; they exercised analogy (qiyas) and reasoned by similarity of questions (tashbih). Instead, they made a number of decisions that could not be v&amp;lid except when the use of qiyas, is considered valid and the cause of the textual injunction is determined. Al-Ghazali' then illustrates it by citing the examples of qiyas exercised by Abu Bakr, 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas and Zayd b. Thabit in a number of oases.</page><page sequence="18">62 AHMAD HASAN Q. If it is claimed that the Companions themselves originated the principle of qiyas, it is impossible. If they believed in it by hearing from the Prophet, the exponents should produce evidence. We, the opponents of qiyas, ourselves admit that whatever they heard from the Prophet must be followed. In this matter we do not differ from the the experents Qiyas. For instance, suppose the Prophet clearly says that if a man considers a thing or a quality to be the basis of a rule (manat al-hukm), he should follow it. The matter then stands as the opponents think. The quality of the rule, of course, can be a sign of a reason of the rule for him who thinks to be so and not for a another man who disagrees with him. This of course cannot be denied. But one may ask : From where the Companions have derived it. ? In the Qur'an and the Sunnah there is nothing which indicates it. A. Al-Ghazali replies to this in a twofold way: First, we have been saved from bearing this burden. Although the Com panions agreed on the validity of qiyas' in adition to this, it is other it is justified also by some other clear evidence, just as the tradition that the community will never agree on an error. Had they invented it by their own opinion, it would have been right and binding, for God will not let the Prophet's community agree in error. Hence there is no need of searching for evidence. Secondly, it is already known that they believed in qiyas on the basis of numerous proofs (mustanadai), indications (dalalat), factual evidences (qara'in), repetitions which entail necessary knowledge film darurat) about following the principle of qiyas, and basing a rule on a ground (manat), determined by probable opinion. But these proofs could not survive with the passage of time. They were transmitted to the later generations through solitary reports, and not through tawatur (widely transmitted report). These reports do not entail certain know</page><page sequence="19">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 63 ledge. Some Of them were reported through tawatur, but their words were transmitted by a single person (at ad) and they were open to suspicion and interpretation. As regards factual evidence, it is difficult to describe and narrate it in toto. It is, however, established by tawatur that the Companions were agreed (iima6) on the validity of qiyas. Therefore, it is not necessary to search for evidence. Al-Ghazali then cities a number of the Qur'anic verses and traditions, and statements of the Companions in Justification of qiyas.18 Al-Ghazali has discussed a number of rational objections to qiyas raised by its opponents. We analyse them briefly along with their reply in the following paragraphs. Q. Disagreement (ikhtilaf) has no concern with religion, for it is one single entity , it has no diversity as such. Opinion is a source of disagreement. If every jurist is right in his point of view, how would a thing and its antithesis be a part of religion. If only one point of view is right, and others are wrong, it would be impossible, for it shows that divergant speculations exercised by various persons are identical. Speculative problems (zanniyi at) are not based on proof fdaJil) but involve personal inclina tion. Some times a thing is liked by a man but the same thing is disliked by another. The following Qur'anic verses condemn disagreement : . .And if it were from any other than Allah they would have found in it many a discrepancy." (4 :82) -to establish religion and not to be divided there in." (42 : 13) " .and dispute not one with another, lest you get weak-hearted and your power depart". (8 : 46) " As for those who split up their religion and became sects, thou hast no concern with them". (6 : 157)</page><page sequence="20">64 AHMAD HASAN " And be not like those who become divided and dis agreed after clear arguments had come to them". (3:105) After citing these verses the opponents of Qiyas refer to the reports about the condemnation of disagreement by 'Umar and 'Ali. As qiyas results in disagreement, it should be invalid. This criticism has been attributed to the Sh'iah and Ta'lfmiyah. Al-Ghazali replies : We validate two contradictory things in different situations and in respect of two different persons. For example, prayer is binding on a woman who is clean, but not binding on a menstruating woman. If two persons differ in the direction of prayer (qiblah) they may pray facing different directions which they deem correct. A man will be allowed to travel by sea if he is sure that he will return safe and sound. But another will be forbidden to travel by sea if he fears that he will perish. As for the question of how disagreement has been per mitted, it may be noted that the jurist has been commanded to exercise his coniecture (?ann) and opinion, although he is opposed by others. The elimination of disagreement does not fall within his choice. Disagreement will occur of necessity, not because there exists a command for it. The word ikhtiUf (disagreement) which occurs in verse 4 : 82 means contradiction and falsehood claimed by heretics, or it means variation in eloquence and confusion of words which generally occur in human speech on aooount of divergent condi tions. It does not mean negativing divergence in divine injunc tions, for all sacred laws are from God, and they are divergent.</page><page sequence="21">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 65 The Qur'an contains command, prohibition, permission, promise, threat, similitudes and homilies. These are all variations. Q. The questions not covered by any law of the Shari'ah (al-nafy al-asl'O are definitely known, and the questions which have been covered by the text (nass) are also definitely known. Therefore, the questions about which the Shari'ah is silent naturally belong to the former category. How can a thing which is known by certainty be eliminated by qiyas which is speculative (maznun)? A. There are many questions which have not been covered by any text, nor there exists any rule about them. But rules about them can be known by speculation. Therefore, they do not belong to the category about which the Shari'ah is silent. Some of these questions are : generality of meaning, obvious or literal meaning, solitary traditions, opinion of an assessor (muqawwim) about the amount of blood-money and compensation for offences, amount of provision for dependents, compensation for hunting a game during the Hajj, probity of witnesses, and trustworthiness of an opposing party in a council held for giving judgement (majlis al-hukm). All these are speculative questions (maznun) and silence of the Shari'ah can be removed by means of speculation. Moreover, we remove this silence by a decisive evidence (qat'i), for when we have been ordained to follow the probable reason ('illah maznunah), and to follow our con;eoture (zann), we consider the existence of probability (wuiud al-?ann) as certain (qat'i) and the decision by speculation &lt;al-hukm'ind al-zann) as definite. This is how we remove the silence of the Shari 'ah by a definite evidence. As regards prohibition of division and dispute which occurs in verse 3 : 105, it means disagreement in monotheism and belief in the truthfulness of the Prophet. The fundamentals of all monotheistic religions are identical, as implied by the words of the text "after clear arguments had come to them."</page><page sequence="22">66 AHMAD HASAN As to the weakness which results from dispute as indicated in verse 8 : 46, it means the support of religion. How can there be room for qiyas in the Shari'ah which is based on an unquestioning obedience to commands (ta'qb bud). The Shari'ah differentiates between similars (muta mathilai) and combines unlikes (mutafarriqai). It comma ndsto wash the garment if it is smeared with the urine of a female child and to sprinkle water if smeared with the urine of a male child. Taking a bath is binding in the case of ejculation of sperm and menstruation but not in the case of urine and prostatic fluid (madhi). The Shari'ah distinguishes between the atonement for prayer and atonement for fasting. It allows looking at a slave girl but not at a free woman. The Shari'ah also prescribes like laws for unlike things. For example, the compensation for hunting a game by a pilgrim in the state of ihram is binding whether one hunts it intentionally or accidentally. But it distinguishes between the wilful and accidental shaving of hair, and wilful and accidental use of perfume while wearing pilgrim robe (Ihram). It makes expia tion fkaflarah) binding in the case of zihar, homicide, breaking of an oath, and wilful breaking of the fast. But it commands to kill an adulterer, an apostate, a slayer, and the one who abandons prayer. The Prophet is reported to have allowed Abu Burdah to sacrifice an animal which was below the age prescribed for saorifical animals. He reportedly said to him " It is sufficient from you and not from anyone else after you." The Prophet was given a concession by God to marry more than four wives according to the Qur'anio verse which says" "It is specially for thee and not for the believers."* * How can one combine a point not covered by the text (maskut) with a point covered by the text (rriantuq) in a Shari'ah with such a type of</page><page sequence="23">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 67 system (minhaj) ? A text in every place is an arbitrary judgement and unquestioning ordinance.19 Al-Ghazall replies : We do not deny that the Shari'ah contains arbitrary judgements (tahakkumat) as well as supra rational commands and prohibitions (ta'abbudat). The legal injunctions are of three kinds: injunctions that are not causaJ; injunctions that are causal; injunctions that are doubtful. We do not exercise qiyas until we find an evidence for the causality of the injunction. It is implied from the derivative cause. The same cause is also found in the parallel case. Hence the objection of the opponent does not hold gold. As regards rituals Cibadat) they belong to the category of non-causal injunctions. Hence it is not allowed to exercise qiyas in the case of uttering tckbir (God is most great), taslim (salutation), and fatihah (recitation of surat a^F&amp;tihah) during prayer. Similarly, in the case of Zakat exercise of analogy between the textual and non-textual rules is not allowed. We exercise qfyas in social transactions (mu'amlat), penalties for offences, and in those matters which are known by indications (qarain) and inwardly human interests.20 Al-Ba?rl and al-'Amidl have attributed this obiection to al-Nazzam. They have expounded it in greater detail providing more illustrations than al-Ghazill. They have replied that what counts in qiyas is the similarity or dissimilarity of the 'illah and not of the verses themselves. Two cases may be similar hi form but dissimilar in respect of 'illah. The similar oases for which the lawgiver has given dissimlar laws are in fact not similar, and vice vfersa. Each case has its own rule of law. Similar oases are those who causes are identical, though they are dissimilar in form.21</page><page sequence="24">68 AHMAD HASAN Q. The Prophet was gifted with compendious speech (jawami' al-kalim). How does it suit him that he leaves a terse and intelligible style and adopts lengthy and confusing one. Why did he specify only six commodities for usury ? Why did he not say clearly "I forbid usury in all edibles or in all com modities which are measurable? Has be done so in order that the people wander in the darkness of ignorance? A. Had he mentioned only six commodities and mentioned along with them clearly that the rest of the com modities were not subject to usury and their analogical exten sion (qiyas) was forbidden, it would have doubtless clarified the position more fully, and left little room for ignorance and disagreement. Why he did not elucidate these points despite his ability to remove the doubt by his eloquence, the doubt arising from general words and their literal meaning ? He could explain all the content of the Qur'an which was transmitted by tawatur (wide and constant transmission) in order to eliminate any possible doubt in the text and chain of transmission. He could remove the doubt of anthropomorphism from divme attributes by giving the right interpretation of all possible dis puted points in rational questions ('aqliyat). When he did not do this, there is no room for accusing God and His Prophet of giving arbitrary judgement (tahakkum) in his elucidation, ins truction and short or lengthy statements. God fully knows the my steries of all this. It is already known to God that He has ordained the learned to exercise ijtikad (independent reasoning) and to strive for discovering the secrets of the Shari'ah. This shows that he should express some points and be silent over others, and direct them in a way which stimulates one to exercise ijtihad. One may find a reference to it in the Quranic verse, "Allah will exalt those who believe and those who are given knowledge to a high rank."22 This is according to the view</page><page sequence="25">THE CRITIQUE OF QIYAS 69 which says that it is binding on God to do what is fitting (salah). But according to us, (Sunnis) God is free to do with His servants as He wishes. NOTES 1. Ibn Qutaybah, Td'wll Mukhtalif al-Hadith, Cairo. Matba'ah Kurdistan al-'Ilmiyah, 1326 A.H.p. 65. 2.
