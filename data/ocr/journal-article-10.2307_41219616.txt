<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pendragon's Ancestors Nathalie Ginoux Introduction This paper's aim is to give insight into a few elements of ancient Celtic warrior groups from an iconographie and archaeological point of view. The ancient Celts (600 ВС - AD 100) were the first European civilization from a Mediterranean context defined by a common language, art, and religion. It is known that they did not write except on some very practical occasions, as there was a taboo on any religious or sacred topics.1 In this unwritten tradition, Celtic iconography is our only key to enlightening their common vision of the world, their belief system, and their ideology. In addition, this paper will address the emblematic motif usually defined as "the dragon pair," a topic that has been exclusively reserved to scabbards and consequently to the protection of swords. This attempt, from an iconographical perspective, is to provide a plausible explanation for the adoption of the dragon theme by the ancient Celts and its transformation and transfer as a visual code on their swords' scabbards. Framework for an Iconographical Enquiry From the early fourth century ВС, the Celts arose on the stage of European history, largely through the mechanics of warfare. So it is necessary to begin with a rapid review of the social context during the La Tene period (fifth century ВС), through the way that warriors attempted to display their status, power, and lifestyle. Archaeological evidence from cemeteries throughout France, Bulgaria, Poland, and Italy shows the outspread of a society from the end of the fifth century and especially by the fourth century ВС, 1 Ñeque fas esse existimant ea litteris mandare, cum in reliquisfere rebus, publicis privatisque rationibus Graecis litteris utantur.

From this time, the military power of the Celts prevailed over a part of the Mediterranean world. This increasing pressure led, in parallel, to the reproduction of narratives in classical sources, vividly enlightening some specific Celtic features, quickly transformed into stereotypes about the barbarians.2 Wide mobility and ceaseless movements of war bands and mercenaries during the fourth and the third centuries ВС induced an unprecedented spreading of weapons and consequently of ornaments: griffins and dragons now decorated scabbards. Only the western parts of the La Tene world3 including most of the British Islands, Ireland, and Iberia seem removed from this phenomenon of iconographie spread that the archaeologist José- Maria De Navarro used to call an "inter-Celtic currency."4 Among the classical sources, we can appreciate descriptions of a warlike society, mostly described by ancient authors writing about the Celtic expansion from the fourth century ВС. These Greek and Roman texts (mainly from Polybius, Livy, Diodorus Siculus, Posidonius, and Julius Caesar) provide informative descriptions and anecdotes about warfare, battles, raids, and conquests. More than two centuries of threats, conflicts, and confrontations with Celtic bands, raiders, armies, and mercenaries deeply influenced the Celtic warrior's image during the Iron Age. It was diverse and dependent on specific contexts. Commentators and historians thus project, even in their ethnographic descriptions, a few stereotypes about "The Gaul Barbarian" such as wildness, impulsivity, disorder, superstition, and a primitive way of life. However, they all insist on one point: their attitude in war as brave, fearless, and furious. This kind of positive appreciation thus values their victories over powerful enemies.5 2 The same topic (barbarians versus the civilized world) occurs in the Pergamene sculpture during the second century ВС.

Dating from the fifth century ВС, a significant iconographical piece is the highly decorated scabbard's bronze sheet in grave number 994 from the extensive Hallstatt cemetery in Austria.10 The depiction on the scabbard of a military parade with horsemen and infantrymen is very significant. The armament, horse's harness, costumes, shoes, cavalry, and foot soldier's weapons are probably similar to those in the armies moving towards North Italy and Rome at the beginning of the fourth century ВС. A few axes (dated at the very latest 550-500 ВС), some of them also from the eponymous Hallstatt site, and fibulas depict horses and horsemen. It might suggest that they were probably used as cavalry emblems.11 We know that a few centuries later, at the end of the Iron Age, equivalents of these equestrian axes in Celt-Iberian contexts clearly bore a similar theme. This long chronological time-span would consequently reflect the same ideological warrior system.12 From the formative period of La Tene (fifth century ВС), in the Hunsrück-Eifel Culture context,13 we have the depiction of a horseman engraved on a metallic piece, probably from a wood jug (an item related with the élite lifestyle), found in a burial in Kärlich (near Coblence, in Germany).14 This image includes several key elements, like the heroic figure of a naked warrior, the ithyphallic representation, and the severed head hanged on the horse's neck.15 10 Karl Kromer, Das Gräberfeld von Hallstatt (Sansoni, Firenze, 1959), pl.201- 202.

We admire the formal and technical qualities and the enigmatic dimensions, but we get no information on their prime significance and function, neither from the point of view of craftsmen, sponsoring warriors, or from who conceived them (in some cases the druids, according to some scholars16). In this context, decorations and ornaments suggest a specific image's use, controlled by the warrior élites in spite of their uneven situation during the last two centuries ВС; it seems to have been a significant issue. From Theme to Symbol (fifth-fourth centuries ВС) In the course of the sixth and fifth centuries ВС, we can discern two main visual expressions: the first one, abstract, is the old native tradition of geometry inherited from trans-Alpine Europe during the Late Bronze Age (Urnfield Culture) and the First Iron Age (Hallstatt Culture).

At that time, status and prestige were first of all shown through the wealth and attention paid both to the horse (especially the harness fitting, yoke, chariot) and the feast in the grave, through the deposit of goods such as containers and jugs.19 One of the earliest Celtic dragon's representations appears as a zoomorphic lyre on this kind of vessel, a pottery, dated from the second half of the fifth century ВС, found in La Cheppe, in the Marne area.20 The body of the beaker is adorned with four figures of dragons whose serpent bodies and griffin heads are engraved.

The confronted posture corresponds to the known position of dragons on scabbards. Figure 2 Some preliminary remarks concerning the iconographical materials are necessary before considering the system defined in this paper as "Celtic warrior iconography" in weapons - in particular swords and their scabbards from the fourth century ВС. One can discern three levels in this system: the first one as "Patterns", the second one as "Themes" and the last one, more complex, as "Formulas". Within these Formulas, my focus is on the rise of what I suggest to call: a "dyad" warrior/dragon. The representation of this kind of dragon has nothing to do with the medieval ones. But even if they don't have the same shape, they probably hold the same symbolic signification: i.e. very early, about 380 ВС, this topic was exclusive to scabbards, and consequently to the sword protection, as we read in the Arthurian legends, about Excalibur. However, in its formative period, the keystone of Celtic Art is ambiguity and reversibility. Celtic iconography deals with two specific and fundamental principles, which must be emphasized: the first one concerns a symbolic use of figuration, the second one, seemingly more formal, is a specific skill called in this paper "double reading."21 21 John- Vincent-Stanley Megaw, Art of the European Iron Age: A study of the elusive image (Bath: Adams and Dart, 1970). 69</page><page sequence="8">pendragon's ancestors I I REPERTOIRE I I Historical and context ot use ^^ S-forms, griffins, dragons, ^^ ^^ ideological ot use ^^ anthropomorphic elements ^^ ^^ contexts I trad.t.onS.

One of the clearest examples of this anatomic discontinuity appears on a series of three armlets and four tores found in the Erstfeld hoard22 (Uri, Switzerland) dated about 400 ВС clearly showing the symbolic charge of most patterns. The purpose of the second principle of "double reading" is to introduce an unstable element to a binary opposition system. In our opinion, it is fundamentally combined with the concept of the Celtic dragon motif. We might explain it using Joseph Jastrow's famous Duck/Rabbit, an ambiguous figure in which the brain switches 22 Martin A. Guggisberg, Der Goldschatz von Erstfeld. Ein keltischer Bilderzyklus zwischen Mitteleurope und der Mittelmeerwelt ' Antiqua 32 (Basel: Verlag Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Ur-und Frühgesschichte, 2000). 70</page><page sequence="9">NATHALIE GINOUX between seeing a rabbit and a duck.23 This image has been discussed by Sir Ernst Gombrich in a chapter of his famous book Art and Illusion to express the levels in visual reception.24 This process of binary reversibility is very clear, for instance, on a series of belt- clasps, such as the famous one from Somme-Bionne "FHomme- Mort."25 Like Jastrow's Duck/Rabbit, by turning the griffin 90 degrees, it seems transformed into an herbivore. However (as emphasized by Wittgenstein and Gombrich) it is impossible to see the patterns - confronted griffins and opposed herbivore - at the same time. Figure 4 Such a "double reading" is probably similar to that which can be applied to another well-known large beaker from the Marne area (Ecury-sur-Coole "Les Côtes de Marne"), which increases the double 23 The picture was originally used by the American psychologist Joseph Jastrow.

To see the primary image, we have to look at the background to reproduce the plain original motif: a chain of the heads of birds of prey with crests on the top. Figure 5 On a bronze chariot piece from Bad Dürkheim (Rheinland- Plafz, Germany)27 we find a similar gamble with an ambiguous and reversible figure. The adornment brings together three qualities - vegetal, animal, and human - in a complex way by using openwork. Though it is incomplete, we can discern different readings, the most obvious being the zoomorphic lyre with its two crested heads of birds of prey, facing out. The end of the 'S' shape here becomes a leg or a paw. The most allusive reading is displayed in the centre 26 Musée d'archéologie Nationales, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (France), collection A.

We find the same theme in two polymorphous creatures with theriomorphic, vegetal, and anthropomorphic features symmetrically flanking a mask on another chariot piece from Austria (Unterradlberg near Sankt Polten) also dated from the second half of the fifth century ВС.28 Iconography on this alloy copper linchpin presents a palmette shape surmounting a very schematic face. Two zoomorphic 'S' shapes are framing the human mask. The Hallstatt scabbard's chape-end (from grave 994) previously discussed, shows how early the emblematic use of dragons was exhibited by the Celts on their sword scabbards. But the image is once more ambiguous and reversible because it switches between a view of a horse head, and two serpents. Thus, the overall outline of the chape-end is an equine head on which some anatomical notations such as eyes and small ears are depicted. The lateral view enhances the ophidian shape of two composite creatures with a spiral marking the lower jaw and some appendage overhanging the skull.29 Though the Dragon theme was not their creation, it is clear that the Ancient Celts transformed it early and transferred it onto their swords' scabbards as early as the middle of the fifth century ВС. At that point the dragon turned into a protector, at first on the chape- ends, and a little later near the sheath's mouth. Indeed, this placement, often with a stylized face, was tightly linked to the Tree of Life (through the palmette shape) and appears with a strong symbolic connotation on a new piece of Celtic weaponry, one of their most technically complex achievements: the iron sword scabbard. Once standardized, this scabbard form was used by its 28 Johannes- Wolfgang Neugebauer, Alois Gattringer, "Rettungsgrabung im unteren Traisental im Jahre 1984," Fundberichte aus Österreich 23 (1984): 97- 128.

Two Golden Snakes Thirty years ago the American archaeologist José-Maria De Navarro published his monograph about the swords and scabbards found in the site of La Tene, on the Swiss lake of Neuchâtel. In this context, he defined as "inter Celtic currency" three motifs adorning the mouths of the scabbards (respectively termed Type 1, 2, and 3).30 Figure 6 The corpus was, at his time of publication, at about thirty. Today we know of approximately two hundred scabbards, widespread over the whole of Celtic Europe. The high number of discoveries 30 De Navarro, (op. cit.), 217-218. 74</page><page sequence="13">NATHALIE GINOUX compensates for the scarcity of the context for the finds. This increase in the number of pieces has recently allowed for the definition of a new typology within a new interpretative framework. The first type is called the "Dragon Pair" (or Zoomorphic Lyre); the second one, called "Confronted Griffins" is made of two antithetic dragon-headed beasts, having free-standing forelegs. The distribution map of finds shows a lack in Ireland, Britain (with only two finds in the Thames basin), and Spain (only one). Setting apart in this paper the consideration of the origin of the dragons, the main interest here, is the use of the Dragon Pair motif by the Ancient Celts, probably linked to a symbolic content established at the latest during the second half of the fifth century ВС. Indeed, from this period we can observe various iconographie combinations from antithetical compositions of kneeling griffins on which the human anatomical notations are explicit. These composite creations, which are not sphinxes, frame either a frontal face or an anthropomorphic figure (God or Hero), Figure 7. This framework is particularly clear on two well-known pieces, which have in common their link with warfare. The first one is an openwork bronze and coral belt buckle found in Burial 2 of Weisskirchen (Sarre, Germany); the second one is the bronze jug in Grave 1 of Glauberg (Hesse, Germany).31 The belt clasp of Weisskirchen is probably an iconographical key. Sometimes depicted as orientalizing sphinxes or winged lions,32 these back- turned creatures, framing a central mask, are in fact original creations, or more precisely Celtic re-creations. They are characterized as following by: the anthropomorphic heads which are the same as on the Hallstatt scabbard; the design of the bodies; the prominent eyes; the crest behind the skulls; the feet ending the legs; and the wings. It seems to express an iconographie formula, a kind of "dyad" warrior versus fantastic creature. This appears clearly in the ornamentation of the Glauberg jug from Hesse. 31 Otto H. Frey, Fritz R. Herrmann, "Ein frühkeltischer Fürstengrabhügel am Glauberg im Wetteraukreis, Hessen" Germania 75 (1997): 459-550. 32 Déchelette, (op. cit.) 1239, fig. 525. 75</page><page sequence="14">pendragon's ancestors Figure 7 The top part of the Weisskirchen belt clasp can be compared with other combinations from anthropomorphic and monstrous items, such as the golden tores from Erstfeld or the engraved bronze scabbard from Hallstatt. Therefore, a plausible explanation for the genesis of the Dragon Pair on Celtic swords would be the outspread at the end of the fifth century ВС of a symbolic theme directly connected to the warriors' protection. Its visual ambiguity proceeds directly from the "double reading." At this moment, the Dragon Pair becomes the very highly standardized emblem of the warrior function. Former funeral contexts are in the Marne area and Italy.33 This pattern must be related to improvement in warrior outfits, mostly the sword and its iron scabbard, at the beginning of the fourth century ВС, at the first Celtic expansion southward. A series of very lush contexts suggests a special status for some bearers, those with sword scabbards adorned with the Dragon Pair. These scabbards are generally wider with extremely careful and fine work. A convincing example is the coral inlaid34 scabbard found in Grave 163 of the Enserune cemetery (Hérault, France), widely known as a very important place for mercenary trade throughout the 33 Ginoux, (op. cit.), tab. 3, 90-98, 102-105, 34 Pline l'Ancien, Histoire Naturelle, XXXII, 77(Eugène de Saint-Denis, trans, [Paris, Les Belles Lettres, collection des universités de France, Série latine, 19661). 76</page><page sequence="15">NATHALIE GINOUX Iron Age.35 During the last third of the fourth century, increasing warrior activity brings Celtic people to the southeast of Europe around the time of Alexander the Great's death (after the defeat of the Autariates in 310 ВС). The Griffin Pair type diffusion is linked to foot warriors, as the griffin leg shows on their specific weapon an adaptation to their primary function which is to run.36 It is nevertheless contemporary with the Dragon Pair type on longer and wider swords, maybe belonging to an equestrian élite,31 given that, in most cases, they are found in graves of wealthy charioteers and maybe horsemen.38 Concerning their diffusion, there are fewer samples of dragons than griffins. This allows us to suppose that the visual code type 1 (Dragon Pair) involved horsemen or fighters engaged in mixed training, as is said, for example, by Polybius about the Battle of Cannes in 216 ВС.39 Conclusion Interpreting the rise and the change in the Dragon Pair motif on weapons in the light of the military history of the Ancient Celts is an absolute necessity for research on this topic. The process of rise and transformation of this motif on Celtic scabbards leads to an explanation about the creation of a new and specific theme: warrior versus monster. It appears as a continuous and internal phenomenon. Very early, at the end of the fifth century ВС, the Celts invented a 35 André Rapin, Martine Schwaller, M., "Contribution à l'étude de l'armement celtique: la tombe 163 d'Ensérune (Hérault)," Revue Archéologique de Narbonnaise, 20(1987): 155-183.

The first one, characterized by the head of a bird of prey, a leg, a wing, and a prominent eye, is the most common. It refers to foot soldiers.

It is precisely this serpent-like body shape that is described in accounts of King Arthur's fabled sword Excalibur.40 The image of a Griffin Pair carved with a gold wire at the beginning of the third century ВС could have been like the two golden snakes carved on Arthur's sword.
