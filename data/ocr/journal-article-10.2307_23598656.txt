<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES WHEN IS THE TIME OF Η ΑΚΗ Ε LI by David Henschke The time of assembling the hakhel is recorded in two extant versions of Mishnah Sotah. According to one version it is held on the evening after the first day of Sukkot while, in the other, it is held after the last day. Both versions are incompatible with the continuation of the text, which speaks of hakhel being held 'on the eighth day'. That is to say, after the date mentioned in the one version, and before the time mentioned in the second. Following a detailed discussion of the various proposals offered in explanation of this mishnah, the present article suggests that it contains two different strata. The original mishnah did not contain the reference to 'the eighth day' and spoke of hakhel as being observed 'at the close of the last day of the holiday'. This would refer to the day after Shemini Azeret, before those who had come to Jerusalem for the holiday returned home. According to this version, for which support is given in the article, hakhel was held not on Sukkot itself but in the context of the pilgrimage, which continued up until Shemini Azeret. In the schools of the later TannaHm, when the question of hakhel had become purely academic, the Biblical verses were construed as referring specifically to the holiday. The words of the mishnah ('at the close of the [last day of the] holiday') were construed as referring not to the day subsequent to the eighth day, but rather to the night immediately following. This reflects the fact that vis-a-vis the laws of the Temple, the night is affiliated with the previous day. Therefore, the night after Shemini Azeret is included in the eighth day and hence part of the holiday, as the passage was then apprehended. Consequently, the words 'on the eighth day' were added to the mishnah in order to elucidate that the night after Shemini Azeret is indeed part of the eighth day and, accordingly, part of the holiday itself. The article then shows how this emendation became part of all subsequent textual and exegetical history of the mishnah. This mishnah may be seen as an example of the interpretive activity pursued by the later Tanna'im through the exegesis and emendation of the early text. BIRAH AS AN ARCHITECTURAL TERM IN RABBINIC LITERATURE by Pinchas Mandel The article discusses the occurrences of the word birah (and its Aramaic equivalent, birta) in the rabbinic corpus. It is demonstrated that the word is not identical with the well-known Semitic term birtu/birta/birah of the ancient Mesopotamian and Persian periods (called here birah I), which denotes variously a garrison city, fortress, or acropolis (and specifically, a fortified governmental centre) - all containing many buildings of different types. The later</page><page sequence="2">VIII ENGLISH SUMMARIES occurrences denote rather a single building which, while noted for its height, is not characterized by its strength or splendour. Through comparison with occurrences of the word in cognate literature of the late Second Temple period, it is shown that the common characteristic of all edifices denoted by birah is their form, which is that of an enclosure: viz. they are all buildings constructed around a central, closed space or courtyard. Specifically, it is posited that the birah of rabbinic literature is to be identified with an urban dwelling common in the Mediterranean area during the Roman period, whether in the form of a private house (domus) or, more commonly, a multistoried tenement building {insula). These buildings were self-enclosed structures, often built around a closed, inner courtyard; in particular, the inhabitants of an insula were known to be prone to such disasters as fire, collapse of the building, and falling from its upper stories - precisely the contexts in which birah occurs in the rabbinic corpus. Similarly, when representing the Temple in rabbinic literature, birah is to be understood as denoting the Temple enclosure, including the heikhal and the 'azarot. This definition (called here birah II) may be related etymologically to birah I, all of whose structures, indeed, contain an element of enclosure. It is also suggested that the peculiar uses of the Greek term βάρις, and its putative relationship to birah, may now be explained: the Greek term, originally corresponding to structures closely similar to those of birah II (and in particular denoting a manor house), came to be identified in Josephus' writings, as well as in late Septuagint revisions, with various fortified structures, similar in form and purpose to those of birah I. This may be explained by viewing such uses as a caique, based on the semantic and phonetic similarities between birah I and birah II; this usage would consequently be a peculiarity of Greek-speaking Semites (and Jews in particular) of the late Second Temple period and afterwards, and this is indeed the testimony of Jerome concerning this term. ADDENDA TO THE TALMUDIC DICTIONARY (III): אחניג (ARZANIG) by David Rosenthal The word ארזניג occurs in a passage of the Oxford Genizah, BT Tamid 32b, in the phrase שדון ארזניג במידי. It is a hapax legomenon in the Talmud, and other extant versions of this passage have מחשב חשיבנא, הבו לי מידי. The word ארזניג is borrowed from the Persian arzanig, signifying 'valuable', 'worthy'. The author suggests that its infiltration into the Talmud probably occured during the Geonic period, when the aggada received its linguistic dress and the Talmud was still transmitted orally.</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES IX ADDITIONAL TEQl'ATA FRAGMENTS IN THE STYLE OF YOSE B. YOSE by Shulamit Elizur In Tarbiz, LIII (1984), pp. 547-558, portions of two unknown cycles of teqfata piyyutim were published on the basis of fragments from the Cairo Geniza. The beginning of the second cycle, missing at the time of publication, has now come to light and is here published for the first time. In addition, portions of yet another cyle of teqfata piyyutim are published herein. This hitherto unknown cycle proves to be the most comprehensive of the ancient teqfata-cycles, and it features all the structural devices found in the other cycles together. Anadiplosis (shirshur) of biblical verses forms a vital part of this cycle's intricate structure; the paytan has, at times, chosen verses whose inclusion in the piyyut runs contrary to the laws of halacha. THE SEVEN DOUBLE LETTERS BGD KFRT: ON THE DOUBLE REISH AND THE BACKGROUND OF SEFER YEZIRA by Yehuda Liebes Sefer Yezira mentions seven letters which have a double pronunciation: BGD KFRT. Since in Hebrew only six such letters are known, namely BGD KFT, this assertion by Sefer Yezira has puzzled many commentators and researchers. The solutions offered for this question failed to provide a double pronunciation for the letter Reish of the same category as the double pronunciation of the other six letters. The present article provides such a solution. It argues that in Hebrew a phonetic process occurred similar to that known from the history of the Greek language, i.e., the plosive letters BGD became spirants, and so also the aspirates KH PH TH, which lost their aspiration. However in Greek the letter R is also sometimes aspirate, and precisely in similar circumstances when the Hebrew BGD KFT have the 'hard' pronunciation, namely at the beginning of a word, and when the letter is doubled. It is suggested here that at the time of Sefer Yezira Hebrew was pronounced like the Greek in its transitional stage, when these plosive and aspirate letters still retained their original pronunciation in certain cases, and that in these cases the Hebrew Reish was also aspirate. There are some other indications for the aspiration of the Reish. One is the alteration of the name Sarai into Sarah (Gen. 17, 16), which in the LXX appears as an alteration from Sara to Sarra. In grammatical theory too a similarity can be found between Sefer Yezira and the Greek. Sefer Yezira calls the two pronunciations of BGD KFRT 'lenient and hard', corresponding to the spiritus lenis and spiritus asper of the Greek and Latin grammarians. In ancient Greek grammars the present author found some parallels to Sefer Yezira: a parallel for the correspondence that Sefer Yezira makes between the double letters and the seven planets, and other parallels, e.g. a parallel for the ten Sefirot. All the parallels appear more original in Greek than in Sefer Yezira, and presumably the author of Sefer Yezira adopted them from their original Greek grammatical context and used them for its cosmogonical</page><page sequence="4">ENGLISH SUMMARIES mystical purpose. These instances all suggest that Sefer Yezira was written under Greek influence, that is to say around the third century C.E., and in a provenance such as Palestine. EVIDENCE OF A THEOLOGICAL CONTROVERSY IN SOD HA-SODOT BY R. ELHANAN BEN YAKAR OF LONDON by Joseph Dan The esoteric works of R. Elhanan ben Yakar, who lived in Northern France and England in the first half of the thirteenth century, are one of the most important sources at our disposal for the understanding of esoteric theology and mysticism in Europe in the period. His works were briefly studied by G. Scholem and G. Vajda, but they are mostly still in manuscripts, awaiting a scholarly edition. R. Elhanan wrote two commentaries on the Book of Creation (Sefer Yezira), and a theological treatise, Sod ha-Sodot ('The Secret of Secrets'). Analysis of this last work indicates that it is anthological in character, despite its main purpose: harmonization of the story of the creation as told in Genesis and that included in the Sefer Yezira. R. Elhanan's main source were the writings of an anonymous group of mystics, known as the 'Special Cherub Circle', relying on a mystical tradition attributed to Joseph ben Uzziel. This circle created a theology according to which the divine world is divided into three strata, each emanated from the one above: the supreme Godhead, who is the creator; the divine Glory (kavod), who is hidden from all eyes and is the dynamic, active part of the divine pleroma within the created world; and the Special Cherub, who is described in anthropomorphic terms, and is the power revealed to the prophets. This division is found, with various modifications, in the works of other mystics and esoterics in central Europe in this period and constitutes the most distinctive theological idea characteristic of Ashkenazi Hasidic esoteric thought. Among the sections included in the Sod ha-Sodot there are, however, texts which present a different, opposing view, according to which the division of the divine world into separate, functional pleromatic parts is denied, and creation, revelation and divine providence are attributed directly to the supreme Godhead. These texts reflect a conservative view, opposing the theological radicalism of the other circles. Sod ha-Sodot is thus a document testifying to the theological controversies among Jewish esoterics and mystics in the High Middle Ages.</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES XI BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY: A STUDY OF THE DE LA FRAGILIDAD HUMANA YINCLINACION DEL HOMBRE AL PECCADO OF MENASSEH BEN ISRAEL by Nissim Yosha A fresh look at Menasseh ben Israel's composition, published in Amsterdam, 1642, shows that it is not, as some scholars have suggested, a theological tract polemicizing against the Christian doctrine of original sin. Rather, the tract was intended for the edification of the 'nation', the former conversos whose return to overt Judaism was marked by a grappling with questions of theology, as well as those of more practical nature. One such question concerned observance of the numerous religious precepts, whose yoke weighed heavily upon them. Ben Israel seeks to come up with answers capable of satisfying the former conversos. Τ rue, he does adopt the doctrine of original sin in its Pauline-Augustinian formulation, and even takes issue against Pelagius, who rejected it. But he also stresses that redemption is to be found in the observance of the relgious precepts, and not in the atoning sacrifice of the Christian messiah. He reinforces this theological assertion by adopting the contemporary anthropological teachings of the Spanish thinker, Juan Huarte de San Juan. His Examen de ingenios para las ciencias crystallized in its day a progressive outlook concerning the ability of man to combat, by means of education, that which his origin or environment had ordained. Ben Israel believed that the religious precepts should be used for educational goals, namely, leading the conversos to redemption and ultimate perfection. Alongside this fusion of theology and anthropology Ben Israel incorporates two novel suggestions: (1) classification of the religious precepts into three different categories, according to the Aristotelian terminology of ethikos, politikos and oikonomikos; (2) a recommendation to establish a library for Judaic studies, organized into its respective branches. By making this suggestion, Ben Israel anticipated the German Wissenschaft des Judentums by two hundred years, for it, of course, organized Judaic studies in similar fashion. SOME NOTES ABOUT THE PRAYER FOR THE KING JONATHAN by David Flusser In Tarbiz (Ά Scroll from Qumran which includes Part of Psalm 154 and a Prayer for King Jonathan and his Kingdom', Tarbiz, LX [1991], pp. 295-324) a fragment from Qumran was published by Esther and Hanan Eshel and Ada Yardeni containing a prayer for the king Jonathan. There is no doubt that he is to be identified as the Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus (103-76 BCE.). The Qumran Covenantors disliked this king, but the presence of a prayer in his honour can be understood if one assumes that the scroll was not composed by a member of the sect. The prayer is highly interesting, especially because its author prays not only for the king and the holy city of Jerusalem, but for the people of Israel in the whole world. The ties between Jerusalem and the dispersion were strengthened as a consequence of the Maccabean victories, and the new prayer is one of the oldest witnesses of this change.</page><page sequence="6">XII ENGLISH SUMMARIES ON THE LOCATION OF ONE 'MIKAN AMRU' PASSAGE IN THE SIFRA by Adiel Schremer This short paper is a response to a note made by S. Naeh in his article 'Polishing Measures and Cleaning Scales' (Tarbiz, LIX [1990], p. 385, n. 23). Naeh argued for the preference of the reading found in the Oxford manuscript of the Sifra, which places the passage מיכן אמרו הדקין שבכלי חרס וכוי correctly after the drasha ומניין לרבות את שברי כלי חרס תלמוד לומר וכל כלי חרס, not after the drasha אשר יפול מהם as found in other text-witnesses of the Sifra. His main argument is the difficulty of explaining the common reading, which seems to have no sense. We have suggested treating this problematic passage as a marginal addition that made its way into the text in a wrong location. This conclusion leads us to think of the possibility that many other mikan amru passages in halakhic midrashim constitute a later stratum of the text, material brought in by ancient scholars who enlarged the text by adding to it from other sources. MS LEIPZIG 1 AND RASHI'S COMMENTARY ON THE BIBLE by Abraham Grossman The author responds to the article by Elazar Touitou on the nature of the commentary by Rashi found in MS Leipzig 1 (Tarbiz, LXI, pp. 85-116). Grossman is of the opinion that Rabbi Makhir, the author of this manuscript, did indeed have at hand the original manuscript of Rabbi Shemaiah, Rashi's pupil. Hence the manuscript is most importance for studying the textual recension of Rashi's commentary on the Bible. The few additions that do appear in this commentary but not found in the original recension of Rashi were made either by Rabbi Shemaiah or Rabbi Makhir, and not by other scribes as Touitou would contend.</page></plain_text>
