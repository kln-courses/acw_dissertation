A re-examination of Tukanoan social organisation. - The Tukanoans of NW Amazonia are usually character- ised as being divided into intermarrying patrilineal groups each subdivided into a set of ranked clans or sibs. This essay argues that the concept of "house societies" pro- vides a more accurate rendering of local idioms than "descent". Social relations are conceptualised in two different, complementary ways. One conceptualisation, emphasis- ing hierarchy and exclusiveness, is more pertinent to mythological and ritual contexts. The other more egalitarian, inclusive conceptualisation, emphasises consanguinity and is more pertinent to daily life. Each corresponds to a different gendered projection of the house as a physical structure. Viewed in this light, structural parallels with the Guianas and Central Brazil become more apparent. By putting, so to speak, "two in one", the house accomplishes a sort of inside-out topological revers- al, it replaces an internal duality with an external unity. (C. Lévi-Strauss, The Way of the Masks: 184-185). Differentiation does not change the global setting, given once and for all; in a hierarchical schema the parts that nest one inside the other may increase in number without changing the law. (L. Dumont, Homo Hierarchicus: 243) Descent Groups or Houses? speaking, the kinship systems of lowland South American can be divided into two basic types. In Central Brazil, we find Crow/ Omaha-like relationship terminologies associated with systems of name transmission and an emphasis on moieties. But here we typically find neither unilineal descent groups nor clearly structured marriage systems, the conven- tionally anticipated concomitants of Crow/Omaha terminologies and moiety systems. In Amazonia proper, we find variations on a Dravidian model with L'Homme 126-128, avr.-déc 1993, XXXIII (2-4), pp. 95-120.</page><page sequence="2">96 STEPHENHUGH-JONES symmetrical alliance and a two-section terminology. But here we typically find cognatic forms of social organisation and a tendency towards various forms of oblique marriage, features which make analysis in terms of conventional alliance theory difficult, at least if this is taken to imply exchange between groups defined in lineal terms. Even when we do find groups with apparently unilineal features the notion of descent has proved problematic. Ideological emphasis on descent-like principles is rarely matched by the presence of socially significant corporate groups, common substance is rarely a significant attribute of clans or lineages, and interest in genealogies rarely extends much beyond the realm of the living.1 In this recalcitrant analytic sea, Northwest Amazonia has sometimes seemed like a haven of calm for, here at last, in Shapiro's words (1987: 303), "patri- liny [. . .] presents enough of the classic and familiar features of descent, in- cluding a segmentary and hierarchical ordering of descent units, for the use of these concepts to be relatively unproblematic". This secure view of North- west Amazonian social structure, though not without some foundation, also has its problems. The notion of descent fits uneasily with native idioms and it comes complete with implications of corporateness and segmentation which make little sense in this context. Furthermore, notions of descent are relevant largely in ritual and mythological contexts and are not to be confused with an ethos of consanguinity which is more pertinent to everyday life. This essay2 is offered as both an experiment and a document. In it I want to examine whether some of Lévi-Strauss' ideas concerning ' 'sociétés à mai- son" can provide fresh insight into certain features of the social organisation of the eastern Tukanoan-speaking societies of Northwest Amazonia. At the same time I want to explore the ramifications of wii or house as an indigenous category and to provide some account of the rich sociological and symbolic imagery that surrounds Tukanoan architecture. Some 40,000 Tukanoan Indians inhabit a large area of NW Amazonia, an area comprising the basin of the Rio Vaupés or Uaupés which straddles the Colombia-Brazil frontier. The Tukanoans are divided into some twenty named exogamic patrilineal groups each having ties to a specific territory and each speak- ing a different but related language. They have a Dravidian prescriptive two-line relationship terminology associated with a system of symmetric alliance. Langu- age functions as a badge of identity and is often referred to in the specification of marriage rules: a person should normally marry someone who speaks different- ly from themselves. Children speak their father's language but also know and understand that of their mother. Repeated marriages between af finally related groups, the outcome of a preference for marriage with a cross-cousin and spe- cifically with the FZD, result in individuals typically marrying people who speak their mother's languages, the basis of a system of widespread multilingualism. Marriages between affinally-related groups go hand-in-hand with exchanges of food and goods during ceremonial beer-feasts. Each group is traditionally associated with the manufacture of specific artefacts and ecological variations</page><page sequence="3">Tukanoan Social Organisation 97 mean that not everyone has equal access to the same resources. These material and marital exchanges integrate the different Tukanoan groups into an open- ended regional system. Horizontal affinal exchanges between different groups have their complement in the vertical or hierarchical ordering of agnatic relations within each one. Each group, descended from an anaconda ancestor, is divided into a number of clans or sibs3 ranked according to the birth order of their founding ancestors, the anaconda's sons. Members of a given sib refer to other sibs as their elder or younger brothers. In theory, each sib should live in a single communal long-house or maloca; in practice the residence group typically consists of a sib-segment or minimal lineage, a group of brothers living with their parents and their in-married wives. The maloca community is the minimal exogamic unit and residence is virilocal: on marriage, wives move in whilst sisters move out. Tukanoan life is river oriented; in theory, and to some extent in practice, sib rank is reflected in spatial organisation. Senior sibs live downstream relative to junior sibs who live towards the headwaters. Finally there are restrictions on marriage between some groups; those who do not intermarry are related as brothers and belong to vaguely-defined, un-named and dispersed phratries. In this brief sketch, I have tried to outline the way in which Tukanoan social organisation is typically characterised in the ethnographic literature, a character- isation which relies heavily on the concept of descent.4 After a brief descrip- tion of the maloca, I shall present an alternative to this male-centred, lineal view; I shall argue that Tukanoans conceptualise social relationships in two differing, complementary ways. One, corresponding to the anthropologists' descent, emphasises hierarchy and a general masculine ethos and is most salient in the context of male initiation rites. The other conceptualisation is more egalitarian, is associated with a more feminine ethos and emphasises notions of kinship and consanguinity. Though especially pertinent to daily life, it too is given ritual expression during inter-community exchange feasts. These two conceptualisations correspond to two different, gendered readings of the house as a physical structure. One reading finds echoes in the Guianas, the other in Central Brazil. When compared with most Amazonian architecture, Tukanoan malocas stand out both for their size, careful construction and elaborate decoration and for their importance as models of category systems and dynamic processes in the human and natural worlds. In his discussion of " sociétés à maison" Lévi- Strauss is concerned more with the House as form of social grouping than with houses as buildings.5 However, though there is no necessary correlation be- tween the two, the salience of the House as a social institution is frequently reflected in architectural elaboration. The physical and intellectual elaboration of their architecture is only of several reasons why it might be profitable to apply the House concept to the Tukanoans. The ownership and lineal transmission of names, titles and other ritual prero- gatives-an important aspect of the notion of House (see Lévi-Strauss 1991)-</page><page sequence="4">98 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES are also integral to the Tukanoan idioms usually glossed as descent. Indeed, it could be said that Tukanoan groups are constituted much more by such proper- ty than they are by any notions of common substance or unbroken lines of kinship through men. For Lévi-Strauss, the House is characteristic of societies in which the principle of lineage continuity is in constant interplay with that of temporary or more permanent alliance which binds two or more lineages together. This produces a new type of social unit in which "la façon dont les lignées s'entrecroisent et se nouent compte autant sinon plus que leur conti- nuité" {ibid.: 435). Christine Hugh- Jones (1979: 161 ff.) has already drawn attention to the crucial importance of names, matrilateral ties and the inter- linking of allied lineages for an understanding of group continuity in Tukanoan society. Lévi-Strauss also suggests that the House represents a form of social organisation which might be described as standing halfway between lineal and cognatic principles of social organisation, conflating and transcending principles which are normally taken to be mutually exclusive. This is clearly consistent with the two different Tukanoan conceptualisations of social relationships, one lineal, the other cognatic, projected in androgynous representations of the house. House and Community Up to thirty metres long and ten metres high, Tukanoan malocas have a palmthatch gabled roof supported on a row of paired wooden columns run- ning down the middle and on two rows of short pillars one at each side. At the sides, the roof comes down nearly to the ground; the rear, women's end forms a semi-circular apse whilst the front, men's end is square (fig. 1). On either side of the front door, the external walls are often painted with human figures and striking geometrical designs; inside, suspended above the centre, hangs a large box containing feather ornaments. The significance of these human and architectural ornaments will become clear later. The wooden house-frame is constructed by a group of men who are physically identified with the main columns. Their wives help them with the thatching, a lengthy process which has affinal connotations and often involves visiting neighbours. The man who organises the construction of a maloca becomes the leader and representative of the community who lives within; building a maloca together implies recognition of his leadership and acceptance of a particular social arrangement. The visual impact of the building - its size, decoration, and cleanliness - is a sign of the leader's standing and of the prestige and cohesion of his group. On the leader's death, he is buried in the centre of the floor, the maloca is abandoned, and the community reforms or divides. The community or "people of one house" (koho wiiãda) is made up of a group of brothers, their wives and children and their unmarried sisters. Their parents, if still alive, act as an important unifying focus. Malocas rarely contain more than thirty individuals and residential groups of half that number are more usual. The community is a compromise between unity and division,</page><page sequence="5">Tukanoan Social Organisation 99 Fig. 1. Ground-plan of Tukanoan maloca. between centrifugal and centripetal forces. The men belong to the same descent group but rules of exogamy and virilocality mean that they are divided by ties to wives belonging to other groups; each family occupies a separate compart- ment towards the rear end of the house. The men are also divided by differences in age which are reflected in behaviour and spatial organisation. The headman and owner of the house is normally the eldest brother. He is treated with a certain amount of deference and has his compartment on the right hand side furthest to the rear; the compartments of married younger brothers are further towards the front whilst both unmarried youths and guests sleep near the front door. Each family represents a potential household and, in the end, tensions between them (typically over food, sex and authority) lead to the break-up of the group.</page><page sequence="6">100 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES In everyday life differences of seniority, affinity, and familial self-interest are carefully downplayed in favour of an emphasis on unity expressed in the idioms of family, kinship and nurturance. Food production is organised by family and wives cook meat and fish brought by their husbands on the hearth inside their compartment. Though food is produced by individual men and women, much of it is consumed communally by the household as a whole and the staple manioc bread is baked on a communal hot-plate situated in the open part at the rear of the house, a place where people sit and warm themselves, a focus of gossip and casual intimacy where outsiders do not normally go. Meals are eaten near the centre of the house, a public space reserved for unifying rituals which contrasts with the compartmentalised periphery. Food sharing is crucial to the maintenance of group cohesion ; non-sharing is a sure sign of tensions and divisions. A full and proper meal, the essence of contented sociality, is made up of female-produced manioc products and male-produced fish or meat spiced with chilli-pepper, a substance which has marked sexual conno- tations.6 At formal meals, man eat before women, a further marking of gender complementarity. The meal thus presents an image of the household as a single family with the men as "husband", the women as "wife" and the children shared in common. The ideal maloca community, identified with the house it builds, is thus one that acts and thinks like a single family and outside the context of ritual, social relations are informal and egalitarian and an ideology of kinship prevails.7 Amongst predominantly uxorilocal groups elsewhere in Amazonia, ideas of community are often constructed through female kinship relations (Seymour- Smith 1991). The Tukanoans' patrilineal and patrilocal emphasis precludes this possibility. Instead, as will be seen below, we find the notion of community transposed onto the representation of a womb-like, female house. Food-Giving House Though each maloca forms an autonomous and largely indépendant community, clusters of neighbouring houses, belonging to two or more different exogamous groups, make up a territorial group with fluid and shifting boundaries defined by density of kinship ties, the frequency of visiting, reciprocal feasting and intermarriage, and by influence of shamans and other important men. Symmetrical alliance and a preference for close marriage means that, although the maloca community is exogamous, the territorial group is relatively endogamous. Brothers and sisters tend to live in neighbouring houses linked by long-standing ties of alliance so that their children marry each other. If the maloca community is like a single family, de facto the territorial group is an extended endogamous kindred, an arrangement not dissimilar to that found in the Guianas (Rivière 1984). Of course, the difference is that in</page><page sequence="7">Tukanoan Social Organisation 101 the Guiana area such endogamous territorial groups have a lower-level counter- part in the (ideally) endogamous settlement group itself (ideally) a single house- hold; despite its familial ethos, the exogamous Tukanoan settlement group is structured according to quite different principles. However, during beer feasts, endogamous Tukanoan territorial groups do come together on a temporary basis and, on such occasions, they too present themselves as if they formed a single household. Such feasts are called "houses", the house standing metonymically for the people inside. At Food-giving House (bare ekaria wii), men from a visiting maloca present their hosts and affines with smoked meat or fish and act as principle dancers in the dance that follows.8 In return the host community provides vast amounts of manioc beer which the guest must consume before leaving, if necessary vomiting to make more room. At a later date the hosts go to dance in the house of their erstwhile guests, presenting them in turn with a comple- mentary gift - fish for meat, one localised product for another. These exchanges reflect the opposed complementary and egalitarian relation- ship between af finally-related groups represented, in the context of the ritual, primarily by the men. The ritual and its associated mythology serve to underline the fact that affinal relations between communities are represented in terms of gender: the host-recipients are "female" in relation to their "male" donor- guests. The guests provide male-produced food and remain in the front men's end of the house. Their hosts provide them with female-produced manioc beer and remain towards the women's end where they receive fish or meat like women receiving their husband's catch. As the food is brought in, the donors shout obscene jokes which leave no doubt about the implied relationship between the two parties. At the start of the rite the visitors are treated very formally and keep separate from their hosts. By the end, such differences have been obliterated: hosts and guests sit together, dance together and replace formal chanting with informal banter and raucous laughter. This effacement of affinal formality parallels the transition from wife to mother as in-married women are incorporated into their husband's group. The ritual ends with a communal meal at which the smoked meat or fish, boiled in a pot, is served with home-baked manioc bread to everyone present. Here then, it is the territorial group which presents itself as a single commensal family, the guests acting as the meat-providing husband and the hosts as the bread-baking, meat-cooking wife. The image of a food-exchanging, commensal couple living their children in a single residential space generates a nested series which extends from family compartment through maloca community to the territorial group, a series whose connecting thread is marriage and reproduction. Marriage between a man and a woman creates a family in a compartment. The marriages of their sons create a maloca community which celebrates its affinal relations with neighbouring communities through food-exchange rituals. These rituals provide the context for further liaisons and marriages. As the sons have children in their turn,</page><page sequence="8">102 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES the maloca community dissolves and replicates itself anew. Like daughters of women who become mothers in their turn, each compartment represents a future house. Not surprisingly, the maloca itself is sometimes spoken about as a woman: the rounded rear of the house is her head, the front entrance is her vagina, and the cavernous interior is her womb. The House as Cosmos In myth and shamanic discourse, the nested imagery of womb and child, compartment and family, maloca and community, territory and neighbourhood group extends outwards to embrace the cosmos and humanity. The maloca itself replicates and models the structure of the cosmos: its floor is the earth and its posts are the mountains supporting the roof or sky above. Like the mountains which delineate the territories of the different Tukanoan groups, the posts define the interior space of the house and, in the right context, each may represent a different group. Down the centre of the maloca, from rear to front, west to east, runs an invisible river on whose banks and tributaries the people live. During rituals, for those who understand such things, human time merges with timeless myth and the maloca and its contents assume cosmic proportions and significance. According to the Desana creation myth9, the universe was created by a fe- male deity who covered her body with feather ornaments to form a protective house. Inside this house or * 'universe- womb", the deity created five Thunders, each in his own compartment - four at the cardinal points and a fifth suspended above the centre space (fig. 2a, 2b, 2c). Like its analogue the feather box, this fifth compartment contained feather ornaments, semen-like generative principles in male/female pairs and associated with the light of the sun (see also Reichel- Dolmatoff 1971: 48). The Thunder vomited the feathers from his body: they became proto-men and women who travelled upriver from the East inside an anaconda-canoe. A further transformation of the Thunder's body, its name - "fermentation-anaconda" or "fermentation-canoe" - evokes the canoe-like trough used for brewing manioc beer. As they travelled, the feather-people periodically stopped, went up onto the banks and danced. The anaconda's journey gave rise to the river up which it swam; its stopping places, rapids and rock outcrops along the river, are "trans- formation-houses", ancestral dwellings created by the dances of the feather-people (fig. 3). Their journey and dancing are compared to a gestation but note however that, in this mythical process, it was the things contained (anaconda-canoe, people) which gave rise to the containers (river, houses), an inversion of the normal process in which the containing womb gives rise to a contained child. When the anaconda-canoe had reached the Vaupés region, the centre of the world, the feather-people were now fully human. They disembarked at the great rapid of Ipanoré; as ancestors of the different Tukanoan groups they emerged</page><page sequence="9">1. Universe Tower-home of Bar Eagle. 2.

H.-J.)</page><page sequence="11">Tukanoan Social Organisation 105 carrying the ornaments from which they had been born, each through their own hole in the rocks of the rapid. They then dispersed to ancestral houses in their respective territories whilst the anaconda-canoe returned to its original form, the Thunder in his house in the sky. Though an order of emergence may be specified, the myth plays down hier- archy between different Tukanoan groups in favour of an equality of difference marked by different emblematic languages and items of material culture. As we shall see, this is in marked contrast to the emphasis on rank and hierarchy which applies when this myth relates the origins of one specific group. This myth clearly confirms the suggestion of the nesting series- womb-child &lt; compartment-family &lt; maloca-community &lt; territory-neighbourhood &lt; cosmos- humanity- raised above. In addition, it either states or implies a further set of equivalencies between other house-like containers: feather-box = anaconda- canoe = beer-trough; anaconda = river; rock (rapid, mountain) = ancestral house. Gestation-like processes, portrayed as travelling and dancing, take place inside these containers and culminate in movements between container and contained, inseminations and parturitions via female vaginas and male mouths. These movements are replicated during rituals; as feather ornaments are taken from their box and placed on the heads of the dancers inside the house, the dancers return to their ancestral proto-human state in a wider cosmos. Shouting jokes charged with sexual imagery, they bring in "male" meat and fish in through the door of their host's "female" house later emerging to vomit out the beer they are given in exchange. What I have tried to show so far can be summarised as follows. Although ethnographers have tended to emphasise unilineal descent, exogamy, virilocality, and the agnatic character of the residence group, this conceptualisation coexists with another which stresses affinity or alliance. If the descent model is in- extricably bound up with notions of hierarchy (see below), the alliance model, ritually expressed during ceremonial exchanges of food, gives recognition to the equal-but-different status of affinally-related maloca communities and of the groups to which they belong. Àrhem has produced a similar argument for the Tukanoan Makuna.10 Though he is far from the mark when he talks of "the pronounced dichotomy between categorical ideal and social practice, which sets the Makuna apart from other Tukano groups" (1981: 16), he is much closer when he talks of "two parallel or alternative social models, consciously elaborated and operative in particular social contexts" (ibid.: 14). Far from being a deviation from some ideal, close marriage, local endogamy, a stress on consanguinity and an ethos of family and kinship are themselves part of an alternative ideal. It is this ideal which receives expression in the final feeding stage of Food-giving House. Affinity, highlighted in the early stages of the feast, blurs into co-resident con- sanguinity in a meal which represents the gathering as a single family and house. We are thus left with two different conceptualisations of social relationships which correspond to the anthropologists' descent and consanguinity.</page><page sequence="12">106 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES Affinity, as a "between" relationship, is expressed in relational terms - in the relative placing of individuals within the house or in that of houses within a given area. Consanguinity, as a "within" relationship, receives concrete ex- pression in the womb-like interior of the maloca. Depending on context, the family contained in this womb may be the nuclear family in its compartment, the community in the maloca, the territorial group at a dance house, or the whole of humanity inside the house-as-cosmos. It remains to clarify how descent is expressed. The House of Awakening I have already given a general outline of the conventional view of Tukanoan social organisation, a combination of descent and alliance principles. Here I go slightly further into what lies behind the notion of descent. The Tukanoans are divided into a number of exogamous groups- Tukano, Desana, Barasana, Tatuyo, etc. - each with its own patrilineally-transmitted language. Each group, descended from an eponymous anaconda ancestor, owns a territory centred on a particular river or section of river, ownership being a matter of ancestral occupancy, stewardship and ritual responsibility rather than of exclusive rights. Groups are divided into one or more sets of sibs internally ranked as elder/ younger brother as if the component sibs were a group of male siblings, the sons of the anaconda father. Sets of sibs, ideally numbering five (as in the primal house), claim specialised roles as their ritual prerogatives: the top sib are chiefs followed by chanter-dancers, warriors, shamans and servants in that order; in any given area, not all these roles are necessarily represented by extant sibs. Thought this caste-like division is expressed at sib level during ritual, in daily practice it operates only at an individual level. Male children should be given a name appropriate to their birth order and linked with the ritual role which they should adopt in adult life11. In practice, the eldest brother is indeed usually the maloca headman and his younger siblings may also specialise as dancers, chanters and shamans according to seniority. It should be clear by now that the lowest order, localised descent unit, a group of co-resident, close male agnates, replicates the ancestral condition of a group of brothers born of the same anaconda father. In theory, all members of one sib should live in the same house and perhaps did so in the past; in ideal terms it matters little whether they do or not for there is a sense in which this replication means that they do so by definition. This is the force of Dumont's characterisation of a hierarchical schema quoted at the beginning of this essay. The counterpart of the nested series of family &lt; household &lt; terri- torial group &lt; humanity is the reduplication of a basic structure consisting of a father and his ranked sons which applies at any level from house through sib-segment, sib, sib-set to whole exogamic group. In myth, these are all one and the same and are rendered equivalent to one another by the transmission</page><page sequence="13">Tukanoan Social Organisation 107 Fig. 4. Five-from-one transformations. of names and by other ritual devices. They are represented by a five-from- one blueprint which can be visualised in different ways: the segmented body of an anaconda, a hand, the head and limbs of the human body, the modular constructional frame of the maloca, vines stemming from a common stock, the mid-rib and veins of a leaf, a river and its affluents, the gable and ribs of the roof, a vertebral column and ribs, or a settlement of five houses (fig. 2b and 4). Consistent with the image of a father and five sons, shallow, branching genealogies are used to determine relationships between closely related people, both living and recently dead. Beyond this, genealogies, in the sense of a suc- cession of father-son links, are but one of several "lines" (ba) which serve as umbilical links between the present and the ancestral past. We have al- ready met such lines in the form of journeys along rivers and houses strung out along their banks (fig. 3). These correspond to real-life displacements as</page><page sequence="14">108 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES succeeding generations move to different sites along the rivers leaving their dead, buried in abandoned house-sites, behind them. Vegetables lines - cuttings of coca and manioc plants placed end to end or vines with nodes or fruits at regular intervals - recall the distinctive clones of different cultivars which are trans- mitted across the generations as part of group patrimony. In the contrast be- tween stock and tip, these plant metaphors express the difference between senior and junior. Complementing the image of a nesting, englobing house, such lines figure much more prominently than genealogies as an idiom of descent. Despite what has sometimes been said (see for eg. Árhem 1981: 101; Shapiro 1987: 305), what genealogies are not used for is as a more general way of specifying orders of segmentation, a quite inappropriate rendering of the nesting image of hierarchy which slips in all too easily under the umbrella of descent. In order to complete this picture of hierarchy it is necessary to refer back to myth. When versions of the myth outlined above are used to describe the origins of a single group (rather than that of humanity in general), the anaconda is their particular ancestor-father. The myths describe how, on their journey upriver, the people concerned obtained various ceremonial goods, songs and spells. Stories of how these items were acquired complete the group's patrimony and serve both to validate their ritual prerogatives and to affirm their relation- ship to a given territory. The anaconda ends its journey in the group's ancestral river. It swims to the top and then turns round to lie with its head at the river mouth: the anaconda is, in effect, the river transformed. The rapids or "houses" which divide up the river are the stopping places of the anaconda and the preferred sites for the malocas of the different sibs. The rapid nearest the mouth is the group's "house of awakening" (yuhiri wii), the place where the anaconda vomited the ancestors of the different sibs from its body, and the place to which the souls of group members return at death. The ancestor's birth order determined both sib rank and also their placement along the river, the top ranking sib or head living at the mouth and the tail living at the headwaters. Just as the builder and owner of a maloca represents his people, so too does the head sib - stand for and encompass the rest - the names used to refer to whole phratries are often derived from those of their top-ranking sibs.12 The architectural imagery of a house of awakening, mediating between group and territory, extends to include various other landmarks. The mountains owned by the group are its house posts and other rocky ridges and rapids are its beams; the entire territory, defined and structured by these posts and beams, is thus a house with an ancestral river running down the middle; the whole group may also be referred to as the people of one house. This time, however, the house in question is no englobing feminine womb but rather a very masculine, linear anaconda. His backbone and ribs, the river and its side-streams, are the gable and ribs of the roof (fig. 4); his body patterns adorn the front walls and his completed image is painted on the main house-posts, the counterparts of his own slender form (fig. 5).</page><page sequence="15">Tukanoan Social Organisation 109 Fig. 5. Ancestral anacondas painted on Tukanoan house posts (from Koch-Grünberg 1910: 243). Each Tukanoan group owns the following prerogatives and items of wealth which represent its identity and ancestral powers: 1) feather head-dresses and ceremonial goods kept inside the feather-box; 2) a set of sacred musical instru- ments; 3) rights to make a particular item of secular material culture and rights to make and use certain items of ritual property (masks, musical instruments, etc.); 4) a complex of non-material, linguistic and musical property comprising personal names, names for ritual objects, a language, various chants, spells, songs, ins- trumental melodies, musical styles and a body of myth. The myths serve to identify and legitimate the group's ancestral powers which can be activated in the appropriate ritual setting. As I have already suggested, this is exactly the kind of property that constitutes the domain of Houses in Lévi-Strauss' sense.13</page><page sequence="16">110 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES I have deliberately left ' 'group" ill-defined for, given the hierarchical system described above, there is clearly room for considerable ambiguity as to precisely at what level - longhouse, sib, sib-set, endogamous group - the notion of House applies and ambiguity too concerning who represents whom and who owns what. In one sense this is a non-issue for the Tukanoan House is an ideal, ritual construct - which is why it has been necessary to explicate their notions of descent through recourse to the esoteric discourses of ritual, shamanism and myth. But on a more practical level, these issues, and the linked one of relative sib ranking, are the very essence of traditional Tukanoan politics. The capture of dance ornaments was once a main objective of warfare and bitter arguments still rage over questions of ritual prerogatives and over the headship of malocas, sibs and wider groupings. Demographic fluctuations, the adoption of individuals and sometimes whole sibs from one group to another, and transfers of ritual wealth by both ceremonial exchange and illicit theft and borrowing, have left a situation in which, though all subscribe to the same ideal picture, not everyone agrees as to how this ideal maps onto current reality. Despite my doubts about the generalised use of the notion of descent as a rendering for the native idioms of House, it is here that we do need to hang on to the more restricted notion of clan or sib to talk about the down-to-earth reality of the groups of people between whom marriages are negotiated and who sponsor food-exchanges and other rituals. If the Tukanoan House is pri- marily ancestor-focused, generalised and collective, real malocas and territorial groups, the latter made up of both agnatically - and af finally - related maloca communities, are focused upon specific individuals. These are typically men with large houses and many male kin, well versed in mythology and oratory and who through inheritance or other means control a box of feathers and a set of sacred flutes and trumpets. The malocas of such men become ceremonial centres for the surrounding population and the rituals they stage serve as switch points between the maloca and the House, arenas for demonstrating powers and prerogatives which set an official seal on the current constitution of political groups and on current claims to status. He House The most important of these validatory rituals is he House, a secret male initiatory cult (S. Hugh- Jones 1979). In a general sense, he refers to the ancestral state and its powers; more specifically it refers to paired flutes and trumpets made of black palm-wood (Jurupary) which represent everything ancestral in its most condensed form. They represent not only the bones of the anaconda ancestor but also the columns of the house and the surrounding mountains as well. Their names, each linked with a different column of the house (Béksta 1988: 51), are those of the ancestor and his sons, the same personal names which are owned by the group and conferred on living individuals.</page><page sequence="17">Tukanoan Social Organisation 111 The flutes and trumpets are kept underwater, dormant anacondas lying at the bottom of the river. At he House, they are taken from their hiding place and brought to the maloca. Assembled together, decked out in feather ornaments and blown to give them breath and voice, these dry black bones and brilliantly coloured hair return to life as the ancestor-father. He adopts each new generation of initiates as his sons; and these sons are given a good whipping to ensure that they grow up strong and tough. In such ritual contexts, the maloca itself assumes the human guise of this same anaconda ancestor: the front door is his mouth, the painted walls are his painted cheeks and the leaves of the roof are the feathers on his head. In one grand fusion of group, space and time, body, house and cosmos coincide, the present becomes the past, individuals become whole sibs, and the group becomes one with its ancestor. He House is the very antithesis of Food-giving House. The latter is a cooperative, egalitarian and inter-group affair; the former (ideally) brings together the whole sib, a single, male-only unit with its own particular interests, asserting its independence as it presents its painted face to the world. It is vertically oriented towards the ancestors and also intrinsically hierarchical, employing a number of ritual devices to mark out the relative standing of the people involved. The ethos of complementary nurturing which characterises Food- giving-House is likewise far removed from that of he House. No fires must be lit, no beer is served, and no food of any kind enters the maloca.14 The aftermath of the rite is characterised by a two-month long fast during which time the men avoid all contact with women. The fast is broken by a dance called The House of Manioc Bread (dahu kitiria wii) at which the missing female element is restored. Neighbouring affines are invited, the men dance with the women, and huge amounts of snowy-white bread made from pure manioc starch are distributed. People throw bits of this bread, tied together with strips of bast, up into the rafters of the house till the interior is festooned in white. If the men of the sib are the bones and framework of the house, their wives and affines provide substance, restoring its flesh in the bread they throw. This rite marks the end of the men's food taboos and the resumption of normal meals, a return to the consanguineal mode of daily life. The Androgynous House As observers we look out from inside a warm, familiar body; as actors we are those bodies. There is a similar, inherent ambiguity about any house, an ambiguity which corresponds to lived experience. A reversible topography, the house is an entity which is at once both an inside and an outside, a contained and a container, a backstage and a front stage, a home and a façade, where we live and where others come to visit us. Seen from without, the maloca is a single building and community, typically represented by men in its dealings with outsiders, and with a slightly hard but imposing feel about it which recalls</page><page sequence="18">112 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES the way these men like to present themselves in public. Experienced from within, it is divided into family compartments surrounding an open communal space. On a normal day, the interior of the house, especially the domestic space at the rear, has a relaxed, informal and slightly unkempt air about it like that of the residents at home. On ritual occasions, rules of etiquette mark a clear division between the rear women's section and that of the men in the front. This linear, gendered division corresponds to the two gendered, anthropomorphic readings of the maloca, one, focused on the interior womb, which sees it as a woman with her head to the rear, the other, focused on its external appearance and face, which sees it as a man with his head to the front. I have argued earlier that these two readings relate to two different conceptualisations of social relations. One, setting individuals and groups apart, combines internal hierarchy with outwardly-directed self-interest and represents the community as a male-dominated House. The other integrates individuals and groups, combines equality with accommodation and mutual identification, and represents the community as a nurturing womb-like family. The former corresponds to the anthropologists' descent, the latter to consanguinity. Alliance, theoretically an equal and balanced relation between Houses or communities, contains an inherent ambiguity which depends on relative point of view. Con- ceptualised in terms of gender, its male side may appear either as generous out- sider givers - the case in Food-giving between friendly affines - or as predatory insider takers - the case in bride-capture between strangers. This ambivalence, together with the fact that the loyalties of any group of brothers are threatened and divided by their ties to their wives, means that alliance often gets disguised as consanguinity. All this would appear to fit well with Lévi-Strauss' argument (1983: 187) that the explanatory strength of the notion of House lies in its capacity to integrate, in one single society and under one heading, contradictory notions which anthropologists normally use to distinguish between different social types. It would also seem to fit with his argument that the House has a fetishistic quality which serves to mask the contradictions and tensions inherent in the alliance relation (Lévi-Strauss 1987: 155 ff.). The Tukanoan House is inherently ambiguous, an ambiguity exemplified in a linear, front-to-back androgyny and reduplicated in a multitude of ambivalent lower-level pairs - paired central columns, paired flutes and trumpets, paired feather ornaments, etc. Each such pair is male and female, senior and junior, husband and wife, elder- and younger- brother and, by implication, brother and sister as well. This diametric ambiguity is given an added, concentric dimension by representing the relation between the house, its contents and its setting as a reduplicative nested series: each male inside is englobed by a female outside which is male with respect to a yet more inclusive encompassment. On a cosmic scale, the female universe house englobes the houses of the male Thunders; on a more human scale, like the maloca commu- nity surrounded by its affines, the central space with its ritual, male, conno- tations is surrounded by a more domestic, female periphery.15 In myth, births</page><page sequence="19">Tukanoan Social Organisation 113 are represented as a transition between inside and outside (see supra, p. 106) and in ritual the return to an ancestral state is also a shift from micro-cosm to macro-cosm. This brings me to a final point about bodily imagery which relates back to my discussion of descent, consanguinity and affinity. An important component of the Tukanoan conceptualisation of descent involves ideas concerning the differing contributions of the two parents to the body of their child. A child is said to derive bone from its father's semen; semen and name also contribute to the child's soul (isi). Like the house posts, rocks and mountains with which they are associated, these male-derived components are hard, permanent and endure through time; they contrast with the more ephemeral, maternally derived flesh and blood which surrounds the bone. Initiation severs a young man's childhood ties to his mother and he begins to assert adult independence. He wears feather ornaments for the first time. These feathers, also aspects of soul, are like visible counterpart of his names: as he begins to wear them, the names of his childhood go underground and are no longer used in public. Though they are derived from his father's House, names and feathers are conferred by people other than his father- a shaman in the case of names, shamans assisted by affinal god- fathers {basori, übari; S. Hugh- Jones 1979) in the case of feathers. Bone and blood have to do with physical being; names and feathers with a man's social being. Secret names represent inner strength whilst the feathers and other ornaments are his public face. In marriage, men and women from affinally-related groups become more like kin via their children who are created from their complementary sub- stances - the teknonymy they use between each other underscores this point. Family and kinship is the daily ethos of the maloca community. At initiation, the prelude to their politico-ritual life, male children are incorporated into an ancestral House via a ritual process of adoption and at death their souls return to this House, embodied in a stone house of awakening. The maloca itself undergoes a similar kind of process. Its columns and frame, the bones of the house, are erected by the men. They are given substance by the residents and clothed in a roof of feather-like leaves contributed by wives and affines. Abandoned by its people, the maloca dies along with its owner. Roof and walls rot away leaving the heavy handwood columns, standing like bleached bones on a site full of memories, the histories of its residents. Conclusion For Lévi-Strauss (1987: 153 ff.), the House concept applies, in particular, to cognatic systems such as those found in Southeast Asia. Such systems lack positive marriage rules and thus lie beyond or on the far side of the elementary structures. The cognatic systems of Amazonia, where symmetric alliance is</page><page sequence="20">114 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES the norm, appear to be of a quite different order. With no lineages or sections to provide a global logic, they represent the internal limits of restricted ex- change, truly elementary structures which are reduced to cousin-marriage within the kindred and ordered by a logic of ego-centred kin terms. Thus by definition they cannot be House societies in Lévi-Strauss' terms (Viveiros de Castro 1993). For the cognatic groups such as those of the Guianas, the notion of House would appear to add little to the stress on co-residence whose significance was appreciated long ago (Rivière 1984). It is only in their ideas concerning mythical stone houses that we find some approximation to the real thing. I have argued above that, as an ongoing group formed around the possession of sacra and other ritual prerogatives, Lévi-Strauss' original definition of the House (1983: 174) applies to the Tukanoans and I have been content to treat it as roughly equivalent to the anthropologists' exogamous language group, an idealised projection of lower order sibs. However, to leave it like this would be to distort some of Lévi-Strauss' subsequent ideas on the subject. In real life, property is controlled not by ancestral Houses but by sibs or sib-segments forming the cores of communities which often present themselves in a quite different guise. Lévi-Strauss (1987: 156) later describes the House as an "institution which [. . .] owes its existence neither to descent, property or residence as such, but as a projection of a relation capable of manifesting in one or more of these illusory forms". The relation concerned, one that is inherently unstable and strained, is that of affinity which is objectified and given solidity in the illusory from of the house (ibid,: 155). Affinity, involving as it does the contradiction between self-sufficiency and dependence on others, might be described as the problem underlying the Dravidian systems of Amazonia. By opting for an endogamous solution and doing away with affinity by disguising it as consanguineal co-residence, groups in the Guianas have opted for a peaceful life. The cost is a weakly-integrated, atomistic society made up of small, inward looking and impermanent commu- nities each in a single communal dwelling. Here there is no room for more than one projection of the House - a building which is at once family, hearth and home. But those cold, hard mountains, the houses of the ancestral spirits, still loom through the clouds above the forest canopy. In them we may even find ancestral clans and moieties, shadowy reflections of their Tukanoan counter- parts (Overing Kaplan 1981: 162). The Tukanoans have opted for a less restful but more powerful solu- tion. Exploiting the possibilities of lineage and hierarchy, they have generated what are potentially relatively large, internally differentiated groupings, formed round hierarchically-organised agnatic cores linked together into an open-ended regional system based on the exchange of women and goods. The cost is to bring the problem of affinity right to the forefront. The solution consists of a number of differing ceremonial gatherings, each called a "house", each reinforcing a different facet of the system, and each refracting a partial image of the constitution of society onto the buildings in which they take place. Here</page><page sequence="21">Tukanoan Social Organisation 115 affinity is both a relation between Houses and disguised as consanguinity within an encompassing House. The organic solidarity of the Tukanoans, though highly ritualised, nonetheless rests upon down-to-earth alliance. In Central Brazil, amongst the Mëbengokre (Kayapó) and other Gê groups (Lea 1992, n.d.), affinity all but disappears. Soli- darity between Houses gets shifted further towards the symbolic realm, a shift reflected in a shift in the significance of architecture. In many way, features of the Mëbengokre seem to correspond, in an inverted term-by-term fashion, to those of the Tukanoans. Here I will focus only on those that relate buildings to social groups and categories. In both cases Houses own very similar kinds of material and non-material wealth. The ritual property of different Tukanoan Houses looks very much the same; distinctions are made primarily at the verbal level of myth. Amongst the Mëbengokre, raw materials are owned by different Houses and there is a proliferation of different ornament types, a proliferation which seems to correspond to a proliferation of personal names. Each individual Tukanoan has only a " spirit name" and one or two nicknames; spirit names are conferred by living members of the proximal generation but the names themselves are those of dead paternal grandparents. In the Mëbengokre case, names are conferred by a name-giver and pass typically from MB to ZS and FZ to BD, but the relation between eponym and name receiver is assimilated to that between grandparent and grandchild. The Mëbengokre live in nucleated, circular settlements made up of uxorilocal extended family houses built in fixed places round a central plaza and men's house. Each Tukanoan phratry or sib-set lives in a number of virilocal extended family houses arranged in dispersed, linear settlements with places fixed according to sib rank along the banks of a single river. In each case, correspondence be- tween ideal and actual settlements is always incomplete but all settlements represent an ideal in which all the Houses, each in a fixed position, are there by definition. Though superficially quite distinct, the overall plan of a Mëbengokre village show interesting parallels with that of a Tukanoan maloca. Inside the maloca we find a semi-circular arrangement of nuclear family compartments behind a central ritual forefront and a more general concentric dualism which opposes a masculine ritual centre to a feminine domestic periphery. In the Mëbengokre village, the concentric predominates over the linear; though a few Tukanoan malocas are also circular, most represent a compromise between the concentric and the linear, a rectangular structure with a rounded apse (C. Hugh- Jones 1979). However, the Mëbengokre and other Gê exploit linear features in various forms of diametric dualism and the Tukanoans also represent their ideal settle- ment in concentric terms as four malocas surrounding a fifth shamanic and ritual centre (see fig. 2a). The Tukanoan dwelling represents a human body and allows for several different symbolic readings; although the Mëbengokre dwelling appears to lack symbolic elaboration, it reappears one level up in a village which also represents a human body. In some Gê groups, concentric and linear readings of the village are associated with different moiety groupings</page><page sequence="22">116 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES which combine to generate an intense organic solidarity in which affinity, the main- stay of Tukanoan organic solidarity, plays no part (see also Melatti 1979). In this essay I have tried to show how the concept of House might provide fresh insight into Amazonian social organisation. Rather than use this concept to construct ' 'House society" as a new, hybrid and over-stretched social type, I would employ it as a heuristic device which, along with others, may allow us to get away from such types altogether. If categories such as Dravidian and Crow/ Omaha, cognatic and unilineal appear to separate and to fragment, a focus on houses and the House reaffirms that the societies of the Guiana region, the Tukano- ans and the Gê all inhabit the same geographic and cultural space. The advantage of a focus on the House lies in its being a category shared between different societies but differently nuanced in each one. If architecture itself plays only a minor role in Lévi-Strauss' discussion of House societies I have tried to show that his House concept may fruitfully re-direct our attention to the relation between buildings, groups and categories. According to Lévi-Strauss "la formule de la maison traduit un état où les intérêts politiques et économiques, qui tendent à envahir le champ social, empruntent encore le langage de la parenté mais doivent en même temps le subver- tir" (1991: 435-436). There is also often a clear correlation between House so- cieties and hierarchy, a correlation which is evident in the case of the Tukanoans' ranked sibs. At a higher level, the whole of Tukanoan society may be divided into senior, junior and servant classes. Each class refers to the others in terms of kinship: seniors are grandchildren, juniors are father's brothers and servants are grandfathers (Chernela 1983). The Tukanoans' kübu or priests, distinguished from the more typical Amazonian shaman as the keepers of an elaborate mythological canon, adds a further dimension to this hierarchy. Tantalising historical accounts suggest that these priests once acted in consort with powerful chiefs as the leaders of quite large political groupings (see S. Hugh- Jones n.d.b.). Lévi-Strauss (1973: 272) once suggested that the myths of Northwest Amazonia were testimony to a "genuine civilisation (with) a much higher level of religious, social and political organisation than anything that has been observed since' ' . More recently, archaeological research in the lower Amazon region has uncovered the existence of large urbanised populations which require a complete re-evaluation of our view of the region as a whole (Roosevelt 1991). The Tukanoans' origin myths speak of their migration from the Milk River down- stream in the East and their concept of House is always contextually defined - like the reflections in a mirrored hall, its nested imagery recedes outwards to encompass ever wider groupings. Lévi-Strauss (1963: 117) warns us that "a cracked bell, alone surviving the work of time, will never give forth the ring of bygone harmonies". Nevertheless it is just possible that, in such tarnished silvering, we can still discern the shadows of a past grandeur.

Based on some 30 months of field research, carried out at various times between 1968 and 1991 by C. and S. Hugh- Jones, and variously supported by the Social Science Research Council (now ESRC), King's College, Cambridge, the British Museum, and Central Television. This support is gratefully acknowledged. 3. The terms clan or sib could be used interchangeably in this context. However, as sib has become deeply embedded in the ethnographic literature on NW Amazonia, I use it in preference to clan. 4. See for example Ârhem 1981; Goldman 1963; C. Hugh- Jones 1979; Jackson 1983; and Reichel- DOLMATOFF 1971. 5. For clarity, I shall use "House" for social group and "house" or "maloca" for building. 6. See also C. Hugh- Jones 1979 and S. Hugh- Jones n.d.a. 7. Under normal circumstances, men and women treat the children of co-resident adults more or less as their own and call them "son" and "daughter". Everyone in the same house is affected by snake bite and all must take precautions to avoid making the victim's condition worse. Orphaned girls from other groups who have been brought up with their male cross-cousins are not considered suitable as sexual partners or spouses. Finally, by using tecknonymy, husbands and wives avoid reference to each other's names or affinal status and instead affirm a bond created through their children, a bond also manifest in "couvade" res- trictions which apply to men before and after the birth of their children. These and other aspects of behaviour all suggest links of common substance between the members of one household. 8. Items of materials culture traditionally associated with different exogamic groups may also be ex- changed and in a more elaborate version of the rite, the exchange of feather ornaments and other ritual possessions links the two groups as "ancestral affines" (he teyia). 9. Condensed from Umúsin Panlõn Kumu and Tolamãn Kenhíri 1980: 51-70. 10. Àrhem (1981: 196-197) states that food-exchange forms part of "an alliance-based cosmological model or conception of society, complementary to, but distinct from, the descent-based conception of society" and that "the ideology of marriage exchange is concerned with the symmetric exchange relationship between affinally-related groups of men as a relationship between 'unlike equals' ". Where I disagree is in his suggestion that, because of their statistical tendency towards linguistic and local endogamy (Àrhem 1989: 12), the Makuna are in any way anomalous with respect to other Tukanoan groups. The issue of 'linguistic endogamy' is a red herring (see Gómez &amp; Hugh- Jones n.d.). As to the statistical tendency towards endogamy, this certainly applies to the Makunas' neighbours and probably to the other Tukanoans too. 11. See also Àrhem 1981: 112. fn 6. 12. The Tatuyo are a case in point. The group name Tatuyo comes from the Lingua Geral tatú tapuyo or "armadillo people" itself derived from Pãboa, also "armadillo people", the name of the top- ranking Tatuyo sib. 13. This set of material and non-material property bears a striking resemblance to that found amongst the Bororó and Gê-speaking of Central Brazil (see for eg. Crocker 1985). In a recent paper, Lea (1992) has argued that groups owning and transmitting such property amongst the Mëbengokre (Kayapó) also constitute Houses. 14. During preliminary rites, forest fruits, often supplied as tribute by dependant (and by implication, lower-ranking) agnatic communities, are brought into the house accompanied by flutes and trumpets referred to as birds. Instead of acting as predatory fish or meat eaters - with the inevitable implications of exchange in trade, war, or marriage - the community now adopts an avian mode, feasting on the ripe fruits which are redistributed at the end of the rite. Fruit has connotations of independence and incompleteness: unlike fish and meat which is always eaten in company and accompanied by manioc bread, fruit is typically a snack food and may be eaten alone and on its own (S. Hugh- Jones n.d.a). 15. Tukanoans use the inherent hierarchy of concentric dualism to encode the relations between senior and junior. The topmost sib is both head and centre with respect to the rest and in rituals, senior men stand centrally relative to their juniors.</page><page sequence="24">118 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES REFERENCES Àrhem, K. 1981 Makuna Social Organisation.

Un réexamen de l'organisation sociale tukano. - Les Tukano du nord-ouest amazonien sont généralement caractérisés par la division en groupes patrilinéaires unis par des relations de mariage, chaque unité étant à son tour subdivisée en clans ou phratries hiérarchisés. L'article montre que la notion de « société à maison » offre une traduction plus satisfaisante des conceptions tukano que celle d 'unifiliation. Les rapports sociaux sont représentés de deux manières distinctes et complémentaires. L'une, privilégiant la hiérarchie et l'exclusion, est pertinente surtout dans les contextes mythologiques et rituels. L'autre, plus égalitaire et inclusive, sou- ligne la consanguinité et concerne davantage la vie quotidienne. Chacune correspond à une projection, distincte selon le sexe, de la maison comme structure physique. Dans cette optique, les parallèles avec l'aire guyanaise et le Brésil central apparaissent clairement.</page><page sequence="26">120 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES RESUMEN Stephen Hugh- Jones, ¿ Unificación clara o casas ambiguas?
