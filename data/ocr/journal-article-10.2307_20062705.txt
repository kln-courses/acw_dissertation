September, 1945.</page><page sequence="3">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research INTRODUCTION In 1915, exactly thirty years ago, Stephen Langdon published the text and translation of a Sumerian myth which he entitled " Sumerian Epic of Paradise, the Flood, and the Fall of Man." * The publication aroused the keen interest of Orientalists, particularly of cuneiformists, and in the course of the vnext several years a number of studies were devoted to the myth." In general scholars agreed that Langdon's translation of the Sumerian text was most untrustworthy, and his interpretation of its con tents, altogether unjustified. The poem, they pointed out, had nothing to do with paradise, did not mention the flood, and said nothing about the fall of man. But it proved to be one thing to expose the errors in Langdon's trans lation and interpretation of the poem, and quite another to present a new and trustworthy rendering of its contents. Indeed, except for the elimina tion of his more obviously exaggerated claims, the translations attempted by the various cuneiformists were almost as unfounded and misleading as that of Langdon.3 And unfortunately two translations of the myth, both very largely erroneous, have now found their way into two hand books prepared for the more general student of religion and mythology.4 The potential dangers in their indiscriminate use by students and teachers who are not in a position to evaluate the trustworthiness of their contents are readily apparent, and it is hoped that the new translation in the pages to follow will serve to reduce them to a minimum. What are the major factors responsible for the largely unproductive efforts of earlier cuneiformists, and what makes it now possible to present a trustworthy rendering of the poem? First, of course, there are the expected linguistic problems/' As a result of the recent progress in our understanding of Sumerian grammar and vocabulary, the meaning of a number of key lines, hitherto obscure or completely misinterpreted, has become intelligible. Then there is the matter of lacunae. These come at 1 PUS X 1. The text is inscribed on a six-column tablet in the University Museum, which was excavated at Nippur almost half a century ago. For details concerning the group of Sumerian literary inscriptions to which this tablet belongs, cf. SA? 1-25. Note, however, that in view of the new low chronology proposed by Smith and Albright on the basis of more recent archaeological and inscriptional evidence (cf. HA?OR 88. 28 if. ) the date there assigned to them is too high. For the present it will be best to ascribe them in more general terms to the first half of the second millennium B. C., with the probability that the majority were actually inscribed in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. 2 For a detailed bibliography, cf. Ernst F. Weidner, Die Assyriologie 1914-1922, Nos. 984-1012. ' The most valuable study is that of Morris Jastrow, " Sumerian Myths of Begin nings " (AJSL 33.89-144), primarily because it includes a considerable number of corrected sign readings collected by Edward Ohiera, who had made a careful colla tion of the tablet in the museum. 4 Cf. MRS 193-202; AB 337-343. 5 As for Langdon's miscopied signs, fortunately his publication included a good photograph of the tablet, so that, except in the case of the right and lower edges of the tablet, the conscientious translator was in a position to rectify most of the miscopies. In addition, after the appearance of Jastrow's study (cf. note 3), Chiera's excellent collation was available. 3</page><page sequence="4">Supplementary Studies No. 1 several crucial points in the text and make the context difficult to follow. Now, part of one of the more important of these lacunae can be filled in from a duplicate tablet inscribed with an extract of the poem which is at present in the Louvre; it was copied by the French Orientalist Henri de Genouillac who published it in 1930.6 But what proved to be of greatest value in the reconstruction of the text of our myth and in the intrepretation of its contents?and this is where the efforts of the earlier scholars were least productive?was the effective utilization of the clues and guides afforded by the numerous repeated passages scattered through out the poem. It is this which made possible the restoration of a number of broken passages and thus provided a much clearer insight into the structure of the composition as a whole.7 I need hardly add that the text of our myth is still far from complete, and that, as the only too numerous italicized passages in the translation show, its interpretation is still far from perfect. Nevertheless it is fairly safe to say that future discoveries will be restricted largely to the clarification of details, particularly their implication in, and significance for, the wider context of Sumerian mythology. As for the structure of the myth and the plot of its action, these will stand basically as here given. Let us turn now to the contents of the poem which I have entitled Enki and Ninhursag: A Sumerian " Paradise " Myth.8 It begins with a eulogy of Dilmun, described in the poem as both a " land " and a " city," where the action of the story takes place.9 This Dilmun, according to our poem, is a place that is pure, clean, and bright (lines 1-13). It is a land in which there is probably neither sickness nor death (lines 14-30) .10 It is a city which, by the command of Enki, the Sumerian water-god, is full of sweet water and of crop-bearing fields and farms, and is known as " the house of the banks (?) and (?) quays of ' the land ' "X1 (lines 31-64) .12 Following a brief passage which may contain a description in anthrop morphic terms of the poet's notion of the formation of the marshlands 8 Cf. TRS 62. The Louvre piece is a fragment of a one-column tablet containing an extract from the middle of our poem ; it has so many variants that it is no small credit to Edward Chiera to have been the first to recognize it as a duplicate (cf. JAOS 54.417). And as for actually fitting its contents within the framework of the poem, this proved so difficult a matter that it was not until relatively recently and only after a number of vain efforts that the solution came to hand (cf. the comment to lines 109-127 and especially notes 55-03). 7 For other poems whose repetition pattern proved of very considerable help to the reconstruction of their texts, cf. SM 31, and especially 116, note 67. 8 Cf. SM 54-59, and please note carefully that the translations there given are based on an earlier draft, and are to be modified in accordance with the present scientific edition of the poem. 9 For a detailed discussion of Dilmun and its location, cf. mv "Dilmun: The Land of the Living" in BA80R 96. 18-28. 10 In the interpretation of this particular passage, Langdon, in spite of his nu merous mistranslations, was probably closer to the truth than his critics; cf. com ment to lines 13-30. 11 The meaning of the phrase is obscure. If "the land" (Sumerian kalam) refers, as it usually does to Sumer, the implication seems to be that at one time Dilmun was conceived as part of Sumer. 12 Note that lines 42-52 and 53-64 contain the first example of the repetition that proved so helpful to the reconstruction of the text. 4</page><page sequence="5">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research in the neighborhood of the deltas bordering on the Persian Gulf (lines 05-72), the main action begins. Enki impregnates the goddess Ninhursag " the mother of ' the land '," who after nine days of pregnancy gives birth, without pain or effort, to the goddess Ninmu 1:-'R (lines 73-88) . Enki then proceeds to impregnate his daughter Ninmu 13 who, in the same wray as her mother Ninhursag, gives birth to a goddess named Ninkurra13a (lines 89-108) . Enki then impregnates his granddaughter Ninkurra, and the latter gives birth to the goddess Uttu (lines 109-127) .14 Enki is now evidently all set to impregnate his great-granddaughter Uttu, when Ninhursag, the great grandmother, intervenes and offers the latter some pertinent advice. Unfortunately the relevant passage (lines 128-152) is almost completely destroyed. But to judge from the passage that follows (lines 153-185), Uttu may have been instructed by Ninhursag not to cohabit with Enki until and unless he brings her a gift of cucumbers, apples (?), and grapes. Be that as it may, we next see Enki obtain the cucumbers, apples (?), and grapes from a gardener who probably brought them to him in gratitude for his watering the ditches, canals, and un cultivated places (lines 153-167) .ir* He (i.e. Enki) brings them to Uttu as a gift, and the latter now jovfully receives his advances and cohabits with him (lines 168-185) .16 But of this union, probably no new goddess is born.17 Instead, Ninhursag seems to utilize Enki's semen in a way which leads to the sprouting of eight different plants: the " tree "-plant, the " honey "-plant, the road weed (?) -plant, the a pa s ab. -plant, the thorn (?) -plant, the caper (?)-plant, a plant whose name is illegible, and the cassia-plant (lines 186-195). And now comes Enki's sinful deed. As he looked about him in the marshland, he noticed the eight plants and determined to decide their fate. But first, no doubt, he had to "know(?)" their " heart," that is, he probably had to taste what they are like. And so his messenger, the two-faced god Isimud, plucks each of the eight plants for Enki, and the latter eats them one by one (lines 196-217) .1S Angered by this act, Ninhursag, the goddess who is largely responsible for their first coming into existence, utters a curse against Enki, saying that until he dies she will not look upon him with the " eye of life." And, as good as her word, she immediately disappears (218-219). Whereupon Enki no doubt begins to pine away, and the Anunnaki, 12a For the reading N i n m u instead of the traditional N i n s a r , cf. comment to line 88. 13 The poem gives no clue to the time, if any, that is supposed to have elapsed between the birth of Ninmu and her impregnation by Enki. isa Yor this longer transliteration of the name, cf. comment to line 108. 14 These three passages (lines 73-88, 89-108, 109-27) again illustrate the repetition pattern which has clarified their otherwise obscure contents. For the impregnation of a fourth deity preceding the birth of uttu, cf. note 55. 15 The presence of the gardener is not to be taken as an indication that our myth deals in any way with human beings; the gardener is no doubt to be considered as one of the host of minor deities in charge of a particular activity in the service of the gods. 16 Here again note the repetition pattern in lines 148-150, 1G2-164, 1G5-1C7, 175-177. 17 Cf. comment to lines 179-87 for the uncertainties involved. 18 Note the repetition pattern in lines 188-195 and 199-217 which makes possible the restoration of seven of the eight plant names. 5</page><page sequence="6">Supplementary Studies No. 1 the great Sumerian gods sit in the dust. Enlil, the king of all the gods, seems unable to cope with the situation, when the fox VJ breaks in with the statement that if properly rewarded he will bring Ninhursag back to the gods. Enlil promises, and names his reward, and the fox proves that his words were no idle boast; in one way or another he does succeed in having Ninhursag return to the gods (221-249) .20 Ninhursag then seats the dying Enki by(?)21 her vulva, and asks where he feels pain. Enki names an organ of the body which hurts him, and Ninhursag then in forms him that she has caused a certain deity to be born for him, the implication being that the birth of the deity will result in the healing of the sick member.2- All in all Ninhursag repeats the question eight times. Each time Enki names an organ of the body that pains him, and in each case Ninhursag announces the birth of a corresponding deity (lines 250-268) .23 Finally, probably at the request of Ninhursag, Enki decreed the fates of the new born deities (269-end) . So much for the contents of our poem. The story is well-nigh complete, and at least on the surface the details of its plot are quite clear. Enki, 10 At least in Dilmun, therefore, which may be characterized as a divine paradise (cf. note 28), some animals were conceived as existing at the time wiien the action of our myth is supposed to take place. 20 Lines 229-249 are badly mutilated, and we know almost nothing of the acts which led to Ninhur sag's return. 21 Cf. comment to line 250. 22 From the contents of line 250 we might have surmised that this deity and the seven named in the lines that follow, were all born of the actual sexual union between Enki and Ninhursag, and perhaps this possibility is not to be ruled out altogether. Against this conclusion, however, is the fact that while the data gathered from sources other than our poem, all tend to show Enki to be the father of these deities, this does not seem to be true for Ninhursag as their mother. Thus in the case of the three deities for which we have pertinent data, i.e. Abu, Ninkasi, and probably Nazi (under the assumption that Nazi is simply a variant of Na(n)se; cf. note 72), all are actually stated to be the children of Enki ; cf. SBH 137. 49 (d a b - ? - d u m u - nun-na, "Abu, the son of the prince [i.e. Enki] ") ; TRS 20.9, 11 = VS X 15G 5,7: a - a - z u den-ki e n - d n u - d ? m - m u d - e , " Thy father ( O Ninkasi ) is Enki, the lord Nudimmud"; Pantheon 2749. As for the mother, we have pertinent data only for Ninkasi, and in this case, the mother is named explicitly as Ninti, queen of the Abzu (probably not to be identified with our Ninti of lines 260 and 270; cf. comment to line 266) ; cf. TRS 20. 10, 12 (= VS X 156.4, 6). Now Ninti, as is well known, is given in the god-lists as another name for Enki's wife, Damgal nunna, and it, therefore, seems unlikely that she is to be identified with Ninhursag, one of the four leading deities of the Sumerian pantheon. (Note, too, that Ninhursag is mentioned in lines 2 and 4 of the Ninkasi hymn TRS 20 [= VS X 156] w7hich probably read: dn i n -h ur - s a g - g ? - k e4 m i - z i - d ? - [e s - d ug4 - g a ], " [O Ninkasi] ever cherished of Ninhursag"; this line, too, is inconclusive for our problem.) Finally, against the surmise that the eight deities were born of an actual sexual union between Enki and Ninhursag, are these twro facts : ( 1 ) the dying Enki was probably in no condition for a sexual orgy; (2) our text makes no mention of any actual impregnation such as is described in considerable detail in the case of the birth of the goddesses Ninmu, Ninkurra, and Uttu. At present, therefore, it seems safest to translate the immarantud of lines 253, 258, etc. by the non committal " I have caused to be born for thee." 23 As already pointed out by Jastrow (cf. note 3), eight, the number of Enki's sick organs, corresponds to the number of plants which he had eaten. As for the correspondence between the sick member and the healing deity, there is nothing intrinsic or organic in the relationship; it rests on the superficial and pun-like etymologizing of the ancient scribes in that the Sumerian word for the sick organ contains at least one syllable in common with the name of the deity. 6</page><page sequence="7">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research the great god who has made Dilmun a land outstanding for its fruitful ness, probably forms the marshlands about the Persian Gulf, and then proceeds to impregnate in turn Ninhursag, her offspring Ninmu, and Ninmu's offspring Ninkurra. He also impregnates Ninkurra's offspring Uttu, but only after first presenting her with cucumbers, apples (?) and grapes. From this union it is probably Ninhursag who causes eight plants to sprout. Enki eats up the plants, and Ninhursag pronounces upon him a fatal curse. She disappears, but returns through the efforts of the fox, and as a result of the birth of eight deities she brings about the cure of the eight sick organs of Enki's body. But what is the meaning behind all this mythological patter? What natural events, what physical and cosmic forces is the poet aiming to portray in the seemingly crude sym bolism of the incidents which lie has plotted? True, some of the details may be attributed to fanciful improvisation essential to the telling of a good, connected story. But there is little doubt that by and large the poet is translating into mythological language the results of his con templation and speculation on certain natural phenomena involved in the agricultural life about him. In the introductory motifs, for example, we find lines 41-64 describing the sun-god's watering of Dilmun with fresh water brought up from the earth at the behest of Enki who personified the salt sea-water as well as the fresh river-water. While the passage is far from intelligible, it cer tainly seems to contain an attempted explanation of the no doubt far famed fertility of Dilmun's soil. Again the passage contained in lines 61-72 may, as has already been noted, represent the poet's theorizing over the formation of the marshlands bordering on the Persian Gulf.-4 Coming now to the main action, the bringing into existence, probably by Ninhursag, of the eight plants, the first step in the process, which con sists of the impregnation of Ninhursag by Enki, may perhaps symbolize the union of water and earth -5 without which plant life is inconceivable. But from this point on it seems impossible to penetrate the thoughts of our poet, or to follow the reasons for the selection of his motifs. Thus, to list only the more obvious difficulties, why did he find it necessary to bring in the birth of the goddesses Ninmu, Ninkurra and Uttu?26 What is involved in the business of the cucumbers, apples (?) and grapes? Why eight plants, and why these particular eight plants? What is sym 24 Note that while the passage seems to describe Enki's flooding of the ditches and reeds before (?) Nintu (i.e. Ninhursag), it does not seem to state that the latter receives the semen into her womb. It is just barely possible, therefore, that Enki is described in this passage as masturbating. If so, the poet may be translating into anthropomorphic terms the unnatural and unfruitful flooding action of the Persian Gulf (i.e. Enki) to which he ascribed the formation of the bleak and dreary marshlands. 25 For the possibility that Ninhursag was more originally the goddess Ki, " Earth," cf. SM 41. 20 It is of interest to note that at least two of the deities were related in some way to vegetation; these are Ninmu (cf. comment to line 88), and especially Uttu (cf. SM 72). As for the goddess Ninkurra (note that one of its obvious etymologies " Lady of the Nether World " is almost identical with that of Ereskigal, the Queen of the Nether World, although as far as we know these are two distinct deities), her activities seem to be restricted to stone-working, cf. especially the references in SAI 8474). Her presence in our vegetation myth therefore seems doubly obscure. (</page><page sequence="8">Supplementary Studies No. 1 bolized by Enki's eating of the plants, by Ninhursag's curse, by the fox's cunning acts? Just how were Enki's eight aching organs healed as a result of the birth of the eight deities? As already noted, the relationship between each sick organ and its healing deity is based on nothing more than the verbal correspondence involved in their respective names (cf. note 23). It would therefore be illuminating to know which came first in the poet's mind, the names of the organs or the names of the deities? Finally, in the very last passage, what motivated the poet's selection of the particular fate-decrees ascribed by him to the god Enki? -7 With our present limited knowledge of the wider Sumerian mythological context we are hardly in a position to answer these questions effectively, or perhaps even discuss them constructively. Let us conclude our introduction with a comparative analysis of those motifs in our poem which have, or at least seem to have, parallels in the Biblical paradise story as told in the second and third chapters of the Book of Genesis.-8 Thus Utu's watering of Dilmun with fresh water brought up from the earth is reminiscent of the Biblical " But there went up an '?d -8a from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground " (Genesis II 6) . The birth of the goddesses Ninmu, Ninkurra, and Uttu, which our poem stresses as having taken place without pain or travail, illuminates the background of the curse against Eve who is to conceive and bear children in sorrow. And obviously enough, Enki's eating of the eight plants,and the curse uttered against him by Ninhursag recall the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge by Adam and Eve and the resulting curses.-*b But perhaps the most interesting result of this comparative study of 27 Only Enki's decree that Ensag should be lord of Dilmun (line 277) seems to have any clear bearing on our myth whose action takes place in Dilmun. 28 That Dilmun was considered by the Sumerians as a divine paradise is indicated not only by the general tone of the contents of our poem but also by the fact that it was the land to which the immortalized flood-hero Ziusudra was transferred, (cf. BASOR 90. 18 ff.), as well as a land that probably knew neither death nor sickness (cf. lines 13-30). Note also that the contents of lines 59-04 points in the same direction. And it is not irrelevant to point out that there is good reason for believing that to the Babylonians, too, Dilmun was at least a " land of the living"; whether they also placed a divine garden there, which in itself seems not unlikely, it is impossible to say from our present evidence (cf. JAOS 04. 18, note 82, where the evidence is inconclusive). As for the location of the Biblical Garden of Eden, we have of course no positive proof whatever that it, too, is to be sought in Dilmun. Nevertheless it is worth noting that the topographic description in Genesis II 8-14 seems to agree with the geographic location of Dilmun (probably in southwestern Persia near the Persian Gulf, cf. BASOR 90. 18fi\), as closely as'it does with that of any of the other places suggested by the numerous scholars who have dealt with the question, cf. e.g. Albright's r?sum? and discussion in AJSL 39. 15-31. 28a Cf. now Albright, JBL 58. 102, note 25. 28b In addition to the parallels to Genesis II and III outlined above, it is not without significance to note that at least from the point of view of literary form, lines 42-04 of our poem find their parallel in Genesis I. Thus Enki, not unlike Elohim, issues his commands with a " Let . . . ." Again, the repeating patterns in Genesis I, and more especially verges 11-12, parallel that of our lines 42-52 = 53-04. Even the Hebrew phrase wayyeM ken finds its almost exact counterpart in the Sumerian h ur h ? - n a - n a m - m a of line 04, except that in accordance with the principles of Sumerian word order, the latter follows the repeated passage describing the fulfillment of the command, while the corresponding Biblical phrase precedes it. 8</page><page sequence="9">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research our Sumerian poem is the explanation which it provides for one of the most puzzling motifs in the Biblical paradise story, the famous passage describing the fashioning of Eve, " the mother of all living," from the rib of Adam. For why a rib? Why did the Hebrew story-teller find it more fitting to choose, a rib rather than any other of the body-organs for the fashioning of woman whose name, haioioah, according to the Biblical idea, means approximately " she who makes live." The reason becomes clear if we assume a Sumerian literary background, such as that represented by our Dilmun poem, underlying the Biblical paradise story.L!) For in our Sumerian poem we find that one of Enki's sick organs is the rib (lines 265-6). Now the Sumerian word for " rib " is t i. The goddess whose birth in some way implied the healing of the rib, was called, therefore, (l n i n -1 i which can mean " the Lady of the rib." But the same Sumerian word t i also means " to make live." -"* The name d n i n -1 i may there fore also be rendered " the Lady who makes live." In Sumerian litera ture, therefore, " the Lady of the rib " came to be identified with " the Lady who makes live " through what may be termed a play on words. It was this, one of the most ancient examples of paronomasia, which was probably carried over and perpetuated in the Biblical paradise story, although here, of course, it loses its validity, since in Hebrew the word for " rib " and that for " to make live " have nothing in common.30 29 This is not to say, of course, that the Sumerian material was the immediate predecessor of the Biblical story; the Hebrew writer, obviously enough, may have built on Babylonian, Canaanite, or other sources which had borrowed, modified, and molded the original motif. 28a So first P?re Scheil, Comptes Rendus, 1915, 534 f., as Albright has pointed out to me. 80 The same holds true, of course, for the language of whatever peoples may have preceded the Hebrews in the borrowing of the " rib " motif. 9</page><page sequence="10">Supplementary Studies No. 1 TRANSLITERATION * 1.

As for the terms " pure," " clean," and " bright," the general sense is obvious enough, but the possible nuances intended by the author are not easy to fathom. Lines 7-12. In lines 7 and 10 which are identical, the implications of " by him self " are not clear, nor is the force of the ? of the verbal form readily apparent (cf. perhaps QSG ?426). The translation treats the two lines as a parenthetical description of Enki introductory to the contents of lines 8-9 and 11-12 respectively. In line 7, note the omission of k u r before dilmun ; this is true wherever dilmun is mentioned in the rest of the poem. In line 11, the postposition -da is omitted after rt n i n - s i k i 1 -1 a (cf. line 8). As for the name Ninsikilla,"2 it is to be noted that since our passage (cf. lines 8 and 11) states specifically that the goddess bearing this name is the wife of Enki, it is to be taken as another epithet of the goddess usuallv known as Damgalnunna, and is hardly to be identified with the name Ninsikilla of ? L II 550. 498.33 Lines 13-30. For the general meaning of the passage, cf. the introduction and note 10. The verbal forms in the passage are rendered as presents since all those which are not ambiguous show the present-future ending; cf. lines 10, 20, 21, 20.34 In line 14, since the complex g? - d a r mus en - r i seems to be a genitive con struction, the last syllable might have been expected to read - r a.34a In the same * The commentary assumes on the part of the reader a grammatical approach based on GSG as clarified and modified in the past two decades, and a reasonably critical use of the lexical material gathered in the various Sumerian lexicons; in gram matical and lexical matters, it therefore restricts its comments to details which deviate, or seem to deviate, from the expected norm. Moreover, it refrains from taking note of the numerous miscopies, and misreadings of the earlier scholars; it would serve no constructive purpose to do so since it is assumed that the reader will follow the transliteration from the photographs. Note finally that in the commentary, A refers to the University Museum tablet (cf. note 1), and B, to the Louvre tablet ( cf. note 0 ). 31 Cf. already Jastrow, AJSL 33. 102, note 1. 32 For the sake of consistency such names as d n i n - s i k i 1 -1 a, (1 n i n - k u r - r a, d d a m - g a 1 - n u n - n a, etc. will be rendered as Ninsikilla, Ninkurra, Damgal nunna, etc. rather than as Ninsikil, Ninkur (cf. e.g. SM 55 if. ), Damgalnun, etc. Only in case of Ninhursag (and, e.g., Ereskigal) will the shorter renderings be used, since these have become more or less standard. 33 No matter what may be true of the later syncretisms, it is to be carefully noted that in our Sumerian literary texts of the early post-Sumerian period, the individual deities and their familial interrelationships are not confused with each other. It is for this reason that it seems most unlikely that a goddess such as Ninsikilla, the wife of d nk1- gun (cf. now Kraus, Symbolae . . . Paulo Kosehaker Dedieatae 52, note 4) should be identified Avith Damgalnunna, the wife of Enki. Similarly in line 74, the goddess Damgalnunna is not to be identified with Nintu (i.e. Ninhursag) mentioned in lines 05-00. Nor is it likely that the goddess Ninti of lines 200, 270, is to be identified with Damgalnunna, the wife of Enki, in spite of the fact that d n i n -1 i is one of the numerous names used for the latter. 34 Difficult is the verbal form n u - u m - n i g i n of line 28, which on the surface seems to be a preterit. As for the nu-ub-zu of lines 17, 18, and perhaps 1?), it is a permansive of the verb z u " to learn " and is thus best rendered as a present of the verb "to know"; perhaps something similar is involved in n u - u m - n i ff i n. 34aFor this bird cf. now Weidner, AOF 13.230 f., and note particularly that, according to SBI1 02. 23, its cry is a mark of death and desolation. 22</page><page sequence="23">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research line, note the fuller writing ini-jiiu-ni-ib-lii for the n u - m u - n i - b i of lines 13, 22, 27, 21). In line 17, the second sign has only two horizontal Avedges inside instead of the expected three, that is, it resembles T ? G rather than s ? .8? In line 18, the final -e of the first complex seems unjustified since it seems to be the subject of a passive verbal form. For nu-mu-un-su "widow" in line 19 cf. 8L II 75. 17, and under aim an ? tu in ?L III 2, p. 14; cf. also lines 37-38 of the Utu hymn TRS 79 = PBS I 2 No. 118 (see also BASOR 90.19, note 9) where n u - s ? G " orphan " is followed by n u - m u - u n - s u ( ! ) " widow." For the trans lation " sick-eyed " for i g i - g i g (literally "sick-eye") in line 22, and "sick headed" for sag-gig (literally "sick-head") in line 23, cf. the Avell-loKrwn rendering " black-headed " for s a g - g i g (literally " black-head " ). In line 20, note that k i - s i k i 1 is not followed by a subject element and that therefore the verbs should probably be treated as passives.30 In the same line, note the erasure of an i;ru-sign between -zal and uru-. In line 27, if the translation of the first complex is correct, the ATerb bala "to cross " is preceded, quite as expected, by a locative; cf. Poebel, AJSL 50. 150. If the assumption that that the passage describes Dilmun as a land that knoAVs neither sickness nor death is correct, the river referred to in this line should be the river of the nether Avorld; cf. for the present SM 40. In line 28, the " his " is assumed to refer to the 1 ? - i d - d a - b a 1 a - e of the pre ceding line. Lines 31-40. In line 31, a-a "father" is honorific, it does not prove actual paternity; cf. also note 33. In lines 32 (cf. lines 33, 34, 30) the final complex n a m - m u - s ? - m a - z u is difficult to translate in spite of its seemingly Avell-knoAvn components, especially since its relationship to the preceding complexes is uncertain. In line 35, the translation assumes that n u - m u - u n -1 u k u - a is not a relative form in spite of the final -a ; cf. RA 34.121. Line 37 might perhaps have been expected to correspond to line 35, but the traces of the only extant sign do not seem to point in that direction. Lines 41-04. For this passage, cf. Albright, JAOS 39. 07-74, and Falkenstein, ZA 45. 188-189.3T In lines 42 and 53, if the translation is correct, note the rather unusual plene writing of subject particle - e as - ( b ) i - e . In lines 43 and 54, the first sign is neither g Ik nor ug but rather LAK 251. In lines 45 and 50, the position of k i -1 a between the direct object and the ATerbal form is rather unusual. Nor is it clear how, if at all, this k i -1 a is related to the -1 a complexes of the two preceding lines.3S In lines 47-48 and 58-59, the translation assumes the subject to be d u t u just as in the lines immediately preceding. For the verbal form h u - m u - r a - n a8 - n a8 as a present, cf. AS 10.18, 43. If the -ra- of this verbal form is intended to be a dat?ATc, rather than a dimensional infix,39 the rendering "for thee" would be rather difficult and perhaps unnecessary in the English trans lation of the line. For the restoration of line 49a, cf. line 01. In line 50, note the form h?-a which seems to correspond to h ? - i m of line 49 ; it is difficult to see how, if at all, the rendering of the two forms should differ. For the reading ? - b ? - ? s in lines 52 and 04, cf. AS 12. 93. As for the complex u 4 - N E -a , both its reading and meaning remain obscure.40 In line 00, note the odat?ous scribal omission of p ? ; the translation includes it as certain. 35 This is true of all the S ?-signs in our text, cf. lines 52, 04, 65, 172. 301 had not realized this AA'hen preparing the translation for BASOR 90. 37 Note, therefore, the importance of my restoration of lines 41-40 which proATides the subject of lines 42-48 and 53-59, and helps to clarify the meaning of the entire passage. 38 Note that in line 45, the restoration of the end of the A^erb as -1 ? m - m u is probable but not quite certain. 30 Cf. Falkenstein, loe. cit., 189, where the grammatical ambiguity is correctly analyzed; note, in addition, that if our scribe intended to use the dimensional infix, it is not clear why he failed to Avrite the Arerbal form as h ? - i m -1 a - n a8 - n a? in correspondence with i m -1 a - n a8 - n a8 of lines 58-59. 40 Cf. u4-ne, a parallel of u? -1 e - n a "a restful day" in SEM 58 i 19; on the other hand ut - N e seems to refer to an evil storm in AS 12.38, line 202, and in the ?ulgi hymn TRS 44 (cf. JAOS 54.415) line 62. Falkenstein's transcription of the complex as b a b b a r - d ? - a, and his translation, without comment, of this formless and meaningless complex as " als . . . aufging " is altogether unjustified, and indeed for a scholar whose work is usually so careful and trustworthy, quite unexpected. Cf. also note 06. 23</page><page sequence="24">Supplementary Studies No. 1 Lines 05-72. For the interpretation of this difficult passage, doubtful as it is, cf. the Introduction and especially note 24. In lines 05-00, the gloss T A r after the first complex is unintelligible. In the complex gestug-gi-tuku-a, note the seemingly superfluous -a (cf. comment to line 35) and the strange fact that the object of the ATerb t u k u seems to be treated as a locative. Note, too, that the translation of lines 05-66 assumes that gestug-gi-tuku-a modifies the fol loAving d n i n -1 u, rather that the preceding d e n - k i (or a s - n i ), since in line 60, the subject element folloAvs immediately upon den-ki-. In line 07, e is treated as the direct object of a compound verb a ? dun.41 Similarly in line 08, g i is treated as a direct object of a ATerbal complex which seems to consist of a locative complex and Arerb. For the T?G-sign in line 69, cf. comment to line 17, and note 35. Lines 73-88. Lines 73-74, in spite of the corrected reading, still remain largely obscure, especially since the meaning of n?-a and the reading and meaning of K A - N i are so uncertain.42 Line 74 seems to parallel line 73, but at present it is not clear Iioav tt&gt; relate intelligibly the respective complexes to each other. Very difficult, too, is the implication of the expression a - d d a m - g a 1 - n u n - n a " the semen of Damgalnunna 43 which, to judge from the K A - N I that folloAvs it, may be parallel in some way to the n ? - a - a m b a r - r a of the preceding line which is also followed by ka-ni. In line 74, the last sign is slightly damaged ; it seems to be K a but the possibility that it is k a + ? is not to be excluded altogether. In line 75, the translation assumes that dnin-hur-sag-g?-ke444 is not the subject (that, to judge from the several parallel passages, is of course Enki), but rather an anticipatory genitive (-ke4 for -ka); instead of s?-ga one might therefore have expected s ? - g a - n a.45 For the correct interpretation of a and s ? in line 75 and the corresponding lines, cf. already KS 1, p. 58, 59, 80; MRS 190 and especially note 15; and now Jacobsen, JNES 2. 119ff. In line 70 (also lines 85, 102, 122), the final -ka is probably for -kam ; cf. line 09' of B. For the correct interpretation of lines 77-85, cf. already Ungnad, ZDMO 254, especially note 5, and Witzel, loc. cit. 58, 59, 82. In line 8(5 (cf. also lines 100, 125, and probably 247, 249) the reading of the second (and fifth) sign is quite uncertain; it is neither lu m, nor L I, nor t i r. In line 87, - a m a - k a 1 a m - k a might have been expected to read a m a - k a 1 a m - m a - k e 4. In lines 80 and 87 and the corresponding lines, the translation " good princely fat " is a literal rendering of i?-d?g-nun-na which may, however, have a more specific and idiomatic meaning.40 In line 88, the 41 It seems hardly likely that the generally accepted word division aat1i?c1i reads the fourth and fifth signs as e - a is correct, especially if e - should prove to mean "ditch (es)," since in that case the complex would be expected to read e - g a, the root of the Sumerian Avord for " ditch ( es ) " being e ( g ). 42 If read - k a - n i, as it is tentatively in our transliteration, it seems to com plete a genitive complex (i. e. n ? - a - a m b a r - a k - a n i) ; there is at least a slight possibility, hoAveArer, that ka-ni is to be read ka-zal and that this latter is the object of the verb mi-ni-in-dug4 (?) of line 74. In any case the sense remains obscure. 43 Note carefully that a - is not to be translated " father " ; in the literary texts of our period, the form is always a - a. Note, too, that Damgalnunna is not to be confused with the goddess Nintu; cf. note 33. 44 The goddess is called Ninhursag in lines 75, 187, 218, 222, 224, 240, 251, and Nintu in lines 05, 00, 87, 128; the reason for the variation, if there AAras any, other than a purely mechanical one, is not apparent. 45 In lines 101-102 Avhich describe Enki's impregnation of Ninmu, the name of the goddess is omitted in line 101. Similarly in lines 121-122 which describe Enki's impregnation of Ninkurra, the name of the goddess is omitted in line 122. On the other hand, in lines 15-10 of B which describe the impregnation of the goddess Ninsig, the name of the goddess is given in line 15 but it seems to be treated as a direct object governed by a verbal compound a ? ri. Similarly in lines 184-185 which describe Enki's impregnation of Uttu, B (A is not presetted at this point) follows the same pattern as in the lines involving the goddess Ninsig. 40 There is some possibility that the -nun- of our complex may be related in some Avay to the nun Avhich is one of the more common epithets of Enki. In SM 50, the rendering " good butter," treated the complex as if it read i?-nun dug. In any case the figure of speech is designed to portray the ease with which the birth was achieved. 24</page><page sequence="25">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research restoration of dn i n - ni ? ,4T crucial to the understanding of the poem (and missed by all preceding translators) is quite certain from an analysis of the structure and meaning of the parallel passages in lines 72-88, 89-108, 109-127. Lines 89-108. In line 89, the more correct form of the second complex Avould read g ? - i d - d a - s ? ; 48 the final - ? of m i - n i - i b - ? , to judge from the original, is probable but not quite certain. In line 90 40 (cf. also lines 110, 131, 132, etc.), the translation " looks about " for Sumerian i m - d a -1 ? - e - d ? , Avas suggested to me by A. Wright; it suits the context admirably.49"1 In line 91, d i s i m u d 50 should be folloAved by - r a, not by -de; cf. the correct form in B 0. Line 92, to judge from the context, contains AAThat may be described as a rhetorical question on "the part of Enki; for the compound ne ?sub, cf. AS 10. 20-28.51 In line 95, note the translation of the verb as an imperative in spite of its form in the text. This is based not only on the context, but also on the text of line 115 AAThere the A'erb su-ub-bu-ma-ni is the correct and expected imperative ; there is little doubt that the nu-mu-un-su-ub-bi of line 95 is another of the numerous scribal slips in our text. In line 97 the complex t u M - d i r i g " mighty Avind " may of course be transliterated i ai - d i r i g " cloud," but the former seems more suitable to the context. Note that to judge from lines 97-99, Enki Avas separated by a con siderable distance from the bank on Avhich Ninmu appeared, and had to travel by boat to reach her. In line 99, the meaning of the second complex is unknoAvn,52 nor 47 The reading of the sign sar in the name d n i n - s A r, as mil (until the very final preparation of this study I had been attributing to it the traditional reading sar Avithout noting the possibility that it also has the value mu), is to be concluded from CT 24. 10, line 17 where the ditto sign probably refers only to the NiN of the preceding line; the line therefore reads ?nin-mu, which seems to be nothing more than an orthographic variant for the preceding line Avhich reads d n i n s A it (Similarly, in line 18, the name is probably to be read dnin (j. e. ditto) -gir and Pantheon 2095, 2090, are probably to be modified accordingly.) Moreover, since it is m i? (not sar) which is to be equated with the Accadian as?? and band, the meaning of the name becomes clear ; she is the " Lady who brings forth (plants, herbs, etc.)." This goddess Ninmu is therefore one of the deities whose activities concerned vegetation. Thus she is mentioned with d n i n - s i g7, the "Lady who makes green (the ea?th?)," another vegetation deity, in e.g. 2R 59 obv. 28 ff., and AOF 2. 74 f., and Avith Asnan, Lahar, etc. in Weissbach, Missellen, pi. 12. 33. 48 In line 3 of B the complex seems to read g ? - i d (!) -da (!) - k a m - s ? (?) ; however, since - k a m should not be followed by a postposition, and since the folloAving -se (?) is separated from -kam by a considerable blank space, perhaps the se (?) belongs to the verbal complex. 49 In line 4 of B the second complex reads a m b a r (!) -1 a for a m b a r - r a ; the verbal form folloAving seems to involve some miscopv. 40aCf. perhaps &amp;L II 481.8, 18; SOI 108. It must be stressed, however, that all the examples there cited are either from syllabaries or from late bilinguals, and that perhaps more originally it is only the compound ig i ? l? aa?i?cIi could be equated with amaru, qahi, etc; our rendering for i m - d a-1 ? - e - d ? is therefore by no means certain. Albright also makes the interesting suggestion that to judge from lines 89-127, Enki Avas actually lying in wait among the reed-thickets on the bank of the river in order to seize and rape the young goddesses who appeared on the opposite bank, and that this would give point to Nintu's warning to the inexperienced Uttu (lines 128 ff.). ro The transliteration of the name of this Janus-faced deity (cf. Ungnad, AOF 5. 185) as isimu (d) is based on the fact that when it is the subject of a transi tive verbal form it is regularly folloAved by the syllable - d ? resulting from a com bination of a final - d with the subject element - e. However, its Accadian equiva lent usmii, which at least on the surface certainly looks like a loan-word from the Sumerian, clearly points to a name i s i m u without a final consonant. 51 It is noAv quite clear that ne is the direct object of s u b, that is, that literally the compound means "to press the . . . (upon someone)"; hence probably the locative - e of 1 ? -1 u r - s a g5 - g a - e, although it seems rather strange that this -e AATas not absorbed by the immediately preceding a of - s a g5 - g a (cf. comment to lines 42 and 53 ). 52 B 12 seems to read i (?) -na (?) - g i m (?) -pad for our bar-girim-m a. 25</page><page sequence="26">Supplementary Studies No. 1 is the sense of m in-ka m - m a quite clear in the context. Note, too, that in line 99 the verb begins with n a m-mi- instead of hi- as in line 98, although at least on the surface the two verbs seem to be identical in meaning and structure.53 In line 100, the rendering "embrace" for the compound gaba ? tab, literally per haps " to clasp the breast," is reasonably certain.54 BetAveen lines 104 and 105 Ave are to understand of course 0 lines for the days 3 to 8 ; the scribe omitted them purposefully to saAre time, space, and effort. In line 108, the restoration of dnin-kur-ra, like that of dnin-m? in line 88 (cf. comment to that line) is quite assured; Langdon's copy of the third sign as tu is evidently a pure guess, as can be seen from the photograph. Lines 109-127. Cf. comment to lines 89-108; the tAvo passages are alike except for the following: In lines 109, 113, 110, 120,54a the name of the goddess is Ninkurra instead of Ninmu; in line 121, -ga is omitted after sa-; following line 123 aat1i?c1i corresponds to line 103, there is no line corresponding to line 104; in line 127 the goddess born is Uttu instead of Ninkurra. For the goddess LTttu, cf. note 28, and note that since according to our poem Uttu is begotten of Enki, the description m?rat anim (cf. AOF 2.74 and note 7) refers probably only to dnin-uttu, and not to Uttu. For the translation " fair " of the complex ni-dim4, note that it seems to correspond to s a g5 - g a in B 70'.55 53 In the corresponding B 12-13, it is possible that bi-gub is the verb used in both lines. 64 In B 14, 04', the corresponding verb is what may be termed the double com pound gaba ? su ? dib; to judge from the locative prefix im-mi- used Avith it, gaba is there treated as a locative rather than as an accusative. 54a In line 120, the first complex might have been expected to read &lt;*nin-kur ra-ke4, since it is the subject of a transitiAre verbal form. B5 Corresponding to our passages in lines 89-108 and 109-127 is the obATerse of B from line 3 to the end, except that the deity involved is Ninsig (cf. note 47) instead of Ninmu and Ninkurra; that is, it Avould seem that according to the Arersion of the myth in the Louvre tablet, Enki's impregnation of Ninkurra did not result in the birth of Uttu but in the birth of Ninsig (not mentioned in A) and that it Avas the goddess Ninsig Avho, folloAving impregnation by Enki, gaA^e birth to Uttu. In addition to this major difference, B shoAvs a number of interesting Avariants from A, as folloAvs: Line 3 corresponds, except of course for the name of the deity, to our lines 89 and 109; cf. comment to the former. Line 4 reads: den-ki (!) -ke4 a m b a r ( ! ) -1 a i m - . . . i m - d a -1 ? - [e - d ?] (cf. lines 90 and 110); following a m b a r -1 a the expected complex is i m - d a -1 ? - e - d ?, but De Genouillac's copy does not point to this reading. Line 5 reads perhaps d n i n - s i g-7 (!) g? (!) -id da-ka m igi [i m ( ?) ] - Mia ( ?) - n i - in - [b a r ( ?) ], "He (i.e. Enki) s[aw] Ninsig on the bank of the riATer " ; this line has no corresponding text in our passages. For line 0, cf. comment to line 91, and note that it uses the longer ideogram for isimud; cf. e. g. OECT I line 18. Line 7 reads 1 ? -1 u r - S a g5 - g a - g i m m?-e ne nam-in- [su-ub-bi] (it thus varies but slightly from our lines 92 and 112); the use of -gim for -e in the first complex and the omission of - m i - betAveen n a m - and -in- in the verbal form, seem strange. Line 8 reads d n i n - s i g7 ( ! ) - s a g5 - g a - g i m m?-e g ? s n a m - i n - d ? ; its major variant is the use of gis ? d? "to cohabit with " for ne ? sub "to kiss " in our lines 93 and 113. Line 9 corresponds to our lines 94 and 114; note the variant disiraud (with the longer ideogram) -e for disimud-d?. Line 10 corresponds to our lines 97 and 117 (B has no text corresponding to our lines 95-90 and 115-110) ; cf. comment to the former, and note the inexplicable i (?) -zu (?) before the second [tu15-d]irig ga-ri. Lines 11 and 12 correspond to lines 98-99 and 118-119 (cf. the comment to the former ) ; note in addition the use of - ? m for - a (cf. already comment to line 70) and the probable omission of the determinat?ATe gis before m ? ( ! ). Line 13 reads gaba (!) su im-mi-in-d?b ?r (!) -ra (!) na ?b-n[?]-a, " He embraced her, he lay in her lap"; it corresponds to our line 100 and 120 (cf. comment to the former). Line 14 reads: l?-tur gis i m - m i - i n - d Un ne i m - m a - n i - i n - s u - ' [u b], "He cohabited Avith the young one, he kissed her" (note the ATariant dun for d? in lines 8 and 07' of the Arery same tablet); this line has no corresponding text in A. Line 15 reads den-ki ke4 (!) d n i n ( i ) . s i g, ( t ) a g ? [m] u - n i - i n - r i ; it corresponds to lines 101 20</page><page sequence="27">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research Lines 128-185. For lines 129-130, whose meaning is clear at last, cf. JAOS 04. 21, note 105; PAPS 85.313 (comment to lines 29-31); and especially BASOR 79.25, note 25.5U For lines 131-2, cf. lines 90 and 110. To judge from the context, Ninhursag's instructions to Uttu probably warn the latter against cohabiting Avith Enki unless and until he brings her a gift of fruits and ATegetables. For Avhile lines 133-147 are almost entirely destroyed, and it is therefore not certain who addresses Avhom with the speech ending in line 152?possibly it is Ninhursag addressing Uttu or the gardener?the remainder of our passage is fairly clear. Thus lines 153-107 describe the manner in Avhich Enki obtained the cucumbers, apples (?), and grapes,*7 and according to lines 108-185, it is only after Enki has presented them to Uttu that the impregnation of the latter takes place. For the restoration of lines 148-150, cf. lines 105-107 and 175-177, and perhaps 102-104 (cf. comment to these lines). The rendering of g i s h a s h u r and g i ? g e s t i n in these passages as " apples ( ? ) " and " grapes " rather than as " apple-tree " or " vine," is based on the parallelism with uk?s "cucumbers"; note, too, that B 58'-00' (=our lines 175-177) omits the determinat?ATe gis before h ash u r and g e s t i n.

The - n a in sur-ra-na, i* rendered as though it Avere an error for - b a, since the complex seems to be exactly parallel to the g u - u L - it l - b a and ga-ra-an-ba of the two succeeding lines; it must be stressed, hoAveATer, that this is merely conjecture, especially in vieAv of the -a-ni in B 58' and 59' (cf. note 01). The same is true of the rendering "bring" for D u - u m, Avhere DU is given the value turn, and Avhore t?m-um is taken to be the imperative form corresponding to an indicat?ATe i m - m (a) - t? in. "To take hold of the leash" may connote " to folloAV the lead of someone," " to do exactly as had been planned by someone" (cf. already Witzel, loe. cit. 80-87); in our case it seems to refer to Ninhursag's scheme by which Uttu obtained from Enki the cucumbers, apples (?), and grapes before cohabiting Avith him. In line 153, the force of m i n - k a m - m a is not clear, cf. comment to line 99. In lines 154-150, note that e, p a0, and k i s 1 a h are treated as direct objects of the A^erbal compound a ? si, although to judge from the meaning and original relationship of the two components a and si, as Avell as from the use of the locative thematic particle b i -, they might have and 121, except that it actually names the deity impregnated (cf. note 45), omits -ga after sa-, and has mu- for ba- as the verbal prefix. Line 10 corresponds exactly to lines 102 and 122, except that it probably has -kam (!) for -ka (cf. comment to line 70). The passage contained in lines 17-24 corresponds to that in our lines 77-85, 103-105, and 123-124, except that it repeats the lines for eight of the nine days of pregnancy instead of for all the nine days, as in our first passage, or for only three and two days, as in our second and third passages. In detail the passage may be analyzed as follows: Line 17 reads: munus-a ut - 1 - b i i t u - 1 - b i n a - n a m " Of ' womanhood,' its one day, behold it is its one month " (the translation treats m u n u s - a as if it A\rere n a m - m u n u s - a ) ; line 18 reads \i4 - 2 - b i i t u - 2 - b i n a - n a m, " its tAvo days, behold they are two months (similarly lines 19-23); line 24 reads perhaps as folloAvs: [u4 - 9 - b i itu-9-bi] i t u - n a m - m u n u s - a ( ! ? ) n [a (?) - n a m ( ?) ], to judge from the copy, hoAvever, there seems to be no room for the i t u - 9 - b i. Lines 25-20 correspond to our lines 85-80, 100-107, 125-120, except of course for the name of the impregnated god dess Avhich in B is Ninsig. Line 27 of B, noAV completely destroyed, is to be restored to read [d uttu- m uniis-s a g5 -ga i n -1 u - u d], that is, it corresponds to our line 127, except that it reads m u n u s - s a gy, - g a (cf. B 70' ) for m u n u s - N I - n i m4. As for the first two lines of B (cf. the beginning of this note) Avhich seem to read : d n \ n . k u r - r a d n i n - s i g7 i g i im.... 1 ? -1 u r - n i ... im-? si . . ., these have no corresponding lines in A. 50 To judge from our h?-dib (cf. also lines 151-2) and the parallel ATerbal forms in the passages cited in the listed references, h ? - may be combined with the preterit (cf. the doubt expressed in OSO ? 042). r'7 Perhaps the process is as follows: Enki fills the ditches, canals, and unculti vated places with water, and thus fructifies the gardener's garden. The latter, therefore, embraces him joyfully and is evidently ready to sIioav his gratitude. Whereupon Enki, if the restoration of lines 102-104 is correct, bids him bring him the cucumbers, apples (?) and grapes, and the gardener complies. 27</page><page sequence="28">been expected to be treated as locatives; cf. comment to line 07. In line 157, the word d?Arision involving the complex h?l-a-na is quite uncertain. For g? - da ? l? " embrace," cf. g ? - d a m u - n i -1 ? ( BE XXXI 35. 20 ) and its Assyrian rendering innidruma (EG 09.85). The restoration of lines 102-105 is of course pure conjecture, based on A\iiat seems to be the demands of the context.58 For lines 105-107, cf. comment to lines 148-150. In line 108, if the translation "his face turned green " is correct, the gardener's action must have displeased and troubled Enki in some way, but from the extant material it is difficult to see why the acts described in lines 105-107 should have angered Enki. In line 170, if, as the trans lation assumes, the first complex contain? the possessive pronoun, it might in stricter logic have been expected to read ?-za rather than ? - n a. In the same line, the meaning of the compound al ? d? is unknown; for gal-?, cf. PAPS 85.298, line 70. In line 172, the reading h ? - ? m- in the last complex but one is not altogether certain but highly probable; for a leading deity such as Enki, to giAre something as a " so be it " may be another Avay of saying " to present as a permanent gift" (cf. .4aS' 12.32, line 101). In 1. 173, note that the Sumerian idiom is "to open a door at the house."58 In line 174, the postposition -ra should have folloA\red m u n u s - n i - di m4 rather than duttu.00 For lines 175-177, cf. lines 148-150.ri In line 178, the meaning of the compounds kab ? s i (g) and su ? s ig is unknoAvn.0- Lines 179-185 are found in B only (B 03'-09') ; A is broken at this point, but to judge from the size of the break (six or seven lines for our lines 179-187), it probably omitted several of the lines in the passage describing the sex-play between Enki and Uttu (lines 180-183). In line 179, note the idiomatic use of the postposition - r a Avith the object of the compound u 1 ? t i ( ? ). For the first part of line 180, cf. comment to line 100 and note 54; in the second half the prefix ib- seems to be missing, cf. comment to the line B 13 in note 55. The reading has " buttock (s) " for the sign z?g in lines 181, 180, and 187, Avhich seems to suit the context admirably, Avas suggested by Albright Avho also referred me to his relevant comment on sapru in RA 10. 192.fi2a For line 182, cf. comment to line 180. In line 183, note the omission of -mi- betAveen im- and -in-, and 58 Note, too, that these three lines should perhaps follow immediately upon line 100, while line 104 may have contained a statement introductory to the gardener's compliance with Enki's request. 60 If, as is not improbable, B 57' corresponds to this line, it is to be restored to read [d u 11 u] - m u n u s - s a g5 - g a ? - a [i g b a - a n - k ? d]. 60 This line is omitted in B. C1 In B the corresponding passage consists of four lines (B 58'-01') : uk?s (!) sur (?) - r a - a - n i i m - m a - a b - [s i - m u] h a s b u r (!) g u - u 1 ( ! ? ) -1 a - a - n i i m - m a - a b - [s ? - m u] g e s t i n g a - r a - a n - a - n i ( ! ? ) i m - m a - a b - [s ? - m u] k a s g i - b a - a n - g u -1 a im- m a - a b - [s ? - m u]. For the omission of the determinative g i s before h a s b u r and g e s t i n, cf. comment to lines 148-150. The significance of the Avariant - a - n i, certain in the first tAvo lines, is not clear; cf. comment to lines 148-150. Instead of k a s " date Avine " in the last line Avhich has no counterpart in A, one might have expected s ult -1 u m " dates " in parallel Avith g e ? t i n " grapes." In gi-ba-an-gu-la, - g u -1 a may perhaps stand for the adjective " large " ; note, too, the omission of the expected - a - n i at the end of the complex. 02 The corresponding line B 02' omits the first two complexes, and inserts - u n - and omits -na-ab- in the ATerbal forms. For kab (line 178) as a part of the body, cf. probably CT 15. 14, line 15. 01ia Particularly instructive is the reference to K 8488, Avhere the last half of the Sumerian line should be transliterated as follows : has t i b ? r - r a b ? - i n - r a, " he (Marduk) slapped his buttocks" ; that is t i b ir ? ra (literally "to hurl the palm of the hand) is a compound verb to be equated with the Accadian mah?su. Note that in spite of the writing tibir-ra, as if it Av?re a locative, in this late text, tibir Avas probably more originally the direct object of ra, and has might therefore have been expected to be a locative and to have read h ?s - a ; cf. e.g. te-na tibir (variant tibir-r a) b?-in-ra, "he (Gilgames) slapped his (UuwaAva's) cheek1' (line 144 of the poem "Gilgames and the Land of the Living," Avhose scientific edition "will probably appear as another of the series of Supplement?r}/ Studies of the BASOR). 28</page><page sequence="29">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research cf. comment to B7 and 8 in note i)"). For lines 184-185, cf. comment to B 15 and 10 in note ?iry. Lines 180-217. Lines 180-187, Avhich like lines 170-185 are found in B only,"3 contain too many unknoAvns for a constructive approximation of their meaning; they seem to take the place of the impregnation passages that followed Enki's intercourse with the goddesses Ninhursag, Ninmu, and Ninkurra, and their contents may be related in some way to the sprouting of the eight plants in the lines that follow.0* For the restoration of lines 188-105, cf. lines 201, 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, and 215. In lines 190 and 205, both the restoration and the meaning are quite doubtful; cf. perhaps SL II 318.84. In lines 193 and 211, if the restoration ?\va-Ava is correct, it may perhaps be equated with the Accadian arantum; for this plant, cf. especially AS 4. 10 ff. For the cassia-plant in lines 195 and 215, cf. especially JastroAv, loc. cit. 134, note 4. For line 190, cf. lines 90, 110, 131. In line 197 d i s i ni u d should have been followed by - r a, rather than -de, cf. comment to line 91. To judge from the sense of our passage, line 198 might have been expected to contain Enki's statement of his decision to perform the acts de scribed as performed in line 217; it might therefore have been expected to read: ? m ? - e nam-bi g a - b i - i n -1 a r s ? - b a g a - b a - n i - i n - z u ( ? ), "Of the plants I would decree their fate, know their ' heart '." However the portion of the line following n a m - b i is noAv completely destroyed on the tablet itself and the photograph (Langdon's copy at this point is suspect) is very difficult to make out; its traces, however, point against the suggested restoration.,,n Lines 218-end.00 in line 218 the second complex, Avhich consists of a double genitive, might have been expected to read m u - d e n k i - g a. Line 219, as the writ ing i-bi (for igi) indicates, uses the Emesal dialect since it contains the direct speech of Ninhursag.07 In the same line the verbal form folloAving en-ii a might have been expected to read b a - u g5 - g a - a ? instead of b a - u g5 - g i - a, cf. Poebel, AFO 9. 203, note 5. In line 220, s a h a r -1 a might have been expected to read sahar-ra (i.e. sahar-a); cf. line 102 and (especiallv) lines 294, 315, 325, of "Inanna's Descent "~ (PAPS 85. 295 ff.), and OECT I pi/4, line 7; for another example of this phenomenon cf. note 49. In the same line, note the reading - n e - for the sign ne (one before the last in the line) ; it is assured by the Avell-knoAvn fact that the root of the ATerb for " to sit " is d u r u n Avhen used Avith a plural subject. In line 221, the force of the infix -da-68 is not clear. For the reading and meaning of line 222, cf. already GSG ?235. The verb in line 224 might have been expected to read mu-?i-t? m - m u -un- n am (i.e. mu-'-si-t ? m - en-?m); the -e- is unjustified. Lines 220-228 describe the fox's preparatory acts prior to his bringing Ninhursag before Enlil; only the meaning of line 228, howeArer, is reasonably assured."0? 00a Lines 229-245 are too poorly presetted for 03 They correspond to the last two lines in B, Avhile A (rev. ii) begins again with line 187; note, too, that the assumption that there is nothing missing between line 187 (i.e. the last line of B) and line 188 (i.e. the first restorable line of A rev. ii) is not certain but fairly probable. 04 It is by no means certain, hoAvever, Avhether line 180-187 should be taken with preceding passage, or as our translation assumes, Avith that which folloAvs. Note that in line 185, if the word division is correct, the -mu of the second complex would seem to indicate that the line contains the Avords of either Enki or Ninhursag. 05 Note, too, that the scribe wrote the first part of the line rather Avidely spaced and that he then seemed to realize that the larger part of the text of the line Avas still to be Avritten and therefore squeezed his signs rather tightly. 60 For the latest misinterpretation of lines 218-224, cf. ZA 45. 189-190. 07 In the passage contained in lines 251-209, hoAvever, the numerous lines con taining Ninhursag's Avords sIioav no sign of the Emesal Avriting; cf. the repeated a-na-zu ( not t a - z u ), and the fact that the en or n i n which begins the names of several of the deities is not written as urn un or g a san (cf. note 74). c8 So, not - r a - ; this supposed example of the use of the infix -ra- is therefore to be stricken from ZA 45. 180 ff. 00 Cf. s i m .... i g i - n a ( instead of our i g i - n i ) b a - n i - i n - g a r in lines 25 and 110 of "Inanna's Descent" (PAPS 85. 295 ff.) where the translation is to be modified accordingly. COa Note that if the possessiAre pronouns in these three lines refer to the fox, one might expect -bi instead of -ni; cf., e.g., AOF 11. 303, n. 29. 29</page><page sequence="30">Supplementary Studies No. 1 detailed constructive comment; certain it is that the passage describes Ninhursag's return to the gods as a result of the fox's cunning acts. Lines 240-249 contain four acts of the x4nunnaki Avhose meaning and purpose are not clear.70 In line 250, the translation "by" is ATery doubtful; actually the complex seems to say a in her vulva." If the ses-mu of lines 251, 254, 257, etc. is to be taken literally, Ninhursag and Enki are conceived by our poem as brother and sister. For the use of the Erne-k u instead of the expected Emesal dialect in lines 251-209, cf. note 07. In line 252, the first complex should stand for the name of a part of the body; note that it begins with the sign ? B Avhich is, therefore, the superficial link betA\Teen the body organ and Abu,71 the deity Avhose birth is in some Avay responsible for its healing (cf. already JastroAV, loe. cit. 140, and note 22 of this study). For the problem hwohTed in the translation of im-ma-ra-an-tu-ud (lines 253, 250, 258, etc.) cf. note 22. In line 255, the rendering " jaAV " for utul assumes that utul and tul are the same word, just as are e. g. utud and t u d " to give birth." The deity dnin-t?l-la in line 250 is a male deity (cf. line 271); he is therefore not to be confused with dnin-t?l-l?, the Avife of Ninurta (cf. Pantheon 2715 and TRS 10.07). In line 258, the goddess Ninsutu who according to line 272, marries Ninazu, may be identical with d n i n - G ? R -f- k ? r - d a ; cf. Pantheon 2471 (the reading of the third sign as g?r there and in 8L 550. 130 is of course an error) and TRS 10.401. For the goddess Ninkasi (line 200), cf. Albright, AJSL 30.207 ff.; Kramer, JAOS 54.412; 8L II 550.318; SLT 122 obv. iii 18-19; TRS 10. 332 ff.; cf. also note 22. For the goddess Nazi (line 202) and her husband dnin-DAR-a (cf. line 274), cf. especially TRS 10.293-295. The last legible sign in line 203 and the second sign in line 204 (also the second sign in line 275) is a, not da. For the goddess Azimua (written da (not ?) -zi nni-a) and her husband Ningiszida (cf. line 275), cf. TRS 10.303-304 and SLT 122 iii 4-0. In line 200 (cf. also line 270J, the goddess Ninti is probably not to be identified Avith Damgalnunna, one of whose names or epithets is also Ninti; cf. note 33.73 In line 208, the god den-sae-ag, who according to line 277, is the "lord of Dilmun," is identical of course with the Dilmun deity Enzag; cf. BASOR 90. 18, note 0. Line 209, according to our translation, contains the words of Ninhursag. It is not altogether impossible that it is Enki avIio is speaking; if so the line should be rendered " For the little ones which thou hast caused to be born. . . ." Again, our translation assumes that lines 270-277 contain the Avords of Enki; there is a bare possibility that it is Ninhursag avIio is speaking.74 For the deities in lines 270 277, cf. comment to lines 253-208; in line 270, note that n i n - i t u - e might have been expected to read nin-itu-da. For the restoration of line 278, cf. e.g. the last half of TRS 54.43 which reads a-a-den-ki za gal ( ! ) (in the duplicate OECT pi. 4. 30 a-a is omitted) ; it is a typical scribal phrase closing compositions dealing with Enki.75 [On pp. 17 and 28 of this study has is rendered as " buttock(s) "; it may also be rendered "thigh(s) " Avith Geers (JNES 4. 175, n. 185).] 70 The first sign in line 247 and the second sign in line 249 are probably identical Avith the second sign in line 80; cf. comment to that line. 71 Cf. note 22. For the pronunciation of the name of the god, cf. Thureau-Dangin, RA 32. 150, and note the writing dab-ba-u in e. g. line 25 of the "Lamentation over the Destruction of Ur " (AS 12.18). 72 To judge from the order d n a - z i, Jnanse, dnin-DAR-a, it is not im possible that dna-zi is merely an orthographic and phonetic ATariant for the Avell known dna(n)se; cf. also SLT 122 iii 13-14. 73 Note, too, that according to line 74 of our myth, Damgalnunna seems to have figured in the earlier part of the story. 7i The ?-mu-un-DAR-a of line 274 is hardly sufficient proof that the passage as a whole is intended to be written in the Emesal dialect, since in all the other cases in the passage nin and en remained in the Eme-KU; cf. also n. 07. 75 Similarly, cf. a - a - d e n -1 i 1 z ? - s a 1 (BBI pi. 11. 33 ), ending a poem dealing with Enlil; dinanna z?-sal (PBS X 4 pi. 30.20), closing an Inanna hymn; kug-dlugal-b?n-da z?-sal ( OECT I pi, 9. 42 ), at the end of a Lugalbanda epic tale. 30</page><page sequence="31">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research Excursus: A Note on Sumerian Lexicology and Lexicography In the introductory note to the Commentary of this study (cf. p. 22)?and the same Avili apply to the other Sumerian studies which I hope to publish in this series?it is stated that it (the Commentary) "assumes on the part of the reader . . . a reasonably critical use of the lexical material gathered in the various Sumerian lexicons." Since the implications of this statement may not be readily apparent to the reader, it is advisable to go into the matter of Sumerian lexicology and lexicography in some detail, especially since at the present moment, the more difficult problems facing the serious student of Sumerian are not in the grammatical, but in the lexical field. This excursus, therefore, Avili begin AArith a brief analysis of the sources aATailable to the modern lexicographer and of the dangers lurking in the uncritical utilization of their contents. It Avili continue with a concrete illus tration of the rather disastrous results which'may follow a superficial approach to the lexical material, and Avili conclude with a brief comment on the method of using the modern lexicons, Avhich may prove of some value to the prospective translator of the Sumerian unilingual material. If Ave examine the sources available to the modern lexicographer, AATe may classify them roughly as folloAvs:?1. Accadian syllabaries of all classes and descriptions, Avhose available copies elate largely from late post-Sumerian periods. 2. Bilingual connected texts, dating largely from late post-Sumerian periods. 3. LTnilingual texts dating from the Sumerian and early post-Sumerian periods, as translated for better or worse by numerous scholars in the course of the past century. 4. Sumerian " ideograms " as adopted and adapted by the Semitic scribes in writing their Ac cadian inscriptions.?Of these four groups, it is the first which has become the back bone of modern lexical compilations, since it is extensive in quantity, and at least on the surface seems readily available and peculiarly appropriate for their purpose. Indeed large parts of these lexicons represent nothing more than a rearrangement according to convenient and conventionalized present-day specifications of the equa tions as rendered in the syllabaries. But it is readily apparent to any serious student of the problem, that a mere listing of the syllabary equations Avili hardly furnish a scientific and reliable col lection of the meanings of the Sumerian Avords. Because of the inherent defects of the syllabary arrangement Avith its system of bare juxtaposition, the Accadian equivalents in many cases represent only an approximation of their Sumerian counterparts. For originally, it is quite obvious, the scribes who composed the syllabaries had to choose their Accadian renderings from the connected Sumerian texts as translated into connected Accadian. When, therefore, these syllabarists came to equate a given verbal root, for example, Avith its corresponding Accadian verbal root, this latter did not render the meaning of the Sumerian root, bare and unmodified, as it necessarily appears in the usual type of syllabary arrangement. The Accadian counterpart may, and frequently does, render the Sumerian root only Avhen modified by a thematic particle, or by an accompanying infix, or as is very often the case, by a preceding substantive Avhich is so closely related to the root that they form a kind of inseparable compound. Secondly, there is little doubt that with the expansion and development Avhich the syllabaries underwent in later post-Sumerian periods, the scribes, utilizing criteria that are not always apparent, tended to add and multiply synonyms in their Accadian columns. It is ATery unlikely, for example, that all the Accadian renderings in the syllabaries of the type k-A-naqu, were actually taken from translations of connected Sumerian texts. Noav obviously enough, the Accadian synonyms are not identical in meaning; they are only approximately synonymous and the degree of correspondence varies considerably from case to case. The greater the degree of variance, the more vague and tenuous becomes its relationship to the Sumerian word whose meaning it is supposed to render. Finally, continued copying and recopying of the syllabaries in the course of cen turies naturally tended to intensify the general confusion. Errors due to careless copying and to misreading are not infrequent. But what is far more serious is the fact that the scribes introduced and developed systems of abbreviations and con tractions in the syllabary arrangements, Avhose principles and rules Ave are just 31</page><page sequence="32">Supplementary Studies No. 1 beginning to apprehend. The fact that at least some of these abbreviations may be due to scribal idiosyncracies and momentary exigencies of time and space only tends to aggraA^ate the situation considerably. Except in the case of more or less obvious equations, therefore, it is only a highly critical approach to the extant syllabary material and a most careful analysis of its renderings that Avili lead to a trustworthy and productiA'e utilization of its contents. A mere mechanical rearrangement of the syllabary equations, such as that almost uniformly practiced by our lexicon com pilers, is not only inadequate, in the long run it may do as much harm as good. If Ave noAv turn to the second group of sources, the bilingual connected texts, it is important to realize that the more recent studies relating to Sumerian grammar and orthography permit a more penetrating analysis of the material than was possible seAreral decades ago. As a result, the lexical equations implicit in it can now be far more accurately formulated. But even our latest and most up to date lexical compilation, ?L, still continues to utilize false or only partly true equations derived from a superficial and misleading comparison of the Sumerian and Accadian lines. Finally, this particular lexicon, in its Arery laudable pioneer effort to utilize Sumerian unilingual material, chooses only too often those translations Avhich by and large are most inaccurate and untrustworthy. As a consequence, even &amp;L, in many ways a monumental achievement, a truly amazing example of Avhat the devotion and self sacrifice of one scholar can accomplish over the years, must be used Avith the greatest caution; only then Avili its contents prove constructive and significant. To illustrate concretely and, it is hoped, effec?Aely, the disastrous consequences that may result from an uncritical approach to the lexical sources, let us turn to the tAventy-one equations listed in &amp;L under the sign ?G (183.2-22): 2). The equation Ad = an?ku is false; it is based on a misunderstanding of the bilingual material. In the passages cited, the Sumerian equivalent for an?ku is written tAvice as ? g - u and once as ? g - g ?. Since the latter writing seems to be nothing more than a phonetic Arariant for A o - u, it follows that it is ? o - u and not ?G AA'hich is to be equated with an?ku (note that this an?ku Avhose meaning is uncertain is not the first person pronoun). As for the equation A g - u = ukul? (&amp;L 183.43), it, too, is based on a misunderstanding of the bilingual passage cited. The ukul? of the Accadian line translates the ku of the Sumerian line; the complex ? G - u - e of the Sumerian line, on the other hand, is translated by burn b?lum, "the possessions of the lord," i.e. the scribe analyzes it as am (Emesal for nig) -u (mun) -a ( k ). The false equation Aq-vl ?ukul?, therefore, re sulted from the failure to realize that in the bilingual connected texts, the order of a given Sumerian complex and its Accadian counterpart is at times inverted, cf. e.g. GSG ? 290, note 2; Poebel, ZA 39. 103, note 1, and AOF 9. 209, note 55. 3), 4), 13), and 22). These four equations Avhich render ?G Avith '?ru, ?rtum, and t?rtum are all false. A careful study of the connected unilingual and bilingual texts proves conclus?A*ely that it is only the compound ? ? ? G, never ? G alone which is involved in these renderings (in CT 10.20, line 00, some textual error is certainly involved; in CT 12. 30 i 35, the complex is the expected l?-? (not da) - kg-g a). One cannot stress too much the harmfulness of equations such as ?G (instead of ? ? ?o) ='?ru, ?o (instead of ki ? ?o) ? r?mti, ig i or bar (instead of igi ? bar) = naplusu, gar (instead of g? ? gar) = kan?su, etc. etc. It is particularly unfortunate that not a feAv of these are actually attested by the syllabaries For the fact is that certain types of syllabaries treat single signs only, and attribute noAv and then to the root represented by a single Sumerian sign a meaning which it has only in a compound formation. It need hardly be pointed out that the uncritical use by a modern translator of such incorrect equa tions as those just described, cannot but prove fatal to his efforts. 0). The equation Ag = asm is false; it is based on a misunderstanding of the bilingual passage cited. It is true that in this passage the scribe seems to render ? G by asru rather than by the expected Sa. But this is only a Aery free translation. Moreover the scribe Avas influenced by the asru of the preceding parallel two-line passage where it correctly renders the Sumerian k i. Note, too, that in lines 5-0 of the same text, the word asru of the Accadian line has no Sumerian equivalent at all, since in the Sumerian idiom the appositional infinitiAe can follow immediately upon the logical antecedent without the use of such classifying Avords as k i, nig ( Emesal ? m ), 1 ? ( Emesal m u 1 u ). 7). The equation ?g = assu is false; it derives from two misunderstood bilingual 32</page><page sequence="33">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research passages. In the first, ? c is actually rendered by the expected sa, not by as-sa as cited in &amp;L. In the second cited passage the word-division as quoted in the lexicons is incorrect; Avhen corrected, it is readily seen that it is the expected na-?m (Emesal writing for nam) which is equated Avith assum. 10). The equation Ag ? bis?tu is false; a correct analysis of the passage cited shoAvs that it is the expected ? m - m ? - a 1 -1 a Avhich is rendered by bis?tu. 11). The equation ?a = lu is false. In the passage cited, the lu of the Accadian line renders quite correctly the particle d ? -, the Emesal form of h?-, in the verbal forms d ? (not ne)- i n - h u 1 and d ? (not n e) - i n - s a g5. As for the ? g which precedes these verbal forms, it represents am, the Emesal form of nig; the Sumerian idiom uses the compound forms nig ? hul and nig ? S a g5 Avhere the Accadian uses the II 1 forms o? lamanu and dam?qu. 12). The equation Ag (?) -?libt)?tu is to be omitted. Whatever the sign in volved may turn out to be, it is not ? g ; none of the knoAvn meanings represented by ?G point even remotely to a meaning such as libb?tu. 16). The equation ? g ? saro.hu is false; in the passage quoted it is the com pound sir ? ?o Avhich is to be equated Avith sar?hu. While a detailed analysis of the compound is still difficult, it is to be noted that it is the Avord sir (= sirhu) which in a sense may be described as the dominant component; certainly ?G by itself cannot be equated Avith sar?hu (cf. comment to equations 3), 4), 13), and 22) above). 17). The equation Ao = rA?iM is false; as the connected texts attest, it is the compound form ki?Ac, not A g by itself, Avhich is to be equated with r?mu. For the syllabary material cited in SL, cf. comment to equations 3), 4), 13), and 22). In the grammatical text cited from ASKT, the scribe, naturally enough, is only interested in the second part of the compound form, i. e. the verbal root. As for the bilingual passage IV R 19, line 10b, the Sumerian clearly has the expected ki ? Ag, not Ag by itself. 18). The equation An ? ramamu is false, it is the compound ki ? ?G Avhich is involved. Moreover, the Avord ram?mu does not signify "schreien"; it is simply a variant Avriting for ra-a-mu "to love.'' The Avriting ma (= wa) for a Avas more or less characteristic of this scribe; thus he Avrites the Accadian equivalent of u r ufl as ma-a-ru, Avhile Sb Avrites it as a-ru. 20). The equation Ag = sal?mu is false; Avhen the Avord division is corrected, the Accadian is seen to read m la-am a-bu-bi "which (Avas) before the flood"; cf. now the correct reading in Langdon, JRAS 02.34, line 14 (reference pointed out to me b}r Frederick Geers of the Oriental Institute). As for the actual equation to be derived from this passage, the broken text is inadequate for a reasonably safe conclusion. To summarize: Of the twenty-one equations listed in the &amp;?. for ?G, six are false altogether; they are based on misinterpreted bilingual comparisons made by one scholar or another in the course of the past century. Seven are false and particularly misleading since they are attested by syllabary material. One is listed as doubtful, but should certainly be eliminated altogether. Seven are correct as cited in ?'L, but in the case of'five of these, i.e. 8), 9), 15), 19), and 21), the tianslator of the connected unilingual texts must bear carefully in mind that ?o, to be read ? m, is simply the Emesal form of n i g, and therefore Avili not be found in any of these five meanings in the ordinary Eine-K u text. Let me note at this point, that the ?G equations were chosen to illustrate the clangers of a superficial approach to the lexical sources largely because the errors are almost self-evident and are therefore relatively easy to analyse and note. Many another sign has listed under it a distressingly large number of false equations; indeed there is hardly a page in our Sumerian lexicons Avhich does not contain one or more of these: they run certainly into the hundreds, and probably into the thousands. All this is said not to disparage our Sumerian lexicons or to detract from the very real service Avhich they have rendered in the past and Avili continue to render in the more immediate future. Because of the huge and more or less amorphous mass of lexical material at our disposal, it is hardly likely that the compilation of a reliable and scientific lexicon based on a thorough linguistic analysis of the syl labaries, bilinguals, and?let this be stressed?unilingual texts, can or Avili be achieved in the very near future; in all probability it Avili take the coordinated efforts and labors of more than one scholar over a period of many years to bring it 33</page><page sequence="34">Supplementary Studies No. 1 into being. Our present lexicons, therefore, will have to do service for years to come. All the more reason, then, to underline and clarify their most significant feature, Avhich is that they are primarily only collections of references to the lexical sources. Except therefore in case of the more obvious and well known renderings, each equation must be carefully scrutinized and Aerified before it is utilized. Thus it Avili not do for the prospective translator of a Sumerian unilingual text, when trying to get at the meaning of a Avord in a passage before him, simply to look through the list of equations cited in the lexicons and choose the one which on the surface seems to fit the context, or rather his preconceived notion of Avhat the context may be. He must in almost all cases go back to the original source cited in the lexicon in order to see Avhether the equation is correctly adduced; it may well prove to be a false equation resulting from a misunderstanding of the bilinguals or syllabaries involved. Even then, after a careful study of the original sources, the serious stu dent will find only too often that his conclusions are no more than tentative in character. But at least he will haAre escaped those errors and pitfalls which in the past haAre frustrated the efforts of more than one Avell-meaning Sumerian scholar. 34</page><page sequence="35">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AB Barton, George A.
