<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edward H. Madden Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker: A Comparative Study The intellectual and personal relations between Emerson and Parker have been a matter of great interest to scholars in philoso- phy, English literature and the history of ideas for many years. Many claims have been made - some a bit strained and lame - but the commentators who make significant points can be separated roughly into two camps: those who see the two men as present- ing essentially the same viewpoints and those who see Parker as so different from Emerson epistemically that they doubt he should be called a transcendentalist.1 Sometimes the arguments hinge on prior definitions of what is to count as "transcendentalism," a use- less enterprise since such definitions, like those of pragmatism, are like accordians expanding and contracting differently according to the tune being played. The position I should like to defend is that Emerson and Parker are much alike in their epistemic com- mitments and that Parker's deviations, though quite marked and significant, are not inconsistent with the beliefe the two men shared. Some of Parker's deviations are fascinating and relevant; some are dull and irrelevant but none turn Emerson and Parker into epistemic antagonists. Emerson and Parker were definitely antagonists on metaphysical issues; indeed they were so far apart that it is remarkable how rarely commentators have dwelt on these issues. Emerson was an idealist and exhibited pantheistic tendencies while Parker was a natural realist and believed in a transcendent God. These incredi- Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, Spring 1993, Vol. XXIX, No. 2.</page><page sequence="2">180 Edward H. Madden iblc differences, I shall argue, have gone unheralded because of the hitherto unappreciated fact that Parker, unlike Emerson, was deeply influenced by Victor Cousin, the pre-eminent philosopher of France during the first half of the nineteenth century, as well as by Coleridge and Carlyle, standard influences on both men. The epistemic tension and metaphysical opposition left their marks on the personal relations between Emerson and Parker. As we shall see, while they respected each other to a great extent, they admired each other best at a distance; at close range their personalities did not mesh and they never had the easy, long-term friendship for which Parker, the younger man, yearned and hoped would materialize. 1. The main tension between Emerson and Parker is not difficult to discern: while both accepted Schelling's epistemic distinction, via Coleridge, between Reason and understanding, Emerson saw virtue mainly in the former, in men's capacity to grasp intuitively apriori truths about nature and spirit, and mainly denigrated the latter, the capacity to apprehend facts of the sensory empirical world, be they so-called truths of biography, history, natural sci- ence (as distinct from physics), or revealed religions, depending, as they do, on alleged historical truths. Intuition yields knowledge directly while historical inquiry (which includes any empirical en- terprise) is circumstantial and hence inconclusive. Intuition re- quires no reasons, arguments, proofs, or discursive elements of any kind; these logical gambits belong instead to the understanding and often constitute useless efforts to bolster inconclusive results. While never wavering in his belief that Reason or intuition is of primary importance, Parker also stressed the importance of the understanding, in conjunction with Reason, for supplying suppor- tive and illustrative insights. He also believed that sensations were often the occasion for eliciting apriori intuitions. Moreover, he thought the understanding important in establishing truths in sci- ence and everyday life that are quite useful and yet cannot be</page><page sequence="3">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 181 known by intuition. For all these reasons Parker constantly used arguments, demonstrations, inferences and any other discursive methods including statistical analysis and Higher Criticism of the Bible. The difference between Emerson and Parker can be stated most succinctly by saying Emerson was ahistorical in outlook while Parker combined ahistorical and historical inquiry in a con- sistent way. Unlike numerous critics, I claim that epistemically Emerson and Parker were quite different but not incompatible. That Emerson was concerned primarily with Reason and was an- tagonistic to historical inquiry can be established both by his innu- merable statements to that effect and by examining any of his main philosophical themes. The first words in his first published work, Nature, show the prominence of this element in his thought: Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. . . . Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of in- sight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs? . . . why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also.2 Here is a small sample of similar statements that constantly reiter- ate the theme of his primary concern: "the materialist insists on facts, on history, on the force of circumstances and the animal wants of man; the idealist on the power of Thought and of Will . . . ."3 "Thus do all things preach the indifferency of circum- stances. The man is all."4 "[Man] will learn that there is no pro- fane history; that all history is sacred; that the universe is repre- sented in an atom, in a moment of time" - and "he will weave no longer a spotted life of shreds and patches, but he will live with a divine unity."5 Like all of his major thematic pieces, the "Divinity School Ad- dress" also clearly illustrates Emerson's anti-historical, anti- sensational, anti-understanding orientation. "But, with whatever</page><page sequence="4">182 Edward H. Madden exception, it is still true that tradition characterizes the preaching of this country; that it comes out of memory, and not out of the soul; that it aims at what is usual, and not at what is necessary and eternal; that thus historical Christianity destroys the power of preaching, by withdrawing it from the exploration of the moral nature of man."6 Historical Christianity, he thought, ignores the doctrine of the oversoul and insists on the divinity of Christ as a unique historical event whereas in fact not Christ only but every- one is partly divine. Historical Christianity "has dwelt, it dwells, with noxious exaggeration about the person of Jesus."7 The result, Emerson claimed, is that the church has thus lost the intuitive ba- sis of truth and heralds the divinity of an historical personage by the miracles he is supposedly able to perform. When Jesus spoke of miracles, however, he really meant that all life is a miracle and when the apostles claimed to be filled with the Holy Ghost they simply meant that all men are inspired. Emerson, and Parker also, never tired of reinterpreting Christian doctrine. It would be a mistake to think that Emerson always denigrated empirical and historical inquiry. He thought he had a way of bringing some of it under the auspices of his grand vision, though to do so he had to talk about wit rather than intuition. "The Times are the masquerade of the Eternities; trivial to the dull, tokens of noble and majestic agents to the wise . . . The Times - the nations, manners, institutions, opinions, votes, are to be stud- ied as omens, as sacred leaves, whereon a weighty sense is in- scribed, if we have the wit and the love to search it out."8 In spite of these fine-sounding phrases, however, Emerson rarely act- ed in accord with them. After all, he had a prize orchard of pears, and he was deeply interested in learning what method of ripening pears, which had to be picked early, was most successful. As a member of the committee on pears at the Middlesex fair he and the other committee members required contributors to make full written reports on their methods of ripening pears.9 Was he look-</page><page sequence="5">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 183 ing for tokens or omens, or sacred leaves when he read which method of ripening had been most successful in the past? Though Emerson denigrated the importance of historical in- quiry, as we have seen, he by no means dismissed its value. In ad- dition to looking for tokens and omens in historical events, he made numerous social, political, and psychological generalizations and liked to picture "great men" as representative of their age or epoch. He was not very successful, however, in these historical en- terprises. In Representative Men, for example, he never shows how his five men successfully represent different sectors of civilization. "Montaigne, for example, he treats as a representative skeptic without any consideration of whether France, or western Europe, in the sixteenth century was predominently skeptical in temper; and even to the word 'skeptic' he gives an idiosyncratic defini- tion."10 Though he was interested in historical studies, for better or for worse, it must be kept in mind that Emerson always reject- ed the notion that historical or any other empirical studies could corroborate, sustain, or illustrate the basic intuitions of Reason. Parker, like Emerson, distinguished between intuitive apriori knowledge and the lower knowledge of the phenomenal world through sensation. In "The Position and Duties of the American Scholar" Parker wrote that the transcendentalist has a respect for human nature above human history. In "Experience As a Minis- ter" he elaborated this theme: "I have sought my authority in the nature of man - in facts of consciousness within me, and in facts of observation in the human world without. To me the material world and the outward history of man do not supply a sufficient revelation of God, nor warrant me to speak of infinite perfection. It is only from the nature of man, from facts of intuition, that I can gather this greatest of all truths, as I find it in my conscious- ness reflected back from Deity itself."11 According to Parker, there are various sorts of apriori intui- tions - epistemic, metaphysical, ethical, and religious, the last be- ing of primary concern.12 We straightforwardly intuit God as not simply infinite in the sense of omnipresent but also as infinitely</page><page sequence="6">184 Edward H. Madden good, loving, and powerful. The reason man has these apriori and necessary intuitions is that he is himself a fragment of the divine. Empirical philosophers, who think nothing is in the intellect which is not first in the senses, Parker continued, are guided only by experience and hence base their political and ethical views on historical events. But "human history shows what has been, not what should be or will be.Ml3 Thus the transcendentalist depends instead on human nature and its apriori endowments - only in this way can one intuit, for example, that all people are endowed with natural rights. The whole career of Christianity, Parker said, has been based on accepting historical facts, the authenticity of the Scriptures, and the appearance of miracles; but if religious beliefs are intuited as necessary truths then any alleged historical fact that conflicts with such beliefs must be rejected. And Parker rejected almost all of the alleged historical facts that conflicted with the intuitions of reason. "I take not the Bible for my master, nor yet the Church; nor even Jesus of Nazareth for my master. ... I try all things by the human faculties. . . . Has God given us anything better than our nature? " 14 "The inspiration of Jesus Christ could not differ in kind from that of Socrates, only in degree. He had much inspira- tion; Socrates little."15 Parker's views thus far seem reasonably close to Emerson's and he restated these commitments throughout his essays, sermons, orations, letters, and journal. Nevertheless there are epistemic dif- ferences between the two men, some quite significant; the issue is whether these differences are incompatible or only divergent. Sev- eral commentators have claimed that these epistemic differences make their works overall incompatible and thus (using Emerson as the touchstone) eliminate Parker as a transcendentalist.16 The claim is that Parker used discursive reasoning to elaborate intui- tions, to formulate empirical arguments from design, and to de- fend the historical critiques of Christianity by the Higher Critics in order to elaborate, bolster or confirm intuitions, thus rejecting the firm distinction between Reason and understanding. Parker</page><page sequence="7">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 185 certainly did all these things, but after examining his arguments I will claim that they in no way contravene the distinction between Reason and understanding so sacred to the transcendentalists. Parker referred to certain "truths of demonstration that use in- tuitions as points of departure." Emerson disliked arguments and demonstrations - what did Parker have in mind here? He simply meant that intuitions can be expanded into further criticisms of his- torical claims. For example, if we know intuitively that God is infi- nitely loving, good, and powerful then there can be no ultimate evil in the world. Hence we may infer that historical Christianity is faulty since it permits irremediable evil and injustice in many of its concepts, including hell, eternal damnation, the devil, the utter de- pravity of man, and the doctrine of the elect. This inference in turn entails that the Christian God is not wholly good. "Nay, as 'many are called, and but few chosen' so it would appear that [the devil] was the successful rival of God, and got more souls than the Father Himself at the end of the world." "Of course, God must have created the Devil out of his (God's) own substance, so there must have been a devilish element in God at the beginning."17 These inferences whether acceptable or not arc in no way in- compatible with Emerson's thought and standard Coleridge doc- trine. An apriori intuition of Reason provides the premise of the arguments and if the arguments were legitimate they would con- stitute a stunning criticism of historical Christianity. Parker's ar- gument would seem to be most effectively applied to the doc- trines of the utter depravity of man, eternal damnation, and the doctrine of the elect; for these doctrines seem to entail an irre- ducible and irretrievable sense of evil and injustice. But Parker paid a high price to avoid these pitfalls of orthodox religion since he necessarily committed himself to philosophical opti- mism, the view that there is no single unresolved evil in the world. God works out the ultimate harmony. Emerson agreed with the ultimate harmony viewpoint but never used it as an ar- gument against historical Christianity. He could never shed the erroneous belief that any discursive argument must belong to</page><page sequence="8">186 Edward H. Madden the domain of understanding. Commentators view with alarm Parker's arguments from design since they are empirical in nature and thereby tainted. Let us have an example of his argument and see if it is tainted. Parker had nu- merous formulations of the design argument, rarely argued in de- tail since the facts seemed to him to speak so strongly of order, design, and goodness that they fairly shouted the existence of an infinitely good and loving designer. His most charming rendition of the argument is a literary one that is worthy of Emerson's gen- ius for stating spiritual truths metaphorically: "At the end of my arms," Parker wrote, "are two major prophets, ten minor proph- ets, each of them pointing the transcendental philosopher to the infinite God, of which he [also] has consciousness without the logical process of induction."18 In my opinion Parker's empirical argument in no way contra- venes the distinction between Reason and understanding; the commentators who believe that they do miss a crucial premise in Parker's arguments. Parker always and everywhere insisted that in- tuitions are the touchstone of knowledge - "philosophy is truer than sensation" - and that empiricists, or sensationalists, can never achieve knowledge. They may reach generalizations but never uni- versals because on their view there is no way of justifying the be- lief that the future will resemble the past. The transcendentalists, on the other hand, believed that God is infinite in the sense of omnipresent, as well as infinitely good, loving, and powerful, and hence God lends the necessary stability to the world to justify the belief that the future will resemble the past, a belief denied to the empiricist. Hence the transcendentalist can use empirical studies quite legitimately, whenever relevant, since by virtue of the uni- formity-of-nature intuition these studies are able to reach univer- sals, not simply generalizations. "A priori [intuition] admits the uniformity of the action of nature; and its laws are a priori known to be universal, and not general alone."19 Parker himself had no illusions that the design argument of- fered independent confirmation of a person's intuitive knowledge</page><page sequence="9">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 187 of God's existence since the argument is already implied by the apriori knowledge that God is perfect. "We find in Nature that every want is naturally supplied. That is, there is something exter- nal to each created being to answer all the internal wants of that being. This conclusion could have been anticipated without expe- rience, since it follows from the perfections of the Deity, that all his direct works must be perfect."20 To be sure, experience bears it out, Parker thought, but that means very little since for him no empirical result could ever overturn an apriori intuition. It would be a mistake, however, to think that Parker always subordinated empirical and inductive inquiry to apriori intui- tions - nothing could be further from the truth. After all, there are many factual matters that have no relevance whatever to intui- tive truths, and these matters must be settled by aposteriori, ex- perimental methods (which can reach universals rather than gener- alizations by virtue of the Uniformity premise). But any empirical generalization, no matter how sloppily made, can be universalized by the Uniformity principle, so good inductive procedures, with their own intrinsic rules, are also required to justify turning a gen- eralization into a universal. In his article "Transcendentalism" Parker criticized fellow transcendentalists who denigrated under- standing to such an extent that they used shoddy empirical meth- ods to establish factual claims that had no relevance to intuitions. They mistakenly thought that they could ignore scientific method and spin facts out of their imagination. There is little doubt that he had Emerson in mind as well as other transcendentalists. Commentators also worry about Parker's intense interest in, and his contributions to, Higher Criticism which throws doubts on the authenticity of the Scriptures and interprets the Bible as a function of the culture in which it originated and developed. But again this support of the transcendentalist critiques of historical Christianity is empirical in nature and cannot be used to support knowledge that originates from a higher source. Let us investigate in some detail Parker's allegiance to Higher Criticism for it played a large role in his life.</page><page sequence="10">188 Edward H. Madden Parker was much influenced by Wilhelm de Wette's A Critical and Historical Introduction to the Canonical Scriptures of the Old Testament and David Friedrich Strauss's Life of Jesus, though his erudition was so great there was scarcely any figure among either the Higher Critics or the orthodox clergy in Germany with whose work he was unacquainted. Parker translated and annotated de Wette's influential book, adding new bibliographical material and treatises of his own, and published his "enlarged" de Wette in the United States in 1843. He was impressed by Strauss but thought he went too far in humanizing the life of Jesus. Parker's accep- tance of the Higher Criticism generally is evident throughout his work. Here are a few examples of its influence. An orthodox Christian "never fancies God's Spirit always takes new forms, each suited to the age, climate, etc."21 "No doubt the Bible contained the imperfection of the men and ages concerned in writing it. The hay tastes of the meadow where it grew, of the weather when it was made, and smells of the barn wherein it has been kept; nay, even the breath of the oxen housed underneath comes down to the market in every load."22 I soon found that the Bible is a collection of quite heter- ogeneous books, most of them anonymous, or bearing names of doubtful authors, collected none knows how, or when, or by whom; united more by caprice than any phil- osophic or historical method, so that it is not easy to see why one ancient book is kept in the Canon and another kept out. I found no unity of doctrine in the several parts; the Old Testament 'reveals' one form of religion, and the New Testament one directly its opposite; and in the New Testament itself, I found each writer had his own individuality, which appears not only in the style, the form of thought, but quite as much in the doctrines, the substance of thought, where no two are well agreed.23 It is not at all clear why Parker's commitment to Higher Criti- cism destroys the Reason-understanding distinction. On the con-</page><page sequence="11">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 189 trary, it seems perfectly compatible with it. Parker construed the Higher Criticism to be a scientific enterprise, an effort to discover the origins and development of the Bible objectively, indepen- dently of any supernatural commitments, the way the history of any other tradition is discovered. It is a science in the sense that it tries to explain by textual analysis and historical events, plus their relationships, how a tradition came to pass and why it had one ca- reer rather than another. It is scientific because it is entirely sub- ject to the laws or rules of historical inquiry. The first law is not to fudge the evidence, as the authors of the Bible are found to do on many more than one occasion. He pointed out places in the Books of Samuel where prophecies were clearly added to the texts after the events had occurred.24 He gives numerous similar cases of "cooking the evidence." The Higher Critics, on the other hand, sincerely tried to find what actually happened, no doubt not always successfully but, when foiling, failing from lack of evi- dence, not from departing from scientific requirements. It is crucial to see that Parker believed that scientific history, though an empirical inquiry, yields knowledge that could not be achieved by any apriori intuition. He was critical of fellow tran- scendentalists: "They have tried to divine the constitution of the world, to do without sensational experience in matters where knowledge depends on that and that is the sine qua non."25 Park- er was claiming that empirical, factual inquiries can yield knowl- edge when the proper scientific rules are followed; knowledge, to be sure, without the necessity of apriori knowledge, but knowl- edge nevertheless. This claim, it might seem, does break down the distinction between Reason and understanding, though in fact it would simply modify it in a sane way. We may have "higher" and "lower" types of knowledge, but we cannot have higher knowledge about matters of fact. But the major point to keep in mind is that Parker himself believed that we can make inferences from our religious intuitions to the dubitable nature of historical religion. Hence the historico- textual findings of the Higher Crit- ics simply corroborate what we already knew but establishes it in</page><page sequence="12">190 Edward H. Madden a detailed fashion not accessible to intuition. For Parker there are no intuitions of matters of fact26; but from intuitions that God is infinitely good, powerful, and omnipresent one can know by infer- ence that historical Christianity is at least in part false. We can in- fer certain ways in which it is false, as we have already seen Parker do concerning the problem of evil. But the specific details of the natural history of Christianity can be known only through scientif- ic inquiry - an inquiry which yields significant knowledge, albeit not indubitable knowledge. Parker's endorsement of Higher Criticism, I submit, is not in- compatible with Emerson's views. To be sure, Emerson disdained discursive arguments and corroboration from other sources, but to take his personal inclinations on this matter as definitive of transcendentalism would be simplistic. Moreover, if rejection of historical studies and techniques were to be taken as characteristic of transcendentalism then numerous other people generally in- cluded in this category would be excluded, including Orestes Brownson, F.H. Hedge, James Freeman Clarke, and W.H. Chan- ning. Emerson himself, for that matter, was much interested in history and practical affairs though, unlike Parker, he had no justi- fication for accepting any conclusions from literature which de- pended upon empirical inquiry. In any case, it seems pointless to argue who were and who were not transcendentalists; I have been content to argue that Emerson's and Parker's views are not epis- temically incompatible. 2. To find the genuine incompatibilities between the views of Emerson and Parker one must turn from their epistemic commit- ments to their metaphysics. As we have seen earlier, Emerson was an idealist and exhibited pantheistic tendencies while Parker was a natural realist and believed in a transcendent God. It is difficult to imagine two philosophers being farther apart than these two men were on metaphysical issues. Emerson's Idealism figured prominently in his first publication.</page><page sequence="13">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 191 In Nature he wrote that one can easily doubt the testimony of the senses - after all, one can never test his sensations to see if they are adequate to what might exist beyond them since one has no other way of apprehending it. "In my utter impotence to test the authenticity of the report of my senses, to know whether the impressions they make on me correspond with outlying objects, what difference does it make, whether Orion is up there in heav- en, or some god paints the image in the firmament of the soul."27 This statement almost sounds skeptical in import, but to the practiced eye Emerson was only leading up to idealism. Any attention to ideas, Emerson thought, soon breaks down the "des- potism of the senses." "It is a sufficient account of that Appear- ance we call the World, that God will teach a human mind, and so makes it the receiver of a certain number of congruent sensa- tions, which we call sun and moon, man and woman, house and trade."28 Appearance should not be thought of as flimsy shadows unstable and impermanent. "It is the uniform effect of culture of the human mind, not to shake our faith in the stability of particu- lar phenomena, as of heat, water, azote; but to lead us to regard nature as phenomena, not a substance; to attribute necessary exis- tence to spirit; to esteem nature as an accident and an effect."29 The poet reinforces philosophical idealism. Instead of thoughts conforming to things, the poet has things conforming to thought. Matter is plastic to the touch of imagination; thus both the poet and philosopher convert the objects of sense into spiritual truths. Vestiges of pantheism occur in much of Emerson's prose work including "The Oversoul" where he wrote, "that Unity, that Over-Soul, within which every man's particular being is contained and made one with all other" and "the act of seeing, and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one."30 Emerson often referred to union with "Universal Be- ing," a name designed better than "God" to avoid the suggestion of personality; the individual in his ultimate religious experience becomes one with Being not with a Being. Emerson sometimes made his pantheistic point by using the Neoplatonic concept of</page><page sequence="14">192 Edward H. Madden emanation - "A fact," he wrote, " is the end or last issue of Spir- it." In his Journal he continued: HA fact we said was the terminus of spirit. A man, I, am the remote circumference, the skirt, the thin suburb or frontier post of God but go inward and I find the ocean; I lose my individuality in its waves. God is unity, but al- ways works in variety. I go inward until I find Unity universal, that Is before the World was; I come outward to this body a point of variety."31 Thus even as an individual one is simply a var- iation of Being. One might say that Emerson tended to depend less upon Plotinus in later years, but for a reason easily explained away - later he was generally dealing with other topics. Pantheistic references also occur in Emerson's poetry, illustrative of his Ger- man Romanticism, absolute idealism (where space and time be- come illusions), Neoplatonism, and oriental mysticism. His poem most frequently referred to is "Brahma": If the red slayer think he slays, Or if the slain think he is slain, They know not well the subtle ways I keep, and pass, and turn again. Far or forgot to me is near; Shadow and sunlight are the same; The vanished gods to me appear; And one to me are shame and fame. They reckon ill who leave me out; When me they fly, I am the wings; I am the doubter and the doubt And I the hymn the Brahmin sings. The strong gods pine for my abode, And pine in vain the sacred Seven; But thou, meek lover of the good! Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.32</page><page sequence="15">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 193 By contrast, Parker emphatically rejected both idealism and pantheism. He was in accord with the common man; he was a natural realist and stated his position without qualification. Tran- scendentalism, he wrote, "starts with the maxim that the senses acquaint us with body, and therefrom the mind gives us the idea of substance, answering to an objective reality. Thus is the certainty of the material world made sure of."33 How completely differently "transcendentalism" was set on its metaphysical course by Emerson and Parker! Emerson went toward absolute idealism while Parker embraced the Scottish realist tradition of Thomas Reid. The two Americans did not disagree on the importance of intuitive truth, they simply had incompatible intuitions. This fact nicely points up the epistemic similarity between the Scottish tradition and transcendentalism and their metaphysical diver- gence. However it was not Thomas Reid who influenced Parker but Victor Cousin, a French advocate of Scottish realism who has often been misinterpreted as an absolute idealist partly be- cause he used the word "absolute," so firmly fixed in people's minds with absolute idealism, for a transcendent God. Let us ex- amine Cousin's views briefly in order to see the extent of his in- fluence on Parker. In perception Cousin closely linked sensation and apriori contri- butions of the mind. I sense the properties red and round, say, and this occurrence is the occasion for the immediate activation of a nativistic epistemic response (intuitions, in transcendental terms) of seeing these properties as inhering in physical objects or substances that exist independently of mind. Hence the natural realism of the ordinary man, without his being aware of it, consti- tutes synthetic apriori knowledge. The objectivity and indepen- dence of space is accounted for in a similar fashion: perceiving an object provides the occasion for activating the intellect's apriori input of perceiving the object as in objective space. We can have space without objects - empty space is a perfectly respectable con- cept - but we cannot have objects without space, which thus acts as a necessary condition for the perception of objects.34 Parker</page><page sequence="16">194 Edward H. Madden not only took over Cousin's view of perception and space but also appropriated the Frenchman's terminology of the sensation as be- ing the "occasion" for activating nativistic input (or intuition). According to Parker, transcendentalism maintains that the mind "is not a smooth tablet on which sensation writes its experience, but is a living principle which of itself originates ideas when the senses present the occasion."35 Thus the sensation of properties triggers the intuition of substance and of space and so on. Parker frequently followed Cousin in suggesting that the perception of finite being triggers the intuition of infinite being on which we are dependent, and he accepted Cousin's use of "Spiritualism" (after Cousin had dropped the term "Electicism") as a descriptive term for his own philosophy.36 Parker also used synonymously the concepts of "truths of intuition" and "truths of spontaneous con- sciousness," the latter being Cousin's customary usage, and occa- sionally used the term "induction," as Cousin did, to generalize and classify the synthetic apriori truths of intuition or "spontane- ous reason."37 Parker deserves credit for being one of the first to see the epistemic similarities of transcendentalism and Scottish re- alism - or, as it is usually called, the tradition of commonsense, where Reid's principles of commonsense have an unusual mean- ing, being characterized as both synthetic and apriori. Parker insisted quite emphatically that he was not a pantheist; he was aware that Cousin had been persistently charged with holding this belief which Cousin had spent his whole career in de- nying, and Parker was trying to avoid a similar fate. The reason both men had to make denials of pantheism is because they held views about creation which could be interpreted in that vein if one were not acquainted with the whole thrust of their metaphys- ics. Through interesting arguments Cousin concluded that God could not have created the world ex nihilo. Then comes his most notorious passage: God creates; he creates in virtue of his creative power, and he draws the universe, not from nonentity, but from himself, who is absolute existence. His distinguishing</page><page sequence="17">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 195 characteristic being an absolute creative force, which can not but pass into activity, it follows, not that the creation is possible, but that it is necessary.38 Now, must one conclude, as Sir William Hamilton did, that "on this theory, God is not distinct from the world; the creature is the modification of the creator."39 Cousin himself was convinced that this conclusion does not follow. To show why it does not he struck an analogy between human and divine creative causality. Man causes things to come into being and in so doing he calls up something of himself and imparts it to that which he creates.40 When Bach, for example, produced his Magnificat, the work owed its entire being to him; without Bach it would never have come to be yet we say only that the work is Bach's and would not ever think of saying it is Bach. We acknowledge that the Magnificat in some crucial respect "bears his stamp" - in such a manner, likewise, as "the universe is an imperfect reflection, though a reflection nonetheless, of the divine essence."41 Nor was Bach spent in this act of creation, along with many other such creations. Similarly, "the internal principle of causation, while de- veloping in and through its acts, retains that which makes it prin- ciple and cause, and is not at all absorbed into its effects. . . . God remains whole, in his essential unity and triplicity."42 Parker wrote along lines strikingly similar to Cousin's. To Eliza- beth Peabody he wrote in 1840, "The idea of something created out of nothing is an absurdity. God created the world - out of Himself so He is still in it, creating every day - not only worketh hitherto but now likewise."43 Like Cousin, however, he never in- tended any pantheistic overtones. In spite of his rejection of the supernatural elements of Christianity, he revered Christ as the greatest exponent and practitioner of absolute religion, sometimes giving him the traditional sobriquet "Messiah" as an honorary ti- tle, so to speak. And he conceived of God as having the eminent- ly distinctive attributes of infinite power, goodness, and love. To William Silsbee he wrote in 1841 a discerning description of the</page><page sequence="18">196 Edward H. Madden pantheism of absolute idealism and rejected it, though he thought it less obnoxious than orthodox Christianity. H I am no Pantheist, nor ever was. . . . Now, for my part, I find a tertium quid, and am no more troubled by Pantheism or Anthropomorphism than, at noonday, the evening and morning twilight trouble me. ... I think the instinctive feeling and reason lead direct to God - God all-wise, all-powerful, all-good - who is the good, the beautiful, the true. But they do not define him, except so far as to distin- guish the idea of God from all other ideas, either actual or possi- ble. Love, wisdom, &amp;c, in Him who made the stars, must be very different from what I feel and know. Now I bow to this Be- ing and live in him, but I cannot 'by searching find out God unto perfection,1 i.e., perfectly. We see that there is nothing but the Creator and the Creation. I feel no desire, as some do, to attempt to simplify the matter still more, and find only a Creator. Crea- tion is to me the glass through which I see God. I can know much about the manifestations of the Creator in the Creation; but can only know of God that He is perfect"44 Did Parker ever acknowledge his indebtedness to Cousin? Nev- er adequately in his published work. Sometimes he thought he was more indebted to Kant than Cousin,45 but he was quite mis- taken - or simply intended to mislead - since his synthetic apriori notions were not Kant's but were usually Reid's via Cousin. Occa- sionally he was critical of Cousin. In his "Experience as a Minis- ter" he wrote that from orthodox precincts like Cambridge and Princeton Cousin "could not receive needed criticism, but only vulgar abuse."46 His most accurate estimate appears in a letter in which he discussed the relative merits of Coleridge and Cousin. The writings of Coleridge were reprinted in America, all of them "aids to reflection," and brilliant with the scat- tered sparks of genius; they incited many to think, more especially young Trinitarian ministers; and, spite of the lack of both historic and philosophic accuracy, and the utter absence of all proportion in his writings; spite of his haste, his vanity, prejudice, sophistry, confusion, and opi-</page><page sequence="19">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 197 um - he yet did great service in New England, helping to emancipate enthralled minds. The works of Cousin, more systematic, and more profound as a whole, and far more catholic and comprehensive, continental, not insular, in his range, also became familiar to the Americans - reviews and translations going where the eloquent original was not heard - and helped to free the young mind from the gross sensationalism of the academic philosophy on one side, and the grosser supernatualism of the ecclesiastic theology on the other.47 More than Emerson, Parker realized their real philosophical differences. He had nothing but contempt for Emerson's mysti- cism, pantheism, be it that of the absolute idealists or the orien- tal romantics; to him what Emerson wrote in this vein was soft and fishy and appeared to a man with a good hold on common sense as sheer nonsense. Emerson nowhere seemed to appreciate in any significant way the extent of differences between him and Parker on metaphysical grounds. What bothered him was the way Parker kept using historical and scientific studies to bolster intuitionism, which, however, as I have already argued, are per- fectly compatible with Emerson's sacred distinction between Rea- son and understanding. 4. Philosophical and personality differences, along with shared commitments, made the personal relations between Emerson and Parker quite complex: each was both attracted and repelled by the other. In the case of Parker this ambivalence was less pronounced than Emerson's and remained constant throughout his life. With Emerson, who vacillated through the years, the ambivalence was more pronounced, one valence alternating with the other without discernible directionality. First, I shall trace out in strict chronological order how the two men felt and acted toward each other from 1838 until Parker's</page><page sequence="20">198 Edward H. Madden death in 1860, including as well Emerson's journal references to Parker after 1860. With the relevant information in hand I shall attempt some judgments of relative worth but shall be primarily interested in explicating the relations between their attitudes and acts, on the one hand, and their intellectual and moral commit- ments and their temperaments, on the other. After hearing Emerson's Divinity School Address in 1838 Park- er noted in his diary that Emerson had "surpassed himself as much as he surpasses others in the general way. ... So beautiful, and just, so true."48 In 1838 he wrote George E. Ellis that Emer- son's address was "a little exaggerated, with some philosophical untruths, it seems to me; but the noblest, the most inspiriting strain I have ever listed to."49 Emerson published Nature in 1836 and The Transcendental Club came into being the same year, the charter members being Emerson, George Ripley, F.H. Hedge, Bronson Alcott, Convers Francis, J.F. Clark, and Orestes Brownson. Parker was tardily in- vited to join the club, a number of others in addition to the orig- inal group having been invited before him. At one meeting Parker became impatient with Alcott's foggy thinking, and Emerson re- called, "He wound himself around Alcott like an anaconda: you could hear poor Alcott's bones crunch."50 In 1839 Parker suggested Emerson as editor of the Dial, the new transcendental journal, but Emerson declined and Margaret Fuller became editor. The Dial was launched in 1840, and Emer- son was delighted with its early content. In the summer of 1840 George Ripley, Christopher Cranch, and Parker visited Emerson, but Parker was disappointed; Emerson could talk of nothing but the Dial and to no one but Ripley, and even in the Dial he ad- mired all the wrong things. Still he thought Emerson looked as divine as ever.51 In 1842 Fuller resigned as editor of the Dial and suggested Parker or Emerson to replace her. In order to prevent Parker from becoming editor Emerson assumed what for him was an onerous task. As editor he asked Parker for contributions but not too enthusiastically, and Parker contributed less than previ-</page><page sequence="21">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 199 ously.52 In fact, Parker's respect for the Dial had waned; he con- sidered too much of its content as misty and windy. He thought the journal a little on the precious side and could not stand Al- cott's "Orphic Sayings" or Thoreau's poetry. Infighting aside, Emerson wrote in his journal in 1842 that Boston seemed much less like a mean place when one could meet and chat with Parker on the street.53 The Massachusetts Quarterly Review was launched in the sum- mer of 1847 with Parker as editor. It was to be a successor of sorts to the Dial but with less mist and wind and more substance. Emerson was supposedly one of the editors but his sole contribu- tions were an editorial address and a brief notice of Arthur Clough's poems. The Review dealt much more with politics than the Dial had done, and numerous articles were concerned with different aspects of the slavery issue. Literature was not neglected, however; there were critical essays on Emerson, Hawthorne, Tho- reau, and others. In 1849 Parker extolled in his review of Emer- son the intellectual and moral sincerity of the sage of Concord, as well as his passionate concern for mankind. But he criticized Emerson for his lack of historical understanding and limited ac- quaintance with books, as well as a lack of rigor and discipline in his thinking.54 In "The Position and Duties of the American Scholar" Parker wrote that Emerson was to be deeply admired for his impressive knowledge of the uniqueness of American culture, his own deep roots in that culture, and in the common people who were its backbone. He was America's best representative au- thor. "Emerson takes his majestic intuitions of truth and justice, which transcend the experience of the ages, and expounds them to the mechanics' apprentices, to the factory girls at Lowell and Chicopee, and to the merchants' clerks at Boston."55 From the late '40 's till his death in 1860 Parker devoted the bulk of his energies to abolitionist goals. He was no believer in non-violence, and in concert with others forcibly rescued runaway slaves from federal marshals in Boston. While disapproving of vio- lence, Emerson, appalled by the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and</page><page sequence="22">200 Edward H. Madden Daniel Webster's support of it, felt drawn more closely to Parker, according to Ralph Rusk, because of Parker's courageous fight against slavery.56 In 1852 Parker wrote at the beginning of his Ten Sermons of Religion: "To Ralph Waldo Emerson, with admiration for his genius, and with kindly affection for what in him is fer nobler than genius, this volume is dedicated by his friend, Theodore Parker." In one of the sermons in the book Parker wrote that Emerson had "sent a great religious influence to many a house and field and town, and youths and maids rejoice in his electric touch. . . . [He is] the most original, as well as religious, of American writers."57 Emerson and Parker both belonged to the Town and Country Club which in a few weeks after its inception in 1849 numbered one hundred and twenty members. Contrary to appearances, sev- eral candidates were denied admission; Emerson serenely vetoed Elizabeth Peabody and Mary Lowell Putnam. The club was short lived and crumbled cheerfully into bankruptcy. In 1853 Emerson declined Parker's request to arrange for a revival of the Transcen- dental Club. The exclusive Saturday Club followed in 1856 with Emerson as a charter member, while Parker never received an in- vitation though Emerson pushed hard for people who had what he considered good manners. Besides Emerson, the charter mem- bers of the Saturday Club included Louis Agassiz, Richard Henry Dana, J.S. Dwight, James Russell Lowell, J.L. Motley, and Benja- min Peirce. Longfellow, Holmes, Whittier, and Hawthorne joined later though Hawthorne attended meetings irregularly and unen- thusiastically. Parker had his own salon in the parlor of his Exeter Place house- Wendell Phillips, Charles Sumner, Samuel Gridley Howe, Julia Ward Howe, Frank Sanborn, William Lloyd Garrison, T.W. Higginson, and occasionally Horace Mann.58 In 1859-60 Emerson occasionally preached for Parker - whose huge congregation met in the spacious Music Hall in Boston- while Parker was slowly dying; and at his memorial service Emer- son reluctantly made a brief speech, complimentary, to be sure,</page><page sequence="23">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 201 but lacking warmth.59 Recalling Parker, Emerson wrote in his journal in 1861, "T.P. has beautiful fangs, and the whole ampi- theatre delights to see him worry and tear his victim."60 In June 1861 Emerson jotted in his journal, "Theodore Parker has filled up all his days and years and hours; a son of the energy of New England, restless, eager, manly, brave, early old, contumacious, clever. I can well praise him at a spectator's distance for our minds and methods were unlike, - few people more unlike."61 Still thinking of Parker in June 1863 Emerson, at the age of sixty, confided in his journal, "Take egotism out, and you would cas- trate the benefactors. Luther, Mirabeau, Napoleon, John Adams, Andrew Jackson; and our nearer eminent public servants, - Greeley, Theodore Parker, Ward Beecher, Horace Mann, Garrison would lose their vigour."62 Given these intricate interactions, what can we conclude about the personalities and worth of Emerson and Parker? At the outset Emerson's ambivalent feelings were stronger and more complex than Parker's. Parker's ambivalence toward Emerson was straight- forward and constant throughout the years; he regarded Emerson as a genius and a master prose writer, as a lover of mankind and one who was most expressive of the unique features of American life. Moreover he always thought of Emerson as a friend. To be sure, he also thought that Emerson was not well read and not in- tellectually tough enough and that his poetry was sorry stuff and his oriental mysticism not worth a farthing. He thought Emerson was a bit aloof though he never failed to think of him as some- how a reflection of the divine. These estimates of Emerson were constant throughout his life, and Parker emphasized the positive side in his published work. Furthermore he never attempted to thwart any of Emerson's plans but went out of his way to be sup- portive of them, defending his religious views, which in the early '40's were anathema to the Unitarians, and working diligently for the Dial as well as dedicating a book to Emerson which included encomiums of the Concord sage. Emerson thought Parker was a fine scholar, if one wanted to be</page><page sequence="24">202 Edward H. Madden one, but could never appreciate Parker's use of an argument - after all, intuition, he thought, was the fountainhead of truth - and could never understand that Parker's view of historical and sociological knowledge, such as that published by the Higher Critics in Germany, helped the transcendentalist cause by showing the historical and sociological origins of the supernatural features of Christianity. He admired Parker's liberal views on prison re- form, reform of capitalistic excesses, and abolition of slavery; but he never went out of his way to praise Parker. Even Parker's sup- port and defense was irritating; Emerson did not like others to defend him any more than he liked to defend himself. He never answered his Unitarian critics and simply wanted the contention to disappear. He did not particularly appreciate Parker's contribu- tions to the Dial because they did not say what he wanted to read. Moreover, he did thwart some of Parker's hopes and plans. Emerson and others only tardily invited Parker to the meetings of the Transcendental Club, Emerson prevented Parker from becom- ing editor of the Dial, was not supportive of Parker's Massachu- setts Quarterly Review, rejected Parker's request to revive the Transcendental Club, and never gave a thought to Parker as a possible member of the Saturday Club even though he had, by 1856, become an extremely influential figure. Emerson's feelings and attitudes toward Parker frequently vacil- lated through the years. In 1840 he ignored him and talked only to Ripley; two years later he referred to Parker as one who helps relieve the meannness of Boston life; in 1847 he carefully separat- ed himself from Parker's Massachusetts Quarterly Review. Accord- ing to Ralph Rusk, in 1851 Emerson felt more closely drawn to Parker because he admired his effective abolitionist activity63 - quite a turnabout for Emerson, who had earlier said of an aboli- tionist, why so hot, my little man&gt; and had written in his journal for March 1845, "What argument, what eloquence can avail against the power of that one word niggersì The man of the world annihilates the whole combined force of all the anti-slavery societies of the world by pronouncing it."64 Emerson presumably</page><page sequence="25">Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker 203 meant that the abolitionists could never prevail over the pervasive bigotry of mankind. He changed his mind in 1850 with the pass- ing of the Fugitive Slave Law and Webster's support of it; both events disturbed him greatly and he now felt that something must be done. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854 spurred him to give anti-slavery speeches, though he felt he did less well at this work than at others.65 However, in spite of Rusk's claim that Emerson thought more highly of Parker after 1851, there is no indication that Emerson expressed this greater rapprochement in any tangible way. In fact, little is known of their relationship for several years in the '50's. It will be recalled that in 1852 Parker dedicated a book to his friend Emerson while in 1856 and onward the latter never pro- posed Parker for membership in the Saturday Club. In any case, some members of the Club would no doubt have vetoed Parker's nomination, but the point is that Emerson had no interest in making such a proposal even though he had become attracted to Parker's abolitionism. At Parker's memorial service in Boston in 1860, it will be recalled, Emerson offered only a brief eulogy and that reluctantly. The upshot of the matter is that Emerson thought well of Parker as a great fighter against many injustices but felt uneasy with and aloof from this scholarly sledgehammer mind.66 Emerson could praise Parker at a distance but their intel- lectual commitments and personalities were too opposed to make a close relationship possible. Parker could be vituperative in his battles with orthodox Uni- tarians and foes of abolitionism, so it comes as a surprise when we survey Emerson's and Parker's personal remarks to discover Emer- son making sharp ones rather than Parker. He referred to Parker's "fangs," how he "worries" an opponent (presumably like a cat plays with a mouse), how like an anaconda he crushed Alcott's bones, and how if his egotism were castrated his vigour would be lost. Apparently Parker reserved his intemperate remarks for peo- ple he considered enemies; his restraint in the case of Emerson re- flects his great respect for the sage of Concord.</page><page sequence="26">204 Edward H. Madden From their intellectual and personal relationship emerge por- traits of the two men both of which are compelling in different ways. Emerson was gentle, cautious, patient, and refined, and yet not incapable of unkind cuts. He was totally incapable of living in an abrasive atmosphere. Parker was a fighter, uncautious, impa- tient, and sometimes arrogant toward his enemies. He was also loving and caring and had an ebullient nature. He had a loving feeling toward people he respected and that included Emerson. Emerson was patient and Parker impatient, a difference of great importance in understanding the inner lives of the two men. Emerson, cool and self-possessed, was never impatient with the slow progress made in fighting injustices. In his words, "There is a sublime prudence which, believing in a vast future, sure of more to come than is yet seen, postpones always the present hour to the whole life."67 Though Parker believed firmly in moral progress and had faith in the future, he nevertheless "acted as if every moment were the last, as if salvation had to come now, or never."68 He fought injustice of every kind until at the age of fifty he was totally worn out and ready to die. In a moment of real af- fection for Parker, Emerson wrote, "He was willing to perish in the using. He sacrificed the future to the present, was willing to spend and be spent; felt himself to belong to the day he lived in, and had too much to do than that he should be careful for fame. He used every day, hour, and minute; he lived to the latest mo- ment, and his character appeared in the last moments with the same firm control as in the day of strength."69 Emerson felt more comfortable with people like Agassiz, Holmes, Longfellow, and Whittier; Parker with Phillips, Garrison, Higginson, and Julia Ward Howe. These preferences are highly suggestive. Emerson generally preferred literary figures while Park- er, always a preacher and scholar but also a very political figure, preferred men of action.

Sanborn (Boston: American Unitarian Association, 1911). Emerson felt the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race and civilization and it occasionally colored his judgments; Parker was worse in this respect. To be sure, Emerson and Parker frequently criticized England and the Anglo-Saxons, but their crit- icism amounted only to this: while the Anglo-Saxon civilization was far from the ideal toward which mankind is progressing it is nevertheless closest to that goal. Both men had less than cheering things to say about blacks and foreigners.

Parker did think that blacks are intrinsically inferior to Anglo- Saxons, but this feeling did not prevent him from being enraged by their servitude and fighting gallantly against it. Emerson saw no progress of the blacks for thousands of years, but in later years he became indignant about slavery and spoke courageously against it. (Cf.
