<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham J. Heschel, The Prophets (New York - Evanston: Harper and Row, 1962). Pp. xix-518. $6.00. "It is not a prophet speaking in His name; it is predominantly God address- ing Himself to the people; it is I, not He" (p. 155). "His (the prophe≈•s) attachment to God calls upon him to be involved with humanity" (p. 172). "What the prophets proclaim is God's intimate relatedness to man. . . . Pathos is, indeed, righteousness wrapped in mystery, togetherness in holy otherness " (p. 219). "They (the prophets) disclosed attitudes of God rather than ideas about God" (p. 221). ". . . prophecy is God meeting man" (p. 227). "Plato thinks of God in the image of an idea ; the prophets think of God in the image of personal presence" (p. 275). With the poet ". . . the experience may be described as an object-object relationship " With the prophet . . it may be described as a subject-subject relationship " (p. 389). These quotations (italics are the author's) reveal the overriding concern of this important book: to plumb the essence of the biblical prophet, of prophetic inspiration and of the prophetic message. At the same time they show that the presentation is made in the same terminology and with the same underlying philosophy of the great Jewish existentialist, Martin Buber. The "I-Thou" relationship dominates the writings of both; Buber's concern is to show its necessary relevance for mankind in general; Hescheld is to show that it is the essence of prophetic thought and religion. It is a long book. A mere recital of the chapter headings and subheadings would extend this review beyond its limits. Briefly, H. first presents the message of Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, Jeremiah, Habakkuk and Second Isaiah. In succeeding chapters he examines the prophetic notions of history, divine justice, divine pathos (this is developed in several chapters), divine anger and, through some nine chapters, the distinctiveness of prophetic inspira- tion in contrast to other religious and psychological phenomena. In the manner of the biblical prophet himself, H. does not proceed with strict logic in his exposition, but by a succession of concentric circles, each one presenting the theme from a slightly different aspect. As a result there is some repetition. This is especially true of the treatments of divine pathos and of prophetic inspiration, the two most developed sections of the book. While the</page><page sequence="2">514 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 25 procedure undoubtedly has its advantages, the "Western-minded" reader is con- stantly looking, in vain, for a logical analysis and synthesis. For this reason it is difficult to provide an analysis of the book. Rather, we can only refer to the insights, and they are rich and many, that H. presents. Of greatest interest to biblical theologians is the examination of divine pathos. H. claims that the "ontocentric predicament" which led Thomas Aquinas, for example, to define God as an actus purus precludes the possibility of correctly interpreting the biblical expressions of divine pathos (pp. 260-267). The prophet discloses God as involved in history, and if this involvement has any validity, then "It is perhaps more proper to describe a prophetic passion as theomorphic than to regard the divine pathos as anthropomorphic" (p. 260). This is only one of a number of stimulating insights to be found in the book. The whole is studded with abundant references that reveal the author's acquaintance with a remarkably wide range of scholarly fields. In the areas with which the reviewer is familiar the works quoted are the best. Indices of biblical and rabbinical references and of proper names and subjects might help the "ontocentric" reader draw up his own logical exposition of the contents. Eugene H.
